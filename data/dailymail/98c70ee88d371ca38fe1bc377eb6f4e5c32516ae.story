Hurt: Daniel Curry plays one of nine Spider Man dancers in Broadway's Turn Off the Dark. His legs were pinned in the stage Thursday during a show and had to be cut out

A performer in Broadway's Spiderman: Turn Off the Dark show was is in serious condition Thursday night after he fell through a trap door in the stage and had to be sawed out and rushed to the hospital.

The audience heard screams at the Foxwood Theater on 42nd street just after 9pm as the second act of the injury-plagued play began.

The show was promptly brought to a halt and the audience ushered out the door as rescuers began cutting Daniel Curry from the floor.

‘The floor looked completely closed 
on his leg,’ audience member Melissa Kessler, of Plainview, New York told the New York Times. ‘A
stretcher was brought out, they were using a saw to cut a hole in the 
stage floor. All we cared about was whether the actor was and would be 
O.K.’

Kessler was at the show with her husband and young sons and said she very carefully explained to the boys what had happened.

Or
at least put together the night’s tragic events as best she could. Rick
Miramontez, a spokesman for the show, told the Times that he could not 
disclose the severity of Curry’s injury or its cause.

Serious: Seen here in costume during a visit to the New York Hall Of Science, Curry is now one of several performers injured in the show's troubled 3 year history. He is in serious condition

The
comic-inspired show is full of high tech special effects, complicated 
rigging built to facilitate acrobatics, and all of it is computerized as
part of the show’s expansive setup and dazzling performances.

Dazzling, that is, when it all works properly.

This
isn’t the first time serious accidents have occurred in the $65 million
production. In fact, four performers sustained injuries while the show 
was still in its preview stage.

Canceled: Here, Curry gives a performance at the New York Hall of Science. He was injured Thursday night shortly after 9pm at the start of the second act. The show was stopped and the audience was ushered out

One
of them was actress T.V. Carpio, who played the show’s villain Arachne.
Carpio was suffered an injury during a performance and had to be 
replaced for weeks.

And Carpio had herself replaced the previous Arachne, Natalie Mendoza, after she suffered a head injury and left the show.

In
2010, Christopher Tierney fell 30 feet from the rigging that was 
supposed to hold his high above the stage during  a performance.

Instead, it lead to Tierney’s fractured skull, a cracked vertebrae, and broken ribs.
