This border collie could give a trapeze artist a run for their money after learning how to balance everything from a tennis ball to a plate loaded with a roast dinner on its head.Â 

Owner Rebecca Johnson realised that her Border Collie Zelda had the unique ability to keep a tennis ball perfectly still on her nose.

From there she tried other objects, which kept getting bigger and bigger until Zelda could balance books, drinks and plates of food on her head.

Miss
Johnson, 18, from Pennsylvania, said: 'Her favorite thing to do is play
fetch with a tennis ball - it's more like an addiction than a hobby for
her.
