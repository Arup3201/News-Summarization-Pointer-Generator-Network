Most brides hope for sunshine on their wedding day, but if you're wearing one of these dresses, you are banking on it!

Asya Kozina from St Petersburg has created a range of intricate and extremely delicate wedding gowns out of plain sheets of white paper.

The Russian-born artist  studied old drawings and sepia photographs of traditional Mongolian wedding dresses and based her extravagant line on outfits worn hundreds of years ago.

Asya Kozina from St Petersburg creates intricate wedding gowns inspired by Mongolian traditional dress. The Russian artist uses paper as her material because it is more versatile 

Asya then used life-sized models in order to craft her stunning, exaggerated forms from plain sheets of white paper.

Today, Mongolian wedding clothes have bright, bold colours and patterns, but Asya believes that colour only distracts from the detailing of the gowns. 

For Asya it was extremely important to capture the elements of the wedding dresses of the past as she believes that they are one of the most accurate representations of a nation. 

Asya is fascinated with Mongolian culture and bases all of her designs around their traditional wedding dresses

Asya chose to use paper as a material as she believed it was a metaphor for 'life and art'

In order to make her designs as authentic as possible Asya studied illustrations and sepia photographs of Mongolian costumes 

She said: 'It's wedding clothing that embodies the most specific characteristics of each national costume….They are symbolic of the cultures they come from.'

Speaking to Pixable, Asya revealed that she chose to use paper as her medium as she believes as a material it is extremely versatile. 

She said: 'I see great potential in paper. It is a way to translate ideas and largely... for me, it is also a metaphor of life and art.'

The Russian-born artist chose not to use colour in her work as she believed it would be too much of a distraction 

Asya continued to say that although paper has huge potential it does cause certain problems when it comes to photographing the models. 

'There were technical difficulties in the process of shooting models because they were not able to sit down. 

'Crumpled paper cannot be restored and the shoot took about five hours.'

The artist added that she also had concerns about misrepresenting a country that she shared such a passion for. 

She said: 'Another difficulty was that I did not know how to react to Mongolians if they were to see my own rendition of their cultural costumes. What if I hurt somebody? 

'I immensely respect and love the culture of this country.'
