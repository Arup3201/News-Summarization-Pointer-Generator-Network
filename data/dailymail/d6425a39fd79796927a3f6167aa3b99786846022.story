Recovery: The comedian underwent surgery Tuesday and is 'incredibly shaken' according to his wife, Kalimar Avila Petitt (above)

The incident occurred after a man, who has not been named, was told he could not perform at the open mic night at The Local 907, where Avila was the master of ceremonies

This after he had done a routine the previous week in which he identified himself as Jesus Christ and did a demonstration using the Bible and a sex toy. 

'It was offensive on every level. And I don't get offended easily. I'm a comic,' Avila told KOMO.

He was introducing one of the evening's comedians when the man ran up and swung at him twice, before running out of the establishment.

He is currently in custody and has been denied bail.

Tragic: Avila is the father of three children (two above with wife Kalimar) and has started a Go Fund Me page to raise money for his surgery

Now, a Go Fund Me page has been created to help Avila, a father of three, with his medical bills following this brutal attack. 

As for Avila, his wife, Kalimar Avila Petitt, told The Seattle Times he is 'incredibly shaken,' but also grateful.

'He’s emotional and grateful to his friends and fellow comics that saved his life,' Avila Petitt said.

'We’re both pretty overwhelmed with how amazing the outpouring of support has been.'
