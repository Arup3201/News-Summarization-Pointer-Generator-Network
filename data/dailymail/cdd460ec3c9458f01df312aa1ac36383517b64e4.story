Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has admitted Robin van Persie was a ‘lucky boy’ not to have been dropped a fortnight ago after a poor spell of form.

Van Persie, 31, will lead the line against Liverpool  after scoring three goals in his last three games, including a match-winning double at Southampton on Monday night.

But Van Gaal indicated he was ready to leave out his fellow Dutchman — only to have his hand forced by injuries to other players.

Van Persie played against Hull on November 29 under severe pressure after a run of one goal in six games and having only 13 touches in a win at Arsenal.

But Falcao and James Wilson weren’t fit enough to start against Hull and though Wilson had recovered to face Stoke three days later, Wayne Rooney was missing because of a knee injury.

Van Gaal said: ‘I am very happy for Van Persie that he is scoring goals. He wasn’t playing very well before but he was a lucky boy because Falcao was injured, Rooney can play in a lot of positions and Wilson is a young talent who has to show himself in training sessions.

‘I have always played with two strikers, only three or four times with one striker, so maybe he was lucky.’

Van Gaal says he will resist the temptation to rush back Angel Di Maria (hamstring) and Phil Jones (hamstring), although both are training.

He expects Mario Balotelli to play some part for Liverpool today, saying of the Italian: ‘It is difficult for other teams to manage him, but it is also difficult for his team-mates!’
