A bidding-war is stirring among high flying millionaires in a desperate move to snap up the world's first aeroplane car - which is up for sale for £600,000.

With cars and congestion becoming too much for commuters in the 1940s, pioneering inventor Moulton Taylor developed a way to soar above the rest.

The American designer built the first-ever Aerocar in 1949 and successfully proved that the roadster - complete with foldable wings to keep a street-worthy size - could be done.

A bidding-war is stirring among high flying millionaires in a desperate move to snap up the worlds first aeroplane car - which is up for sale for £600,000

With cars and congestion becoming too much for commuters in the 1940s, pioneering inventor Moulton Taylor developed a way to soar above the rest

The Aerocar was set to take the world by storm but after almost 25 years of campaigning Taylor still could still not strike a deal - he even lost a deal with auto giants Ford.

Along with the original prototype, only four others were ever built and madcap collectors are battling to own the startling piece of engineering history - which is still able to cruise at 110mph.

Greg Herrick, of aviation enthusiast Historic Sales, said: 'This was the peak of 20th century design at the time and was close to taking the world's imagination by storm.

The first-ever Aerocar was built in 1949 and successfully proved that the roadster - complete with folding wings to keep it a street-worthy size - could be done

The Aerocar's creator was a gifted aeronautical engineer who was 'crazy about airplanes' and the battle to become a proud owner of the car has been extreme

'There really was nothing like it around at the time and the design attracted so much attention - it was such an incredibly advanced piece of kit.

'It was on the front of newspapers, magazines, books and on TV shows across the globe - it's popularity was unprecedented.

'But the oil crash in the 1970s and a lack of businesses willing to invest eventually led to all interest fizzling away - to this day there is still nothing like it.'

Not only can it be readily converted from an airplane to a car, but its wings can be folded back along the sides of the detached fuselage and towed behind the automobile like a trailer

The Aerocar was set to take the world by storm but after almost 25 years of campaigning, Taylor still could still not strike a deal - he even lost a deal with auto giant Ford

Engine:  Lycoming 0-320, 4-cylinder, rated at 150 hp Length Overall (as an airplane): 21ft Height Overall (as an airplane): 7 ft. 2 in Length of car portion: 10 ft 4 in Length of trailer portion: 13 ft  Width of trailer:  8 ftWingspan: 30 ftWing Chord: 6 ft. 3 in.Wing Area:  168 sq. ft.Seat (car) Width:  44 in.Baggage Space: 24 cu. ft.Gross Weight: 2,100 lbs.Empty Weight: 1,300 lbs.Useful Load:  800 lbs.Payload w/ 24 gal. Fuel: 656 lbs.Maximum Speed: 110 mphCruise Speed: 100 mphApproach Speed: 68 mphLanding Speed: 55 mphService Ceiling: 12,000 ft.Fuel Capacity: 24 gal.Oil Capacity: 7 qts.Cruising Range: 300 miles

The 21ft Aerocar is a two-place aircraft with side-by-side seating, four wheels, 30ft wingspan and a single Lycoming 0-320 engine mounted over the rear wheels.

The propeller is mounted at the end of a long tail cone, and the latter is angled up considerably, to provide adequate propeller clearance. Its cruise speed is 100mph, and it initially sold for $25,000.

Not only can it be readily converted from an airplane to a road-going car, but also its wings can be folded back along the sides of the detached fuselage and towed behind the automobile like a trailer.

The idea for the Aerocar occurred to its designer Taylor in 1946. After meeting inventor Robert E. Fulton, Jr. he became captivated by the concept of his flying car.

Molt immediately saw the weakness in the fixed, detachable wings of Fulton's design, and set about building his prototype Aerocar with folding wings, which he completed in 1949.

After a successful demonstration flight, Molt promoted the Aerocar at aircraft and auto shows and on TV.

As the flood of inquiries poured in, Molt raised money to certify the machine as an airplane, and to build four 'pre-production' Aerocars for demonstrations and eventual sale.

Taylor built his first 'production' Aerocar in 1954 and flew them, as he attempted to develop a market into the early 1960s.

He used fiberglass on the cars' outer panels to keep the weight down and developed a front wheel drive because the rear wheels were used for landing. 

Takeoff speed was 55 mph and the airplane was controlled with the same steering wheel.

One Aerocar is owned by the Smithsonian museum group, one is in the EAA museum and two are in private hands

Molt was a gifted aeronautical engineer who was 'crazy about airplanes' and the battle to become a proud owner of the car has been extreme.

Greg said: 'There are four surviving Aerocars out of five built.  One is owned by the Smithsonian museum group, one is in the EAA museum and two are in private hands.

'The prototype for the next generation is in the Boeing museum in Seattle.

'It's a really rare chance to buy this.'
