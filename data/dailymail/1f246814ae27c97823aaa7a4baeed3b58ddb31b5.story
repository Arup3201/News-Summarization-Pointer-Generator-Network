Ebony Wilkerson, who has given birth to her fourth child in a hospital psychiatric unit

A pregnant mother who is accused of deliberately driving her minivan into the ocean to kill her three children inside has given birth to her fourth child, it has been reported.

Ebony Wilkerson, from South Carolina was charged with attempted murder after driving her minivan from the state and into the ocean at Daytona Beach, Florida, while 28 weeks pregnant.

She also attempted to harm her unborn child when she was seen ‘beating her stomach with her fists’ after her arrest.

The mother was in a hospital psychiatric unit, where she gave birth to her fourth child on Wednesday.

A spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families told the Daytona Beach News-Journal that the newborn is with family members.

The baby's gender is unknown.

It is unclear who will have custody of the baby or who is caring for her other three children, who had to be rescued by witnesses and lifeguards after the incident.

An attorney representing the children's father, Lutful Ronjon says he doesn't have the children.

The 32-year-old is required to stay in psychiatric care until she is fit to be sent to jail.

Mrs Wilkerson's family said she drove her vehicle into the water in March, just days after leaving her husband.

Her children have told investigators she had been behaving erratically since arriving in Florida.

Tourists on the beach caught the 
horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that the mother was 
physically able to escape the vehicle.

In video taken by Simon Besner, a tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards try to pull her children, aged three, nine and 10, from inside the vehicle.

Witnesses described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children remained seat-belted in the back as waves nearly pushed her under the van.

Several men frantically tried to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan before they are eventually pulled to safety.

She was arrested a few days later and remains in custody on $1.2 million bail. She faces three counts each of attempted second-degree murder and child abuse.

Her attorneys have filed notice they may seek an insanity defence.
