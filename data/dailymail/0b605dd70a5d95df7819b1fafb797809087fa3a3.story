Virgin Australia Melbourne Fashion Festival came to a close on Sunday night with a grand finale presentation by Romance Was Born.

Top Models Samantha Harris and Montana Cox walked the runway wearing designs from the Australian label's latest collection, Bush Magic.

The A/W2015 line takes inspiration from May Gibb's iconic Gumnut Babies children's books, said designers Anna Plunkett and Luke Sales.

Montana appeared wearing a black ensemble adorned with bright yellow wattles designed to resemble a native acacia plant.

The brunette beauty wore an acacia headpiece, and her make up featured rosy red cheeks just as the cherubic Gumnut Babies' from Snugglepot and Cuddlepie books.

Montana also wore heavy black eye shadow and liner creating a rounded eye shape, while Samantha had the same look in metallic silver.

Samantha Harris walked the catwalk in a eucalyptus green dress adorned with black flowers, accessorising with a black bowler hat adorned with gum nuts.

Of the collection, Romance Was Born said it was inspired by 'Romance Was Born's nostalgia for childhood stories and dreams, our national treasure May Gibbs and her cherubic Gumnut Babies and the freedom of growing up in the Australian outback.'

After nine day of runway presentations and special events, the VAMFF closing show was held at the National Gallery of Victoria.

The NGV is also the site of Plunkett and Sales' Express Yourself exhibition aimed at children, which runs until April 12.

The exhibition, which ran across the summer, is an interactive experience that encourages children to draw and create accessories inspired by the work of Romance Was Born.
