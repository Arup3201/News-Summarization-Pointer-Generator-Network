You'd think that if your father was a millionaire rock star that money would be the least of your worries.

But Ronnie Wood’s son has revealed how he hustled and dealt drugs to earn a few pounds because the Rolling Stone was so ‘tight’ with his cash.

Jamie Wood, who is now an art dealer, was expelled from a Somerset boarding school when he was 16 after he was caught selling cannabis to his classmates.

Tight: Jamie Wood said his adoptive father Ronnie, who is worth £20million, made him build his own career

Asked if his art career was bankrolled by his father, who is said to be worth £20million, he said: 'Dude, what are you thinking? My old man is tight. I’d say, “Dad, I’m going out”, and he’d give me a tenner.

'That’s why I was always hustling from a young age, so I wouldn’t have to ask him for nothing.

'I was a hustler. That’s what I did. I’m into money and making money.'

The gallery owner, now 39, also told how he would challenge Rolling Stones band members to games of pool to make extra cash.

Brother in arms: Ronnie brought Jamie up as his own alongside his other sons Jesse and Tyrone Wood

Jamie's mother is Jo Wood, Ronnie's former wife, who met the rocker when her first-born was just a baby

Jamie was adopted in the 1970s as a baby by Ronnie when the musician got together with his mother Jo.

His biological father is clothing boss Peter Greene.

The father-of-three has recently spoken out about his shock following the death of L'Wren Scott, girlfriend of Sir Mick Jagger.

The 39-year-old art dealer was expelled from boarding school for dealing cannabis, but build himself up

He told The Times the entire inner circle of the Rolling Stones and their families are in still coming to terms with the circumstances.

Asked if he thinks Mick can overcome 
the tragic loss, he replied: ‘Yeah, course. He's been through plenty of 
things. But you never know how things may affect people, you just wish 
them luck and hope that they get through okay at a terrible time.

‘Things like that are difficult because they're so unexpected.’
