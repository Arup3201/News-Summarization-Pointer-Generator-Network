The wire: Karen Dziewit, 24, was charged with unlawful wiretapping after secretly recording her arrest for disorderly conduct

A 24-year-old Massachusetts woman was charged with unlawful wiretapping after secretly recording her arrest for disorderly conduct.

The Springfield Police Department accused Karen Dziewit of drinking outside a building at about 2am Sunday. She’s also accused of yelling and disturbing residents and refusing to quiet down.

When the 24-year-old Dziewit was about to be taken into custody, police say she turned on a recording feature on her smartphone, hid it in her purse and captured her arrest.

Ms Dziewit was charged with unlawful wiretapping, disorderly conduct and an open container violation.

On Monday, the Chicopee resident was arraigned and released on her own recognizance. She is due back in court July 8 for a pre-trial hearing.

Under a Massachusetts state law, it is illegal to record someone's voice without the person's knowledge or permission.

Chapter 272, Section 99 of the General Laws states that it is against the law 'to secretly hear, secretly record, or aid another to secretly hear or secretly record the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any intercepting device by any person other than a person given prior authority by all parties to such communication.'

The incident that landed Karen Dziewit behind bars took place at around 2am Sunday outside of 140 Chestnut Street in Chicopee.

According to the arrest report obtained by The Springfield Republican, police officers Jameson Williams and Clay Canning were called to the scene after receiving reports of a verbal spat in the street involving a woman and two men.

The responding officers identified Dziewit as the 'aggressor' in the fight and observed in their report that she had a 'strong odor of alcohol emanating from her person.'

The 24-year-old woman was described as being very irate, and her demeanor grew more belligerent as the officers tried to calm her down. 

One of her companions explained to police that the trio were driving home from a bar in West Springfield when Dziewit became upset over an argument they had earlier in the evening.

The report states that when Dziewit and her two friends got out of the car on Chestnut Street, the woman slapped one of the men in the face.

Belligerent: Dziewit got into a fight with two male friends on her way home from a bar, and she refused to stop yelling even after two responding officers and passersby pleaded with her to calm down

After the two officers responded to the scene of the altercation, they said Dziewit continued shouting obscenities at her two male companions, and screamed at the cops that they didn’t know how to do their jobs.

According to the arrest report, the woman then demanded Canning and Williams' badge numbers claiming that she was in 'law school,' and that she was going to get the two of them 'fired.'

The Chicopee resident continued yelling even after two passersby pleaded with her to settle down, police said.

As the woman refused to stop screaming, Canning and Williams decided to arrest her for disorderly conduct.

That is when the 24-year-old cried out: 'I've been recording this the whole time, my phone is in my purse, see in court.'

When the officers searched Dziewit's bag, they reportedly found her cell phone with the voice recorder switched on, as well as an empty half-pint of Five O’clock Vodka.

Massachusetts is one of a dozen 'two-party consent' states where it is prohibited by law to secretly record a conversation with someone.

However, in 2011, an appeals court citing First and Fourth Amendment rights ruled in favor of a Boston attorney who was arrested for videotaping police activity in public.
