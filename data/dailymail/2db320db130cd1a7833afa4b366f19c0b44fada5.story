Major commercial airlines have created a virtual 'no fly' zone' over Ukraine after cancelling or redirecting flights in the wake of the attack on flight MH17.

British Airways, KLM and Virgin Atlantic are among the international operators who have altered their journeys after the Malaysia Airlines aircraft was shot down  near the Russia-Ukraine border.

The traffic control body Eurocontrol has also advised airlines to avoid the area as a safety precaution.

Avoiding the area: A map from airline tracker FlightRadar24, shows that a large number of planes (highlighted in yellow) have been diverted away from Ukrainian airspace

Airliner tracking sites, including FlightRadar24, are indicating that traffic is now steering clear of Ukrainian airspace.

Air France, KLM, Turkish Airlines, Alitalia and Delta have also diverted their services while German providers Lufthansa said they were taking a 'wide detour' around the region. 

A  spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said: 'The Ukrainian authorities are responsible for managing their airspace and the UK or other countries cannot enforce airspace restrictions in the area.

'However, the CAA has previously issued advice to UK airlines on operating in this area and following this incident, Eurocontrol (the European air traffic control body) has issued advice to airlines to plan routes that avoid the area.'

A British Airways spokesman said the only flight that would be flying in the area was the daily service between Heathrow and Kiev.

'The safety and security of our customers is always our top priority.' they said.

'Our flights are not using Ukrainian airspace with the exception of our once-a-day service between Heathrow and Kiev. We are keeping this service under review but Kiev is several hundred kilometres from the incident site.' 

A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said: 'Our thoughts are with all involved in the recent Malaysian Airlines incident. We are closely monitoring the situation and as a precautionary measure are re-routing a small number of flights this evening.'

The flights are the Heathrow to Dubai route and the Mumbai to Heathrow route. 

Budget airlines Ryaniar and Easyjet have not been affected as they do not use Ukrainian air space. 

Delta tweeted: 'Out of an abundance of caution, Delta is not routing flights through Ukrainian airspace.' 

Many airlines had continued to use the route despite warnings not to because of the fighting, said Norman Shanks, former head of group security at airports group BAA and professor of aviation security at Coventry University in England.

'It is a busy aviation route and there have been suggestions that a notice was given to aviators telling airlines to avoid that particular area,' Shanks said.

'But Malaysia Airlines, like a number of other carriers, have been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route, which means less fuel and therefore less money.'
