Two Royal Navy veterans are thought to be the oldest surviving brothers who fought together on D-Day.

Ernie Dale, 90, and his brother Johnny, 94, were just 20 and 24-years-old on June 6, 1944, but can recall the Allied invasion of occupied northern France during the Second World War in vivid detail.

The pair were able seamen on board HMS Frobisher - just one of thousands of vessels that made up the largest seaborne invasion in history, helping to path the way for an Allied victory over Nazi Germany the following year.

Remembering D-Day, Ernie, who lives in Kent, said: 'We were expendable. We were there to take the fire while the landing craft headed for the beaches.'

During the chaos of the invasion, Ernie remembers firing upon his Nazi targets while Johnny relayed shells from the ammunition locker to his younger brother.

Despite coming close to death several times over a 
three-month campaign, the brave brothers admit they ‘didn’t really know 
what fear was’ because they were so young. 

Although they came under heavy shelling from the Nazis in their fortresses lining the Normandy beaches, Ernie said he did not fear death.

'I went out with the feeling that it wasn’t going to happen to me - and it didn’t. We were just lucky.'

'I
 was quite comfortable really, I felt sorry for the troops heading for 
the beaches because they probably only had corned beef and biscuits to 
eat.'

Ernie 
joined Johnny in Mombasa, Kenya on HMS Resolution in 1942, after being 
called up for military service at the age of 18. The elder brother had 
been in the Royal Navy since war broke out in 1939.

They
 were placed on the Frobisher, then part of the Eastern Fleet, and 
served for a year off the coast of Africa before being called back to 
fight for D-Day.

Plans for the original invasion on June 5 were scuppered by bad weather keeping allied air, sea and land troops at bay. But by dawn the next day after the RAF had bombed from the air and the young brothers sailed into history.

During the invasion, Ernie directed anti-aircraft guns on board the warship while Johnny supplied shells from the bowels of the vessel.

A
 total of five rounds per minute were fired from HMS Frobisher, which 
had five seven-inch guns and five four-inch guns, for two hours.

Describing how close the men came to death, Ernie said: 'There were coloured buoys in the water which the Germans put there for range... So if you were near one of them you could expect to be fired upon or hit.'

It took a full five minutes to turn the ship around once the sailors realised they were sitting targets, Ernie said. The vessel was fired upon by around 60 shells but none scored a direct hit.

Two off-duty crew members standing together watching the action lost arms during the attack after being hit by shrapnel.

After the war was over in 1945, widower Ernie returned to his profession as a carpenter and started a family.

He has three children, Karen, 60, Dennis, 59, and John, 62, six grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

His
 brother Johnny, who has two sons, Colin, 56, and Martin, 52, was 
diagnosed with TB and spent years after the war in hospital. But despite being unwell, Johnny met his wife in a sanatorium.

'I was demobbed and sent to hospital with £25 as a reward but I had TB and I was upset,'  he said.

'It was the early 50s before I was fit enough for work, but when I was in the sanatorium I met Brenda.'

'Every
 morning you had to go on the scales so the doctors could check your 
weight. I always said Brenda was weighing me up when she was looking at 
me.'

After recovering from his illness Johnny went on to become an executive at BT, finally retiring in 1984.

The brothers will both attend a special ceremony for veterans at Caen in Normandy tomorrow, where they are due to be presented with commemorative medals.

The brothers and their children will be with them on a poignant day at the Abbaye aux Dames.

'We are aware of our ages and it’s probably the last chance we will have to go back,' Ernie said.

The
 landings on June 6, 1944 involved a combination of British, Canadian, 
American and French forces, including hundreds of units from the Royal 
Navy.

About
 132,000 Royal Marines and Allied soldiers were transported by ships and
 injected onto the beaches of Normandy by landing craft and sea boat.

More
 than 23,000 arriving by air, according to the Ministry of Defence, and 
the RAF and allied air forces provided air support with 11,000 aircraft.

D-Day
 was the largest seaborne invasion ever launched and opened the gateway 
to victory for the British and allied forces to bring the Second World 
War to an end.

Around 10,000 troops and civilians were killed but the actual figure has never been discovered.

To
 mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day, an international flotilla of ships 
will sail through the channel to Normandy before an international 
ceremony on Sword Beach.

Services
 led by the British and the French will be held at Bayeux Cathedral 
followed by an event at the Bayeux Commonwealth War Graves Commission 
Cemetery.
