For more than 60 years, historians and literary researchers have wondered about the identity of Hannah Crafts, the mysterious author of 'The Bondwoman's Narrative'.

The 'Bondwoman's Narrative' is an account of life as a house slave written in the 1850s, but was only discovered in 1948.

While the account has been verified, until recently the author's identity has alluded experts.

Case solved: A professor in South Carolina claims to have ended the 60-year mystery surrounding the life of 'The Bondwoman's Narrative' author Hannah Crafts, who wrote about life as a slave after escaping the south

Yesterday, in the New York Times, a professor in South Carolina stepped forward saying he finally traced Crafts' roots back to a woman named Hannah Bond, who lived a very similar life as the novel's protagonist.

End of Story: Winthop University professor Gregg Hecimovich traced Hannah Crafts origins to a slave born in North Carolina named Hannah Bond

Dorothy Parker Wesley, a Howard University black history archivist, discovered the manuscript in 1948 at a New York City bookseller and bought the book for $85.

More than 50 years later in 2001, the manuscript went up for auction and was won for $8,500 by African-American historian Henry Louis Gates.

Within a year, Mr Gates verified the manuscript and said it was written before 1861 since there was no mention of the war or secession. Other experts agreed after analyzing the ink and paper.

Publishers were quick to snap up the rights to the narrative with a female perspective of life as a slave and in 2002 it was published by Warner Books.

But without a confirmed identity for the author, literary researchers found it hard to make any sort of statement on the account.

'I think there was some suspended judgement because we didn't have a traceable historical person,' William Andrews, an English professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill told the Times. 'We had leads. We had all sorts of interesting inferences. But we couldn't talk about the book without any confidence of authorial intention if we didn't know who the author was.'

Professor Gregg Hecimovich, a Victorian literature expert at Winthrop University, seems to have made the most convincing pitch so far: Hannah Crafts was really Hannah Bond.

He came to this conclusion after conducting interviews and studying wills, diaries, handwritten almanacs and public records which led him to the slave who worked at the plantation owned by John Hill Wheeler in Murfreesboro, North Carolina.

Wheeler was a prominent North Carolinian who would go on to serve as North Carolina State Treasurer and the United States Minister to Nicaragua.

Bond was a self-educated woman who waited on the lady of the house, Ellen Wheeler.

But in 1867 she escaped, dressed as a man in a suit, possibly given to her by a Wheeler family member.

Clues: Left, a picture of Plantation owner John Wheeler. The plantation often took boarders from a local school where they had to memorize excerpts of Charles Dickens' Bleak House, which is referenced in Crafts' book

She escaped first to Upstate New York before eventually settling in New Jersey, marrying, and becoming a school teacher.

In Upstate New York she was sheltered by a family by the last name of Crafts, hence the author's pseudonym.

Mr Gates, the manuscript's owner, believes the conclusion and so do other respected African American historians.

Hollis Robbins of John Hopkins University called it a 'tremendous finding'.

Robbins said she was 'totally convinced' Bonds is Crafts 'to the extent that anything historical can be documented without an iPhone picture of her writing the novel.'

Mr Hecimovich plans to publish his case in a book tentatively titled 'The Life and Times of Hannah Crafts'.

It may be that I assume to[o] much responsibility in attempting to write these pages. The world will probably say so, and I am aware of my deficiencies. I am neither clever, nor learned, nor talented. When a child they used to scold and find fault with me because they said I was dull and stupid. Perhaps under other circumstances and with more encouragement I might have appeared better; for I was shy and reserved and scarce dared open my lips to any one I had none of that quickness and animation which are so much admired in children, but rather a silent unobtrusive way of observing things and events, and wishing to understand them better than I could.I was not brought up by any body in particular that I know of. I had no training, no cultivation. The birds of the air, or beasts of the field are not freer from moral culture than I was. No one seemed to care for me till I was able to work, and then it was Hannah do this and Hannah do that, but I never complained as I found a sort of pleasure and something to divert my thoughts in employment. Of my relatives I knew nothing. No one ever spoke of my father or mother, but I soon learned what a curse was attached to my race, soon learned that the African blood in my veins would forever exclude me from the higher walks of life. That toil unremitted unpaid toil must be my lot and portion, without even the hope or expectation of any thing better. This seemed the harder to be borne, because my complexion was almost white, and the obnoxious descent could not be readily traced, though it gave a rotundity to my person, a wave and curl to my hair, and perhaps led me to fancy pictorial illustrations and flaming colors.The busiest life has its leisure moments; it was so with mine. I had from the first an instinctive desire for knowledge and the means of mental improvement. Though neglected and a slave, I felt the immortal longings in me. In the absence of books and teachers and schools I determined to learn if not in a regular, approved, and scientific way. I was aware that this plan would meet with opposition, perhaps with punishment. My master never permitted his slaves to be taught. Education in his view tended to enlarge and expand their ideas; made them less subservient to their superiors, and besides that its blessings were destined to be conferred exclusively on the higher and nobler race. Indeed though he was generally easy and good-tempered, there was nothing liberal or democratic in his nature. Slaves were slaves to him, and nothing more. Practically he regarded them not as men and women, but in the same light as horses or other domestic animals. He furnished supplied their necessities of food and clothing from the same motives of policy, but [di]scounted the ideas of equality and fraternity as preposterous and absurd. Of course I had nothing to expect from him, yet 'where there's a will there's a way.'
