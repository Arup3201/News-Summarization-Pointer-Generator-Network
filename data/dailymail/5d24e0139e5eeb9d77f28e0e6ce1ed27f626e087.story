Prime Minister David Cameron sought to 'bust myths' about the jobs market, insisting most people getting a job were now in well-paid, full-time work

Britain is now the 'jobs factory of Europe', David Cameron boasted today as he vowed a Tory government would take employment to world-beating levels.

The Prime Minister sought to 'bust myths' about the jobs market, insisting most people getting a job were now in well-paid, full-time work.

But he was forced to admit that he will miss his pledge to reduce migration, blaming the booming jobs market for making Britain too attractive to migrants.

In a speech in Ipswich today, the Prime Minister set out a goal for 'full employment' in Britain, overtaking all other G7 countries.

The UK is currently fourth – at 72 per cent – just behind Canada and Japan. Germany is top at 74 per cent.

He said that in the last year 9 in 10 who found work were in full-time jobs. 

The Prime Minister admitted it had been a 'tough few years' for UK plc, but said the country was 'coming out the other side' - and urged voters to stick with his plan.

'Full employment may be an economic term, but this is what it means in human terms: it means more of our fellow men and women with the security of a regular wage; it means you, your family and your children having a job and getting on in life,' Mr Cameron said.

'We have had a tough few years as a country, but we are coming out the other side.

'We are the jobs factory of Europe; we're creating more jobs here than the rest of Europe put together. That's what our long-term plan means for you - and if you vote Conservative, we can stay on this road to recovery.'

The premier outlined five key Conservative commitments for the next Parliament:

Mr Cameron sought to appeal directly to small businesses, with four months before the election.

'The Conservatives are the party of small businesses. We're the party of the roofers and the retailers; the builders and the businesswomen,' Mr Cameron said.

'We're the ones who back people who strike out on their own, take the risks, and create wealth and jobs in our country.

'These are people we admire and want to help. Other parties preach about this sort of stuff; but we're the ones who really deliver,' he said. 

Britain is currently ranked fourth in the G7 league table for employment, but David Cameron wants to move to overtake Germany, Japan and Canada

Mr Cameron announced a trebling of the Start-Up Loans scheme, which hands out sums of around £5,000 to help young entrepreneurs. 

At least 75,000 loans will have been made by the 2020, according to the PM, creating at least 100,000 jobs. 

Speaking alongside former US Treasury secretary Larry Summer at the launch of a report from the Commission on Inclusive Prosperity, shadow chancellor Ed Balls is expected to dismiss the idea that the British economy is 'fixed'.

'The biggest economic challenge for our generation is to deliver sustained rises in living standards for all working people,' he will say.

'While growth has returned in many countries, working people on middle and low incomes are still seeing wages stagnating.

'Here in Britain working people are now GBP1,600 a year worse off since

2010 and this is a key reason why the Government has failed to balance the books.

'And it is why David Cameron and George Osborne are completely out of touch when they try to tell people in Britain that the economy is fixed.

'In the short term, falling global oil prices may bring some respite for consumers across the world. But that is no substitute for tackling the deep-seated problem of our economy not working for working people.'

Last week Mr Cameron was criticised for not making immigration one of his top six priorities – but it formed part of today's pitch on jobs. 

He  committed to 'controlling immigration and delivering a robust welfare system for EU migrants'.

In addition, he  promised to back small businesses by keeping taxes low and cutting red tape; invest in infrastructure; lower the benefit cap to reward work; and create three million more apprenticeships.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'David Cameron's empty promises of full employment will mean nothing to so many people struggling with empty wallets as a result of the low-wage economy.' 

Labour's Ed Balls dismissed the idea that the British economy is 'fixed'. Speaking alongside former US Treasury secretary Larry Summer at the launch of a report from the Commission on Inclusive Prosperity, the shadow chancellor said: 'The biggest economic challenge for our generation is to deliver sustained rises in living standards for all working people,' he will say.

'While growth has returned in many countries, working people on middle and low incomes are still seeing wages stagnating.

'Here in Britain working people are now £1,600 a year worse off since 2010 and this is a key reason why the Government has failed to balance the books.'

John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce said: 'Full employment should be a goal for any government, but it can only be achieved when Britain's businesses are firing on all cylinders. 

'The best way to achieve full employment is to create the conditions that enable businesses to grow and take on staff, so the Prime Minister's focus on infrastructure, access to finance and preparing people for the world of work is surely right.'
