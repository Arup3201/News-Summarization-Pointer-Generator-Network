This is the moment a fearless gnu decided to take life into its own hands by chasing away a deadly cheetah.

After coming face-to-face with the ferocious feline, the two animals are seen locked in a tense showdown near the Masai Mara River, Kenya.

But instead of fleeing from the life or death situation, the gallant gnu decides to stand its ground and is even seen charging directly towards the unsuspecting predator.

Courageous: This is the moment a fearless gnu decided to take life into its own hands by chasing away a deadly cheetah

Captured by photographer, Vadim Onishchenko, 34, the big cat is left looking a little dazed by the surprise encounter.

Mr Onishchenko said: 'It had been a pretty uneventful safari ride when we noticed the cheetah darting to catch the gnu.

'The cheetah didn't quite manage to bring the gnu down and the two ended up staring at each other waiting for the other one to make a move.

'I was really stunned the gnu could be so aggressive and it managed to frighten the cheetah away.

'I don't think the cheetah expected the gnu to fight so ferociously, it really did catch the cheetah off guard, it was a hunter becomes the hunted situation.

'Fortunately, I managed to get some shots of the cheetah after it was chased away, it didn't seem too happy about missing out on a meal.

'Nature is so amazing I never know what I am going to see when I am out in the wild, I think that is why I love my job as a professional photographer so much.'
