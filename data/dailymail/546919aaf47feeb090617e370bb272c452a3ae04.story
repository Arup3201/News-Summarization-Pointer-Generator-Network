Grind TV reports that the crew was unable to tell if the dolphin was a true albino, which would require pink eyes, or simply a partial albino, which would exhibit blue eyes.

,,'this little one kept coming to the surface with its eyes closed,' Galieti wrote on the company's Facebook. 

She added in an email: 'It also exhibited some play behaviors, like pec-fin slapping and rolling. All the guests were excited to see something so stunning.'

They also typically appear dark gray with scars generally caused by other Risso dolphins, squids, and parasites. 

They usually stay far from the shoreline and are very rare.
