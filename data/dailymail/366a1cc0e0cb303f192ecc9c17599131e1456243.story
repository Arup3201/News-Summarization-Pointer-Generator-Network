A New Jersey-based Army major and his wife have been accused of torturing their three foster children, breaking bones, force-feeding them hot sauce, denying them water and using one of their biological kids to guard toilet bowls and sinks to ensure the foster kids couldn't get access to water.

Carolyn Jackson, 35, was arrested Tuesday morning at their Mount Holly home, while John Jackson, 37, surrendered to federal agents a short while later.

The couple have been charged with 17-counts includes conspiracy to endanger the welfare of a child, assault and more than a dozen counts of endangering the welfare of a child.

The case is being prosecuted federally because the offenses were allegedly committed at the Picatinny Arsenal Installation in Morris County, the military base where Major Jackson is based.

According to the indictment, the Jacksons engaged in a constant course of neglect and cruelty toward the three children they fostered and then adopted from August 2005 through April 2010 while they lived at Picatinny Arsenal, which is about 35 miles west of New York City.

One of their adopted children, referred to by the initials ‘J.J. (hash)2,’ died in May 2008; although the Jacksons have not been charged in connection to that child's death.

During the five years of abuse, the Jacksons allegedly ordered their three biological children not to report the physical assaults, telling them the punishments were supposed to ‘train’ the adopted children how to behave properly, reports NBC4.

Prosecutors say the Jacksons allegedly physically assaulted their children with various objects, giving two of them broken bones. The couple then allegedly denied the injured children medical attention.

On other occasions, the couple allegedly withheld food and water from their foster children, at times denying them water altogether, and beat the children when they were caught trying to sneak something to eat or drink.

The couple allegedly ordered one of their own biological children to guard the sinks and toilet bowls in their home on the military base to prevent the foster children from access to water.

The Jacksons are also accused of using food as punishment, allegedly forcing their foster children to eat quantities of red pepper flakes, hot sauce, raw onion and salt.

One of the foster child was allegedly beaten with a belt after they attempted to report the abuse they were experiencing.

Authorities say the Jacksons also gave officials false medical histories or blamed the injuries on the adoptive children's biological mother when questioned.

‘Carolyn and John Jackson are charged with unimaginable cruelty to children they were trusted to protect,’ said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in a statement.

‘The
crimes alleged should not happen to any child, anywhere, and it is 
deeply disturbing that they would happen on a military installation. 
Along with the FBI, we will continue to seek justice for our 
communities' most vulnerable victims.’

The Jacksons appeared in federal court in Newark on Tuesday and were temporarily denied bail.

Their two foster children and three biological children are currently in the custody of the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency.
