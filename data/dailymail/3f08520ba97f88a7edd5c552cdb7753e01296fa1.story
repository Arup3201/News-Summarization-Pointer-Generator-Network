"Man of Steel" leaped over box office expectations in a single weekend.

The Warner Bros. superhero film earned $113 million in its 
opening weekend at the box office, according to studio estimates Sunday. The 
retelling of Superman's backstory earned an additional $12 million from Thursday 
screenings, bringing its domestic total to $125 million. Original expectations 
for "Man of Steel" ranged from $75 million to $130 million.

"They finally got the Superman formula right," said Paul 
Dergarabedian, an analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com. "Superhero 
movies really are the bread and butter of the summer box office. The fact that 
`Iron Man 3' has the biggest opening of the year so far and `Man of Steel' has 
the second biggest opening of the year just proves that."

"Man of Steel," which stars Henry Cavill as Superman and Amy 
Adams as Lois Lane, also toppled the record for biggest opening in June held by 
the Disney-Pixar film "Toy Story 3," which banked $110 million when it opened in 
2010. "Superman Returns," the previous Superman film starring Brandon Routh in 
the titular role, launched with a respectable $52.5 million in 2006.

Sony's "This Is the End" opened in second place behind "Man 
of Steel" with $20.5 million in its opening weekend. The comedy starring Seth 
Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson as versions of themselves 
trapped in a mansion during the apocalypse opened Wednesday, earning a domestic 
total of $32.8 million. The film cost just $32 million to produce.

"We knew we were going to have competition, but we felt our 
movie stood on its own and had its own voice," said Rory Bruer, Sony's president 
of worldwide distribution. "I believe we've absolutely proven that. To have this 
amount of money in the bank with its cost of production, good reviews and word 
of mouth really puts our feet on solid ground."

In its third weekend at the box office, the Lionsgate 
illusionist heist film "Now You See Me" fleeced $10.3 million in third place, 
bringing its total domestic haul to $80 million. Universal's "Fast & Furious 
6" arrived in fourth place with $9.4 million, while the studio's invasion horror 
film "The Purge" starring Ethan Hawke scared up $8.2 million in the fifth 
spot.

The super openings of "Man of Steel" and "This Is the End" 
helped to lift the box office 50 percent over last year when "Madagascar 3" and 
"Prometheus" held on to the top spots. "Man of Steel" will face off against 
stiff competition next week when Paramount's zombie thriller "World War Z" and 
the Disney-Pixar's prequel "Monster's University" both debut.

Canadian theaters, according to Hollywood.com. Where available, latest 
international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be released
