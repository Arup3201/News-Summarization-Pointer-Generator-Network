It looks innocent enough. An ancient piece of pottery, in pretty good condition aside from a few cracks here and there.

However, this artefact is causing somewhat of a stink in archeological circles.

It
was assumed this ancient relic was a piece of tableware when it was 
unearthed at a ruined castle 25 years ago. However, it has emerged it is
a 17th century stink bomb used to clear rooms during raids.

For
years, experts wrongly-assumed the pot was used to store olive oil. But
when a picture of it was posted on Facebook a Dutch archeologist 
identified it as a 400-year-old 'stankpotten' - a stink bomb.

Causing a stink: The 'bombs' had fuses attached to the and were often filled with substances such as charcoal, sulphur and pepper seeds which exploded when they smashed

With fuses attached to them, these 
bombs were often filled with substances including charcoal, sulphur and 
pepper seeds and exploded as they smashed.

They filled rooms with noxious smells
and smoke, clearing them immediately - exactly the same principle used 
by the SAS when they stormed the Iranian Embassy in 1980.

The bomb - found at Corfe Castle in 
Dorset - dates back to the Civil War, when Cromwell's Parliamentarian 
forces attacked the fortress that was a royalist stronghold.

National Trust worker Nancy Grace uncovered pieces of the relic in 
1986 and painstakingly stuck the parts back together to reveal a six 
inch high, three-handled receptacle.

It was found outside the outer gatehouse at Corfe Castle, that was almost completely destroyed during the war.

Some were used as just incendiary weapons and because they were all destroyed when used very few survived.

This
is the only one known of this design found in the UK, although 
spherical metal versions that look like cartoon bombs have been 
discovered.

Earlier this year the National Trust found funds to send 
some of its finds for identification and the stink bomb was sent to 
Lorraine Mepham at Wessex Archaeology.

She is a member of the Medieval Pottery Research Group and posted a picture of the artefact on the group's Facebook page.

Miss
Grace, who still works for the National Trust, said: 'I found it in 
1986. I stuck it back together and thought it was tableware for storing 
oil or something.

'Experts at the time said it wasn't English and had been imported but we didn't know any more than that.

'Then earlier this year we sent it off to Wessex Archaeology for a finds report.

Some were used as just incendiary weapons but very few survived because they were destroyed once they were launched

'When I got their email I was so excited to find out what it was after all these years.

'It
was found to be a weapon that would have contained any number of 
contents that could catch fire or cause smelly smoke to be emitted.

'It had three fuses attached to the three handles and it would have been thrown.

'I found it outside the guard room where the men who were in charge of the main gate of the castle would have worked.

'As all the pieces were in the same spot and it is clear this was never used, which was lucky really.'Miss Mepham said: 'This was very exciting and the first one I have ever seen.

'When I got it I put it on the Facebook page of the Medieval Pottery Research Group.

'We
have a lot of members and it is used for discussion and where people 
help each other identify sherds and vessels. And I received details of 
what it was.

'It is likely that this was imported, and possibly of 
Dutch origin. They were either used as incendiary devices or as, 
literally, stink bombs.

Ancient form of attack: Experts thought the 'stankpotten' had been used to store olive oil... but its real purpose was far more cunning

'They would have either been thrown into a room to clear it, or from a castle towards those trying to take it.

'The idea was to create noxious, smoky substance that would have cleared an area.

'Research has shown that they would fill these things with anything including charcoal, pepper seeds, sulphur and pitch.

'The fuses would have been lit and it would have exploded on impact.

'It
would have been used in the same way that professionals today clear 
buildings with stun grenades and shows that things haven't changed all 
that much.'

The object will be on display at Corfe Castle from July 22 to July 29.

Corfe Castle was built by William the Conqueror and was bought Sir John Bankes in 1635.

During
the Civil War his wife, Lady Mary Bankes, led the defence of the castle
when it was twice besieged by Parliamentarian forces.

The first 
siege, in 1643, was unsuccessful, but by 1645 Corfe was one of the last 
remaining royalist strongholds in southern England and fell to a siege 
ending in an assault.

In March that year Corfe Castle was demolished on Parliament's orders.

The National Trust took over its running in the 1980s.
