Caterina Alzetta, 19, died after her long hair got caught in the steering wheel

A 19-year-old Italian girl died after her long hair got caught in the steering wheel causing the car to career across the road into oncoming traffic.

Caterina Alzetta and her brother Pietro, 21, had to be cut free from the wreckage and she died later in hospital from her injuries. 

The brother and sister were the children of Michelle Alzetta, who is head of the local ambulance rescue emergency service in the northern Italian town of Montereale Valcellina.

He said: 'Tragically her hair got caught in the steering wheel.

'As we understand it when she made a sudden movement of the head it pulled on the steering wheel.'

Her brother who survived said that the accident had happened after his sister had wound down the window causing her hair to fly about.

It had then got tangled in the steering wheel and when she tried to pull it free, the car had veered.

He said it went into the path of the oncoming traffic and hit a car.

Two men, both brothers aged 42 and 47, were in the other car and were also hospitalised.
