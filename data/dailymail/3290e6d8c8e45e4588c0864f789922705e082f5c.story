Bobbi Kristina Brown has been taken off her ventilator and her breathing tube removed as her condition remains unchanged at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, according to a family source.

USA Today reports that the 21-year-old has been given a tracheotomy to help her continue to breathe. The decision to remove her tube does not mean her family has made a decision about her life support, the source told the newspaper.   

Family on Thursday said Brown's condition is 'still critical' and that the surgical procedure - which opens an airway into the trachea through the neck - was a normal one for coma patients.

'The tracheotomy is a different place for the tube to go,' the source told PEOPLE. 'Everything else remains the same. It's a waiting game. The family is hoping and waiting.' 

According to the source, the procedure will also reduce the risk of infection.

'She is still critical and we don't know what the outcome will be,' the source said. 'No one is giving up on this kid.'

Meanwhile, who that family source is, exactly, remains unclear as Bobbi's father Bobbi Brown claims the relatives who have been giving media interviews about her medical condition do not have direct knowledge of her treatment.

Singer Bobby Brown's attorney asked media outlets on February 13 to stop speaking with family members unauthorized to discuss the condition of his daughter.

She was found face down and unresponsive in a bathtub at her suburban home last month.

'She is still critical and we don't know what the outcome will be,' a family source said. 'No one is giving up on this kid.'

Few details about the aspiring 21-year-old singer's condition have been made public. Family members have said she is fighting for her life.

'We continue to request privacy in this matter,' Bobby Brown said in a statement. 'We thank everyone that supports Bobbi Kristina and God is hearing our prayers.'

Bobby Brown's attorney said the relatives giving interviews about Bobbi Kristina Brown are not in communication with her doctors, and in particular asked media organizations to disregard cousin, Jerod Brown.

The cousin said in an interview with Atlanta TV station WXIA this week that she remained on a ventilator and the family had no plans to remove her from life support.

'This is a criminal investigation and we do not need this side show,' attorney Christopher Brown, who is representing Bobbi Kristina's father, said in a statement.

Jerod Brown was also involved in disputed reports that Nick Gordon, who calls himself the husband of Bobbi Kristina Brown, cannot visit her at the hospital.

Lawyers for Gordon said the cousin's contention that Gordon was pursuing legal action to gain access to Brown was false. They said Gordon, who has kept a low profile since Bobbi Kristina Brown was rushed to a hospital, only wants to see her recover.

'He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon,' lawyers Randy Kessler and Joe Habachy said in a statement on Thursday.

Division: Bob Brown, pictured at the weekend after visiting his daughter, has issued a public denial that Nick Gordon was married to his daughter. He also says the family member giving information to the press is not authorized to do so

'Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.'

Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but Bobby Brown said they never legally married.

Whitney Houston, a six-time Grammy Award-winner who battled substance abuse, drowned in a hotel bathtub in Beverly Hills, California, in February 2012. Authorities said cocaine use and heart disease contributed to her death at age 48.

Police in Roswell, Georgia, are investigating the circumstances leading to Brown's discovery in the tub on January 31.

She had been in a car crash four days earlier, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said.

The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said, and one of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out.

The hole placed in her throat will allow Brown to continue breathing and lower the risk posed from infection, family says
