Commons Speaker John Bercow is planning to stand down after the next Election – paving the way for a sensational return to Parliament by Boris Johnson.

Mr Bercow has told the local Conservative Party association in Buckingham that he will resign as Speaker in the middle of the next Parliament.

It means there will be a by-election in the ultra-safe Tory seat just over a year after Mr Johnson completes his second term as London Mayor.

Transition: Sources have confirmed that Boris Johnson is being lined up to take Commons Speaker John Bercow's Buckingham seat during the next election

High-level sources have told The Mail on Sunday Boris is already being identified by local party grandees as Mr Bercow’s ideal successor – and that the Speaker is ‘privately inclined’ to be ‘helpful’ to the Mayor. They added the constituency would select Mr Johnson ‘in about ten seconds flat’.

The news is likely to be greeted with groans in No 10, which had hoped that the Boris leadership bandwagon was running out of steam.

Mr Johnson recently reassured David Cameron’s circle that he will not seek to return to the  Commons in a by-election before 2015, and nor would he stand in that year’s General Election.

But the No 10 aides were left with the impression he would start plotting his Westminster comeback shortly afterwards.

Mr Bercow’s decision stems from a promise, made to the constituency association when he became Speaker in 2009, that he would serve a maximum of nine years before stepping down and allowing a return to ‘normal politics’ in Buckingham.

By tradition, a Commons Speaker stands for Parliament as an independent and is unopposed by the main parties.

Last night, the Speaker’s office confirmed Mr Bercow’s pledge, meaning Mr Johnson could be campaigning on the stump in Buckingham by the end of 2017.

True blue: Buckingham is a rock solid Tory seat which had a whopping 18,000 Conservative majority last time it was openly contested

It is a plum seat. At the last openly contested Election in 2005, Mr Bercow won with a whopping majority of more than 18,000. It is an hour’s drive from London, where Mr Johnson has his family home, and directly adjacent to his former Henley constituency.

Mr Johnson, whose ambition to become party leader and Prime Minister remains undimmed, is reluctant to serve for an extended period under Mr Cameron. Boris aides now suggest that the master plan is for him to serve out his full Mayoral term until May 2016, enabling him to keep the ‘solemn vow’ he made to Londoners to not combine the mayoralty with ‘any other political capacity’.

He would then spend 12 to 18 months building up a campaign war chest, through writing, public speaking and media appearances, before standing in a rock-solid seat.

By that point, his advisers expect Mr Cameron to either be struggling with a small Tory majority or confined to a second term of Coalition – or to have resigned after losing narrowly to Ed Miliband in 2015. Until now, it had been expected that Boris would return to the Commons by persuading a ‘stooge’ MP to stand aside for him. Mr Bercow’s plans remove that need.

Last night, a Commons source said: ‘John has organised his  personal life around this pledge, but only a few people in the know have realised. He will publicly reiterate it in his 2015 “manifesto” for Buckingham.

‘It means it is one of the longest-signalled by-elections in recent political history. He and Boris get on well, so John would be inclined to be helpful in terms of the precise timing of his departure.’   

The source added: ‘The activists in his patch are keen on the idea.’

A spokesman for Mr Bercow said: ‘Mr Speaker has previously indicated he wouldn’t expect to do more than nine years’. He added that Mr Bercow and Mr Johnson had not discussed the issue.  

Buckingham Conservative Association declined to comment. Mr Johnson’s office did not respond to messages.
