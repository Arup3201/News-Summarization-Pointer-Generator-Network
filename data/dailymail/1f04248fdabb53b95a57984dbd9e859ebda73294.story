The internet could have been known as the catenet if an early web pioneer had got his way.

In 1974, French engineer Louis Pouzin designed one of the first packet-switching technologies, which breaks down data into smaller 'packets' and send this information in parts wirelessly between computers.

He called it the catenet - pronounced cat-en-et - and it was a precursor to what finally became the internet we use today.

A French engineer who created one of the earliest precursors to the modern-day internet wanted the network to be called catenet. Although the term is now obsolete, his work into packet-switching technology that sends information wirelessly inspired some of the technologies used today

Packet-switching - This technology breaks down digital data, such as photos or emails for example, into smaller 'packets'. These packets are sent over networks, wirelessly between computers and information processing devices. The data is then reassembled at the other end. 

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) - TCP/IP are the protocols used with packet-switching technologies on the modern-day internet. They format the packets - depending on 
how and where they're being sent - transmits them from one decide how this data is received by a second device.

Local area network -  LAN networks connect computers within a limited area such as a home and office.

Catenet - The term used for a packet-switching network coined by pioneer and creator Louis Pouzin in 1974. It was a precursor for the internet.

Arpanet - The world's first operational network to send packets over networks and the first to implement TCP/IP, which replaced its original protocols.

Pouzin coined the phrase in a paper called A Proposal for Interconnecting Packet Switching Networks that he presented to Brunel University in London.

Pouzin founded the Cyclades packet-switching network in the early 1970s. 

At this time the word 'network' meant what is now referred to as a local area network (LAN).

This meant it was a network that connected computers within a limited area such as a home and office.

It did not extend outside of this area, in the way the modern-day internet networks can.

Pouzin's catenet network was the concept of linking these networks into a 'network of networks' that could give devices different addresses.

It was created at a similar to time to the Arpanet packet-switching network that was the world's first operational network to send data packets.

Arpanet became the first to adopt Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which later became part of the framework for the modern-day internet. 

One of the limitations of the catenet network was that data was not always received in the same way that it was sent.

Pouzin also did not implement the TCP/IP suite.

The world's first operational packet-switching network was Arpanet. This map details the processes early versions of the network used. Arpanet was the first to implement TCP/IP which is still used in the modern-day internet. Catenet didn't adopt these protocols and became obsolete

The TCP/IP suite gives 'end-to-end' connectivity that specifies exactly how data packets should be formatted - depending on how and where they're being sent.

The packets are then addressed, transmitted by the first computer or processing device and TCP/IP controls how the data is received by a second device. 

These protocols replaced earlier protocols presented by catenet as well as Arpanet because it was a much more efficient way of sending information.

This became the basis for the internetwork, which was later shortened to internet, and led to the catenet term becoming obsolete.
