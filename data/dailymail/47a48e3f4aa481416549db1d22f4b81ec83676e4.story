The teenage sweethearts in the midst of a dramatic crime spree across five southern states have been spotted begging on the streets in Florida, police said.

Dalton Hayes, 18, and his 13-year-old girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, fled their Kentucky home two weeks ago and have evaded the law to apparently make it at least 600 miles south.

Along the way they have allegedly stolen three pickup trucks and two handguns - and police now say they have lost patience with the pair.

'Crime spree': Dalton Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, are seen on surveillance footage inside a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina on Monday. The young couple has been missing from Kentucky for two weeks

Speaking Friday, the sheriff in their home of Grayson County, Kentucky, described their behavior as 'increasingly brazen and dangerous', and told them to surrender immediately.

Norman Chaffins said: 'There's going to come a time when we're not going to see him as an 18-year-old kid.

'We're going to see him as someone who's stolen three vehicles with two handguns in them, and the outcome is not going to be good for either one of them if they don't turn themselves in.'

It came after police in Florida told NBC News that the two had made their way into the state, after blazing a trail through Kentucky, Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.

They did not say which town they had been seen in - reportedly to avoid tipping the runaways off. 

Hayes's mother said the pair have not been dating long, but are in love. She has also said Phillips portrayed herself as being 19 years old, and that everybody, including her son, believed her.

Runaways: Phillips, left, and Hayes, 18, were last seen in Kentucky on January 4 after his mother confronted the girl about her age. Before then, she thought the girl was 19, she said

Rebels: Hayes' mother said her son also believed that 13-year-old Cheyenne was 19

Describing the girl's behavior, Tammy Martin said she 'would go in and write checks, and she would come out with cigarettes and stuff, so I didn't have any reason not to believe she wasn't 19.'

Speaking Friday, she urged her son to give up and 'face the consequences'.

She said: 'I pretty much cry myself to sleep every night worrying about where they are and if a police officer or any random individual tries to pull them over and isn't so nice and hurts them,'. 

When he hit the road, Hayes was running away from trouble back home. He faces burglary and theft charges in his home county, stemming from an arrest late last year.

Their crimes, which authorities say include the alleged vehicle thefts, trespassing and forging checks to get cash, are increasingly worrying.

'Victims': Kathy and Jim McGrew said they arrived home on Sunday to find the teens stealing their truck

Damage: After taking chase with the help of police, they found the damaged truck, pictured, in nearby woods

Chaffins said: 'They're going on people's property, they're forging checks to get money. ... They could have stopped in Kentucky, but they didn't."

Since they have no source of money, he added, 'they're going to get desperate.'

Before they left Kentucky, the teens dodged officers there twice. Police said they crashed the first truck they stole and hid in the woods, then later stole another truck nearby. 

The two were spotted Monday at a Walmart in South Carolina, where the teens are thought to have passed two stolen checks. According to police there, they were driving a car stolen from Kentucky.

'Plot': The teenagers allegedly used two forged checks to get cash back from the cashier at Walmart

Escape: The couple left in this 2006 Toyota Tacoma, which was later found dumped in Georgia

Authorities believe they then headed to Georgia and stole a pickup truck from the driveway of a man's home in Henry County, 30 miles southeast of Atlanta.

He awoke Wednesday to find his vehicle was gone, along with two handguns he kept inside, Henry County police said Friday.

Hours later, another truck the couple is suspected of having stolen in another state was found nearby. It had been crashed through a fence and abandoned behind a vacant building on neighboring property.

Have you seen them? The young couple continue to elude authorities; if you see them, call 911

Martin said her son texted her a few days after their disappearance to say the couple was in Mississippi. They were spotted soon after that in Kentucky, she said.

'He was just trying to throw me off,' she said. 'I'm sure he thought that I would call the police and tell them where he was.'

Chaffins said the situation is getting more serious as time passes.

He said: 'This is not a game to us. Our biggest fear is that Dalton is not going to stop for the police. He's going to run every time they approach him.'
