Dead at 32: Former NRL star Ryan Tandy had been banned from the game for life

The NSW Coroners Court told the MailOnline no decision has yet been made whether to conduct an inquest into Tandy's death to determine whether he died of a drugs overdose. Police said the death is not being treated as suspicious.

Tributes have poured in from throughout Australia for the 32-year-old, who played for the Canterbury Bulldogs and for the Melbourne Storm, and from Ireland and Hull where he was also being remembered by former team mates as a 'larger than life' character.

A statement from Rugby League Ireland, for whom Tandy played in the 2008 World Cup, said:  â€˜Rugby League Ireland would like to pass on our condolences to the family and friends of Ryan Tandy.

â€˜Ryan was a larger than life character and we would like to express our thanks for the commitment during the World Cup.'

'Ryan served Hull Kingston Rovers with distinction during his time with the club and our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this difficult time.'

'It's important that people know who the real Ryan Tandy was ... he was a generous man with his time,' Tandy's former coach Keiran Dempsey told Triple M.

Tandy was due back in court next month over the plot, linked to criminal bikie organisations, which allegedly was an attempt to recover a drug debt worth tens of thousands of dollars.

The troubled star had received a life ban from rugby league after he was convicted of match fixing while playing for the Canterbury Bulldogs against North Queensland Cowboys in 2010.

Investigations were launched following a $30,000 betting plunge on the game and Tandy was subsequently banned for life from NRL.

He was also handed a $4,000 fine and a 12-month good behaviour bond for his involvement in the scandal.

Over the course of his tumultuous career, Tandy featured in 36 NRL games across five clubs.

Born in Wollongong in 1981, he began playing for St George Illawarra in 2003 before joining South Sydney midway through that season.

'In complete shock!!! Won a premiership with Ryan in 2009, a bloke who gave his all on the footy field. RIP,' he added.

Tandy's former South Sydney teammate Bryan Fletcher told The Daily Telegraph: 'I wouldnâ€™t have seen this coming. It's tragic for his family.'

Fletcher revealed he had spoken with Tandy only a month ago.

During their meeting, Tandy told of how he was planning a new compression garments business.

'He'd been training and was off the drink. He was in a good headspace which I thought was good,' a shocked Fletcher added.

Tandy's friend Brett Clarke wrote on Twitter: 'Today I've lost a good mate, a bloke I've shared the best and funniest days of my life with. Ryan Tandy you'll be missed mate. #RIP'.

Sydney Roosters star James Maloney commented: 'Cant believe the news on Ryan Tandy, a bloke I shared some good times with... RIP mate!!!'

The official Twitter account of the Australian National Rugby League posted a tribute that said: 'Saddened to hear of Ryan Tandy's death. Our thoughts and condolences are with his family.'

As well as his new business venture, Tandy had been excited about the release of his book, The Fix, written with Sydney journalist Josh Massoud about the footballer's role in Australian rugby league's most notorious match-fixing scandal.

Book publishing house, Allen & Unwin, describes Ryan Tandy's arrest, his subsequent very public fall from grace and his treatment by police and the football establishment.

'Sacked by his club, arrested, charged and convicted for attempting to fix the game, Tandy became the most recognised and despised figure in Australian sport,' Allen & Unwin wrote.

'Behind the headlines, little is known about Tandy, the shadowy dealings that went into the now notorious fix, or the police investigation that claimed his scalp.'
