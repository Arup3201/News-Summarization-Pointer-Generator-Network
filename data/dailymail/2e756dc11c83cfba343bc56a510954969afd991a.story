Compilations now account for 21 per cent of all albums sold

With millions of tracks available to download in seconds, many feared digital music would kill the compilation album. But after a decade of decline, it is making a comeback.

Compilations, typically a mix of chart hits covering all genres of music, now account for 21 per cent of all albums sold.

Figures from the Official Charts Company show sales of compilation albums jumped 7.2 per cent in 2012 to 20.6million, compared to 19.2million in 2011.

It reverses a trend which saw compilation sales decline after 2004, when iTunes was launched in the UK.

The
albums are becoming increasingly popular in the digital downloads 
market. The most popular include the Now That’s What I Call Music 
series.

Last week, the 
second most popular compilation album was Eddie Stobart – Trucking 
Songs, which includes hits from Queen, Meatloaf and ZZ Top.

It is expected to reach the number one spot this week.

Last year, 26 titles sold more than 100,000 copies, up from 18 the year before.

Other popular releases include dance compilations – which made up 25 percent of all those sold – as well as more eclectic one-off compilations such as the Olympics opening ceremony album, Isles Of Wonder.

Paul Williams, Head of Business Analysis
at Music Week, said: ‘Some predicted digital music stores like iTunes, 
where millions of individual tracks are available, would kill the 
compilation because fans could now create their own collections of hits.

'A revival in compilation sales shows the exact opposite has occurred.

‘However,
in the download market’s early years, demand did fall dramatically and 
this could be because compilations are often bought by more casual music
fans who are also slower to adopt new formats and technologies.

These same fans are finally going digital, but still need a ‘trusted guide’ of a compilation album to know what to buy rather than getting lost among the millions of track choices.

Geoff Taylor of the British Phonographic Industry added: ‘Despite the availability of tracks as individual downloads, compilations – led by the Now series – are confounding expectations and performing better than ever.

‘Not only are music fans getting superb value from double and triple album titles brimming with hits, but a string of newly-themed albums have established themselves over the last year.’
