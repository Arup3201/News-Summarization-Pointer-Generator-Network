By SAM TAYLOR FOR THE DAILY MAIL  

According to the fairy tale, the test of a true princess was whether she could detect a pea hidden beneath a pile of 20 mattresses and eiderdowns. Today, peas are out and thread counts are in. The higher the better.

But what does it really mean? Technically, the term ‘thread count’ refers to the number of threads woven together in one square inch of fabric. Manufacturers count them both horizontally and vertically across this little square. The idea is, the more threads they cram in, the more luxurious the sheet.

Yet, this is not always an exact indicator of quality. Some manufacturers ‘cheat’ by counting the strands that make up an individual thread as additional threads, meaning a thread count of 600 might really be just 300, low-quality double-ply threads.

Sam Taylor (pictured) puts all the different bed linens to the test to see whether a higher thread count really does make a difference 

Other factors include finish and tightness of weave. For example, sateen is cotton yarn woven like satin for a lustrous sheen, while percale is a closely woven thread-count of more than 200.

Sam Taylor tests what the High Street has to offer...

LIKE FLOATING ON SILK

John Lewis: Genuisa cotton double fitted sheet, 100 per cent cotton, 1,000 thread sateen, £110

I grew up with a mother reared on rationing and devoted to keeping things for ‘best’: crockery, cutlery, glasses, tablecloths and bed linen, the ‘best’ cupboard was packed with things that were put away and never used. This sheet would certainly have been consigned to her Aladdin’s cave.

The packaging describes Geniusa as offering fibres that are longer and finer than anything else. Without an industrial strength magnifying glass, it is impossible to tell, but certainly the sateen cotton feels thick and sumptuous — and you can’t see the mattress cover through it. The elasticated corners are generous, which means no stretching and the pillowcases are like resting on silk. 5/5

SLEEK AND NO IRONING!

M&S: Supima cotton double fitted sheet, 100 per cent cotton,

600 thread sateen, £70

If you have children in the house, oversleeping is something that happens to other people. But this sheet could shake things up a bit.

Sam Taylor (pictured) rated the M&S: Supima cotton double fitted sheet at 4/5, praising it for it's impressive non-iron finish 

The packaging claims it will deliver the perfect night’s sleep — and it certainly does. Getting out of bed was very difficult and I dreamt of going back to it even more than I usually do. Once on, the sheet looks impressive and having a non-iron finish just adds to its appeal. It also has the added benefit of a 10 in overhang on the edges — which means no nasty gaps on the side, even on a deep-filled mattress. 4/5

A LITTLE BIT ITCHY AND SCRATCHY

Primark Home: Basic flat double sheet, 50 per cent cotton, 50 per cent polyester

No thread count, £8

When polyester was first invented in the Forties, it was heralded as a miracle fibre. There was little it couldn’t do — except convince us that it was a luxury item. It was always a bit scratchy and it still is.

Primark’s 50/50 cotton and polyester mix is almost transparently thin. No matter which way I lay, it made me itch and overheat, an unwanted extra for the menopausal woman.

That said, the manufacturers made no claims for its slumber properties or its deluxe appeal. It is a sheet. Or more accurately, a dust sheet. But at little more than the price of a couple of cappuccinos, it seems churlish to complain. 2/5

FIT FOR A QUEEN

Dorma: Fitted double sheet, 100 per cent cotton sateen,

350 thread count, £23.99

Sheet makers to the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Dorma simply don’t make sheets that are below 200 thread. Since 1921, they have been producing top-drawer bed linen and pride themselves on giving you that extra edge over the neighbours on the washing line.

Sam says the Dorma: Fitted double sheet is fit for a Queen and allows coverage for even the deepest mattress

The 350 thread, double sheet is one of their biggest sellers. It’s not difficult to see why.

Part of their indulgent range of luxury bedding, it is fit for a Queen who has never knowingly wasted money. It is 14in deep which allows for coverage of even the deepest mattress, perhaps even two mattresses, and the pillowcases are as crisp after five nights as they are after one. 4/5

SHINY AND VERY SLIPPERY

The White Company: Brompton flat double sheet, 100 per cent cotton,

300 thread sateen, £68

Coloured bits around the borders of sheets and pillowcases have always made me anxious and the silver streaks that define the Brompton collection fall into that category.

Like most of the sheets I was testing, it has a sateen finish, but set against the almost neon finish white dye used on this range, it gives it a reflective quality that makes the bed look like something off Star Trek.

In fact, so shiny is it that it works like a mirrored ceiling in reverse. The experience of sleeping was so slippery that at some point in the night I subconsciously started holding on to the edge of the bed. 3/5

COSTS MORE THAN A FLIGHT TO PARIS

House of Fraser: Luxury Hotel Collection single fitted sheet, 100 per cent cotton, 500 thread sateen, £140

All daughters believe they are princesses and mine is no exception, so the chance to upgrade her single bed linen to something that costs more than a flight to Paris was very appealing.

Sam says although the £140 sheets from House of Fraser: Luxury Hotel Collection are luxurious they're not quite worth the money

I approached this test with the question of wondering quite who would spend this amount of money on a single sheet. In fact, who would spent this amount on any sheet?

True, it does deliver a relaxed and warm night’s slumber as the cotton is very dense, which makes it feel toasty. It’s luxurious, but I think I’d rather wait for the sale. 3/5

PERFECT FOR PICKY MOTHER-IN-LAWS

John Lewis: Cotton and Percale, 100 per cent Egyptian cotton, 400 thread count, £40

The guest room often gets overlooked on the bed linen department. When VIP guests go to stay in the White House, the sheets are ironed six times before being put on the bed.

This doesn’t happen in our home, which is probably why we don’t have many VIP visitors.

The matt finish of the John Lewis: Cotton and Percale gives a classy look and feel, making it seem more expensive than it is 

However, this sheet could change all that. The percale weave gives it a matt finish, which immediately makes it look and feel very classy — more like an expensive linen than a mid-market cotton.

The ivory colouring is very flattering against the skin; past 50 everything helps. And it gives the illusion you have thought about the picky relatives, even if you can’t wait for them to leave. 4/5

STUDENT-PROOF

Tesco: Double fitted sheet, 100 per cent Egyptian cotton, 200 thread count, £12

The majority of us will spend a third of our lives asleep — if you discount some students who notch up another three years in a virtual coma.

They leave home with a bag full of freshly laundered towels and sheets and return a couple of months later with a putrid, foul-smelling laundry bag no detergent can bring to heel. So why waste money on them?

This sheet is comfortable, the cotton isn’t too thin and it promises longer lasting durability. It also requires minimal ironing and suggests that it can be washed at lower temperatures unless it is dirty. Which of course, it will be. 3/5

BEST-KEPT BOUDOIR SECRET

Primark Home: Luxury double fitted sheet, 100 per cent cotton, 200 thread count, £9.50

I have to confess that I had never been to Primark before taking this test. What have I been doing with my life? 

No wonder I have no money. Where they failed miserably on their mixed cotton and polyester sheet, Primark Home have won the crown with this luxury (for them) offering. It’s a plain, white, soft, matt finish, generously cut, fitted sheet that could hold its own in the smartest houses.

Yes, it’s a mere 200 thread, but who’s counting? It’s £9.50 and it feels like ten times that price. Even my husband, Mark, noticed the difference and this is a man who prides himself on once failing to spot that I had a leg in plaster. 5/5
