A woman who was left humiliated after discovering she was too fat to fit into her wedding dress is now half the woman she was -  after losing eight stone.

Having found the  dress of her dreams, Vicky Jennings, 28, from Newton Abbot in Devon, was looking forward to marrying her sweetheart, Dom.

But just a week before the wedding, she discovered she had gained so much weight, she struggled to fit into her dress - and was left mortified.

Vicky Jennings was so mortified by her struggle to squeeze into her wedding dress, she went on to shed 8st

'It was the week before my wedding when I went for the final fitting,' she explained. 'There were about six to eight weeks between all of the fittings and up until that point it had fitted.

'Yet on that final fitting the zip just wouldn't go any higher.'

Dom and 'fat and frumpy' Vicky Jennings celebrate their wedding day

The dress was hastily let out by one inch on each side to ensure Mrs Jennings could marry in comfort.

'I had to have it taken out an inch either side, so two inches in total,' said the mother-of-two.

'The dress was already a size 20, which annoyed me anyway since I didn't believe that I was that size at all, so when they had to let it out, it was absolutely horrifying. I was mortified.'

As a result, Mrs Jennings said that while most brides feel on top of the world, she walked down the aisle feeling 'fat and frumpy'.

Resolving to ditch her favourite takeaway foods, chocolate and kebabs which had helped her  creep up to 16st, she pledged to lose the weight for good.

'As I got comfortable in the relationship I stopped worrying about my weight and before long the pounds piled on,' she said

'I knew I had to do something after my wedding dress needed to be let out, but I couldn't face another crash diet that only worked for a week and left me feeling hungry.'

Mrs Jennings then began her battle to beat the bulge with the help of Slimming World.

She had originally piled on the pounds by eating five takeaways a week and drinking up to five cans of cola a day.

'The problem was that we didn't really cook at home. It just got to the point where we would rely on frozen meals and takeaways,' she said.

'We'd probably have five takeaways a week. My favourite food was doner kebabs. I'd have one a week.

'I also lived on cola, I'd have four or five cans of it a day. I just didn't realise how bad for you it was.'

After joining her local Slimming World group, she learned how to cook healthy, fat-free meals.

She has cut out the takeaways and the family now enjoys healthy home-cooked meals using fresh ingredients every night.  

Now the super-slimmer is a trim 8st having shed exactly half of her previous body weight in just 12 months.

The couple beam as they raise a toast at their wedding - but Vicky said she felt 'fat and frumpy' on her big day

'It is fair to say two of me could fit into that dress now,' said a delighted Mrs Jennings, who lives with Dom in Newton Abbot, Devon.

'When I look at my wedding pictures now it feels very odd. I don't remember being like that.

'I am a completely different person now.

I have changed so much and feel a lot more confident. 

It has been quite easy to keep the weight off. I have changed my lifestyle completely

'As my full time job is working as a Slimming World consultant, I would have felt a bit of a fraud not keeping it off!' 

Since losing the weight, Mrs Jennings says she has now got more energy to run around after her two children, six-year-old Liam and Amelia, three.

'It has improved my family life immeasurably - especially with the kids,' she said.

'We have just got a puppy called Bertie, who we take out walking, and I'm able to do so much more with the kids.' 

'I look forward to summer now and wearing size 10 clothes,' she added. 'I never thought I would even enter a gym, let alone enjoy personal training sessions.'
