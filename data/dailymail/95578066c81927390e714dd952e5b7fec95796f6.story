With a combined weight of more than three quarters of a ton - Boris and Marjorie like nothing better than spending their days with their snouts in the trough.

But somehow the pigs - thought to be Britain's fattest breeding pair - still manage to find time for love, producing more than 70 piglets between them at Chyvarloe Farm, near Helston, Cornwall during the last two years.

At 925lbs, Boris is so heavy he can 
easily crush an average-sized female during mating - but Marjorie is big enough to 
bear his enormous bulk.

Porkers: Farmer Paul Parfitt with his pigs Boris (right) and Marjorie at Chyvarloe Farm in Helston, Cornwall. The porkers have a combined weight of three quarters of a ton

Huge: Two-year-old Hettie Parfitt feeds Boris an apple. He and Marjorie have produced an astonishing 70 piglets together

Size: Mr Parfitt reckons Boris and Marjorie are the heaviest breeding couple in the country

The crossbreed Gloucester Old Spot/Large White pigs are so big they could be made into around 10,000 sausages.

Boris is around six times bigger than the slaughter weight of the average pig. He is carrying an estimated 112lbs of bacon, which equates to around 3360 
thin rashers of back and streaky bacon. He could also produce a whopping
54lbs of chops, 72lbs of ham and 32lbs of shoulder.

Master butcher Darren Law, of D.T. Law
Butchers said: 'I reckon you'd get about 600 good, thick rashers of 
back bacon from the loin. It's a bloody big pig.'

Proud owner Paul Parfitt, 37, said: 'Boris is exceptionally fertile. All the lady pigs dote on him.'

'The main problem we have is finding any big enough to avoid getting crushed - but because Marjorie is a beefy pig, she can stomach his weight when they're rutting. Marjorie is Boris' favourite - they've probably had around 70 piglets together.'

Boris stays in peak physical condition by scoffing four kilos of rolled barley and wheat per day.Â 

'Boris is a huge but healthy pig,' 
said Mr Parfitt, who runs the show farm with his wife Charlotte, 29. 'He
hasn't grown this big by eating scraps or junk. His diet is basically a
massive amount of muesli every day plus the odd apple for a treat.'

Sausages: The pigs weigh enough together to make more than 10,000 sausages. Marjorie, weighs about 670lbs, but four-year-old Boris tips the scales at a whopping 925lbs

Hefty: Believe it or not Boris has been on a diet over the winter - but he will soon put the bulk back on when he is allowed back into the fields

Marjorie is one of eight breeding 
sows at the farm with whom lucky Boris sires a staggering 175 piglets every 
year - around 600 in total.

Mr Parfitt said Boris 'never throws his 
weight around,' despite his giant size. 'He's the most docile, laid back
pig you'll ever meet and he'll happily let 100 school children line up 
and stroke him,' he said.

Four-year-old Boris tips the scales at
925lbs, measures more than 7ft from snout to tail, and is well over 3ft
tall. Marjorie, aged three, weighs about 670lbs and is 6ft long and 3ft
6ins tall.

Mr Parfitt said: 'Boris has been on a bit of a diet over the winter - he's been inside so he loses weight, but in the summer he'll put it all back on once he's out in the fields.

'If we weren't to restrict his diet, he'd just get fat, but in the summer, he builds up a lot of muscle. I've heard of pigs that weigh more than 450kg, but I reckon Boris is the podgiest porker in Britain.'

Snuggling: The super-sized pair's bulk has not got in the way of their breeding. Boris has sired 175 piglets with the farm's eight breeding sows

Large scale: The crossbred pair are far larger and heavier than average-sized pigs. Boris alone is four times the size of a normal porker

Paul and Charlotte have grown so attached to Boris that he has been saved from the chop.

Their initial aim was to buy a few pigs to fatten up and sell on - but they never expected Boris to keep expanding until he was nearly four times heavier than a normal hog.

Local butcher Dean Orr reckons Boris alone contains enough meat to make 6,250 sausages - but Paul says his prize pet will never get the chop.

He added: 'I remember him as a little piglet. It was only the fact that he developed into such a phenomenal size that we thought we would keep him for breeding.'
