Yaya Toure has again thrown his future into doubt by claiming he doesn't know if he will still be a Manchester City player next season.

But manager Manuel Pellegrini was quick to dismiss talk of a transfer at a press conference on Friday, insisting the 31-year-old was fully committed to the club. 

The current African Player of the Year joined the Premier League champions from Barcelona back in 2010 and has enjoyed considerable success at the Etihad Stadium.

But over the last year the relationship between player and club has appeared strained, with the Ivorian reportedly unhappy by City's forgetfulness with regards to his birthday.

And while that incident was dismissed by all involved, Toure has again made some telling remarks regarding his situation.

When asked by CNN if he wanted to stay at the club, he said: 'That's a big question and that's an easy question as well, and you have an easy answer... we'll see.

'I don't know (if I'll stay). I'm at City. City is a great club where I've achieved lots of things.'

Toure endured a difficult year off the pitch after his brother Ibrahim tragically died and the Ivorian said that, despite his success with the club, 2014 had been 'a horrible year'.
