It is an age-old saying that is regularly contested by brunettes all over the world.

But it seems blondes do indeed have more fun. So much more, in fact, that their careers are now suffering.

Britain's leading facial mapping team 
has revealed just how important looks are when it comes to success in 
the workplace, and it seems having fair hair doesn't actually fare all 
that well.

Blondes have too much fun: Fair-haired ladies such as Holly Willoughby, left, and Mollie King, right, are less likely to succeed at work, according to the new study

Brunette success: Women with straight dark hair like Kim Kardashian, left, and Pippa Middleton, right, are destined for more success in the workplace, according to new research

The research team, led by the UK's leading facial mapping expert Dr Chris Solomon, was tasked with analysing the facial features we associate with success and leadership in the workplace, and the results found that those with straight dark hair are considered most likely to succeed.

Respondents ranked faces in terms of perceived business acumen and leadership qualities, taking into account a range of facial features such as the shape, size and position of the head, eyes, lips and overall symmetry.

The findings revealed that the shape 
of the male jaw line is a key metric when it comes to perceived 
leadership qualities; indeed we associate 'hyper' leaders with having a 
very strong jaw line.

Conversely, faces which get narrower 
towards the jaw line were perceived as weaker and less credible.

Face for success: The research found that David Cameron, left, and Nick Clegg, right, have a perfect face for success

Interestingly, Steve Jobs and Peter Jones were cited as business leaders who fit the leader profile, and David Cameron and Nick Clegg most closely match the 'leadership at work' prototypes. 

Future leadership hopeful and current Major of London Boris Johnson scored lower for his down-turned eyes and fleshy jawline.

For Boris, however, the face for success is not 
too far out of reach. Based on average UK plastic surgery prices, the 
London Mayor would need to spend £11,847 on plastic surgery to fit the 
hyper-leader model.

Ed Milliband, meanwhile, may want to consider removing the dark rings under his eyes which are associated with unsuccessful people in the workplace.

But Ed's facial-altering work might be a little more costly: experts estimate that he would have to part 
with £13,869, which would include rhinoplasty surgery (nose shaping), a 
chin implant, eye lid bag removal surgery and a brow lift to improve his
physical hyper-leader qualities.

Work needed: It seems that Ed Milliband, left, and Boris Johnson, right, need some extra work done if they want to progress in their political career

Steve North, General Manager of TV channel Dave who commissioned the research, said: 'We all know that first impressions count but this is the first time that a study has actually delved into the facial traits that help us make those decisions. 

'The results are fascinating and make for depressing reading for the likes of Ed Milliband and Boris Johnson who may want to consider a little cosmetic work before their next election campaigns.’

The study was carried out to celebrate the start of the second series of Suits, on Dave, Thursdays 9pm
