A California man was forced off a cross-country flight in Denver after allegedly groping multiple women seated near him.

Gregory Meyer, 47, of Studio City, CA, was arrested Friday after his boorish behaviour turned lewd, causing the plane to make a pit stop at Denver International Airport, in Colorado. Meyer is alleged to have fondled two female passengers.

When refused service from flight attendants because he was 'visibly drunk,' Meyer broke out his own bottle of vodka, according to an announcement from the US Attorney’s office in Denver.

Not so lucky: Gregory Meyer's luck appears to have run out after his flight was diverted and he was arrested

The flight, from Burbank Bob Hope Airport to John F Kennedy International Airport in New York, was diverted to Denver when pilots decided to eject him after flight attendants complained of his ‘assaultive behaviour.’

The last entry on Meyer's Facebook page was him checking in to Bob Hope Airport saying 'Here we go.'

Smelling of alcohol when he boarded the flight, Meyer is alleged to have stroked a female passenger’s arm, grabbed her waist and tried to grab her hand. The startled woman was sitting next to the purported pervert, but across the aisle.

Rebuffed by the first object of his drunken desire, Meyer then allegedly grabbed the head of a female passenger seated in front of him. Meyer then supposedly refused to follow the requests of flight attendants, causing the pilot to land the plane.

During further questioning, investigators discovered that Meyer had also taken an Ambien sleeping pill, it is not clear if he had a prescription for the medication.

Meyer was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, placed into federal custody and arraigned Friday on two charges of simple assault, each charge carries a maximum 6-month prison sentence and a $5,000 fine.

It is not known if Meyer, originally from New York, continued on with his trip or returned home to California. Meyer's Facebook page says he is the owner of Meyer Consulting.
