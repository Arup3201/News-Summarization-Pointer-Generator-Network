A cosmic 'pile-up' between four galaxy clusters that has taken place over 350million years has been pieced together by scientists.

The investigation into how Abell 2744 - nicknamed Pandora's Cluster - came to be formed is likely to provide researchers with significant insights into the nature of dark matter.

They pieced together the cluster's complex and violent history using telescopes in space and on the ground, including ESO’s Very Large Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope.

Abell 2744: A cosmic collision between four galaxy clusters that has taken place over 350million years has been pieced together by scientists

Lead researcher Julian Merten said: 
'Like a crash investigator piecing together the cause of an accident, we
can use observations of these cosmic pile-ups to reconstruct events 
that happened over a period of hundreds of millions of years.

'This can reveal how structures form 
in the Universe, and how different types of matter interact with each 
other when they are smashed together.'

Abell 2744 is the result of a 
simultaneous collision of at least four separate galaxy clusters and 
this complex collision has produced strange effects that have never been
seen together before.

When huge clusters of galaxies crash together, the resulting mess is a treasure trove of information for astronomers. 

Researcher Renato Dupke said: 'We 
nicknamed it Pandora's Cluster because so many different and strange 
phenomena were unleashed by the collision. Some of these phenomena had 
never been seen before.'

Among these is a 'bullet' near the core of the cluster, where the gas of one cluster collided with that of another to 
create a shock wave. The dark matter passed through the collision 
unaffected.

In another part of the cluster there 
seem to be galaxies and dark matter, but no hot gas. The gas may have 
been stripped away during the collision, leaving behind no more than a 
faint trail.

Even odder features lie in the outer 
parts of the cluster. One region contains lots of dark matter, but no 
luminous galaxies or hot gas. A separate ghostly clump of gas has been 
ejected, which precedes rather than follows the associated dark matter.

This puzzling arrangement may be 
telling astronomers something about how dark matter behaves and how the 
various ingredients of the Universe interact with each other.

The scientists have made an animation
that reconstructs how the remarkable merger event that created Abell 
2944 might have happened.

In the video, the red regions are 
clouds of very hot gas, detected by their X-ray emission; the blue 
clouds are regions rich in dark matter that can only be discovered 
indirectly by their gravitational influence.

It shows how these different 
components behaved over a period of several million years, leading up to
their currently observed positions.

Abell 2744 was studied in more detail
than ever before by combining data from the European Southern 
Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), the Japanese Subaru telescope,
the Nasa/Eureopean Space Agency Hubble Space Telescope, and Nasa's 
Chandra X-Ray Observatory.
The galaxies in the cluster are clearly visible in the VLT and Hubble images.

Although the galaxies are bright they
make up less than 5 per cent of the mass there. The rest, around 20 per
cent, is gas, which is so hot that it shines only in X-rays, and dark 
matter, around 75 per cent, which is completely invisible.

To understand what was going on in the collision the team mapped the positions of all three types of matter in Abell 2744.

Dark matter is particularly elusive 
as it does not emit, absorb or reflect light, but only makes itself 
apparent through its gravitational attraction.

To pinpoint the location of this 
mysterious substance the team exploited a phenomenon known as 
gravitational lensing. This is the bending of light rays from distant 
galaxies as they pass through the gravitational fields present in the 
cluster.

The result is a series of tell-tale distortions in the images of galaxies in the background of the VLT and Hubble observations.

By carefully plotting the way that 
these images are distorted, it is possible to map quite accurately where
the hidden mass - and hence the dark matter - actually lies.

By comparison, finding the hot gas in
the cluster is simpler as Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory can observe 
it directly. These observations are not just crucial to find out where 
the gas is, but also to show the angles and speeds at which different 
components of the cluster came together.

It seems that the complex collision 
has separated out some of the hot gas and dark matter so that they now 
lie apart from each other, and from the visible galaxies.

Galaxy clusters are the biggest 
structures in the cosmos, containing literally trillions of stars. The 
way they form and develop through repeated collisions has profound 
implications for our understanding of the Universe.
