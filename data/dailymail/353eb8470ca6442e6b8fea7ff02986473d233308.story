A man in Syria had his hand hacked off after an Islamic State court found him guilty of committing theft.

The news of the shocking act comes after Islamic State also published photos of a man being crucified for allegedly spying for the Assad regime. 

Both despicable acts were carried out in accordance with the extremist group’s radical interpretation of Sharia law.

No escape: Blindfolded by a beige, tasseled scarf and wearing a black leather jacket, the man is shown being led into the center of the street for his punishment

The amputation occurred after Friday prayers in the city of al-Bab in the Syrian province of Aleppo.

A large crowd of men and young boys, all wrapped up in winter coats and civilian wear, are shown eagerly waiting for the punishment to be carried out.

A number of the spectators can be seen standing on the top of several parked cars, hoping to get a better view of the horrific event.

His hands are tied behind his back and the rough hand of an Islamic State fighter is shown holding the man by his neck.

A bearded man, wearing a brown scarf and shirt, appears to be waiting attentively for the victim. Wearing a pair of white surgical gloves, the man is later shown tending to the man's freshly amputated arm. 

Close up images show a small wooden table with several items of medical equipment. A plastic, brown bottle, possibly containing a strong anti-septic or pain killer, is shown positioned on the table.

Several large gauze plasters and a reel of plastic tape also rest in preparation for the aftermath of the amputation.

Horrific: Islamic State has become known for its use of violent punishments for crimes such as adultery, blasphemy and theft. Often the punishments are publicly carried out and watched by a large crowd of locals

The final couple of photos show the Islamic State doctor cleaning the bleeding stump and carefully applying plastic tape to bandage up the wound.

The photos of the amputation were released just hours after Islamic State publicly crucified a man in Aleppo. 

The grey haired man, dressed in a white tracksuit top, reportedly admitted that he had been dropping a number of small microchip tracking devices near strategic ISIS buildings in Aleppo.

Last week, three men were publicly whipped by Islamic State fighters, for drinking wine in Iraq. The punishment was carried out in front of a large crowd in the Iraqi province of Kirkuk.

All three men, who appear to be in their late 40s, are shown kneeling on a large carpet with their hands resting on their laps.

An Islamic State fighter, dressed all in black, whips each man on the back a number of times. 

The final photos show the three men  hugging the soldier, who had just whipped them, in a staged scene of forgiveness.
