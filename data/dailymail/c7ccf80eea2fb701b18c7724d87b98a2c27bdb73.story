A taxi driver in Singapore has been hailed as a hero after he returned around £565,000 in cash to a Thai couple who left the money in a black paper bag in the back of his car.

Sia Ka Tian, 70, found $1.1million Singapore dollars in the vehicle after dropping the couple off at a shopping centre.

He received an undisclosed cash reward from the grateful couple and his company ComfortDelGro will also give him an award for good service.

Good deed: Sia Ka Tian found over £500,000 in the back of his car but returned the money

Reward: The couple gave him an undisclosed sum of money for his actions

'When I saw the money, I thought, trouble is here. I was sure there was at least $200,000 in the bag,' he told the Straits Times.

His colleagues counted the cash when he got back to the lost-and-found office and they discovered it contained far more than that.

But Tian said: 'The money is unimportant to me. It doesn't belong to me, so how can I use it?'

The Thai couple went to the company's office and were grateful to find Sia waiting for them when they got there.

Company spokeswoman Tammy Tan said: 
'Finding one million dollars in cash is not an everyday affair and in 
fact, we wonder how many people would have possibly been tempted to 
pocket it.'

'We are immensely proud of him and are glad that the passengers recovered their money.'

Whoops: This is the bag which was left in the back of the taxi after the couple disembarked at a shopping centre

Not an everyday affair: The driver was praised by his company for bringing the money back
