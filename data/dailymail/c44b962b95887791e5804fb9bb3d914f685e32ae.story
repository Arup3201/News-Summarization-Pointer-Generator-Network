The DiGiorno Pizza Twitter account accidentally crashed a conversation about domestic violence yesterday by misunderstanding the meaning behind a trending hashtag, and sending out a joke tweet.

Following the release of a video that clearly showed footballer Ray Rice's brutal domestic assault of then fiancée Janay Palmer in an Atlantic City hotel elevator, other abused and battered women took to Twitter to bravely share their stories, using #WhyIStayed.

That is when the DiGiorno account tweeted, '#WhyIStayed You had pizza.'

Big mistake: DiGiorno Pizza used a trending hashtag to make a joke about pizza, not knowing the hashtag was being used by abused  women who were sharing their stories following the release of the Ray Rice video

Many were angry and outraged the brand would joke about something so serious. 

The person behind the account quickly realized their mistake and apologized, writing, 'A million apologies. Did not read what the hashtag was about before posting.'

That's not all either, as they also then spent the entire day writing back individual responses on Twitter to the thousands who voiced their disgust that the brand would make light of something so horrible. 

Apologies: So the person behind the Twitter account started apologizing...

and apologizing ...

and apologizing...

and apologizing

The flub seems to have been forgiven by most as a result, including MSNBC TV host Ronan Farrow, who retweeted the brand's apology after he wrote to them, 'It's not delivery, it's domestic violence.'

This, of course, is a rife on DiGiorno's popular slogan, 'It's not delivery, it's DiGiorno.'

For good measure, the brand offered up one final apology this evening on Twitter, writing, 'We heard from many of you, and we know we disappointed you. We understand, and we apologize to everyone for this mistake.' 

Forgiven: After spending almost an entire day responding to complaints, it seems that many have forgiven the pizza brand

As for Rice, he was fired by the Baltimore Ravens and has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL following the release of yesterday's video. 

Earlier today, he spoke for the first time since the video surfaced, saying he and his wife 'are in good spirits' and that he must focus on being 'strong for my wife.'
