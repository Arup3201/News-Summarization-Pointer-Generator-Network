A father of seven whose arms and legs were amputated after doctors allegedly repeatedly failed to properly diagnose and treat an infection is suing the hospital he claims is responsible.

Robert Downey, 48, said staff at Sutter Memorial Hospital in Sacramento, California failed to spot that he had MSSA - a cousin of MRSA - even though they had treated his son for a similar just infection weeks earlier.

He claims that their oversights led to the amputations of his hands, his right leg at the knee and his left leg below the knee, leaving him to rely on his wife Cheri to carry out the simplest of tasks.

Life-changing: Robert Downey is suing a hospital after staff allegedly failed to spot and treat an infection that eventually led to the amputation of his arms and legs. He is pictured undergoing rehabilitation

'I'm a very independent person,' he said. 'Now I'm a very dependent person.'

Robert and Cheri Downey are suing the hospital and Sutter Health for medical malpractice, the Sacramento Bee reported.

Their attorney, Moselely Collins, said they want the hospital to take responsibility for its alleged mistakes and to 'warn hospitals not to let this happen in their emergency room'.

'We want to make sure that hospitals know that they have to treat these infections more seriously,' Collins told Fox40. 'They have to be better.'

Support: His wife Cheri had to make the agonizing decision to amputate his limbs as he was in a coma

MSSA, or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, is typically treatable with antibiotics if it is caught early.

It is referred to as the cousin of MRSA - the deadly infection found in hospitals that is resistant to numerous antibiotics.

MSSA bacteria can be passed through skin-to-skin contact and contact with towels, sheets or clothing used by an infected person.

It can affect tissues when the skin or mucus barriers have been broken, potentially causing infections, septic arthritis, pneumonia or infections of the heart valves.

Once its presence is confirmed through tests, it can be treated with penicillin. Yet some strands are resistant to penicillin, sparking a need for combination therapy.

Sutter Health said officials would not comment on the case, citing the ongoing litigation.

Downey,
who spent two decades in law enforcement before jobs as a prison 
correctional officer and a car salesman, first noticed something was 
wrong in summer 2011.

He 
and his wife had taken their 11-year-old son to Sutter Memorial after 
noticing the boy had developed a sore. Tests found he had MRSA, and he 
was treated and fully recovered, they said.

Yet
a few weeks later, Downey found he had a similar sore and became worried that
he had contracted the infection.

He visited the same physicians assistant,
who remembered his son, but did not undergo tests and was given oral antibiotics, he said.

After the sore failed to heal, he returned to the physician's assistant - but was sent home again.

By
his third visit, he had developed severe pain in his shoulder, which he
feared might be 'MRSA arthritis' - a symptom of the deadly infection.

He saw a different physician's 
assistant and told him about his symptoms, but the doctor said the sore 
and infection were not related and that he had bursitis, an inflammation.

Old days: Cheri and Robert are pictured before he is believed to have contracted the infection from his son

Struggle: He has prosthetic hands fitted but will need to undergo more rehabilitation before he can use prosthetic legs, pictured. He said that the hospital's failures have taken his independence away

'I did feel a little relieved,' Downey told the Sacramento Bee. 'I thought, "OK, I have bursitis". Hindsight is 20-20. I probably should have pressed harder.'

Days later, he collapsed at home and was taken to Mercy San Juan Medical Center in Carmichael. Two weeks later, on August 4, he underwent his first amputation.

As her husband was in a coma, Cheri was the one to make the decision to go ahead with the life-changing operations.

He said he remembered going to sleep holding his wife, and his next memory was waking up to be told that he had lost his hands and legs.

After more than a year of rehabilitation, he has been fitted with prosthetic 
hands to help him gain minimal independence. He will need more 
rehabilitation before he can be fitted with legs.

Scene: He was rushed to hospital after staff at Sutter Memorial, pictured, failed to take samples from a sore, even though they remembered treating his son for MRSA just weeks earlier, he said

Despite his astonishing progress, he is still struggling to come to terms with losing his limbs, he said.

'My mind hasn't caught up with my body,' he said. 'My mind needs to catch up with my body so I can be at ease.'

Cheri Downey, who set up a respite care business following the recession, has quit to care for her husband full-time. The couple has seven children between them, aged seven to 26.

The infection, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, is typically treatable with antibiotics if it is caught early.
