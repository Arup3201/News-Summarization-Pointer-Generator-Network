Beauty, they say, is in the eye of the beholder.

But as the Duchess of Cambridge’s first official portrait was unveiled to the public yesterday, art critics were, unusually, largely united in their condemnation.

‘Ghastly ... rotten ... an out and out disaster,’ was the view of the editor of the British Art Journal, Robin Simon.

‘It’s only saving grace is that it’s not by Rolf Harris,’ was the best that David Lee, now editor of The Jackdaw and a former editor of Art Review, could manage.

Kate, on her first official outing for almost a month, was far more polite. ‘It’s just amazing. Absolutely brilliant,’ she told the artist, Paul Emsley, when she met him at the National Portrait Gallery, where the picture will hang.

Her husband, Prince William, nodded sagely. ‘It’s beautiful, it’s absolutely beautiful,’ he concurred.

From others, however, the biggest criticism seemed to be the generally ageing nature of the portrait, which took three and a half months to produce.

Most seemed to think it makes the duchess, who turned 31 this week, look at least 15 years older.

Then there are the shadows and creases
 which give her a rather baggy-eyed look, not to mention the squareness 
of her jaw and the rather coppery tint to her famously tumbling brunette
 locks.

One onlooker at the gallery yesterday 
couldn’t get over what they described as her ‘grey, smoker’s skin’, 
while another commented that her mouth appears to be set in a grimace 
rather than the promised enigmatic smile.

The glittering sapphire and diamond earrings Kate wears in her portrait were once owned by Princess Diana, who received them as a wedding present from Prince Charles.

William’s mother was given the earrings by Charles because they bore a startling resemblance to her engagement ring – which is now also worn by the daughter-in-law she never got to meet.

Diana famously wore the jewels on the cover of Vogue in July 1994, as well as on numerous other public occasions.

After her death it is understood they were returned to Charles who gave them to his ‘darling daughter-in-law’ when she married William in 2011. Kate first wore them in public on her royal tour to Canada, after having them slightly remodelled.

While the director of the National 
Portrait Gallery, Sandy Nairne, declared himself delighted by such a 
‘captivating image’, most members of the public who trooped into Room 37
 after the unveiling took one look at the portrait before turning 
excitedly to the half-naked video of sleeping footballer David Beckham 
made by Sam Taylor-Wood, which was playing nearby.

To be fair, royal portraiture has 
always been a subjective issue. Rolf Harris, who was asked to paint the 
Queen in 2005, admitted that in the early stages he made the monarch 
look like a ‘pork butcher from Norwich’.

Mr Emsley, who has garnered plaudits 
for his wildlife paintings, has always divided critics with his 
realistic, almost ‘photographic’ style of painting.

Renowned critic Brian Sewell has 
described it as ‘sickening’, but the artist has won several prestigious 
awards including the 1997 BP Portrait Award.

The National Portrait Gallery, of which 
Kate is patron, drew up a shortlist of four painters but the duchess, 
who graduated from St Andrews with a 2:1 in history of art and 
previously studied at the British Institute in Florence, plumped for Mr 
Emsley.

She posed for the artist before she 
became pregnant, having one sitting at his studio in Bradford-on-Avon, 
Wiltshire, followed by another at Kensington Palace in London, in May 
and June last year.


  He also worked from a series of photos he took of the duchess.

The finished picture shows her in a 
Windsor blue pussy-bow blouse imagined by the artist because she wore 
different outfits for each of her sittings.

Yesterday Kate, wearing a burgundy 
dress from High Street store Whistles and displaying no sign of her 
12-week baby bump, brought along her parents, sister and brother for the
 great unveiling.

They spent around ten minutes looking 
at the picture before attending a private breakfast reception, after 
which the media were allowed in.

Asked what the duchess thought of his 
work, Mr Emsley said yesterday: ‘I think, from what I can see this 
morning, she’s delighted with it. I’m very happy about that.’

He said Kate had personally chosen the
 photo she wanted him to work from because of the way her hair fell, the
 light on her face and her expression generally.

But he admitted he had changed the 
colour of the duchess’s eyes slightly on finished oil to match ‘the 
background and the colour of her blouse’.

He added: ‘What she wanted was that the portrait should convey her natural self as opposed to her official self.

‘The fact she is a beautiful woman is,
 for an artist, difficult. When you have lines and  wrinkles it is much 
easier as an artist to capture them as a  person. Obviously she has none
 of that.

‘But I tried to do that with her smile and hope I have succeeded.’

The portrait, which is likely to have 
cost upwards of £20,000, has been donated to the gallery by art 
philanthropist Sir Hugh Legatt.
