Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman last night accused a Daily Mail columnist of 'victim blaming' over rape.

Miss Harman issued a lengthy statement after Sarah Vine wrote an article suggesting drunken women were not always without reproach where there are allegations of sexual assault.

The column, published yesterday, argued that too many women cry rape after making a mistake by having 'non-violent sexual encounters in dodgy circumstances'.  

Miss Harman said: 'Can't we ever leave behind the blame culture which says to the victim that she brought it on herself and therefore the man is the victim because he is accused?'

Sarah Vine wrote: 'You can blame someone else. You can make excuses. You can attempt to alleviate your own feelings of guilt and self-loathing by pinning responsibility on another' 

Miss Harman insisted: 'We're talking about a criminal offence. If I leave a window open an inch and someone breaks in, steals everything I own and ransacks my house no-one would say it wasn't a crime or that the offender had 'made a mistake'.

'Can't we ever leave behind the blame culture which says to the victim that she brought it on herself and therefore the man is the victim because he is accused?'

Her comments come after Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine wrote: 

'It used to be that women who made stupid mistakes with men, who had non-violent sexual encounters in dodgy circumstances — while drunk or otherwise intoxicated, in the heat of the moment or for a million other reasons — did not wake up the next morning and decide they had been raped.

'They took a shower, gave themselves a stern talking to, maybe told a friend about it, had a bit of a cry — and then moved on as best they could, vowing along the way never to end up in that kind of damn stupid situation again.

'Now, in our modern it's-anybody's-fault-but-mine culture, there's a far easier option. Blame the bloke.'
