Killed: Wendy Lawrence was shot and killed by state troopers after high-speed chase

A grandmother was shot and killed by state troopers after high-speed chase through the streets of New Hampshire.

Wendy Lawrence, 45, of Canterbury, N.H., was struck by gunfire four times by a state trooper, officials with the state attorney general's office said.

Following the Monday night shooting she was taken to a nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead.

Lawrence first attracted attention after a New Hampshire State Police trooper saw a Chevrolet Monte Carlo being driven 'erratically' on a southbound highway at roughly 6:30 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from Jeffery A. Strelzin, the senior assistant state attorney general.

Lawrence produced a non-driver's ID when the trooper asked her to produce a licence.

As the trooper checked out her ID in his car, during which time he discovered she was a habitual offender, she drove off.

After a short pursuit her car was found on an inter-state road, but Lawrence then sped away, nearly striking a person who was on the highway, reported NBC News. 

Multiple state police troopers aided in trying to apprehend Lawrence, following her to Kennard Street in Manchester, before she was shot. 

It is not clear what exactly prompted the trooper to fire 
his gun and officials have launched an investigation.

Shawn Healey, who was identified on Monday as the owner of the vehicle, said Lawrence had been using the car occasionally for the past eight months, reported the Chronicle Monitor.

'None of us know what happened,' Healey said.

'This doesn’t fit with (Wendy’s) character. She was a fun person to be around. She was not an aggressive person. . . . She would take the shirt off her back for anybody.'

Lawrence's boyfriend Charles Peter, nailed a cross and balloon in the grass to remember his girlfriend yesterday.

He told the Union Leader he had been dating Lawrence for nearly for years.

'They pretty much executed her,' he told the newspaper of the shooting.
