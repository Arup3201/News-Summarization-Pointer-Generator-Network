Could this be the answer to London's chronic housing shortage?

Tomorrow, Tower Hamlets council is expected to give the green light for developers to build a 784ft skyscraper on Canary Wharf which is being dubbed a 'town in a tower'.

Over 75 floors, the building will contain 822 homes as well as shops, a gym, a library, play and party areas, a cinema and a roof terrace.

The facilities will be split between 'amenity floors' located on the 27th and and 56th floors.

In their application, developer Chalegrove 
Properties, argues this will compensate for a lack of outdoor space for 
residents.

Living the high life: At the base of the tower there will be a cafe and play area for toddlers and a green space overlooking the River Thames

When the outdoors comes in: The building will include 'amenities' such as this children's play area to compensate for a lack of available outside space

Built on the site of an old pub, the City Pride, the tower will become the second-tallest building in Britain behind the Shard which stands at 1,016ft.

It has been designed by top London architects Squire & Partners.

Officers have recommended that Tower Hamlet's planning committee gives the project on Westferry Road the go-ahead on the basis that £4.2million is contributed to community services.

Almost 40 per cent of the properties must also be reserved for the area's low-income buyers.

The Mayor of London Boris Johnson, wrote recently that the shortage of affordable housing in the capital is ‘perhaps the gravest crisis the city faces’.

In a document he penned about the future of the capital, he called for restrictions on London councils to borrow to be lifted so they could build more homes.

'There is no need for this to appear on the books as public borrowing,' he said in his 11,000-word paper 'Ambitions for London'.

He estimated another 1 million homes will have to be built by the mid-2030s if London is to cope with demographic projections.

Mr Johnson added: 'Already 70 per cent of businesses say that the cost of housing in London is a major barrier to growth.'

'To address this crisis we need to act urgently and boldly.'

Earlier this year architects released plans to turn disused garages in Dalston, East London, into mini-homes which could be used by young professionals for just £11 a week.

If it is successful, the scheme will 
be expanded to other parts of London and throughout the UK, 
concentrating on areas where there are lots of homeless people or a 
shortage of housing for the young.

The architects are already in talks with a number of local authorities in hope of launching similar schemes.
