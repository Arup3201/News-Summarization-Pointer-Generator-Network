When Dr Philip Nitschke’s critics hear that he is going to do stand-up comedy at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this year they’ll be hoping his act dies on stage, but the voluntary euthanasia advocate is hoping for a much funnier ending.

The 67-year-old is teaming up with UK comedian Mel Moon, who has been diagnosed with a brain tumour, in an effort to provide some entertainment by laughing at death.

Dr Nitschke’s in need of a laugh as his medical registration was suspended by the Australian Medical Board in July 2014. An initial appeal to overturn his suspension from practising medicine was rejected earlier this month.

In his autobiography Dr Nitschke’s Damned If I Do he finishes it by saying that if his legal wrangles get too much he could always try stand-up comedy as ‘there are worse things than dying laughing’.

After reading the autobiography Ms Moon, who is just 35 years old and was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011, got in touch as the final line resonated wither her.

‘Her illness forced her to think about her mortality which is why she read my book and contacted me,’ Dr Nitschke, who lives in Darwin, explained.

‘We talked a lot about death and the choices she has before we ever talked about comedy. We talked about her having a peaceful end to her life, but it was really a matter of giving her that reassurance that was she was back in control.

‘She was very grateful for the exchange we had. But she was also looking at getting back into stand-up after taking a year or so off, because of her serious illness.

‘It was then she brought up the last line of my autobiography and said how it would make a good premise for a show, and if I’d be interested in taking part in it.’

The upshot of it all is they’re set to perform for a month at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August where they’ll do a one-hour show six nights a week.

No laughing matter: Dr Nitschke’s had his medical registration suspended by the Australian Medical Board in July 2014

Dr Nitschke has a lot of experiences to draw upon. In 1996, he became the first doctor in the world to administer a legal, lethal voluntary injection under the short-lived Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 (NT).

Four of his terminally ill patients used this law to end their suffering before the law was overturned in March 1997 by the Australian Parliament.

The same year, Dr Nitschke found the Voluntary Euthanasia Research Foundation (now called Exit International).

Despite not practising as a doctor for well over a decade however, his medical registration was suspended by the Australian Medical Board in July last year after he admitted to supporting 45-year-old Perth man Nigel Brayley's decision to take his own life despite knowing he was not terminally ill.

Dr Nitschke and MS Moon believe that there can still be laughs when it comes to death 

But he has now a chance to put his latest travails behind him, and although Dr Nitschke’s work may seem like one that wouldn’t raise many smiles, he believes this isn’t the case at all.

‘I have given a lot of workshops to many people in their 70s and 80s and they turn out to be excruciatingly funny affairs. Elderly people have a much more sanguine approach to their own mortality and to death in particular,’ he said.

‘Over the years many people have got a great amount of entertainment out of this subject. For some time I’d wondered if it would translate to a younger audience. Mel’s been forced now to engage with this issue because of her illness and her observations on it all are very funny.

‘The idea then is to put it all together in a format that’s entertaining and for it to be informative to the younger audiences that will see it.’ 

The Fringe Festival in Edinburgh has unearthed many new comedy talents over the years

Both Dr Nitschke and Ms Moon are currently working on the scripts, and they’ll be doing some face to face work soon. 

‘They tell me you sink or swim – or in our case, live or die – in the first few days at Edinburgh as the reviewers can be ruthless, so we’ll have to make sure we can make it as good as we can get it before then,’ he said.

If it all works the Edinburgh Fringe Festival will be only the start for the duo and they hope to bring the routine to Australia and beyond if it proves to be successful.

‘It really was a stroke of great luck that Mel materialised and took an interest in what we’re doing at Exit in the first place. It’s a pretty universal theme so we’ll just see how it goes,’ he said.

Dr Nitschke hopes that a successful run in Edinburgh could see the routine coming to Australia
