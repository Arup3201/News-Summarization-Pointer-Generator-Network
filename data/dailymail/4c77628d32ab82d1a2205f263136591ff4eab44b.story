Luis Suarez has admitted he is undergoing psychological help to prevent him from biting more opponents.

The striker was presented at the Nou Camp on Tuesday after making his debut on Monday night in a friendly, but is banned from competitive fixtures until October 25 after biting Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup.

Asked about how he was tackling his problem, Suarez said: 'That is a private matter, but I am speaking to professionals. The right professionals.

'I don't like having to go back (and think about it). When it happened afterwards I was really down.

'I spoke to my psychologist, he said I had to face reality and say I was sorry.'

Suarez was insistent that he has forgotten about the bite and dispelled rumours that there was a bite clause in his contract.

'I am trying to forget this game and this situation,' he said. 'It was a difficult moment for me. I say to the fans, "Don't worry about that (happening again).

'I'm here to do important things for Barcelona. Everything in the past needs to be forgotten.

'If I start thinking about everything I have had to go through I wouldn't be able to sleep.

'This is a club I have dreamed of playing for since I was a boy and I want to make the most of it.'

Suarez admitted he had worried that biting Chiellini, adding to his assaults on Otman Bakkal and Branislav Ivanovic, may have scuppered his Barcelona move.

He was also sad to be missing the start of the season and also the Copa America with Uruguay next year.

'It hurts, just knowing I'm missing official games for Barca, it hurts even more to know I'm missing games for Uruguay,' he explained.

'Not being able to play in the Copa America hurts so much. All I can do is accept it and try to forget and give my support from outside.'

Questions continued to flood in about his suspension and Suarez said he has accepted FIFA's punishment and is just trying to get ready to make his debut against Real Madrid.

The four-month ban from competitive matches ends by October 25, the weekend which features the first Clasico of the season.

'You're asking me about the suspension, I have to accept that and get ready to play against Real Madrid. The ban is what it is.

'I don't see any problems with arriving in good shape (for the Clasico). But it all depends on the manager to say if I can play or not.'

Sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta confirmed that he was hoping that Uruguay would play Suarez in their two friendlies shortly before that match, to get him up to speed.

Suarez recalled being at the Nou Camp when Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid 5-0 and said he has always had the Catalan giants in his heart.

'For years I've been dreaming of playing for Barca. Every little boy knows, this is something that they want, and my family was here as well.

'To come here and watch Barca play and that one day I would be able to play here, I didn't think it was going to happen.

'When the opportunity arose I didn't think twice. It's something I've been dreaming of since I was a little boy.'

At Barcelona Suarez will form part of a devastating front trio featuring Neymar and Lionel Messi.

But the Uruguayan balked at the idea that he was the star signing of the summer.

'Stars are in the sky,' said Suarez. 'If one person thinks they are the only person on the field, we can't win titles.'

He also confirmed that he was happy to play anywhere manager Luis Enrique wanted to play him, whether that be on the left, the right, or in a central role.

Although he didn't get to play with either of his South American strike partners on Monday night, he was thrilled to make his debut.

'Obviously it was very exciting, spectacular for me. It was a dream for me. 'I've never played at the Nou Camp. To come out and see the fans was interesting for me, I loved it.

'It hasn't sunk in yet, I can't believe it. I never imagined that such a beautiful thing would ever happen to me.'
