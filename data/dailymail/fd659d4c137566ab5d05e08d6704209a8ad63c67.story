Chelsea Clinton lives a charmed life, but don't be fooled: secretly, she's not attached to the oodles of money she and her hedge fund manager husband make each year, the former first daughter said in an interview published over the weekend.

Philanthropy is her true passion, Clinton said, and that's why she permanently left Wall Street to join the Clinton Foundation, which
 she runs with her parents, former first couple Bill and Hillary 
Clinton.

'I was curious if I could care about [money] on 
  some fundamental level, and I couldn’t,' Clinton told The Telegraph. 'That wasn’t the metric of success I 
  wanted in my life.'

Chelsea says she has finally found her passion in philanthropy and really doesn't care about making money

Despite Chelsea's self-proclaimed disinterest in money-making, a report last week surfaced that she was paid $600,000 by NBC last year to do a smattering of reporting

It is not uncommon for well-known anchors to earn multiple millions per
 year, but Clinton's reported annual salary is high for the frequency of
 her segments.

By comparison, her salary is higher than both of the last two editors of the New York Times.

The
 paycheck from her NBC contract has helped Chelsea and her husband Marc Mezvinsky 
buy a $10.5 million apartment next to New York's Madison 
Square Park 
last spring.

Politico said at the time of its report that the 34-year-old, 
who is expecting her first child later this year, is now on a 
month-to-month contract that would ease her departure should her mother 
decide to run for president in 2016.

It
 later came to light that Clinton was still being paid $50,000 a month 
by NBC despite the fact that she hasn't been featured since 
January.

NBC News has aired two stories by Chelsea
 Clinton so far in 2014, both on education programs targeting the 
underprivileged that were shown on Nightly News in January.

The news network told the Associated Press that it does expect two completed stories to 
air soon, however, and two others are in the works.

NBC reportedly wanted to 
avoid the appearance of a conflict by having her on the air around the 
time Hillary Clinton was doing a round of media interviews about her new
 book Hard Choices.

In any case, Hillary has been hitting the airwaves more than her daughter.

The former secretary of state has participated in TV interviews across every major network in the last three weeks, making eyebrow raising statements of her about the Clinton family's financial outlook.

'We 
came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debt. We had no 
money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the 
resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea’s education. You know, 
it was not easy,' Hillary said.

On Monday Chelsea sported a big chain necklace, a stack of rings on her neatly manicured hand and a  maternity pantsuit

Thanks to eight years in the White House and lucrative speaking gigs and book deals afterward, Bill and Hillary were able to pay for Chelsea to attend Sidwell Friends private school as a teenager and Stanford and Oxford universities.

After college, Chelsea experimented in management-consulting and 
dabbled in her now-husband's career field of hedge fund management.

She
 left Wall Street in 2008 to help out with her mom's presidential 
campaign, returning briefly after Hillary lost the Democratic Primary, 
before determining that she would attend Columbia to get her Masters in 
public health.

She graduated from Columbia in the spring of 2010 and married Mezvinsky that summer.

The high-profile wedding was held at the former home of millionaire businessman John Jacob Astor IV on 50 acres of land overlooking the Hudson River in Rhinebeck, New York. The wedding boasted 500 guests and was said to cost more than $3 million. Her custom-made Vera Wang dress cost approximately $25,000 alone.

Clinton also began working at New York University as the Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network that year.

She left NYU in 2011 and took a contract with NBC and a position at the Clinton Foundation, instead.

In her interview with the Telegraph, 
Clinton also addressed the perception that she's the beneficiary of 
presidential privilege, and it is her pedigree, not her talent employers
 seek.

'I will just 
always work harder [than anybody else] and hopefully perform better. And
 hopefully, over time, I pre-empt and erase whatever expectations people
 have of me not having a good work ethic, or not being smart, or not 
being motivated.'

Clinton is the second presidential 
daughter to get work at NBC; Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of George W. 
Bush, is a Today show correspondent.

Besides
 Nightly News, Clinton was hired to do stories for Brian Williams' Rock 
Center newsmagazine, which has since been canceled.

Much of her work
 falls under the umbrella of NBC's Making a Difference stories, about 
various efforts to make communities better.

Bush's
 daughter seems genuinely interested in being a television journalist, 
while that doesn't appear to be the case with Clinton.

Clinton herself told the Telegraph that she felt called to the same field as her parents despite trying 'really hard to care about things that were very 
  different' from them.

Chelsea may even have a political career of her own ahead of her.

'I
 live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected 
representatives. If at some point that weren’t the case, maybe then I’d 
have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different 
answer,' she said.

Clinton has not indicated whether she intends to keep her contact with NBC News after her baby is born.
