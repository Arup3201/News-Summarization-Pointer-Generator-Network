Kanye West today became the most famous visitor yet to the Occupy Wall Street protests as he lent his support to a demonstration that started with a few people and has turned into a global movement.

He is by far the most well-known celebrity to have visited the demonstrators' camp in Zuccotti Park, New York, following in the footsteps of actors Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon and Penn Badgley.

His visit came on a day when children not in school for Columbus Day joined the ranks of adult protesters in calling for change in how the U.S. political and economic systems are run.

Big name: Singer Kanye West visits demonstrators with Occupy Wall Street on Monday in New York

In attendance: Kanye West is known for being outspoken on social issues and he is the most famous singer to have visited the protests so far

The protests against the state of the U.S. political
and economic systems have now spread to more than 25 cities - from 
Sacramento to Seattle, Anchorage to Atlanta and Mobile to Minneapolis.

Other famous names who visited the New York site on Monday included Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam records, and civil rights campaigner the Reverend Al Sharpton.

Kanye West is estimated by Forbes to have earned $16million over the past year - making him the third highest earner in the hip-hop industry at the moment, only behind P. Diddy and Jay-Z.

The singer - who once famously stated 'George Bush doesn't care about black people' in a Hurricane Katrina appeal - was pictured in New York wearing a customary gold chain and gold grill on his teeth.

Saw and Lethal Weapon actor Danny Glover was at the Occupy LA protests in California at the weekend - and Ben & Jerry's ice-cream also got behind the national movement today.

Michael Bloomberg said he will allow Occupy Wall Street protesters to stay indefinitely at their Manhattan village - but suggested some have only camped out there because of the warm weather.

The New York City Mayor said
demonstrators will only be allowed to stay in Zuccotti Park as long as 
they obey the laws, after protester numbers swelled this weekend as the 
city enjoyed warm weather.

But as the Occupy Wall Street protest 
continued in full strength in Manhattan today, the atmosphere in New 
York's financial district has become increasingly debauched.

Conspicuously living among the 
politically active in the makeshift village in Zuccotti Park are 
opportunistic junkies and homeless people - making the most of the free 
food on offer.
