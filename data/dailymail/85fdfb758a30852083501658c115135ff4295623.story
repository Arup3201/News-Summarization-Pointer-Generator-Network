An Australian woman who tested positive for the same BRCA2 gene as Angelina Jolie has died, just weeks before she was due to undergo urgent cancer treatment in China.

Gold Coast resident Elisha Neave, 36, delayed having a preventative mastectomy and hysterectomy after testing positive for the gene disorder that gives an 80 per cent risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer.

Despite her sisters having the operation, the mother-of-one initially delayed preventative surgery to have more children.

Her two older sisters, who also tested positive to the gene, had their breasts removed immediately but Elisha decided to wait so she could have another child.

She was diagnosed with cancer in March 2012 at the age of 34.

Elisha underwent treatment in Australia but with no sign of improvement and weighing just 34kg she travelled to Germany for treatment.

Despite the cancer weakening by 95 per cent, it returned in a more aggressive form.

She was due to undergo intense and urgent treatment in China but her partner Brendan Hopp told the Gold Coast Bulletin they had to delay the flights because of poor health.

Elisha died in hospital early Wednesday morning surrounded by her family.

‘I held her hand the whole time and she passed very peacefully... she had accepted it,’ Mr Hopp said.

‘In February last year, doctors said it would be a miracle if she made it to Christmas 2013 but she made it all the way to April 2014.’

Her family announced her death via a Facebook post on Wednesday afternoon.

‘After the bravest of fights our little girl slipped away peacefully at 12.30 last night with Dad’s tunes on the radio amid the laughter and tears that comes with a typical Neave gathering,’ the post read.

‘As you can imagine we are feeling very fragile broken and so pleased and comforted that she is free from pain and now we have two angels guiding and watching over us.’

Elisha’s father passed away from cancer last year.

She is survived by her 10-year-old son Jack.

Hollywood actress Jolie underwent a preventative double mastectomy in February, 2013, after being told she had an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer.
