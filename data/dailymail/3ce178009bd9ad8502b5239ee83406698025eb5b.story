Schools rugby Leaders Wellington start a hectic week in the Daily Mail Schools Trophy at Hampton on Saturday following the half-term break. 

Three games in seven days will test a strong squad who have six players in the England under 18 and 17 training squads. 

This all-round strength has powered Wellington to the top of the merit-table based competition organised by schoolsrugby.co.uk.

Reed’s (White) have put together an unbeaten run of six games in the Trophy

Wellington also face third-placed Sedbergh at Broadstreet (kick off 6pm) on Tuesday followed by a trip to fifth-placed Epsom College on Saturday week. 

Hampton, who have had an injury-hit autumn, have the squad to test Wellington. They raised confidence by defeating St Benedict’s, in a curtain-raiser to the Ealing-Hartpury National League clash, last Saturday.

A try from flanker Chris Penton proved the difference for Hampton in an 11-8 victory. Full-back Will Attfield also kicked two penalties. Sedbergh, who have five players in national training squads, are putting together a strong pack led by the consistency of back-rower Freddie Renwick. 

Reed’s the latest coming on Wednesday, 46-31, against Caterham (Yellow and black)

A 33-17 win at Barnard Castle featured two tries from hooker Jack Solman. If the Cumbrians, who lost 14-10 to Wellington last season, win this latest heavyweight tussle next Tuesday they will then be in line to push to for the title with fixtures against Kirkham, Warwick and Millfield to come.

A group of unbeaten teams are also in pursuit of Wellington including Kirkham, the Lancastrians who face Sedbergh on Saturday week, Reed’s, the Cobham-based school, and Stamford. Reed’s have put together an unbeaten run of six games in the Trophy, the latest coming on Wednesday, 46-31, against Caterham. 

This follows other good scalps against Brighton College, 16-8, and Oratory, 22-10. Brighton, who host Epsom tomorrow (Nov 8), needed last-ditch scores to gain a 19-19 draw against Eton. The crucial points came from lock Saasha Agureev and a conversion by Elliot Hall.
