The transsexual wife killer who was granted a state-funded sex change may also be provided with  electrolysis hair removal at the cost of the taxpayer.

A judge ruled that Michelle Lynne Kosilek, 63, of Mansfield, Massachusetts, who was born Robert Kosilek, should have an expert opinion to decide if the procedure is medically necessary.

Electrolysis is a beauty treatment carried out at many salons, where body hair is permanently removed by applying heat to the follicle through a small probe.

Attention: Convicted killer and transsexual Michelle Lynne Kosilek, 63, is to be assessed to see if she needs electrolysis hair removal... paid for by the taxpayer

The Department of Corrections was ordered to find an expert to evaluate Kosilek by November 2, according to the Boston Herald.

Most male-to-female transsexuals need electrolysis treatment to remove facial hair while they are undergoing their gender change.

Kosilek has already received hormone 
treatments, psychotherapy and electrolysis previously while serving a life sentence
as a woman in an all-male prison.

Federal Judge Mark Wolf decided last month that the killer is entitled to be reimbursed by the state for years of legal bills because the state prisons department violated Kosilek's rights by refusing to pay for a sex change.

The state is appealing that decision. In a hearing set for November 19, a state prison doctor will testify that Kosilek does not need the treatment after already testifying to the same assessment two years ago.

In
2002, Wolf ruled that Kosilek was entitled to treatment for 
gender-identity disorder, but stopped short of ordering surgery.

Kosilek sued again in 2005, arguing that the surgery is a medical necessity.

'The
court finds that there is no less intrusive means to correct the 
prolonged violation of Kosilek's Eighth Amendment right to adequate 
medical care,' Wolf wrote in his 126-page ruling.

Prison
officials have repeatedly cited security concerns in the case, saying 
that allowing her to have the surgery would make her a target for sexual
assaults by other inmates.

But Wolf found that the DOC's security concerns are 'either pretextual or can be dealt with by the DOC.'

Convicted: Robert Kosilek was convicted of murder in the killing of his wife in 1990. He is pictured on May 24, 1990, being led to the county jail following his arraignment on drunken driving charges, in New Rochelle, NY

Black out: Kosilek has said that he did not remember killing his wife Cheryl

The 63-year-old legally changed his 
name to Michelle Lynne Kosilek nearly 20 years ago and has been living 
and dressing as a woman at the all-male MCI-Norfolk state prison.

He has tried to kill himself twice and
also threatened to castrate himself because he is so distressed over 
his gender identity. Wolf said the sex change was a 'serious medical 
need'.

According to research by psychiatry professor George R. Brown at East Tennessee State University, 27,000 people nationwide have gender identity disorder.

Experts estimate 500 to 750 Americans undergo the surgery each year, with hundreds more seeking the procedure abroad.

Federal courts have said prisons must provide adequate medical care, and that they must protect inmates from themselves.

But correctional officials and lawmakers balk at using taxpayer money for sex-change operations that can cost up to $20,000.

Brown estimates that at least 750 of the more than 2 million prisoners nationwide had gender identity disorder in 2007, his latest count. 

Kosilek was convicted of first-degree murder in the 
killing of his wife, Cheryl, in 1990.

Cheryl Kosilek was found dead in the back seat of her car in a shopping mall parking lot on Sunday, May 20, 1990.

Markings showed she had been strangled 
with a rope and a wire and a taxicab driver testified in court that he 
had picked up Kosilek from that very mall in the afternoon and driven 
him home.

A few hours later, Kosilek called police to report his wife missing, suggesting that she might have gotten into a car accident.

Police
picked him up at his Mansfield home and questioned him, telling him 
that 'a body was found in the back seat' of Cheryl's abandoned vehicle.

Kosilek
said his wife was at work all day and had intended to stop by the mall 
afterwards and that he was busy at the couple's home all day.

Timothy
McCaul, Cheryl's 15-year-old son who lived with the couple, said that 
he called home for a ride around 5 pm and no one answered the phone.

Kosilek was questioned again, only this time he left half way through the interview and said he was getting an attorney.

Two days later, Kosilek was involved in a car crash at midnight. Officers found him in the driver's seat dressed in women's clothing and sent him home.

On May 24, 1990, Kosilek was stopped for speeding in New Rochelle, New York, and arrested him for drunk driving.

'You would be drunk too if the police thought you killed your wife,' he said.

Later,
at the police station, the defendant stated, 'Look, I had a fifteen-year-old son and a wife. I can't call my wife. I murdered my wife. Now, I
need to call a psychiatrist now.'

He later admitted to a reporter that 
he and his wife got into a heated argument during the day and she had 
thrown boiling water in his face.

He picked up a wire and blacked out, waking up days later in the hospital.

'Apparently, I did take her life,' he told the reporter. 'It was probably in self-defense.'

Change: Kosilek first sued the Massachusetts Department of Correction 12 years ago

After he was indicted for the crime, he began the transition from male to female and legally changed his name to Michelle.

Kosilek's lawsuit has become fodder for radio talk shows and lawmakers who say the state should not be forced to pay for a convicted murderer's sex-change operation – which can cost up to $20,000 – especially since many insurance companies reject the surgery as elective.

Wolf noted that Kosilek's gender-identity disorder has caused Kosilek such anguish that she has tried to castrate herself and twice tried to commit suicide, including once while on Prozac.

Kosilek's lead attorney, Frances Cohen, called the decision courageous and thoughtful.

'We feel very grateful that the judge listened very carefully to the medical experts and has given Michelle Kosilek what the prison doctors had recommended,' Cohen said.

Inmates in Colorado, California, Idaho 
and Wisconsin have sued unsuccessfully to try to get the surgery, making
similar arguments that denying it violates the U.S. Constitution's 
protection against cruel and unusual punishment.

'This is not a choice. Transsexuals are born and not made,' said psychiatry professor George R. Brown at East Tennessee State University.

'If you didn't have this condition, why would you want to have your genitals removed, if not by a competent surgeon but by your own hand?'
