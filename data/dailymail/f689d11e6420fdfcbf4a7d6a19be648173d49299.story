Arsenal star Mesut Ozil was a surprise guest at world famous DJ Steve Aoki’s set and even helped drop a cake onto fans

The midfielder is currently on holiday in Las Vegas on a prolonged pre-season break after winning the World Cup with Germany this summer.

The Gunners star joined Aoki standing above the crowd on stage in front of a massive crowd before the DJ and Ozil pranked the public, launching a huge cake on their heads.

Ozil experienced a mixed first season at Arsenal in the Premier League, scoring five goals and notching up nine assists but failed to live up to his hype on a consistent basis after his £42.5 million move from Real Madrid last summer.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has granted Ozil and his fellow Arsenal World Cup winners with Germany, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski  a well-deserved break after helping Germany to success in Brazil.

The trio will not return to pre-season training at Arsenal until August 11, the day after the Community Shield clash versus Manchester City and just five days prior to the first Premier League match against Tony Pulis' Crystal Palace side.
