Britain's high-end housing market is in the grip of rich property dealers avoiding millions in tax and making huge profits which drives up prices, an investigation has revealed.

At the heart of this powerful network of speculators is the British Virgin Islands - where the haven status allows the rich to build colossal property empires in the UK under cloaked in secrecy.

In the last year more than £7billion of offshore funds has flooded into Britain, buying up some of London's most exclusive and expensive buildings and homes.

This flurry of interest by dealers is forcing up the prices of all properties in London and other parts of the UK, experts say.

Exclusive: Properties inside One Hyde Park, London's most expensive address, have been bought up by offshore investors who can avoid tax and are driving up prices

Expensive: Flats in One Hyde Park can go for more than £100million but offshore buyers need not pay stamp duty, inheritance tax and capital gains tax

The trend has been highlighted in a joint probe by the Guardian and the Washington based International Consortium of Investigative 
Journalists.

One group of investors has bought up huge chunks of One Hyde Park near Harrods, dubbed the world's most expensive address, with purchase prices ranging between £3million and £136million.

Others have bought up the £97million Riverside House development on the Thames, the £30million 'Ark' building in Hammersmith as well as eight homes on Grosvenor Crescent in Belgravia worth £85million.

Properties like these in central London are already worth 49 per cent more than in 2009 - five times higher than the increase in the rest of Britain.

As well as huge profits, investors using an offshore company also get substantial tax benefits:

Offshore property investments from the BVI are rocketing upwards, reaching £3.8billion in the last year, up from £2.7billion in 2010 and £1.5billion in 2009.

There have been almost 100,000 of these transactions from abroad since 1999.

The system also allows the person buying property to do it in secret by paying just £1,000 to a company who will keep their name, legally, off the land registry.

Buy: The £30million 'Ark' in Hammersmith, London, is also owned from abroad

Luxury: Ofcom's headquarters, Riverside house, which stands on the Thames, is worth nearly £100million and is owned by an offshore company

This, in theory, would allow the rich to hide assets from the authorities, launder money from criminal enterprises and avoid tax in the country they own homes in.

The Guardian has found that a Treasury report in 2001 warned of the abuses but the recommendations were rejected by the Blair government of the time.

'Parliament has decided that ownership of property should be in the public domain. The ability of owners to register land and property under names which conceal rather than reveal who they are flies in the face of the principle which parliament established.'

Making sure people must be named would be 'invaluable for law enforcement, regulatory and tax authorities', he wrote and 'deter the unscrupulous from putting the proceeds of crime into property assets' and be 'helpful in tracing bankrupt persons and combating mortgage fraud'.

'If public policy emphasises privacy above transparency, the greatest beneficiaries are likely to be criminals,' he added.

A consortium also bought some of these homes on Grosvenor Crescent in Belgravia - worth £85million

They are the epitome of London luxury but their purchase is part of a mad scramble for London property in recent years

Meanwhile the Government has already promised to investigate other suspicious practices revealed yesterday.

Tens of thousands of bogus 
companies are set up in Britain and fronted by sham directors dotted around 
the globe is helping aggressive tax evaders and criminals keep millions.

An
undercover BBC probe has exposed the illegal scam after they secretly 
filmed brokers bragging they had more chance of 'winning the lottery' 
than being caught by HM Revenue and Customs.

Tonight's
Panorama lays bare a network of at least 21,000 of these companies, 
headed by just a few dozen puppet managers in various obscure countries 
who are paid just to front the tax fiddle.

Today Business Secretary Vinmce Cable told The Guardian: 'I can assure you that we will investigate fully any specific allegations and ensure that appropriate action is taken … If we identify a need for further action as a result of that review, we will not be afraid to take it.'
