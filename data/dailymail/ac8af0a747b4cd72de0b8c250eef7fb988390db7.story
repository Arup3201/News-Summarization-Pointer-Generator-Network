Two New York men are suing the New Jersey Lottery after they threw out a Powerball ticket worth $1 million.

Salvatore Cambria and Erick Onyango, of Suffern, New York, argue in their federal lawsuit that the lottery didn't quickly update its website with the winning numbers from the March 23 drawing.

Cambria tells The Record newspaper he asked Onyango to check the website soon after the 11pm drawing.

Cambria tossed the ticket when the numbers didn't match. The men now think the site was showing the previous drawing's numbers.

The pair said they realized they had won the next day. But by then, their ticket was on its way to a landfill in Canada.

In their desperation at having lost the vast sum, the men at one point considered  hiring a bloodhound to search for the trash bag. 

The men said that they have two other tickets showing serial numbers above and below the winning ticket that prove they had a winner.

A spokesman for the Lottery Commission refused to comment on the ongoing litigation.

The Powerball on March 23, which had a $338 million jackpot, was won by Pedro Quezada from Passaic.
