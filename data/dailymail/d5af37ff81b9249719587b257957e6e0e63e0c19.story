Peter Salmon, senior BBC executive and a former head of sport, has emerged as a contender to become the new general secretary of the FA.

Salmon, who organised the BBC move to Manchester, worked very closely at the Corporation alongside FA chairman Greg Dyke when the latter was director general.

And Salmon, who is married to the actress Sarah Lancashire, was able to win back a number of important football rights for the BBC, including the FA Cup, England internationals and Match of the Day Premier League highlights because of a large increase in the sports budget agreed by Dyke.

Also Salmon’s potential candidature could explain why Dyke remains in favour of not employing headhunters for the search, preferring the FA board to save money by choosing from their pool of contacts.

Another early name in the frame to replace the departing Alex Horne is Stewart Regan, who has impressed Dyke and others at Wembley with the way he has re-organised the Scottish FA as chief executive since leaving Yorkshire cricket.

The FA remain remarkably confident that a sponsor for the FA Cup will finally be found before the third round — and one prepared to match the £9m a year paid by previous backers Budweiser. 

It is understood that another beer company are still in talks but the clock is ticking with the third-round draw on December 8.

Wayne Rooney's agent Paul Stretford is one of the concerned middle men who has had discussions with the FA about Terry Byrne - who heads the 1966 agency who represent the England players - also looking after Jack Wilshere through Byrne’s new sports management agency, 10Ten Talent.

Byrne received the go-ahead from the FA to sign England regular Wilshere but the conflict of interests has upset some FA sponsors and other agents looking after England footballers.

England women’s match against Germany at Wembley on Sunday will draw a capped crowd of 55,000. 

Remarkable as that record attendance is, the match could have attracted as many as 75,000, such was the ongoing demand for tickets had Underground engineering works not led to the restrictions.

And more viewers will tune in to the BBC’s live coverage of the women’s international than will watch either of the two Premier League matches on Sky.

TIME TO BAN THE BAND?

England Fans FC manager Garford Beck has complained to the FA about the England supporters’ band encouraging offensive chanting during the Scotland match.

Beck, who was in the England section at Celtic Park, intends to make an official complaint to Strathclyde Police if the FA don’t take action against the band, whose drumbeat to the repetitive singing of ‘F*** the IRA’ happened regularly during the first half until an FA official told them to stop.

Beck claims the band’s actions were a lot worse than him and three colleagues wearing T-shirts during Euro 2012 calling for the release from prison of former Ukrainian leader Yulia Tymoshenko - for which they received official warnings from the FA.

Meanwhile, Pukka Pies will be relieved their eight-year sponsorship of the band finished before the World Cup, sparing them any further association with a discredited outfit.

It is considered unlikely the band will find fresh backers to fund their England trips, although band leader John Hemmingham and the FA have apologised.

ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley had to re-record his commentary of England’s first goal against Scotland after wrongly identifying the scorer as Wayne Rooney rather than Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. 

However, from where Tyldesley was sitting in the woefully antiquated Celtic Park press box, the scorer’s body shape did look remarkably like Rooney, who was also credited with the goal initially by the England Twitter feed and Stan Collymore on talkSPORT. But BBC Radio 5 Live’s John Murray called the goal for the Ox first time.
