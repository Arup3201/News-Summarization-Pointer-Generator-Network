Congress' top GOP watchdog is warning the secretary of Health and Human Services to stop instructing contractors behind healthcare.gov not to talk to Congress about the project.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chair Darrell Issa, a hard-charging California Republican, told Sec. Kathleen Sebelius in a letter on Wednesday that it's against the law to get between Congress and the companies her agency hired to work on  the crash-and-burn website.

'Obstructing a Congressional 
investigation is a crime,' Issa said Thursday in a statement.

'The federal 
obstruction laws reflect the fact that Congress’ right of access to 
information is constitutionally based,' his letter warned,' and critical to the integrity and 
effectiveness of our oversight and investigative activities. ... Private citizens and companies 
cannot contract away their duty to comply with a congressional request 
for documents.'

Issa also alleged that muzzling the website contractors violates a federal whistleblower law that 'prohibits interfering with an employees’ right to furnish information to
 Congress.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa is a no-nonsense investigator whose knife-in-the-teeth approach to Obamacare has rankled Democrats for more than a year

What, me worry? U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has made several appearances on Capitol Hill to defend the Obama administration's handling of the national health insurance overhaul

'Any effort to enforce a
 contract that prevents a federal employee – or in this case, a 
contractor – from communicating with Congress is unlawful,' he wrote.

On Dec. 6, Issa says, HHS told at least one contractor not to respond to congressional requests for documents related to the failed website rollout, insisting that the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should be the only source of information Congress gets.

Issa has been conducting an aggressive investigation into the mistakes made in contracting, building, and testing the website, which quickly became a national punchline after it went live.

Part of that probe involved requesting information from 11 of the most active companies that worked on the site.

But in the Dec. 6 letter Issa obtained, HHS notified 
a contractor called Creative Computing Solutions that its contract forbade it from providing documents to third parties, 
including members of Congress.

'If you receive a request for this information from Congress,' the government department wrote, 'CMS will respond directly to the requestor.'

Muzzled: Executives from the biggest Obamacare website contractors had their turn before Congress on Oct. 24, weeks before HHS started telling them to freeze lawmakers out of their document chains.

Healthcare.gov, the main national Obamacare portal, has been a debacle for the Obama administration following crashes and extended downtime following its Oct. 1 launch

Issa cited HHS's antagonism toward his committee, but said in his letter that trying to put a gag on potential witnesses was a bridge too far.

'The Department’s most recent effort to stonewall, however, has morphed from mere obstinacy into criminal obstruction of a congressional investigation,' he wrote Sebelius.

Obstruction of justice is a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.

Issa's oversight committee issued a subpoena on Oct. 31 for documents in HHS's possession that could help explain how healthcare.gov cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build but brought such widely documented disappointment..

Those documents, he said Wednesday, would include everything he has requested from the 11 contractors. Sebelius' agency hasn't turned them over, most recently citing the time burden of finding and cataloging so much information for Congress.
