Barry Dyson, 39, was jailed for 16 weeks today for using a mirror to look up women's skirts in shops

An accountant who used a mirror to peep up women's skirts while they shopped is the first person in the UK to be banned from carrying any reflective object in public. 

Barry Dyson, 39, sneaked up behind five unsuspecting women in Harvey Nichols and Selfridges and used a mirror to look up their skirts at their 'knickers and buttocks'.

When quizzed by security staff, he admitted he had gone to the stores to do Christmas shopping and 'peek up women's skirts'.  

The serial offender was today jailed for up to 16 weeks at Manchester magistrates' court.   

Jailing him, District Judge Jonathan Feinstein said: 'I hope this is a big shock to you. Having been given opportunities you still resorted to this type of wholly unacceptable, insidious and disrespectful behaviour.'

He went on to say the women didn't know they were being spied on which made the case 'even more sinister'.

As well as the ban on carrying any reflective item in public, Dyson must surrender any recording device in his possession if asked to do so by the police. He must also pay an £80 victim surcharge.   

Dyson, from Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, was spotted acting suspiciously in Harvey Nicholls in Manchester city centre on November 30 last year.

Security staff initially suspected him of stealing until they saw him take a mirror from his rucksack and go behind two females.

When he was approached, he said he had gone to the store 'to do Christmas shopping and peek up women's skirts', before telling police 'it turned me on'.

Manchester magistrates' court was also told it was not the first time Dyson had been caught indulging in warped behaviour.

The court was told that he had been convicted of similar offences in 2009 and given a five-year-anti-social behaviour order.

He was also convicted under the public order act in 2004 and 2005 for offences of a like nature.

Prosecuting, Tess Kenyon said: 'He wandered from shop to shop and on each occasion crouched down behind a female shopping and held a mirror under her skirt in order to see the image of her knickers and buttocks. 

'He was arrested and he accepted there would be video on his phone of similar acts. He had downloaded them and it wasn't footage of him.'

In mitigation, Andrew Fitch-Holland said: 'When he was arrested in Harvey Nicholls he was taken to the police station where he made full admissions to the offence but then on his own volition explained that he had been in other shops.

'In fact each admission went beyond the offence for which he was detained. His previous offending behaviour is a matter of grave concern. He recognises his particular predilection is disgraceful, distressing and wholly inappropriate.'

Mr Fitch-Holland said Dyson blamed his latest lapse on problems at work, his snooker team folding and a family bereavement.

Sentencing, District Judge Fernstein added: 'It is something which in a way undermines the position of these women and is distasteful beyond belief. You have had opportunities to get help and treatment.

'When you are confronted with difficulties you resort back to this behaviour. Whatever difficulties you have there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. For women not knowing anything going on to be violated in this way is unacceptable. You have had opportunities to sort this out and you have done it again.'
