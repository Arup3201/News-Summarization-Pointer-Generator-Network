Families who urgently need a passport to go on holiday will have their applications fast-tracked for no extra cost, as ministers scrambled today to clear the 500,000 backlog.

Home Secretary Theresa May also announced that people applying to renew their passports abroad to come back to the UK would be given an automatic 12-month extension.

Those applying for passports overseas for their children would also be issued with emergency travel documents for travel to the UK - although they will still have to provide 'comprehensive proof' that they are the parents.

Home Secretary Theresa May announced a raft of emergency measures today to tackle the 500,000 passport backlog

Mrs May has drafted in emergency staff to - earning up £70 an hour - to the Passport Office to clear the backlog.

Around 100 Home Office staff based in the North have been asked to move to the Liverpool Passport Office for up to two months, a letter leaked to MailOnline revealed.

This is on top of the 250 backroom staff at the Passport Office which have already been redeployed to the front line.

But MPs have complained that even they have been unable to get through to jammed telephone lines to raise urgent cases.

It emerged today that staff at the under-fire Passport Office have a ‘call-avoidance strategy’ when answering the phone to families worried they will miss their holidays. 

In a Commons statement this morning Mrs May attempted to contain growing public anger over the crisis.

She told MPs: 'Where people have an urgent need to travel, HMPO has agreed to upgrade them - that is their application will be considered in full, it will be expedited in terms of it's processing, printing and delivery - free of charge.'

The Home Secretary acknowledged the concerns of people waiting for passports so they could travel, but cautioned there was no 'big bang, single solution'.

'I understand their anxiety and the Government will do everything it can while maintaining the security of the passport to make sure that people get their passports in time,' she said.

'These changes will allow us to free up a significant number of trained HMPO officials to concentrate on other applications. In addition, HMPO will increase the number of examiners and call handlers by a further 200 staff.' 

Fed-up families left on hold to the Passport Office call centre have vented their frustration on social media

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg suggested that the surge in passport applications was become more people could now afford to go on holiday.

Mr Clegg told LBC 97.3 radio: 'In one sense, it is a great thing that many, many more people appear to be planning to go away on holiday.

'Maybe that's a sign of people feeling that they have got a bit of extra money in their pocket and can afford to go on a summer holiday this year, the way they didn't last year.'

He added: 'I have a lot of sympathy with people who have sent in their passports and are now worried about whether they are going to get them back in time to go on holiday.'

Mr Clegg confirmed that he had checked that his own family's passports are up to date for a summer getaway.

And he added: 'We must throw every single measure we can at this problem to make sure people's passports are returned quickly.' 

There's no crisis! Mr Cameron went on the defensive yesterday as thousands vented their anger

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, called for an emergency phone number to be set up to help people to get through. 

‘This is an issue that concerns every constituency in the country,’ he told Sky News. ‘And so many examples of individual people who are facing great hardship as a result of this chaotic incompetence.

‘I met a man called Harry who told me that he had to go on holiday with his wife without his six-month-old child because the child's passport was not ready.

‘Now these are real-life examples and they just cannot be dismissed as not being important.

‘This is critically important to people at this time that they're able to get their passports, they've paid a fee and they want to get their passports.’

It emerged that the Passport Office’s call centres, run by private firm Teleperformance UK, has a plan to avoid members of the member who phone them. 

The company took over taking telephone enquiries in February in what could be a five-year contract. 

It includes managing 'contact centre services for general enquiries from the public regarding all passport applications including identity interviews for first time adult applications and Passport Validation Service for businesses'.

In a press release trumpeting the deal in December, the company said it would ‘support HM Passport Office in both its Digital By Default and Call Avoidance strategies’.

The revelation will infuriate people who have been left on hold while trying to track the progress of their passport application.  

Mr Cameron yesterday insisted there was no passports crisis despite admitting tens of thousands of travellers have been hit.

At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron said: ‘The Government has taken action to deal with this problem – not today, but in weeks gone past.

‘We have 250 staff already redeployed to the front line prioritising all outstanding applications, that will allow for an extra 25,000 examinations weekly.’

But Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson said: ‘We are told all is well and under control at the Passport Office, but staff are working a 17-hour day. They are being paid up to £70 an hour overtime for the high-level job of sticking on labels with names and addresses.

‘If that is not evidence of a crisis of mismanagement, I do not know what is.The Government appears to be ignorant of – or plain indifferent to – the problems.’ 

To add to the sense of chaos, the Home Office intervened to over-rule managers who tried to water down security checks to speed up processes.

Staff were told in an internal memo to scrap checks on applicant's addresses, counter-signatories and employment details.

But after fears were raised the secret changes could play into the hands of fraudsters, angry ministers moved to re-impose the checks.

The memo, leaked to the Guardian, was issued to HM Passport Office staff in Liverpool, Durham and Belfast and instructed them to ease some checks in an attempt to speed up turnaround times.

It allowed staff to drop checks on counter-signatories, as well as requirements for evidence of addresses and letters of confirmation from employers and accountants.

The move sparked fears that identity thieves and fraudsters would be able to use stolen documents to apply for a second UK passport in other people's names.

But, in a terse statement, the Home Office then said ministers had not been informed of the briefing note and have demanded that it be rescinded.

A spokesman said: 'Ministers were unaware of this document and have instructed HM Passport Office to withdraw it immediately.' 

Mrs May suggested this morning that the passport office could be stripped of its agency status so ministers could have more control.

'In the medium to long term the answer is not just to throw more staff at the problem, but to make sure HMPO is running as efficiently as possible and is as accountable as possible.

'I have therefore asked the Home Office's permanent secretary Mark Sedwill to conduct two reviews, first to make sure HMPO works as efficiently as possible, with better customer services, better processes and better outcomes.

'And secondly to consider whether HMPO's agency status should be removed so it can be brought into the Home Office, reporting directly to ministers, in line with other parts of the immigration system since the abolition of the UK Border Agency.'
