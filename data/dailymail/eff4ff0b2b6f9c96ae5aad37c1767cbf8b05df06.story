It's a remote-controlled machine which drives like a normal truck - but takes off and lands like a helicopter.

Now the Black Knight Transformer, a 'multicopter' designed for the U.S. military, has been seen in action for the first time.

Advanced Tactics, the company behind the machine, has released a video showing the unmanned transformer flying through the desert.

The Black Knight Transformer, which is capable of both flying and driving, has been show in action for the first time

Advanced Tactics, which were commissioned by the U.S Army to design the machine, released the video showing the transformer on its first flight

The 'multicopter' is seen driving through the desert before the rotors are sprung out for take off

The machine is designed to fly up to 150mph in the air and can be flown using a remote control

In the clip, the eight rotor blades are sprung out for take off, allowing the machine to cruise at up to 150mph in the air. The blades then fold back in while the truck is used for off-road driving.

The transformer was built as part of a U.S. military desire for a 
'multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air 
vehicle/unmanned ground vehicle', according to Pop Science.

Essentially it meets the need of an automobile that can adapt to a variety of situations.

An American government study on medical evacuation concluded that the use of robots in military missions would allow for casualty evacuations in areas and times that manned platforms should not operate in, such as 'zero-zero' weather and contaminated environments.

Once the Black Knight reaches its target, its also possible for the controls to be switched and for it to be driven by a human.

Overall, it reduces the risks involved with many missions. The Black Knight is also designed for cargo delivery.

It also shows how the machine is driven like a normal off-road vehicle

The transformer was tested by the company in February and the video clip showing it in action has now been released

The transformer was built to create 'a multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air vehicle/unmanned ground vehicle'

Advanced Tactics, based in El Segundo, tested the remotely-operated, transforming, flying, driving evacuation vehicle earlier thsi year.

'The U.S. Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory is interested in using the Black Knight vehicle for unmanned cargo resupply missions,' Advanced Tactics chief engineer Rustom Jehangir tells Popular Science.

'They've done work on this in the past with other platforms, such as the Lockheed Martin K-Max, but our platform will be much less expensive.'

The driving components were tested in late 2013, while the flying aspects were tested in February. The video has only just been released.

The U.S. military commissioned the creation of a vehicle that can drive and fly remotely so it can be sent on missions unmanned

It utilizes the vertical take off and landing of a helicopter and couples it with the off road driving capabilities of a truck

The Black Knight Transformer would allow the military to enter and exit dangerous areas without having to send in soldiers

In November, it was reported that U.S. soldiers in combat had made a request for drones that could be launched by hand.

It prompted the Pentagon to commission three dozen micro-drones that resemble birds.

Prioria Robotics of Florida announced at the time the US Army Rapid Equipping Force, or REF, awarded them $4.5 million in federal contracts to deliver to the Department of Defense 36 models of the company’s Maveric unmanned aerial vehicle by December.

The Advanced Tactics Black Knight Transformer - reportedly the world's largest 'multicopter' - has been designed for autonomous casualty evacuation and manned or unmanned cargo resupply missions

Creators Advanced Tactics tested the transformer's flight earlier this year

Each Maveric can soar through the sky at speeds up to 55 knots and has the ability to offer soldiers an array of advantageous features.

Each aircraft weighs roughly two-and-a-half pounds, and according to the Army News Service, the Maveric's flexible wings help enable the UAV to blend into its surroundings.

Then in December, the army successfully tested a futuristic laser weapon capable of shooting football-sized mortar rounds.

In November, the Pentagon ordered 36 drones known as 'Mavericks' that could be hand launched and were fitted with cameras for reconnaissance missions

During tests, a 'quarter-sized' invisible
 laser beam successfully targeted and destroyed more than 90 incoming 
mortar rounds and six to seven unmanned drones.

The truck-mounted weapon, known as the High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD), gives a hint at what a weapon of the future could look like.

Using an invisible laser beam to exact targets, the rounds are capable of taking down drones from the sky and even missiles.

Terry Bauer, the project manager for the laser program, told ABC News the test results were 'above and beyond' what they had expected going into the testing. 

'We had no thoughts that this 10-kilowatt would be as successful in doing that as it has been,' he said.

Mortars are common battlefield weapons that are hard to protect against because they can be fired from short distances.

The mortars used in the test were standard 60 millimeter rounds – the length of a football — fired from a distance of less than two kilometers in salvos of two to three mortar rounds each. 

The laser’s success rate against incoming mortar shells indicates that battlefield protection from the small explosive rounds could be possible in a few years.
