McLaren Group chairman Ron Dennis has promised he will announce his 2015 driver line-up before the end of the season.

Current drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen are in limbo as Dennis assesses the market to see who might be available.

Although linked with Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel, both men are under contract to Ferrari and Red Bull respectively, and Dennis has previously stated he is a man who respects agreements.

On track: But Jenson Button is facing a fight to save his McLaren seat with Ron Dennis assessing his options 

One situation he is keeping an eye on is that at Mercedes as former driver Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg go head to head.

With Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff also suggesting one or others could be out of a job if they cross the line in future, in the wake of their collision at Spa, that has placed Dennis on alert.

McLaren are ready to offer him an escape route. They and Honda, their engine partners of next season, want a marquee signing to end a period of decline at the team. Button, who is 34 and thought by the McLaren hierarchy to be small fractions short of fast enough, could well make way.

For now, Dennis maintains he does not know who will be behind the wheel in 2015, but insists an answer will be delivered come the conclusion to the season in Abu Dhabi in late November.

'We always have the best available drivers,' said Dennis.

'Without being derogatory, detrimental or negative to your existing drivers, the first thing you have to establish, before you have any process of selection, is who is available.

'No-one could have predicted the tension inside Mercedes-Benz, or imagine a range of scenarios that could see one of those drivers on the market by the end of the year.

'That does not mean we would automatically reach for that driver, or any other driver, in preference to what we have.

'What it means is you are trying to understand who is available, and then you make a decision. It could be that decision is not to change.

'That's because stability, as we go into the relationship with Honda (power unit supplier from 2015), has huge value, and loyalty is very important to me too.

'So as for a decision, it certainly won't be in the next few days, and it won't be at the end of the season, it will be something in between.'

Dennis insists Button and Magnussen are in the loop as to his plans, adding: 'I am a huge fan of both Kevin and Jenson - Kevin has done an amazing job.

'We are delighted with our drivers, and I have apologised to Jenson for the distracting elements of where we are at the moment.

'But we've always tried to understand driver availability, and at this moment there is no decision to take.

'All I'm doing is making Kevin and Jenson completely aware the best thing they can do is their best job and not get distracted by the whole thing. There is nothing to be distracted by.'

Dennis has confirmed, though, Honda are involved in the selection process.

It has long been understood Honda are driving McLaren to recruit an A-list name for their return to F1 after what will be a seven-year absence.

'We would not, for one minute, not involve them in the decision, but the decision is ours,' said Dennis.
