David Cameron today revealed he would demand 'more control' of Britain's borders to restrict European immigration – in 'one last go' at staying in the EU.

The Prime Minister said he would unveil further benefit restrictions for migrants and block free movement for workers from new countries joining the EU.

But Mr Cameron - speaking in Rochester ahead of next month's by-election sparked by the defection of rebel backbencher Mark Reckless to Ukip - added that he would push for 'further action' on migration as Britain's price for staying in the EU.

Mr Cameron promised to 'bring immigration under control'. He said that would take 'action outside the European Union' – but also much tougher Brussels restrictions.

He said: 'It means some action inside the European Union, including things like use of the benefits system, including making sure that when new countries join they can't all come here which is what happened when Labour were in Government.

'But, also, further action in addition to that to make sure we have more effective control on migration. It's not going to be easy.'

Mr Cameron said winning concessions from Brussels would not be easy. 

But he said: 'Frankly, I think that Britain can say, as a country that has contributed massively to European prosperity and progress, not just in the last few years but over centuries, that we should have one last go at negotiating a better deal.'

The PM's remarks come amid reports he is ready to campaign to leave the EU if they do not agree to his demands to curb migration.

Nigel Farage suffered a setback in Brussels today after his political group in the European Parliament was dissolved.

EU rules require groups to have at least 25 MEPs from at least seven of the EU's 28 member states.

Until today, Mr Farage's Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group qualified with 48 MEPs from seven countries.

Latvian MEP Iveta Grigule was the grouping's only Latvian MEP and her decision to quit the EFDD brought the number of nationalities represented down to six.

Mr Farage blamed Ms Grigute's departure on pressure from European Parliament president Martin Schulz and the chairman of the main centre-right EPP grouping, Manfred Weber. 

The Ukip leader said his group's MEPs had been 'systematically excluded' from positions in the European Parliament.

Mr Farage said the EU was like 'a banana republic'.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Cameron and his party were 'in a complete blind panic' and a 'total flap' about Ukip.

He told LBC Radio: 'No Conservative has put any proposals to me, they haven't breathed a word of this within Government. The Conservative Party has got a fundamental problem. They are running after Ukip in a complete panic.' 

He added that the Conservatives would 'become interchangeable with Ukip' if they continued with the tactic. Mr Clegg said: 'This constant shilly-shallying, where every week they say, 'We'll edge a little bit closer to Ukip', I think is a disastrous political strategy.

The Prime Minister told MPs yesterday that he plans to set out 'all those issues' that will form the basis of Britain's demands 'in the months ahead'.

Senior ministers are pushing for an 'emergency brake' on immigration from the Continent. The system would allow the UK to impose a block on incomers from particular countries if numbers become too big is being backed by key Conservative figures.

At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron's former leadership rival David Davis asked: 'Will the Prime Minister tell us his intentions as bringing to this House the red line issues that will feature in his renegotiation and can he give us a preview of some of those issues today?'

Mr Cameron said Britain's demands would include 'safeguards for the single market, the ability to block new regulation, making sure Britain comes out of ever closer union, and crucially as I said in my conference speech, we have to address the issues of immigration'.

'I am looking forward to addressing all of those issues in the months ahead,' the Prime Minister added.

The Prime Minister's Official Spokeswoman would not confirm any details of the reported plan this morning, saying no 'final decisions' had been taken.

A Number 10 spokeswoman said Mr Cameron had 'already been clear that he recognises people have concerns about migration from the EU and that he intends to address these as part of reforming our relationship with the EU.'

She added: 'He said that in the House yesterday and he said more on it in his conference speech. So there's speculation out there about how and what the Prime Minister will do on that, no final decisions have been taken.'

Conservative ministers want fundamental reform of the EU's founding principle of free movement, which allows people to move between countries, Government sources say.

They are proposing new rules to apply to all new member states ensuring that their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed.

The change would be designed to eliminate the overwhelming economic pull for people to move from poor countries to richer ones. 

Anna Firth is one of two women vying to be the Tory candidate in the Rochester and Strood by-election

Britain's immigration system is not 'sensible' and should be restricted to those with skills not 'fruit pickers in Romania', according to one of the Tory candidates in Rochester.

Former barrister Anna Firth, one of the two women vying to be the next MP, called for an Australian-style points system for all migrants, including those within the European Union.

Her inflammatory comments - at a meeting for local residents from which the national media was excluded - go far further than what is currently Conservative party policy, and are in line with Ukip's immigration policy.

In a hustings in the town on Wednesday evening, Mrs Firth said only migrants with 'skills we need' such as brain surgeons should be allowed to settle in the UK.

Britain has a points-based system for immigrants from outside the EU, but Mrs Firth, who is running against local businesswoman Kelly Tolhurst, said the same criteria should apply within Europe as well.

According to a recording of the meeting, she said: 'I think we need the same immigration system that we have, the five points system, which currently applies to people coming to this country from outside the EU. 

'We need the same system to apply to those who come to this country from inside the EU.

'Once we have that system in place then I think we will have a sensible immigration policy. One that says if you come to this country with skills we really need – say you’re a brain surgeon or something in Australia as opposed to someone who has no skills, a fruit picker in Romania – then we say yes.

'If you come into this country with a job, we say yes. If you come into this country because you’ve got the money to support you and contribute to this country, we say yes. But otherwise need to say we can’t support you. That would be my policy.'

Her comments illustrate the pressure David Cameron is under to secure fundamental reform to the principle of free movement between EU member states during his renegotiation of Britain's membership if he wins the next election.
