The girlfriend of a Texas man who was aboard the missing Malaysian Airlines plane has revealed how she anxiously waited at their home in China for the flight that never arrived.

Sarah Bajc, who is also an American expat, said the desperate wait for information about her long-term boyfriend Philip Wood was 'one of the most painful things I have ever had to go through'.

She had sent a car to Beijing Airport to collect Wood, who worked in Beijing for IBM, as he returned from a trip visiting family in Texas. As she waited, she tracked his journey on the airline's website.

'The online site tracker through 
Malaysia Airlines said it was just delayed; that it took off on time but
 that it hadn't landed,' Bajc, 48, told CBS News.

'Then I looked at the online news, and there was 
the news that the plane was missing. The lack of consistency of information has been incredibly 
frustrating and confusing.'

She
 persevered and found a press release saying the airport had lost 
contact with the plane and that loved ones should call a number, which 
she tried 'on and off for several hours'.

'Finally
 they contacted me since I was listed as next of kin, and they were able
 to tell me nothing other than the fact that they lost contact,' she continued.

'I 
queried them about the various news reports that I'd seen online, first 
there was a reported landing, then there was a reported wreckage, then 
the oil spill and the passports, and they literally cannot confirm any 
of it.'

But Bajc, who was 
hoping to move to Kuala Lumpur with Wood, 50, in the near future as he 
relocated for a new assignment with IBM, said she was glad that they did
 not respond to these speculations.

Family: Wood is pictured with his two sons, Chris and Nick, who said 'odds are' they won't see him again

Sadness: The men said they accepted they might never see Wood again but that they would always hold hope

Heartbroken: Wood's father broke down as he recounted his son's love of travel and 'big heart'

'The rest of the news media and social 
media that keep pushing out this false information are really making 
this an awful roller coaster for those involved,' she said.

But Bajc added that knowing nothing about the flight gave her hope.

'I'm personally not willing to 
give up hope that there's a chance we'll find survivors, that we'll find
 the plane,' she said. 'There just has to be a chance.'

Wood was one of three 
Americans who were aboard the Boeing 777 when it lost contact with air 
traffic control on its way from Kuala Lumpur to 
Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew members.

It isn't known with 
whom the other two Americans, Nicole Meng, 4, and Yan Zhang, 2, were 
traveling.

The wreckage has 
still not been located. Reports on Monday indicated that five passengers
 had checked in but never boarded the plane and that several passengers 
were using stolen passports.

Lost: Philip Wood, from Texas, is among the passengers aboard a Malaysian Airlines plane that vanished

Missed: He was excited about moving to Kuala Lumpur on a new work assignment, relatives said

Malaysia's civil aviation chief said that the search for the Boeing 777 had failed to find anything and that a sighting of a yellow object, which was earlier suspected to have been a life raft, was found to be a false alarm.

Woods, who is divorced, has two sons, Chris and Nick, who said they do not know if they'll ever see their father again.

'I'll never really give up hope, but that doesn't mean that I won't accept that he won't come back,' one said, Good Morning America reported. 'We may not ever see him again, and odds are we won't. I'll be able to come to terms with that.'

Wood's brothers also revealed their grief over the lack of news - but said prayer was getting them through.

One brother, James Wood, told the Associated Press from the Dallas suburb of Keller, Texas, that Wood was supposed to make the final arrangements in China before his relocation to Malaysia.

'This was going to be his last trip to Beijing. It just happened to be this one,' James Wood said.

Where did it go? The plane vanished from radar on Saturday morning as it flew from Malaysia to Beijing

'There is a shock, a very surreal moment in your life. Last Sunday, we were all having breakfast together. And now, you can't.'

James Wood described his brother, a technical storage executive at IBM Malaysia, as an 'outgoing, gregarious, friendly, loving man' who was excited about his upcoming move.

'He loved to travel while he was over there. His job gave him the opportunity to do that,' he said.

He said that his brother is 
divorced and that one of his sons attends Texas A&M University and 
that another previously graduated from that college.

He added that, along with his brother, members of hundreds of other families were on Flight MH370.

'I just wanted to say to all the other families that are around the world: We're hurting. We know you're hurting just as much, and we're praying for you,' he said.

The family has been contacted by the U.S. Department of State and the embassy in Malaysia.

A second brother, Tom Wood, said the events have left 'a real hole in our family,' but he said they aren't giving up hope.

'You never know,' he said. 'I'm not gonna close that door until we need to close it completely.'

So far, no explanation as to what happened to the plane is available. There was no distress signal before the plane vanished from the radar.

The family said they are watching CNN, BBC and other news stations, waiting for small pieces of information on anything about the missing plane.

But, 'with a situation like this, when a plane just disappears ... it leaves you with a lot of questions,' he said.
