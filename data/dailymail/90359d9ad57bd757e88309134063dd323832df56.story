Exeter Chiefs have handed lock forward Jerry Sexton, the younger brother of Ireland fly-half Johnny, a 14-week trial.

The 21-year-old has until the end of November to win himself a full-time deal with the Aviva Premiership club.

Another Sexton: Jerry Sexton was released by French side Auch but will hope to earn a deal with Exeter

Sexton had hoped to remain in France after one season with Pro D2 side Auch, but failed to agree a new contract.

'My agent told me there was an opportunity to come to Exeter on trial because Dean Mumm was injured and that there was a possible place available,' he said.

'We sent the video across, the coaches had a look and now they've offered me a chance until November, so we'll see where it goes from there.'

Success: Johnny Sexton has had an illustrious club and country career with Leinster, Racing Metro and Ireland

Jerry Sexton followed his elder brother Johnny's lead in moving to France last summer, with the British and Irish Lions star still plying his trade at Racing Metro.

The younger Sexton sibling revealed his vastly-experienced brother had urged him to take his chance with the Devon club.

'After Ireland Under-20s I was supposed to go to London Irish Academy on a three-year deal, but that fell through and then I went to France for a year and really enjoyed it,' he said.

'I was supposed to go back again this year, but then I had a problem with my contract so I ended up back home and then the trial with Exeter came up.

'I'm looking forward to it, my brother said the coaches here are very good and that there are no superstars within the squad.

'Already you can see the club is all about hard work and that's what I aim to do and hopefully get a chance to play.'
