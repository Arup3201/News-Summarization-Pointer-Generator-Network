An Afghan man has been granted asylum in Britain because of his ‘human right’ to religion - despite him being an atheist.

He came to Britain six years ago and since then has abandoned his Muslim faith. Now the Home Office have granted him refugee status, because he says he will face persecution if sent home.

His lawyers say it is the first time anyone has been given asylum on religious grounds who is an atheist.

The case was prepared by Kent Law Clinic, which is staffed partly by students studying law courses at the University of Kent’s Law School.

Clinic Solicitor, Sheona York said: 'We are absolutely delighted for our client. We also want to welcome the prompt and positive response of the Home Office.

‘We believe that this is the first time that a person has been granted asylum in this country on the basis of their atheism.

‘The decision represents an important recognition that a lack of religious belief is in itself a thoughtful and seriously-held philosophical position.’

The 21-year-old man came to Britain in 2007 when he was just 16 years old to escape a conflict involving his family, during which his family home was attacked.

He was brought up as a Muslim but since arriving in the UK he ‘gradually turned to atheism’, his lawyers say.

After arriving in Britain, he attended church to ‘see if Christianity had any meaning for him’.

But legal documents submitted as part of his case state: ‘After a while, he realised that it did not and that he had no religious beliefs.’

His lawyers argued that if he was returned to the war-torn country, he could face the death sentence.

Under Sharia law, he is regarded as an ‘apostate’, because he has renounced Islam. In some Islamic countries, including Afghanistan, this can result in a death sentence.

His lawyers argued that he would be forced to remain discreet about his atheist beliefs if he went back - and was bound to be discovered.

‘In Afghanistan, and even in Kabul, life is lived in such a way that everyone is connected with everyone else. There is no sense of privacy, and his lack of religious beliefs would become very quickly known,’ they argued.

They argued that because every aspect of daily life and culture in Afghanistan is influenced by Islam, living discreetly would be ‘virtually impossible’.

His application was brought under the 1951 Refugee Convention, which protects asylum seekers who could face religious persecution, political oppression, torture or other ill treatment.

The lawyers argued the man - who has not been named - would face persecution on the grounds of religion.

It also applies, they argued, to anyone who needed protection because of their lack of religious belief.

Claire Splawn, a second year law student at the university, worked on the case.

She said: ‘We argued that an atheist should be entitled to protection from persecution on the grounds of their belief in the same way as a religious person is protected.’

In February 2006, an Afghan national, Abdul Rahman was arrested and threatened with the death penalty because he converted to Christianity.

He was imprisoned but - following political pressure on Afghan President Hamid Karzai from the US and elsewhere - he was released.

The prosecution case against him was dropped on technical grounds, after a psychological examination concluded he was mentally unfit to stand trial. He was eventually granted asylum in Italy.
