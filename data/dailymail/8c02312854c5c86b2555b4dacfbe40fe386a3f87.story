Stoke City manager Mark Hughes has confirmed his club's interest in signing Chelsea winger Victor Moses on a permanent deal after an impressive loan spell at the Britannia Stadium.

Moses has turned out 19 times for the Potters this season since moving from London on a year-long deal in August - and the Nigerian scored the winner from the spot against Aston Villa last week.

And now Hughes wants £8million-rated Moses to become a permanent part of his squad this summer - or to at least extend his loan for another season.

'Victor is still a Chelsea player, we're very pleased with what he's producing,' Hughes said on Friday. 'We have given him the opportunity and he's in a good place.

'We'd ideally love to be able to take him if we can but that won't be our decision. Things have to fall in place but if there was an opportunity to bring Victor next season we'd love to do it.

'It will be discussed at the end of the season, we will see how far it can go. But his profile is being raised so it is a two-edged sword.

Moses has made just 43 appearances since signing from Wigan Athletic in the summer of 2012 and spent last season on loan at Liverpool with little success.

And Hughes suggested that Moses, who has emerged as one of the stars of a good season for Stoke, might not get the chance to play in a side that already boasts the likes of Eden Hazard, Willian and January signing Juan Cuadrado.

'Would he get the opportunity his talents deserve back at Chelsea?' Hughes questioned. 'We like to think we would be a consideration for him almost certainly.'

The Nigerian winger has found opportunities limited at Chelsea which could add to the appeal of Stoke
