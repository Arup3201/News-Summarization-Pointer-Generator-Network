After England claimed an impressive 266-run victory against India in the third Test at the Ageas Bowl, Sportsmail's NASSER HUSSAIN runs the rule over how both sets of players rated.

Alastair Cook 9.5 

Just shows what a clear mind and runs can do. Win the toss and bat first. Outstanding from the first ball to the last. Didn’t put a foot wrong.

Sam Robson 4

Struggles outside off stump and as an opener that is a problem. Has to work out what to play and what to leave.

Gary Ballance 9

Brilliant in both innings; trying to set match up in first and going after it in second. Showed he can bat at different tempos. Wouldn’t have been given out in either innings with DRS.

Stellar outing: It all went right for Alastair Cook in Southampton with England ending their search for a Test win

Ian Bell 9

Brilliant return to form in first innings. Left the ball better outside off stump early and gave England the required tempo in absence of KP, giving his side chance to bowl India out twice.

Joe Root 7

Excellent second innings in one-day mode, selflessly going after runs quickly. Useful wicket and outstanding fielding. Has a great attitude.

Moeen Ali 9

Remarkable six-wicket haul against India. There are some great spinners who haven’t done that. No longer a part-timer. Has worked hard on the pace he needs to bowl and it’s paying off.

Six of the best:  Moeen Ali (right) celebrates taking the wicket  of Bhuvneshwar Kumar

Jos Buttler 9

Had a little bit of luck in his first innings but he made India pay with a superb aggressive innings. His glove-work impressed me even more on a spinning wicket. Outstanding debut.

Chris Woakes 6

Did not bowl badly and I would look to keep him in the squad. If Anderson isn’t available next week, England need a swing bowler like Woakes.

Chris Jordan 4

Hasn't been helped by being left out and then brought back in. Needs to be playing because he’s completely lost his rhythm. Took a brilliant catch and didn’t let his head drop.

Safe hands: Chris Jordan caught both Shikhar Dhawan and Cheteshewar Pujar (above) in the slips

Stuart Broad 8

Great hostile bowling without being too short. Some of the short balls he did bowl nipped back in and caused serious issues. Back to his best and looked like he enjoyed himself.

James Anderson 9.5

His control of line, length and swing and the way he set up players like Dhawan was world-class. Delivered when his captain needed him. 

Mr Reliable: James Anderson, who faces a possible suspension, was at his immaculate best

Total 84/110

Murali Vijay 5

Played nicely in the first innings until he dragged one on. A good player but a dopey run out in second with no real dive will have made Duncan Fletcher cross.

Shikhar Dhawan 5

Has a problem with Anderson bowling around the wicket. Has worked with Fletcher to change his alignment but his technique, staying so leg side, looks vulnerable in England. Place under threat from Gautam Gambhir.

Don't look back: Skikhar Dhawan is caught by Jordan off the bowling of Anderson

Cheteshwar Pujara 4

Another couple of soft dismissals. He got a good ball in the first innings from Broad but he needs to knuckle down and get back to his best.

Virat Kohli 5.5

Looks vulnerable outside off stump. Got himself in twice but he has been playing the shot of the day rather than the innings of the day. That is a big difference.

Ajinkya Rahane 8

Played really well in both innings. People talk about Pujara looking like Rahul Dravid but I think Rahane is more like him. Very organised and in good nick.

The little wall: Ajinkya Rahane hit half centuries in both innings at the Ageas Bowl

Rohit Sharma 4

Don't have a problem with him hitting down the ground because too many Indian batsmen were passive against Moeen Ali. But he needs to commit fully to the shot and it didn’t work for India playing the extra batsman.

MS Dhoni 6

Captained the side well and batted nicely in the first innings. At times his glove-work looked a little bit sloppy in comparison to Buttler. Might think about the balance of the side.

Ravindra Jadeja 6 

Couple of soft dismissals. Bowled OK but too quickly to really find the rough. Orthodox left-arm spinners go up and down to land it in the rough but Jadeja is constantly trying to fire it in.

And that's out: Ravindra Jadeja is bowled by Ali on day five as India crumble to defeat

Bhuvneshwar Kumar 6

Not at his best but he still bowled pretty well. Pitched the ball up and swung it and produced a couple of really good deliveries. Looked a little short of pace.

Mohammed Shami 4

Thought he’d be bowling better than this in the series. In the absence of Ishant Sharma he needed to stand up more and take more responsibility but it didn’t happen. Will be looking over his shoulder.

Pankaj Singh 4

Poor lad. He’ll bowl a lot worse and take wickets. Had Cook dropped, Ballance not given and Bell lbw turned down. Nice to see a genuine No 11 back in Test cricket!

Total 57.5/110
