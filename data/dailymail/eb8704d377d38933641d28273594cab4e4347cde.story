Holder says drone strikes in the U.S. on American citizens are hypothetically possible, but only in extreme circumstances

Attorney General Eric Holder says the U.S. Government could kill Americans on their home soil using drone strikes.

He did not rule out potential scenarios where a drone could target an American in the U.S., but said it has not happened so far and only in the most extreme of circumstances could he ever see it being considered.

His comments came in testimony yesterday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican, Texas, asked Holder whether he believed it would be constitutional to target an American terror suspect who was simply 'sitting at a cafe' .

'No,' Holder replied, calling the use of domestic drone strikes 'entirely hypothetical' and adding that the government has no intention of carrying out drone strikes against its own citizens.

His comments
 come in the wake of Senator Rand Paul demanding that he or the 
president or issue a statement assuring the unmanned aircraft would not 
be used in the United States to kill American terrorism suspects as part
 of his 13 hour filibuster blocking the nomination of John Brennan as 
director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Paul
 started just before noon Wednesday by demanding the president or 
Attorney General Eric Holder issue a statement assuring the unmanned 
aircraft would not be used in the United States to kill terrorism 
suspects who are U.S. citizens.

He wasn't picky about the format, saying at one point he'd be happy with a telegram or a Tweet.

The Obama administration has said the
 federal government has not conducted such operations inside U.S. 
borders and has no intention of doing so.

Paul said he recognized that he can't
 stop Brennan from being confirmed. But the nomination was the right 
vehicle for a debate over what the Obama White House believes are the 
limits of the federal government's ability to conduct lethal operations 
against suspected terrorists, he said.

The Attorney General's comments came after Senator Rand Paul made a 13 hour filibuster against John Brennan being appointed director of the CIA

Paul, 50, received intermittent 
support early on from several other conservative senators holding 
similar views, plus Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. He spoke 
almost continuously for five hours before Majority Leader Harry Reid 
tried but failed to move to a vote on Brennan.

Paul snacked on candy at the dinner 
hour while continuing to speak. At one point, Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., 
who walks haltingly with a cane because of a stroke, delivered a 
canister of hot tea and an apple to Paul's desk, but a doorkeeper 
removed them.

Rep. Louie Gohmert, a conservative from Texas, stood off 
to the side of the Senate floor in a show of support. Other well-wishers
 with privileges to be on the floor shook his hand when he temporarily 
turned the speaking over to his colleagues.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, read Twitter 
messages from people eager to 'Stand With Rand.' The Twitterverse, said 
Cruz, is 'blowing up.' And as the night went on, Cruz spoke for longer 
periods as Paul leaned against a desk across the floor. Cruz, an 
insurgent Republican with strong tea party backing, read passages from 
Shakespeare's 'Henry V' and lines from the 1970 movie 'Patton,' starring
 George C. Scott.

Dressed in a dark suit, white shirt 
and red tie, Paul read from notebooks filled with articles about the 
expanded use of the unmanned weapons that have become the centerpiece of
 the Obama administration's campaign against al-Qaida suspects. As he 
moved about the Senate floor, aides brought him glasses of water, which 
he barely touched. Senate rules say a senator has to remain on the floor
 to continue to hold it, even though he can yield to another senator for
 a question.

Drones, unarmed craft that carry missiles, are a key weapon in the U.S. War on Terror

'No president has the right to say he is judge, jury and executioner,' Paul said.

Not all Republicans were so 
enthusiastic about Paul's performance. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said
 the prospect of drones being used to kill people in the United States 
was 'ridiculous' and called the debate 'paranoia between libertarians 
and the hard left that is unjustified.'

Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., the 
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, echoed Graham. He said it 
is unconstitutional for the U.S. military or intelligence agencies to 
conduct lethal counterterrorism operations in the United States against 
U.S. citizens. Suggesting they can or might, Rogers said, 'provokes 
needless fear and detracts attention from the real threats facing the 
country.'

The President, if the circumstances arose, could theoretically launch a drone strike on a U.S. citizen on American soil

Later in the evening Paul, who is the 
son of former Texas congressman and libertarian leader Ron Paul, offered
 to allow a vote on Brennan if the Senate would vote on his resolution 
stating that the use of the unmanned, armed aircraft on U.S. soil 
against American citizens violates the Constitution. Democrats rejected 
the offer.

Reid, D-Nev., said he planned to file a
 motion to bring debate over Brennan's nomination to an end, if not on 
Thursday, then Friday or next week. Reid had pushed for a confirmation 
vote Wednesday. Technically, the Senate had not even started the debate 
on Brennan's nomination before Paul took control of the floor almost 
immediately after Republicans successfully blocked a vote on a federal 
appeals court nominee.

Along with Cruz and Wyden, Republican 
Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Marco Rubio of Florida
 joined Paul briefly three hours into the debate but turned it back to 
him. Wyden has long pressed for greater oversight of the use of drones. 
Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., appeared later in the evening to trade 
questions with Paul.

The record for the longest individual 
speech on the Senate floor belongs to former Sen. Strom Thurmond of 
South Carolina, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the
 Civil Rights Act of 1957.

Holder came close to making the 
statement Paul wanted earlier in the day during an exchange with Cruz at
 a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, according to Paul.

Cruz asked Holder if the Constitution 
allowed the federal government to kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil who 
doesn't pose an imminent threat. Holder said the situation was 
hypothetical, but he did not think that in that situation the use of a 
drone or lethal force would be appropriate. Cruz criticized Holder for 
not simply saying 'no' in response.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Paul, Brennan said the CIA does not have authority to conduct lethal operations inside the U.S.

Holder told Paul in a March 4 letter 
that the federal government has not conducted such operations and has no
 intention of doing so. But Holder also wrote that he supposed it was 
possible under an 'extraordinary circumstance' that the president would 
have no choice but to authorize the military to use lethal force inside 
U.S. borders. Holder cited the attacks at Pearl Harbor and on Sept. 11, 
2001, as examples.

Paul said he did not dispute that the 
president has the authority to take swift and lethal action against an 
enemy that carried out a significant attack against the United States. 
But Paul said he was 'alarmed' at how difficult it has been to get the 
administration to clearly define what qualifies as a legitimate target 
of a drone strike.

Brennan's nomination won approval 
Tuesday by the Senate Intelligence Committee after the White House broke
 a lengthy impasse by agreeing to give lawmakers access to top-secret 
legal opinions justifying the use of lethal drone strikes against 
al-Qaida suspects overseas.

If confirmed, Brennan would replace 
Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy director who has been acting director 
since David Petraeus resigned in November after acknowledging an affair 
with his biographer.

Brennan currently serves as Obama's 
top counterterrorism adviser in the White House. He was nominated for 
the CIA post by the president in early January and the Intelligence 
Committee held his confirmation hearing on Feb. 7.Â
