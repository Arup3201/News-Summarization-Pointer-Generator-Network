Three people are dead and 31 are missing after a Quebec nursing home burned to the ground early Thursday morning.

Flames engulfed the 52-unit complex in L’Isle Verte, about 140 miles north of Quebec City. Three are confirmed dead, but officials fear the death toll will rise as only five of the home’s residence did not require round-the-clock care.

A further 20 people were rescued from the inferno that saw flames shooting several stories into the air as firefighters battled extreme temperatures dropping below zero.

Tragic: Three are dead and more than 30 missing as a result of the raging fire

'A night in hell': A local fire chief called the combination of raging flames and bitter cold hellish

‘A night of hell,’ ‘Fire Chief Yvan Charron told Dimanche.

Authorities spoke Thursday of the grim reality now facing the tiny town of just over 1,500 people.

‘About 31 people are on the list of people that Quebec police are looking for. This is very bad news because they have challenges moving around. It is very bad news,’ said Francois Lapointe, the member of Parliament for the area.

‘We're down to hoping that some of those 31 people were not there.’

The majority of the unaccounted for people are confined to wheelchairs and walkers, some of them have Alzheimer’s disease, acting mayor Ginette Caron added.

Engulfed: The nursing homes west wing was completely engulfed in flames and burned to the ground.

Killer inferno: The fire is confirmed to have taken three lives

Haunting: A neighbor told media he watched a man try in vain to save his mother's life, he instead watched her burn to death

‘These are elderly, some of which are very limited mobility,’ Mr Charron added. ‘Others were afraid and they hid under blankets.’

Mario Michaud, who lives across from the scorched nursing home, told Dimanche of the horror he witnessed after waking up just before 12:30 a.m.

‘I saw smoke. The fire started on the second floor… I saw the fire fighters,’ he said. ‘A woman on the second floor was shouting and she went out on to the balcony. Her son went to get a ladder but he couldn't get to her. She burned to death.

‘Her boy, he broke down.’ He added to the Globe and Mail. ‘It wasn’t pretty.’

No escape: Many of the more than 30 residents missing or unaccounted for were infirm and unable to move without a wheelchair or walker, a local official said

Terrifying: Another local said he watched as a woman's balcony caved in - the collapse dragged her from safety and back into the out of control fire

Volunteer fire fighters from at least 20 separate barracks responded to the blaze, according to Dimanche. They had to battle both the towering flames and temperatures plunging to minus five Fahrenheit.

Their efforts were not able to keep the complex from completely burning to the ground.

‘Some are still looking for their parents but we’re certain that our mother has died,’ another local told the Globe and Mail. ‘She was on the balcony and there was too much smoke … the building has collapsed so she’s still in the rubble.’

Authorities have said it will take several hours to sift through the charred building for victims.

Another woman was found wracked with guilt outside the blaze – she had recently placed her parents in the facility.

‘I didn't send my parents to see them burn there,’ Marielle Marquis, the president of a local seniors club, recalled to the Globe and Mail.

Devastating: A firefighter appears to be in disbelief at what he's seeing the day after a fire tore through the nursing home and the water used to fight the blaze formed a thick glaze over the smoldering remains

Bitter cold: Temperatures plunged well below freezing, and howling winds dropped wind chills down to as low as minus-20 Fahrenheit at times

Frosted: The charred remains were covered in ice by sunrise

The 20 residents rescued from the raging fire lived in the complex’s newer east wing, the Globe and Mail reported. It had a firewall that blocked the flames from reaching them.’

The building’s older wing touts an automatic sprinkler system on its website, but official filings show it has only partial sprinklers, according to the Globe and Mail.

The facility was first opened in 1997, according to the Montreal Gazette.

A cause has not yet been determined.

Canada’s Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a statement on the tragedy.

'On behalf of the entire country, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of those who passed away following the fire at a seniors’ residence in eastern Quebec last night,’ he said.

‘My thoughts and prayers are also with those who remain unaccounted for and all those who have been injured.’

Quebec Premier Pauline Marois offered her condolences from Davos, Switzerland.

‘I want to extend my condolences to all the families affected by this terrible fire,’ she said. ‘I have been in touch with my office and we are doing everything we can to support the community and families.

‘It’s a private center but we’re talking about human beings, so we’ll do whatever we can. I am deeply saddened by this event.’

The fire comes just six months after 47 people were killed in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, when a train with 72 oil tankers derailed and exploded in the small community.

A 1969 nursing home fire in the community of Notre-Dame-du-Lac, Quebec, claimed 54 lives.
