The drug seeks out and 'silences' compounds

Doctors are using a type of arthritis drug to treat sciatica - the pain associated with a slipped disc. The drug seeks out and 'silences' compounds involved in inflammation - and early trials show that it can banish pain completely.

Sciatica is caused by irritation and inflammation of the sciatic nerve, the longest nerve in the body, which runs from the back of the pelvis, through the buttocks, and down both legs to the feet.

Sciatica is usually described as a sharp, shooting or burning pain, which radiates down the back towards the foot or ankle.

Most attacks occur when the discs that cushion the bones of the spine begin to bulge or move out of position (known as 'slipping'), pressing on the nerve and triggering inflammation.

Treatments include painkillers, physiotherapy and steroid injections but, in some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the disc. The arthritis drug adalimumab may provide another option. The drug is a man-made version of a type of immune system compound called an antibody.

These are highly targeted molecules programmed by the body to seek out specific bacteria or viruses. Scientists programme the synthetic antibody to target a specific compound in the body called tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF).

Normally, this compound rises shortly after the body is infected with a bug. This increases inflammation and helps mobilise immune system cells to fight the invader.

However - for reasons that are still unknown - in certain so-called autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or the skin condition psoriasis, levels of TNF are permanently high.

This means that the immune system is constantly in a state of high-alert, which may cause the immune cells to malfunction and mistakenly attack healthy cells.

Studies suggest that people with sciatica also have high levels of TNF, which contributes to the pain of the condition.

In one study of 49 sciatica patients at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Australia, around half of the patients who received a similar drug to block TNF had a 100 per cent reduction in leg pain, compared with a placebo.

In a new trial at five hospitals across the UK (in North Wales, Keele, Nottingham, London and Cardiff), 300 patients will receive three injections of the drug adalimumab two weeks apart, or a placebo.

They will also be given regular sessions of physiotherapy, and be monitored for two years.

Commenting on the trial, Jane Tadman, of Arthritis Research UK, the charity that pioneered the use of this therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, says: 'This treatment has transformed the treatment of inflammatory arthritis worldwide.

'It's not a cure, but for those people in whom it does work, the results can be dramatic.

'Sciatica can be caused by inflammation of the sciatic nerve, and TNF is an important molecule in inflammation, so blocking its action could have a big impact.

'Applying anti-TNF to sciatica is a novel approach, and we await the findings of this study with considerable interest.'

Meanwhile, research has linked being overweight with an increased risk of back pain and sciatica.

A new study from scientists at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health - based on more than 300,000 men and women - showed that overweight people had a 23 per cent greater risk of low back pain, and a 12 per cent increased risk of sciatica.

Among the obese, the risk of back pain rose by 40 per cent, and sciatica by 54 per cent.
