A middle school teacher whose skull was shattered three months ago when teens allegedly dropped a 5lb rock from a highway overpass onto her car is finally ready to head home.

Sharon Budd, her relatives and medical staff appeared outside Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania on Tuesday to speak about her incredible battle.

Helped by two staff members, she grinned as she rang a ceremonial victory bell.

The 52-year-old mother and breast cancer survivor plans to return home to Uniontown, Ohio on Wednesday.  

Celebration: Sharon Budd rings a ceremonial victory bell outside Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania on Tuesday - signaling that she is ready to return home after three months

On the road to recovery: Mrs Budd has been recovering for three months after a rock was thrown from an Interstate 80 overpass in Pennsylvania and shattered her skull. She lost her right eye in the incident

When previously asked what was the first thing she wanted when she got home, she told PennLive: 'A loaf of bread and an entire package of English muffins. I'll stand by the toaster for an hour and a half.'  

She was the front-seat passenger of her family's car as it drove through Danville on July 10 with her husband and daughter, when the rock crashed through the front window and struck her head. 

Budd, who had just finished speaking to her son before he was deployed to Afghanistan, suffered a crushed skull and brain damage. She also lost her right eye.

She has endured five surgical procedures to repair the damage - including the removal of a portion of her facial bones to ease the brain swelling - but has suffered setbacks with seizures.

Excitement: Randy Budd speaks to his wife on Tuesday as she prepares to head back home to Ohio

Strength-to-strength: Mrs Budd suffered brain damage but is able to manage simple math, her husband said

Her husband Randy said on Tuesday that her sense of humor has returned, she is able to walk and she has regained limited vision in her left eye. Her long-term prognosis remains uncertain. 

'They told us to look at this a year from now to give a measurement of how Sharon's going to be, who is Sharon going to be,' Randy Budd said. 

She can perform simple math and knows who the president is and that it's 2014, Randy Budd said. But she can be confused about how many children she has or how she got hurt, he said.

'Some basics, she doesn't have,' Randy Budd said. 'That's to be expected. The brain has to reconnect itself.' 

But there are encouraging signs so far, he said: 'She could have come back bitter, violent, aggressive, but she came back as kind of her sweet self.'

She rang a ceremonial victory bell Tuesday at Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital, and then started the five-hour drive west to Uniontown, Ohio, where friends and neighbors will greet her.

'This word gets thrown around a lot, but I really believe the angels came down to help her,' he said. 

Four young men face charges in the attack.

One of them testified at a preliminary hearing in August that they set out to do damage that day, starting with shoplifting and driving through a corn field and ending up on the Interstate 80 overpass shortly before midnight.

Keefer McGee, 18, testified under a deal with prosecutors that they laughed as they drove away from the scene after hearing the noise of the rock hitting the Budd family's vehicle.

'They weren't looking for a car to hit in particular,' said McGee, who told the judge he had been involved in unspecified earlier rock-throwing incidents. 'Like, they weren't waiting for one. They hit one as they saw it.' 

He drove them back to the Lahr home, where they began to watch a movie before deciding to return to the scene to see what happened — twice. During one of those trips, an alert police officer noted their license plate, leading investigators to the four.

Budd's husband Randy recalled the horror of that evening during the hearing. 

'It felt like an explosion,' he testified, calling his wife's injuries the 'most gruesome thing that I've ever seen.'

'I'm pretty sure I was looking at brains and skull and she, remarkably, kind of came to but wasn't saying anything,' he said. 'She was just jerking, grabbing her head, so we were holding her hands down.'  

Accused: Brett Lahr, 18, left, and his brother, 17-year-old Dylan Lahr, and two others have been charged with aggravated assault and conspiracy charges in the shocking incident three months ago

One of the four told police that the oblong-shaped rock was dropped by Dylan Lahr, 17.

The lawyer for the only defendant who did not waive his preliminary hearing, Brett Lahr, 19, said this week he was glad to hear Sharon Budd was being released but maintains criminal charges should not have been filed against him.

'Just because you're riding along with people who do some stuff, and even alleged to have laughed if it happened, which we dispute, does not mean you should be even tried for a crime,' said the defense attorney, Brian Manchester. 'You have to have some active involvement.'
