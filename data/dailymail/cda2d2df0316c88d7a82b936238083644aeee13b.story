The depths of Mick Philpott's sexual depravity were revealed today in a sickening prison letter which told how he and his wife planned to celebrate their freedom by 'raping each other' after visiting their children's graves.

Philpott penned the letter to friends Mick and Sharon Russell while awaiting trial for the manslaughter of the six youngsters.

It tells how he intended to get drunk with his wife and accomplice Mairead before 'spending the whole day with our babies at the graveside.'

But in a disturbing conclusion to what should be a time of grief, he continues: 'We don't care if its raining, gale 
force winds, snowing, I'm going straight up there, then we shall 
probably, no, we will, rape each other... then we can all celebrate our 
freedom.'

In the most tasteless way imaginable, the sick words were written with drawings of eight pink hearts, one each for him and his wife and six others for the children they killed.

The godfather to three of Mick Philpott's children today said he felt 'angry and deceived' by his close friend after he was found guilty of killing six of his children in a house fire.

Andrew Allsop, pictured, told ITV's Daybreak: 'He's taken so many lives.

'He's taken my godchild, the other children that called me uncle, my wife auntie. How could I forgive him for doing that.'

'I'm very angry, my whole family is angry. We’ve gone through that much grief with people sort of blaming us because we were friends with him.

'It’s not our fault, we didn’t mean this to happen to the children.

'It's devastating. It's not just we've suffered but lots and lots of people have suffered.'

Mr and Mrs Russell said they were 
shocked by the language used, telling ITV's This Morning programme they 
couldn't believe his mind would be 'craving sex' after visiting 
the graveyard.

Philpott pursued a twisted love life with Mairead and his former live-in partner, Lisa Willis, at the home they shared in Allenton, Derby.

He boasted how he would sleep with the women on alternate nights in a rusting caravan parked outside the house as they tended to his every need.

But the bizarre love triangle fell apart when Miss Willis decided to flee his clutches and took five of their children with her.

That prompted a bitter custody battle which ended with Philpott's appalling attempt to frame her for the fire which killed six of his other children.

Far from being distraught by the tragedy, Mr and Mrs Russell told how Philpott was having a 'laugh and joke' while visiting his 
children's bodies in the mortuary.

On hearing news of the blaze, Mr Russell said: 'I jumped in the car and went
straight down to Mick's mum and I found out where he was, I phoned the 
hospital and said "can I come down" and he said "please come down Mick" 
and we went there.'

When he arrived, he found Philpott not crying, but flirting with his wife.

He said: 'I was walking down the corridor and me and Sharon was in 
front and he was behind us and he said "hey Mick" I looked round and he
was grabbing his girl's bum saying this is what he liked.

'I was 
thinking "you've just lost six kids Mick, what are you doing?"'

On their visit to the mortuary, Mrs Russell said: 'He was crying but there were no tears. Same with Mairead.

Mr Russell added: 'I just burst out crying and Mick just said 'I'll deal with it my own way."'

When it came to the funeral, Mrs Russell said Mairead appeared more concerned about what dress she was going to wear and described the wake as an 'after party'.

Mrs Russell said: 'She was going to wear this certain outfit for the funeral, and I was quite shocked at it and said "you can't wear that".

'She said "will it be alright for the after party?" I was like "the after party, what do you mean an after party?"

'It was disgusting the way they were behaving.'

Mr Russell, who has known Philpott 
for around 20 years, said he never felt comfortable leaving his wife 
alone with the father-of-17 because of his rampant sex drive.

He told This Morning: 'I wouldn't leave Sharon in the room 
with him on his own because he's very highly sex-drived and if he saw a 
pretty woman he'll try and chat her up.'

Mick
said, 'I've known him for about twenty years, and I've been on a number
of programmes to defend him... I just can't believe how he's conned 
me.'

Mrs Russell, who knew the Philpott family for 12 years, said: 'I thought the way he lived was bizarre and he was a very controlling person, very controlling towards Lisa and Marie. He controlled them. He thought they were his property.'

She added: 'The children were happy, but he never took them on outings or anything, or to the park, even to the shops, none of that.

'Those kids were always in the house. And she [Mairead] just did the basic things really for the kids - made sure they were dressed for school, cooked them dinner, but never one to one with the children.'

Mr Russell went on to say how they appeared to enjoy the celebrity status they found themselves in.

He said: 'He loved the fact that everybody knew him. He liked to be well known.'
