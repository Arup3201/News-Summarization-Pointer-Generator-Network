A drag artist who dazzled audiences when he took to the stage as his alter ego Betty Swollocks has been ordered to pay back thousands of pounds in benefits.

Brighton man John Townend cheated nearly £7,000 from the taxpayer during a four-year period after convincing the authorities he had no income.

But on Friday and Saturday nights, the 62-year-old could be found strutting his stuff on the stage of the Poison Ivy bar in the city centre.

Alter ego: John Townend claimed he had no income while working as a drag artist under his stage name of Betty Swollocks

He appeared at Brighton Magistrates’ Court yesterday charged with four counts of dishonestly making a statement he knew to be false for the purpose of obtaining housing and council tax benefit.

The charges related to offences between November 2007 to September 2011. In total he claimed £5,870.76 in housing benefit plus £980.83 in council tax benefit.

He pleaded guilty to all the charges.

Townend - who was summoned to court under his real name and his stage name Betty Swollocks - was earning £25 a night plus free drinks at the Poison Ivy in Brighton. He also worked at the Queen's Arms in the city.

Len Batten prosecuting told the court that Brighton and Hove City Council received a referral in October 2011 as it was suspected that Townend had not declared his income as a ‘cabaret artist called Betty Swollocks’.

Mr Batten said: ‘He said he had no income and was waiting for a redundancy payment. He said he was paid cash-in-hand from May to July 2011.'

He added his client had been expecting a redundancy payment of about £1,200.

Mr
Batten argued the council wrote to the Queen's Arms in George Street, 
Brighton, which provided invoices from April 2007 to September 2011.

All of them were signed by either John Townend or Betty Swollocks.

Townend had a website devoted to his alter ego Betty Swollocks, which has since been removed.

Mr Batten said Townend was interviewed under caution July last year and showed ‘a good understanding of the benefits system’.

He originally said that he had declared his work at the Queen's Arm's, but later retracted his statement, claiming he was confused as to whether he was employed or self-employed.

Details obtained from the Poison Ivy in Brighton showed Townend was paid £25 cash-in-hand on a self-employed basis for performing his act on Friday and Saturday nights. Free drinks were also included in the deal.

Defending, Jenna Threadgold claimed Townend ‘wasn’t aware’ he was committing an offence.

Miss Threadgold said: ‘What he says is that he did have some work, it was sporadic and was only paid £25.

‘He is not someone who is earning a substantial amount of money. He has health problems and didn’t work for eight months.

‘During this time he was homeless and living in hostels. He has been on a very limited income.

‘He was telling someone but he told the wrong organisation. When he went to sign on with the Department of Work and Pensions he did told them when he did a bit of work.

‘He should have been telling the council as well, he thought it was one organisation.’

Miss Threadgold told the court Townend had ‘mobility problems’ and had mobility aids in his home due to having screws in his hips.

She said he has now employed an accountant to help him keep up with his self employment and is ‘remorseful and embarrassed’ about the situation.

The case comes just over a week after another transvestite was jailed after claiming he was disabled and pocketing £88,000 in benefits while performing as the star of a drag act called Glitterlips.

Mark Hawthorne, 49, said he could barely walk and needed around the clock care to help him get out of bed in order to receive disability handouts for almost a decade.

By night, however, he adopted the stage name Aunt Tilly and would strut his stuff in nightclubs to Tina Turner and Diana Ross songs as part of a double act.

He was caught out when fraud investigators discovered a video of him in action in a blonde wig, high heels and a cocktail party dress, which had been uploaded on YouTube and Facebook.

Hawthorne was jailed for six months at Stafford Crown Court after admitting three counts of failing to notify the Department of Work and Pensions of a change of circumstances and two counts of fraud.

Townend, who appeared in court wearing a smart pinstripe suit, has started to pay back the £6,856 he owes at £40 per month for the council tax benefit, and £15 per month for the housing benefit.

He is currently receiving a pension and benefits.

He was handed a community order by magistrates to undertake 120 hours of unpaid work over 12 months. He was also asked to pay £500 prosecution costs. The investigation was said to have cost £1,606.
