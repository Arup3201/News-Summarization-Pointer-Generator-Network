Grecko's ex-fiance believes that bankrupt Edelsten is a 'snake'

Geoffrey Edelsten has well and truly moved on from his ex-wife Brynne.

The 71-year-old stirred up controversy when he stepped out with an even younger lookalike of his former spouse on Monday, as he attended the funeral of VFL great Tom Hafey in Melbourne.

Now the controversial millionaire has spoken out his new busty blonde girlfriend Gabi Grecko, 24, for the first time, telling the Herald Sun that he is smitten.

Smitten: Geoffrey Edelsten says he is smitten with his new girlfriend Gabi Grecko, who is 47 years younger than him and is the spitting image of his ex-wife Brynne

'I’m very much so. She’s delightful. I’m very happy,' he said.

However, the same may not go for his ex Brynne, 31, after Grecko posted an image of her and her new man kissing, hashtagging the snap #brynneedelsten.

And it seems that Grecko's former fiance Kevin Johnn has also been left burnt.

Causing controversy: Geoffrey caused a stir when he rocked up to the funeral of VFL great Tom Hafey on Monday in Melbourne with Grecko who was clad in a revealing Herve Leger dress

The former Project Runway contestant hinted that he and Grecko had never officially finalised the end of their three year relationship, and that the former reality star could not possibly be in love with Edelsten.

He spoke of his concerns for the busty blonde getting involved with the bankrupt millionaire.

'She’s very, very special. A lot of people kinda have her wrong,' he said.

'He (Edelsten) is a huge snake and she’s not stupid. It’s going to be a disaster if she falls for him, and she knows it.'

Happy together: Geoffrey and Brynne are seen cuddling up outside the Crown Casino in a picture that Gabi posted on her Pinterest page

According to Brynne's manager Rob Menzies, his client couldn't care less about the new relationship and that she should not be 'dragged' into the affair.

Meanwhile, Grecko herself has spoken out to defend the revealing outfit she chose to wear to Hafey's funeral.

Speaking about the tight dress with a plunging neckline, she told Nine News: 'I had come here not planning to go to a funeral.'

Selfies: Gabi is a model and a DJ who is based in New York

She added: 'It was a sad thing, this was a really good friend of Geoff's.'

And addressing whether her garment, a $2000 Herve Leger dress, was appropriate for such an occasion, instead of agreeing it was revealing, she appeared to believe she had been the victim of a 'malfunction'.

She said: 'The malfunction with the cleavage … I have several Herve Leger dresses and they fit right.

'The only black one I have was that one.'

With her blonde hair and curvy figure it hasn't gone unnoticed that Gabi bares a striking resemblance to Geoffrey's ex-wife.

Revealing: Gabi is certainly not shy when it comes to her social media postings

However the buxom blonde, who is based in New York, says she can't see it.

'Do I? I don't think we do at all,' she said.

'We have a totally different style … we have a totally different body shape.'

Gabi also appears to enjoy the party scene just like Brynne but perhaps these days are over now she is dating older man Geoffrey.

It's unsure whether this is a serious relationship as this is not the first time he has been spotted with a mystery blond since he and Brynne went their separate ways.
