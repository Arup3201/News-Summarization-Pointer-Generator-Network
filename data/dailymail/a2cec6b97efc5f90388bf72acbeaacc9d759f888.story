Adidas have been criticised by animal rights groups following the release of a new advert promoting the World Cup.

The German sports giants have filmed a host of football's top stars holding a bloody cow's heart in the advert alongside the slogan: 'During the World Cup, I will give my heart to the cause.'

The campaign features Germany's Lukas Podolski, Spain striker Diego Costa, Holland winger Arjen Robben and Brazil defender Dani Alves.

The advert has received negative publicity in Germany with a spokesman from animal rights group Four Paws saying that the advert reflects badly on Podolski and adidas.

'He says he’d give his heart but it wasn’t his heart was it. It was the heart of an innocent animal,' the spokesman said.

'If this was supposed to be some sort of PR stunt, then it misses the point. It’s bad enough that animals are slaughtered for food but to parade a heart, dripping blood and gore, is hardly a good way to advertise a sporting goods firm.'

The image surfaced after appearing on Podolski's Instagram account, but he has defended his decision to take part in the ad.

He said: 'I don’t find it disgusting. It just shows my promise to give my heart in our bid to win the World Cup. I and the rest of the team will give it all for Germany.'

Podolski recently starred in another adidas advert alongside Arsenal and Germany team-mate Mesut Ozil and Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller where he is seen collecting a pair of boots from an eagle.

All or nothing: The slogan for the campaign is: 'During the World Cup, I will give my heart to the cause.'
