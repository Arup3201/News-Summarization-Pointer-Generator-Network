Clive Palmer has apologised to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief-of-staff for personally attacking her over the government's paid parental leave scheme.

The Palmer United Party leader used parliamentary debate on Monday to suggest Peta Credlin would receive a 'massive benefit when she gets pregnant' on the scheme, and suggested she was somehow responsible for it.

Mr Palmer said he was unaware Ms Credlin had unsuccessful attempts to conceive through IVF and wrote a letter of apology on Tuesday morning.

'I did that well before this was a big controversy,' he said.

Apologised: MP and mining magnate Clive Palmer has written a letter of apology to Tony Abbott staffer Peta Credlin following comments he made claiming she was behind the paid parental leave scheme

'I told her it was a matter of great regret if there was any way I offended her personally.'

Mr Palmer however didn't back down entirely and again criticised the policy for favouring successful women, who are capable of looking after themselves, over battling stay-at-home mums.

On Wednesday Prime Minister Tony Abbott hit back at Clive Palmer after the MP attacked Mr Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin and suggested that she has 'undue influence' over the PM.

Mr Abbott addressed Mr Palmer's offensive comment, in which he said the Federal Government had designed the paid parental leave scheme 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant'.

Mr Abbott on Wednesday said: 'Well I think that blokes around this place have learned to underestimate women at their peril. I'll just make that general observation.'

Prime Minister Tony Abbott weighed in on the controversy over Clive Palmer's comments about the PM's chief of staff Peta Credlin on Wednesday

He added: 'The other observation that I'll make is that the gentlemen in question does not understand the Coalition's policy... that all Australian women have access to the paid parental leave scheme.

'Before he goes out and attacks people he really ought to understand the policy.'

It comes after Deputy Leader of the National Party, Barnaby Joyce, on Tuesday made a sexist joke at Ms Credlin's expense while addressing the controversy over Mr Palmer's comments.

On Channel Ten's The Project Mr Joyce claimed that it is rare to see women in a powerful position as these roles are often held by men.

'Peta's got a strong role,' Mr Joyce.

'The Prime Minister is definitely the boss but if you step on Peta's toes she'll put her boot up your backside.'

But when he was asked whether he thought the public found it unusual to see a woman holding such a position of power, he said: 'I'm on good information from her husband that she is a woman.'

Once he realised his error, Mr Joyce quickly apologised and said: 'it was an attempt at humour'.

Mr Joyce also somewhat defended Palmer by claiming earlier in the interview that he too had 'a whole litany of dopey things I've done in my time in politics'.

Palmer, the MP for Fairfax in Queensland, made headlines after he attacked Ms Credlin in parliamentary debate on Monday, saying the Federal Government had designed the paid parental leave scheme 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant'.

Government MPs were quick to condemn Mr Palmer's comment, however Ms Credlin has previously been credited with being the 'power' and the 'brains' behind the prime minister and the person he is 'closest to politically'.

Mr Palmer's comments prompted a rebuke from senior members of the Coalition, with Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop pulling out of a scheduled dinner with the Queensland mining magnate after labelling his comments 'offensive and inappropriate', the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Thr right stuff: The tall, glamorous and highly intelligent Ms Credlin is the most discussed woman in Canberra. Clive Palmer's comments echo previous assessments from within Tony Abbott's own party that she is 'widely believed to have more influence over the way the country is run than most' MPs, who she describes as 'the front men'

Canberra correspondents, a member of Mr Abbott's own party and a senior official told Good Weekend last year Ms Credlin had more influence than many MPs and her role was more like the chief of staff of a US president, 'with cabinet-level status'.

Dubbed 'Ms Fix-it', Credlin was 'the most discussed woman in Canberra, and probably the most powerful'.

Ms Credlin, 43, who has been married to Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, since 2001, has been on an IVF programme.

She told marie claire magazine in January last year the prime minister was deeply supportive of her efforts to have a child through IVF with her husband and said Mr Abbottâ€™s views on abortion, contraception and IVF were far more balanced than many people believe.

Time to question: MP Clive Palmer's criticism of Peta Credlin (pictured with Tony Abbott during question time in the House of Representatives) was that the influence she wields should not supersede that of MPs.  'I think policies should be formulated from the party room,' he said. 'It shouldn't come down from Tony Abbott's office telling elected members of parliament what they will do'

Power behind the throne: Billionaire MP Clive Palmer's claims the government's paid parental leave scheme was designed 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff (Peta Credlin, pictured) can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant' have been widely condemned as insensitive to Ms Credlin who has struggled to conceive on an IVF programme. But the 43-year-old is widely regarded as the 'power' and the 'brains' behind Tony Abbott

The normally private Ms Credlin came under fire then from the Labor Party, which claimed a member of Mr Abbott's personal staff should not use a public forum to overcome Mr Abbott's perceived popularity problem at the time with women voters.

Mr Palmer said he was not aware of Ms Credlin's personal struggles.

The 60-year-old mining magnate denied he was being sexist, telling reporters in Canberra, 'I believe as chief of staff, regardless of whether she is a woman or man, she exercises undue influence on government policy to the detriment of many of the elected members of parliament'.

He said he had made the comments because they concerned government policy.

Calling the shots: Peta Credlin's influence on Prime Minister Tony Abbott is such that journalists say when Mr Abbott made some comments Ms Credlin thought were 'just a little bit out of school' she 'gave him a swift kick in the shin. . . it was done with good humour, but for us, it was a really interesting insight into their relationship.'

'I think policies should be formulated from the party room,' he said. 'It shouldn't come down from Tony Abbott's office telling elected members of parliament what they will do.'

A senior Liberal told Good Weekend last year that Mr Abbott, 'relies on her heavily and respects her judgment' and that 'she is the person in politics he's closest to, no doubt about that.'

Seven network political correspondent Mark Riley gave an account of Mr Abbott and Ms Credlin on the way back from an overseas trip in 2013 when the prime minister made some comments Ms Credlin thought were 'just a little bit out of school'.

'She gave him a swift kick in the shin,' Riley said, 'It was done with good humour. But for us, it was a really interesting insight into their relationship.'

But the government's frontbencher Christopher Pyne has described Mr Palmer's comments as 'cowardly' and 'ignorant', saying the paid parental leave scheme was proposed before Ms Credlin worked for Mr Abbott.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped Mr Palmer reflected on his 'hurtful' comments about Ms Credlin.

'For him to single her out is a particularly hurtful thing for him to do,' she told Sky News.

Nationals MP Darren Chester said he was disgusted with Mr Palmer's comments, and worried about the tone of parliamentary debate when unelected staffers were drawn in and 'personally vilified'.

'It was unnecessary for Mr Palmer to be so personally vindictive in the comments he made,' he told reporters, 'he should apologise.'

Liberal MP Dennis Jensen said staffers were not 'fair game' in parliament.

'The people who to a certain extent are fair game are us as politicians, but once again it shouldn't get down to personal invective,' Dr Jensen said.

'You should deal with issues, not with personalities.'

Nationals MP Andrew Broad, who tweeted his disapproval of the 'gutter politics' after Mr Palmer made the statement, added the comments were hurtful for couples like he and his wife who had also struggled with fertility.

'People expect better of members of parliament,' he said.
