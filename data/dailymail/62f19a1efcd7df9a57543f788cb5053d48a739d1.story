In Guatemala City or Tegucigalpa, Honduras, it might be normal to spot an iguana creeping up the walls of your block of flats.

But this was Vienna, Austria, and the last thing Maria Maier expected to see when she leant out of her window for a cigarette was a bright green reptile crawling up towards her.

It had escaped after her neighbour of several floors down left the window open.

Bizarre: This was the astonishing site that greeted Austrian woman Maria Maier, 38, when she opened the window of her 16th floor flat to have a cigarette - and spotted this scaled lizard stuck to the wall outside

Firefighters clamber out with nets to try to recapture the errant iguana. It's owner had not called authorities after his pet escaped because he hadn't registered it and so was keeping it in his home illegally

'It seemed to be able to walk up the wall like it had glue on its feet,' said Ms Maier, 38. 'It was moving around to make sure he got the best place to catch the sun from what I could see.'

Growing in size to up to five or six feet, including their tail, iguanas are spiny, herbivorous reptiles with a remarkable third-eye thought to be involved in thermoregulation.

They are popular pets, but require demanding care and many die after just a few years. This iguana had made a break for it when its owner's back was turned.

It clambered from the window and disappeared down to the fifth floor before turning around and heading back up the the 16th.

The owner had not called police because the iguana not registered with the authorities, meaning it was being kept illegally.

Ms Maier alerted the authorities after spotting the iguana from her flat window. Firemen were able hang from the windows of flats near where it settled to use large nets to capture it.

It has been handed over to Vienna animal welfare officers who will decide what to do with it.
