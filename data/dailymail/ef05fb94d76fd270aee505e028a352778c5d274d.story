He is the boy from a quaint fishing town in Ireland, but Seamus Coleman could soon find himself as one of the most expensive defenders in British history.

As Louis van Gaal holds talks over the purchase of signings at Manchester United on Friday afternoon, the name of the Everton defender will be raised.

He is one of the most enthralling Premier League players to watch, blending his modern day professionalism with spirit of eras gone by perfectly.

Coleman is someone who would improve almost every team in the top flight, and has his perseverance to thank for that. He is a different kind of footballer, grateful for what he has but still holds ambition to play at the very top. His slick and stylish panache on and off the ball is all that Everton want in a player, but he is very much different off the pitch.

There are aspects of Coleman’s life that are markedly different to the majority of his peers. Firstly, he is exceptionally modest, humble and treats the business for what it is: a job, and one which requires serious devotion.

The Irishman turns up to Finch Farm each day, works hard and then goes home. There are no airs and graces to him; just a man born in a fishing town in County Donegal. He has a long-term girlfriend, leads a settled life and is dedicated to his family.

Those, coupled with his fearless nature at right-back, is what appeals to Roberto Martinez and why he is now one of the first names on the Everton sheet each week.

The Spaniard saw something in Coleman right from the off.

On taking the job at Goodison Park at the beginning of last season, Martinez knew there was something to work with here. Coleman had played the majority of the previous year and impressed by all accounts – his willingness to run up and down the right-hand touchline for 90 minutes an obvious appeal to the new boss.

But, interestingly, Coleman wasn’t doing enough for Martinez. The criticism was that he’d stop when he hit the final third – almost passing on the burden of responsibility to those in front of him.

It could be construed as having been a cop-out, but Martinez felt his man just needed a push, pulling him to one side at half-time of the very first game of 2013-14, telling the defender he needed to start continuing his runs into the penalty area.

So he did, and at breakneck speed. Coleman is a buccaneering full-back not seen enough in the modern game. He is a player to excite the ground, get them up off their seats. That, in essence, is all Everton supporters want.

In 2009, when he joined Everton, Coleman had been playing for Republic of Ireland's U21 side for two years

He was given a chance at first-team action in 2010 when he was loaned to Blackpool in the Championship

And it is what the Blackpool fans of 2010 saw plenty of when Coleman’s career really kicked off during a loan spell on the Fylde Coast which ended in promotion to the Premier League.

In April of that season, during an away win at Scunthorpe United, Coleman picked up the ball 35 yards out. He looked ahead and charged towards the home penalty area, weaving his way through United defenders and using attackers as decoys. The move finished in the youngster flicking in to the net and the whole of Glanford Park rose as one to applaud a goal which ought to have adorned a stage far grander.

He had come from nowhere. Everton signed him for £60,000 from Sligo Rovers a the year previous but there were no opportunities to impress in the first team.

The goal that made everyone turn and look at Coleman came while on loan at Blackpool, against Scunthorpe

Coleman is known for his buccaneering runs from full-back, and is a mainstay in Everton's first team

Blackpool, and winning the Championship play-off final at Wembley, provided a springboard. He’s taken it gleefully.

The only blot is Coleman’s age. Even though he is seen as someone still coming through, he is now 26.

That is largely down to an injury picked up on a pre-season tour of Seattle prior to his loan in the Championship. The blister on his toe became infected – a small procedure becoming far larger and setting him back months.

Now he’s making up for lost time, and it’d be no surprise if Van Gaal opens that sizeable chequebook and pays what the Toffees demand for a man who epitomises the right balance of professionalism and flair.
