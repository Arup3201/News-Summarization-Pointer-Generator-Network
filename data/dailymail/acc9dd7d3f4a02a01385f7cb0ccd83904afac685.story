Ukip is trying to stop a comedy band from touring, despite Nigel Farage saying politicians should ‘let people tell their jokes’. 

Musical duo Jonny and The Baptists have taken their show The Stop Ukip Tour on the road, but venues have been bombarded with complaints from Ukip supporters. 

And the party’s deputy leader Paul Nuttal has condemned the ‘distasteful satire’, calling on the Arts Council to investigate funding given to theatres hosting the act.

The bizarre attempt to interfere with a comedy act appears to be at odds with Ukip’s strident attacks on political correctness and the fear of giving offence. 

Last week Mr Farage defended a stand-up comic who told a string of jokes targeting foreigners at the Ukip spring conference. 

But it has emerged the party has tried to prevent the Jonny And The Baptists shows going ahead.

The group’s song about Ukip suggests the party believes all Eastern Europeans ‘live off benefits and won't let us watch Jim Davidson' and wants 'the Queen's jubilee [to] be every day', the website Chortle reported. 

However writing on the Ukip website, Mr Nuttall said: ‘Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and UKIP is very much the party of free speech but I think it is wrong that taxpayers money is being used to back this production," explained Mr Nuttall.

‘It does, of course, show just how much left wing supporters are getting extremely worried about the growing success of UKIP. We wouldn't be under attack from these musical comedians unless we were proving a threat to the established order. 

‘This blatantly party political rubbish is being staged to coincide with the run-up to the Euro elections in May and I am appalled that one of the venues in the much lauded Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester. I would have hoped they had higher standards than giving this show house room. 

‘I have written to the Arts Council about this matter and also the Royal Exchange expressing my views about this distasteful satire.’ 

However, one of the venues targeted by complaints says it has no record of the people who claim to be loyal customers offended by the booking. 

The Royal Exchange in Manchester said: ‘We've never had as many complaints about a show. 

‘We had calls from people saying they were loyal customers and they come a lot but when we checked their names in our database they've never bought a ticket before. I think it was kind of to give us the scares.' 

Lead singer Jonny Donahoe insisted his group has not received Arts Council money. ‘They might be involved in a small way with some of those venues but that's a very different thing. We're a comedy group. I've never heard of anyone getting a comedy grant.' 

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has previously defended the right of comedians to tell whatever jokes they want

At the Ukip spring conference last week comedian Paul Eastwood sparked controversy with jokes at a gala dinner about Polish people, a Muslim butcher and Somali pirates. 

Defending the act, Mr Farage said: ‘I'm not going to comment on individual jokes, but I think we're in huge danger here. This was a guy telling jokes about national stereotypes, not racial stereotypes. 

‘We are heading down a road here where we would kill all humour in this country if we tear things to pieces. 

‘Enough is enough, let people tell their jokes. If what they say is inappropriate they won't earn a living because they won't get booked again.’
