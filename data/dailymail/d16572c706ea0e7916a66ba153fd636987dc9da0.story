An elderly couple have been found dead in their home in a suspected murder suicide, it emerged today.

Officers said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the two deaths.

The alarm had been raised by a member of the public who was concerned for the welfare of the couple.

Police forced their way into the semi-detached house at 3pm on Friday and found the pair dead.

A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'It was shocking to find out what had happened.

'They seemed like a very pleasant couple but they were quite quiet.

'I did not know them too well.

'It appears he must have stabbed her and then taken his own life - it is such a tragedy.'

Another neighbour said Mr Pearmain had taken the overdose before stabbing his wife and then hanged himself in the couple’s bathroom.

The neighbour said: 'Apparently he had taken an overdose of some sort before he did what he did to her - I think he was under the influence of whatever he had taken.

'I heard he then hanged himself in the bathroom.

'We have no idea why he might have done this but it is very sad.'

A post-mortem examination found that Mrs Pearmain had died from a stab wound to the chest but police are waiting for a toxicology test result for her husband.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Ross from Hertfordshire Police said: 'This is a very tragic case.

'The post mortems have concluded that Mrs Pearmain died of stab wounds and we’re currently awaiting the results of toxicology results for Mr Pearmain.

'I would stress that we do not believe there has been any third party involvement in this case.

'Specialist support is being given to the families at this very difficult time.'
