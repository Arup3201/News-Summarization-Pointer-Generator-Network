This is the sickening squalor left behind at a once-loved family home by tenants from hell.

A couple and their five children lived in this stomach-churning filth - sharing it with up to 14 mastiff dogs.

Occupants Louisa and Joe Roylance were eventually kicked out of the house in Gosberton Risegate, Lincolnshire, owing £7,000 in unpaid rent after legal action by owners Midge Clayton and partner Richard Douville.

Squalor: The home of Midge and Dick Clayton after it was vacated by their tenants, leaving £8,000 in damage

Horror: The Claytons in front of the family home they built. The tenants left with arrears of £7,000

Staggering: Five children and 14 large dogs lived in these bleak conditions

Unhygienic: The kitchen was filled with discarded food containers and the house had no hot water

The house stank of dog faeces and urine and rotting food, detectable from outside

They found five years' worth of mess and £8,000 in damage inside their house.

The air was filled with the sickening stench of dog faeces, urine and rotting food and hundreds of flies were swarming in the kitchen.

Two of the four bedrooms had been turned into kennels and dog mess was caked on the walls and floor.

Vile: The fridge was smeared in dirt and rotting food

Other rooms were torn apart and black bags filled with rubbish and dirty clothes were left piled in heaps four feet high.

Outside, the rear garden was filled with waste from the big Dogue de Bordeaux mastiffs and the front had been turned into a tip

Miss Clayton, a mother-of-three who is recovering from breast cancer, said: 'I've cried buckets.

'When we built this home it was lovely.

'Our children are heartbroken - we had such good times here. We thought we were letting it to another family with children who would love it, too.

'But they have destroyed it. I can't believe people live like this.'

Miss Clayton, 61,  a palliative care nurse, and Mr Douville built the house in 2001 as their family home.

They tried to sell it five years ago when Midge underwent a knee replacement and needed to move into a bungalow.

The couple priced it at £270,000 but it failed to sell and they decided to rent it out instead.

They imposed a limit of four dogs on the tenancy agreement as the utility room had already been fitted out for their own dogs.

Joe Roylance, 55, and his 35-year-old wife moved into the property in 2008 with their four daughters aged between eight and their mid-teens and a teenaged son.

But in January this year Miss Clayton and Mr Douville discovered they had 14 dogs living there and started trying to get them out.

The Roylances refused to pay their rent and whenever Midge and Richard called they refused to see them or made themselves scarce.

Nauseating: One of the 14 mastiff's food bowls, left filled with mouldy food

Kennel: Even the cupboard under the stairs appears to have been converted into living space for the dogs

Trashed: The extensive damage will cost £8,000 to fix. Even the insides of cupboards and drawers were caked with filth

Grime: Filthy clothes were strewn all over the house

The couple started a six-month legal battle that cost them £2,000 which resulted in a possession order in April. They got the nightmare family out a month later.

Miss Clayton said: 'We've had people come and look at the house, step inside and come back out again and throw up on the lawn because of the smell.

'The irony is we are dog people and we know how difficult it is to rent a property with pets.

'We told them they could have four dogs as there were kennels in the back.

'We advertised the house in a dog magazine and we were completely taken advantage of. They destroyed our home.

'We never dreamed it was their intention to breed dogs - at one point there were 14 here.'

Bin bags were filled to the brim and then simply left on the carpet

Smeared: The front door and exterior walls were covered in mud, probably from the dogs

Discarded: A torn and stained mattress in a bedroom

A dismantled bed and what appears to be sawdust in one of the rooms

Mr Douville, 60, a taxi driver, questioned how the house was able to get into such a state as social services visited the property during the Roylances' stay.

He said: 'What we can't understand is how the children lived in this house. I was disturbed to see the dogs lived there, let alone their kids.

'In all those months we were in contact with social services trying to get them out of the house they must have been living in pure squalor.

'We could never see inside because they had the curtains closed so when we finally gained access I was horrified. The smell, the dirt - it clings to your skin.

Mess: The garden covered in dog faces and plastic sheeting. It is believed the dogs were being bred there

The front of the house was also strewn with waste, including a tyre and cardboard boxes full of rubbish

'In the bathroom the clothes were piled up four foot high and in the utility room it was 18 inches deep in rubbish and dirt. I have literally been shoveling it out of the house.

'The kitchen is destroyed and chewed by dogs and the carpets are ruined.

'The boiler hasn't been serviced or used since 2010 so they were living without hot water and heating for all that time - no wonder it is in such a state.'

He added: 'I can't believe social services went in and thought the place fit to live in.

'They paid rent up until January so we never thought it was a problem. When we saw Louisa out and about she would look presentable.

'Unbelievably social services said I was intimidating the children by going around and asking for rent money.

'I don't know how they said that with a straight face - what is intimidating is the Third-World squalor they have been living among.'

Richard and Midge, who have seven grandchildren, now fear they might be forced to sell their own bungalow to repair the damage.
