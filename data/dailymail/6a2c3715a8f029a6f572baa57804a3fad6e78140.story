A group of Britons waging jihad in Syria have threatened to carry out terror attacks in the UK.

The extremists warned of atrocities on London’s public transport, at financial centres and also at the White House in the US.

They are believed to be the first direct threats of terrorist strikes in the West to emerge from Syria, where hundreds of Britons are among thousands of foreign fighters who have joined jihadist rebel groups.

'Sometimes you just got to get up and go': In a series of threats issued online by the Rayat Al-Tawheed group, one image shows a man inside a vehicle with an assault rifle as a red London Routemaster bus passes by

'You only die once why not make it martyrdom': This image on the group's website shows a laptop computer with the barrel of an assault rifle resting on the keyboard and ammunition lined up under the screen

They emerged as the head of US intelligence James Clapper told the US Congress that Al Qaeda has set up training camps in Syria and was schooling foreign recruits to return to their home countries to carry out terrorist attacks.

British counter-terrorism officials are taking the threats of terror attacks in the UK ‘very seriously’, sources said.

In a series of threats issued online by the Rayat Al-Tawheed group, the British jihadist faction in Syria, one image shows a man inside a vehicle with an assault rifle as a red London Routemaster bus passes by.

A slogan on the image in English says: ‘Sometimes you just got to get up and go.’

Another appears to make a reference to MI6. It shows a laptop computer with the barrel of an assault rifle resting on the keyboard and ammunition lined up under the screen, which displays an image of a hand gun and the phrase: ‘You only die once why not make it martyrdom.’

Yet another shows a man with a rifle wearing an Arabic-style scarf standing in front of the White House.

A
 caption reads: ‘Wait a while there will come to you mounts carrying 
lions in shining armour battalions followed by battalions.’

Last month it emerged brothers Akram and Mohamed Sebah, from Holloway, North London, were killed waging jihad in Syria.

The Rayat Al-Tawheed group is  believed to be headed by two Islamists from London.

It operates a number of social 
networking accounts and two suspected leaders could be heard speaking 
with distinct London accents in a video issued online.

An
 image posted on one such account showed numerous wads of £10, £20 and 
£50 notes laid out on a table, with the suggestion they were donations 
from supporters in the UK.

A caption says: ‘And we still stacking for the Big Boyz!’

Other
 images show suspected  British fighters holding automatic assault 
rifles and manning anti- aircraft cannons mounted on the back of pick-up
 trucks.

One Rayat 
Al-Tawheed account was operated by an individual  called Umar Siddiq and
 another apparent member called himself Mujahid Sayyad.

He claimed in his biographical information he was from London and was ‘a commando with the brothers’.

One of the group’s videos included an appeal for British well-wishers  to send cash and warned that fighting in Syria was not for the faint-hearted.

Another video issued by the group included a recording of several British fighters talking about becoming suicide bombers in Syria.

Earlier this week it was reported that another Briton waging jihad in Syria, a prolific Twitter user known online as Abu Layth al-Khorasani [the Afghan], had been killed in the north of the country.

He appeared to have enjoyed leadership status among Britons fighting in Syria.
