Boxing's knockout king Gennady Golovkin has claimed he now wants to beat his next opponent by going all 12 rounds, rather than inflict the 30th stoppage of his burgeoning career.

The Kazakh warrior is on the brink of becoming boxing's next superstar after causing a trail of destruction. In his 32-fight career, Golovkin has 29 knockouts, meaning his 90.6 per cent KO rate is the highest in the history of the middleweight division.

Golovkin's next opponent will be Willie Monroe Jnr on May 16 in Inglewood, California - just three months after his latest brutal KO, of Britain's Martin Murray in Monaco. And the IBO/WBA and WBC interim middleweight champion said he hoped to be taken the distance for the first time in 20 fights and seven years.

Golovkin gives the thumbs up, and the WBC have done the same for his hopes of fighting Miguel Cotto

'(Monroe) is great opponent for me. I need a decision fight,' Golovkin told Seconds Out. 'I need to win by decision in a big fight.'

Asked if that means he hopes Monroe will last the full distance, Golovkin said: 'I hope so - my goal is to beat any style. He has good style.'

He added: '(Monroe) is southpaw, he is a very smart guy. Every champion has trouble with a southpaw.'

Golovkin has amassed an incredible 29 knockouts in 32 middleweight fights

The other leading middleweights have been reluctant face up to Golovkin's awesome power - the 32-year-old is now widely regarded as the biggest pound-for-pound puncher in the business.

But Golovkin has his sights firmly set on Miguel Cotto, unless Monroe (19-1, 6 KOs) is able to pull off a huge upset.

'Miguel is WBC champion, I have the interim belt. (A fight would be) very good for us,' he said. 'He is a great name, Miguel is a big name. I respect him, he is a great champion.'

And the WBC last month ordered Cotto to take their world middleweight title into a unification battle with Golovkin. He was told to do so within three months of a voluntary title defence this spring, against an as-yet-unnamed opponent.

'We have instructed Miguel that he must fight Gennady, as his mandatory challenger, next after his April fight, assuming of course that he wins,’ said WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman.
