It's a murder trial involving almost a
half-dozen mistresses, a botched investigation at a troubled police 
department and a missing pickup truck at the heart of the case.

After a month of testimony, the trial
of former Albuquerque police officer Levi Chavez , accused of killing his wife with
his service weapon, has become a tale of workplace romances and steamy 
affairs, including a love triangle at the hair salon where the victim 
worked.

In all, four mistresses and a woman 
who married defendant just after his wife's death have 
testified about their trysts with him. Several of the women were police 
officers.

The case also has threatened to 
further tarnish the reputation of the beleaguered Albuquerque Police 
Department, which already is under investigation by the U.S. Justice 
Department over a series of police shootings.

Accused: Prosecutors have depicted Levi Chavez as a philanderer whose marriage was crumbling, and say he killed his wife after she found out he had staged the theft of his pickup truck to collect the insurance proceeds

The trial included allegations that officers at the scene removed and even flushed key evidence down the toilet.

Chavez, 32, is accused of shooting 
his 26-year-old wife, Tera Chavez, with his department-issued gun in 
2007 at their Los Lunas home and then trying to make her death look like
a suicide.

Prosecutors have depicted Chavez as a
philanderer whose marriage was crumbling, and say he killed his wife 
after she found out that he had staged the theft of his pickup truck 
valued at more than $20,000 to collect the insurance proceeds.

The defense says the death was a 
suicide by a woman unraveling over her failed marriage and 
relationships. Chavez's lawyer says he could not have killed his wife in
October 2007 because he was with another woman at the time.

Tera Chavez was also having an affair
with an Albuquerque police officer who was married to the maid of honor
in her wedding, witnesses said. They had sex in the back of a hair 
salon where she worked, according to testimony.

'This trial is like a mosquito in a 
nudist colony,' said Tom Garrity, owner of the Albuquerque-based public 
relations firm The Garrity Group. 'Where do you begin?'

The case is nearing the end as defense attorney David Serna calls final witnesses this week.

Serna, who has long represented 
clients in high-profile New Mexico homicide cases, was able to convince 
the judge to bar statements Tera Chavez made about her husband and his 
'cop buddies' staging the theft of Levi Chavez's 2004 Ford F-250 truck 
as part of an insurance scam.

Now Serna is working to show how his client was a victim of a larger effort to paint him as a monster.

'There has been a persistent anti-Levi Chavez campaign by the media from the beginning,' Serna told The Associated Press.

A key to Serna's defense strategy has
been to discredit former Valencia County Sheriff's Detective Aaron 
Jones, one of the first investigators on the scene who concluded that 
the death 'looked staged.'

Serna has portrayed Jones as a 
conspiracy theorist unable to hold steady law enforcement jobs in 
California and New Mexico as he kept stumbling upon 'nefarious 
activities' involving crooked police that were never borne out.

Jones was taken off the investigation into Tera Chavez's death after calling his supervisors derogatory names.

He was also in the middle of one of 
the trial's more colorful moments when he testified that he believed 
Chavez was pretending to cry over his wife's death during interviews, 
which he saw as a clue Chavez might have been involved.

'If there is no snot, believe him 
not,' he testified in a comment that drew immediate comparisons to 
attorney Johnnie Cochran's theatrics during the O.J. Simpson trial.

But Chavez and his lawyer suffered an
apparent setback last week when a crime scene expert testifying in his 
defense failed to pull off a demonstration of how the officer's wife 
might have been able to kill herself with his gun.

There was a bullet in the gun's 
chamber when it was found next to Tera Chavez's body, leading 
prosecutors to argue that she could not have shot herself and then 
released the magazine.

Larry McCann, the expert, suggested 
that Tera Chavez held the gun upside down and used her thumb to pull the
trigger. But McCann tried a few times to show jurors that he could pull
the trigger and press the gun's magazine release in one continuous 
motion, but it didn't work.

'I can't get it to work today,' he said.

The failed demonstration drew gasps, smiles and whispers from members of Tera Chavez's family.

The investigation also has been 
criticized since an Albuquerque officer, on scene to help Levi Chavez 
cope with his wife's death, cut out a piece of a bloody mattress and had
the piece destroyed.

Another officer used a toilet and 
flushed it before investigators had a chance to examine what may have 
been blood floating inside.

In other testimony, a digital 
forensic investigator with the Los Lunas Police Department told the jury
that an Internet search from November 2006 on 'how to kill someone' was
found on Levi Chavez's computer.

The testimony from Levi Chavez's 
former mistresses included other bizarre details. One mistress provided 
an alibi, and another, who was called to counter the alibi, said that 
while she was carrying on the affair, she got her hair done by Tera 
Chavez at a Los Lunas salon.

Another mistress said she and Levi 
Chavez had sex in a house he once shared with his wife just a few weeks 
after the wife was found dead.

'I think people are more focused on 
all the drama that the positions of both sides arguing their cases,' 
Garrity said. 'Jurors will have a hard time not to be caught up in that 
drama.'
