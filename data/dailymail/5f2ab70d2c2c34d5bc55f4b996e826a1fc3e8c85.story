An 85-year-old grandmother died after accidentally being given tablets that were three times stronger than her regular medication, an inquest has heard.

Betty Gough, from Longlevens, Gloucestershire, had been taking the stronger pills for a month before she  had a fall at home, fracturing eight ribs and puncturing her lung.

An inquest at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court heard that the overdose of anti-depressant pill Dosulepin could have caused her to lose her balance, and become unsteady or disoriented. 

Betty Gough, 85, was given a box of pills that were three times stronger than her regular does - and had been taking them for a month before she fell over suffering eight fractured ribs and a punctured lung

Lloyds Pharmacy in Longlevens admitted giving her a box of 75mg pills, but with a label printed on the front saying 25mg - her usual dosage.

Mrs Gough had been taking the same medication since 1984 with no problems and had no history of falls before her accident.

Patients are being urged to go pharmacies for treatment to cut visits to overburdened GP surgeries.

NHS England is today launching a campaign to urge patients with minor ailments to make better use of the 11,500 high street chemists across England.

A survey by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said treating patients in pharmacies could cut A&E visits by 650,000 a year, and reduce GP consultations by 18million.

Sheila Reade, Mrs Gough's daughter, said: 'I noticed that my mum was not at all herself - she became confused and forgetful  - and I thought she was beginning to suffer from dementia.'

After Ms Gough's death Lloyds Pharmacy sent the family a letter admitting to the blunder, saying the shop had been 'busy' that day.

The company apologised for the error, adding that the pills had been handed out by a trainee, with the box checked by a supervisor.

Mrs Gough's son, Sydney, told the inquest that his mother called him at 3am on April 28 to say she had fallen, hitting her side on a cabinet.

He said he went to her house and put her into bed, before calling for an ambulance. She was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where she received a CT scan and an X-Ray.

Doctors confirmed she had suffered eight fractured ribs, a punctured lung, and internal bleeding. Despite attempts to save her, she died on May 6.

Assistant Coroner David Dooley Dooley said: 'The medication was dispensed in error and possibly contributed to her instability.'

Lloyds Pharmacy in Longlevens, Gloucestershire, sent the family a letter apologising for the blunder - saying the shop had been 'busy' on the day she collected the pills

Giving a narrative verdict, Mr Dooley said: 'Mrs Betty Gough was an 85-year-old lady with no history of falls.

'On April 28, 2014 she fell against a cabinet at her house resulting in her sustaining multiple rib fractures and subsequent internal bleeding from which she deteriorated and died at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital on May 6, 2014.

'Erroneous dispensing of her regular antidepressant prescription for Dolsulepin at thee times the appropriate level was considered a possible contributory factor in recent problems with balance which first became apparent as being suffered by Mrs Gough in mid-March, 2014.'

After the inquest Sydney Gough added: 'We are of course taking this matter further and are considering legal action against Lloyds Pharmacy but decided to wait for the inquest first.'
