The distraught mother of an 8-year-old boy who saved five people from a burning trailer before dying in the flames has said her son's heroic actions made her 'really proud,' but she just wants him back.

A tearful Crystal Vrooman opened up about the tragic Monday morning inferno, explaining that Tyler Doohan died trying to save his grandfather, who was his 'best friend.'

The pair were found together on a bed in the back room of the charred Penfield, New york mobile home. Authorities said it appeared the child was trying to lift the elderly man off the bed when he was overcome by smoke and flames.

Best friend: A tearful Crystal Vrooman, pictured, said her son, Tyler Doonhan, died trying to save his grandfather, who was his 'best friend'

'All I could think about is how he couldn't breathe, how scared he must have been, Vrooman told WHAM.

She added: 'I'm just so grateful that he went with people that he loved. He didn't go alone.'

The boy, from East Rochester, was staying with relatives in the nearby town of Penfield overnight on Sunday. Vrooman recalled hugging her son goodbye before the sleepover, and he had a big smile on his face.

But after 4 a.m. Monday, Tyler noticed a fire had broken out in the narrow trailer when his 4-year-old cousin's blanket set alight. 

Vrooman told the station that, after waking five of his relatives and ensuring they got out safely, Tyler broke away from his aunt and ran back inside the burning trailer.

'He just ran to the back steps and my sister followed him and tried to stop him,' said Vrooman.

The boy's grandfather, Stephen Smith, was disabled and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own, Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer said.

'By that time, the fire had traveled to the back of the trailer,' said Ebmeyer. 'Unfortunately they both succumbed to heat and smoke.'

Vrooman said her sister initially had Tyler's hand when he stepped into the trailer.

'I guess he let go of her and tried to get to my dad. She opened the window and he wasn't there anymore. She started feeling around through the smoke,' she said, crying.

'It was his best friend, and he just tried to save him.'

Ebmeyer said the trailer had no working smoke detector.

Deadly inferno: An electrical fire engulfed Louis Beach's single-wide mobile home in the town of Penfield as nine people slept inside Sunday night

He said that with so many people in one small mobile home, one alarm could have easily woken everyone in time to survive.

There was at least one space heater inside the trailer, he said.

Another relative was killed in the fire along with several pets - including dogs, cats, a rabbit and hamsters, Ebmeyer said.

An
 online fundraising campaign on YouCaring.com had raised more than 
$46,900 as of Wednesday night for Tyler's funeral and his family.

Earlier Wednesday, Cpl. John
 Helfer of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said nine people were in 
the single-wide mobile home when the electrical fire started around 4.45
 a.m. Monday.

Fatalities: The raging blaze killed Doohan, his grandfather and amputee uncle, who were unable to flee in time

Horrific find: Tyler's body was found in the rare of the scorched home, just feet away from the bedridden family member he was trying to rescue

The Democrat and Chronicle reported
 that Tyler asked his mother if he could stay with his grandfather at 39
 Fondiller Avenue because he knew he was off from school Monday for 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

The boy's uncle, Joseph Breyette, said his young nephew heard Smith calling for help inside the house and rushed in to get him. 

'The
 kid has got more guts than I know of,' Breyette said. 'I mean to run 
back in there and go through what he went through to try to save him, 
what can you say for the kid? He was a great kid.'

The
 child's body was discovered by firefighters in the rear bedroom just a 
few feet away from the bed of his disabled grandfather, who also 
perished.

The boy's relatives who managed to flee from the trailer were taken to Strong Memorial Hospital.

Ebmeyer said if it weren't for Tyler's actions, the number of fatalities could have been much higher.

'He saved those other people,' he said.

Safe haven: Neighbors say Louis Beach was in the habit of letting relatives who didn't have a place to live stay in his home

Makeshift memorial: Tyler's friends and members of the community have been leaving teddy bears, flowers and other tokens in honor of the brave fourth-grader

Neighbors at the trailer park said the
 reason the mobile home was overcrowded with people Sunday night was 
because he often welcomed down-on-their-luck relatives who needed a 
place to stay.

Those 
who knew the family described Tyler as a rambunctious boy who liked 
playing kickball and tag with other children in the area.

According to his education records, the child had been in and out of several different schools over the past few years.

He was currently enrolled as a fourth-grader in the East Rochester Central School District, where officials called the boy a hero this week.

'He was the kind of young man who would bend over backwards for anybody. He was a very caring individual always came to school with a smile on his face. Always asking what can I do to help,' Interim Superintendent Richard Stuntzman Jr told the station WHEC.

Stuntzman added: 'In bravely and selflessly giving his own life, he was able to save the lives of six others - and he truly is a hero.'
