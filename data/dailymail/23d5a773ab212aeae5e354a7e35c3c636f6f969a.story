Wayne Rooney has two weeks to convince Louis van Gaal he can be the next captain of Manchester United.

It is understood Rooney remains the front-runner to start the season as skipper because main captaincy rival Robin van Persie will not be match fit for the opening Barclay’s Premier League game against Swansea a week on Saturday.

Van Persie, who captained Van Gaal’s Holland team during the World Cup finals in Brazil this summer, returns to training today after a post-tournament break.

Van Gaal has doubts about handing the club captaincy to Van Persie, 30, given that he is prone to injury and may not always play.

The same misgivings apply to other prime candidates - Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher and Jonny Evans.
