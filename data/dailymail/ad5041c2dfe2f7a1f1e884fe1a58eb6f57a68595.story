A Russian man has come up with an ingenious way to beat the thieves - winching his beloved motorbike up to his third floor window to lock it away safely at night.

After having two motorbikes stolen in quick succession it seemed Boris Farihov, 56, from Nizhny Novgorod  in Western Russia would have to give up on two-wheeled transport altogether.

But when his wife joked that the only way to keep a bike safe would be to keep it indoors it gave him  a flash of inspiration.

Going up: Russian man Boris Farihov has found a novel way to beat the thieves - winching his motorcycle up to his third floor window every night

So Mr Farihov purchased
 an electric motor and connected it up to a steel cable which he fixed 
on the wall, and now every time he needs the bike he simply presses a 
button and lowers it down to the ground below.

He said: 'I had my first bike locked up with three padlocks but it was still stolen.

'The
 second bike I bought I had only had a day, and was planning to buy 
extra strong padlocks for it, but it disappeared that night as well.

Mr Farihov's first bike was stolen from outside his apartment block despite  being locked up with three padlocks. He had the second for just one day before that too was stolen

'After that I decided I needed to come up with something else and my wife jokingly said the only safe place to keep it would be indoors – and I thought why not?'

Then in the evening he winches the vehicle backup to the third floor balcony in his flat in the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod and sleeps well at night knowing that it is safe and will not be stolen.

He said: 'It is not much more work than putting three padlocks on the bike, and it's a lot more secure.'

Police in Nizhny Novgorod said that motorbike theft was a growing problem with professional gangs targeting even low value machines which were usually quickly resold for their spare parts after being broken up.
