Brazilian police investigating the on-stage shooting of a rapper say he may have been the victim of a vigilante death squad with links to the police that could also be responsible for the murders of six other MCs.

Daniel Pellegrine, a 20-year-old funk singer known as MC Daleste, was shot in the stomach in front of more than 4,000 fans while performing at a free concert in Campinas, São Paulo on Saturday night. 

Video footage of the incident posted on the internet shows the rapper slumping to the ground mid-way through a rant about the police.

Killed on stage: Daniel Pellegrine, a 20-year-old funk singer known as MC Daleste, was shot in the stomach in front of a crowd of more than 4,000 fans

Moments from death:  He was performing at a free concert in Campinas, São Paulo on Saturday night in which many of his songs contain anti-police lyrics. Right, the moment he is struck by the second bullet

This is the seventh death of an MC 
since 2010. It could have been eight but rapper Julio Cesar Ferreira, 
26, also known as MC Neguinho Caxeta, miraculously survived when gunmen sprayed his car
 with bullets in June 2012. Four lodged in his back, narrowly missing his 
vital organs.

Detectives investigating the murder of Daleste, who before his death was raking in £60,000 a
 month as a rapper, are refusing to rule out the possibility that he was
 deliberately executed by a hitman connected to the police.

The
 vigilante gangs are widely referred to in Brazil as ‘grupos de 
extermínio’ or ‘Milicia’ and operate in and around São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Fatal shot: Video footage of the incident posted on the internet shows the rapper slumping to the ground after two shots taken from 20 to 30 metres away hit him in the armpit and abdomen, pointing to it being a professional execution

'They are a group 
of assassins that are made up of ex-policemen and serving officers,' 
said Marcelo Rezende, an investigative journalist and presenter of 
Record TV’s prime-time crime show.

'They are mainly military police officers who have either been expelled from the force or have left to go into crime because it offers a more lucrative return than their salaries.

'They are supported by some insiders who continue to serve in the force. These bad guys use their experience combined with their police powers to carry out their criminal activities.'

In April last year three military police officers were arrested but later released over the murder of a rapper known as MC Primo, a 27-year-old father of two who was shot dead on his doorstep in front of his family. At the time the military police launched an internal investigation which is said to be still ongoing.

A year earlier in April 2011, MC Duda Marapé, 27 - real name Eduardo Antônio Lara - was also gunned down. Forensic evidence taken from the scene revealed that the bullets used in his murder came from a .40mm pistol - standard issue for Brazil’s military police.

Did the police do it? On Tuesday this week, a video adding more ammunition to the claim of police vengeance killings emerged online. It was posted by a youth claiming to be a friend of the dead rapper. In it he accuses the police of assassinating Daleste

According to Pegolo Rui, the homicide detective leading the investigation into Daleste’s case, the killer knew what he was doing.

Two shots taken from 20 to 30 metres away from the stage, point to it being a professional execution.

The first bullet skimmed underneath Daleste’s armpit, the second was a direct hit. 'We're not dealing with someone who was shooting for the first time,' said Rui. 'The killer was calm and accurate.'

On Tuesday this week, a video was posted online by a youth claiming to be a friend of the dead rapper accusing the police of assassinating Daleste.

Talking directly to the camera, the unnamed friend claims that Daleste was stopped by uniformed officers on the day of the show.

'The police asked him where did you get your expensive car from, money, clothes and other things. (Daleste) said from hard work but the police didn’t believe him,' says the friend.

'Then they asked him for money. He said he didn’t have any and he wasn’t going to give them any. 

'The police said, "Okay." And they let them go,' he adds.  The friend then claims the same officers returned that night to seek revenge.

Daleste’s father Roland Pellegrine said his son was a good boy who never had any enemies but was killed because of jealousy.

Police have since retrieved the first bullet from the scene of Daleste’s murder. It allegedly matches the .40mm ammunition issued by the military police.
