For many people a hearty fried breakfast including a couple of rashers of bacon is a desirable way to start the day.

But as cooked breakfast or a bacon sandwich isn’t the healthiest option, a new iPhone app and device that wafts the appealing smell of the cured meat could prove to be a more sensible option.

The alarm clock app wakes a person up with the sound of sizzling bacon, while a connected scent device emits a bacon perfume.

The ‘wake up and smell the bacon’ app has been developed by Oscar Mayer – a manufacturer of bacon and other meats in the U.S.

While the iPhone app is readily available and free to download, the accompanying device is not for sale, but a limited number are available to win.

To set the bacon alarm, a user rotates a frying pan and will be awoken at their chosen time by the sound of sizzling and a picture of the meat cooking.

The device which generates the bacon aroma plugs into the iPhone’s headphone jack and releases a spritz of the meaty perfume to coincide with the sizzling alarm, according to Mashable.

‘With nearly two million mentions of #bacon on Instagram, it seems people never get tired of bacon. That’s why our team decided to develop a device to give folks what they long for most,’ said Tom Bick, senior director of integrated marketing and advertising at Oscar Mayer.

The Oscar Mayer device is not the only iPhone plug-in to waft foodie smells.

The Scentee app and device comprises mini air-freshener-like cartridges that clip into a phone.

A user can select to emit a puff of scent at will using the small plastic device.

Individuals can also use the Scentee app to create scent notifications for alerts like emails, Facebook messages and text messages.

Once the device is fitted to the phone, users can select a scented cartridge from floral scents like lavender and jasmine, to food ranging from strawberries and coffee to curry and bacon.

The firm claims it was designed to ‘give bacon aficionados a new reason to welcome their morning alarm clocks’.

People have until April 4 to take a quiz on Oscar Mayer’s website to be in with a chance of winning one of an unspecified number of devices, but entrants must be a U.S. resident.

The device reportedly comes with a refill of bacon perfume.

Oscar Mayer’s device is not the only one to be able to generate foodie smells using an iPhone device and app.

An app called Scentee claims to be able to change the taste of food with its mini air-freshener-like cartridges that clip into a phone.

The idea is that as scent influences 
humans' perception of taste, by smelling a different aroma such as steak
 or curry while eating bland food, the body can be tricked into 
believing it is eating a much tastier dinner.

A
 user can select to emit a puff of scent at will using the small plastic
 device, which also sprays a tiny amount of scent into the air if they 
have set up an alarm, its Japanese inventors said.

The app is made by a popular brand of Bacon owned by Kraft Foods in the U.S. People have until April 4 to take a quiz on Oscar Mayer's website to be in with a chance of winning one of an unspecified number of devices. A graphic promoting the bizarre app is pictured

A playful video by the company suggests that students could use the small device to pretend they are eating luxurious dinners when they are actually re-fuelling by eating a bowl of bland rice.

It also shows a girl on a diet who uses the device to sniff some sizzling meat while munching on substantially less calorific and exciting lettuce leaves.

Individuals can also use the Scentee app to create scent notifications for alerts like emails, Facebook messages and text messages and dinky device for iPhones and Android handsets is available online for 3,480 Yen (approximately £22).

The Scentee device (pictured) plugs into a smartphone's headphones port an costs around £22. The company said users can 'enjoy new feelings of 4D communication' with the device that is rechargeable. Here, the device is shown to be emitting the smell of sizzling meat
