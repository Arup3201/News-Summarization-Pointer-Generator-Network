A billboard mourning Nelson Mandela's death mistakenly displayed a photo of actor Morgan Freeman.

The memorial to Mandela was placed in the city of Coimbatore by the side of a road.

Morgan Freeman played Mandela in 2009 film Invictus which is probably how the mistake arose.

The face of Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman was used on a giant billboard instead of Nelson Mandela's in the tribute gaffe

'We should be proud that we were part of an era when they lived,' read the condolence message on the board in Tamil.

Cloth merchant Chandrashekhar, who paid for the board in a private capacity as a mark of respect to the former South African leader, said it was a mistake by the designer.

"We will replace it with the correct picture of Mandela," the merchant, who uses one name, told AFP by telephone from Chennai, adding that he did not know how the gaffe occurred.

Paying tribute: Morgan also posted a touching tribute message on his Facebook page

Earlier this month Morgan Freeman, paid tribute to Mandela, describing him as 'a saint to many, a hero to all who treasure liberty, freedom and the dignity of humankind'.

The 76-year-old actor – who some mistakenly posted a picture of next to tweets paying tribute to Mandela - added: "As we remember his triumphs, let us, in his memory, not just reflect on how far we've come, but on how far we have to go.

"Madiba may no longer be with us, but his journey continues on with me and with all of us."

Proceedings following the death of Mandela has brought around several gaffes. 

Thamsanqa Jantjie, 34, a South African sign language interpreter accused of making up his own signs

The most high profile has been the man who performed fake sign language during a memorial service.

Thamsanqa Jantjie, 34, stood just a few feet from from President Obama and other leaders who spoke during the ceremony that was broadcast around the world.

His actions were questioned when it was claimed he was signing words like 'prawns' and 'rocking horse'.

Jantjie's explanation was that he had suffered a schizophrenic episode in which he had 'seen angels and heard voices'.

He has now been admitted to a psychiatric hospital after his wife Siziwe revealed her husband was supposed to attend a mental health check-up but postponed the appointment so he could be at the ceremony.
