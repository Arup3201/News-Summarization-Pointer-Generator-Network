The cyber war  between America and North Korea took another turn on Saturday when North Korea's Internet and 3G
mobile networks were paralyzed again for the third time in a week.

The internet outage took hold on Saturday evening at 10.42 pm, for five hours and the North Korean government was quick to blame the United States for the cyber attack.  

The outage comes amid a diplomatic storm which has seen the North Korean government call President Obama 'a monkey living in a tropical forest' in a racist rant against the United States.

Tit-for-tat: The film called The Interview shows Kim Jong Un  dying  after his helicopter is shot down

Jibe: Kim Jong Un, pictured surrounded by military commanders, was quick to blame the United States for the cyber attack

Officials on the National Defense Commission, led by Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, branded  America's  leader 'reckless' and the country he leads 'shameless.'

But Washington has denied it had anything to do with the latest internet breach against the rogue state.

And the U.S is still reeling after the Sony hacking leak which led to the cancellation of the film The Interview, which showed scenes of a mock death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

The attack alleged to be by North Korea was aimed to deter Sony from showing the comedy film.

The plot of which featured a scheme to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and it resulted in major expense and embarrassment for Sony.

President Barack Obama waded into the debate during his last press conference of the year, saying that Sony Pictures Entertainment had made a crucial mistake in censoring  the Christmas Day release of 'The Interview.'

'Sony's a corporation. It has suffered significant damage,' Obama said. 'There were threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced. Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake.'

NORTH KOREAN INTERNET OUTAGE 

North Korea's Internet and 3Gmobile networks were paralyzed again on Saturday for the third time in a week

Hacked: The hackers, called the Guardians of Peace, were upset about the James Franco-Seth Rogen comedy The Interview in which the pair are sent to North Korea to kill Kim Jong Un

New decision: Sony decided to show the film in select cinemas during Christmas in the U.S. despite  threats of a terrorist incident

It was these remarks that fanned the flames of conflict between the two countries.

But it also led Sony bosses to open the film on Christmas day in cinemas and online, making more than $1 million in its first day.

President Barack Obama promised retaliation but did not specify what that would be.

New theory: Linguists at Seattle-based cyber security firm Taia Global studied 1,600 words in the 'Guardians of the Peace' emails and postings, and believe the native language of the hackers is Russian

North Korea continues to deny any involvement in the Sony hacking scandal, instead, accusing the United States of temporarily shutting off its internet this week.

Most of North Korea's heavily restricted internet traffic
passes through Chinese routers on its way to the outside world.

Some technoolgy experts have suggested that it is China - increasingly annoyed by
North Korean behavior  - that is behind North Korea's internet
troubles.

Today, another theory surfaced that Russia was to blame and not North Korea.

Security experts from Seattle-based cyber security firm Taia Global suggested that the origins of the now-infamous 'Guardians of the Peace' are Russian.

They analyzed 1,600 words attached to the Sony emails the hacking group leaked to the media.
