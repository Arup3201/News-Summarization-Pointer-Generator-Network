Roy Hodgson had in his hand a piece of paper. Well, more of a crumpled scrap, to be honest, and it was more a reminder of his ambition and his faith in the future than a declaration of war.

When Hodgson unfolded his training notes, they included names scribbled in biro for a session at St George's Park and the two circled were Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane.

Captain Rooney, with 101 caps and 46 goals, had started the day with a formal presentation of the England player of the year award for 2014, as voted for by supporters.

 Is this going to be England's new strike partnership for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday?

Kane was the new-boy, uncapped, in his first squad, but with eyes and lenses focused on him in search of clues about whether his Tottenham goal rate could be transplanted to the international stage.

The 21-year-old Spurs striker took his tally for the season to 29 with a hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday and inched a little closer to his England debut when Daniel Sturridge pulled out with an injury.

Hodgson proved with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling that he can be bold when it comes to selecting young players and his key decisions will revolve around whether to start with Kane against Lithuania in a sell-out Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley, on Friday.

'His confidence must be sky-high,' said England's vice-captain Gary Cahill. 'To meet up with England for the first time off the back of a hat-trick, he is in a good place and deserves his place in this squad.

'For me he's ready to play, I'm sure he'd relish the opportunity, but so are the other guys. So that's down to the manager.

'It's always daunting when you're in the squad for the first time, even if you' re in fantastic form and I'm sure Harry's no different. He's still a young boy. But he needs to carry on doing what he does at club level. Everyone is aware of him. Everyone knows him. This should be no different. I'm sure he'll do terrifically well if called upon.'

At club level, Cahill has played against him three times this season, winning twice with Chelsea, including the Capital One Cup final, and losing 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day, when Kane scored twice.

'It's hard to talk a young player up too much because we do that a lot in this country, but for me he has everything,' said Cahill. 'He can hold the ball up, he runs in behind, he has two good feet, he can head, he can finish, he has a bit of pace and physically he is strong enough.

'For me, the attributes a striker needs are all there. It's about how he progresses. He comes across as a top professional.'

The England players tried to make the transition smooth for Kane when he arrived at St George's Park on Monday. 'You introduce yourself and we train together,' said Cahill.

Sturridge's thigh injury leaves Hodgson with three recognised strikers. Rooney will start as he closes in on Sir Bobby Charlton's England goal record after two goals in Scotland, in November, and Danny Welbeck performed well, scoring twice in a 3-1 win against Slovenia, three days before.

Michael Carrick is hoping the manager plays with a diamond because it will better suit the midfielder

If Hodgson sticks with the diamond midfield formation, which has served him well since he introduced it for the first qualifier in Switzerland, he will have to choose between Kane and Welbeck to partner the captain up front.

This shape suits Sterling, in behind the strikers, and Michael Carrick, in front of the centre-halves, with Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph providing the mileage on either side.

Delph has been ill and is yet to train with England this week but he reported to the camp yesterday.

Another option Hodgson will consider, especially if Delph is below full power, is a 4-2-3-1 system with Henderson deep in tandem with Carrick and Kane up front, ahead of Welbeck, Rooney and Sterling.

'We've played a diamond enough times at Manchester United,' said Carrick. 'That's not to say it's the only position I can play, but it's a formation that would probably suit me. Hopefully it will.'
