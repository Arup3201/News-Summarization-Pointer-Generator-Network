A teenager literally 'took the bus' when he stole an elementary school vehicle just moments after being released from a Georgia prison. 

Jonathan Cole Collins, of Flintstone, stole the yellow school bus to drive himself home after leaving Catoosa County Jail, WRBC-TV reports. 

The 18-year-old, who had served two weeks jail time for a misdemeanor drug charge, was caught on camera in his audacious theft just minutes after leaving his jail cell on Sunday.

Next stop jail? Jonathan Collins, 18, was filmed stealing a yellow school bus by on board cameras, left and right. The teenager was walking home for jail when he stole the vehicle

Smile for the camera: The entire theft of the school bus was caught by the vehicle's on-board security cameras leading to Collins immediate arrest

The former prisoner didn't realize the entire incident was being filmed via the on-board security camera.

The footage released by local police shows Collins wearing a cap and bagging clothing climbing on board the bus at Battlefield Elementary School.

He had spotted the keys had been left in the ignition by the driver and decided to take his chances.

Glancing around Collins is filmed fastening his seat-belt and beginning his 20 minute ride home.

He parked it in a school near his home unaware that the entire incident was filmed and ready to watch when police arrived.

Taking the bus: Jonathan Collins, left, drove the school bus for 20 miles to his home before dropping it at a nearby school. He had just left jail after serving two weeks on a drug charge

Abandoned: Jonathan Collins abandoned the school bus near his home but was discovered as the thief when police watched back the on-board security camera footage

According to officers he said he was 'cold and tired' on his walk home.

'He (Collins) was arrested on Jan. 18 at the Cloud Springs Lodge on a
drug charge and had just been released on his own recognizance before 
the bus theft took place,” detective James Leamon said.

'He stated that he had walked into Fort Oglethorpe from the Catoosa 
County Detention Center, and was getting 
tired. He saw the open bus door, the keys inside, and decided that he 
wasn’t going to walk anymore.'

He now faces an even longer jail sentence than the one he was returning home from. 

'It was just a simple matter of him wanting to get from point A to point
B,' Leamon said.

'But now you’ve got a kid who served two weeks for a 
misdemeanor drug charge, and now he’s right back in there on a felony 
charge.'

He has been charged with theft and faces up to a year in prison and a $1000 fine.
