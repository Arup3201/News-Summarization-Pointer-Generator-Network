A bin lorry driver was killed by his vehicle after it crushed him against a wall as he tried to stop it rolling out of a car park.

The 58-year-old man was pinned against a wall after the waste truck started rolling across the road before it mounted a pavement in South Queensferry, near Edinburgh, yesterday afternoon.

The lorry, which is owned by waste management company Biffa, crashed into the back of a Jaguar X-Type before careering through railings and before coming to rest hanging over the edge of a pier.

Staff from a nearby pub rushed to help the driver before emergency services reached the scene to take him to hospital - but the man, who is yet to be named, later died from his injuries. 

Councillor Norman Work, who represents Edinburgh's Almond ward, said: 'It's a tragic accident. It appears that the driver was trying to prevent the accident from happening.

'It's tragic but could have been a lot worse. We are grateful no one else was injured, because it's a very busy area round the whole promenade.

'Obviously our thoughts go out to the family of the driver.' 

Waste management company Biffa  said its employees were shocked at the driver's death, adding the firm would carry out an investigation.

A spokesman said: 'This tragic incident has shocked everyone at Biffa and we send our heartfelt condolences to the family and close friends.

'Naturally, we will work with the police to try and understand the circumstances behind the incident, whilst also carrying out our own full internal investigation.'

A spokeswoman for the Hawes Inn said: 'Our team helped out as much as they could in the moments after the accident happened and contacted the emergency services.

'We are fully cooperating with the police investigation and our thoughts are very much with the driver's family.'

Police in Edinburgh are now appealing for witnesses of the tragic accident to come forward.

Sergeant Brian Smith, of Police Scotland's Edinburgh Road Policing Unit, said: 'This tragic accident happened as the driver tried to stop his lorry from rolling out of the car park of the Hawes Inn.

The bin lorry began rolling across the road, crashed into a Jaguar X-Type (pictured) and through railings

'He was crushed against the wall by the lorry, which then hit a parked Jaguar car before rolling across the road and mounting the pavement, demolishing a bench and fencing before it came to rest hanging over the edge of the pier.

'Although this is a busy road, with a number of pedestrians in the area at the time, fortunately no one else was injured.

'We are carrying out a full investigation and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to us, to call Police Scotland on 101.'
