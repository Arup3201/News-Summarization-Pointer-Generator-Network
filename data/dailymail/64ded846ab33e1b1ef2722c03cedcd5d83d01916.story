A company in Florida has applied to trademark the words 'Je Suis Charlie' to use on clothes, footwear, bags, crockery and babygrows.

Latin American Trading Group has tabled a bid to own the phrase, contending that 'no other person has the right to use the mark in commerce.' 

The slogan, first tweeted by French artist Joachim Roncin, became a rallying cry in support of free speech after 12 people were shot dead at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7

Private property? A U.S. trading firm has applied to own the phrase 'Je Suis Charlie' to print on products

It is believed the magazine was targeted after printing a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad.

Minutes after the news broke, Roncin tweeted a picture that he had fashioned - conflating the Charlie Hebdo logo with the phrase used in the French version of Where's Waldo.

The white-and-gray image rapidly spread around the world, and within 24 hours it had been used in songs, on posters and on even a Simpsons cartoon.

The first Charlie Hebdo edition after the massacre pictured a tearful Prophet Muhammad holding a sign that read 'Je Suis Charlie'.

And once the magazine's website went back online, after a brief hiatus, the strapline read: 'Je Suis Charlie'. 

Latin American Trading Group, registered to a two-bedroom apartment in Aventura, near Miami, filed the $975 application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office just nine days after the massacre at the hands of brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi.

It outlines three classes of goods they plan to use the slogan for.

The products would include clothing, footwear, bowls, dishes, salt and pepper shakers, lunch boxes, coasters, wallets and briefcases, according to The Smoking Gun.

Though it is believed to be the first U.S. application, it comes after hundreds around the world.

France’s Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle (INPI) has already turned down at least 124 trademarks applications from French firms - two of which planned to print the phrase on weapons.

Other applications have come from an Australian fashion designer and a Belgian businessman wanting to put the words on beer bottles and Christmas baubles.

'Frankly, I'm really hurt by everything that has happened with people wanting to make money out of it. Especially because it profoundly devalues the meaning of the slogan,' Roncin told AFP.

How it started: It was first designed and tweeted by French artist Joachim Roncin then went around the globe

Products: This 12" action figure, available online for $139, is being sold to promote press freedom. All profits will go to Charlie Hebdo and the non-profit organization Reporters Without Borders

Since the attack, which sent shockwaves around the world, people have been seen sporting t-shirts, badges, and wristbands with the phrase.

Melanie Griffiths stepped out on Friday wearing a 'Je Suis Charlie' t-shirt.

Amal Clooney proudly pinned a 'Je Suis Charlie' badge to her clutch bag at the Golden Globes.

And this week, an action figure was created to fund Reporters Without Borders and went on sale online for $139.

Latin American Trading Group did not specify whether it has already used the trademark on any products.
