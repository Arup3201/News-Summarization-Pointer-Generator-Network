An Australian family says a government-appointed panel's decision could determine whether one of them lives of dies.

Shane Raisher, 32, from Frankston, Victoria is paying $10,500 every three weeks for a 'magic' drug that could keep him alive to see his two-year-old boy Jett and unborn baby grow up.

The 'wonder drug' MK-3475 has worked miracles in fending off Mr Raisher's aggressive melanoma, which he has fought since getting a mole tested when he was 18.

But the Raisher family said they are 'going broke' and are only able to afford the drug because of community donations.

They are pleading with the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Council to list the drug on the Pharmaceutical Benefits scheme, which would make it radically more affordable.

Mr Raisher's condition has improved when he has taken MK-3475, with his tumours reducing in size

'Please don't let me die of melanoma waiting for this cancer drug to be approved,' Shane writes in a Change.org petition. 

Shane's occasional use of the drug has dramatically improved his quality of life, allowing him to go to work and feel much more energetic. 

According to Ms Raisher, Shane's love for his young son Jett which is powering him through a difficult time in his life. 

'Jett is definitely Shane's motivation - if he's got anything to fight, he's got Jett,' she told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday.  

'It's very daunting for him to see his dad in hospital. He's a very caring little boy. 

'He always asks "Daddy, are you better? Daddy are you better? 

'It's hard, it's hard on everyone.'

The community has rallied behind the family in the past two years, raising more than $85,000 to cover the costs of the tumour-reducing drug for the struggling young family. 

Jett's childcare centre even raised $5,000 for the family. 

The advisory council considers the safety, clinical effectiveness and value for money in judging PBS submissions.

'We're praying as hard as we can,' Ms Raisher told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday.

'If the government doesn't approve it - I just think they'd be crazy not to approve it. 

'You'd be saving so many people's lives.'

PBAC will publish its decision in April.
