Debra Richardson, 49, has been sacked by Travelodge after she was attacked by a robber - because she left the door open

A Travelodge worker who was attacked during a robbery has been sacked - because she left the hotel door open.

Debra Richardson, 49, was dragged to the floor by a man who walked into the Preston Central Travelodge and stole a petty cash box containing £48 in the early hours of the morning.

The robber fled the scene and Ms Richardson, a mother of four, was treated for shock.

She had worked 13 days in a row, totalling 85 hours, and was feeling unwell.

She said she has since suffered from post-traumatic stress and has been put on anti-depressants.

Following the robbery, Ms Richardson took a planned week's holiday but returned to be told she was being investigated because she had left the door unlocked.

The investigation led to a disciplinary hearing and the mother-of-four was sacked.

She appealed against the decision but this week learned the decision had been upheld.

Ms Richardson, of Ribbleton, Lancashire, said: 'This bloke came in, I had left the front door open, I was mentally and physically ill from working all these hours without a day off.

'We have to give six hours’ notice if phoning in sick but because I didn’t have time to give notice I went in and tried to get cover but nobody could cover me.

'He came in I thought he was in the hotel, I asked him if he was all right, I was there on my own.

'He looked like a normal customer, I went into the office and the next thing I was on the floor in the office and he took the petty cash box with £48 in.

'I rang the police straight away and the police rang the management. I was in complete shock.'

Ms Richardson, who worked behind the bar and reception, said: 'I just think it is disgusting, I have worked there for six-and-a-half years.

'I feel absolutely disgusted, I used to cover every shift that needed to be covered. They could ring me and within half an hour I would be in work, I was never off sick.'

She was checked over by paramedics following the robbery, which happened at about 2.40am on Thursday, June 6.

She said: 'Five hours later they rang me to see how I was, I was in shock. I never heard anything because I had a week holiday.

'Then I came in to see what shift I was on and I was told I was on investigation because I hadn’t locked the door.

'I told everybody how ill I was. I went to the investigation a couple of days later and was told it was going to disciplinary.

The robbery took place at Preston Central Travelodge in the early hours of Thursday, June 6

'That was another meeting with different managers from HR. It took them a week to let me know I had been sacked. I appealed it but they are upholding the decision.

'They know I wasn’t involved. They have CCTV of the fella who did it. I told the police everything I could.'

A Travelodge spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a robbery did take place at our Preston Central Travelodge on June 6.

'In response to this incident a comprehensive investigation was carried out by Lancashire Police and their key findings revealed that a member of staff was guilty of a serious breach of security.

'Travelodge operates a zero tolerance against any actions that could impact the welfare or safety of its customers and staff and therefore appropriate action was taken in response to the police findings.'

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said nobody has yet been arrested for the robbery and the investigation continues.
