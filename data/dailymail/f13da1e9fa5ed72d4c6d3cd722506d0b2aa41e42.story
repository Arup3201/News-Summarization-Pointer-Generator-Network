Michael Gove accused teaching unions of adopting a ‘twisted, militant logic’ to justify strikes that closed nearly 3,000 schools yesterday.

The Education Secretary said it was bizarre that the NUT and NASUWT were striking over plans for performance-related pay that will see the best teachers paid more.

Speaking at the Conservative Party conference, Mr Gove angrily hit out at the unions as the  ‘enemies of promise’, saying they had selfishly ‘put their ideology before pupils’ interests’.

He added: ‘While we gather here today, the leaders of the militant teaching unions have gone out on strike.

'And the reason that they have gone out on strike, in a new example of a twisted militant logic, is that they want to stop good teachers being paid more money.

‘They are striking against... the growth and potential of poor children.’

His comments came as 2,703 schools were closed as a result of industrial action. Tens of thousands of children missed classes after 49 local authorities in the east of England, the East Midlands, West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside, were affected.

Mr Gove savaged claims by union leaders that they were implementing ‘child-friendly industrial action’, saying: ‘There is nothing child-friendly about industrial action.

‘Children lose a day of education, parents have to scrabble to pay more for expensive child care and the prestige of the teaching profession, which we all want to see reinforced and built up, takes a knock.

‘I have a simple message for the 
leaders of the teaching unions: Please, please, please don’t put your 
ideology before our children’s interests.’

The
 Department for Education said only 29 per cent of schools in the 
affected regions were closed. Figures for partially closed schools were 
not available.

A spokesman said: ‘The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible.

‘In
 spite of this, thanks to many hard-working teachers and heads, only a 
third of schools in the targeted regions were closed today.’

Thousands
 of chanting members of the NUT and NASUWT took to the streets of 
Sheffield, Birmingham and Cambridge to voice their anger over changes to
 pay, pensions and work conditions.Among them were children carrying banners with slogans, including ‘Save my future’, ‘Protect my teachers’ and ‘Gove out’.

But
 angry parents said they had been forced to alter plans or pay for child
 care. Lisa Chambers, a councillor in charge of education at Tory-led 
Suffolk County Council, said she had to take her 13-year-old son Alex to
 meetings. 

Strike action: More than 2,700 schools closed yesterday as teachers held strikes over plans to introduce performance-related pay

‘Unfortunately we don’t have any 
grandparents close to us and friends have got to make arrangements for 
their own children,’ she said. ‘I have a diary of commitments to people 
and I really don’t feel I can let people down because of this strike.’

The
 strike was the third of four one-day regional walk-outs, which will be 
followed by nationwide industrial action before Christmas. The next will
 affect London, the North East, South East and South West on October 17.

Christine
 Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said she was sorry for the 
disruption but added: ‘The Government’s refusal to engage in meaningful 
talks has led to the NUT and NASUWT taking strike action.’

Low turn-out meant that less than a quarter of the unions’ members originally voted for industrial action.

It came as a former American teachers’ union leader from Washington DC urged his British counterparts to think again about opposing reforms.

George Parker said unions spent too much time trying to defend bad teachers and opposing reforms that would help children.

Mr Parker, who received a standing ovation at the Tory conference yesterday, said: ‘Performance pay can work. It’s working in Washington DC.’

Praising the free schools and academies programmes, he said: ‘The concept of removing the bureaucracy that schools have to go through is an excellent idea. I am going to go back to America and get into trouble with my union buddies by talking about these things.’

Firebrand: NUT General Secretary Christine Blower said Gove left teachers with no choice but to strike

By RICHARD PENDLEBURY 

Christine Blower doesn’t like grammar schools, free schools, academy status, streaming, Ofsted or league tables. It goes without saying that public schools give her apoplexy.

But what really makes her red flag fly high is Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Yesterday morning, as Mr Gove prepared to deliver his speech – she doesn’t like the Conservatives either – the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers made a defiant statement of rebellion which led to thousands of schools in  England staying shut for the day.

For the strike was orchestrated by the self-styled ‘miner’s daughter’ from that hard-graft, clogs and whippets pit town of Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey.

‘No teacher takes strike action lightly, but the intransigence of this Education Secretary has left teachers with no choice,’ Ms Blower huffed.

And yet industrial action has been a hallmark of her leadership of the NUT. One of her predecessors even said she was someone ‘for whom strike action is the only solution to problems’.

As if to prove this, Ms Blower’s first task on assuming the top job in 2008 was to lead the membership on their own first national walk-out for two decades.

Yesterday’s was simply part of the latest series of school stoppages which will continue until Christmas holidays, as she battles Mr Gove’s plans to introduce performance-related pay, and increase pension contributions and workload.

If her own salary was the result of a performance-related calculation then she would surely be doing a brilliant job. At a reported £154,000 a year including pension top-ups, the Blower pay packet compares very favourably with the Prime Minister’s £142,000 per annum. Poor Mr Gove’s salary is a good £20,000 less than Ms Blower’s, but then she would no doubt argue that he is doing a useless job.

Her considerable renumeration package sits a little uneasily with her own far-left political views which had made her a controversial figure within teaching, even before becoming NUT leader.

While she would later decry the two-tier system, Ms Blower was educated in the grammar rather than secondary modern stream of a local state school.

Having considered a career in the probation service, she decided on teaching. Her first post was teaching French at Holland Park comprehensive school, dubbed the ‘socialist Eton’.

It had just done away with streaming, which was just fine by the new mistress, who recalled: ‘Any class has a range of abilities but, in streaming or setting, there’s a risk you don’t realise that and treat them all as though they’re exactly the same. In mixed ability, you know you need the teaching style and the materials to hit the whole range.’

Her subsequent career took her to other west London schools and she ultimately became a full-time official of the NUT. Her membership dates back to her entry into the profession. By the 1980s she was a local official before being elected to the National Executive in 1992.

But what were her own politics? Her Labour Party membership lapsed some two decades ago, and by 1999 she was telling the Guardian newspaper she was ‘to the left of Old Labour’

That was the year she first stood for general secretary, against the incumbent Doug McAvoy, who warned members that she had ‘a political and revolutionary platform’ that she ‘seeks to impose on members’. He even took out an advertisement claiming his opponent was ‘controlled by a group of extreme Left organisations including Militant’. Ms Blower lost heavily.

In 2005 she was elected as NUT deputy general secretary and, three years later, stepped up when the then leader Steve  Sinnott, died. Since then she has been ‘militating’ as she puts it, rather than Militant.

Her private actions in terms of how her own children are educated have not always been consistent.

She stopped one of her two daughters from sitting SATs at the ages of  seven and 11 in protest, but  allowed the other to take them because the girl did not want to be ‘singled out’.

It was also reported in a newspaper blog that one of her daughters was sent to a high-performing state school outside her home borough. Ms Blower appears to have neither confirmed or denied the report.

‘You have to make different decisions about different children, regardless of your politics,’ she has argued, referring to her decision about the SATs.

That might sound a little  hollow to the parents of the children at the schools she closed yesterday.
