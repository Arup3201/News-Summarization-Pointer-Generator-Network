 One woman with a rare condition called optic neuritis says that liposuction not only helped her lose weight, stopped her from going blind.

Julia Matsumoto was diagnosed with a rare condition called optic neuritis that caused her to go completely blind at the age of 31.

A liposuction procedure that involved extracting stem cells from Matsumoto's fat and placing them back in her body helped Matsumoto regain her vision in four days.

Julia Matsumoto thought she'd never be able to see again but a rare stem cell therapy involving liposuction helped her regain her vision in less that three days

Doctors performed liposuction on Julia's stomach and then harvested the stem cells in her fat

According to Medical News Today, 'Adult stem cells can divide or self-renew indefinitely, enabling them to generate a range of cell types from the originating organ or even regenerate the entire original organ.'

'It was the size of a pin drop and eventually, eventually complete darkness,' told CBS of her onset of blindness.

When a doctor placed Matsumoto on the steroid presidone, it helped to restore some of her vision but it also made her gain more than 100 pounds in three months.

'It got to the point where I couldn’t walk. I couldn’t enjoy my life,' she said of the weight gain.

Doctors searched for alternatives to steroids and what they found was a rare liposuction procedure involving stem cell therapy not yet approved by the FDA.

'As a cosmetic surgeon, I’ve been harvesting fat to throw it out because people want to get rid of it. Now, I tell people who come for liposuction, ‘Don’t be so quick, your fat is loaded with stem cells,’ Dr. Mark Berman told CBS.

There is a debate as to whether it was the steroids or the stem cells that helped Matsumoto gain her vision back but doctors are extremely excited about the nearly miraculous recovery.

'Your fat is loaded with stem cells,' said Dr. Mark Berman, who performed the procedure
