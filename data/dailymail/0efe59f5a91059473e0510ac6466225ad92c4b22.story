A gardener who was bed-ridden for three weeks after an injury excavating a vegetable patch has invented a double-handed spade which he claims takes the back-breaking work out of digging.

Ivan Williams, 71, came up with the odd-looking angled design after trapping his sciatic nerve while gardening last year.

Ivan, a 
former judge on TV show Scrapheap Challenge, spent weeks in his 
workshop building and testing prototypes as soon as he could stand again.

'I couldn’t believe that in all the 
thousands of years the spade has been around, no-one had come up with a 
better design,' he said.

In contrast to the back bending and twisting involved in using a conventional spade, Mr Williams’ invention lets him dig in an upright standing position. 

It is made possible by double handles and a unique angled design that allows him to use his upper thigh and hip as a pivot point to lever the soil out of the ground without straining his back.

Mr Williams, from Minsterley in Shropshire, said: 'I know my design looks a little bit unusual but it makes gardening so much easier, especially for older people who could remain active in the garden for many more years.

'I can dig like this all day with very little strain now that I don’t have to do all of that bending and twisting.

'You do still have to "dig", pushing the spade in with the foot, but then you pull back – using the body as a fulcrum – take the upper handle, lift up, put the soil where you need it and then use the lower handle to turn the soil over and break it up.

'It’s just as fast at digging as a conventional spade, if not faster!'

Mother of invention: Ivan Williams came up with his labour-saving spade design after injuring his back digging

Mr Williams came up with the idea after he badly hurt his back while digging his vegetable patch with a conventional spade last spring.

'I’d dug about two rows, I went to turn and then my back went. It locked up and went into spasm. I was in agony,' he said.

'I’d trapped my sciatic nerve and had to spend three weeks incapacitated, on strong painkillers. I was so furious it got me thinking about the spade and how it could be redesigned to stop this sort of thing happening. My back still hasn’t fully recovered 10 months later.'

Mr Williams, an armour and weapons expert for the documentary series Battlefield Detectives, was an art and design lecturer before getting into TV and film work.

He appeared in early shows of Scrapheap Challenge – judging contraptions made from air compressors and old bicycles  – and has worked on documentaries such as Leonardo’s Dream Machines, Rescue Emergency, The Iranian Embassy Siege and Gladiatrix, the Discovery Channel’s programme about female gladiators. He also designed weapons and armour for the movie Aliens 3.

His prototype spade is built from a carbon steel blade, a tubular steel shaft and a synthetic moulded section shaped to fit comfortably against the thigh.

Step forward: An expert said the new spade design invented by Mr Williams could be 'an important step forward to safer and less tiring digging'

The spade can be stored in two pieces and the blade attachment might easily be replaced with a fork or a weed puller.

Mr Williams, who has made a video of his spade in action, is now looking for a manufacturer to take his design to the next level.

Dr Les Duckers, postgraduate research director at Coventry University, who has seen the video, believes the spade could be 'an important step forward to safer and less tiring digging'.

'Ivan’s spade gives a clear advantage in terms of posture. It’s used with a straight back, which would significantly reduce effort. In contrast, the bending and twisting needed to use a conventional spade creates significant postural strain which is both tiring and dangerous and carries an acknowledged risk of spinal injury,' he said.

Dr Adam Al-Kashi, Head of Research and Education, back pain charity BackCare, said: 'The vast majority of back pain is stress-induced like the vast majority of headache, and does not relate to any physical damage, disease or dysfunction.

'Digging with a conventional spade should not cause injury or persistent pain in healthy people. However, since kinesiophobia [fear of movement] is a known barrier to back pain recovery, anything that helps people get back to normal activity is better than avoiding activity altogether.

Ivan’s previous small-scale inventions include a survival knife that he designed with the survival specialist Lofty Wiseman, a simple-to-use etching press for schools and colleges, and a multi-purpose wheelbarrow that is supposed to make loading and unloading easier.
