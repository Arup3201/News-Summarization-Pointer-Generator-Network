One of the world’s ugliest creatures could hold the key to beating chronic pain, scientists believe.

The star-nosed mole, which boasts a bizarre snout fringed by 22 waggling tentacles that are highly sensitive to touch, could lead to new painkillers for people whose lives are blighted by arthritis and other conditions that leave them in constant pain.

The tiny creature, native to North America, lives underground in almost total darkness and so relies on its nose to ‘see’.

Potential: The star-nosed mole, which boasts a bizarre snout fringed by 22 waggling tentacles that are highly sensitive to touch, could lead to new painkillers being developed

The points of the ‘star’ rapidly survey the floors and walls of its tunnels for tasty worms and grubs, much in the same way as a blind person uses a cane to hunt out obstacles.

After hitting on a tasty morsel, the mole, which weighs less than a bag of sugar, takes just 230 milliseconds to decide if it is edible and gobble it down.

Quicker than the blink of an eye, this is less than half the time a motorists needs to begin braking on seeing a red light, and makes the creatures one of the fastest eaters on the planet.

The centre of its snout is particularly responsive to touch, with more than 100,000 nerve endings packed into an area one centimetre square, making it the most sensitive patch of mammalian skin known to man.

Now, scientists are starting to unravel the secrets of its remarkable nose, in the hope of helping people whose bodies are extra-sensitive to pain and for whom current drugs offer little benefit.

A study of star-nosed moles caught in Pennsylvania pinpointed genes thought to be key to feeling touch and pain.

Receptors: University of California researcher Diana Bautista said: ¿By studying the star-nosed mole, we have identified candidate genes that may mediate touch and pain'

If the same mechanism is at play in the human body, it be exploited to develop new treatments for persistent pain, the journal PLoS ONE reports.

University of California researcher Diana Bautista said: ‘By studying the star-nosed mole, we have identified candidate genes that may mediate touch and pain.

‘These genes represent new potential targets for the development of much-needed drugs and therapies to treat chronic pain.’

Chronic pain often takes the form of headaches, back ache or neck pain and can be caused by an injury, cancer or arthritis. However, it some cases, it has no obvious cause.

Millions of Britons suffer pain almost daily, with almost 8 million working days a year lost to back ache alone.
