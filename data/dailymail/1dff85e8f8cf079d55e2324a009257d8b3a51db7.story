Moving on: A happy and relieved Ryan Corr exits from court after pleading guilty and receiving a 12-month good behaviour bond for possession of heroin. Police who arrested the film and TV actor in a Sydney laneway in May say the 25-year-old 'dropped a small tied freezer bag containing a white powder' which Corr admitted 'being heroin and that it was for his personal use'. The actor said on Monday he was 'looking forward to getting back to work'

Former Packed to the Rafters actor and rising film star Ryan Corr, 25, arrived at Waverley local court to face drug charges three months after he was found in a back street in Sydney's Eastern suburbs with .26 gram of heroin in a tied off freezer bag. Corr was traumatised at the time from his grandfather's heart attack, his lawyer Christ Murphy says

Actor Ryan Corr missed an earlier appearance at Waverley Court a month before he turned up (pictured) with lawyer Chris Murphy to plead guilty to possessing heroin, due to filming commitments in the UK where the 25-year-old was shooting scenes for the convict drama, Banished, set in 18th century England when its was setting up Australia as a penal colony

Police found Corr in Castlefield Lane, Bondi, in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs with heroin in a freezer bag.

The court heard Corr had purchased .26 grams of heroin at a Bondi hotel.

But Corr's lawyer Chris Murphy argued that a conviction would significantly impact his career. 

'He has a contract for a major movie,' he told the court. 'He is at the top of his brilliant career.'

Mr Murphy has also tendered 11 character references, including one from award-winning actress Jacqueline McKenzie.

They also included production member of Wolf Creek 2, Jocelyn Moorhouse of the Sydney Theatre company as well as unnamed Hollywood film figures, one of whom described Corr as a future 'Al Pacino or Steve Buscemi'.

Corr has had roles in Underbelly: The Golden Mile, Love Child and Blue Water High.

Scene of the crime: Ryan Corr had only just left a Bondi hotel where a man offered him a small amount of heroin, saying 'take this and you will feel okay' and walked 200 metres to Castlefield Lane, Bondi pictured, above) where police apprehended hima nd observed the young actor to drop a small tied off freezer bag with .26g of white powder, which proved to be heroin. Corr had only just returned from Melbourne to see his grandfather who had suffered a cardiac arrest and was not expected to live, his lawyer told Waverley Court

Magistrate Julie Huber said she accepted that Corr was not a heroin user and had only taken the .26g of the drug in a plastic bag and gone to Castlefield Lane (pictured, above) because he was in a state following the heart attack suffered by his grandfather, Don, who had been a big influence in his life following his parents' divorce when he was nine years old

Castlefield Lane, where Ryan Corr was followed and arrested by police who believed he was in possession of an illegal drug - which proved to be .26g of heroin -  runs parallel to Bondi Rd and is in close proximity to a school

Rubbish piles up on the side of the road on Castlefield Lane, near where actor Ryan Corr - who has appeared in more than 450 TV, play and film acting roles - was found after he walked there from a hotel where a man gave him heroin to help ease his distress over his grandfather's health

He is set to star alongside Russell Crowe in the film, The Water Diviner.

But Mr Murphy said Corr had never taken heroin and any drug conviction could ruin his future brilliant career.

'There is no suggestion that this man has ever injected with a needle in his arm or used heroin,' he told the court.

Mr Murphy, quoting an unnamed Hollywood-based director who had worked with actress Brooke Shields, said Corr was  'brilliant' and 'asked for consideration to kepping his record clean' saying that in the 'US and Hollywood,  the centre of film ... any blemish on his slate can spell disaster for his career'.

Mr Murphy said Corr was distraught about his grandfather's near fatal heart attack at the time he was caught with heroin.

Mr Murphy said the actor had been filming the convict drama Banished in Sydney when his grandfather Don Corr collapsed on a Melbourne street in cardiac arrest.

'He had a close relationship with his grandfather,' he said.

Corr is best known for his character in Packed to the Rafters, but has also had roles in Underbelly: The Golden Mile, Love Child and Wolf Creek 2 (pictured) in which he played opposite John Jarratt in the Australia's biggest grossing film of the last year

Five days after his arrest, Ryan Corr won a Best Performance award at the Madrid International Fantastic Film Festival for his role in the thriller Wolf Creek 2 opposite John Jarratt (the two are pictured in a scene from the film) playing a backpacker who comes into the clutches of the merciless serial killer played by Jarratt .

'His parents divorced when he was nine.  His grandfather was his guiding light.

'He was on the set filming in Sydney. His grandfather was expected to die.'

Mr Murphy said Corr took a quick flight to Melbourne on May 24 and grandfather Don was taken 'out of an induced coma to say goodbye'.

Three days later, he went to Fletcher Street Bondi to check on the tenant of a bedsit he had bought and then visited a hotel where a man gave him the .26 gram of heroin.

The man told Corr, ' take this, you will feel okay'.

He then 'walked 200 metres' and was arrested.

Ryan Corr's good character, kindness, outstanding acting ability and glittering future were laid out in 11 references or letters tendered on his behalf from:

Mr Murphy said Corr was ' grateful in an odd way for his arrest, telling his lawyer that 'it stopped me doing something ... that's not me'.

In a bizarre reference as to why the magistrate should not 'blemish' Corr's career and 'needs to keep his record clean' because it would affect his employment as an actor in the US and Canada,  Mr Murphy cited an alleged incident involving the Prime Minister.  

He said Tony Abbott had ' burnt a bus stop to the ground and was charged with malicious damage of property' but had no recorded conviction.

Magistrate Julie Huber told Corr that she accepted his grandfather's heart attack had made him 'vulnerable' and that 'a conviction would affect your employment in the future'.

The actor's father, who works at the Rossbourne school for special needs children in Melbourne said as he left court he was ' always proud' of his son and 'I think his career will speak for itself'.

A smiling Ryan Corr also said he was 'pleased the charge has been dismissed and I am looking forward to getting back to work'. 

A theatre company spokesman told the The Sydney Morning Herald the young actor requested release from the production 'and his departure from the show is not related in any way' to his arrest. 

Corr said he was leaving because he had been cast in a leading role in a film, understood to be Holding Man directed by Neil Armfield.

Ryan Corr was photographed last year walking around Sydney's Kings Cross area, pictured here lighting a cigarettes while while seated beside a blue bag at the bus stop

Corr stayed on the move  and spent much of his time on the phone, pacing up and down the street

Later the actor picked up the blue bag he had with him and was on the move again along the Kings Cross street

Pictures and video footage of Corr also emerged from May last year of him smoking, pacing back and forth and talking on his phone near a bus stop in Sydney's Kings Cross.

'The man was allegedly in possession of a small amount of a prohibited drug,' New South Wales police told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was confirmed the substance was heroin and he was found with one freezer bag containing white powder, the court documents said.

On June 2 he tweeted that he was heading to the UK for three months and asked fellow social media users for their suggestion on neighbouring countries to visit while he's away.

Variety described the up-and-comer as 'a strong, witty match for the affably repulsive Jarratt in their scenes together.'

A former CLEO Bachelor of the Year nominee and recipient of the Heath Ledger Scholarship, Corr has also held roles in Love Child and Underbelly: The Golden Mile.

Still active: Two days after the arrest Ryan was back on social media, re-tweeting a message from a fan
