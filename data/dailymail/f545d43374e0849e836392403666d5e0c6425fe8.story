For some parents, persuading their children to eat fruit and vegetables can be an arduous task.

But not for the parents of toddler Max Billingham who lives on a diet of carrots, potatoes and bananas.

The two-year-old, from Felling in Gateshead, has a rare condition which means he is allergic to almost all foods.

He risks going into shock, turning blue and ending up in hospital if he eats anything else.

Two year old Max Billington, from Felling in Gateshead, was diagnosed with food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) and dysmotility of the bowel as a baby meaning he is allergic to most foods

Max, who is allergic to all foods other than potatoes, carrots and bananas, has recently undergone surgery to have a feeding pump fitted to get food into his body 

Doctors diagnosed Max with the allergy when he was a baby. 

But since then the list of foods he is allergic to, which currently includes chicken, blueberries and rice, grows by the day. 

Max lives on a special milk formula and has recently had an operation where surgeons inserted a pump, allowing him to be fed for 14 hours a day.  

Max's mother, Laura Billingam said it is a difficult condition to manage because her son doesn't understand why he is different from other children.

She said: 'It's really stressful because everything revolves around food.

'A lot of social events include going out for meals or a buffet. He just doesn't understand why he can't have the food.'

Max, who was born eight weeks premature, suffered a severe reaction to milk and foods as a baby prompting doctors to carry out food tests.

Food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome or FPIES is a severe reaction to food proteins that happens one to four hours after a problematic food is ingested.

The condition primarily occurs in infants, with most outgrowing it by the age of three, but it can also exist in adults and older children.

At its most extreme, the allergy sparks vomiting, diarrhoea and a shock-like state. The exact cause within the body is unknown.

The most common problem foods are milk and soy protein, but rice, chicken, oats, peanuts, potato and fish are also known to have caused problems.

The condition is often missed by paediatricians because it does not spark the usual immune response and is not traceable through typical allergy tests. Skin prick tests for allergies come up negative. 

He was diagnosed with the rare condition food protein induced enterocolitis (FPIES) and dysmotility of the bowel as a baby.

His family say his disease has baffled doctors and he is the only child in the North East they know to be living with both conditions.

'Some of the doctors haven't even heard of it,' said Mrs Billington, a children's nurse.

'To look at him you wouldn't think anything was wrong but he's really ill and we're constantly in and out of hospital.'

This week Max was fitted with a feeding pump which will be used to get food into his body, and he will remain in hospital for another eight weeks.

Although he may grow out of the disorder as he gets older, he might have to live with the feeding pump for the rest of his life.

Mrs Billington and husband Scott, 33, a driving instructor, will soon make the trip to specialist hospital Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, where experts will assess Max's condition.

The couple, who are also parents to four-year-old Halle, said it is a very difficult time for the family but they want to raise awareness of Max's condition.

Mrs Billington said she is constantly worried abouther son suffering an allergic reaction.

She said: 'It's a case of trial and error and often you don't know what foods have caused his reaction as sometimes the chronic reaction can be delayed.

Max' mother Laura Billingham says she is thankful that his nursery school, have been incredibly supportive, taking Max into another room during lunchtimes so an allergic reaction is not triggered

'My daughter once had a biscuit and he ate the tiniest of crumbs and he was poorly. It's a horrible condition and we just want to raise awareness.'

She said that staff at Max's nursery school in Swalwell, Gateshead, have been incredibly supportive.

She said: 'The nursery has been a lifesaver. They take him into a different room when the other children are eating and they've just been a huge support.'

Next week family and friends will take part in a coast to coast cycle race to raise money for ongoing test for Max.
