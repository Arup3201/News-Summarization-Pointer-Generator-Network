The bereaved mother of a 13-year-old boy who was gunned down in Brooklyn, New York, last year has filed a lawsuit against a funeral home claiming that it had used footage from her son's emotional service in an ad without her permission.

Tiffany Orr lost her 13-year-old son, Ronald Wallace, who was shot in the back in Brownsville last August.

The boy was laid to rest in a Cypress Hill cemetery following an intense funeral service attended by Ronald's grief-stricken parents, relatives and friends.

Miss Orr's lawsuit filed this week in Brooklyn Supreme Court alleges that two months later, her other son discovered a video online promoting the ritual services of the Bedford-Stuyvesant funeral parlor Robeson &  Brown that featured shots of her son's coffin.

‘It just brought back memories,’ Orr told the New York Daily News. ‘Just seeing him in a casket — that was just too much. I’m really upset.’

The lawsuit contends that the undertakers have not received consent from Wallace's family to use the video showing the distraught family. 

The controversial clip advertising the mortuary has since been pulled down from the web. Robeson & Brown has not publicly commented on the lawsuit.

The Daily Dot pointed out that there is still a 24-second clip on YouTube showing a snippet of Wallace's gospel service, which was uploaded by the user deanmeminger August 31, 2012.

Just before 1am on August 24, 2012, 13-year-old Ronald Wallace, known by his nickname Ra-Smoove, was hanging out with friends on Tapscott Street in Brownsville when gunfire erupted, according to DNAInfo.com.

The teen was rushed to Brookdale Hospital, where he died from a single gunshot wound to the back.

On August 31, the slain teen's devastated family, friends and members of the community filed into the Universal Temple Church of God to say their final farewells to Ronald, who was remembered as a gifted dancer and promising basketball player.

The New York Daily News described in detail a heart-rending scene where Ronald's mother, Miss Orr, wailed while standing over her son's body, exclaiming: 'My baby got robbed from me!'

In the course of the emotional service, Tiffany Orr was seen throwing herself on her son's casket and embracing his lifeless body until she finally had to be pulled away.

A week later, CBS New York reported that police made an arrest in Wallace's slaying, charging 17-year-old suspected gang member Akbar Johns with second-degree murder and weapons possession.
