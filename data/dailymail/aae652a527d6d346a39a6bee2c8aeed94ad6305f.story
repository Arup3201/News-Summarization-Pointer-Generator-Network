Oscar Garcia set to leave his role as manager of Maccabi Tel Aviv on Tuesday due to the ongoing conflicts in the area.

The former Brighton manager is back at the Israeli club for the second time, after resigning in 2013 and moving to England.

However, with Israel locked in continuing conflict with Hamas in Gaza, and rockets being fired at Tel Aviv, Garcia has decided to leave the region.

He is under consideration at Leeds and Fulham as they consider their options in the face of recent results.

Garcia had a succesful one-year spell in Tel Aviv two seasons ago, culminating in winning the Israeli Championship in 2013. 

But results on his return have been less good, with the club going out of the Champions League qualifiers to Maribor, and needed to overturn a two-goal deficit against Greek side Asteras Tripoli on Thursday to reach the Europa League group stage.
