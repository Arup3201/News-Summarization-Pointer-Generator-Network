At the time hopes for Skinny the 41-pound obese stray cat found roaming the streets of Texas last year didn't look so good.

But in six months' time the orange tabby has shed a remarkable seven pounds while additionally taken into the permanent home and care of his veterinarian, Brittney Barton of Dallas.

In a newly released photo of the tabby seen lounging around Dr. Barton’s home - as well as affectionately in her arms - she reports that Skinny is doing well while on a special diet to help lose weight and increase his metabolism.

Dr Barton says she became attached to the cat - that weighed as much as an average 5-year-old child according to U.S. government growth charts - while treating him at an animal orphanage.

Last month, after a campaign to find Skinny a new home, he became part of her family.

Skinny now joins Dr Barton's husband, three children, a dog and another cat at her Dallas home.

Barton says Skinny gets along great with the other animals, can jump up on a couch and runs - not waddles - to his food bag at feeding time.

She says the house has long hallways that provide good exercise for Skinny.

No doubt Skinny’s rapid and ongoing success is the perfect role model for other fat cats out there.

Though Skinny weighed in an average of 25 pounds more than the average feline, he wasn’t the heaviest kitty on record.

Himmy, the Australian cat, tipped the scales around 47 pounds, according to Guinness World Records, which retired the category to discourage the overfeeding of porky pets - The Dallas Morning News reported.
