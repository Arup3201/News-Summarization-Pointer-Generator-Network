New Mexico police have been accused of violating another man's rights after forcing a driver to undergo an anal probe.

When Timothy Young was stopped on October 13, last year, for a minor traffic offense, a police dog with an expired license indicated that he had drugs on him.

Mr Young, who was then subjected to a digital anal probe that found nothing, is bringing a lawsuit against Hidalgo County police.

He went public with his ordeal after details of the invasive procedures David Eckert, another New Mexico driver, had to endure after falsely being suspected of carrying drugs by the same dog, US News reported.

Albuquerque civil rights attorney Shannon Kennedy, who is representing Mr Eckert, said she is also filing a lawsuit on Mr Young's behalf.

After Mr Young was stopped last year for allegedly turning without a signal, a police dog named Leo that allegedly has an expired license, signaled that he had drugs on him, KOB-TV said.

The driver was taken to Gila Regional Medical Center in Silver City where doctors performed and X-ray and digital anal probe.

It is the same medical center Mr Eckert was taken after being pulled over on January 2, 2013. Mr Eckert claimed he was subjected to 
three enemas, two rectal searches, two X-rays and even a colonoscopy - 
all in pursuit of non-existent narcotics. 

After
 it was done, the hospital that performed all the procedures against his
 will billed him - and threatened to hire a collections agency if 
he didn't pay, he alleged.

Civil rights attorney Ms Kennedy, who is representing both men, claimed the training certificate for Leo the dog had expired and that it had given false alerts before. 

'We have done public requests to find 
anything that would show this dog has been trained, we have evidence 
that this dog has had false alerts in the past,' she said.

Three Deming policemen and three Hidalgo County officers were allegedly involved in Mr Eckert's case, which may be settled out of court.

Lawsuit: David Eckert is also bringing legal action against Gila Regional Medical Center, where the medical procedures were carried out

Named defendants include the six 
police officers, the medical center, two doctors and a deputy district 
attorney who secured a warrant authorizing an anal probe.

No drugs were found in the possession of either man.

A
 member of Hidalgo County Sheriff's office referred questions about the 
case to their attorney's office, which did not immediately respond to a 
request for a comment.

In Mr Eckhert's case, the hospital in question and police have refused to comment on the lawsuit.

KOB-TV reported that Mr Eckert was pulled over on January 2 as he was pulled out of the Walmart in Deming, New Mexico. Officers say he failed to make a complete stop at a stop sign.

They asked Mr Eckert to get out of his car. When he stood, an officer claimed, he was clenching the cheeks of his buttocks - which the officer believed was a sign he was hiding drugs.

That single observation kicked off the horrific cavity searches that kept Mr Eckert in captivity for 14 hours.

'If the officers in Hidalgo County and the City of Deming are seeking warrants for anal cavity searches based on how they're standing and the warrant allows doctors at the Gila Hospital of Horrors to go in and do enemas and colonoscopies without consent, then anyone can be seized and that's why the public needs to know about this,' Ms Kennedy, told the TV station.

After officers noticed Mr Eckert's posture, they called a drug dog, which indicated a smell of narcotics on Mr Eckert's driver seat.

A search of the car revealed no drugs. So, officers held him until a judge issued a warrant authorizing a body cavity search.

First officers took him to Mimbres Memorial Hospital in Deming, but doctors there said the procedures police were requesting were 'unethical' for them to perform, according to court documents.

Then, the officers him across county lines to Gila Regional Medical Center in Silver City. Kennedy argues in the lawsuit that transporting Mr Eckert to another county violated the terms of the search warrant and made the entire search illegal.

Doctors performed a colonoscopy, which involves inserting a camera up his anus and all the way into his large intestine. He had to be sedated for the procedure

Once at Gila Medical Center, according to the lawsuit, doctors put Mr Eckert through several hours of invasive, humiliating searches.

The lawsuit claims that Mr Eckert vocally objected to each search, but doctors performed the procedures anyway.

At the hospital, doctors probed his rectum with their fingers. When they didn't find anything, he was given an X-ray.

When the X-ray came up negative, he was probed again.

Then, he was given an enema and forced to defecate in front of the doctors and police officers and watch as they sifted through his stool.

Doctors then performed a second and third enema. None of the enemas discovered drugs.

He was then X-rayed for a second time.

After the final, X-ray he was sedated and given a colonoscopy, a complex medical procedure that involved the doctors inserting a camera into his anus, rectum, colon, and large intestines.

Finally, after 2am, when the colonoscopy came up negative, he was released without charges, according to the lawsuit.
