You'd expect two young tech entrepreneurs to be aware of the pitfalls of 'over sharing' on the internet.

But Matt Monahan and Jesse Thomas appear to have learned the hard way after Mr Monahan, CEO of AlphaBoost, was filmed naked in an intoxicated state on a beach in India days ahead of a business event.

Mr Thomas then posted the minute-long video 
of the nude romp on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram with the caption: 
'bahahahahahahahaha;.

It was only taken down after Mr Monahan's business partner saw the post and angrily told him: 'We're trying to run a business here!'

Mr Mohanan exposes himself as he struggles to stand up on the beach in India where the business trip is due to start

The video, filmed by his friend Mr Thomas, head of social media advertising firm JESS3, shows Mr Monahan sat nude on the sand giggling and covering his modesty with his hands.

Mr Thomas, a Forbes contributor, asks Mr Monahan: 'What do you like about India?'

Mr Monahan slurs his response: 'I think we should all be friends.'

He then attempts to stand up and falls over, exposing himself, while Mr Thomas makes jokes about his friend's anatomy as his embarrassed girlfriend looks on.

The two businessmen were in India for the Geeks on a Plane event - an invite-only tour for startups, investors, and executives to learn about technology markets worldwide.

They had flown in early ahead of the event, which officially starts today.

Google, PayPal, QualComm and other major firms shell out for the tour to provide networking opportunities for like-minded entrepreneurs, and to enable them to gain insight into local markets and business models.

The website for the project, which was set up by venture capital bigwig Dave McClure, describes one of its aims as being 'to learn about trends in internet, mobile and other tech platforms'.

Mr Thomas posted the minute-long video 
of Monahan's nude romp on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram with the caption: 
'bahahahahahahahaha' and using the official even hashtag '#goap' from the JESS3 company accounts.

Mr Monahan's partner at AlphaBooks, Sam 
Beaudin, sent him an incensed Facebook message saying: 'We're trying to 
run a business here'.

Mr Monahan told Gawker: 'The video does not reflect well, was out of 
context, and Jesse has deleted it. He thought it was funny at the time 
but realized that late nights as friends have don't have a place in the 
public stream.'

Mr Monahan also works as an advisor for Wildfire, a Google subsidiary, and JESS3 is one of AlphaBoost's clients. Mr Monahan is now in the process of trying to sell his company.
