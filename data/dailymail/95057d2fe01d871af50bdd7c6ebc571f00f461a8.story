Samsung has Galaxy Gear, Apple is rumoured to be working on an iWatch and you’ve probably seen the Pebble.

But a new smartwatch on the block claims to be cleverer than its rivals because it offers an experience much closer to using a smartphone.

It can connect to both iOS and Android devices to allow a wearer to make calls and send and receive text messages, as well as offering full web access and a number of other features.

A smartwatch to rule them all?  The Rufus Cuff claims to be cleverer than its rivals because it offers an experience much closer to using a smartphone. It can connect to both iOS and Android devices to allow a wearer to make calls and send and receive text messages, as well as other features

The Rufus Cuff is currently a prototype but will have a 3-inch screen once the Los Angeles-based start-up, Rufus Labs, has raised the cash required to put it into production.

It said: ‘The Rufus Cuff ends the era of the watch and ushers in the Wrist Communicator.’

The watch cannot connect to a phone network on its own, but digitally linked up to a smartphone, users will be able to make and receive voice and video calls plus text messages. Vibrating and light alerts will be used to let users known when they have mail or a call.

‘If you don’t want your call overheard, 
simply switch off the speaker and continue by holding your wrist up to 
your ear or put the call back on your smartphone,’ the firm said.

Loud and clear: The watch has a built-in microphone and camera and runs a full Android operating system (pictured) so wearers can use apps listed on the Google Play store

It has a built-in microphone and camera and runs a full Android operating system so wearers can use apps listed on the Google Play store.

Users will be able to scroll through social media feeds and use popular apps like Skype and WhatsApp, while a full web browser will let them access the internet without restrictions.

It will also have GPS and accelerometer and gyroscope on board so it can support lots of fitness apps and count steps taken, calories burned and distance travelled.

Big and Bold: The Rufus Cuff is currently a prototype but will have a 3-inch screen, once the start-up has raised the cash required to put it into production. Its screen is much larger than that of Samsung's Galaxy Gear and Pebble (pictured) but its designer claims it is more comfortable as weight is more evenly distributed

A Bluetooth connection will allow users to manage music playlists or take photos on their smartphone remotely.

Gabe Grifoni, CEO and co-founder of the start-up told Mashable that he was inspired to create the watch while driving back from CES 2013, having seen plenty of smart watches but thinking that they could be done better.

‘Smartwatches are cool - a good start to where we should be going - but this is where we should be.’

thinking that they could be done better. His design is striking, large (pictured right) and comes in many colour combinations (pictured left)

Mr Grifoni hopes that one day smart watches will replace smartphones and said that while his device has a big screen and is bulky, it is easy to wear – even for small wrists – because the weight is distributed over a greater area.

The Rufus Cuff can be ordered on Indiegogo, where it is priced at $239 (£142) for early birds ranging to $888 (£531) for a completely customised version.

At the time of writing the campaign has raised $125,000 (£74,707) of its $200,000 (£119,531) target with 13 days left and delivery of the gadget is expected in September.

Full of features: Users will be able to scroll through social media feeds, while a full web browser will let them access the internet without restrictions. The cuff will also have GPS, and accelerometer and gyroscope on board so it can support lots of fitness apps. A list of features is pictured
