Wayne Rooney is ready to hand in a written transfer request after repeating to Manchester United his wish to quit.

The England forward was on Tuesday night understood to be ‘angry and confused’ over comments by new manager David Moyes that he will not be sold because he provides important back-up forfirst-choice striker Robin van Persie.

Rooney is also furious over the stance taken by new United chief executive Ed Woodward, who insisted no contract talks will take place this summer with the club preferring to monitor Rooney’s progress over the coming season.

Strike a pose: Rooney feels he has nothing to prove after nine seasons at Old Trafford

The 27-year-old feels he is at the peak of his career and has nothing to prove after nine seasons at Old Trafford.

Since returning from United’s tour of the Far East and Australia for 
treatment on a hamstring injury last week, Rooney has made his feelings 
known to the club.

He has re-iterated his desire to leave — having issued a similar message
to Sir Alex Ferguson last season — and is now prepared to put in a 
formal transfer request.

Rooney wants to go this summer with the World Cup less than a year away,
and sources close to the player say he has no intention of allowing his
career to go backwards by being a squad member or playing second fiddle
to Van Persie.

Moyes faces a dilemma now the player has raised the stakes but there 
seems little chance of him staying. Rooney would prefer to join Chelsea,
although Arsenal have enquired about taking him to the Emirates.

If United decide to let him leave, they would prefer not to sell to a 
domestic rival. They have already discussed the possible scenarios and 
believe that out of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, the
French champions would be their preferred buyer.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho added more fuel to his interest in Rooney on Tuesday by warning that England’s World Cup hopes could suffer if he 
stays at United. Chelsea appear to have settled on Rooney as their main 
target after losing out on Radamel Falcao to Monaco and Edinson Cavani 
to PSG.

Mourinho said: ‘If Wayne is a second choice for Manchester United, then 
the national team will be affected.’

Despite the uproar over Rooney, 
United are confident of landing Cesc Fabregas by the start of the new 
season and are prepared to break their transfer record to sign him.

Disillusioned: Cesc Fabregas could be on his way to Manchester United

United have bid £26million for the Spain midfielder and have high hopes Barcelona will sell.

They believe the 26-year-old would choose them ahead of Arsenal — even 
though his old club have first refusal on him — and are prepared to go 
beyond the £30.8m they paid for Dimitar Berbatov in 2008.

Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova on Tuesday said Fabregas wanted to stay, 
but United would not be pursuing the player if they did not have at 
least an inkling that he could be persuaded to leave the Nou Camp.

They feel Fabregas’ nose has been put out of joint by the signing of the Brazilian Neymar.

Vilanova said: ‘I’m aware there have been offers. I had a 
conversation with him and he told me he wanted to continue here.’

Spanish international colleague David de Gea on Tuesday night expressed hope that Fabregas would join him at United.

He said: ‘It would be great if Cesc Fabregas came here. He is a great 
player, very skilful, knows how to win things and you always want those 
type of players in your team.’
