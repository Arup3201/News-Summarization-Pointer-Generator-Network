Michael Gove today condemned thousands of teachers who have taken to the streets during a strike in protest at changes to pay and pensions.

The Education Secretary accused 'militant teaching unions' of putting their own ideology before the interests of the children in their care. 'They are the people who are the enemies of promise,' he said.

The one-day walk-out by members of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and the NASUWT affected schools in 49 local authorities in the East Midlands, East of England, West Midlands, and Yorkshire and Humberside.

Rallies in Birmingham, Sheffield and 
Cambridge attracted the support of teachers from across the strike-hit 
areas, with many carrying banners calling for Mr Gove to be removed from
his post.

Speaking at the Tory party conference in Manchester, Mr Gove said: 'While we gather here today the leaders of the militant teaching unions have called a strike.

'And the reason they have gone out on strike - in a new example of the twisted militant logic - is they want to stop good teachers being paid more money.'

He said he recently challenged a union leader over the strike plans, and was told he should not worry because they were planning 'child-friendly industrial action'.

But Mr Gove hit back: 'There is nothing child-friendly about industrial action.'

Children lose a day of learning while parents are forced to pay for expensive childcare, he said.

'I have a simple message for the leaders of miltant teaching unions: please, please, please don't put your ideology before our children's interests.'

Dismay: The vice-president on the NUT, Max Hyde, said teachers were angry about numerous aspects of the Government's education policy

Max Hyde, vice-president of the NUT, Max Hyde, said teachers were angry about 
numerous aspects of the Government's education policy.

Acknowledging
that many of those at the rally were angry at what they feel is Mr 
Gove's personal ‘disregard’ for their profession, Ms Hyde said: ‘This 
strike is about our concerns about what Mr Gove is doing to education, 
about teachers' working conditions, about his mission to deregulate pay,
and also to restore our pensions.

‘Teachers are very angry at the moment.

‘We have taken a very, very difficult step to come out on strike because Mr Gove is not listening to us.’

Teachers
had exhausted every other avenue prior to taking strike action, Ms Hyde
claimed, adding: ‘I know it's very, very disruptive for parents but we 
want parents to get angry with the man who's causing this - and that's 
Mr Gove.

‘It's very difficult to take action when it affects people that you are close to.

‘In
general the public have a high regard for teachers and if we explain 
why we are taking this action then I'm sure they will understand and 
they will join us in saying 'enough is enough - we want a better future 
for our children'.

‘We want 
teachers to have fair pay for what they do, and a good education system 
for all our children, not just some of our children.’

Widespread action: Members of NUT and NASUWT march through Cambridge

As
well as pay and pension reforms, many teachers voiced concerns at the 
decision to permit schools to employ non-qualified teaching staff and 
introduce performance-related pay.

NUT
member Simon Debenham, who teaches at Birmingham's Heath Mount Primary 
School, said: ‘The teaching profession is being massively attacked and 
undermined by an education secretary who doesn't listen to the 
profession, a man who has a very blinkered vision based on his own 
education.

‘He is trying to impose his vision on children without consultation and without listening to genuine concerns.’

The industrial action was condemned by the Government, which defended its plans to reform pay structures.

A
DfE spokeswoman said: ‘It is disappointing that the NUT and NASUWT are 
striking over the Government's measures to allow heads to pay good 
teachers more.’

A recent 
poll found that 61% of those questioned backed linking teachers' pay to 
performance - a key Government reform currently being introduced - she 
insisted, adding that the survey also found that majority of respondents
were opposed to the walkouts or thought teachers should not be allowed 
to strike.

‘All strikes will
do is disrupt parents' lives, hold back children's education and damage
the reputation of the profession,’ the spokeswoman said.

The
first regional walkout took place in the North West on June 27, and 
further strikes are expected to take place on October 17 in the North 
East, South East, South West and London.

Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.
