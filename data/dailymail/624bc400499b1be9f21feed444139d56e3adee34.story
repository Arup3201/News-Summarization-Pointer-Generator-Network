He had been bitten at least eight times before, having spent the last 21 years handling poisonous snakes and fire in the name of God.

But Pentecostal Pastor Jamie Coots died from his dangerous denomination at the weekend, having been bitten by a rattlesnake at his small Kentucky church and refusing to seek medical attention.

The father-of-two was known for practicing an extreme and rare Christian tradition of snake handling, based on an interpretation of the King James Bible, Mark 16: 17-18, which reads: 'And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.'

Coots starred on the National Geographic show Snake Salvation, which profiled the few serpent-handling preachers in Appalachia,
 and had appeared on numerous documentaries and shows about the snake 
practices at his church in the rural town of Middlesboro, which are 
illegal.

Coots comes from four generations of religious snake handlers and believed they couldn't hurt him as long as he had the power of God.

According to WYKT, emergency crews responded to reports of a snakebite victim at Coots church, Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name, about 8.30pm Saturday.

A rattlesnake had bitten Coots on his right hand but he had gone home before emergency workers arrived.

Officials then went to his house and urged Coots to accept medical care, but he refused.

They left at 9.10pm.

Police then received a call indicating that Coots had died.

He was found dead in his home about 10pm.

In 1995, a woman died at Coots' church from a snake bite.

Melinda Brown, 28, of Parrotsville, Tennessee, was bitten on the arm by a large rattlesnake, Kentucky.com reported.

Following her death, police considered charging Coots with violating Kentucky's law against handling snakes in church, however a judge said Coots should not be prosecuted for practicing his faith.

Brown's husband, John Wayne Brown, 34, later died after being bitten by a rattlesnake in church in Alabama.

One year ago Coots pleaded guilty to violating Tennessee's exotic animals laws after he was found with several rattlesnakes and copperheads in his car.

It is understood he would drive to Tennessee to 'hunt' for the animals himself.

During an interview with Australian current affairs program Sunday Night in July 2013, Coots said he first handled a snake at the age of 20.

Followers have to wait until God instructs them to pick up a snake.

'A peace and a calm came over me and yet an overwhelming joy that God had counted me worthy to let me do that,' he recalled.

His wife, Linda, and two children, daughter Trina and son Cody, are carrying on the family tradition.

'To see Trina or Cody take up a serpent, I know I have done my job as far as training them up in what we believe,' he said.

However Coots had strong beliefs over how he would deal with getting bitten.

At the time he told Sunday Night he had been attacked eight times before.

'I made a vow to god when I first started taking up serpents that if ever I was bitten I wouldn't go to hospital,' he said.

'I believe that when its my time to go there aint a doctor in this world that can keep me here.'

In 1998 a rattlesnake he was handling struck the middle finger of his right hand.

In one of his final interviews, with Australian current affairs program Sunday Night, Jamie Coots explained why he refuses to be treated for snakebites

Coots refused medical attention.

The end of his finger eventually died and fell off.

Snake handling does not take place at every service in the fundamental churches.

Members say that too much emphasis is placed on the snakes by outside people and that they are just regular people practicing religion.
