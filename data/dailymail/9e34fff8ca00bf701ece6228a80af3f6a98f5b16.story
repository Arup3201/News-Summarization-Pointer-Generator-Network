Two brothers were among the four workers that were killed during a hazardous chemical leak at a Texas industrial plant.

Robert and Gilbert Tisnado reportedly worked side by side at the plant with both tragically perishing after Gilbert tried to save his younger brother's life with a gas mask.

Friends and neighbors spoke of the brothers' popularity and kindness.

Albert Davis told Kvue.com: 'Robert lived for his family. I don't know anybody who spent as much time with his family.' 

Robert had three children and Gilbert was a grandfather, the news site said.

One person was injured during the leak.

The chemical, methyl mercaptan, began leaking around 4am on Saturday morning in a unit at the DuPont plant in La Porte, about 20 miles east of Houston. Plant officials said the release was contained by 6am.

Several employees had responded to the leak when they were exposed to the chemical, plant manager Randall Clements said in a statement.

Shocking: Four workers have been killed and one injured following the leak of a hazardous chemical at a DuPont plant in La Porte, 20 miles east of Houston, Texas

Spread: Several employees had responded to the leak when they were exposed to the chemical. It could be smelt 40 miles away, but officials insist it was not a danger to the public 

'There are no words to fully express the loss we feel or the concern and sympathy we extend to the families of the employees and their co-workers,' Clements said. 'We are in close touch with them and providing them every measure of support and assistance at this time.'

The injured person's condition was not immediately known.According to ABC 13, one of them had been working at the plant for 40 years. 

Methyl mercaptan was used at the plant to create crop-protection products such as insecticides and fungicides, according to DuPont. The cause of the leak was not immediately known.

Clements said DuPont would be cooperating with local, state and federal officials investigating the leak.

'As part of that investigation, we are conducting our own top-to-bottom review of this incident and we will share what we learn with the relevant authorities,' he said.

Identities: The names of the other victims have not yet been released, although reports suggested one of the casualties had been working at the plant for around 40 years. The sign outside reads: 'Safety is a core value'

Jeff Suggs, emergency management coordinator for La Porte, said the chemical release was not toxic for those living nearby, but that it caused a smell that's similar to rotten eggs.

'It's a nuisance smell in the area. It's a smell that's traveled quite far,' Suggs said.

Methyl mercaptan is also commonly used to odorize natural gas — which has no odor — for safety purposes.

The La Porte plant has 320 DuPont employees. Four other companies are also tenants at the complex.
