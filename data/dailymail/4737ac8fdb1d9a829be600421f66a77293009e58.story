The meteor fireball that crashed into Russia in February was part of a 656-foot wide asteroid called 2011 EO40.

Spanish astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor that were scattered across the Russian town of Chelyabinsk, where the meteor landed, and claim it came from the large Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses passed Earth as it orbits the sun.

They added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused by the gravitaional pull of the planets and the sun, or could have been caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit.

The meteor fireball, pictured, that crashed into Russia in February was part of a 656-feet wide asteroid called 2011 EO40. Spanish astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and claim it came from the Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses passed Earth as it orbits the sun

Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes and measured 55 feet in diameter 

This caused the fragment to separate off and plummet towards Earth.

The meteor fireball, also known as a superbolide, was seen over Chelyabinsk in the south of the country near the border of Kazakhstan and around 900 miles east of Moscow.

It exploded over Russia's Ural Mountains and is the biggest space rock to have hit 
earth in more than a century.

The 10,000 tonne rock, measuring 
around 55 feet in diameter, created a huge hole in a frozen lake when it
crashed into the ground.

Over 1,000 people were injured by the exploding rock and scientists managed to recover more than 50 tiny fragments of the meteor, allowing them to study its contents and origin.

Nasa scientists at the time said the shockwave caused by the crash was greater than 30 Hiroshima nuclear bombs and was so powerful it travelled twice around the world.

The Russian meteor hit the Earth just hours before an asteroid called 2012 DA14 was spotted nearby but the two incidents were not found to be related.

Viktor Grokhovsky, who led the expedition from Urals Federal University in February following the crash, said that 53 fragments of the meteor have been plucked from the ice-covered Chebarkul Lake

In February divers searched the waters beneath the ice for traces of space rock but surfaced empty handed, leaving some experts questioning whether the hole was indeed formed by a piece of falling debris

Professor Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and his brother Raul from the University of Madrid identified 20 possible sources from a cluster of asteroids dubbed Chelyabinsk asteroid family.

They
told The Telegraph: 'The most probable parent body for the Chelyabinsk 
superbolide is 2011 EO40. Under such conditions, the cluster cannot be 
older than about 20,000–40,000 years.'

However, the only way to confirm this theory, claims Marcos, would be to go into space and take samples of the 2011 EO40 asteroid.

German
scientists are also set to publish finding later this year that claim 
the meteor was made of a stony material called chondrite breccias.Most asteroids are made up of boulders, dust and ice.

Professor
Carlos de la Fuente Marcos added that another similar incident is 
'unlikely' but smaller fragments might crash to Earth as the asteroid 
continues its orbit.

The meteor caused widespread property damage in Chelyabinsk city, with health officials saying that 46 of the injured remain 
hospitalised.

The debris narrowly missed a direct 
and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of 
1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit 
up with a blinding flash.

Service pieces of a meteorite are displayed in a laboratory in Yekaterinburg after being recovered from near Lake Cherbarkul in the Chelyabinsk region. A total of 53 pieces have been brought for analysis to the university in Yekaterinburg

Paul Chodas of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office said at the time: 'We would expect an event of this magnitude to occur once every 100 years.'

He told the Wall Street Journal:
'When you have a fireball of this size we would expect a large number 
of meteorites to reach the surface and in this case there were probably 
some large ones.'

Viktor Grokhovsky, who led the 
expedition from Urals Federal University, said that 53 fragments of the 
meteor had been plucked from the ice-covered Chebarkul Lake.

The local governor estimated the 
damage at 1 billion rubles (£21.5million) and said he hopes the federal 
government will provide at least half that amount.

Lidiya Rykhlova, head of the 
astronomy department at the Moscow-based Institute for Space Research, 
said experts have drafted a program that envisages building powerful 
telescopes, including space-based ones, to warn against potentially 
dangerous asteroids, comets and other threats.

As it raced through the sky, the 
50-foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it, 
creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball 
somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am 
local time on 19 February.

Although
some debris fell to earth, ‘whipping up a pillar of ice, water and 
steam’ and creating a 20-foot-wide crater, the damage in nearby towns 
was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding.

Collectors
from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece of the meteor. Film 
director Steven Spielberg is a noted collector. In October a 9in piece 
of the Seymchan meteorite found in Siberia in 1960 sold in New York for 
$43,750 (£28,200).

Astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit UK cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day. 

The city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact

Local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk regions
