Brian Bubear, 70, was beaten by a recovering alcoholic. He escaped by hiding in a toilet while it took three security staff to restrain his attacker

Crisis-hit Colchester Hospital has issued a grovelling apology after a terminally ill pensioner was beaten with his walking stick by a fellow patient.

Brian Bubear, 70, was sleeping in a private room off the main ward when another patient, an alcoholic who had been brought in to 'detoxify', crept in and attacked him

Mr Bubear only escaped by locking himself in a small toilet attached to the room, while it took three security staff to restrain the attacker.

Worse still, Mr Bubear's 75-year-old wife, Elizabeth, said staff did not tell about the incident for four days afterwards. 

Last month Colchester Hospital was put into special measures by the Care Quality Commission after staff were bullied into changing cancer patients' records to hide missed targets.

Mr Bubear was attacked in the early hours of November 23, just a week after inspectors visited the hospital, as he slept in his room.

His attacker, who has not been named, crept into his room as he slept, took his walking stick from the windowsill where it was resting, and began attacking Mr Bubear with it.

After the attack Mr Bubear, who was suffering from a bad infection at the time, was moved on to a general ward.

His wife said: 'My husband is terminally ill and he is all I have left and to have this happen to him when his is in hospital is completely disgraceful.

'He was in hospital because he needed to be cared for and looked after. Patients should feel safe in a hospital.

'I know he is terminally ill but he will not be going back to that hospital. Never.'

Mrs Bubear, who is recovering from a broken hip which is unconnected to the attack, says she has now taken her husband home, where he is recovering with her.

The attack happened at Colchester Hospital just a week after it was put into special measures after a surprise inspection. The hospital today issued a grovelling apology to Mr Bubear and his wife, Elizabeth

She added: 'I am ashamed of the hospital. It is getting a bad enough name but now I don't even think it is safe.

'I'm not telling the story for me or my husband. I want the public to know what can go on there.

'My husband is so frail and he could even have been killed.'

A state of emergency was declared at Colchester Hospital on November 15 after a surprise visit by health inspectors.

They found patients were inappropriately restrained, sedated without consent, and do not resuscitate signs were being ignored.

The A&E unit was found to be struggling with demand, while it was claimed that staff had tampered with cancer patients' records in order to meet waiting targets.

A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We apologise unreservedly to Mr Bubear and his wife for what happened to him while he was in our care on Langham ward, which is totally unacceptable.

'Unfortunately, this incident could not have been foreseen.

'The patient who hit him was not known to have any mental health issues and had been admitted to the ward shortly before the incident because he was a detoxifying alcoholic with medical needs and did not have any record of carrying out violent acts.

'We have occasionally experienced patients who are detoxifying alcoholics committing criminal damage on the ward, such as smashing a window or pulling equipment off a wall but not attacking other patients. 

'As soon as this incident occurred, the Trust's own security staff were called and a member of the security team remained with the patient who hit Mr Bubear until the ward sister carried out an assessment and decided that one-on-one security was no longer necessary.

'Again, we apologise unreservedly to Mr and Mrs Bubear for this appalling experience.'
