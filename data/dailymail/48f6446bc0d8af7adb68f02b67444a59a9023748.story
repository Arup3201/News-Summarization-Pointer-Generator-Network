Web investor Tim Draper has a grand vision to divide California into six new states, freeing Silicon Valley from the rest of the Golden State.

The plan, which would need government approval, is to split the state into six smaller ones: Jefferson, North California, Central California, West California, South California, and Silicon Valley.

Each new state would have its own government and elected officials, meaning the enclave of Silicon Valley would be free to achieve its techno utopia dreams.

Golden age: Tim Draper wants to divide California into six smaller states

As outrageous as it sounds, the plan has backing from Chuck Reed, the mayor of Silicon Valley's largest city - San Jose.

The venture capitalist told NBC Bay Area: 'It's absolutely appealing to cut ourselves off from the drag of the rest of California.'

While the idea may appeal to many of California's 38 million residents, if the six-state plan were approved it would come down to government and not voters.

'Getting such a measure on California's 
wacky ballot will be no easy task ... attempts to get initiatives on 
the state ballot can cost millions of dollars, and often fail,' Gawker reported TechCrunch as saying.

His plan was met with a mixed reaction on Twitter, with Nuzzel founder Jonathan Abrams tweeting: 'Tim Draper has idea even sillier than moon colony or seasteading.'

Josh Elman, who has worked at various web companies such as Twitter and Facebook, tweeted that the plan reminded him of Ecotopia, a novel set in an ecologically sound future. And Bram Cohen of BitTorrent tweeted: 'Is Tim Draper just engaging in performance art or is he just delusional?'

Co-founder of CentUp Len Kendall imagined what the resulting 'utopia' would look like, tweeting: 'AND THEN teenagers from the various territories will fight to the death in a closed arena to win health benefits.'

The proposal has a long way to go, although raising the funds for such a campaign would not be problematic for Mr Draper, who just stepped down from his billionaire partnership at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, which backed more than 500 start ups including Hotmail, Skype and Telsa electric sports cars.

Dividing lines: If the plan wins approval, Silicon Valley will become a separate state

In an email to TechCrunch he said the reason for dividing the state up was so its large population had more appropriate representation in Washington.

He added that this would mean decisions being made by government would be more relevant to the population.

''This initiative encourages more competition and less monopolistic power,' he said. 'Like all competitive systems, costs will be lower and service will be better.'

The man behind other ground-breaking initiatives such as Draper University in San Mateo, added: 'Each new state can start fresh. From a new crowd-sourced state flower to a more relevant constitution.'

Mr Draper added that Californias had been backing the idea of a divide since 1859, when 'Voters overwhelmingly approved the splitting of California into two states ... but Congress never acted on that request.'
