While many may see the glass as half-empty, photographer Ernie Button sees it as a thing of beauty - especially when itâ€™s stained by whisky.

The Phoenix, Arizona-based artist says he was putting some dishes away one night when he noticed that some of the residue on the bottom of a glass had left a peculiar design.

Mr Button realized that when single-malt whiskey dries, various patterns can be created, and his collection, 'Vanishing Spirits - The Dried Remains of Single Malt Scotch,' was born.

Water on mars? Ernie Button used various types of single-malt whisky to create these amazing images that look like planetary landscapes

Landscape: The dried whisky gives the appearance of clouds or rivers on a planetary surface

Designs: Mr Button uses lights of various colors to create memorizing images

Bottom of the glass: Some may just relegate such a glass to the dishwasher, but Mr Button saw something else entirely

Watery: The effect can be used to give the appearance of a sandy landscape, or the depths of an ocean

Each of the images have their own unique design, and give the viewer the impression that they are looking at an image from the Hubble Telescope or on the surface of a planet like Mars.

Using various colored lights, he was able to create different scenes, making images that appeared to show various interstellar landscapes.

Some may just relegate such a glass to the dishwasher, but Mr Button saw something else entirely.

Cosmic: The images look like something the Hubble Telescope would take far off into space

View from the bottom: Mr Buttons discovered the images created by dried whisky by accident as he was putting a glass into the dishwasher

Cloudy: This image gives the illusion of a cosmic vortex

The mesmerizing images can all be seen in Mr Button's collection 'Vanishing Spirits - The Dried Remains of Single-Malt Scotch

He says on his website: 'Some of the 
images reference the celestial, as if the image was taken of space; 
something that the Hubble telescope may have taken or an image taken 
from space looking down on Earth.

'The circular image references a drinking glass, typically circular, and what the consumer might see if they were to look at the bottom of the glass after the scotch has dried.'

Cool blue: The remnants of the whiskey provide a granular surface that can be manipulated with the help of lights

Down the spiral: Mr Button used light and some dried scotch to create the effect of a circular pattern at the bottom of the glass

Mr Button is also the inventor of cerealism - arranging common breakfast foods to resemble architectural structures and scenes.

One design involved hundreds of Cheerios glued together to form what looked like the pyramids of Egypt.

As
Mr Button says on his website: My images often provide a voice to 
objects that are ignored and frequently overlooked or taken for granted.

Through the looking glass: Mr Button created the captivating designs using a method he discovered by accident

Golden: Different colors of light are used to create unique designs

Red planet: The designs give the impression that they were images of Mars or another planet
