There canâ€™t be many parents around the world who would allow their babies to take part in such an event - but some are clearly willing to take the risk.

A man representing the devil, called El Colacho, today jumped over the one-year-olds in the village of Castrillo de Murcia, near Burgos in northern Spain, in an annual festival dating back to 1621.

The Colacho represents the devil who takes away the evil from the babies as he jumps over them in the medieval religious custom that takes place to celebrate the Catholic feast of Corpus Christi.

Over the centuries there have been no reports of injuries among the babies, but the festival is still considered to be one of the riskiest in the world.

The previous pope, Benedict XVI, had asked Spanish priests to distance themselves from the event.

The exact origins of the ritual are unclear, but Spanish Catholics celebrate the festival throughout the country with colourful processions of dancers dressed as demons and angels.

Castrillo de Murcia has a population of only 500 but is well-known in Spain thanks to the festival.
