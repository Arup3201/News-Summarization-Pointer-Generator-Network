Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers laid down the law to his players during Friday's training session ahead of his side's Premier League encounter against Arsenal.

The Reds go into their home match against the Gunners on the back of a comfortable 3-1 Capital One Cup win against Bournemouth.

However, Rodgers will not be resting on his laurels after the midweek victory as the Liverpool boss will be keen for his side to get back to winning ways in the Premier League.

Liverpool fell to a 3-0 defeat at rivals Manchester United last weekend and the Northern Irishman knows a win against Arsenal could go a long way to lifting the pressure.

Rodgers heaped praise on Raheem Sterling ahead of his side's match on Sunday. The England forward enjoyed one of his finest games in a Liverpool shirt when Arsenal fell to a humiliating 5-1 defeat at Anfield.

‘Raheem is an outstanding talent,' Rodgers said. 'It is incredible the stick that the kid has received. He has been outstanding for us, wherever he has played. (On Sunday) we will do what is in the best interests of the team.’

When asked about Mario Balotelli’s one-game ban from the FA, Rodgers said: ‘We accept the ban so it is fairly clear. He is here as a footballer player and is trying to become a better player.’

Rodgers also said he was disappointed at losing out on 'brilliant' Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez but was keen to stress he was focused on helping his players prepare for the showdown with the Gunners.  

‘He is a world-class player,’ Rodgers said.

‘He was identified as somebody who could come here and be perfect for us. He is a brilliant footballer with outstanding quality and a great work-rate. Arsenal are a top side with top players, but the focus will be on ourselves.’
