A 17-year-old Oklahoma girl was accidentally killed when a gang member mistook her for a rival in a tragic incident that happened just one day after she graduated high school, cops claim.

Kayla Ferrante was sitting in her boyfriend's car the night of May 26, 2012 when Edwin Jermaine Daniels, now 26, opened fired on the vehicle.

Two years later, Daniels is finally facing a trial, as the circumstances of Ferrante's death have been revealed as a likely case of misidentification.

Tragic: Ferrante had graduated from high school just one day before the deadly incident

Just the day before her death, Ferrante graduated a year early from Tulsa's Memorial High School and she dreamed of continuing her studies to become a special education teacher.

The next afternoon, her grandmother held a graduation party in her honor and after that she drove over to a friend's house to watch TV.

Her father Paul Ferrante last saw her leaving the party, when the two hugged and said they loved each other.

That evening, her boyfriend Neikko Perez was driving her home to make her midnight curfew when she was shot.

The couple were nearly home, so Ferrante's mother heard the shots ring out in the street and immediately checked to see if her daughter was involved.

'I ran to her. She was slumped in the seat. I could see her bleeding. I put my hand over her to stop the bleeding. I begged her to stay with me. I told her I loved her,' mom Roxanne Thornton told News on 6.

Initially Daniels got away, but he was arrested a few months later and authorities recovered the murder weapon buried in his aunt's backyard.

He has since been sentenced to 307 years in prison for a separate case including convictions on first-degree burglary, robbery with a firearm, attempted robbery, kidnapping and assault while wearing a mask.

Before Daniels was arrested, community members raised $10,000 as a reward to capture Ferrante's killer. Since Daniels was arrested without the aide of a crime stoppers tip, the reward money now funds a charity called Kayla's Kids which benefits special needs children.

Daniels trial began Monday. He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of shooting with intent to kill.
