A best-selling author fears the manuscript of her new novel has been reduced to ashes by a mystery fire that ripped through her £2.5million townhouse.

Daisy Goodwin wept last night as she told how the book was on a laptop computer that had been consumed by flames.

She, her husband and their two daughters, Lydia, 14, and Ottilie, 23, were not at their home when the fire broke out on the first floor.

But their cleaner was in the basement and managed to flee – only to bravely return to rescue the family’s three dogs.

A baby and two women in a neighbouring property also escaped after the flames spread to their building via the attic. They were treated for smoke inhalation by paramedics.

Sixty fire officers took two and a half hours to extinguish the blaze in West Kensington, London, on Monday.

Last night Mrs Goodwin, who penned the historical novels The Fortune Hunter and My Last Duchess, said: ‘It’s awful. I still can’t believe it.’ 

Earlier she posted on Twitter: ‘So my house has actually burnt down, or half of it. Feel like I am in the Old Testament.

‘I am grateful to the fire brigade for coming so quickly, and to everyone who helped, and I’m glad everyone was alright.’ 

She was at her local library when her husband, TV executive Marcus Wilford, 54, phoned to tell her about the fire. Neighbours had dialled 999 after seeing smoke pouring from the roof.

Mrs Goodwin said: ‘I think the dogs will be fine. I’m worried about my younger daughter’s homework. Her GCSE coursework’s been destroyed.’

She added: ‘I think the novel is backed up somewhere in the Cloud but I just don’t know.’

The family are now in a hotel. London Fire Brigade believe the fire was accidental.
