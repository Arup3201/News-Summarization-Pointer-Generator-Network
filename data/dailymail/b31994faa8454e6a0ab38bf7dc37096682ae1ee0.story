A female teacher at a Wisconsin high school has been sentenced to four years behind bars after having sexual relations with two teenage students.

Megan Garland, 29, entered a no contest plea as the court heard about how she 'groomed' her victims by flirting with them in class with sexualized banter and rewarded them with 'gifts' of snacks and rides in her car.

'Words cannot express how sorry I am,' Garland said in a statement read aloud in the Milwaukee County Circuit Court on Friday.

Behind bars: Megan Garland, 29, has been sentenced to spend four years behind bars after having sexual relations with two different teenage boys

She was first caught performing a sex act on a 14-year-old male student in May 2013 when passersby saw her car rocking back and forth with steamed up windows in the parking lot of nearby Destinly High School.

Garland and the boy, whose name will not be released due to his age and the nature of the crimes, had no relation to Destiny High School but she had begun teaching science at Messmer High School at the beginning of the fall 2012 school year.

She also had a sexual relationship with a different 15-year-old student and she faced separate charges for groping that boy. She also allegedly forced him to touch her in a sexual manner.

Assistant District Attorney Erin Karshen 
said in court that Garland would test the boys by telling them secrets 
in an effort to build trust.

Horrific: Garland, pictured here during class, had sexualized banter with her victims in class and would 'test' them by telling them secrets like when one of them saw her cutting herself while at school

The Journal Sentinel reports that the 14-year-old boy once saw Garland cutting herself inside Messmer High School and they made an agreement for him not to tell anyone.

Treatment: Garland has had depression and anxiety issues for years and is now receiving medication

Garland's attorney and her father both told the court that she has had depression and anxiety issues for many years.

Since her arrest last year, she has been seeking treatment which includes the use of medication.

She said that she plans to continue to 'work on my issues'.

'All I can do is offer my sincerest apology,' she said in court.

The mother of the older victim said that her son now struggles with his view of sex and trust in women after Garland 'meticulously planned' their trysts to 'indulge her sick fantasy'.

That mother also read a statement from the other victim's mother who said that Garland, who made up lies about the boys to the basketball coach to get them suspended from the team, has ruined his chances of becoming a basketball star.

'You saw his potential and tried to kill it,' the woman wrote in the statement.

Garland's attorney initially pushed for her sentence to be one year behind bars with probation, using her 'searingly candid' interview with police as a point to her credit.

That did not convince the judge, as she now faces four years behind bars.

Garland was suspended from her teaching at Messmer High School, where she has worked since last July
