'We would never copy the British': French PM Jean-Marc Ayrault has criticised the UK's economic policy which he says has caused 'mass poverty'

The Prime Minister of France has launched a blistering attack on British economic policy – saying it is responsible for 'mass poverty'.

Jean-Marc Ayrault painted a picture of a United Kingdom racked by extremes of wealth and poverty and said his own country would ‘never copy’ it - yet did not acknowledge that his country's own economy was in crisis.

Asked about austerity cuts imposed by British Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government, Mr Ayrault said: 'France is about to regain the level of national wealth it had before the 2008 crisis, and Britain has still not got there.

'So the situation in Britain, with the mass poverty that it generated is far worse than in France.’

His remarks came as credit agency Standard & Poor's cut its long-term rating of the European Union by one notch to AA+ today, saying it had concerns about how the bloc's budget was financed.

The 63-year-old Socialist told TV channel TF1 last night: ‘I see a lot more poverty, more inequalities, and if I was to look for a model to reform France I would want to save the French model.’

He said that he would ‘reform’ France but ‘certainly not copy what others do, especially not if we're not talking about the best.’

Mr Ayrault was particularly critical of Britain's zero-hour contracts under which employees agree to be available for work as and when required.

‘Do you find this okay?’ he asked. ‘Do you think the French would accept this? This is not our policy.’

Mr Ayrault’s left-wing party is associated with turning France in one of the cushiest places for workers anywhere in the world.

It brought in the 35-hour week and – since Mr Ayrault was appointed Prime Minister last year by President Francois Hollande – there have been a raft of other massively expensive measures.

These have included a reduction in the retirement age from 62 to 60 for some categories of workers, a rise in the minimum wage and the introduction of a 36-month rent freeze on new contracts.

But, despite all this, the French economy is in crisis, and polls regularly show that Mr Hollande is the most unpopular president in the history of the country.

There has been particular criticism of proposed top tax rate of 75 per cent, and Mr Hollande’s admission that he ‘dislikes the rich’.

Mr Ayrault has just announced a controversial budget approving more tax rises and cuts in public spending in a bid to rein in the high public deficit.

British Chancellor George Osborne produced an autumn statement forecasting economic growth of 2.4 per cent in 2014, with many commentators suggesting that recovery is well underway.

Meanwhile, the downgrade of the European economy by S&P was dismissed by EU leaders and other officials as misguided.

In a statement that 
came 11 months after it announced it had a 'negative' outlook on the 
region, S&P said: 'In our opinion, the overall creditworthiness of the now 28 European
 Union member states has declined.

'EU budgetary negotiations have become more contentious, 
signalling what we consider to be rising risks to the support of the EU 
from some member states.'

European officials said they were not 
surprised by the move since S&P recently downgraded the Netherlands 
and has lowered its view on six other member states - France, Italy, 
Spain, Malta, Slovenia and Cyprus - in the past year.

But they 
pointed out that the EU has no debt or deficit to speak of and its 
budget is a stand-alone entity financed by 28 countries, making it one 
of the most stable institutions and most reliable borrowers in the 
world.

Francois Hollande is the least popular French President in history, according to polls. ‘Another couple of weeks, and we’ll be able to call [our supporters] by their first names!’ a presidential adviser said bitterly the other day, summing up the mood at the presidential Elysée Palace.

The President had just been booed on Remembrance Day. The Prime Minister was ridiculed in parliament by members of his own Socialist party.

Protesters in Brittany — who have taken to wearing red caps like their ancestors resisting the King’s taxes — tore apart new toll gates on highways. Farmers circled Paris with tractors, slowing down access for almost a day.

Truck drivers, poultry breeders, teachers, midwives, craftsmen, even riding instructors and their ponies have taken to the streets to yell at tax rises.

Across the eurozone, there are signs that economic conditions are improving — and yet in France there are daily demonstrations and business failures. Representing only 8 per cent of the workforce, trade unions are unable to channel this anger.

Violent protests burst out and public outrage is stoked by the bonuses granted to CEOs. ‘Ras le bol!’ (Enough is enough!)

France is fuming with rage—and the party that is profiting from the situation is the far-Right Front National.

A year and a half into his mandate, Hollande has run out of steam. Despite the bravura of his foreign policy—Mali, Iran, if not Syria — the French now doubt his leadership abilities and competence of his government.

The rumour is that cabinet members are already looking for other jobs. Politicians and pundits compare scenarios: will the President change his Prime Minister? Will he call elections and risk losing his majority to the conservatives?

Should he resign, as some suggest, even though, short of his committing murder, French institutions protect the President for the duration of his five-year mandate? ‘None of that will happen,’ sighs the Elysée adviser. ‘Don’t underestimate his capacity to stay put in the merde . . .’

An optimist and champion of economic cycle theory, François Hollande staunchly believes the situation can only improve, repeating against all odds that there is no recession, that unemployment will decrease by the end of the year, that public debt will diminish and welfare will be protected.

History and his Socialist predecessor as president, François Mitterrand, have convinced him that the French cannot endure harsh facts, and that the art of politics starts with mincing words. His appeasement strategy has backfired.

The Socialist President was elected on the promise that the rich would pay. Now almost everybody does — since 2009, taxation has risen from 42 per cent to 46 per cent of GDP.

The Prime Minister announced an overhaul of spending, a political coup to save his skin, but people worry that taxes will rise even more.

Hollande has been credited for taking small steps in the right direction — so small that competitiveness measures have not boosted business, job flexibility regulations have not paid off and neither have pension reforms.

The public service system is about to become the largest proportionally in the world, at 57 per cent of GDP. The core of Hollande’s electorate are public servants, who resent not being rewarded more. Their support is dwindling.

Beyond dire economic circumstances, the legalisation of gay marriage, pushed through parliament before the summer, has stirred up French society.

Shaken by globalisation, wary of immigration and deceived by electoral promises, people have reacted strongly.

The opposition UMP party, weakened by internal fighting, has not benefited from government disarray.

Seventy-four per cent believe the conservatives would do no better. A new form of populism is emerging, more individualistic, a blend of anger at the elites, Right and Left, and at the sense of national drift.

The Front National is revelling in all this. It is ahead in the polls for the forthcoming local and European elections.

Her political platform may be inconsistent, her economic programme inept, her anti-immigration stance deceitful, but party leader Marine Le Pen speaks the language of the common man.

The vocabulary of the extreme Right is melting into common parlance, its racial undertones amplified by social media.

Christiane Taubira, the Justice Minister, born in French Guiana, and the eloquent champion of the gay marriage bill, has become the target of foul racial slurs. The political vacuum allows for less inhibited public speech and tactics.

The French have gone through similar periods before, rage simmering without leading to radical change.

The elites should brace themselves for the elections in the spring.
