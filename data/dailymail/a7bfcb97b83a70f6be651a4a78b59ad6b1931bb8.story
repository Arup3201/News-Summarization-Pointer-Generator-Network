These naughty lion cubs found themselves in trouble with their mum after ending up covered in mud.

The mischievous duo and their mum were spotted by professional wildlife photographer Andy Rouse during a visit to the Masai Mara in Kenya.

On the first day the two young cubs were the picture of innocence with wide eyes and fluffy, spotlessly clean coats.

However, when Mr Rouse returned the next day to spend more time with the family the cubs looked very different indeed.

For at some point they had managed to get themselves coated from head to tail in mud.

And when mum caught sight of them there was hell to pay.

Spotting one of her rowdy offspring the mother lion sprang forward to intercept them.

Throwing a tantrum: Like all babies, this cub had a cry when it was told off by its mother

The impish cub appeared to attempt a getaway but soon knew the game was up and that he had been well and truly collared.

Speaking about the encounter Mr Rouse
said: 'I have no idea what they had been into overnight to get so mucky
but clearly it had been fun.

'It was an amazing privilege to watch them play with mum and with each other.

'They were so sweet that I loved 
watching their antics. They pulled each other's tails, jumped all over 
mum and generally created havoc in the name of fun'.

On the second day of his trip to Masai Mara, Mr Rouse noticed the cubs had managed to get themselves very muddy
