A dementia-suffering pensioner was sent home from hospital with a tube still in her arm, barefoot and naked except for an open-backed NHS gown.

Lily Winfield, 77, from Barnsley, was admitted to Barnsley Hospital last Wednesday, after suffering a mini-stroke.

The mother of seven was discharged on Saturday, and was sent home in an ambulance because her daughter, Joy Stafford, with whom she lives, was at work.

But when her mother arrived home Joy - herself a carer - was horrified to find a cannula, which was used for an intravenous drip, was still in her arm.

And despite the winter cold Mrs Winfield, who has vascular dementia and diabetes, was wearing just a hospital gown with her clean and pressed nightclothes still unworn in her suitcase.

Ms Stafford said the blundering hospital staff were forced to send a rapid response team to quickly and safely remove the cannula still in her mother’s arm before it became infected.

The hospital has since apologised to Ms Stafford and Mrs Winfield and has said an investigation has been launched. 

Disgusted: Joy Stafford and her mother, Lily Winfield, 77. Ms Stafford is now launching a complaint about her mother's care.

Ms Stafford said: 'It’s disgusting.

'I’m a carer myself and I always think ‘what if that was me in that bed or chair? How would I want to be treated?’

'You think they are in the best place for them, in the hospital, and this makes me not want to send her there any more.

'She must’ve been freezing. I took her straight upstairs and washed her. I took a photo of the cannula and what she looked like - it was just shocking.'

Now Joy, 43, said she is considering making a formal complaint.

She said: 'It upsets me to think that people get treated like that. I know they are overworked but I don’t know how they can work there and not care.

'I feel because she is a certain age and has dementia, they thought ‘she’s got dementia, she’ll never know.’'

Heather McNair, Barnsley Hospital Chief Nurse, said: 'We are very sorry for Mrs Winfield’s experience and, after speaking with her daughter earlier this week, are already underway with a thorough investigation.

Apology: Barnsley Hospital is already underway with a thorough investigation
