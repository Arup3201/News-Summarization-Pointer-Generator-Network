With just days to go, the battle for the coveted Christmas number one spot is hotting up with One Direction and Lady Gaga slugging it out for the title.

But this is one battle that has nothing to do with music - instead, the pop titans are going to war over perfume sales.

Currently in the lead is the British boyband, whose Our Moment fragrance is currently outselling every other celebrity perfume by five to one.

But Lady Gaga isn't going down without a fight - her 18th century inspired perfume, Fame, is occupying second place and selling well.

Behind the American singer are Britney Spears and Nicky Minaj whose Fantasy and Pink Friday fragrances occupied third and fourth slots in the chart compiled by retailer, feelunique.

Rounding out the top five is Justin Bieber with his third fragrance, The Key, which has yet again proved popular with teens.

Other big names in the top 10 include Taylor Swift with last year's top seller, Wonderstruck, and the ever-popular David Beckham, who despite not having released a perfume for two years, took seventh place with Homme.

Completing the list of top sellers were Beyonce with Heat, Kate Moss with the unimaginatively titled Kate, and Dita von Teese with Eau de Parfum.

Celebrity perfume is now worth a 
staggering £18 billion a year, £225 million in the UK alone, with 20 new efforts released each year.

But
 of all the perfumes launched this year, it is One Direction's effort 
that has spawned the most column inches, although the quintet still have
 some way to go before they outsell the most successful celebrity scent 
of all time, Elizabeth Taylor's 1989 White Diamonds.

Despite
 being described by Femail beauty blogger Elsa McAlonahan as 'very sweet
 and a tad too heavy for daytime for grown-ups', the frangipani-based 
Our Moment acquired a waiting list ahead of its launch - a testament to 
the selling power of the world's most popular boyband.

Speaking about the results, Siobhan McDermott, general manager at feelunique said: 'Celebrity fragrance is a huge seller for us and especially at this time of the year.

'It’s no surprise that in the run up to Christmas, fragrance is flying off the shelves. It just proves that women will quite literally do anything to have Harry Styles’ scent on their skin.'
