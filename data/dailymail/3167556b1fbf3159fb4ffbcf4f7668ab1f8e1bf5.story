Spain has been forced to make an embarrassing apology to the King of Morocco after police officers mistook the royal for a drug smuggler before attempting to board his yacht. 

King Mohammed VI had been enjoying a day sailing in the waters off Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta when a Spanish civil guard patrol boat began speeding towards his entourage.

Officers approached two speed boats and three jetskis belonging to the king's party and demanded to know the identities and destination of those on board.

Incensed: King Mohammed VI of Morocco was furious with Spanish civil guard officers after they mistook his boat for a drug-smuggling vessel in waters off Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta

The incensed monarch is said to have shouted: 'Do you know who I am?', Spanish daily newspaper El Mundo reports.

When the officers said they did not -  he removed his cap and sunglasses and was instantly recognised by the sheepish patrol crew. 

An infuriated King Mohammed then immediately phoned King Felipe VI of Spain to complain about the incident, the Telegraph reports.

An urgent message was sent from the Royal Household to Spain's interior ministry and Colonel Andres Lopez, the head of the Civil Guard in Ceuta, was immediately dispatched to the Moroccan royal yacht so that he could personally apologise.

While King Mohammed recognised that Spanish officers were 'only doing their job' he also stated 'the police did not show me respect'. 

Spain's Royal Palace insisted King Felipe maintains a 'very good relationship with Mohammed VI'.

King Felipe and Queen Letizia visited the Moroccan king last month in one of their first official trips abroad since the abdication of King Juan Carlos. 

The attempt to search the royal yacht on August 7 came days before a huge influx of migrants landed on Spanish shores after crossing the Strait of Gibraltar from the Moroccan coast.

Drug trafficking gangs routinely use speed boats and jetskis to transport illegal substances across the strait.

Despite being part of Spain, Ceuta is an autonomous city located on the coast of North Africa.

It has been a European territory for more than 500 years, and Madrid insists it will not relinquish control of the city.   

The majority of the city's population are ethnic Spanish and opposed to the idea of being ruled by Morocco. 

It is just 12.5 miles from the Spanish coast and has an area of seven square miles.

On 5 November 2007, King Juan Carlos I of Spain visited the city, sparking protests from the Moroccan government. 

It was the first time a Spanish head of state had visited Ceuta in 80 years.
