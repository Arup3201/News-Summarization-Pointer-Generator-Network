A lie detector test trapped nearly 4,000 benefit cheats in just four months.

The offenders were picking up council tax discounts worth £1.4million by falsely claiming they lived alone.

But they were caught out by technology that analyses phone calls for signs of stress in the speaker’s voice.

Lie detector: Southwark council is using voice stress analysis software to catch benefits 
cheats - a move which is credited as catching some 4,000 fraudsters and 
saving more than £1,400,000 in four months

Southwark council in South London used the system to check on 53,000 households claiming the 25 per cent council tax discount.

It found that in approximately one in 13 cases, the discount was being wrongly claimed.

A council spokesman said: ‘We are very
pleased with the results. Between July and November, we have removed 
3,851 people from the list of those claiming the discount.

‘It has resulted in additional bills of £1.4million of council tax which is payable.’

The voice risk analysis system works 
by analysing the pitch of callers’ voices when they are asked questions 
by council officials.

If the system suspects a lie is being 
told, a beep sounds in the operator’s ear. Once alerted, the operator is
trained to begin asking questions that may uncover the truth.

It can lead to a full investigation 
into claims for housing benefit, council tax, income support and 
jobseeker’s allowance. Claimants are warned in advance that the phone 
call is being ‘recorded and monitored for the detection of fraud’.

Anyone who refuses to take part in the
call is likely to be visited in person for an assessment of their 
claim. It is not the first time lie detectors have been used by 
councils.

Lie detectors were trialled by former Work and Pensions Secretary John Hutton four years ago with 24 councils across Britain

Former work and pensions secretary John Hutton ordered a pilot
study four years ago in which 24 local authorities tested the concept.

Two years ago, however, the  Government abandoned the detector tests saying they were unreliable.

An academic study also raised doubts by suggesting the technology was little better than ‘astronomy’ at detecting fraud.

Insurance companies similar systems to catch fraudsters.

A Southwark spokesman said claimants 
who did not speak English as their first language or had hearing or 
cognitive problems were exempt from the voice checks.

Richard Livingstone, the council’s cabinet member for finance and resources, said: ‘We are taking a tough stance against fraud.

‘Any resident found making a false claim will be fully investigated and the necessary action taken.’

A spokesman for Capita – the private 
firm contracted by Southwark to carry out the checks – said it preferred
not to describe it as a lie detector test, insisting it used the voice 
checking system together with ‘behavioural analysis by trained 
operators’.

He insisted: ‘The technology is not used in isolation.’

A spokesman for London Councils said he did not know of any other authorities in the capital using the system.

A similar response was given by a 
spokesman for the Local Government Association, which represents 423 
authorities across Britain.

Harrow Council has used the voice analysis system to check on housing benefit and council tax benefit claims.

A spokesman for the authority said: ‘We did try this technology but stopped using it three years ago.’
