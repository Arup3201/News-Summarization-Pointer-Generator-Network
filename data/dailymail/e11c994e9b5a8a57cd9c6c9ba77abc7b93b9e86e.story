The teams on the fringe of the race for European places next season have been given a boost by the FA Cup semi-final draw.

After Arsenal and Liverpool were kept apart, a final between the two could result in an extra Europa League place being awarded to the Premier League. 

Some clubs might regard a place in UEFA’s second-tier competition as an unwanted prize given the demands of Thursday night football and the potential for it to disrupt weekly plans and often negatively affect performances in the Premier League.

But clubs such as Southampton (currently 7th), Stoke (8th), Swansea (9th) or West Ham (10th) might look upon it as a bonus.

There are three Europa League places up for grabs for English teams, with one spot going to the fifth-placed side in the League and places going to the winners of the FA Cup and Capital One Cup.

With Chelsea winning the latter competition and all but guaranteed a top-four finish, their spot would go to the team who finish sixth.

In the FA Cup, if the winners have already qualified for Europe via the League, their place goes to the runners-up. But with Arsenal and Liverpool likely to finish in the top six, a final between the two would mean the last Europa spot going to the club in seventh.
