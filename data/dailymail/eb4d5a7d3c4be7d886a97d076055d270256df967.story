Goals from winger Harry Wilson and striker Jerome Sinclair secured a 2-0 win for Liverpool U21s over Chelsea on Monday night.  

Sinclair's pace and and determination won a penalty in the first half which Wilson duly converted.   

The forward then added his own name to the score sheet after the restart, cutting in from the left flank and firing home his 22nd goal of the season from a tight angle.

Chelsea had started the brighter of the two sides and should have perhaps taken an early lead through Issiah Brown, but he could not direct an awkwardly bouncing ball into the net.  

That early scare prompted a response from the Reds though and Cameron Brannagan sent Sergi Canos through on goal soon after, although the Spaniard dragged his shot wide.

The deadlock was broken when Sinclair powered his way into the Chelsea box in the eighth minute and was fouled by Fikayo Tomori, with Wilson scoring the ensuring spot kick.   

The second goal followed a similar routine - Sinclair's surging pace duped Tomori again and the young striker, dancing along the byline before whipping in from a seemingly impossible angle, was able to add to his already impressive scoring tally for the season.
