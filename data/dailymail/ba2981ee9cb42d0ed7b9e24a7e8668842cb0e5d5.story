Her mugshot has since gone viral, with hundreds of tweeters commenting on her good looks and offering to pay her $360 bail.

One user wrote: 'If you're not committed to setting Angela Coates free, you're either a loser or your gf [girlfriend] is looking at all of your tweets.'

Another compared Coates's mugshot to a 'beauty pageant entry form', while some even suggested a Kickstarter fundraiser to free the model. 

Despite the numerous offers of help, Coates later revealed she was released from prison the same night, according to Clutch Magazine.

Jet Magazine have confirmed via Twitter that the model was a former winner of its 'Beauty of the Week' contest.

It comes just three months after a mugshot of convicted felon Jeremy Meeks took the internet by storm after being posted on a police Facebook page. 

Users were so enamored by the 30-year-old criminal's blue-eyed, strong-jawed features that they liked the image more than 20,000 times in less than 24 hours.

In June, Meeks' lawyer told MailOnline that his client was in talks with top fashion designers to dress him for his trial.

But reports that he was offered a $30,000 modeling contract were ultimately unfounded, his talent manager said. 

The case of Meeks, who was arrested on a slew of state felony counts June 18 as part of a gang bust in Stockton, California, has now been turned over to federal prosecutors.
