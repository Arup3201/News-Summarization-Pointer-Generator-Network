A wire-tapping lawsuit in San Francisco against Google could cost the internet giant billions of dollars or nothing, depending on the result of a search of two hard company hard drives.

22 plaintiffs accuse the search engine company of vacuuming personal data off their Wi-Fi networks with its roving Street View cars between 2008 and 2010. 

If successful the lawsuit would be a landmark judgement, as online corporations have faced criticism but rarely judgments for their handling of users' privacy.

Snooped: Google is accused of indiscriminately gathering data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks with Street View cars

The Street View cars were deployed with 360-degree camera systems to capture images for Google Street View and Google Earth.

When the Street View cars were announced, Google did not reveal they were also loaded with wireless analyzers, tools designed to 'sample, collect, decode, and analyze' data sent over accessible Wi-Fi networks.

That led to Street View cars vacuuming up huge amounts of 'payload' data, which includes passwords, email and multimedia like videos and photos. 

Even data from Voice Over Internet Protocols, such as the Internet phone service Skype, may have been collected.

Bloomberg reports that the case stalled while Google fought to appeal the wiretapping accusation, claiming that  data on unsecured wireless networks was equivalent to that on AM/FM transmissions.

The Supreme Court declined to hear Google's case in June.

Rogue: Marius Milner added code that turned Street View cars into vacuums of personal data, which Google alleges he did on his own

Even as the lawsuit goes forward, proof will need to be found that personal data was collected by searching two hard drives held as evidence in San Francisco.

Both sides have been ordered to settle on a neutral expert to comb through the hard drives to find traces of data being picked up.

Once over that hurdle, the plaintiffs will have an easier time winning what would be a watershed online privacy lawsuit, as they do not have to prove they suffered damage from Google's actions or that Google initiated the project maliciously.

In the past, Google claimed that the wireless analyzer program was the work of a 'rogue' programmer, which the corporation only found out about after it was initiated. 

The employee, first referred to as 'Engineer Doe,' was later outed as Marius Milner, a respected British expert on wireless networks, according to the New York Times. 

Street View cars throughout the United States, Canada and Europe collected data, triggering various investigations.

In 2013, the search engine company said it would pay $7million to settle with over 30 states and the District of Columbia over its data collection practices. 

The ongoing lawsuit, which has yet to move to the class action phase, would net up to $10,000 in damages for each affected user, leading a windfall judgement.
