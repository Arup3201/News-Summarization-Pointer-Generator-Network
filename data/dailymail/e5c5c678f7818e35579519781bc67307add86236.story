Cambridge United's prime-time date with Manchester United on BBC One has become more than an FA Cup fourth round tie.

It has become a celebration of a club's survival and a display of appreciation for those who joined forces in the city to defy the odds and ensure their club did not wither and die when they were relegated from the Football League in 2005.

There were dark times when it seemed like a tale destined to end in heartbreak but Cambridge pulled through, an inspiration for other small clubs on the slide and a testament to individuals who made it happen.

There are many deserving credit, but they include Jez George, who is now the club's chief executive and has been many other things besides, both in an official and unofficial capacity.

'It's been a really tough period of time for the club,' said George. 'It was very hard for us to survive outside the Football League. The worst time for me was probably February 2011. The team was heading for relegation, there was no money, we had to move on some senior players and the manager was sacked.

'I was asked to take the team on as a caretaker manager until the end of the season. Fortunately, we'd fought really hard to set up a youth team in 2006 and a group of young players came through at the same time.

'Three of them played at Wembley last year – Josh Coulson, Liam Hughes and Luke Berry. They were thrown into the team and rescued the club really.

'We survived with a game to spare, but that was our darkest period. If the club had got relegated at that point it would have gone out of business. That was the lowest point.

Cambridge stayed up and George, having taken over from Martin Ling, continued in charge as the gradual re-building process continued.

He initially joined the club as a youth team coach and made a vital contribution to keeping the club's youth system going during the years with no funding, launching into a series of walks and marathons to raise thousands. For him the long road back was even more arduous.

When Richard Money was appointed as manager in October 2012, George returned to the role of director of football. Last October, he became the chief executive.

'I never wanted to be a manager,' said 44-year-old George. 'But sometimes when it's your club there are a set of circumstances that make it the right thing to do. No-one else was here. The club had no money and were still paying off the contracts of the previous managers.

'We were moving the senior players on and putting younger ones in, so it was only ever going to be me who was going to take responsibility for that.

'I had no real football background. I was a fan as a kid, and had worked as Cambridge City as commercial manager, where I set up a youth team. In 2005 they closed the youth scheme here at United so I was asked to come year a here later to set it up again.

'You have no funding outside the Football League, and no right for compensation if you lose players, no games programme, so to set something up from scratch when every single player had gone is very difficult. But this club was never going to have the finances to buy players so we knew we had to develop our own. And some of those players rescued the club in 2011.

'In the bleakest days the crowds were down to 1,600, and now they're back to 4,500 to 5,000. Getting back into the league has been a real catalyst for the club and the city, as we've all got something back we'd missed so badly.

'When you drop out of the Football League it feels as if you've fallen of the face of the earth. The Conference is a tough league, with good clubs in it. Stockport were relegated and are in Conference North. Hereford got relegated again and went out of business.'

Cambridge, promoted to League Two via the Conference play-offs last year, are very much back in business. Bring on Manchester United.
