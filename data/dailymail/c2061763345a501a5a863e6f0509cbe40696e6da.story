The scandal-hit mayor of Washington DC Vincent Gray has conceded defeat in Tuesday’s election to choose the Democratic candidate to enter the general election in November.

The District of Columbia's Democratic mayoral primary was instead won by Muriel Bowser after an election season defined by a scandal involving Gray's campaign four years ago.

Bowser tapped into an electorate that had grown tired of the allegations surrounding Gray, whose associates have been convicted of involvement in an illegal slush fund that aided his 2010 campaign.

Turnout on Tuesday was low, but close to midnight and with nearly 90 percent of precincts reporting, Bowser led Gray 44 to 33 percent, according to the D.C. Board of Elections.

Gray conceded soon after those results came in.

A little before 11:30 p.m., Bowser had addressed her watch party, asking volunteers - some of whom had been with her since a 5:30 a.m. rally - whether they were ‘tired.’

They replied in the negative.

‘I’m not tired either!’ she said with a grin, adding: ‘Friends, will you wait with me a few more moments?’

Bowser is a D.C. council-member and a protege of former Mayor Adrian Fenty, whom Gray defeated in 2010.

The Democratic primary winner has gone on to win every general election since the district began electing a mayor 40 years ago.

Bowser had relentlessly sought to make the campaign a referendum on Gray’s ethics.

The defining moment of the election season in the nation's capital came when U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen said last month that Gray knew about an illegal, $668,000 ‘shadow campaign’ that helped propel him into office four years ago.

Despite denials from the mayor, who has not been accused of a crime, the revelation further damaged an incumbent whose support had already eroded amid a long-running federal investigation.

The large field, weak incumbent and early April 1 date had made the primary unusual.

In the past, the city has selected a Democratic nominee in September, followed by a two-month victory lap and a mostly ceremonial general election. Three out of four registered voters in the city are Democrats.

Five people involved with Gray's 2010 campaign have pleaded guilty to felonies, but the mayor has denied all wrongdoing.

The most recent was Jeffrey Thompson, a businessman and government contractor who admitted in court three weeks before the primary that he set up the $668,000 slush fund.

The mayor said the crimes committed by others during his campaign did not bleed over into his administration, and he'd asked voters to focus on his accomplishments.

Even some critics concede he's done a good job running the city - which is enjoying a robust economy, surging population and improving schools - and polls show a disconnect between voters' negative perception of Gray and their sunny outlook on the district's progress.

'If you look at an airplane analogy, he's been a good pilot, he's flying the plane well, but there's this fundamental question about whether he deserved to be in the cockpit in the first place,' said Tony Bullock, a federal lobbyist who was the communications director for former Mayor Anthony Williams.

Bowser had said it was impossible to separate Gray's performance in office from questions about how he got there.

Voters 'want their mayor to be able to focus on the issues that affect them,' she said, and 'not on his own legal battles.'
