The father of a three-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself in the head with a loaded 40 caliber Smith and Wesson backed the right to bear arms hours after losing his son on Sunday.

Brian Holbrook, of Michigan, said: 'I have nothing wrong with guns, I will still support the Second Amendment' [sic]

He made his comments on his Faceboook page hours after his son shot himself in the head after finding a loaded gun at his home, which was owned by Joshua Michael Greenhill, 30.

The grieving father added that gun owners should keep their weapons secure and safe.

Police said Damon died after finding a loaded gun in a closet at the family home in Dundee, Michigan.

Gun owner Greenhill, who lived at the house and has a permit, had placed the weapon inside his closet in an unlocked case and was charged today with careless discharge causing injury or death.

He faces up to two years in prison and a fine of $2,000 after being arraigned in Monroe County District Court before Judge Terrence Bronson, The Blade reported.

The 30-year-old, who has no criminal record, told police he placed the case in an unlocked closet after returning from work.

Within five minutes the young boy had found the gun and pulled the trigger. Police said the gun had a bullet in the chamber.

Paramedics tried to revive Damon at the house before he was taken to St Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, where he was pronounced dead in the hospital emergency room at 5 p.m on Sunday.

Mt Holbrook,a plant operator at the University of Michigan, posted a message on his Facebook page expressing his sorrow over the loss of his youngest son.

He wrote:'Yesterday I lost my 3yrd son to a gun accident,' Brian Holbrook wrote on his page.

'We r all hoping to wake up from this nightmare. My baby boy is gone & I will never get to hold him again. I will miss him terribly.' [sic]

While supporting the right for all US citizens to bear arms, he made a plea for gun owners to keep their weapons safe.

He said: 'All I ask is that everyone please, please safety first... lock it up and put it out of reach of anyone that has no business being around a gun especially kids.

'Gun safety people! My boy would still be here if it was put away like it should have been. Thank you for all the prayers & well wishes.'

The young victim lived in the house with four other children, including his five-year-old brother and 10-year-old sister.

Mr Holbrook shares joint custody of the children with his ex-wife who lives elsewhere.

The gun owner, his wife and seven-year-old son were also living in the two storey home.

Police said the gun owner had a permit for the weapon and had no criminal record.

He and the other adults were in the kitchen when they heard a single gunshot.

Damon was alone in the main floor bedroom when he found the gun and started playing with it, said Dundee police spokesman Sgt. Thomas Redmond.
