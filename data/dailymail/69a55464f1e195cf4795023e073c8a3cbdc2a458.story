The shocking moment that a man dressed as Santa with a pellet gun today was caught by a news camera crew as he headed for a toy giveaway in Washington D.C.

The interview with the unidentified Santa was interrupted with pained screams while he was being asked about the Christmas Eve toy drive.

Police later forced him to get checked out at a local hospital where he was discovered to have a pellet lodged in his upper back.

Good deed: This man dressed up as Santa for a toy drive in Southeast DC and was headed to hand out gifts

Change: He quickly turned around in pain and yelped when he was shot in the back

The man himself, predictably, was the first to understand what actually happened as he repeated 'I've been shot! I've been shot!'

The cameraman from local ABC affiliate WJLA asked if he needed to be taken to the emergency room and Santa said that he wanted to keep going to the toy drive.

A crowd gathered and one female passer-by tried to locate the wound in his upper back.

At first glance, it did not look as if the shot had penetrated his bright red coat and he concluded aloud that it must have been a pellet gun.

Hurting: The pain quickly became unbearable but it did not initially appear that there was a visible entry wound

Trying to go on: The Santa said he could keep going to the toy drive but police decided he had to go to hospital where doctors dislodged the pellet gun stuck in his upper back

Â The reporter on the scene said that police concluded that it was in fact a pellet gun but it did so some damage, forcing the well-intentioned Santa to go to the hospital to have the pellet removed.

'Officers on scene believe pellet gun shots came from a 2nd story window. No suspect in pellet shooting of Santa,' which took place in the south East section of D.C.

In a Christmas twist, the toy drive went on with the man assigned to dress like The Grinch stepped in for the ailing Santa.
