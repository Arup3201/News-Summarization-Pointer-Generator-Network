A Banksy artwork has been removed from a wall just hours after it was tracked down to a Bristol street.

The piece, called Mobile Lovers depicting two lovers embracing while checking their mobile phones, with the man looking suspiciously like former prime minister Tony Blair, was initially posted to Banksy's website yesterday but with its whereabouts unknown.

It was then today tracked down to a street in Bristol within sight of the city centre, but within hours it was taken down by members of the Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project with crowbars this afternoon.

But the group insist that rather than just taking the art work, they are actually keeping it safe from harm and are inviting people to the project to view the work.

They then plan to auction off the piece of art as they were told the work was left for them and they hope it could bring in around £100,000.

Leader of the youth club Dennis Stinchcombe said: 'He has given it to the club. He couldn't give it to us directly as the gates were locked so he put it as close as he could. He has done it to help the right people.

'Somebody was saying it is worth £40,000 but I am hoping for £100,000. It has been authenticated on his website but I am going to try to get it officially done as well.

'We will let people come and see it in here for a while then get it to Bonhams for valuation.

'The money will allow us to do everything we could dream of. It will stand us in good stead for the next 120 years.'

The work was only on show on the Bristol street for a matter of hours before it was taken down by the Riverside Youth Project.

Robert Darke, a boxing coach at the project told Mailonline: 'We had a bit of an issue as it is a bit of a rough area and we were really worried it would either be vandalised or stolen.

'So we have taken it in for safekeeping.

'We need to raise £120,000 to stay open and we thought it would be a good idea if we put it on display and people could throw in a few pounds to see it.

'People were a bit adverse at first but they seem to be coming around to us and realise we are doing it to help a good cause.

'We would like to consider Banksy might have placed it where he did on purpose although we could never prove it.

'It was just on a flimsy bit of wood 10 metres away from the premises so we would like to think he is helping out as he's from Bristol so might know the area.'

Leader of the youth group Dennis Stinchcombe, also explained he had been urged to take the piece down by a friend of the elusive graffiti artist.

The 58-year-old added: 'I was approached by somebody who knows Banksy very well.

'He's an artist himself and he said 'you need to take that Dennis, get it into that club - it's what it is meant for'

'Banksy never does his street art on pieces of wood - they are always on walls so they can't be taken away.

'We need £120,000 to keep going and our fundraising appeal has so far only brought a few thousand pounds.

'Now we've ended up with a Banksy on our doorstep.

'It is a dream come true. I'm absolutely buzzing.'

Mr Stinchcombe, who has been working at the youth club for the past 40 years, spotted the piece at 9.15 am yesterday.

Before it was removed, a man and a woman visiting the artwork try to recreate Banksy's new image called Mobile Lovers

He did not believe it was an authentic Banksy until a friend pointed out that it had been confirmed on the artist's website later that day.

The piece had stood unguarded until this afternoon, when he received the tip off from the unnamed man.

'We have taken it off the wall carefully, it isn't damaged at all," he added.

'If anyone wants to see it they can come in here and put a donation in the box if they feel like it.

People gathered to get a snap of the new Bristol artwork by Banksy

The new image did look out onto the A4032, the main road leading into Bristol from the M32 motorway but has now been removed for safe-keeping

'I think it is beautiful, I’m a fan of his work. Whatever way you look at it the man is a genius.

'It isn’t bad graffiti, like this tagging nonsense you see - it is a real work of art.

Speaking before the piece was removed, George Ferguson, Mayor of Bristol said: 'It's good to see another witty Banksy raid on his home city - respectfully painted in a blocked up doorway.

'He is part of what gives Bristol its artistic, creative and subversive spirit which makes us such a sparky place.

'I hope it will be respected and protected as we would want for any other legitimate work of street art.'

Avon and Somerset Police were unable to confirm whether they were investigating the removal of the art work. It is also unclear who owns the wall where the mural was placed.

The Banksy that appeared on the side of a house on Sunday in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire

The
 new Banksy artwork in Bristol comes days after another of his images 
appeared on a end-of-terrace house in Cheltenham on Sunday.

The
 mural depicts three secret agents eavesdropping on conversations at a 
phone box, just a few miles away from the GCHQ surveillance base in 
Gloucestershire.

Karen Smith, 48, heard voices outside her house in the early hours of the morning and then saw men loading screens into a van.

The
 mother-of-five then found the art work on the side of her £300,000 
home, with estimates that it could now treble the price of the home.

Mrs
 Smith said: '‘When I saw it I hadn’t even heard of Banksy. But as soon 
as my daughter saw it she knew straight away and told me how popular he 
is.

'It’s pretty good. It livens the street up a bit.’
