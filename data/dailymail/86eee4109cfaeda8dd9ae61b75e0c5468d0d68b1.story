Ched Evans affair has been made even worse by giving in to the mob 

Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor has issued a fresh apology for appearing to compare Ched Evans' attempt to clear his name with the campaign for justice over the Hillsborough disaster.

Taylor made the comments in a radio interview after it emerged that Evans' proposed move to Oldham had collapsed amid threats to club staff and their families. His remarks provoked outrage among a number of Hillsborough families and their supporters.

An initial apology on Radio Merseyside earlier on Friday prompted Dr Phil Scraton, the academic who was the primary author of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, to claim Taylor had compounded his 'crass and insensitive' comments.

It is with great sadness that today I have withdrawn from talks with Oldham Athletic. I would like to thank the club, and those who have supported me in my lawful quest to find work. I apologise to the club's supporters, sponsors and all those effected by the last 72 hours.

Sadly the 'mob rule' tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if I joined them. The most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of Oldham's new stand it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair.

Upon legal advice, I chose not to discuss the events in question. My silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth.

I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effect that that night in Rhyl has had on many people, especially the woman concerned.

Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so.

Taylor has now issued another apology accepting it had been a mistake to link the two issues and issued a statement on the PFA's website.

He said: 'I would like to apologise unreservedly for linking the Hillsborough case with the situation involving Ched Evans.

'The last thing I intended to do was to upset anybody connected to the Hillsborough tragedy, I can only apologise.'

Taylor said he had 'long been a supporter' of the Hillsborough families, adding: 'I know the people involved and I will be very happy to ring them and let them know that.

'The point I was making was not to embarrass or upset anybody at all among the Liverpool supporters. I'm very much an admirer of them and they know that.'

Scraton had reacted to Taylor's initial apology by telling The Guardian: 'In his telephone interview this morning on Radio Merseyside, Gordon Taylor apologised for any offence he may have caused to the Hillsborough families.

'He then proceeded to compound yesterday's crass, insensitive and wholly inappropriate comments by stating that, 'Ched Evans is a totally different case but he has the same belief of his innocence.''

Evans, now 26, was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman. He maintains the sex in a Rhyl hotel was consensual and protests his innocence. He was released from prison in October, after serving half of a five-year sentence.

Taylor mentioned Evans' situation alongside events that followed the Hillsborough tragedy, which resulted in the deaths of 96 Liverpool supporters at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in Sheffield.

After years of fighting by the families of those who died, new inquests into the deaths began last year and are continuing in Warrington. 

Speaking about Evans' case on Thursday, Taylor had told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'He would not be the first person or persons to have been found guilty and maintained their innocence and then been proved right.

'If we are talking about things in football, we know what happened, what was alleged to have happened at Hillsborough. And it's now unravelling and we are finding it was very different to how it was portrayed at the time - indeed by the police at the time.'

Margaret Aspinall, chairman of Hillsborough Family Support Group, said Taylor's comments were offensive but he shouldn't resign.

She said: 'I accept his apology and I think it's ridiculous for everybody to ask for his resignation. He phrased his wording wrong. 

'There is no comparison and I did find it offensive because you cannot compare what we went through with Ched Evans.

'I don't think he meant it, I think he didn't put his brain into gear.

'He's apologised now and I think we should leave it at that.'

Barry Devonside, whose 18-year-old son Christopher died at Hillsborough, told the Liverpool Echo: 'My feeling is that it was a gaffe on Gordon Taylor's part and it's not the first time Taylor, in his position at the PFA, has made a gaffe.

'He is a man who, in my opinion, seriously needs to think before he opens his mouth.

'It's an absolute disgrace that he should compare Hillsborough to Ched Evans.'

FA Chairman Greg Dyke says there is no basis for the governing body to intervene

It has been widely reported that Oldham Athletic will not be signing Ched Evans, which we can now confirm.

The whole issue has divided opinion and the club has been put under unbearable pressure as a result.

Proceeding could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence. As a consequence the deal could not go ahead.

As a club we condemn all crime including rape and irrespective of any appeal procedure it was always the case that we were prepared to withstand the barrage of abuse that is evident within the country and on social media.

We deplore and condemn the vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff whilst this process has been in the public domain.

Finally, we would like to place our gratitude to all who have supported the club during this difficult period, including the club staff, who have acted with professionalism at all times.

We understand Ched has released his own statement on his website.

The club will not be making any further statement on this matter.
