Thousands of lives a year could be saved by using a dialysis-like device to clean up poisoned blood, research suggests.

Each year, some 37,000 Britons die of sepsis, after their immune system dramatically overreacts to an infection, causing their organs to fail.

This makes sepsis a bigger killer than breast and bowel cancer combined.

Those at risk include patients who have had their appendix removed, as well as people with drips, catheters and even simple urinary tract infections.

Identifying the bug at the root of the problem can take days – and even then the antibiotics used don’t always work.

Researcher Dr Mike Super, who was part-funded by the U.S. military, said: ‘Even with the best treatments, sepsis patients are dying in intensive care units at least 30 per cent of the time.

‘We need a new approach. Sepsis kills at least eight million people worldwide each year and it’s the leading cause of hospital deaths.’

Rather than using drugs to kill the bacteria, the solution may be to remove them from the blood.

Dr Super’s team from the Harvard Wyss Institute in Boston have built a dialysis-like device that removes germs and poisons from the blood.

Tiny magnetic beads coated with substance that attracts numerous types of bacteria, virus and other invaders, are used to catch the germs.

The infection-coated beads are then pulled out of the blood using a magnet and the clean blood put back into the patient.

In tests, 90 per cent of rats treated using the ‘biospleen’ survived potentially deadly infections – compared to just 14 per cent of untreated animals, the journal Nature Medicine reports.

Dr Super said: ‘We didn’t have to kill the pathogens. We just captured and removed them.’

This saves times and means that antibiotic-resistant germs, which are becoming increasing common, should be readily combated.

Researcher Dr Don Ingber said: ‘Sepsis is a major medical threat, which is increasing because of antibiotic resistance.

‘We’re excited about the biospleen because it potentially provides a way to treat patients quickly without having to wait days to identify the source of infection and it works equally well with antibiotic resistant organisms.’

He added that the hopes to start tests on people as soon as possible.
