A mom on a school was killed by a stray bullet after shouting at her kids to run during a gang shootout in her San Francisco Bay Area neighborhood.

Chyemil Pierce, 30,  died Monday afternoon outside her home in Oakland, reports The San Francisco Chronicle.

Her seven-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter, who ran around the house and hid as bullets flew, weren't hurt.

A mom on a school has been killed by a stray bullet after shouting at her kids to run during a gang shootout in her San Francisco Bay Area neighborhood. Chyemil Pierce, 30, died Monday afternoon outside her home 

Investigators say a gunbattle apparently broke out as Pierce, a human resources employee at Kaiser Permanente, was heading home after picking up her kids from school.

Witnesses say up to 50 shots were fired.

The newspaper reports that two people possibly tied to the fight, a teenage boy and a man, were wounded but expected to survive.

No arrests have been made.

A contractor working at Pierce's home told SFGate that he was inside working when he heard the gunfire. 

He said he saw Pierce's children running around the side of the home and then hide. 

The family was walking home on the 2800 block of Chestnut Street (pictured)  when a confrontation between two groups erupted further north.  Witnesses say up to 50 shots were fired

He said he grabbed them and tried to shield them from seeing their mom's body.   

'Now they don't have their mom. That's sickening,' he said.

'That's very crazy. Who are these crazy-a** people? She wasn't involved in anything!'

Pierce, who had plans to marry, also leaves behind a one-year-old son who was not there during the shootout.

Lt. Roland Holmgren, with the Oakland Police Department, told Pix 11 said it was all connected to a violent gang feud in the neighborhood.

'Senseless gun violence and at the end of it a woman who has nothing to do with it, who is doing nothing more than trying to get her children to safety loses her life and the children lose their mother,' Holmgren said.

No arrests have been made.
