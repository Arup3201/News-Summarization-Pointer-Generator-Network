An injured bear cub is recovering in Arizona after a man who initially mistook it for a dead dog along the side of the road scooped it up and drove it 80 miles to get help.

Radio station KTAR-FM reported that Christopher Morris of Payson tried to find a shelter for the bear, only to find out they were full.

'Finally, he located [Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center], secured the cub in a small wire crate, and made the nearly 2-hour drive down from Payson to our sanctuary, to get the cub some help,' the Scottsdale center said in a Facebook post.

The post continued, 'Our volunteer vets, Dr. Nick Robl and Dr. Marlene Tremblay, were waiting on the cub’s arrival and, after an exam and xrays, discovered a fracture in his left front leg.' 

The Associated Press, however, noted that Morris' trek was closer to one hour long.  

'Other than the broken leg, the cub seems to have escaped without injury,' the center wrote on Facebook. 'He weighs about 20 lbs. and is around 4 months old.'

Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center also uploaded a video of the bear cub Sunday, which shows it curled up with a blanket and making various noises.

In text accompanying the video, the center said the cub 'may also have suffered some head trauma, in addition to his fractured leg. It is our hope he can be released, but only time will tell.'
