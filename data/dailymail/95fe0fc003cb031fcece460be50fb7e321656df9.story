Warm weather is forecast across Britain today meaning continuous sunshine could be on the way for the next 40 days – if British folklore is to be believed.

Many will welcome the fact the Met Office is forecasting bright sunshine and temperatures of 25C, as superstition states that if the sun shines on July 15, it will continue to do so for the next 40 days.

However, the St Swithun’s Day folklore also states that if it rains today, it will continue to do so for 40 days – although most of Britain doesn’t have to worry as forecasters say there is a ‘very slim chance’ of scattered showers across the country today.

Temperatures were expected to reach 25C across many parts of the country yesterday before soaring to the late twenties on Thursday and Friday making Britain hotter than some European holiday destinations including Ibiza, Nice and Barcelona.

Temperatures could rise to a sweltering 30C in many parts of the country on Thursday and Friday, including in the south east which is set to enjoy some of the warmest weather in the UK over the next few days.

Despite experts warning yesterday that
 rain could dampen St Swithun’s Day, forecasters today said temperatures
 would soar to 25C and continue rising towards the weekend.

Most
 places across the UK will remain fine and dry today, including in 
Manchester, Birmingham, London, Newcastle and Exeter - where the chance 
of rain is less than five per cent.

Met
 Office forecaster Dan Williams said there was a ‘very low possibility’ 
of rain today, and said as a whole the UK would see ‘mostly dry’ 
conditions with ‘plenty of cloud around but sunny spells’.

Wednesday also looks promising, with the bulk of England and Wales likely to remain dry and sunny.

It
 will herald the start of another hot spell in Britain, where 
temperatures could exceed those in popular European holiday destinations
 such as Barcelona, Ibiza and Nice.

Temperatures
 will start to rise from Thursday, peaking on Friday when the 30C 
barrier could be reached for the first time this year, with the most 
likely location somewhere to the north-west of London.

Forecasters say there is is a 'very good chance' the hottest day of the year so far could be surpassed by Friday. The hottest day of 2014 so far was July 4, when 28.7C (83.7F) was detected in Norfolk and Essex.

However, the balmy conditions towards the end of the week – which could see the hottest day of the year so far surpassed – could bring ‘thundery’ rain.

Mr Williams said there was a chance heavy showers could develop in parts of the UK on Thursday before it clears later in the afternoon.

However, despite the blip, temperatures are expected to rise to a sweltering 30C in many parts of the country on Thursday and Friday, including in the south east which is set to enjoy some of the warmest weather in the UK over the next few days.

However, despite the ‘hot and humid’ weather, forecasters have warned the conditions could be uncomfortable for some as it will feel muggy instead of fresh.

Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said ‘thundery downpours’ could give brief respite from the hot and sticky weather on Friday and Saturday.

She said: ‘Most people won't enjoy these conditions. It can be difficult sleeping during the hot humid nights.

‘Although it probably is shorts and T-shirt weather, you will need a brolly at the same time.’

Many will be relieved it stayed dry  to coincide with the folklore of St Swithun's Day. While legend states that rain on July 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days, it also says that if it remains dry for the day, the country will be in for 40 days of sun.

The conditions, which should ease when a band of fresher air sweeps in on Sunday, are not expected to trigger the Met Office's official threshold for a heatwave.

For those looking forward to the next wave of warm weather, many will be relieved that it is expected to stay dry today to coincide with the folklore of St Swithun’s Day.

While the legend states that rain on July 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days, it also says that if it remains dry for the day, the country will be in for 40 days of sunshine.

The British folklore dates back to c.800, when St Swithun was a Saxon bishop at Winchester Cathedral.

As he lay on his deathbed he asked to be buried outside where he would be trodden on and rained on.

His wishes were followed for nine years, then on July 15, 971, the monks of Winchester attempted to remove his remains to a shrine inside the cathedral.

This week's warm weather heralds the start of another hot spell in Britain, where temperatures could exceed those in popular European holiday destinations such as Barcelona, Ibiza and Nice.

According to legend, the removal was accompanied by ferocious and violent rain storms which lasted 40 days and nights and were said to indicate the saint's displeasure at being moved.

The story soon became British folklore and ever since the weather patterns on July 15 have been closely followed by the superstitious.

The folklore’s rhyme reads: 'St Swithin’s day if thou dost rain, For 40 days it will remain. St Swithin’s day if thou be fair, For 40 days ’twill rain no more.'

However, the Met Office has routinely said there is no ‘scientific evidence’ supporting the folklore and said numerous studies have been carried out on past weather observations, with none proving the legend to be true.

It also said that since the start of records in 1861, there has been neither 40 dry or 40 wet days following the corresponding weather on St Swithun's Day.

While it is unlikely that any one location will see rain fall every day for the next 40, there is some element of truth to weather patterns continuing.

By this point in the summer, the jet stream is usually set in a pattern which tends to last until the end of August.

The jet stream is a fast-flowing current of air located around four to seven miles up in the atmosphere.

It tends to steer the areas of high and low pressure around the globe and marks a boundary between cold air to the north and warmer air to the south.

If it is sitting to the north of the UK, then warm air tends to invade from the south, usually associated with high pressure building in from the Azores, leading to fine and settled weather for the British Isles.

However, should the jet stream sit across the UK or to the south, then cooler air from the north is dragged down and low pressure systems move across the country from the Atlantic, leading to unsettled weather.

So far, the jet stream is pointing directly towards the British Isles, indicating unsettled weather.
