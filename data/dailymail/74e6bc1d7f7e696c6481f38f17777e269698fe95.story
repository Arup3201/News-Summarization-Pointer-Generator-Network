It is the app that can learn your thoughts, habits, likes and dislikes.

It can predict who you want to talk to, where you want to go, and even help you type faster than ever before.

Swiftkey, a replacement keyboard for mobile phones, today went free in bid to replace the built in keyboards on mobile phones and tablets.

The SwiftKey Keyboard replaces a mobile device¿s keyboard with one that understands language and learns your personal writing style over time.

SwiftKey works by understanding how words work together in context and continually learning to improve its knowledge.

This means it can predict your next word when typing, but also radically improves the accuracy of autocorrection.

The app also lets you type by sliding your fingers across the screen, which can speed things up.

It can also store your preferences online so they can be used on all your gadgets, and is constantly updated with trending phrases as new words becmome popular.

The SwiftKey Keyboard replaces a mobile device’s keyboard with one that understands language and learns your personal writing style.

'With the latest version of SwiftKey Keyboard, we’re providing an even more intuitive and personalized experience for our users, which they’re increasingly expecting,' said co-founder and CTO Ben Medlock.

'We’ve expanded our design team to focus on developing creative and beautiful user experiences.'

The app launched in 2010, and is one of the world’s best-selling Android applications, spending more days at number one on Google Play than any other paid app.

Earlier this month the firm revealed it is planning a version for Apple's iOS after the firm decided to allow alternative keyboards for the first time.

Joe Braidwood, SwiftKey’s Chief Marketing Officer, told MailOnline the firm is confident it will have the app ready to go for the official release of the iOS 8 software, expected to be in September.

The firm was set up by two Cambridge graduates, Jon Reynolds  and Dr Ben Medlock, 33 and it boasts it has saved users over 50 billion keystrokes, with over 6 million downloads.

'I went into the civil service and saw someone in a meeting typing on a Blackberry in a really cack-handed way, and I started to talk to Ben about how to improve this,' said Reynolds.

SwiftKey in action: The free app can predict the next word, and let users type by swiping across the keyboard.

'It was his background in computational linguistics that made it work - we wanted to improve the correction.'

In addition to new themes, the update brings several other user-requested improvements.

Support for over 800 emoji is now integrated directly into the keyboard, with a new prediction feature that learns how emoji are used and predicts them as you type.

The firm now says it will make money by selling add on 'theme' keyboards.

Jon Reynolds said: 'This is the start of an incredibly exciting phase for us as a business.

'We have made the decision to go free to better enable everyone, everywhere, to use SwiftKey’s market-leading technology without payment being a barrier.

'We’re focused not only on reaching more users with our powerful technology, but on building great content and features to engage them.'
