Eoin Morgan took a big step towards accepting his days as a Test cricketer are over by paving the way for his return to the Indian Premier League.

The England one-day captain’s decision to put his name forward for the IPL auction on February 17 in Bangalore is a realisation that he remains further away than ever from adding to his 16 Test appearances.

This time last year Paul Downton, then the new managing director, persuaded Morgan to miss out on the Twenty20 riches in a clear indication that England wanted to give him another chance to prove he can thrive in the ultimate game.

Yet he failed to score enough first-class runs with Middlesex to stake a claim to face Sri Lanka and India last summer and seemingly realises that he is better off concentrating on the limited-overs formats that made his name.

‘My ambition is still to play Test cricket, absolutely, but given where I’m at at the moment I think the IPL is the best thing for me,’ said Morgan ahead of Friday’s winner takes all Tri-series match against India.

Morgan, who will not miss any England one-day cricket while he is in India, has always said that he wants to revive a Test career that was derailed against Pakistan three years ago but has now had to scale down his ambitions.

‘The opportunity I gave myself in missing the IPL was the potential carrot at the end of the road,’ said the former Bangalore and Kolkata player. ‘I think there were three positions available in the Test team at the start of last summer but I didn’t manage to get any of them. So since then it’s been scaled down a bit.’

The immediate conclusion is that Morgan and Ravi Bopara, who will also join the auction, believe they have no chance of being picked for the three-Test tour of West Indies that follows swiftly on from the World Cup.

That tour clashes with the IPL in its entirety meaning that no Test players will be able to even have a short stay in India, as has been possible previously.

It also raises major questions over the strength of the West Indies side that England will face in April as many of the Caribbean’s best players, at loggerheads with their own board, may decide to put Twenty20 money ahead of Test cricket.

The ECB will have no qualms about Morgan throwing in his lot with the IPL this time because there is a growing acceptance that it is in England’s best interests for as many of their players as possible to experience the IPL and the Big Bash, which has been incredibly successful here this year.

There is also so much cricket now, particularly this year, that the ECB realise it will become harder for players to feature in all formats and accept England will increasingly move towards different teams for different cricket.

Morgan, as a new international captain, believes he will benefit from returning to a competition that includes many of the world’s best players but few from England because of fixture clashes and workloads.

‘It’s nice to have one ear to the ground both by playing in the Big Bash and potentially the IPL again,’ he said. ‘It’s very useful because cricket is changing so much that it’s good to have new, fresh ideas.

‘I think any England player who has the chance to play in these competitions should grab it with both hands. It’s a great experience and a huge opportunity to put yourself under pressure and bridge that gap between our domestic game at home and the international game.’

Rohit Sharma, who hit 264 on his own for India in a one-day game last year against Sri Lanka, had a fitness test at the WACA today on the hamstring injury that has kept him out of the Tri-series so far.

And if he comes through it and plays in Friday’s game it will be a major boost to an India side who have looked weary and, frankly, uninterested in this tournament so far having already been in Australia for nearly four months.

But England remain strong favourites to repeat their comprehensive defeat of India at the Gabba, particularly with the WACA pitch expected to provide its usual bounce. The winners play Australia in Sunday’s final.
