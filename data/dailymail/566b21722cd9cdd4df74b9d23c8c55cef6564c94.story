The stepmother of missing Oregon boy Kyron Horman has been named the primary suspect in his disappearance by a judge overseeing the civil case.

Judge Henry Kantor named Kyron’s stepmother Terri Horman as the ‘prime suspect’ in the boy’s 2010 disappearance, despite Terri’s yet clean criminal record.

He added that the $10million civil suit against her, filed by Kyron’s biological mother Desiree Young, could proceed.

Little Kyron, a bespectacled blonde boy with a toothy smile, disappeared on June 4, 2010, aged 7, after attending a science fair at his school in Portland and has not been seen since.

In his ruling, Judge Kantor wrote: ‘Witnesses and evidence may disappear. Memories may fade. The opportunity to find Kyron alive or dead, lessens.’ 

Ms Young accused Horman of knowing what happened to Kyron. She told the East Idaho News in June: ‘I believe that Terri Horman knows where Kyron is. I believe that Terri Horman is responsible for where my son is.’

The suit Ms Young filed asks the judge to order Horman to return Kyron or, if he is dead, reveal where his remains are located.

According to NWCN.com, Horman was the last to see Kyron alive. Ms Young’s civil suit accuses her of kidnapping him from Skyline Elementary.

Following Judge Kantor’s decision, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office released a statement that stated the civil case was separate from the continuing criminal investigation against Horman.

The statement read: 'While there may be rulings regarding the court's opinions as to how the case may proceed, these rulings/legal opinions are part of the civil court case. The civil case is a process that is independent of the active, on-going criminal investigation being conducted by the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office.

Investigators have long focused on Horman, although until this point, had not named her as a suspect or filed criminal charges.

When the lawsuit was filed June 1, Young's attorney, Elden Rosenthal, said it would be on a 'parallel track' with the criminal investigation. He would not say what kind of reaction the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office gave when he informed them of Young's decision to sue.

Horman believes the suit is working to advance the aims of local law enforcement. She points out that the judge hearing her divorce from Kyron's father, Kaine Horman, delayed that case while the criminal investigation plays out.

'Plainly and simply, Young's lawsuit is a quest for information to move the criminal investigation forward and to taint any jury pool,' according to the filing.

Civil allegations require a lower standard of proof — a preponderance of evidence — than criminal charges, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

Compelling her to testify, Bunch wrote, could force Terri Horman to invoke her constitutional right against self-incrimination, pointing out the weak spots in her case.

'The burden on Horman of being required to participate in this lawsuit before the district attorney and police have completed their investigation squarely jeopardizes her constitutional rights,' Bunch wrote.

'We've racked our brains trying to think 
of reasons why. We cannot come up with anything. It’s like a portal 
opened up in the school and Kyron just vanished into it.'

According to local news reports at 
the time of his disappearance, Horman took her stepson to a science fair
at the school that Friday morning.

Initial sheriff’s reports said that Horman saw Kyron walking off to his classroom, and judging that he was on his way, left.

The teacher of Kyron’s class didn’t see him at the 10am start, and marked him absent.

His parents were alarmed when Kyron didn’t get off the school bus that afternoon, and called the school. Skyline, in turn, called 911 to report the boy missing.

According to East Idaho News, the police department has spent a collective 28,000 hours searching for him.

Horman’s former husband Kyron Horman first filed a restraining order against her and later divorced her. They have a young toddler together.

Ms Young told Good Morning America in a 2010 interview that her son’s disappearance was ‘a parent’s worst nightmare.’

She said: ‘We’ve racked our brains trying to think of reasons why. We cannot come up with anything. It’s like a portal opened up in the school and Kyron just vanished into it.

‘It’s a mystery.’
