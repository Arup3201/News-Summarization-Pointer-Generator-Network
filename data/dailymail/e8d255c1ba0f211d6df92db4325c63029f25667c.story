A rare, jewel-encrusted Cartier brooch bought in a box of costume jewellery at a flea market for £38 has sold at auction for £10,800.

The gold brooch, which is covered in emeralds, sapphires and diamonds and a ruby, was discovered by an anonymous shopper at a table-top sale in Staffordshire in August.

It went under the hammer on Friday, selling for more than double its guide price of £5,000 after interest from around the world.

Bargain: The tiny pin, which is made of a ruby, emeralds, sapphires and diamonds, was found at a flea market in Staffordshire by an anonymous seller in August

The Art Deco 'tutti-frutti' jabot brooch has a carved ruby mounted as a flower, with blue sapphires and green emeralds interlinked between diamonds.

The engraving 'Carter, London' is hidden on the side.

Collectors from Paris, USA and the United Arab Emirates were all after the 'flavour of the month' jewellery item, although the successful bidder has chosen to remain anonymous.

Hansons Auctioneers, in Etwall, Derbyshire, who held the auction, said it was a 'real rarity' to come across such a brooch.

Collectors from around the world were interested in the rare 1930s Cartier brooch, which sold for £10,800 - more than double its guide price

Hansons head of jewellery, Isabel Murtough, said: 'Although we have sold such high-value jewels in the past, the brooch is such an iconic representation of Cartier's craftsmanship in the Art Deco period, it was an absolute privilege to be selling it. 

'Despite all the television shows, it just goes to show what can still be uncovered at jumble sales, flea markets and even car boot sales. Although bargains may not be so frequent today, such exciting finds are still clearly out there.

'It's is a fascinating find and a real rarity to uncover.' 

She added that the pin was crafted in high-carat gold, and was expected to sell for between £5,000 and £8,000, 

The pin eventually sold for far more - £10,800 - 284 times higher than the original £38 paid for it.

Hansons said the jewel is from the 'vibrant 1930s' and is a 'flavour of the month among the high-end jewellery buyers of Paris, London and Geneva'.

Charles Hanson, the auction house's manager said: 'It is amazing what bargains can still be discovered at car boots and local table-top sales.

'With interest from buyers in the USA, United Arab Emirates, Paris and further afield, we were delighted here in Derbyshire to give it a good send off.'

Cartier was founded in Paris in 1847 by Louis-François Cartier, and the company remained under family control until 1964.

It has a long history of sales to royalty and celebrities. King Edward VII of England referred to Cartier as 'the jeweller of kings and the king of jewellers'.

For his coronation in 1902, he ordered 27 tiaras and issued a royal warrant to the jeweller.
