Sampdoria are optimistic that Samuel Eto'o will join them this month despite late interest from New York Cosmos.

The Cameroon forward is yet to reach an agreement with Everton to leave the Premier League but has reportedly agreed an 18-month contract with the Serie A side and is willing to reduce his wages by 40 per cent in order to return to Italy.

However, the former Barcelona star remains contracted with Everton until June 2016 and the Toffees want to find a replacement for him before any deal is concluded, according to Samp sporting director Carlo Osti.

Osti told Sky Italia: 'Our agreement with Eto'o has almost been finalised.

'He wants to join Sampdoria, those are his intentions.

'He is currently negotiating with Everton to resolve his contract with them.

'Everton are looking for a replacement.

'It might take a day more than expected, but we are moderately optimistic on Eto'o and hope he can arrive as soon as possible.

'I think Eto'o is a player of great character who can only help this group of mature players grow even more.'

The 33-year-old was seen boarding a train at Manchester Picadilly station on Wednesday, although it is unknown where he was heading.

The forward was typically well dressed wearing a co-ordinated grey ensemble with a Fedora hat and Chanel backpack that retails at an astonishing £2,100.

Eto'o spent two seasons at Inter Milan and was a member of the 2010 treble-winning side that won the Serie A title, Coppa Italia and Champions League under Jose Mourinho.

Samp, coached by Sinisa Mihajlovic, are fourth in Serie A, level on 33 points with third-placed Napoli at the halfway stage of the season.

Meanwhile, New York  Cosmos have not given up hope of partnering the former Chelsea striker with Raul in the North American Soccer League (which is not affiliated with the MLS).

Cosmos sporting director and coach Giovanni Savarese told Tuttomercatoweb.com: 'It would be a really great thing to see such a partnership.

'They've both done great things and it would be beautiful, but we respect Everton's wishes and they will decide further down the line if there will be the possibility of selling Eto'o.'

A spokesman of the New York club echoed Savarese's sentiments, telling ESPN FC: 'Samuel Eto'o is under contract with Everton. We think he would be fantastic in New York, but we can't speak with Samuel until we have permission from his club.

'We have great respect for Everton and [manager] Roberto Martinez and we will always go about these things in the most professional way.'
