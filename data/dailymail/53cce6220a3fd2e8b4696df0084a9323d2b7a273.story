At 40 weeks pregnant, a Florida mom had heard plenty of advice on how to induce labor - spicy food, laxatives, castor oil - but she chose a different route: dancing. 

Bonnie Northsea, from Gainsville, tried to dance her baby out of her womb my moving along to Michael Jackson's 1980's pop song Thriller. 

She can be seen shimmying and shaking to the hit in a video she uploaded to YouTube last week.

'Someone told me that Thriller would induce labor,' Northsea said in the video's description. 'Here I am on my due date 40 weeks, February 11, looking like a fool.' 

She added that her husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer last month, which has been emotionally difficult for the family. 

'This video really helped as it has caused me to laugh over and over again,' She said.

The couple also has a three-year-old son, according to Yahoo.

It is unknown if Northsea's attempt to induce labor was successful.
