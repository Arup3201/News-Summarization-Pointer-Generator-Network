A gunman terrified a rural Texas community during random drive-by shooting rampage early Sunday in which he killed one person and wounded five others.

Suspect, a 23-year-old man from North Carolina, died in a shootout with police in Concho County, Texas, about 6.30am after he wounded the county sheriff.

For two hours, the man - armed with an assault rifle, a handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition - opened fire on unsuspecting motorists from his pickup truck as he drove around the remote central Texas county.

Wounded: Concho County Sheriff Richard Doane was shot when the gunman opened fire on his patrol car. He was treated for non-life-threatening injuries

The Texas Department of Public Safety said Alicia Torres, 41, was shot dead in her car.

The Texas Rangers and other law enforcement authorities report multiple shooting scenes in 
Concho County, a rural community with a population of 4,000 about 250 miles southwest of Dallas.

Authorities have not commented on a motive for the shootings, but they believe the gunman chose his targets at random.

The first shooting took place about 4.30am when the suspect opened fire on vehicle near Eden, wounding a woman, who was later hospitalized in San Angelo, authorities said.

The suspect wounded two more people a short time later as they sat in their truck outside a convenience store in Brady, and then returned to Eden, where he fired on another vehicle and wounded another person.

Those three were treated and released.

About 6am, Torres was found shot to death in her car in Eola.

Some 15 minutes later, Concho County Sheriff Richard Doane encountered the suspect on a highway north of Eden.Â 

The man opened fire on the squad car, wounding the sheriff.

Doane was taken to a San Angelo hospital with non-life threatening injuries, authorities said.

Moments later, a Highway Patrol trooper and a game warden, who responded to the sheriff's calls for backup, arrived and engaged the gunman.

He was killed in the ensuing shootout.
