People traffickers brought women to Britain on £10,000-a-year student aid packages before forcing them into prostitution, a court heard.

Romanian authorities say they have uncovered a scam on British taxpayers, who unwittingly fund thugs and pimps to come here posing as students.

The pimps then use the same racket to bring in women who are coerced into becoming prostitutes. 

Alex Mandache (circled top right), investigated over allegations he had taken girlfriend Mariana Lungu to the UK before forced her into prostitution. He is also alleged to have helped friend Andrei Ciacaru (circled bottom right) bring his prostitute girlfriend to Britain (pair are pictured with unnamed people not connected to case)

The scam emerged a day after watchdogs laid bare abuses of the student loan system following an expansion in private colleges. 

The National Audit Office found more than £5million was paid in error to 992 EU students.

Romanian builder Alex Mandache, 32, was accused by ex-girlfriend Mariana Lungu, 24, of luring her to Britain with the promise of a college place.

Romanian prosecutors said: ‘She alleges that when she was there he forced her into prostitution.’

Mandache told police he had been a student at St Patrick’s College in London, but prosecutors said: ‘Given that he didn’t even manage to gain a high school-leaving certificate, it seemed extremely dubious.’

Investigators found that dozens known to police as prostitutes and thugs had become students in Britain. When asked to prove eligibility for financial aid, they simply said they would provide documents later. They then pocketed the money – and failed to produce any paperwork.

Prosecutors quizzed Mandache and demanded to know what he had been doing in the UK, and were shocked when he claimed to be a student at St Patrick's College in west London

Mandache arrived in Britain in 2007 and in 2012 enrolled at St Patrick’s, where he received £10,250 a year in aid. He helped friends to enrol, charging each a £1,000 fee, the authorities said.

Miss Lungu told police she had a fling with him in 2013, adding: ‘The relationship cooled, but then he offered to bring me to Britain.’ 

Officials say he also brought in a friend, Andrei Ciacaru, and his girlfriend, a prostitute. 

Ciacaru told them: ‘I paid him £1,000. He enrolled me into management or business studies – something like that. Each student received £10,000 a year.’

St Patrick’s said it could not comment for legal reasons, but added: ‘The statement that the college is in any way involved in helping any students... to apply for student support is entirely without foundation. 

'All students go through a rigorous admissions process, which involves personal interviews.’

The Department for Business said it was continuing to tighten rules for private colleges.
