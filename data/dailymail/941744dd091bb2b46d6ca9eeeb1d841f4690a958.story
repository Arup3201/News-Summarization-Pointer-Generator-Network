Harry Styles, Jessica Alba and even a Beyonce fan have all been subject to the 'photobomb'.

In fact, the photobomb - or a photograph that has 
been spoiled by the unexpected appearance of an unintended subject in 
the camera’s field of view as the picture was taken - was so prevalent this year that it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.

In Hollywood, 
photobombing has become a tit-for-tat game among the stars, especially 
at big awards events, when the opportunities to intrude a photo are 
endless in a sea of cameras - just ask professional photobomber Jennifer Lawrence.

Now you see her, now you don't! Spruced Up! is a new app that aims to help remove photobombers from your snaps - sorry Beyonce!

Has your otherwise perfect photo been 
hijacked by a photobomber? Got an ex or former best friend you want 
erased from your favourite snaps? Want to banish those blasted 
blemishes, remove tattoos, tone down excessive shine or correct ‘hair in
 face’ photos? Now you can.

Spruced up!, a professional retouching app, aims to enhance and preserve your pictures as you choose, with a little help from some of the most talented ‘sprucers’ in the industry - you can even add someone into the photo who missed the opportunity because they were in the toilet.

Bye, Niall! The app lets you send your bombed snap off and 48 hours later it will be returned without the photobomber (in this case, One Direction's Niall Horan, who is gatecrashing Harry Styles' snap with a fan)

The new app lets you upload your problem photos and pinpoint the changes you would like to make before professional photo ‘sprucers’ get to work on them. The app then alerts you when your photo is ready to download for a price of £4.48  (£2.49 minimum charge + £1.99) per picture.

The only problem is you'll have to be patient; it takes 48 hours for your perfected snap to come back.

The team of professional retouchers have retouched everyone from The Queen and Kate Moss to Madonna and The Rolling Stones and often work on many of the high-profile advertising campaigns you see in glossy magazines including brands such as Christian Dior, Calvin Klein and Swarovski.

Is it better with him or without him? From £2.49 you can have the photobomber, such as George Clooney, erased from the snap - as if he was never even at the event

Founder Rob Willingham said: 'Spruced up! has a straightforward concept: to bring high-end photo retouching services to the masses. I wanted to provide the kind of high-end service usually reserved for advertising clients with multi-million pound budgets, but at super-competitive high street prices.

'It’s all about giving people the opportunity to perfect their photos; a service that simply doesn’t exist at this level. It has taken a year to create the Spruced up! website and app. As a retoucher (and perfectionist!) I wanted it to be very user-friendly and super-quick to use.

'Unlike many photo-editing apps, images sent to Spruced up! will be worked on individually and by real-life, skilled members of the team. We’ve created an easy-to-use service which will deliver your images to you within just 48 hours, perfectly retouched and ready to wow.'

Did someone ruin your perfectly nice photo? Now you can get rid of them with the help of the sprucers at a new app, who have worked with the likes of Madonna and the Rolling Stones
