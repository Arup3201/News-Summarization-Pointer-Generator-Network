A TV weatherman has been arrested over allegations that he had sex with two underage boys, it has emerged.

Robert Lopicola, a former WPTV weatherman in Florida, is now facing sexual offences charges relating to two separate encounters with the teenagers.

According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokesman Teri Barbera, Lopicola was arrested at his home in Wilton Manors today, the Sun Sentinel reported.

The arrest and subsequent charges relate to two separate incidents.

He is first accused of trading sexually explicit pictures online and then having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old in Boca Raton.

He is alleged to have met the minor through an advertisement on Craigslist in 2010, the Sun Sentinel reported.

The arrest report also states he repeated the process with a boy of 17 in West Palm Beach in 2011.

His first appearance before court was delayed so he could obtain a lawyer.

However, court documents revealed that the teen in 2010 initially lied about his age and told Lopicola he was 18.

However, when the teenager revealed his true age, Lopicola is said to have replied with '14 to 16 years old is perfect baby', a probable cause affidavit revealed.

One of the teenagers is also said to have discussed his high school grade with the defendant.

Lopicola has been charged with one 
count of unlawful sexual activity with certain minors, one count of lewd
and lascivious battery, one count of computer pornography and child 
exploitation.

Lopicola is now a personal trainer after leaving WPTV in 2006.
