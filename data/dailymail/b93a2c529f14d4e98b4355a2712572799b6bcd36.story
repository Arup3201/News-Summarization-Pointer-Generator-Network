A former children's nursery worker who stabbed her 'smitten' younger lover 24 times during a drunken argument is facing life in prison after being found guilty of murder.

Petite blonde Michelle Mills, 31, used so much force when she attacked Edward Miller, 20, that the knife penetrated nine inches into his body and the blade broke away from the handle.

She then waited 20 minutes before raising the alarm as her partner lay dying on the living room floor of their cottage in the upmarket village of Scalford, Leicestershire.

Guilty: Former children's nursery worker Michelle Mills, who stabbed her 'smitten' younger lover Edward Miller 24 times, is facing life in prison after being found guilty of his murder

Mills, just 4 feet 11 inches tall and described as 'angelic looking', claimed she feared her boyfriend , who was nearly a foot taller and weighed almost 18 stone, was about to attack her.

The court heard both had a drunken argument and Mills texted a previous boyfriend saying: ‘I still love you and always have. I’m sorry xx.’

In a second text she wrote: ‘I wish I’d never let you go xx.’

Moments later she took a kitchen knife and repeatedly stabbed Mr Miller to death.

Today, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court rejected Mills’ story that she knifed Mr Miller after hearing voices in her head and found her guilty of murder.

Flanked by two security guards, Mills burst in to tears as the jury returned their guilty verdict after a day of deliberations. 

Judge Michael Heath warned Mills there was only one sentence he could pass but told her he wanted time to reflect on the length of her sentence. As she left the court Mills blew kisses to family members in the public gallery.

Murder: The couple had been seen acting affectionately towards each other at the King's Arms pub in the upmarket village of Scalford before the stabbing

Remanding her in custody until next 
Tuesday, Judge Heath told her: 'The jury have convicted you of murder 
and there is only one sentence I can pass in relation to that, that is 
of course life imprisonment.

'I have to decide the minimum sentence you must serve before you can be released.'

The
 jury heard Mills had previously had a vivid dream in which she killed 
Mr Miller, known as 'Eddie', and was so convinced that it was reality 
she woke him up to check he was still alive.

She admitted 'I had a dream that consisted of me killing Eddie. It was on a night when I was in bed with him. I woke him up to check he was still breathing. He was and he was still alive. I felt cruel when I realised it was just a dream.'

The court heard how Mills had attacked two previous partners with a knife and had also threatened Eddie Miller with a blade during their tempestuous two year relationship described by a psychiatrist as 'an explosive combination'.

She was Eddie’s first serious girlfriend whereas Mills admitted to the jury that she had over 70 previous sexual partners.

Brutal: Michelle Mills, 31, used so much force when she attacked Edward Miller, 20, that the knife penetrated nine inches into his body

Mills claimed she was the victim of domestic violence during the relationship but the jury heard that they were 'each as bad as each other' and Eddie, who lived with his mum before moving in with Mills just two months before his death, had suffered assaults at her hands.

The jury heard that Eddie , a management trainee at the upmarket Scalford Hall hotel, died after the couple argued following a visit to a Bonfire Night party at the village pub.

Miss Yvonne Coen QC, prosecuting, said 'What happened to Eddie wasn’t a one-off. It was part of a pattern of behaviour with her partners reaching for a knife when she was extremely angry with them.

'She is a dangerous, manipulative, unpredictable and angry woman who reaches for a knife when she is angry.'

Miss Coen said that during the 
evening Mills texted one of her previous partners, 
saying she still loved him and wished she had never let him go.

'After
 Eddie, on her account, had grabbed her and pushed her on the sofa she 
got away from him. It could have stopped,' Miss Coen told the jury.

“All he wanted to do, it seems, was to sit having a drink. It would seem that she wasn’t going to leave it there.

'She
 wasn’t going to let him ignore her so she took it to the next level by 
taking a knife to him repeatedly perhaps to punish this young man for 
what may have happened between them before but clearly to hurt him very 
severely and during the course of it she actually broke the knife. '

The attack left Eddie bleeding to death on the living room floor.

Mills dialled 999 but despite the efforts of paramedics Eddie was pronounced death after being taken to the Queens Medical Centre at Nottingham. He had knife wounds to his chest, back and abdomen.

Miss Coen added: 'Michelle Mills was considerably older than her boyfriend and obviously had a good deal more life experience.

'He would have been 18 years old when he met Ms Mills. She was Eddie Miller’s first serious girlfriend. It seemed to outside observers they appeared to be completely smitten with each other.

'They were coming to this relationship from very different positions. This was his first ever grown up relationship with a woman. She was an older woman.'

The jury heard that Mills had attacked two previous boyfriends with a knife but neither suffered any serious injury and did not press charges.

Eddie also told his dad, Colin Miller, that Mills had previously pulled a knife on him.

Mr Miller said: 'He said "Look at the size of her. What could she do to hurt me? It was only a small knife anyway.’

The couple got together when Eddie was just 18 and had already talked about marrying.

Eddie’s mum Sara Westle said: 'She (Mills) was never shy in saying Eddie was the one. We spoke about weddings and wedding dresses. She was convinced Eddie was the one.'

Mills wept as she told the jury she loved Eddie and did not mean to kill him.

She claimed the domestic violence she suffered triggered memories of being sexually abused as a child causing her to fly into a rage.

She told the jury that voices in her head told her to 'just do it'.

Mills said 'I have no memory of picking up the knife but I remember using it to stab Eddie. As I walked back into the living room he came towards me.

'I thought he was going to attack me. I stabbed him because I thought he was going to kill me. I stabbed him a second time in the stomach.

'I killed him but I didn’t mean to kill him. I didn’t want to kill him.'

Mills, 31,  of  Scalford, Leicestershire, denied murder on November 6 last year.
