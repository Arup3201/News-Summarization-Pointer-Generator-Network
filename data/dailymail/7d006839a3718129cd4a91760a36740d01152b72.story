A man whose body was found in a cardboard box by the roadside was sliced open across his abdomen because he was carrying drugs inside of him.

Jose Milthon Freddy Azurdia-Montenegro, 55, of Guatemala, has now been charged with one count of misleading a police investigation.

The man who was found by the roadside outside a home in Duxbury, Massachusettes, was Estuardo Leonel Melgar Perez, 34, also of Guatemala and he was smuggling drugs that were those of a so-called drug mule.

Charged: Jose Milthon Freddy Azurdia-Montenegro, 55, of Guatemala has been charged with misleading a police investigation

He had a 14-inch incision in his abdomen, the Plymouth County District Attorney's Office said.

Azurdia-Montenegro has pleaded not guilty and was ordered held on $10,000 bail at his arraignment and was also forced to surrender his passport. He pleaded not guilty.

Police were called to the side of a road last week where the box with human remains was found.

The box containing Melgar Perez's remains was found on July 27 by neighbors who noticed a strong odor coming from the box.

Using fingerprint analysis by the Department of Homeland Security, investigators were able to identify Perez.

Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz said there was a 14-inch incision on Perez’s abdomen.

Although the box had been left by the roadside for several days, it was only noticed when nearby homeowners noticed a revolting smell

'We did conduct an autopsy on the man. The cause and the manner of death are still pending further testing,' he told WBZ NewsRadio 1030 Monday.

Assistant Plymouth District Attorney Peter Maguire said the only injury to the body was the incision, which it appeared was made to 'empty the contents of his stomach.'

Brockton District Court First Justice Julie J. Bernard ordered Montenegro held on $10,000 cash bail and to surrender his passport.

Montenegro’s attorney Scott Bradley said the two men knew each other casually from buying and selling old cars, but that Montenegro knew nothing about Perez’s death and they were not flying back to Honduras together.

'At best he’s a witness who had some information and now they want to keep him in the United States indefinitely.' Bradley said.

Investigators say Perez had arrived in the U.S. on a flight from Honduras to New York just two days before his remains were found and both he and Azurdia-Montenegro had been booked on a flight back to Honduras August 2.

Montenegro initially lied abut knowing Perez and being in the area where the body was found but after he was confronted, he admitted knowing Perez for five or six years and being in business with him to buy cars to bring back to Guatemala.
