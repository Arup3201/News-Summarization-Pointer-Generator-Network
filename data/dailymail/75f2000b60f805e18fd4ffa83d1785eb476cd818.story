Ex-CIA agent Tony Mendez disclosed his Parkinson's disease earlier this month alongside his wife and fellow former spy, Jonna Mendez.

The Mendezes attended a Focused Ultrasound Foundation symposium in October where they broke the news of his disorder, The Washington Post reported.

'If we can fill a room, to get a bunch of people to listen, whether it’s about "Argo," whether it’s about "This is how I deal with Parkinson’s" … then this is just his latest operation,' Jonna Mendez told the newspaper.

Speaking out: Tony Mendez, seen at the 2013 Oscars in this file photo, disclosed he has Parkinson's disease earlier this month 

On the big screen: Ben Affleck portrayed Mendez in the 2012 movie 'Argo' 

Ben Affleck portrayed Mendez in the 2012 film, in a dramatized account of how the real-life CIA agent helped a group of Americans safely get out of Iran.

The couple attempted to cover up his illness during the publicity blitz stemming from 'Argo,' The Washington Post reported.

'He really had trouble accepting that diagnosis,' Jonna Mendez told the newspaper.

'I think [Ben Affleck] just thought that was Tony's demeanor,' she also said. 'But Tony was never taciturn before Parkinson’s.'

Tony Mendez told The Washington Post 'We got to a spot in the disease where it’s not gonna be much fun living. So out of desperation you go back to your physician and go, "What else you got?"'

His condition has improved following the implantation of an electrode into his brain, The Washington Post reported.

Meanwhile, he and his wife are interested in the potential for how Focused Ultrasound may help with Parkinson's, according to the newspaper.

Jonna Mendez recently told The Times 'We were both chief of disguises at the CIA separated by ten years and, I’ve said this to Tony many times, for this Parkinson’s, I’ve been his disguise. I just tried to hide what was going on there.'

She also told the newspaper 'At the Golden Globes, he was on stage with John Goodman. We practised and practised, but it was so hard. Tony muffed his line, but it was almost endearing, it was like, "Oh, he’s a real person, not a movie star who can do this in his sleep." He looked kind of cute.'

Michael J. Fox reportedly reached out to Mendez at the awards ceremony and gave the former spy his phone number, according to the newspaper. 

Tony Mendez told The Times he was not upset with the diagnosis, saying 'No, I took an ‘it’s not happening to me’ attitude. I have used that positive thinking elsewhere in my life and I was fairly confident I could do it again. But time will tell. Everybody’s gotta croak some day.'
