Standoff: What appear to be two teenage girls stand in front of the ice cream man

Attack: The first girl then tries to attack the ice cream man

A girl is seen trying to touch the man's ice cream cart as another girl stands behind her.

The first girl then appears to try to hit the man repeatedly as he attempts to defend himself.

The second girl then lunges toward the ice cream man - not long before an unidentified male also tries to take a swing at him.

As the teens back away from the man, yelling is heard.

The first girl then moves back toward the ice cream man and seems to repeatedly hit him as he tries to dodge her blows.

At different parts of the alleged assault the teens are heard laughing.

The teens eventually run away from the man and his cart at the end of the video.

A fourth unidentified individual filmed the alleged assault.

On the affiliate station's Facebook page, the video has already been shared 170 times and received 202 comments as of this writing.

'This is sad,' one commenter wrote. 'Taking advantage of a poor man who makes a living by selling ice cream that can cost no more than $2 a piece... This isn't about race, it's about education. I hope these young ladies change their ways now, because if they continue to live this way their lives will be nothing but disaster.'

'Such disrespect.....give them time in jail for that...I bet they won't pick on or rob anyone else,' another wrote.

Police told WSOCTV Daishaun Tyrone Burney was arrested and they are looking for two others.
