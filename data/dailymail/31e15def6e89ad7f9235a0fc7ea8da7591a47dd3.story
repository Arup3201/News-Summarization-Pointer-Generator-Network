Charlie Austin and Junior Hoilett scored a brace each as Queens Park Rangers secured a comfortable win against Shamrock Rovers.

Hoops boss Harry Redknapp fielded a near-full strength side for the pre-season friendly clash in Ireland as his side gear up for a return to the Premier League next season.

The hosts were without former boss Trevor Croly after he was sacked earlier in the day and was replaced by caretaker manager John Gill.

Job done: Charlie Austin (left) scored twice in QPR's 4-0 win at Shamrock Rovers on Saturday

Up for it: Austin (far right) scored two bullet headers in the victory at the Tallaght Stadium

QPR: Green; Simpson, Caulker, Dunne, Onuoha, Traore; Barton, Faurlin, Hoilett; Austin, Zamora.

Subs: Murphy, Hill, Karl Henry, Wright-Phillips

Goals: Hoilett 13 and 89, Austin 31 and 90

Gill's tactics proved renderless for his side though as they were swept aside at their Tallaght Stadium.

Hoilett put QPR ahead in the 16th minute after Alejandro Faurlin's through-ball enabled the Canadian to slot past the Shamrock goalkeeper.

Rangers doubled their lead before half-time when Austin grabbed his first with header from a Joey Barton corner.

The visitors then left it late to complete the scoreline with a quick double salvo.

Hoilett scored his side's third with a blistering strike into the bottom corner before Austin made it four with a towering header.
