Laura Carmichael shot to fame playing Lady Edith in ITV's much-loved drama Downton Abbey.

To reflect the time period from 1912 onwards, Laura and her co-stars have worn minimal make-up as cosmetics were not embraced by aristocratic ladies at the time. 

So the actress may look unrecognisble to Downton fans in her latest part starring in a Lisa Eldridge make-up tutorial.

The lady is a vamp: Laura's familiar look as Lady Edith in Downton Abbey, left, and transformed after her smokey eye make-over

The professional make-up artist reveals how she ensures Laura looks glamorous for red carpet events with her smokey eye make-over.

The result is a dramatic, smouldering look which contrasts to her familiar, natural appearance as Lady Edith.

Lisa explains step-by-step how viewers can replicate Laura's smokey eyes.

She begins by smudging black gel eyeliner (L'Oreal's Super Liner Gel in black) onto Laura's eyelids, followed by eye shadow from Charlotte Tilbury's The Rock Chick palette.

She then puts eye liner and eye shadow along Laura's lower eyelid.

Next she applies mascara using Urban Decay's Cannonball Waterproof product.

To give the lashes extra volume, she then adds a few individual false eyelashes to the outside edge. 

As she has created a bold look on Laura's eyes, Lisa keeps the rest of her make-up simple with a Revlon highlighter on the cheeks for a 'fresh faced look' and a pale pink lip colour from Tom Ford called First Time.

During the makeover, Laura reveals how she's always had a passion for acting but her big break didn't come for years after she finished drama school.

Big break: Laura worked as a waitress and receptionist after graduating from drama school before winning her part in Downton Abbey

She explained: 'First I did dance classes and wanted to be ballerina. That led to musicals and then at 16, I did plays at the posh boys' schools down the road and had a great time. Then I knew I wanted to do it so went to drama school at 18.

'After I left drama school it was hairy time for me as an actor as I was having to do lots of different jobs - I was working as a waitress and as a receptionist at doctors' surgery. Then I auditioned for Downton and the call came out of the blue that I had got the part and it really changed things.'

At the end of the makeover, Laura says she loves the new look Lisa has given her.

She adds that she is looking forward to wearing more modern make-up and comfortable clothes in her next film role which is set in the present day.
