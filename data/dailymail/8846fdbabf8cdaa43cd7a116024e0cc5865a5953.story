The charges she faced included failing to provide proper and sufficient food and failure to provide veterinary treatment to four horses in three separate matters.

RSPCA inspectors responded to a complaint regarding horses at a Brownlow Hill property, in Sydney's south-west, in August 2013.

They found a grey mare pony in an emaciated body condition and Ms Hollingsworth was issued with written directions to have the horse seen to by a veterinarian.

A month later, she was issued further directions to provide veterinary treatment but also proper and sufficient food to the grey mare and a bay gelding.

On October 31, the RSPCA were called again to the property where they found the same grey mare in need of urgent treatment. Both horses were taken into care after being found to have dental issues.

The RSPCA was called to a Mulgoa property, near Penrith in Sydney's west, on November 5 in a separate matter after concerns were raised over the emaciated condition of a mare.

The animal was seized and was found to have lice and worms.
