ABC’s political debate show Q&A has come under fire for cutting to a close-up shot of a ginger audience member during a debate on terrorism.

The popular show features a range of panel contributors, who discuss all the hot issues of the week.

During a heated conversation on the topic of terrorism and particularly on Australian-born ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir, the camera shifts suddenly from the panel and focuses in on a man in the audience.

While the panel were busy discussing the serious subject on how to prevent Australians from joining the Islamic State, the program cut to the auburn-haired man, who vaguely resembled the ginger jihadist.

During a heated conversation on the topic of terrorism and particularly on Australian-born ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir, the camera shifts suddenly from the panel and focuses in on a man in the audience.

The man appeared to be unaware that the camera has focused on him and continued to listen intently to the discussion.

The panel also continued on with their ramblings, blissfully unaware of the hiccup, as they debated whether the Afghanistan experience has taught us anything.

However, Twitter users were quick to point out the programs fault, taking to their accounts to vent their anger.

'They always cut to inappropriate on this show' wrote Mark Sanderson.

'Not sure if 'ginger jihadi' or Newtown hipster. #qanda' said ASIO

The major fail came just a week after a propaganda video released by Islamic State appeared online,featuring Australian Abdullah Elmir.

The 17-year-old, who grew up in Bankstown in Sydney's west, also appeared in another video today.

The teen is seen in the latest video on the banks of the river Tigris, surrounded by dozens of men dressed in black wielding weapons.

The video is titled An Evening On The Banks Of The Tigris River In The Province Of Nineveh In The Islamic State, and shows groups of militants chanting and praying.

Just last week Elmir appeared in a chilling video where he condemned Barack Obama and Tony Abbott

Elmir is wearing the same black and white keffiyeh he was seen in the previous video, and is flanking a man speaking to the group.

 Earlier this week reports Elmir could face 25 years behind bars should he ever return to Australian soil emerged.

AFP counterterrorism head Neil Gaughan told the Herald Sun that Elmir, who now goes by the moniker Abu Khaled, has 'basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation'.

'The fact that he is admitting that he is a member of ISIS, which he does in the video, straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code. That’s up to 25 years imprisonment,' he said.
