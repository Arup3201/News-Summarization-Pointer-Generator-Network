A pair of protesters who came all the way from New Jersey to Des Moines, Iowa to lodge a protest against their state's governor, Chris Christie, were thrown out of Saturday's Iowa Ag Summit after they yelled that Christie hadn't done enough to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.

Organizers of Saturday's Iowa Ag Summit warned audience members that they would be escorted out if they caused a scene. Police quickly tossed the pair, including Lisa Stevens, whose sign claimed 'thousands of families' were still displaced from their homes.

Joe Mangino, a man standing with her, barked, 'I will NOT shut up!' Christie had told an activist in October at a Belmar, New Jersey town hall meeting about post-hurricane rebuilding to do just that.

'My people follow me everywhere,' Christie quipped to event organizer Bruce Rastetter as the protesters were marched to the exit and hundreds applauded.

'I'm magnetic, Bruce,' he said. 'They can't stay away from me.'

DEFIANT: Chris Christie dismissed hecklers on Saturday in Des Moines, Iowa who came 1,000 miles to complain about families still displaced more than two years after Hurricane Sandy

EXIT, STAGE LEFT: Lisa Stevens held a sign reading 'Governor Christie: Thousands of families still not home after Sandy' before she and Joe Mangino were quickly escorted out

'And I think you understand that I'll deal with you the same way here as I deal with you in New Jersey,' he told the protesters.

As the pair left the auditorium, Christie said that 'it really is a wonderful country that people can do that.'

Stevens' sign read, 'Governor Christie: Thousands of families still not home after Sandy.' 

Hurricane Sandy was an historic 2012 storm that ravaged America's mid-Atlantic coast, killing 12 in New Jersey and causing more than $20 billion in damage overall.

Mangino said outside that Sandy's aftermath forced him to abandon his home, and that he and his family have moved three times since then.

Tens of thousands in the Garden State were made homeless as 80-mph winds battered the coast and flattened houses, and soe advocates insist the governor hasn't done enough to help. 

'I'm begging you,' one of the hecklers yelled as she was ejected. 

The two weren't the only ones to disrupt the morning's program.

A lone, elderly man interrupted Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as the event began, reading aloud from a sheet of paper a litany of complaints about 'corporate' agriculture.

He too was shown the door to the sound of cheers and one audience member who yelled 'Get him out of here!' 

'It's all about money,' the gray-haired activists had complained.

'There's too much corruption.' 

And then: 'We want clean water!' 

A group of about 50 protesters were gathered outside the Elwell Family Food Center near the Iowa State Fairgrounds, a mixture of organic-only food advocates, backers of 'small, family farms,' opponents of genetically modified food crops, and animal rights activists from PETA. 

Christie, the no-nonsense governor known for boisterous outbursts on the campaign trail, reserved his most emotional words for the Obama administration's fast-evolving policy on Cuba.

The communist island nation, he complained bitterly, has been harboring since 1984 a fugitive who killed a New Jersey police officer in 1977.

The ejected Christie heckler's sign identified her as a member of the New Jersey Organizing Project, a liberal group that is demanding more government funds to fix hurricane damage

'You cannot start trading with a country that is promoting someone who is a cop-killer,' he said of JoAnne Chesimard, the 67-year-old former Black Liberation Army member who escaped from a New Jersey prison in 1979 and has been on the run ever since.

'If they're going to keep harboring fugitives,' he said, 'I have a problem with that ... The president doesn't know how to negotiate. You don't give away the idea of trading with America for nothing.'

The Cuban government refused this week to extradite Chesimard, who has adopted the name Assata Olugbala Shakur, as part of trade negotiations designed to give Cuba access to U.S. markets after a half-century of political freeze. 

'I can say it is off the table,' said Gustavo Machin, the deputy director for American affairs at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during a March 2 interview with Yahoo News. 

In December Josefina Vidal, Cuba’s Head Of North American Affairs, rejected a deal that would have returned Chesimard to the U.S. in exchange for 5 prisoners held in the U.S.

'Every nation has sovereign and legitimate rights to grant political asylum to people it considers to have been persecuted,' she told the Associated Press at the time.

'We’ve explained to the U.S. government in the past that there are some people living in Cuba to whom Cuba has legitimately granted political asylum.' 

Christie also attacked the White House on its economic record, hinting that he favors a wholesale rewrite of America's tax code.

'We tax too much in this country already. We tax in a way that's too complicated,' he said.

'We tax that money at every step along the way. We tax it when you make it, we tax it when you invest it, and then we tax you when you die – and in some states, like mine, we tax your heirs who take it.'

'It's crazy,' Christie said.

Those taxes, he added, hit Americans in concert with an economy that's growing too slow to be sustainable.

'This is the worst recovery in modern history [and] the president takes a victory lap,' he carped.

And touting his own record conducting global trade missions for New Jersey businesses, Christie said the president's approach has been inadequate.

'I think any of us who have seen the president negotiate over the course of the last 6 years is concerned about the way the president negotiates,' he said.
