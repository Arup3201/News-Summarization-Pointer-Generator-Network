Nonchalant: UC Berkley junior Nadia Cho is not concerned about the media frenzy that was set off by her controversial column describing her sex romp on campus

A first-person account of her naked romp in the Library of University of California at Berkley has made Nadia Cho an overnight international sensation, but the psychology major hasn't shared the news with her parents yet.

The Hawaii native, who
describes herself as bisexual, said that she hasn't told them 
that she has been writing sex columns, though she suspects her 
father may have caught wind of it what with the furor surrounding her much talked about  piece.

‘I'm not sure any parent expects this. But I mean, what can you do? I just don't talk to my parents about sex,’ she said.

Cho, a junior at the prestigious California school, went from a virtual unknown to a branded sex expert after writing a column for her college paper about how she had sex all over campus.

The article published in The Daily Californian caught the attention of global media outlets, among them the Daily Mail and the Huffington Post, which ended up hiring Cho as its newest sex columnist.

But speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle this week, the petite 20-year-old dismissed her newfound exposure with a shrug and a sarcastic reply.

'Unless one day I'm going to work for Christians Against Masturbation, I think I'm fine,’ she said.

While headhunters and job experts are busy warning young people to keep their online presence squeaky clean so as not to scare off potential employers later in life, Cho doesn't seem to worried that a Google search of her name yields the term 'sexcapade.'

Berkeley Student Nadia Cho's Twitter Profile reads: 'i like coffee, cats, and ice cream. and being the sex on tuesday columnist at the @dailycal :)'

Online history: While educators warn young people about keep their web presence clean for professional reasons, Cho, seen here apparently smoking pot, is not concerned that her sex escapade would harm her career

Cho's detailed account was part of her weekly column in The Daily Californian, Berkeley’s independent, student-run newspaper.

Cho wrote
that she and an unnamed male student started their romp in Berkeley’s 
library, Main Stacks, the day before Thanksgiving, when the campus was 
‘marvelously empty.'

But other students were in the 
library studying while the two performed and more than one student 
walked by them in mid-act, Cho wrote.

She and her partner then moved into one of Berkeley’s classrooms, as she graphically described.

‘Sex isn’t always about c****** and having orgasms. Sometimes it’s for s**** and giggles,’ she wrote.

‘Having expectations and goals can 
ruin the fun of it. Besides, it’s probably not a good idea to ejaculate 
in public places - just saying. Keep this in mind should you ever 
attempt sex on campus.’

Cho wrote that her experience was inspired by a spring 2012 column for the paper, ‘Sex on campus: actually doable?’

Her response: ‘yes - having sex on campus is actually very doable, and it’s lots of fun. It’s also surprisingly easy.’

After
graduating from college, Cho said she plans to go into research. She currently 
works part time at a campus cafe and has never considered writing 
professionally, she said.

‘I 
don't want to be a sex columnist for my whole life. It has a time and a 
place,’ she told the Chronicle. ’I don't regret publishing the piece. I intended to do 
it. I don't really mind that people know I'm having sex. And who cares 
if it's online - what isn't?’

Cho
was taken aback by the uproar over her piece. In her earlier Sex on 
Tuesdays columns, she has addressed the etiquette of taking part 
in a threesome, taking the stigma out of watching porn, and bisexuality, 
but her writing has generated little reaction on campus.

Even
the now famous column drew only a few comments from fellow students, 
some of whom were critical of her purported exhibitionism, before the 
mainstream media became aware of her escapade.

Liberal college? Berkeley University of California

The
Daily Californian published its first issue in 1871 and is one of the 
oldest college newspapers in the U.S. It became independent from UC
Berkeley in 1971.

The paper, which is now published by the Independent Berkeley Students Publishing Company, has a circulation of about 10,000 and a readership of about 42,000, according to its advertising information.

A spokeswoman for the university said: 'The Daily Cal is not an official university newspaper, it is a student-run, public newspaper and they do not have our backing.

'We have known about that column for a long time but there is nothing we can do about it. The students have a right to free speech.'
