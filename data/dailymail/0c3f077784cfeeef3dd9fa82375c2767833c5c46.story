Football shame: Kidderminster player Lee Vaughan is allegedly attacked by a Stockport County fan this afternoon

Football faced further shame this afternoon as a decisive clash between two sides in the Blue Square Premier League was suspended after angry fans invaded the pitch and allegedly attacked players from both sides.

Kidderminster Harrier's vital final game of the season at home to Stockport County was suspended early in the second half after visiting fans invaded the pitch when their side, who needed to win the match to avoid relegation, went a goal down.

The incident reportedly saw Harriers player Lee Vaughan punched by a fan.

The latest football fracas comes just a week after a weekend of shame for the sport which saw violence mar Millwall's FA Cup tie and the Newcastle versus Sunderland clash in the Premier League.

Lat weekend also saw a football fan arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after allegedly driving into a group of rival fans before Rochdale's match with Port Vale.

Ugly scenes ensued when Harriers Anthony Malbon gave the homes side, who also needed to win to stand any chance of catching rivals Mansfield Town in the promotion race, the lead in the 51st minute.

Angry Hatters fans reportedly confronted players from both sides and defender Vaughan was allegedly punched in the incident as he went to the aid of a rival player who had been confronted by a fan.

A man in his 20s was arrested on the pitch by police on suspicion of assault.

Referee Michael Bull was forced to suspend the game and take the players off the pitch for safety reasons while stewards and police attempted to calm the situation.

The match resumed almost thirty minutes later with Kidderminster eventually winning 4-0.

Lee Vaughan, the player who was allegedly attacked, played on but went on to miss a penalty for the home side.

A tweet from Kidderminster Harriers said: 'Trouble at Aggborough. Fans from Stockport end invade pitch. Punches thrown at Kiddy players. Ref takes players off pitch.'

A statement released by West Mercia Police said: 'After the match, police escorted Stockport County supporters away from the ground, with patrols across Kidderminster during the evening to ensure there was no continuation of disorder. No further arrests were made.

'Around 30 officers were involved in the policing operation, supported by the police helicopter, dog handlers and colleagues from British Transport Police.

'Officers will now be working closely with match officials, both clubs and colleagues from Greater Manchester Police to identify all those responsible for the disorder and take appropriate action against them.

The latest incident comes just a week after violent scenes marred last Saturday's FA Cup Semi Final tie between Millwall and Wigan at Wembley with more trouble breaking out at the Tyne-Wear derby between Newcastle and Sunderland the following day.

Fights erupted among Millwall supporters as their side lost 2-0 to Wigan at Wembley, leaving some fans with bloodied noses and younger ones weeping as they watched fans and officers clash.

And on Sunday Newcastle fans ran amok and clashed with riot police as their side lost to local rivals Sunderland in the Premier League

Earlier this season a Kidderminster fan was stabbed after a fans' coach came under attack from local residents after an away match at Luton Town.Â
