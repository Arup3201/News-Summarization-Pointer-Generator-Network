Dr Tim Luckcock faces calls to resign after he posted this picture on Facebook

A headmaster is facing calls to resign after he posted a picture on Facebook of himself wearing a turban with the  caption: ‘Nearly gone native  in Leicester.’

Dr Tim Luckcock, 49, is head of Uplands junior school in Highfields, Leicester – a city where fewer than half of the population consider themselves white British.

He is thought to have posted the picture as a joke, but it has been seized on by members of his staff who say it is ‘inappropriate’ in a ‘multi-faith school’.

One member of staff, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘A pupil at the school noticed it on Facebook first and he told his mother who informed a member of staff.

‘We are all shocked and pretty  disgusted at it. Leicester is a  multi-ethnic city and the school reflects this.

‘We don’t know if this was Tim’s idea of a joke but it’s in very bad taste and has upset some pupils and their parents alike.’

A spokesman for the Leicester Sikh Alliance said: ‘We applaud anybody who is seeking a  different religious experience in  the genuine quest for understanding and appreciation.

‘But it is incumbent that such an exercise should be performed with respect and not in satire.’

Dr Luckcock, a father of two, said last night: ‘The picture was taken at a school Divali celebration more than a year ago.

‘Most members of staff were wearing similar headgear or Indian clothes.

‘I put the picture on Facebook when I thought my privacy settings were at “friends only”.

‘The story is out of its true context. It’s wrong to infer I’m racist.’

Scandal: Dr Tim Luckcock is headmaster of Uplands Junior School in Leicester

However, an eight-page letter sent by
 school staff to the council accuses Dr Luckcock of ‘religious bias’ and
 calls for his resignation.

Teaching unions said they hoped to meet with the city council on Friday to discuss the grievance.

A spokesman for the council said: ‘We
 can confirm that trade unions have raised collective grievances against
 the head teacher and the governing body.

‘We have scheduled discussions with 
governors and with trade union representatives to discuss how the issues
 can be investigated and be resolved.’

Peter
 Flack, the assistant secretary of NUT in Leicester told the BBC, said: 
'I think the photograph and the comments the head teacher has made are 
totally disgraceful. This is a multicultural city.

'We have multicultural schools serving all faith communities and basically what we have is a head teacher who is mocking that.'

A 2012 Ofsted report ranked the school as 'good' and described the governing body as 'very effective'.
