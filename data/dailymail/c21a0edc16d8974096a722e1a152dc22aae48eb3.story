A teenage girl is lucky to be alive after her glasses deflected a bullet away from her face during a drive-by shooting.

Alonza Bryant, 16, was sleeping on the sofa in her living room at her Seattle home at 
about 9.40pm on Saturday when shots were fired from a dark-coloured Sedan
 as it passed her house.

Several bullets went through the walls and one through the front window, said Seattle police spokesman Detective Mark 
Jamieson.

One of the bullets struck the bridge of the teen's glasses.

She suffered only minor injuries and was treated at a local hospital, he added.

'She is very, very fortunate,' Jamieson said.

Several other people were at the house at the time of the shooting but no other injuries were reported.

Police believe the house was targeted but the girl was not the intended victim.Â 

No arrests have been made in the shooting.

'I could have been dead. I'm glad that the glasses saved me,' the teenager told KOMO News.

'I fell asleep with my glasses on, and the glasses saved where the bullet was.'
