China’s first gay dating app Blued has just secured a whooping £18.9 million investment, simultaneously taking it’s total valuation to £189 million and making it the most popular gay dating app in the world.

With an average of 15 million yearly users, most of whom live in China, it has usurped popular app Grindr which has an average of six million yearly users.

David Chao, co-founder and general partner at DCM Ventures who made the investment in Blued says that he thinks the app is a great move for the gay community in China.

‘People [in China] are more in the closet and less open about it [homosexuality], but the beautiful thing about the smartphone is that it’s a private device,' he said. 

‘Having a very private phone and being able to communicate with the gay community is a dream come true.’

Lu Zhong and Liu Wangqiang are out and proud: It was only in 1997 that homosexuality was legalised in China

The app actually boasts a similar user interface to Grindr allowing the user to scroll through thumbnail shots of potential suitors before clicking on them to send them a message.

They are apparently going to use the new funding to expand the app into different countries.

They are also planning to offer a premium paying service.

Tinder, similarly recently announced plans to develop the app adding in paid for services and an 'undo' button in case you accidentally swipe left for someone you don't fancy.  

It was only relatively recently that homosexuality began to become more acceptable with in the Chinese community.

Up until 1997 it was completely illegal and it was only in 2001 that it was removed from the Ministry of Health's list of mental illnesses. 

However, it is thought that there is still wide ranging discrimination and harassment of gay people in China. There are no laws in place to help with or prevent this.

Dating apps are now part of everyday life but how do you know which one is going to find you your perfect match? We give you the lowdown so you know which app to download...

Tinder

Tinder became incredibly popular in 2013 and recent research claims that the app now matches 10million new potential couples every single day. The app works by showing you a series of profiles with a set of pictures and a short description. Swipe left if you're not interested, swipe right if you are. If it's a match Tinder will let you know and you can get talking.

Happn

Happn was originally launched in Paris and works by showing you people you have crossed paths with. So if you're looking to get chatting to the tube crush you were just too shy to talk to this could be the app for you. Scroll down through the app and click the heart symbol for the people you like, if they like you back it's a Crush and you can message each other.

Grindr

Gay dating app Grindr is hugely popular in the UK and the United States. It shows you thumbnail shots of men who are nearby even telling you how close they are. You can chat away to the people you do like and if you find someone you don't, well, there's a block function for that too!
