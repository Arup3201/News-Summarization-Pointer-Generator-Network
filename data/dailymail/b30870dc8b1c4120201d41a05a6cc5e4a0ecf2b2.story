Remember me? Jose Mourinho will take charge of Porto for Deco's testimonial in July

Superstars: Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho will reunite for Barcelona's Class of '06, coached by Frank Rijkaard

Calls time: Deco called time on his glittering career earlier this year

After kick-starting a generation at the Catalan club, Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard will take charge of fellow European winners in 2006 Barca in the one-off game.

Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o and Henrik Larsson will be on show according to Portuguese publication O Jogo, while Xavi and Andres Iniesta's participation depends on their fitness after the World Cup.

Messi made his debut in a Barcelona shirt at the Dragao Stadium, and the match will give him a chance to link up with his idol once again.

A teenage Argentine eventually oversaw Ronaldinho's departure to AC Milan with his sparkling displays, but owes a lot to the former No 10.

'Ronaldinho made everything much easier for me,' Messi told Barcelona's club website last year. 'He was also responsible for the change in Barça. It was a bad time and the change that came about with his arrival was amazing.

'In the first year, he didn’t win anything but people fell in love with him. Then the trophies started coming and he made all those people happy. Barça should always be grateful for everything he did.'

European success: Barcelona won the Champions League in 2006, while Porto won in 2004

Idol: Ronaldinho helped Messi settle upon his arrival in Spain as a teenager

Deco retired earlier this year after a glittering career. The Brazilian-born playmaker made his name at Porto, starring in that European success in 2004, then moving on to Barcelona.

A switch to Chelsea saw him experience the Premier League, and he finished his career back at Fluminense in Brazil.

Ricardo Carvaloho and Paolo Ferreira will star for Porto, and the game is set to take place on July 25 at 7.45pm.
