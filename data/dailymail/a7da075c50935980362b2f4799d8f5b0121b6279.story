Set for jail: Police officer Jeffrey Davies, 42, looked pale and a little shaken as the verdict was given

A plain-clothes police officer was today given a fortnight’s ‘mercy’ before being jailed for sexually assaulting two female crime victims - one of whom he asked to perform a sex act on him.

South Wales Police detective Jeffrey Davies, 42, was found guilty at Swansea Crown Court of two separate sex assaults on women who came to him to report crimes.

He was unanimously found guilty of one of the counts and guilty by a majority of 10 to two on the second. But he was cleared of a third of exposing himself to another female crime victim.

Both assaults happened in 2010. On each occasion the vulnerable women were crime victims meeting the police officer only due to the process of reporting crimes they had suffered.

Davies, a CID officer at Merthyr Tydfil police station, forced one woman’s hand on to his erect genitals through his trousers as she left a police interview room after giving a statement.

She spoke of her shock at what he had done and the fact that it lasted for up to three minutes.

In the second assault, Davies picked up another female crime victim one evening in the South Wales valley community where she was living.

He drove her to a lane close to her home, touched her leg and repeatedly suggested she carry out a sex act upon him.

The two sexual assaults were carried out 
in 2010. The exposure count of which he was cleared was alleged to have 
happened in 2011.

Judge Paul Thomas QC adjourned sentencing until August 15 despite hearing that reports were unnecessary and Davies was resigned to a jail term.

The judge said he wanted time to reflect before passing sentence and told Davies that, due to the ‘substantial breach of trust involved, there can only be one outcome possible’.

But he released him on unconditional bail, saying: ‘I am prepared to show mercy so that you can put your affairs in order.’ He added: ‘But you must be prepared to lose your liberty when you return.’

Davies looked pale and a little shaken as the jury’s verdict was given. Neither of his female victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was present to witness the outcome of the trial.

South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Richard Lewis, speaking after the verdicts, described Davies’s actions as ‘a gross abuse’.

'His actions are completely unacceptable and abhorrent. His colleagues, who work so hard to keep their communities safe, will feel betrayed and let down'

‘Jeffrey Davies was in a position of great trust within the community he served, but he betrayed that trust with this criminal behaviour,’ he said.

‘A thorough and determined investigation by South Wales Police anti-corruption investigators revealed that Jeffery Davies had committed serious sexual offences against women victims of crime, at a time when they were vulnerable and facing personal trauma.

‘His actions are completely unacceptable and abhorrent. His colleagues, who work so hard to keep their communities safe, will feel betrayed and let down.

‘The actions of this officer were a gross abuse of position and power and will not be tolerated within policing. This investigation demonstrates our determination to robustly tackle any behaviour of this kind’.
