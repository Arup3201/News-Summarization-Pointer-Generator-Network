Newcastle are interested in MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli.

The 18-year-old midfielder is being courted by a number of the Premier League's big guns - Liverpool and Manchester City included. 

But despite not having a manager in place, the Magpies want to land Alli this month and are set to make an approach for the youngster.

The youngster has also attracted interest from the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester City

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp has called the midfielder, who has been likened to Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, the 'real deal'. 

Alli looked set for a move to Anfield in the summer, but the two clubs failed to agree terms.

MK Dons boss Karl Robinson is bracing himself for a bid for the talented 18-year-old

MK Dons boss Karl Robinson said that the club had not received any offers for Alli, but conceded it was only a matter of time.

Speaking to the Shields Gazette, he said: 'There's been a lot of talk over Dele and Newcastle United and certain clubs.

'I think it's a bit more than paper talk but there's nothing that we've heard yet.'
