Opposed: Lord Lester has said that controversial amendments to the Defamation Bill would damage free speech and break human rights laws if allowed to stand

Labour-inspired proposals on media law would curb the free Press in a way ‘never seen in any democratic country’, a senior peer warned last night.

Eminent QC Lord Lester said controversial amendments to the Defamation Bill pushed through with Labour support this month would damage free speech and break European human rights laws if they were allowed to stand.

He accused Labour of ‘hijacking’ the legislation in an attempt to force the Government to implement Lord Justice Leveson’s plans for regulation of the Press in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.

Ministers are said to be so concerned by the proposals that the entire piece of legislation could be abandoned.

But Lord Lester, the architect of the Defamation Bill, said this would be a travesty, as vital reforms of Britain’s notorious libel laws would also be lost.

His intervention comes amid growing Government anxiety about an amendment pushed through the Lords by 272 votes to 141 earlier this month.

The amendment, put forward by Labour-supporting film director Lord Puttnam, would introduce an arbitration service for members of the public wronged by  the Press.

The legislation would mean that newspapers that did not join the system could be punished by courts awarding potentially ruinous damages and costs.

Crossbench peer Lord Skidelsky, who is backing the move, yesterday suggested the arbitration system could help prevent the publication of ‘things which may be true, but whose publication has no sufficient reason’.

He suggested newspapers should face exemplary damages if they failed to get approval from the new regulator before publication.

But Lord Lester said this form of ‘prior restraint’ – which was demanded by former Formula One boss Max Mosley – was only used in a handful of former Soviet states.

Lord Lester said the impact of the Puttnam amendments would be to introduce ‘a form of coercion I have not seen in any democratic country’.

Warning: David Cameron has warned that legislation could prove to be the thin end of the wedge and allow future politicians to interfere with Press freedom

He told the Daily Mail: ‘The scheme they are recommending would be totally incompatible with human rights and free speech. Instead of having self-regulation, which I believe strongly in, you would have a coerced system of arbitration.’

Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat  peer, said the amendment was ‘inappropriate’ as it tacked controversial privacy issues on to legislation on libel reform which has cross-party support, including the stated support of Labour.

He added: ‘They have taken the Bill hostage in order to put pressure on the party leaders and the Press over the implementation of the Leveson reforms.

'But Leveson wasn’t interested in libel law, he was interested in privacy.

‘I very much hope that when the Bill comes back to the Commons we can get agreement across the parties to release the Bill from the limbo it is now in so  that we can get these reforms onto the statute book.’

The Defamation Bill, which has all-party support, would bring in long-overdue reforms to Britain’s antiquated libel laws.

The political parties are still locked in stalemate over how to implement Lord Justice Leveson’s reforms.

Labour is demanding new laws to back up a new independent Press regulator.

But David Cameron has warned that legislation could prove to be the thin end of the wedge and allow future politicians to interfere with Press freedom.

He wants a new regulator to be established by Royal Charter.
