The day appeared to be a memorable one for the Paris Saint-Germain striker who accompanied the photos with the message: 'Gone fishing. Today we had a few hours of spare time after training. I took the opportunity to go fishing with the legend Claes "Svartzonker" Claesson. It resulted in two nice pikes. An unbeatable afternoon!' 

Ibrahimovic was an unused substitute in his country's 1-1 draw against Russia on Thursday as he recovers from an Achilles injury suffered while playing for PSG.

Ola Toivonen's goal crowned a gutsy Sweden fight back after Aleksandr Kokorin put the visitors ahead after 10 minutes.

With four points from their first two games, Russia lead Group G on goal difference from Montenegro and Austria, with the Swedes in fourth place on two points.
