The mother of a missing girl abducted three years ago broke down in tears as she described the moment she saw her daughter again today.

An emotional Gemma Wilkinson spoke to 
members of the press in the Crowne Plaza Hotel at Manchester Airport 
shortly after she was reunited with her daughter.

Gemma Wilkinson, 32, had not seen 
daughter Atiya since she was kidnapped by her father during a birthday 
visit to the seaside, was reunited with the six-year-old last night.

She said: 'I am just absolutely 
overwhelmed at seeing Atiya now and giving her a cuddle and a massive 
kiss. I am just absolutely overwhelmed.'

'We have gone from not knowing where 
Atiya is to finding out that we do know where Atiya is, to receiving 
pictures of Atiya and how she looks now, to Atiya coming here and Atiya 
actually being here. It's just been an absolute whirlwind.'

Ms Wilkinson said she could not explain what it was like to see her daughter's face again and see 'what she is actually like'.

'It was very emotional. She is how I 
expected. She looks exactly the same as she did three years ago, she is 
just taller and a bit older.'

Ms Wilkinson said she did have a 'few 
fears' that Atiya would be unsettled with the change and the flight but 
added: 'She is absolutely fine. She is trying to communicate and she is 
playing with the things that we have bought for her. She's settled.'

Describing the moment they met again, 
she said: 'She had a big smile on her face. Atiya was told that I was 
mummy and she said "Mummy" and smiled.'

Miss Wilkinson had said ‘all her Christmases had come at once’ when she heard her daughter had been found in Pakistan.

Waiting: Tears from Gemma Wilkinson tonight at Manchester Airport awaiting the return of her daughter Atiya

Atiya was three when she was snatched
by Razwan Ali Anjum, 28, who had told Miss Wilkinson he was taking 
their daughter on a day trip to Southport, Merseyside – but instead flew
her 3,700 miles to his native Pakistan.

The former insurance salesman then 
returned to the UK without Atiya and told Miss Wilkinson she would never
see her daughter again. Anjum was jailed for refusing to reveal Atiya’s
whereabouts, with one judge saying it was the ‘most cruel’ form of 
abduction he had dealt with.

It is understood Atiya was traced on 
Christmas Eve and Anjum’s younger brother, Imran, flew out the same day 
to Pakistan. He escorted the youngster on the flight home and they 
arrived at Manchester Airport last night.

A
tearful Miss Wilkinson, speaking just hours before the reunion, said: 
‘I just want to give her a hug that lasts forever. She’s the best 
Christmas present I could ever, ever ask for. It’s going to be quite 
hard work for Atiya when she comes back but we’ve got all the support 
that she needs to be able to adapt to life back at home.’

She
added: ‘The last three years have been an absolute nightmare. The not 
knowing, imagining things and thinking about what could have happened. 
Nobody knew anything, or would say anything. I thought I was still 
dreaming when I woke up this morning, but this is real and she’s on her 
way home.’

The youngster, now six, was 
discovered in the town of Sialkot, Punjab, following a police appeal on 
November 6. On the eve of her sixth birthday, police issued a 
computer-generated photograph of what she was thought to look like now 
and a plea from her mother for anyone with information to get in touch. 
It emerged that Atiya had been living with Anjum’s relatives in the town
all along.

Police sources said the relatives 
agreed to co-operate with the Pakistani authorities after seeing that 
the girl’s mother was still appealing for her to be found three years 
on. Miss Wilkinson, a former charity worker, met Anjum in 2003 on a 
business college course and Atiya was born on November 7, 2006. She 
ended the relationship with Anjum, who she described as possessive and 
controlling, two years later.

Atiya’s
return followed the intervention of Sajjad Karim, an MEP for North West
England, who met Hina Rabbani Khar, Pakistan’s foreign minister, last 
month to discuss the case. He said: ‘The authorities in Pakistan have 
been absolutely crucial in delivering Atiya to us.

‘They
[the authorities] monitored the place where she was and eventually they
moved in and informed the people that she was living with, the extended
family of the father, that Atiya would have to be returned to the UK.

‘There wasn’t any resistance. Her passport was produced immediately upon their request.’Anjum
was jailed in June 2010 for failing to disclose Atiya’s whereabouts, 
but has subsequently been given three more jail terms.

A spokesman for Mr Karim’s office said Anjum was still in jail and had refused to co-operate  with police.

Detective Superintendent Phil Owen 
said: 'This has been a long and hard investigation which has thankfully 
culminated in Atiya being on her way home.

'Throughout
the three years of her disappearance, her mother Gemma has 
understandably been sick with worry. She had not heard from her beloved 
daughter and did not know whether she would ever set eyes upon her 
again.

'However, Gemma,
alongside ourselves and a variety of organisations, were determined we 
would not give up and remained dedicated to finding her. Thanks to this 
determination and the help from the Pakistani authorities, we have the 
outcome we were hoping for.'
