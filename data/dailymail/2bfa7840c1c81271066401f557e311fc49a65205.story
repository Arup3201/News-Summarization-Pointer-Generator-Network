Ambulance officers rushed Mr Friend to the Prince of Wales hospital in Randwick for emergency treatment.

It's been revealed that he collapsed due to chest trauma and internal bleeding which was caused at the NRL game just hours earlier.

The footballer will require surgery and blood transfusions.

His agent Steve Gillis told the Daily Telegraph that, 'Heâ€™s very grateful for the well wishers and all the people who helped him on the night, especially Paige and the staff at the hospital.'
