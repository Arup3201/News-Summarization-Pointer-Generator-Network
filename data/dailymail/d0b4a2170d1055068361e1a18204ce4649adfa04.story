Katie Price wearing the £9,000 engagement ring bought by soon-to-be-ex-husband, Keiran Hayler

She may be going through a public split after husband Kieran Hayner cheated with her best friend, but we know at least six huge sparkly reasons Katie Price need not mope.

A top jeweller has estimated that her engagement bling collection has doubled in value and is now worth almost £1 million.

Over the past past sixteen years, the 35-year-old has had a total of five broken marriages and engagements and the value of her collection of wedding and engagement rings has increased by £325,250.

The two rings bought by her first husband Peter Andre, who was her second fiance, have increased in value the most.

Andre's diamond-encrusted silver wedding ring has shot up from £350,000 when it was bought in 2005, to £600,000 today.

Andre's engagement ring takes up the
 entire first half of her finger and contains a 
multitude of diamonds.

Since splitting from Andre, she has
 had it crafted into a beautiful bangle which she plans to pass on to 
daughter Princess. The bangle, with all the ring's 
original diamonds, has been valued at £250,000.

Celebrity
 jeweller Vashi Dominguez, who compiled Katie's bling list, said: 'Katie
 has been very astute in her choice of rings - the price is definitely 
right for Pricey.

'She has shown 
surprisingly good taste in all her choices. If only she had similarly 
good judgement when it comes to men!'

Katie’s
 first engagement ring was a world away from her more recent extravagant
 tastes - a classic £3,500 diamond ring, bought for her in 1997 by body 
builder Waren Furman - better known as gladiator Ace.

They split shortly after the engagement, she had better luck with the ring which has increased in value and is now worth £6,000.

By
 the time her Peter Andre proposed six years later in 2004, (after 
the pair met on TV show I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here) Katie was the most famous woman
 in UK showbiz, and her £180,000 sparkler fitted in perfectly.

Katie, who has had the diamonds fashioned into a bangle, said: 'When I'm older Princess will get the bracelet with the diamonds I married her dad with. It has not gone to waste.'

After four years, the fairy-tale romance with Andre was over.

Vashi, who often appears on ITV's This Morning as a jewellery expert, said: 'The marriage may have 
ended in tears but Katie has done very well out of the rings.

'Tastes
 change very quickly but there is huge demand for this kind of bling 
jewellery, particularly with the economy in Britain doing so well and so
 much foreign money being invested here, especially in London. If 
Katie was ever to sell the rings, she would make a huge profit.'

The
 millionaire model then found love in 2009 with martial arts fighter 
Alex Reid, who was smitten within two weeks and popped the question in a
 matter of months.

Katie's ring from Alex Reid has shot up in value from £25,00 to £42,00

He 
presented his fiancée with a huge peach rock on a vast diamond-encrusted
 mount, valued then at £25,000 and now worth £42,000.

The couple went on to marry but by 2012 the love was gone.

She
then moved on to toyboy Leandro Penna who gave her a pink heart-shaped ring 
in 2012, costing £15,000 from Harrods - it is now worth £25,000.

But shortly after the engagagement she discovered that the ring had not been paid for and returned it to the store.

In January last year, Katie got engaged to stripper Kieran Hayner, nine years her junior.

The 26-year-old presented her with a more modest silver band worth of £9,000. 
The couple married later in the year and had son Jett Riviera 
together.

It was a more 
classic, less extravagant number, reflecting a slightly toned-down 
overall image for the mum-of-five. The ring is now worth £9,750.

Katie,
 now six months pregnant with Kieran’s second child, revealed last week 
that her husband has been cheating with her best friend Jane Pountney 
for the past seven months – and now plans to divorce him.

But we can't see Katie being left on the shelf, so no doubt the sixth engagement ring is still to come.

Originally Princess Diana's, Kate's ring consists of 14 solitaire diamonds surrounding a 12-carat oval blue Ceylon blue sapphire and set in white gold

Vashi, founder of online diamond and jewellery retailer Vashi.com, reckons Katie's next ring could be the biggest yet.

Vashi
 said: 'Katie Price is the poster girl for larger than life allure and 
she abhors subtlety - instead preferring over-the-top sexiness and 
sparkle. Bling should be her middle name. I can’t see her ever being 
content with a tiny traditional engagement ring!'

Katie's not the only famous face whose finger candy has shot up in value.

Undoubtedly the most famous engagement ring in the world, Kate Middleton's sapphire sparkler has increased more than ten-fold.

The piece of jewellery consists of 14 solitaire diamonds surrounding a 12-carat oval blue Ceylon sapphire set in 18-karat white gold. It was originally the engagement ring of the late Princess Diana and was worth £28,000 when it was bought in 1981, but is now valued at £300,000.

The stunning sparkler sits at the top of a list of the 20 famous rings, placed in order of how much each has appreciated in value since they were first given. 

Kate's engagement ring, seen here as she cradled Prince George during the royal tour of of Australia, has increased in value 10 times since it was given to Princess Diana more than 30 years ago

Kate’s ring is now worth three times more than the Queen's engagement ring.

The Queen's modest engagement token, presented by Prince Phillip in 1947, has increased in value from £10,000 to £100,000 today and comes second on the list.

A 3-carat diamond solitaire is flanked on each side by five smaller diamonds, all set in platinum. The diamonds were taken from a tiara owned by Prince Phillip’s mother, adding a sweet heritage touch.

The Duchess of Cornwall's band - a beautiful 1930s Art Deco design - was the most expensive of the royal betrothal rings at its purchase, up from £100,000 at the time of her wedding to Prince Charles in 2004 to £250,000 now.

Vashi Dominguez, jewellery expert on ITV's This Morning, who compiled the list, said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge’s ring has appreciated more quickly than any other ring in the list.

'It’s Kate’s style icon status that makes the ring so special.

'Symbolically, blue can convey a sense of trust, loyalty and understanding, which is perfectly in tune with the giving of an engagement ring.

Jay Z gave Beyoncé a ring worth $5 million. The flawless diamond is a dream at 18cts and is set in platinum

'Blue is also a colour associated with the royals, of course.'

Third
 on the list is Michelle Obama's engagement ring - presented to her by 
Barack Obama in 1991, when he was an unknown lawyer. It was a worth a 
modest £7,500 then and its current value is estimated at £20,000.

Its actual value is tiny compared to Beyoncé's engagement ring, which was worth £2,650,000 when rapper Jay-Z proposed in 2007.

Victoria's 3-carat ring has more than doubled its £100,000 value since David proposed in 1998 (left); while Angelina's bespoke ring has increased in value over to £300,000 since her engagement in 2012 (right)

The statement piece, an 18-carat diamond set in platinum, is now worth £5,800,000 but only comes 11th on the list.

Kim
 Kardashian's 15-carat bling is the second most expensive on the list, 
priced at £5,150,000, and is ranked fifth in terms of its appreciation 
in value.

David
 and Victoria Beckham's rings' original value was £100,000 each back in 
1998 - the rings have now individually shot up in worth to £230,000 
each.

Victoria's 3-carat pride of joy is marquise cut; an unusual, elegant diamond shape, while David's matching band is set with 96 exquisite diamonds. They rank as joint sixth on the list.

'Even in 1998, Victoria’s ring was unusual and perhaps ahead of its time,' said Vashi.

'It was perhaps a sign that she would turn to fashion and become greatly successful in the industry.'

Prime Minister's wife Samantha Cameron's engagement ring is estimated to have been worth £25,000 when it was given to her ahead of their 1994 wedding. It is now worth £45,000 and comes seventh on the list.

Vashi 
said: 'Samantha Cameron rarely shows off her engagement ring, so it's a 
treat when we see pictures of it. Samantha appears to save the ring for 
special occasions rather than wear it every day.'

Angelina
 Jolie's 2012 engagement ring, designed by her fiance Brad Pitt, 
features diamonds of the highest quality cut to a size and shape to suit
 the screen beauty's slender hand. It originally cost £600,000, is now 
worth £950,000 and comes 12th on the list.

Vashi
 added: 'All the rings are gorgeous and, despite many of them being 
extremely expensive, they all represent something deeply personal. It's 
essentially about the bride-to-be's emotional connection, hence why the 
rings become precious heirlooms, passed down through generations - a 
tradition so beautifully upheld by the Royal Family.

'No one buys an engagement ring as an investment but the steep rise in their valuations, particularly in recent years as we emerge from the recession and the demand for luxury jewellery increases, shows what a sound investment diamonds are.'
