She was not seen on an official public engagement for almost two months while she battled with extreme morning sickness.

But the Duchess of Cambridge, who is 15 weeks pregnant, looked the picture of heath as she showed off her baby bump during a tour of an oil refinery in Wales.

Wearing a light blue Matthew Williamson coat and heeled black boots, she joked and laughed with well-wishers outside the Valero Pembroke Refinery on the Pembrokeshire coast.

Kate was not seen at a public engagement for several weeks after her pregnancy was announced at the start of September.

It was revealed that she had been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes extreme vomiting and dehydration.

The Duchess also battled with this condition while she was pregnant with Prince George and she was admitted to hospital to receive treatment.

She returned to royal duties last month as part of the state visit by the president of Singapore.

The royal couple met with oil refinery workers and apprentices during the visit earlier today

The oil refinery which is celebrating its 50th anniversary said the royal couple's visit was a 'huge honour'

It has been announced that the Duchess is expected to give birth in April. 

For the first few years of their marriage, William and Kate lived a secluded four-bedroom cottage in Anglesey on the north west coast of Wales. 

The oil refinery which is celebrating its 50th anniversary said their  visit was a 'huge honour'. 

The royal couple met with workers and apprentices and looked at a  display celebrating the last 50 years.

They were ushered into a minibus to travel to the 1,270-acre site's control room where they met shipping and blending workers.

'Nicely spruced up for our arrival,' William joked as they entered the room. 'I can smell the paint.'

Both William and Kate sat in front of screens and pressed a button to create their own gasoline blend. 'Shall I do one and you can do the other one?' Kate told William.

The Pembroke refinery was officially opened in 1964 by the Queen Mother and employs 1,200 people

After she pressed the button William laughingly told workers: 'We are waiting for the red light to go off.'

The group clapped loudly after William had also pressed his button and told the couple it would take 15 hours to create the blend. William replied: 'We will do the night shift.'

He asked whether anyone would be watching the rugby match later, which the royal couple will attend. 'I am sure one of these (monitors) can be turned into a big screen,' he told them.

Valero vice president and refinery general manager Ed Tomp said it was a recognition of the role the plant 'continues to play supporting our economy and communities here in west Wales.'

'I know the entire community is looking forward to welcoming the duke and duchess to the refinery, which looks set to be a wonderful opportunity for everyone in Pembrokeshire to celebrate.'

The couple laughed and joked with the refinery workers as they posed outside in the blustery conditions

The Pembroke refinery was officially opened in 1964 by the Queen Mother and employs 1,200 people.

Built in a deep natural harbour at Rhoscrowther, it processes 270,000 barrels a day, has a pipeline stretching as far as Manchester and supplies more than 10% of the UK's fuel. 

The couple will now travel by helicopter to Cardiff to watch the rugby union match between Wales and Australia.

William, vice patron of the Welsh Rugby Union, will attend the match at the Millennium Stadium, accompanied by Kate.

The match will begin with a Remembrance tribute and both William and Kate were wearing red poppies today.

The Duchess looked relaxed as she arrived at the Millennium Stadium ahead of the rugby match on Saturday

During half-time the pair will privately meet injured servicemen in the President's Box. William will also visit injured players and their families at a reception after the match. 

Meanwhile, Prince Harry braved the wet weather in London to attend the international rugby union test match between England and New Zealand at Twickenham. 

The Prince, who wore a poppy pinned to his lapel, kept a close eye on the action as he watched the home side narrowly lose to their opponents. 

And at half time, the Prince met with guests at meeting for the RFU Injured Players Foundation, of which he is a patron.
