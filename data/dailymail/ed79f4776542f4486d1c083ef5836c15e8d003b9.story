Neymar may only be 23-years-old, but the Brazilian sensation is in line to make his 300th club appearance in Barcelona's league match with Eibar on Saturday.

The Barca forward will return from his one-game ban for picking up five cautions this season to 'complete the trident' alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, enthuses Mundo Deportivo.

Neymar has played 225 games for Santos and 74 for the Catalan side - who face a potentially season defining period in the coming week with a Champions League decider against Manchester City on Wednesday and El Clasico next Sunday.

The club, Josep Bartomeu and Sandro Rosell are also set to appear in court over alleged tax offences with Barca insisting they will appeal the charge.

Elsewhere in Spain, all attention has been consumed by the enduring 'crisis' at the Bernabeu where Real Madrid are only a point off the pace in La Liga after having stuttered into the quarter finals of the Champions League.

Marca insists 'Another Madrid Is Possible' before listing 10 ways that Los Blancos can get their season back on track, including changing the system and the return of former Tottenham playmaker Luka Modric to restore fluidity to the midfield.

However, AS believes it is red card-prone defender Sergio Ramos who can 'come to the rescue' by returning to face Levante in preparation for next week's showdown at the Nou Camp.

Meanwhile, in Italy Paris Saint Germain's heroic victory over Chelsea to reach the Champions League quarter finals has seen pint sized playmaker Marco Verratti hailed as 'The Best Player in Italy' by Gazetta dello Sport.

The Argentine forward Dybala has also been linked with a summer move to Manchester United

The 22-year-old has been largely overlooked by the national team, although the paper run what appears to be a request to manager Antonio Conte, saying: ‘Dear Conte, I am ready to play like Pirlo... I know that I can give a lot for the Azzurri in front of the defence. Jose Mourinho remains a great, but we got such sweet revenge!’.

Conte's former club side Juventus face Palermo this weekend with current manager Massimiliano Allegri warning his side not to become preoccupied by next week's European return leg against Borussia Dortmund - where the Italians carry a 2-1 advantage to Germany.

Corriere dello Sport also claim that the Old Lady will be casting her eye over Palermo forward Paulo Dybala who has also been linked with Manchester United.
