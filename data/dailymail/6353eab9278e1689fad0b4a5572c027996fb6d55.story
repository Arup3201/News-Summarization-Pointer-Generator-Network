On the attack: Best-selling author Zadie Smith has branded those who claim she is too beautiful to be a writer 'misogynists'

Best selling author Zadie Smith has attacked ‘misogynists’ who claim she is too beautiful to be a great writer.

During an interview on today’s episode of Desert Island Discs, Ms Smith condemns the media’s ‘ridiculous’ obsession with her looks and the implicit and ‘sinister’ suggestion that a beautiful woman cannot achieve literary greatness.

The 37-year-old, who finished her award-winning debut novel White Teeth during her final year at Cambridge University, said: ‘People seem to think I put those photos in the paper. I don’t put them in.

Photo editors put my photo in because it’s the easiest thing to do, I suppose.’

She added: ‘Some of it is just ridiculous. A friend was telling me that in an Italian newspaper they had an editorial letter about how I was probably quite a good writer.

‘But I couldn’t possibly be a great writer because, in their opinion, I was too attractive and when you thought about writers those things never went together.’

Ms Smith went on to cite Sylvia Plath as an example of a beautiful female author before addressing ‘sinister’ sexist attitudes.

She said: ‘What is fascinating about it is what it assumes.

‘It is a really misogynistic and fascinating thought. Because what it means is that if you are beautiful, then you have no need to be intelligent – it is a very sinister thought actually.’

Desert Island Discs will be on BBC Radio 4 today at 11.15am.
