When a French politician remarked that a monument should be raised in honour of American independence at a dinner party in 1865 he probably didn't imagine that the result would become an international icon of freedom.

Édouard René de Laboulaye was an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War and was thrilled when they triumphed over the Confederacy in 1865 marking an end to slavery.

During a conversation at his home in Versailles Laboulaye was heard to say: 'If a monument should rise in the United States, as a memorial to their independence, I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort—a common work of both our nations.'

He may not have meant the comment as a proposal but it was nevertheless overhead by fellow guest and sculptor Frédéric
Bartholdi who agreed that such a project would be a suitable joint 
venture for the France and America to undertake together.

Bartholdi set about designing the 
Statue of Liberty - an neoclassical sculpture of the Roman god of 
freedom - but due to the troubled political situation in France work did
not commence until the 1870s.

The sculptor had already begun work on 
the statue's head and torch-bearing arm when on March 3, 1877, President
Grant finally signed a joint resolution that authorised the President 
to accept the statue when it was presented by France.

The resolution stated that France would provide 
the statue and America the pedestal. The location for the statue was confirmed to 
be Bedloe's Island (later Liberty Island) just outside Manhattan.

Having got confirmation from America 
Bartholdi returned to Paris and completed the head which was exhibited 
at the Paris World Fair the following year.

In 1885 she was finally disassembled 
and shipped to New York and a ceremony of dedication was held on the 
afternoon of October 28, 1886 where Bartholdi's hard work was celebrated
by a parade watched by hundreds of thousands of Americans.

The statue has been an important symbol of freedom and liberty for America and her allies ever since.

Library, document the statue's construction during her years in Paris between 
1877 and 1885.
