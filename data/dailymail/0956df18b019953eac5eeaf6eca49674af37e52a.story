The theft of an iPhone began a campaign of bullying that led to the death of a teenage New Yorker and his former best friend charged with his murder.

On Wednesday, 14-year-old Noel
 Estevez allegedly used a kitchen knife to stab Timothy 
Crump, also 14, in the chest three times after school in the Bronx, New York.

The two teenagers had been close friends spending their spare time together skateboarding, sharing dirty jokes on Facebook and playing computer games.

Noel Estevez, 14, has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over the death of his former friend, Timothy Crump

Friends and neighbours say that Timothy accused Estevez of stealing his smartphone and that started a campaign of harassment and bullying that resulted in Estevez trying to kill himself.

Estevez's hair was hacked, his sexuality questioned and he was teased over his mother's arrest for drug dealing.

Estevez, who friends said suffered
from a speech impediment and Tourette’s syndrome, was terrified of Timothy and a group of his friends who took to urinating up the front door of the Estevez home, chasing him down the 
street and leaving him too scared to leave his home.

Around 3pm on Wednesday, as Intermediate School 117 on Morris Avenue was being let out the argument between Estevez and Timothy Crump spilled over into bloodshed.

Witnesses said that they saw Timothy confront Estevez as they left school, before punching him and kneeing him in the nose.

Teachers and teaching assistants rushed to the scene to break up the brawl but before they could intervene, Estevez produced a 12-inch kitchen knife and plunged it into his former friend three times.

Timothy was rushed to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Estevez has been charged as an adult with second degree murder and second degree manslaughter.

Noel Estevez tried to hang himself in his own apartment on May 28. His father found him in the closet with a rope

Chailyn Oballe, 12, said that she was leaving classes for the day when she saw a group huddling outside the school.

'And
 that's when I saw the boy with the knife,' she said. 'He looked like
 he was about to stab somebody else and then he put the knife in his 
pocket and covered it with his shirt.'

Differing accounts have been given about the boys' relationship.One has it that Estevez had long been bullied by Timothy Crump. Another that they were all part of the same gang but had fallen out.

'He
 used to be part of their group, but I think they threw him out and they
 started teasing him,' Jorge Guerrero, 47, the porter at the Estevez building on East Clarke Place in High Bridge, said.

He said that on at least four occasions in the last month he had to mop up urine from outside the apartment.

He added that he did not recognise Crump as one of the bullies - but others did.

'Timothy is one of the kids that is constantly bullying Noel,' Estevez’s neighbour Stephany Arroyo, 23, said. '[He
 would say] things like, "Ha ha, your mum's a crackhead, you're 
stuttering, you don't got no food stamps, you're mum’s locked up.'

Another family friend Marisol Perez said it was worse than that.

‘They would move their bowels in front of the door, try and set the door on fire,’ she said. ‘Every time the cops would come, the kids would leave, saying there was nothing they could do about it.'

Mrs Estevez and Miss Perez were arrested on June 11 for allegedly selling drugs to an undercover policeman. Both declare their innocence.

Charged: Estevez can be seen centre being taken in for questioning on Wednesday night. He has now been charged with second-degree murder and charged as an adult, police said

Miss Arroyo said that Timothy 'found it funny'. She said that he and his friends would hang outside Estevez's building, threatening him.

The treatment eventually left Estevez suicidal, Marisol Perez, said.

'Two
 weeks ago on May 28 he tried to hang himself in his own apartment,' Miss Perez added. 'His 
father found him hanging himself in the closet with a rope.'

Estevez
 was recently released from the hospital and returned to school this 
week, even though he told his father he did not want to go because of the
 bullies.

'His father brought him to school this morning and said, "Don’t worry, just go straight home after school",' Miss Perez added.

But Timothy Crump's neighbours at a homeless shelter said that he was a quiet child and that Estevez was the bully.

'He
 wanted to make it look like he was the victim,' Tyrone Rivers said. 
'He'd say, "I run this block, I’m going to get my gun and shoot you." 
I’ve seen him say it.'

A policeman said that Estevez had borrowed Timothy’s mobile, but was unable to return it. Timothy is believed to have asked for the phone’s return or financial compensation.

Yesterday, Estevez appeared at a Bronx courthouse. His father, Felix, was not present at the court because, said defence lawyer Eric Poulos, he had been threatened by Timothy’s family, although his aunts and cousins did attend.

The hearing lasted around 10 minutes and Mr Poulos described months of harassment and intimidation suffered by his client.

The family had repeatedly sought help from the authorities, to little avail, he said.

Judge Laurence Busching ordered Estevez to be held without bail and scheduled the next hearing for Tuesday.
