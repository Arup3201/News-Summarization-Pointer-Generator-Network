A motorcyclist who filmed himself careering off 'Britain's most dangerous road' at 60mph has been found guilty of dangerous driving after police spotted the video on YouTube.

The shocking footage shows then 21-year-old Jack Sanderson flying off his bike and down a 40ft ridge as he swerved to avoid a car on the notorious Cat and Fiddle road in Macclesfield.

Somehow Sanderson escaped with only minor injuries, despite the clip showing him repeatedly somersaulting down a hill.

Near miss: Jack Sanderson, 21, just escaped crashing head-on into a car before flying down a steep bank

Ditched: The helmet camera shows Sanderson lying at the bottom of the ridge, somehow uninjured

The A537 Buxton New Road is known as the Cat and Fiddle road as it is home to a pub of the same name. It has repeatedly been branded Britain's most dangerous due to its sharp bends and steep drops - between 2007 and 2011 there were 44 fatal or serious accidents on the road. 

Sanderson posted the video of his crash on YouTube in order to 'warn other riders' about the dangers of the road, but it became such a hit that it drew the attention of police, who decided to prosecute.

The video has racked up more than 100,000 views, and shows Sanderson overtaking two bikes before veering into the wrong lane and coming within inches of colliding with a car on a corner.

He then flies off into a field and is thrown from his 600cc Kawasaki Ninja, with the whole incident filmed by a camera on his helmet.

The dazed Sanderson is then seen getting to his feet, dusting himself down and clambering back up the hill to greet concerned onlookers who had stopped to help.

His only wound was a cut hand - which he received when he grabbed hold of some barbed wire as he walked away from the crash. 

Sanderson, an engineer from Mobberley, Cheshire, said: 'I can't believe I walked out of that, not even with a broken bone.

'When I went over the ridge I was like helicopter spinning. I thought, this is it. I'm a goner. My bike stayed at the top of the ridge and I continued down.

Warning shot: Sanderson shared the video as a warning to other bikers, but his plan has now backfired

'If my bike had followed me and crushed me, I would not be standing here today.' 

Sanderson was found guilty at a hearing at Macclesfield Magistrates Court and will be sentenced later this month. He has been banned from driving any vehicle in the meantime. 

The bike, which stopped at the top of the ridge, was written off and has been sold for parts.  

Because of its winding nature, the Cat and Fiddle road draws a large racing crowd, and is particularly popular with motorcyclists.

In the 12 Road Safety Foundation charity reports since 2002, it has been come top of the list of most dangerous roads in eight. 

At 1,680ft it is also one of the highest roads in England.
