Rolf Harris groped Vanessa Feltz live on television in front of his wife, it emerged yesterday.

The broadcaster spoke out for the first time to reveal how the sex predator tugged at her underwear during an interview on a breakfast show.

She said she only managed to stop him intimately assaulting her by calling out for an advertisement break.

'Staggering': Vanessa Feltz revealed she spoke to police about how Harris moved his hand up her leg while they were filming a sequence together on a bed for Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast

Singer Linda Nolan has also revealed that she too fell victim to the paedophile, who molested her when she was 15.

The
 celebrities were among 15 new alleged victims who have come forward in 
Britain, Australia and New Zealand claiming abuse by Harris, which could
 lead to fresh police investigations.

Harris,
 84, was jailed for five years and nine months at Southwark Crown Court 
on Friday for 12 indecent assaults on four victims including a child as 
young as eight and his daughter’s best friend.

Feltz, 52, contacted Scotland Yard on the first day of the trial hoping
 to testify against him, but his lawyers said the allegations came too 
late to investigate without derailing the case.

The
 Daily Mail reported last week that a celebrity had been assaulted live 
on television but was unable to identify Feltz because she wanted 
to remain anonymous at the time.

But yesterday she broke her silence to encourage other victims to speak out.

The attack happened in May 1996 on Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast, part of which involved a celebrity being interviewed on a bed.

Feltz said some of the make-up girls warned her that Harris was known 
in the business for his wandering hands but she did not believe them.

The
 presenter, who was wearing a floor-length evening dress, added: ‘As the
 interview continued, with his wife watching and with the crew all in 
the room, I suddenly felt a rustling at the hem of my dress.

‘I
 was on live television so I could not look down but I sensed that his 
hand was at the bottom of my dress and he was slowly gathering the 
fabric up and moving his hand higher and higher up my leg.’

She said Harris carried on smiling and joking as though nothing was happening.

‘Suddenly
 his hand had reached my knee and he was still going up and travelling 
at speed,’ she told the Sunday Express. ‘After a few seconds he had 
managed to get his hand inside the elastic of my knickers and I was 
absolutely staggered.

‘I had
 to do something but I was in the middle of an interview on live 
television with one of the most famous men in the country. I have not a 
shadow of a doubt that he knew exactly what he was doing and he was 
getting excited about it, doing what he was doing while he was on live 
television.

‘I realised that
 if I did not do something dramatic I would be literally a sitting 
target. I had no alternative but to cut to an advert break.

‘The
 second we went to the break I jumped away from him and got his hand out
 from under my dress. He didn’t react in any way at all. When we came 
back to the live interview he carried on as if nothing had happened.

Days gone by: Linda Nolan (far left, in 1978) has claimed she was a 15-year-old girl supporting Harris on a six-week tour with her singing sisters in Johannesburg when he launched a backstage attack in 1975

‘I was powerless to protect myself and he knew and he was getting a thrill from it.

‘After
 the interview I rushed off to the dressing room without speaking to 
him. At the time I did not even consider going to the police. I did not 
think anyone would believe me against the great Rolf Harris.’

Linda
 Nolan said Harris pounced on her backstage while she was on tour in 
South Africa with her sisters in 1975. She was 15 at the time and was 
wearing only a dressing gown.

‘He
 came out of nowhere and in seconds his hands were all over me,’ she 
told the Sunday Mirror. ‘He rubbed up and down and started kissing and 
licking the back of my neck. It was horrible.

‘I
 whispered to him, “Please don’t Rolf, please, please stop”. He did stop
 then, but looked at me like I was an idiot. He laughed it off and said,
 “Don’t be silly, I’m only giving you a hug”.’

Art galleries, museums, universities and even a cockle stall in Swansea have been cutting their ties with once-loved entertainer Rolf Harris after he was jailed for sex offences.

And the owner of a portrait of rock singer Bonnie Tyler - which Harris painted in 1977 - once valued at £50,000, is now thinking of burning it after being told his art’s value has sunk by 90 per cent.

In Merthyr Tydfil, Cyfarthfa Castle's Museum and Art Gallery officials have been ‘editing out’ his name from the plaque put in place in 2011 when he re-opened it after a £320,000 refurbishment.

However, an 1877 photograph of the town taken by Harris's grandfather George Frederick Harris, which is in the museum's entrance hall, will remain in place as it was not the paedophile’s work.

In Aberystwyth, The National Library of Wales says it has ‘no plans’ to display the Harris painting Korean Monk, completed in 2007 and donated to the institution in the same year.

The painting was donated at an event celebrating Harris's family ties to Wales, with his parents Cromwell and Agnes Harris leaving the town of Merthyr Tydfil for Australia before his birth.

Dr Paul Joyner, a curator at the library, said of Korean Monk: ‘We haven't got any plans to display it, and considering the situation at the moment we'd be less likely to be drawing attention to it.’

At Swansea Market, Carol Watts, 52, the owner of Carol Watts Gower Cockles and Shellfish, has taken down large newspaper photos at her market stall of Harris painting her portrait in 2012.

Harris was filming for a BBC Wales programme about Swansea artist Evan Walters. Mrs Watts donned a 150-year-old shawl owned by her great-grandmother Margaret Phillips for the sitting.

She has kept one small photo of the finished painting up at her stall as a reminder of the day, but said: ‘I took down a set of big photos of the event on the first week of the trial.’

Mother-of-one Cathy Sims, 43, of King's Lynn, Norfolk, is the owner of the 1970s Harris oil painting of Bonnie Tyler - who received the artwork from her father.

When she took it onto the Antiques Roadshow in 2011, presenter Philip Mould valued it at ‘up to £50,000’, explaining that after Harris had painted the Queen, his values had risen substantially.

She tried to sell the picture two years ago at Barry Hawkins Auctioneers in Norfolk but despite bids going up to £26,000 it failed to reach the reserve.

Taken away: Harris has been stripped of an honorary degree he received from Liverpool Hope University

Ms Sims said that after Harris was found guilty she was considering burning the painting.

She said: ‘It's very weird. I don't know what to do with it. But it's a horrific reminder of what Rolf Harris has done. I have a lot of empathy for the victims.

‘Now all I see when I look at that picture is an innocent-looking sad young girl and all I can think about is what he has been convicted of.

‘I don't want to keep something like that in my house, but it's no longer valuable to anyone. Unless I burn it, I don't know what to do.’

Harris has also been stripped of an honorary degree he received from Liverpool Hope University.
