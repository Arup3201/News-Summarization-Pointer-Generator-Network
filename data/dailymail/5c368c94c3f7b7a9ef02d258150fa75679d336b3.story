Violent: 32-year-old Emma Griffiths screamed and tried to bite the police officers who came to her rescue after she crashed her car

A drunken mother who launched an attack on police officers trying to rescue her from a horror smash has been jailed for six months.

Beautician Emma Griffiths was already serving a three-year ban for drink-driving when she sped off after realising she had been spotted by a police car driving erratically.

But the mother of two did not get very far in her bid to escape with her car clipping a kerb and careering through the air smashing into a phone box moments later.

Fearing the worst, officers rushed to help her but the 32-year-old had managed to climb out of the wreckage through the driver’s window leaving another woman trapped inside.

But instead of going to her friend’s aid she began ‘screaming and shouting’ launching a vicious attack on the officers who ran over to help the pair.

Griffiths attacked and threatened the officers with a metal bar and even tried to bite one of them on the backside.

Prosecutor Kerry Bell said that while officers were trying to rescue Griffiths, she had to be taken to the ground screaming and shouting incoherently.

During a struggle Griffiths picked up a metal bar - part of the demolished phone box - and waved it about.

Mrs Bell said: ‘Later she managed to slip out of one of her handcuffs and attempted to bite an officer on the bottom and scratched his colleague on both wrists.’

Griffiths’ drunken confrontation took place as her smashed car lay on its side smouldering and leaking fluids with a 24-year-old passenger still trapped inside.

District Judge Duncan Birrell said: ‘It’s nothing short of miraculous that you and your passenger were not killed. In my estimation you were driving at high speed and incapable of controlling the car.’

Wreckage: Ms Griffiths had sped off from police before clipping a kerb and smashing into a phone box. She attacked police while her passenger was stuck in the car and her car was smouldering

Jailing her for six months at Manchester Magistrates court, he added: ‘The way you treated the police trying to help you was disgraceful and I would be failing in my public duty if I didn’t send you to prison.’

Griffiths had driven off at high speed in her black Citroen after spotting police in the early hours of June 19.

During the chase the car somersaulted through a garden fence and ended up on its side in the driveway of a house in Openshaw, Greater Manchester.

Griffiths, of West Bank, Openshaw, admitted charges of driving one-and-a-half times over the limit, police assault, careless driving, driving while banned and no insurance.

Record: Manchester Magistrates Court heard that Ms Griffiths was serving a three-year ban for drink driving when the crash happened

Disqualifying her for five years, Judge Birrell said: ‘You need to address whatever problems you have - you were very dangerous that night.’ The passenger was freed and treated by paramedics and both were taken to hospital for check-ups.

Phillip Reed, defending, said Griffiths who had a significant history of failing to comply with court orders, only had a limited recollection of what happened.

He said: ‘She is remorseful but I would be wasting my breath and the court’s time if I tried to argue against a custodial sentence.’
