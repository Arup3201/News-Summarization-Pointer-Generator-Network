An exhibitionist South Carolina couple who were arrested last month after they were caught having sex in a display shed at a Home Depot have been convicted, although only one will be serving jail time.

Emily Craig, 20 and Shaun Bowden, 31, were arrested in various states of undress by police after concerned members of the public phoned 911 at 8.40 a.m. to the North Charleston store on August 28th.

A police spokesman said that officers were dispatched 'in reference to a male and female entering a display shed on the property, closing the door behind themselves and remaining inside.'

When police arrived to the outdoor display shed they noted that Craig was 'partially clothed: the top of her dress was untied, hanging at her waist.'

Bowden had no shirt on and 'had his pants down near his knees'. He was found to have his penis exposed.

During a court hearing last Thursday, Craig pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and providing a false name to police.

She was sentenced to time served, the 22 days she spent in custody following her arrest.

Bowden, who did not show up in court, was tried in absentia and found guilty of disorderly conduct and indecent exposure.

Bowden was also sentenced a concurrent 30-day jail sentence.

The judge revoked his $400 bond and issued a bench warrant for his immediate arrest.

The excitable couple were arrested for disorderly conduct and Bowden was also given an indecent exposure count for, 'having his genitals within public view.'

Police and court records do not indicate why the pair chose home Home Depot for their early-morning assignation.

Craig lives about four miles from the store, while Bowdenâ€™s home is eight miles away from the retailer.
