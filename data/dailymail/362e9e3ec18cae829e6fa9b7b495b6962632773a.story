An effigy of Alex Salmond was set alight at a bonfire parade last night - despite claims it had been blocked by police - and EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso is next.

Proposals to burn the Scottish First Minister in Lewes, East Sussex, sparked outrage and a complaint was made to police - but pictures emerged online today showing one of the models at the centre of a fireworks display. 

One effigy had the politician standing at 16ft tall and holding a sign reading '45%', which refers to the proportion of Scottish people who voted for independence from the UK in September, while the Loch Ness Monster peers over his shoulder.

The effigy of Alex Salmond was set alight at a bonfire parade in Lewes, East Sussex, last night despite claims it had been blocked

Proposals to burn the Scottish First Minister in Lewes, East Sussex, sparked outrage and a complaint was made to police - but pictures emerged online today showing one of the models at the centre of a fireworks display

Images that appeared on social media appeared to show the effigy go up in flames as fireworks went off at the display in East Sussex

The second model portrayed a topless Mr Salmond wearing a kilt and sitting on a bucket of North Sea oil.

A number of societies take part in the parade, each providing their own effigies, costumes, bonfire sites and procession route within the town. 

The caricatures of Mr Salmon were made by the Waterloo Bonfire Society, which said it had 'no wish or intention to offend'.

Sussex Police said last night that complaints had been raised and tweeted: 'For those enquiring we have been advised that there won't be any burning of the Alex Salmond effigies this evening in Lewes.'

However, tweets from Michael Story posted at the end of the parade appeared to show the kilt-wearing effigy exploding in a puff of black smoke amid a fireworks display.

Mr Story wrote: 'To be absolutely clear: tonight I saw an effigy of Alex Salmond lit by fireworks then blown up at Lewes.'

Sussex Police is looking at a number of complaints about the portrayal of Mr Salmond as an effigy and is 'trying to establish whether or not any crime may have been committed'.

A spokeswoman for the force added: 'Officers spoke to the bonfire societies on the night to make them aware of the concerns being raised about the effigies of the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond.

'It was left up to the societies to make a decision about what they did with the effigies.'

High-profile politicians and celebrities have been targets of the parade in the past.

Television presenter and journalist Piers Morgan tried to soften the blow by tweeting: 'Don't take this Lewes bonfire thing too personally @AlexSalmond - they burned me too.'

Mr Salmond said: 'I'm in pretty good company - Angela Merkel got the burning treatment from the East Sussex Conservative council.

'I think their judgment is askew but if they think I'm a threat to the Westminster establishment like Guy Fawkes, they are right.

'I am used to insults from Tories in East Sussex and if they think that is a good thing to do it is up to them.'

He added that he was more concerned about Nessie being burned and said it that was 'totally outrageous'.

The effigy of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso is due to be burnt in Edenbridge, Kent, on Saturday as part of the bonfire celebrations

Bonfire Night in Lewes does not only commemorate the Gunpowder Plot, but also other events including the burning of 17 Protestant martyrs in the town's High Street from 1555 to 1557 under the reign of Mary Tudor. 

The local authority posted an image of the effigy from their official Twitter account, depicting the politician holding a 45 per cent panel in a jibe over the referendum result.

The tweet read: 'A sneak preview of Alex Salmond and Nessie ahead of tonight's bonfire in Lewes - it just rolled up at County Hall.'

The bonfire night celebrations in Lewes, East Sussex, are thought to be the largest in the world, where a variety of societies parade through the streets.

In previous years the town has burned controversial figures ranging from terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Popes and the German chancellor Angela Merkel.

Meanwhile in Edenbridge, Kent, this year's 'celebrity guy' has been unveiled as the former European Commission President ahead of bonfire celebrations on Saturday.

Another effigy of the Scottish First Minister sparked outrage yesterday afternoon as it was carried through the streets of Lewes, East Sussex

The Edenbridge Bonfire Society has been poking fun at the famous for nearly 20 years by building and exploding a 10 metre tall effigy alongside their traditional figure of Guy Fawkes. 

Bonfire society member Jon Mitchell said the decision came down to Mr Barroso's demand that Britain pay an extra £1.7 billion to the European Union.

He said: 'We do try very hard to pick somebody who's absolutely current in the news.

'We only made the decision on Tuesday of last week and we started building Jose on the Thursday.'

Speculation as to who this year's guys would be began when William Hill named Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson as the favourite.

But Mr Mitchell said other public opinion polls pointed towards Scottish National Party Leader Alex Salmond - who was the planned effigy in Sussex - and Katie Hopkins, a former contestant on The Apprentice, whose effigy was burnt by the Kent-based society last year.

Mr Mitchell said: 'It was a difficult one to decide as there was no clear favourite. We eliminated people one by one and were left with Jose.

'There were a lot of people who wanted us to burn Katie Hopkins again but she's put all that weight on so building her would have been a lot of extra work.'  

This year the focus was placed on the First Minister and Scotland's mysterious and much-loved national treasure, Nessie

The Edenbridge society's famous faces  have included Tony and Cherie Blair, Gordon Brown, Edwina Currie, John Prescott, Mario Balotelli, Wayne Rooney, Lance Armstrong, Russell Brand, Katie Price, Jacques Chirac and even Saddam Hussein.

But this year the focus for Lewes - in England - was placed on the First Minister and Scotland's mysterious and much-loved national treasure, Nessie.

The mock-up was set up by one of the town's groups, the Waterloo Bonfire Society, which is celebrating its 50th year after being formed in 1964.

But furious Scots took to social media to vent their anger at what they believed was an attack on everyone who voted in favour of independence.

Cybernat Wings Over Scotland tweeted: 'In fairness, Salmond WAS attempting through democratic means something akin to what Guy Fawkes tried with gunpowder.

'But still it's just hilarious to imagine the reaction if it was the other way round.'

Mhairi Hunter tweeted: 'Let's imagine for one second what would happen if an SNP-run Council burned an effigy of David Cameron. Lordy'

User JordMclean85 tweeted: 'What did poor Nessie do to deserve this though?'

An East Sussex County Council worker, who did not give his name, said: 'Well this actually happens every year and it happens to political figures and people who have in the news.

'I wouldn't read into it as it happens every year.'

On Saturday, Carlisle City council doused its plans to burn an effigy of Mary, Queen of Scots on a mock-up of Carlisle Castle where she was imprisoned, after it sparked outrage.

Several councillors complained and member of the public branded the idea insensitive and disrespectful so soon after the referendum bid.

When asked for comment, a spokesman for East Sussex Council Council said: 'The image was just a shot as something unusual passed the building and it has no connection to us at all.

'It is owned by Waterloo Bonfire Society and has no connection to the council whatsoever.'

East Sussex County Council later removed the photo from Twitter and posted a response saying: 'Please note that the Alex Salmond and Nessie models were created by Waterloo Bonfire Society #LewesBonfire and have NO connection to ESCC.'

A spokesman for Alex Salmond's constituency office said: 'It's not our place to comment on it.'

A spokesman for the First Minister said: 'The Tory-controlled East Sussex County Council obviously view the First Minister - and the 45 per cent of Scots who voted Yes - as big a threat to the Westminster establishment as Guy Fawkes, although it's unclear why poor Nessie has been targeted.

Juniors start off the evening's Tar Barrels at Ottery St Mary in Devon which finishes in the town square at midnight

'It's a typical Tory attitude to Scotland, whether north or south of the border.'

It is not the first time that Bonfire Night has caused controversy at Lewes. In 2003, residents burned a caravan with pictures of Gypsies painted on it in Firle, a village in Lewes. The vehicle bore the number plate P1KEY. 

Meanwhile, in Ottery St Mary in Devon the locals wearing gloves made out of sacks carried flaming tar barrels around the town.

The tradition of the Tar Barrel is probably around 400 years old. The original procession had the barrels being pushed by locals but then they decided that was rather wimpy so they changed to carrying them on their shoulders. 

Ottery is the only town in the country carrying full sized lighted tar barrels through the streets.

Seventeen barrels are carried throughout the day beginning in the afternoon. The barrels come in different sizes, small for the boys, medium for the women and youths, and 'gert big unz' for the men. 

Traditionally, the barrels are set alight at various pubs and hotels around the town and a tight agenda is followed until the last barrel is taken into the square around midnight.
