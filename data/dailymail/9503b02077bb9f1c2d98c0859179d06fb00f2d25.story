Ed Miliband said the idea that British Jews could be fearful of living in the UK was no longer unthinkable

Jewish parents are beginning to fear for their children’s future in Britain for the first time in a generation, Ed Miliband has claimed.

The Labour leader said ‘for the first time in their lifetime’ middle-aged Jews were scared about the rise of anti-Semitism in the UK.

Mr Miliband, himself the son of Jewish refugees, hit out amid growing concern over a spate of anti-Jewish attacks.

Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have been on the end of vile anti-Semitic attacks, sparking calls for a crackdown on internet abuse.

The Jewish Community Security Trust recorded more than 300 anti-Semitics incidents in July alone.

This is the highest monthly total it has ever recorded and a 400 per cent increase since July last year.

Mr Miliband said Britain had a proud record of ‘diversity, tolerance and respect’.

But he added: ‘In the past few months, Britain's Jewish community has expressed growing concern about a rise in anti-Semitism.

‘There have been violent assaults, the desecration and damage of Jewish property, anti-Semitic graffiti, hate-mail and online abuse.’

Mr Miliband said the recent spate of incidents should serve as a ‘wake-up call for anyone who thought the scourge of anti-Semitism had been defeated’.

He said the idea of ‘Jewish families fearful of living here in Britain’ was no longer unthinkable.

The Labour leader said: ‘Some have told me how, for the first time in their lifetime, they are scared for their children’s future in our country.

‘Others have expressed a general unease that this rise in anti-Semitism could signal that something has changed – or is changing – in Britain.’

Mr Miliband said the concerns had to be taken ‘very seriously’.

He said: ‘We need a zero-tolerance approach to anti-Semitism in the UK and to reaffirm our revulsion to it in all its forms.

‘The Labour Party has always been at the forefront of fighting intolerance. We will continue to be so.’

Mr Miliband said politicians needed to use ‘calm and responsible language’ when discussing Israel.

A zero-tolerance approach to anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms here in Britain will go hand-in-hand with the pursuit of peace in the Middle East as a key focus of the next Labour government’s foreign policy.
