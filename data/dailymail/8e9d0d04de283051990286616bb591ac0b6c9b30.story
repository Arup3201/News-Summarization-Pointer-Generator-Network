Zoologists hope that Britain's giant panda couple Tian Tian and Yang Guang will mate within days, after an unsuccessful meeting last year.

Giant pandas have a short 36-hour window just once a year within which to breed when the female panda is ovulating.

Male panda Yang Guang and female Tian Tian were introduced to each other during breeding season last year at Edinburgh Zoo, but the pair failed to mate.

Zoo workers hope male panda Yang Guang (pictured at Edinburgh Zoo) will mate with female panda Tian Tian when she comes into fertility season within the next 10 days

Yang Guang has been kept apart from Tian Tian since last year when the pair showed no interest in each other

The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) revealed that Tian Tian will be in heat within the next eight days after tests showed the necessary hormonal crossover in progesterone and oestrogen had occurred.

Throughout the rest of the year the two giant pandas are kept apart because they are naturally territorial and could attack one another.

Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas, said: ‘We are now able to predict that the important 36-hour breeding window when both pandas are likely to meet is imminent.

‘Scientific results alone would 
suggest the day is just less than 10 days away; however, as Tian Tian's 
behavioural changes are coming in so strongly, we cannot rule out that 
the key 36-hour window may be much sooner.

‘Every
individual giant panda is different and this is only the second time 
Tian Tian has come into season in Scotland, so it is difficult to make a
precise prediction at this stage.

‘The next steps are to continue behavioural observational and hormone testing to confirm when the annual window has arrived.’

Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years.

Yang Guang will have a window of just 36 hours to mate with female giant panda Tian Tian when she becomes fertile in the next 10 days

Although Tian Tian will give birth to two cubs if she mates with Yang Guang only one is likely to suvive

Edinburgh
Zoo, where the pair have lived since their arrival from China in 
December 2011, has employed a number of measures to synchronise the 
breeding cycles of the pandas, including controlled lighting, urine 
testing for hormone levels and enclosure swapping.

Mr
Valentine said: ‘When the 36-hour window is here, Tian Tian and Yang 
Guang will meet several times to have the opportunity to mate and then, 
as Tian Tian finally ovulates and her hormones fall off, artificial 
insemination will also take place.’

If
Tian Tian does fall pregnant, it will be July or the first half of 
August when Edinburgh Zoo experts will be able to confirm it by using 
ultrasound scans.

The 
majority of giant panda cubs are born at the very end of August or 
beginning of September. Although females may give birth to two young, 
usually only one survives.

The
giant pandas’ naturally slow breeding rate prevents a population in the
wild from recovering quickly from illegal hunting, habitat loss, and 
other human-related causes of mortality.

In the wild the diet of giant pandas like Yang Guang (pictured in Edinburgh Zoo) is 99 per cent made up of bamboo

Zoo goers hope that the two pandas will mate this year and produce a panda cub as a new edition to Edinburgh Zoo
