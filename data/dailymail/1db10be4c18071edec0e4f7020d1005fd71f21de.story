Most drivers used Google Street View to help them get around, but one motorcyclist in Brazil ended up crashing after trying to overtake one of the site's cars as it took pictures.

These images show the moment the motorcyclist was captured overtaking one of Google's camera cars, before trying to squeeze between a gap between two vehicles in front.

But the unfortunate man ends up clipping the side of a grey vehicle in the left hand lane, causing him to fall off his bike, right in front of a police car.

On Google Street View the motorcyclist can be seen speeding up behind the camera car before overtaking

The man can then be seen accelerating into traffic along the R.7 de Setembro road in Blumenau, Brazil

The images start by showing the man riding up alongside the street view car before speeding off into the distance and trying to take a bend.

However he loses control and hits another car before falling off into the path of the Google vehicle. 

He manages to get to his feet and run out of the way while another while Volkswagen swerves to avoid his fallen bike.

Moments later the man is back on his bike and speeding off down the bus lane, but he is followed by a police car that has been watching from the sidelines.

Despite wearing nothing but a blue t-shirt and shorts during the crash, he is apparently uninjured.

The embarrassing incident took place on the busy R7 de Setembro in Blumenau, Brazil, earlier this year, and is still visible on street view.

Brazil's roads are among the most dangerous in the world, with 43,800 people being killed there last year alone, according to the World Health Organisation.

The majority of those killed, 52 per cent, are classed as 'vulnerable road users', meaning they are pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. 

The impact is hard enough to tear off one of the car's hubcaps as the biker falls into the Google car's path
