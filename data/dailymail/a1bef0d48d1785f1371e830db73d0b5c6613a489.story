Does religious affiliation contribute to happiness?

A recent study by the Austin Institute for the Study of Family and Culture found that a strong correlation exists between religious affiliation and personal happiness. 

The institute surveyed a sample of 15,738 Americans between the ages of 18 and 60, according to the Breitbart News Network. 

Of the more than 15,000 sampled, 45 percent of those who attend a religious service on a weekly basis described themselves as 'very happy,' while only 28 percent of those who said they 'never' attend said the same.

Data: Photographed is data obtained by the Institute detailing its findings which illustrate that those who attend a weekly religious service are happier than those who 'never' attend

Those who said they never attend religious services are twice as likely to say they are 'very unhappy' as those who attend services weekly.

According to the study, this connection between religion and happiness stems from social support within the religious communities.

Being surrounded by friends and a congregation who share common beliefs and motivations is reportedly a key way in which faith and happiness connect.

Though many other factors play a role, the study found that the sense of community among those who attend and engage in religious services is the most plausible theory to explain the connection.

The link between faith and happiness is nothing new.

Past studies -- both in America and overseas-- have found that, generally, those with a faith have higher levels of 'life satisfaction' than those without, BBC News reports.

Along with generally higher levels of happiness, BBC reports that studies find that religious people are better able to cope with difficult situations, such as losing a job or a divorce.

The Austin Institute study included controlled variables such as self-reported physical health, marital status, age, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, gender, and marital happiness.

But the end results proved that the statistics tying religious affiliation to happiness have held and are continuing to hold true.
