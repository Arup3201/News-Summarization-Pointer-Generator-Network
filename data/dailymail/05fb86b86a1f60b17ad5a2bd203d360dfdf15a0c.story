Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock falsely claimed Richard Drax, 55, and wife Elsebet groped her and tried to perform a sex act on her

The lesbian housekeeper who falsely accused a Tory MP of trying to lure her into a threesome with his wife has claimed her life has been ruined by the ordeal.

Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock falsely claimed Richard Drax, 55, and wife Elsebet groped her and tried to perform a sex act on her as they drank wine in the sitting room of their Elizabethan stately home.

The case against the South Dorset MP  was dismissed at an employment tribunal after her former lover revealed she had made a series of similar claims in the past.

Judge Roger Peters, rejected all of her ‘utterly incredible’ claims at a hearing in Southampton.

But in an interview with the Sun, Ms Lyndoe-Tavistock insisted it was her life that has been left in tatters.

She said her whole life had been 'turned upside down' after the tribunal, and that she had 'lost everything'.

She insists she does not regret taking legal action, but that it had had a huge effect on her.

She said: 'I have lost my home, my job, and I have even had to sell the horses that I loved - I was pretty much left with nothing.'

She added that it had been a 'horrible week'.

Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock, 53, who lived in the Drax ancestral home, after previously working there as a groom, has received two other payouts in the last 15 years after bringing claims against former bosses, the tribunal heard.

The housekeeper’s claims were dismissed when her estranged civil partner claimed that Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock had concocted the story for financial gain.

Jo Lyndoe-Tavistock, who is divorcing her, said her former partner wanted to ‘satisfy a grudge’ and that her attitude when she was in a dispute was one of ‘I have an issue with that person, how can I get them back?’

She said her ex had brought a claim against the Royal Mail involving an alleged sexual assault, receiving a payout of £15,960.

She received another payout from the Royal Mail after alleging she had hurt her shoulder after the company overfilled a bag.

She also received a £3,000 payout from a store where she was working after another dispute.

Her ex-partner added said she believed the case against the MP was another attempt to 'extract money from an employer'.

She told the hearing: 'She knows Mr Drax is a public figure and I imagine she thought he was in a strong position to secure a settlement from him as I know she has done from previous employers.

'I believe she concocted the allegations in her claim to cause embarrassment to Mr and Mrs Drax and their family in the expectation that she would receive a financial settlement.'

A few weeks after the alleged assault, Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock said the MP told her she had an hour to leave, citing a series of fallings out she had had with other members of staff.

She said he gave her £300 and a letter falsely claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and that a severance deal would be drawn up.

The housekeeper's former partner told the tribunal that when she spoke to her after she had been sacked by the MP, she boasted she had something 'big' on him.

The housekeeper had claimed sexual discrimination, unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal and for unpaid holiday pay.

Mr Drax wiped his eyes as he sat holding his wife's hand as chairman of the panel, Judge Roger Peters, rejected her 'utterly incredible' claims.

Outside, the MP said. 'This finding vindicates our position throughout these proceedings that we acted lawfully and properly and that her serious allegations of sexual discrimination were untrue.

'These allegations have been extremely stressful for my wife and I, and my children, and my family. We are all now relieved that we can put these matters behind us.'
