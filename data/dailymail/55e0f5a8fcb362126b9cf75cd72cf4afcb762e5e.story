Removing your tattoo increases the risk of skin cancer and is as dangerous as lying on a tanning bed, according to an expert. 

Dr Ian McDougall, based on the Gold Coast Queensland, believes not enough information is given to patients who undergo the procedure and said the industry should be better regulated. 

Dr McDougall said the laser procedure can cause problems when ink pigments embedded in the skin are broken up.

'If you're going to de-pigment an area, I'm not sure what your chance of skin cancer in that area is,' Dr McDougall said.

'I'm thinking it's going to be higher.'

Queensland's radiation safety act requires owners and operators of laser tattoo removal machines to have a safety certificate, according to Nine News. 

Despite this requirement, no medical training is given to those removing ink from skin,  highlighting the lack of regulation in the industry.

But lack of training is not the only risk to patients who undergo tattoo removal.

Operators have been seen to favour cheap laser machines that have been described to consumer group Choice as causing damage to the skin. 

An unregulated machine that is popular among operators because of its cheap price is intense pulse lighting (IPL). 

According to Hilary Quinn, Melbourne Tattoo Removal proprietor, these machines increase the risk of burning or scarring.  

UV tanning beds will see a complete ban across most Australian states from the end of 2014.
