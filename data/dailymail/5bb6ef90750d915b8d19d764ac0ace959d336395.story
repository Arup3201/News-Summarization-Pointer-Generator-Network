First came Prada-style handbags for under-tens, then Liz Hurley designed bikinis for eight-year-olds.

Now, the latest item to make your little girl feel old beyond her years is a child-friendly cologne.

Cologne & Cotton’s Eau de Cologne is made in Spain and designed by Alvarez Gomez, Madrid’s oldest and most prestigious perfumery.

Cologne & Cotton's Eau de Cologne has been designed to be child-friendly

It’s said to be formulated especially for children, and can be spritzed directly onto skin or rubbed into the hands and applied.

The smell, described by the makers as ‘a refreshing gentle aroma’, is a mix of lemon blossom, Spanish lavender and mint.

All ingredients are natural and the cologne is made without chemicals.
