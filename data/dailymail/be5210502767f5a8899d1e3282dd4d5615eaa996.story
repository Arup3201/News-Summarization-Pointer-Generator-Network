A set of photographs uploaded to Reddit show a couple trying to keep a baby boy safe from various perils, including a UFO and a Tyrannosaurus rex.

Redditor ukalele wrote on the social media site 'We were asked to babysit our friends 6-month old. Sent them these hourly updates.'

The adults in the photographs were later identified by HLN as Erica Thompson and Hannes Sigrist from Switzerland.

In one photograph, Thompson is seen pushing a stroller and looking over her shoulder, while a Tyrannosaurus rex looms behind her.

A similar image shows Thompson with the stroller looking at a massive bear behind her, standing on its hind legs and apparently growling.

A creekside snap shows great white shark with its mouth open as Thompson's hand attempts to protect the baby.

Sigrist was also captured in the photo set, holding the baby while a UFO is seen above.

Hannes 
told HLN 'We were babysitting him for the first time for a full day and 
night and were therefore quite nervous.Â  After all, you want to do 
everything right, especially when it's not your own kid and we don't 
have kids of our own yet.

'After the parents, our closest friends, had left, we started imagining what's the worst thing that can go wrong and came up with these. It made us more relaxed (without being irresponsible) in the process and accounted for a really fun and great day with him.'

On Reddit, Sigrist, writing as ukalele, admitted 'True, we didn't teach the kid how to read that day,' HLN noted. 'We also didn't expand his brain by playing classical music nonstop. We didn't feed him an immune system boosting meal every 15 minutes.

'But he survived, giggled a lot was looked after the entire time by the two of us and went to bed at 7.30PM perfectly happy. And we will show him these pics in maybe 10 years or so and say: "Young man, we had an awesome time together that day."'
