Dr Anna Smajdor claims that compassion is 'not a necessary component' of healthcare

Nurses and doctors do not need to treat patients with compassion, a controversial academic has claimed.

Dr Anna Smajdor thinks staff should be able to carry out daily tasks – from removing someone’s appendix to feeding an elderly patient – without feeling any kindness towards them.

She argued that compassion ‘is not a necessary component’ of healthcare and that staff who care too much about their patients would become demoralised if they witness neglect or poor treatment on wards.

The standard of NHS care is currently
under intense scrutiny after a series of damning reports exposed 
appalling neglect at some hospitals and care homes.

Health
secretary Jeremy Hunt has implied such poor care is partly down to a 
lack of compassion among staff and has warned that a ‘culture of 
cruelty’ existed in certain organisations.

In March, Mr Hunt called for all 
student nurses to spend a year on wards carrying out basic tasks to 
prove they are capable of caring. He also wants staff pay to be linked 
to levels of kindness.

But 
Dr Smajdor – who lectures on ethics at the University of East Anglia, in
Norwich – believes that compassion will not solve any problems in the 
NHS.

Writing in the journal Clinical Ethics, she said: ‘Compassion is not a necessary component of healthcare, since the crucial tasks associated with healthcare can be carried out in the absence of compassion.

‘One can remove an appendix without caring about the person it is taken from, empty a bedpan without caring about the patient who has filled it, or provide food without caring about the person who will eat it.

‘Unless we regard healthcare professionals as saints, we cannot demand that they guarantee an unlimited flow of compassion for each patient. Indeed, it is not only unfair, but dangerous to do so.’

She went on to say that those ‘who feel compassion’ may become ‘deeply distressed’ if they witness poor care on wards, adding: ‘For this reason, the compassionate healthcare worker may be at risk of suffering burnout, fatigue, becoming desensitised, damaged and ultimately dangerous in the healthcare system.’

A Department of Health spokesman disputed Dr Smajdor’s remarks yesterday, saying: ‘Compassion is a vital element of good patient care. Many nurses represent NHS values at their finest and we let them down when poor care is not tackled.’

And Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing said: ‘There are many factors which impact on the quality of care patients receive and compassion will always play a crucial role in nursing.’ 

Dr Smajdor is an expert on controversial topics in health and science including IVF, egg donation and cloning.

Last year she called for children to be created in artificial wombs in labs – as she claimed it was unfair that only women went through the pain and suffering of childbirth.

Hospitals should put up signs saying how many nurses are working on wards to combat concerns about unsafe staffing levels, MPs have suggested.

A report from the health select committee said hospital managers should follow the example set by Salford Royal Foundation Trust in Greater Manchester, where the signs have been used since May.

They want every ward to have a whiteboard saying how many nurses should be on duty, the number of nurses on shift at the time as well as the number scheduled to work overnight.

This would alert relatives, patients and healthcare professionals to potentially dangerous staffing levels, allowing them to demand hospital bosses bring more nurses on shift.

Committee chairman and Tory MP Stephen Dorrell said: ‘If we get to the point where there are several people challenging this rather than nobody challenging then we have made some progress.

‘What I would say is look at what they do in Salford. It’s the whole issue in the health service about recognising good practice and either doing it that way or finding a better way of delivering the same result.’
