If Paul Lambert is to quell the growing discontent among Aston Villa supporters, then he'll need Christian Benteke by his side.

The Belgium international was on hand to ease the pressure on his manager on Tuesday night, scoring the winner, his first goal since March, against Crystal Palace.

Benteke, making his return from a three-match suspension, is fully fit again after an achilles injury caused him to miss the back end of last season, the World Cup and the start of the current campaign.

'I've been lucky enough to play with some of the best players in the world, and if he keeps progressing (Benteke can get there),' said Lambert.

'He offers you that potency in attack. He had that really bad injury, and his suspension never helped our case, but he's been excellent since he's been back.'

Lambert will be hoping his talismanic striker can now stay injury - and suspension - free as he looks to keep the wolves from his door.

Villa supporters have been asking real questions of Lambert; the swell of opinion for the Scot to leave is growing.

And pressure from the terraces looked to be transmitting onto the field as Villa started nervously.

Brad Guzan was saved by Ciaran Clark's goalline clearance after his fumble from Yannick Bolasie's shot was stabbed goalwards by Dwight Gayle.

The visitor's then faced strong appeals from Palace for a penalty after Tom Cleverley tangled with Wilfried Zaha, before Gayle missed his kick after Joel Ward's inviting cross.

Villa's uncomfortable start continued as Joe Cole, fresh from his first Villa goal against Burnley on Saturday, limped off in the ninth minute with a hamstring problem as the Midlanders provided nothing in the way of attacking intent inside the opening 15 minutes.

However, in the 28th minute Villa provided a spark - invariably it came from Benteke, who turned Scott Dann beautifully on the edge of the area before unleashing a right foot drive that Julian Speroni tipped over the bar.

There was no goal, but at least it was something; a semblance of fight from Villa.

And it proved the catalyst Villa's winner four minutes later in a moment Palace defender Scott Dann will want to erase from memory. 

The centre half, located on the right-hand touchline, only needed to clear Martin Kelly's pass to avert any danger - instead he dallied and was robbed by Benteke, who took full advantage by striding forward before slotting past Speroni.

Palace midfielder James McArthur was unable to close down Benteke in time to stop the Belgium international from scoring 

Guzan ensured Villa stayed in front before the break, saving from Zaha and Bolasie as Palace pressed for an equaliser before Maroaune Chamakh sent a diving header wide in the 50th minute.

Had Benteke got a touch on Ashley Westwood's dangerous inswinging free-kick or Andreas Weimann finished with just Speroni to beat then the second half would have been far more comfortable for Lambert.

But it was from pleasant for the Scot as Fraizer Campbell, on for Gayle at half-time, was denied a penalty after Clark looked to have pulled the striker down - much to Warnock's dismay.

The Palace boss was even more bewildered when Campbell, Bolasie and Dann all failed to get a toe on Zaha's low ball across the face of goal in the final minute.

'We are looking for a player like Benteke in January, I think held Villa together tonight,' admitted Warnock.

'We should have had a penalty, though, the referee's in a bad position and didn't see Campbell was pulled back.'
