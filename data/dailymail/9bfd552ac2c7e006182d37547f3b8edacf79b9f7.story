Talking in code: Nearly 150 recorded phone calls made by George Zimmerman were released by prosecutors today

Recorded phone calls released today show that George Zimmerman spoke in code while talking to his wife about life in prison and to his friend about the amount of money he had raised through an online donation site for supporters.

In addition to talking to family and friends, Zimmerman called the controversial Koran-burning pastor Terry Jones who planned to host a rally in support of the neighborhood watchman, using religious messages to urge Mr Jones to cancel the spectacle.

Almost 150 calls were made public as a continuing evidence dump by the Florida state attorney prosecution team, a number of them showing how Zimmerman was very aware that his calls were being recorded and that he and his family used codes and their bilingual language skills to keep their true meanings hidden.

As a warning at the beginning of one 
of his joint calls with his wife Shellie and his sister Susie, Zimmerman
invokes Florida's last high-profile court case.

'You
remember the Casey Anthony case? Anything you say on the phone is going
to end up on WTMJ,' he said referring to a local radio station.

Business Insider
reports that Shellie was discussing when Zimmerman would be released 
from jail, and rather than using standard dates and months, she made 
sure only those involved would understand.

'It's gonna be at Susie's birth month, maybe sooner,' she said.

'Honey, you have no idea what's going on but I cannot tell you,' she continued.

The 37-hours of calls took place while George Zimmerman was in jail after being charged with the second degree murder of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.

During a different call, Shellie became audibly upset that he had shared some information- which we still do not know- with his family.

Released: Before leaving on a bail bond on July 6 (seen above), Zimmerman used the code of his sister Susie's birth month as the way to describe the date to his wife

'Oh my God! Okay, well, if we're all screwed that's fine,' she said.

His sister Susie then interjects as a moderator of sorts.

'The thing is, that things are being recorded,' Susie said.

'I didn't say, I didn't say it like that. It was, you know, in code,' George responded, admitting that they had clearly been trying to hide their conversations.

While that supposed coded interaction 
is still unidentified, Zimmerman's phone call with controversial 
preacher Terry Jones does not appear to be covert, but Mr Jones still 
doesn't seem to understand.

On
April 19, Zimmerman appealed to Mr Jones' religious senses when he 
called to stop an upcoming rally that Mr Jones had arranged.

I
was calling today to ask you humbly, from one God-fearing sinner to 
another, for time for healing, for not only the city of Sanford but 
America,' Mr Zimmerman said in the call according to NBC News' The Grio.

'I know that your intentions are good, and I know that ultimately God will see his will be done, however, I see that Saturday -- I just ask that you allow the city to heal and America to heal.

'I just ask that perhaps instead of coming Saturday and protesting, we allow law enforcement to do their job and not lose focus, and that perhaps you could even come and visit and pray with me instead of protesting.'

Support: One of the recordings calls into question whether attorney Mark O'Mara (right) knew about the full volume of funds that had been donated to Zimmerman (left) online

Mr Jones did not give up on his plans quickly, however, simply grunting along and eventually uttering 'hmm... okay.'

He stressed that he felt the protest was necessary 'to sort of counter what has been going on in the news media and to pull us back to the Constitution and pull us back to justice and, of course, part of the message will be in the area of forgiveness.'

'I think it could be a very vital step in that area but, okay, we will definitely consider that.'

Other phone calls are lighter on the substance, containing his complaints about the fact that it took several days for him to get his anti-anxiety medication.

In another call, he tells a friend that much of the publicity of the case would have been avoided had his parents named him something more Hispanic like 'Jorge'.

The Miami Herald
says that Zimmerman's lawyer, Frank Taaffe, had been approached by 
someone identified only as 'S.H'. The paper speculates that the man in 
question may be Fox News host Sean Hannity, though the news network 
officially denied the theory on Tuesday.

Mr
Taaffe would not say who approached him on behalf of what group, but he
did say that part of the deal would involve Zimmerman using Jose Baez, 
the divisive lawyer who represented Casey Anthony.

The
first time that Zimmerman got in trouble for his coded calls was when 
he and his wife undershot the amount of money they had in their donation
account. For instance, The Huffington Post reports that they said $8 when they meant $80,000 and $37 for $37,000.

Questionable contacts: In one call, Zimmerman reminds his wife and sister to keep their language coded because of when local radio stations played Casey Anthony's (right) calls

Plea to a pastor: Zimmerman called Terry Jones (pictured), best known for wanting to burn a Koran on the anniversary of 9/11, urging him to stop a rally in support of Zimmerman so that the community could heal

While Shellie was arrested and charged with perjury on that count- and subsequently released on $1,000 bond- the latest phone calls show that Zimmerman's lawyer may have lied about knowing the true amount in the questionable account.

Publicly, attorney Mark O'Mara has denied knowing how much was in the account, which is understandable because if he did then he too can be charged with perjury or contempt of court.

Zimmerman was recorded telling his friend Scott that his lawyer had assured him that the thousands he accrued through the site were not a legal factor because 'Right now you're not working. You're not providing an income for your family. You're probably not going to be employable for the rest of your life,'

Scott asked if Mr O'Mara knew about 'the volume' of the donations and Zimmerman said no, but his prior statement shows that Mr O'Mara may have had a general idea.
