A British journalist has spoken of her shock at being targeted for arrest by the Egyptian government over her coverage of the country's political turmoil.

Award-winning reporter Sue Turton is one of 20 people singled out, accused of the trumped up charges of aiding terrorists and spreading false news.

She suspects her refusal to promote the government's political agenda in dispatches caused her to fall into the regime's crosshairs.

The country have been gripped by civil unrest and protests since former president Mohamed Morsi was toppled by the military and his Muslim Brotherhood party deemed a terrorist organisation.

In a bid to clampdown on the dissent and growing demonstrations, the military-backed Egyptian government has brought in a swathe of laws restricting protest and freedom of speech.

Ms Turton told MailOnline: 'Journalists are paying a huge price for daring to report what's really happening on the ground.'

'The Egyptian government no longer entertains any critical voices. The Egyptian domestic media only gives the military backed government's side in TV bulletins and in the press. So any journalist who reports a different perspective is now a target.   

'Just two days ago dozens of foreign journalists were arrested and beaten in what the U.S. State Department called a concerted campaign to intimidate the media. And so it continues. Our boys are in prison but so many other journalists are still being targeted.'

Ms Turton, who has worked for Britain's Sky News, ITN and Channel 4 news organisations, continued: 'I have no affiliation to any particular group. I have no gripe with the Egyptian government.

'My stories ranged from pollution in Cairo and TV satire to protests by all sides and coverage of the trial of former President Mohamed Morsi.'

Critical: Al Jazeera reporter Sue Turton is wanted by the Egyptian government

The veteran reporter, who has now left Egypt and is currently in Doha, capital city of the state of Qatar, where Al Jazeera is based, also said she feared for the fate of two colleagues who are currently languishing in squalid conditions in a Cairo prison.

Thousands of the government's critics 
have been killed since the military coup deposed, Morsi, Egypt's first 
democratically elected, in July, last year.

Ms Turton warned the crackdown has already severely hampered the free reporting of events in the country.

She
 said: 'The immediate impact of these charges and the imprisonment of 
our staff is that we have closed down our operation in Egypt completely.
 No news story is worth being locked up in this way.

'And
 it's impossible to operate freely on the streets of Cairo or other 
cities in the country.

'When I was there last summer we received a 
directive from the Ministry of Information ordering every foreign 
journalist and photographer to call in every day and tell the 
authorities where they would be working and who they were going to 
interview.

'Refusal to do this means journalists can be picked up at any 
time and detained for not complying. It's a crude attempt to fully 
control all foreign media.'

Responding to her inclusion on the list, Turton said she was 'astounded' that a warrant had been issued for her arrest.

Former BBC journalist Dominic Kane was also named on the arrest warrant, Al Jazeera said.

But the news organisation added that of the 20 people named on the list only nine were Al Jazeera staff.

Three
 of the employees on the list have been in detention since December 29th
 - correspondent Peter Greste and producers Baher Mohamed and Mohamed 
Fahmy.

Campaign: The arrest and detention of journalists has sparked an outcry among civil rights groups and western governments

Giving an update on their condition, Ms Turton said: 'They are bearing up. All three are now in the same prison cell, a blessing after weeks and weeks in solitary confinement.

'Baher is a gentle guy. I was very worried that he wouldn't be coping on his own so I'm relieved he now has Peter Greste and Mohamed Fahmy to bolster his morale.

'But we are worried about Mohamed Fahmy's health. His shoulder was dislocated before he was arrested and he needs medical attention.'

A
 journalist from the Al Jazeera Arabic channel, Abdullah Al Shami, has 
been in custody since August and is in the third week of a hunger strike
 to protest his imprisonment.

The Britons who are said to have been arrested have not been identified.

If
 found guilty at a trial, those arrested could face sentences ranging 
from three years for spreading false news to 15 for belonging to a 
terrorist group.

Prosecutors allege that the 20 journalists set up a media center for the Brotherhood in two suites in a luxury hotel.

On Tuesday, the White House called on Egypt's government to release the four journalists still in prison.

Outcry: Journalists from the foreign correspondence organisation participate in a protest demanding the release of four Al Jazeera correspondents outside the Egyptian Embassy premises in Kenya's capital Nairobi earlier this month

Call for action: Demonstrators hold placards with pictures of Al-Jazeera Arabic network journalist Abdullah Al Shami who remains in custody in Egypt, during a protest calling for their release, outside Egypt's embassy in London

'These figures, regardless of affiliation, should be protected and permitted to do their jobs freely in Egypt,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said when asked about their detention.

'We have strongly urged the government to drop these charges and release those journalists and academics who have been detained.'

Calls to release the journalists had grown earlier on Tuesday when a social media campaign blossomed after the Foreign Correspondents' Association of East Africa marched on Egypt's embassy in Nairobi - where Greste is based - to protest the jailings.
