Shaun Barker (pictured), 33, was reported missing to Queensland police on January 14

It's been a lengthy investigation into what police described as a 'vicious and horrific murder'.

Today three men were arrested over the brutal death of a Gold Coast man over what's believed to be a drug-related matter.

Police allege Shaun Barker, 33, was taken against his will late last year and was subsequently tortured and held inside an esky before he was murdered.

The remains of his body, which was burnt then buried in a forest, was discovered by forestry workers on April 10.

Homicide detectives have been investigating the matter since Mr Barker was reported missing by his sister on January 14.

Police say the 33-year-old, who's had previous dealings with police, was last sighted at a service station at Broadbeach in the Gold Coast - southeastern Queensland - on December 10, where he was assaulted and abducted.

The next day, it is believed that he was transported to Cooloola Cove in the Sunshine Coast - southeast Queensland - where he was then tortured and held in an esky for a 'lengthy period of time'.

Queeensland's South Eastern Regional Crime Coordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson wasn't able to specify how long Mr Barker was kept inside the esky but believes it could've been 'a day or days'.

Mr Barker was killed and his body was then burnt, Superintendent Hutchinson said on Saturday.

'It was certainly one of the most horrific ones [murders] that have occurred in recent times,' he said.

'What we are investigating here not only is a death but quite a vicious and horrific murder.' 

Police were able to identify and recover Mr Barker's remains after a skull was initially found by forestry workers in the Toolara State Forest on April 10.

Three men were arrested and charged on Saturday morning in relation to Mr Barker's death.

They include a 37-year-old Gold Coast man and two men from Cooloola Cove, aged 45 and 22.

The 45-year-old was arrested at Brisbane Airport after his flight landed from Thailand which was where he had been receiving medical treatment.

All three, who were previously known to police, have been charged with murder, interfering with a corpse, torture and deprivation of liberty. 

The accused murderers and Mr Barker were 'just acquaintances,' Superintendent Hutchinson said.

'We believe it was just drug related... but they had known each other for a reasonable period,' he said.

The Gold Coast man is due to appear in Toowoomba Magistrates Court on Monday.

The Cooloola Cove pair - father and son - are due to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday. 

While Superintendent Hutchinson says no further arrests are expected, he hopes the recent arrests will prompt others with further insight into the incident to come forward.

Police are also appealing for information about the location or movements of a white 1983 model 80 series Toyota Landcruiser station wagon, which at the time had a Queensland registration 817SBZ.

It is believed this is the vehicle which transported Mr Barker from the petrol station to Cooloola Cove on December 11, 2013.

Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers  1800 333 000.
