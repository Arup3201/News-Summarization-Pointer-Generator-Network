'Creepy': Those who knew prime suspect Taylor Holder have described a socially awkward teenager with a love of weapons

The prime suspect in the murder of little Alanna Gallagher was 'weird and creepy' with a violent past, according to those who knew him.

Classmates of 17-year-old Tyler Holder, who remains in a critical condition after being shot in the head by police, have described how the socially awkward teenager had a love of weapons, carried knives, and would crack sick jokes about rape.

Holder opened fire on police yesterday when they arrived to arrest him, hitting officer Charles Lodatto in the groin.

Mikayla Dawson, 16, remembered him as an 'angry person' from their days at Wayside Middle School.

She said: 'He was the kid that you were always 
really nice to because you didn’t know if he was going to come shoot up 
the school.'

Police have now confirmed neighbours have described Holder to them as a 'troublemaker' and that
he had been involved in 'criminal mischief' in the area.

One neighbour even claimed to have seen a gray tarpaulin in Holder's back garden two or three months ago, similar to that covering Alanna, 6, when she was found dead just yards from her home on Babbling Brook Drive.

Lauren Allen, 15, recalled a confrontation between her older brother and Holder a few years ago after a rare snowfall, when Holder destroyed a snowman her brother had built.

In retaliation,Lauren’s brother threw a snowball at Holder, who 'just turned around and pulled out his pocket knife'.

Lauren added: 'He was weird and creepy, and he’s been violent in the past.'

Tragic: Six-year-old Alanna Gallagher was found bound and gagged. The youngster had been raped. Right, Charles Lodotto, who he opened fire on hitting the officer in the groin

Boyfriend: Patricia Hustede banned Holder from her home after he started dating her daughter, Cassie

Cassie Hustede dated Holder until earlier this year.

The 20-year-old is currently being held in Tarrant County jail on a burglary charge, but her mother, Patricia, said that she had concerns about Holder from the beginning.

'I said to Cassie, "There’s something bad about him, keep him away from my house".'

She explained Holder would visit the house even after Cassie had gone to jail to see how she was doing.

She added: 'He fooled me. It just freaks me out that I allowed him in my house, around my kids and my grandkids.'

Weapons: Holder was said to have carried knives and pulled one on a teenage boy after destroying his snowman, according to one source

The probable cause affidavit for Holder’s arrest, obtained by WFAA-TV (Channel 8), offers new details about the suffering inflicted upon Alanna, who went missing on July 1.

The little girl, who was known for riding on her purple scooter in search of playmates, had been brutally raped.

Her partially clothed body was found by 14-year-old Owen 
Whiddon bound and wrapped in a grey tarpaulin in the middle of a street about a mile from her home later in the day of her disappearance.

Genetic evidence was matched through DNA tests to a sample that Holder voluntarily provided to police earlier this month, the documents say.

Belt: A DNA sample taken by police of Holder matched DNA found on Alanna's body and on a belt found at the scene

His DNA was also found on the buckle of a belt used to wrap Alanna’s body in the tarp.

Four Wal-Mart bags were taped over the girl’s head with red duct tape secured around her neck.

Her wrists and ankles were bound with the same tape and her body and clothes were wet with an unknown liquid.

Police later found what is believed to be the same kind of duct tape in rubbish bags outside the home Holder shared with his mother just two doors from where Alanna lived with her family.

Originally, Saginaw Police had said they had no specific suspects, but the affidavit suggests Holder was under suspicion almost immediately.

Within hours of Alanna’s body being found officers reported seeing Tyler Holder 'pacing up and down the sidewalk', the affidavit says.

Residents informed police Holder had told them that it was Alanna’s body that had been found, even before the authorities had revealed the identity of the victim.

The next day, as officers searched the Gallagher home, Holder was seen standing across the street watching.

Holder was questioned early in the investigation and told police on the day of Alanna's death he woke up about 2pm, watched television and went to apply for jobs, having recently been made unemployed by Sonic.

The affidavit reads: 'Holder stated that he had no contact with Alanna Gallagher and that she had never been in his house,'

Holder also denied having a tarpaulin in his back garden.

But video surveillance obtained from the north and south ends of Babbling Brook Drive did not show Holder driving his vehicle that day as he had said.

When they analysed his mobile phone, they found pictures of him with a garden hose in a sexual position.

During an interview, Holder had admitted that he had sex with other men.

On July 5, officers took a DNA sample from his mouth and were notified on Saturday it matched evidence found on Alanna's body.

At about 9am on Tuesday, officers arrived Holder's home in unmarked cars.

Neighbours heard them pounding on the door shortly before multiple shots rang out.

Lodatto was shot in the groin, and the bullet hit an artery and broke into pieces.

Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson said he was recovering from his injuries, although he had a long road ahead of him.

Heartbreaking: The arrest comes after Alanna's body was found tied and partially naked with a bag over her head under this tarp in the street. A 14-year-old boy came across her body

Holder was shot in the head when another officer opened fire. He was taken John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.

Holder's mother Kim was contacted on Tuesday evening. When asked about the condition of her son, she replied 'not so good'.

Her lawyer Lance Evans later added: 'Mrs Holder is in shock and is extremely worried about the condition of her son, as any mother would be.

'I ask that the Holder family’s request for privacy be honored as they come to grips with today’s events.'

Alanna's family claim they have been targeted in the aftermath of the horrific incident.

polyamorous relationship

Alanna lived with her siblings, their 
parents Laura and Karl Gallagher, and a second male, Miles McDaniel, who
was in a polyamorous relationship with her parents.

Police
have said that the Gallaghers and McDaniel were home while Alanna 
played outside alone. They are not sure when she was abducted from the 
neighborhood.

Although her body was discovered at about 7.30pm, her father did not report her missing until two hours later.

Last week, a memorial set up for the 
little girl outside her home was set on fire along with the family's car.

Saginaw Police Chief Roger Macon added that officers were not judging the parents' polyamorous relationship.
