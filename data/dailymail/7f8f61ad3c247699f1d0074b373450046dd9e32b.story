Local councils have spent more than £3million on social media since the start of the Government's austerity programme.

Public spending has been cut by billions over the past three years, but many councils have been spending ever-increasing amounts on pushing messages through sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Eight councils have spent more than £100,000 on tweeting and similar activities, with some employing members of staff solely to work on social media.

Others spent thousands keeping up to date with what people are saying about them online - behaviour more often associated with paranoid regimes than local authorities.

Critics say that councils are wasting their money on social media rather than delivering vital services or reducing the tax burden, but councillors claim they are actually saving money by shifting their communications online.

MailOnline sent Freedom of Information requests to every unitary authority, borough and county council in the UK, asking how much money they have spent on social media since 2010-11.

Dozens refused to answer, saying it is impossible to calculate how much of their employees’ time is spent updating official social media accounts.

In total, 129 councils agreed to provide details of how much they have spent on social media, including staff costs, employee training, technology purchases and advertising.

The figures show that they spent a total of £3,222,000 over the past three and a half years - a time when the Coalition Government has ordered councils to cut billions from their budgets.

That works out at an average of around £25,000 for each council which responded.

Top of the league: Newcastle City Council has spent more than any other authority on social media

The biggest spender of all was Newcastle City Council, where 13 members of staff spend at least part of their time operating social networking accounts - the council estimates that the total cost of social media since 2010-11 has been £147,480.

A spokesman for the council said: 'We're proud of our commitment to social media and in terms of Twitter followers we are one of the most followed councils in the country.

'Social media is a cost-effective and innovative way to reach people as they go about their daily lives.

'Our customer service staff use social media to receive and respond to a wide range of service requests from our customers every day. Many people in the city now prefer to contact us in this way.'

Manchester City Council came second, with a total bill of £137,626 – including £16,000 on a piece of software which allows organisations to monitor what people are saying about them on social media.

Councillor Nigel Murphy said: 'Social media is one of the main ways all modern organisations communicate and Manchester City Council is no different. The technology allows us to both listen to residents and efficiently communicate with them.'

Six other councils admitted to having 
spent over £100,000 – Belfast, Caerphilly, Cheshire East, Luton, Neath 
Port Talbot and South Ayrshire.

'Town halls should focus on keeping 
council tax low, not wasting it on barely followed Twitter accounts,' 
Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers' Alliance told MailOnline.

'Too
 often, local government bureaucrats worry too much about their presence
 on social media, rather than focussing on delivering taxpayers value 
for money.

'The best tweet a council could give out would be that they're cutting council tax and closing the account.'

Cost of video equipment bought by Buckinghamshire Council to make YouTube clips

It is not possible to break down the 
data on an annual basis, because of the different ways that councils 
provided their figures, but representative examples suggest that 
spending has been increasing rapidly.

Sunderland
 City Council spent less than £8,000 on social media staff in the whole 
of 2010-11 - but from April to October last year, a period of just seven
 months, the council spent almost £20,000, four times as much per month.

While
 most local government activity seems to be restricted to Twitter and 
Facebook, others spentd thousands on video equipment to help them 
produce professional YouTube clips - Buckinghamshire County Council 
bought a camera, autocue and clip-on microphones for nearly £4,000.

Many councils have sent staff to 
attend social media training courses which can cost hundreds or even 
thousands of pounds a time.

For
 example, Antrim Borough Council in Northern Ireland has paid for five 
different courses, including one on 'engaging with citizens through 
social media' and another on 'building a social media strategy'.

And
 for the council which governs Shetland, a similar course had an extra 
cost - the islands are so remote from the British mainland that 
officials had to spend £685 on flights in order to attend the training.

Money-saver? Councils claim that using Facebook helps them cut costs on traditional forms of communication

Waste? Campaigners say councils would be better off shutting down their Twitter accounts

Many local authorities insisted that spending thousands on social media allowed them to save money by cutting down on activities such as sending press releases or letters to residents.

A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: 'Councils use social media like every other private and public organisation. It is a vital and immediate way to communicate efficiently and effectively.

'For example, during severe weather bouts social media is relied upon by millions of residents wanting to know if vital services are running and transport networks are open. It is also often the only way that many people can access this information from their local authority.

'In addition to keeping residents informed, using new technology, including social media, has helped councils save millions of pounds. Communicating with residents is of huge importance, especially with councils having to make difficult decisions about how they pay for vital services.

'An average annual cost of £4,000 per council is good value considering the impact and reach that social media has.'

How much Shetland Council spent on flying staff to social media training

Some councils' social media accounts appear to have a relatively small following - for example, Derby City Council has fewer than 10,000 Twitter followers and just 1,100 Facebook fans, despite a population of 250,000.

The council has nonetheless spent more than £80,000 on social networking, working out at £7.50 for each online follower.

Newry & Mourne, in Northern Ireland, has spent even more per person - £12.30 for every one of the 3,500 residents who are signed up to its Facebook and Twitter pages.

Nearly 80 councils said that they either spend negligible amounts on social media or that they could not work out how much time employees spent on Facebook and Twitter - even though other local authorities, including big-spending Newcastle, were able to provide minute breakdowns of staff duties.

Louis High, communications director at Redbridge Borough Council, said that social media has become so integrated into day-to-day work that it is impossible to separate Twitter and Facebook from more traditional media such as press releases.

'Social media is a major tool for us,' he said. 'But I'd find it completely impossible to put a figure against it.'

A number of councils, including Edinburgh and Wigan, told MailOnline that they employ a member of staff whose main job is to update social media, but refused to reveal the worker's salary for fear of breaching data protection rules.

Around two dozen councils simply failed to respond to the Freedom of Information request within the legally mandated 20-day limit.

'Every bit of the public sector needs to do their bit to pay off the inherited budget deficit, including local government which accounts for a quarter of all public spending,' said a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government.

'Councils should focus on cutting waste and making sensible savings to protect frontline services and keep council tax down.

'If councils are making greater use of social media, then they should be able to drive down costs or remove costs completely. Cutting overall spending on communications is a good way of making sensible savings.'
