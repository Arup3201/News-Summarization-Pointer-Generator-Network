A young baker has created her own sweet tribute to the Duchess of Cambridge - by turning her into a cake.

Lara Clarke, who has only been baking for two years, made the unusual memento to commemorate Kate's pregnancy.

And the Duchess is not the only celebrity to be transformed into sponge and icing.

Miss Clarke created the white chocolate topper of the Duchess to show anyone could be made in chocolate

Miss Clarke has also made incredible iced figures of Johnny Depp, Yoda and the Grinch.

The mouth watering models are hand crafted and take hours of intensive labour to achieve their realistic effect.

The 27-year-old from Walsall, West Midlands, has created about 50 mouth-watering custom cakes in all shapes and sizes.

She said: 'When Kate Middleton announced her pregnancy I created a white chocolate topper of the Duchess in celebration.

'I wanted to show that I could make anybody out of chocolate, and she's so pretty it was a lovely challenge.'

Miss Clarke has created dozens of custom-made designs including the Go Compare man (pictured)

Miss Clarke, who works for Tombola online bingo, handpaints the figures with food colouring.

The four foot high Grinch cake took over 40 hours to create and has an internal wooden structure to keep it upright.

She said: 'It was made of chocolate sponge and vanilla icing, covered in fondant.

'There was enough to feed 500 people.

'I taught myself to bake cakes from YouTube and TV shows. Once I started I just couldn't stop.'

Miss Clarke spends hours perfecting her realistic designs, such as this Triumph motorbike cake

The unusual requests from customers include a beer can cake (left) and a dog's head cake (right)

This labour intensive design features handbags, a rabbit, keys, euro notes and a camera with real photograph

Miss Clarke's talent has led her business, Tasty Cakes, to receive requests for crazy cakes and ditzy desserts.

She said: 'I get quite a lot of crazy cake requests, mostly for birthdays or weddings.

'I once made a full dog head cake for a woman who wanted to celebrate her dogs birthday.

'I love baking, the moment I start I lose track of time, I just concentrate on making the cakes as life-like as possible.'
