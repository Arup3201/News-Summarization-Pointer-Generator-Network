Terrified passengers on a jet flying between Australia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have taken to social media to tell how a mystery passenger set five fires in the toilets.

The Etihad Airways jet made an emergency landing in Indonesia after the first fires broke out in the toilets - but later, two hours before the aircraft was due to land in the UAE city of Abu Dhabi three more fires erupted.

On arrival in Abu Dhabi police questioned passengers in small groups in the hope of finding the suspect. No arrests have been made but there are reports that police are investigating a female passenger.

Panic in the skies: An Etihad flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi was disrupted by five fires lit by a mystery offender

Sarah Jeffery, a passenger on the flight from Melbourne, told The Age she woke suddenly to a 'loud alarm, a flashing red light and rushing crew members'.

'I looked and saw flames coming from the bin in the toilet, and two cabin crew members put it out,' she said.

'It was very smoky, and it felt like the aircraft had filled with smoke.'

After the first two fires, the Boeing 777-300ER landed in Jakarta, where the plane was evacuated and passengers' bags were checked. Nothing was found and the passengers were allowed to continue their flight.

Another fire was discovered as the plane was flying above the Indian Ocean. Crew members, who had been preparing breakfast at the time the fire ignited, quickly extinguished the blaze.

'At this point, we were all asked to remain seated, and the toilets couldn’t be used,' Ms Jeffrey said.

‘I was very frightened that we had two more hours before reaching Abu Dhabi, and I actually sent messages to my boyfriend and son telling them how much I loved them, in the hope that if anything happened they would receive them.'

Professional golfer Caroline Martens, who was on the flight, wrote on Instagram: 'Try having someone set the plane on fire, in two different places, having to emergency land in Jakarta, get back on after hours of investigations, for the IDIOT to set three more fires in three more toilets while mid-air and nowhere to land!!!'

Ms Martens, 27, who was heading home after competing in the Australian Masters tournament, told Norwegian radio and television public broadcasting company NKR that a fire was started on board 'directly while we were above the sea', reported The Age.

A disgruntled passenger takes to Instagram to complain about the flight, which was forced to land in Jakarta after two fires were lit in the cabin toilets in mid-air. After security checks took place, the passengers returned to the plane and completed their journey to the United Arab Emirates, but three more fires were lit

Distressing flight: Etihad cabin crew put the plane on lock down due to the fires and people were unable to leave their seats and no food was served for the last part of the journey

'After a few hours (into the flight from Melbourne) I noticed that it smelled like smoke...but I thought everything was fine and just fell asleep.'

'About two hours after, I woke up as the fire alarm went off again,' said Ms Martens.

She tells of how the airline searched passengers on the emergency stopover in Jakarta and the fear caused when the passengers had to board the plane after nothing was found. Passengers were told that due to visa issues they had to get back on the plane and could not remain in Jakarta.

'We were all sent on a plane again without knowing who had done it. It is just not nice to know that someone will set fire to the aircraft you will be travelling with,' said Ms Martens.

She said the flight attendants had told her that because of the compression in the cabin fires needed to be extinguished within 90 seconds.

A worried daughter told The Age about her parents' 'horrible and stressful' journey, saying that the 'worst thing was that no-one explained the situation either to me or to my parents.

'They didn't drink or eat anything for 19 hours and they had to have their diabetes medicine.'

A spokesman for Etihad said today: 'The Abu Dhabi police authorities are currently investigating the incidents and are interviewing crew and passengers.

'Etihad Airways will release further information as it becomes available.'
