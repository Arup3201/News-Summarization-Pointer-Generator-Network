Hillary Clinton has revealed that she has not driven a car in 18 years because Secret Service protocols prevent her from getting behind the wheel.

The former Secretary of State and likely Democratic presidential candidate spoke today at a conference for the National Automobile Dealers Association in New Orleans.

She said that the last time she drove herself in a car was in 1996 and apparently that didn't end well.

Back seat driver: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revealed that she hasn't driven a car herself in 18 years

'The last time I actually drove a car myself was 1996 and I remember it very well and unfortunately so does the Secret Service which is why I haven't driven since then,' she said.

'I've always enjoyed stories about cars and adventures and I have to confess that one of the regrets I have about my public life is that I can't drive anymore.

'My husband thinks that's a blessing but he's the one who should talk.'

Mrs Clinton was first granted Secret Service protection in 1991, during her husband's first campaign for President.

That was carried through both of his White House terms and has now been extended for life after the limit for former presidents was pushed from 10 years after leaving office to their lifetimes.

Previous earlier reports, dating back to when Mrs Clinton was running for president herself in 2008, cite unidentified aides who said that she sometimes drove her hybrid S.U.V. when she was at their home in Chappaqua, New York.

Comes with the territory: The Clintons, seen together on January 1, were granted Secret Service protection ahead of his first election in 1991 and will have it for their lifetimes

Not anymore: Bill Clinton was able to drive his wife and daughter (and an unidentified friend) to his 46th birthday party in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1992 before he won the presidential election

Though it comes as little surprise that she expressed regret over her driving ban while speaking to a group of car manufacturers and sellers, her husband's inability to drive is something that has bothered him for some time.

During an interview on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show in August 2012, the former President said that driving was the one thing he missed about his life before the White House.

'Whenever I'm on the golf course I always make them let me drive the golf cart,' he said.

Mr Clinton said that there was no foreseeable change coming up soon- and that has nothing to do with his wife's expected run for office.

'If I want to give up Secret Service protection for life, I could do it,' he said of driving.

During her speech today, Mrs Clinton also told a story about how one of her old cars was stolen and the theives later used it in a high-speed chase.

'I couldn't understand how they could get it to perform when I never could,' she said, according to The Wall Street Journal.

'I was a little proud of it.'

Mrs Clinton, who commands speaking fees of upwards of $200,000, touched on far more serious subject as well, saying that assasination of Osama bin Laden was a highlight of her time as Secretary of State while the terrorist attack on the American consulate in Benghazi was the low point.

She said that the death of the three Americans and Ambassador Chris Stevens was 'obviously a great personal loss because I am the one who sent him there'.
