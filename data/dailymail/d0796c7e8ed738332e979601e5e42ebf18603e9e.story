The National Tennis Centre will no longer be the base for Britain's elite players, the Lawn Tennis Association has confirmed.

Chief executive Michael Downey is making his presence felt after taking up the role at the start of the year, and the high-performance programme is set for a major overhaul.

Downey, formerly the head of Tennis Canada, employed highly-respected coach Bob Brett to assess the state of Britain's under-performing elite programme.

Change: Chief executive Michael Downey is making his presence felt after taking up his role earlier this year

The tough Australian, who has been given a permanent role as player development director, is known to have been distinctly unimpressed and decentralisation is one of his key recommendations.

The NTC in Roehampton, which cost an estimated £40million, was the brainchild of former chief executive Roger Draper and opened in 2007.

The country's top young talent was encouraged to move down to the capital, but the hoped for improvement never materialised to justify the huge investment.

The NTC will remain the LTA's administrative base and the facilities are expected to continue to be used by leading senior players based in London.

The young players in the high-performance programme will be directed towards the country-wide network of high-performance centres, although more changes will come into effect as Brett's recommendations are implemented.

In a statement responding to a story in the Daily Telegraph, the LTA said: 'The National Tennis Centre (NTC) remains an important part of Britain's high-performance set-up, although the existing performance programme will be modified over the next few months.

'The NTC programme will strive to be a centre of excellence for camps where Britain's best under-10 to under-16 players will be routinely invited to regroup with their coaches under the leadership of Bob Brett and national coaches.

'The centre will continue to serve as the home base for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup teams, as well as a drop-in centre for Britain's professional players.

'It will also remain the base for our national high-performance wheelchair programme and we will continue to look at ways to maximise the use of the centre for junior high-performance competition.

'Most of the high-performance players who were part of the national programme and based at the NTC are making plans to relocate to high-performance centres.'
