The daughter of former NFL quarterback Mark Brunell has been crowned Miss Alabama - three years after her father made a very public bankruptcy filing.

Caitlin Brunell, 22, will represent Alabama in the Miss America pageant this year after exhibiting her dancing ability and starting her own charity that gives prom dresses to girls from poor families.

However, her father made headlines in recent years after declaring bankruptcy over a series of bad real estate and business investments. This, despite earning a $50million fortune during his 19 seasons in the NFL.Â 

Miss Brunell was previously Miss University of Alabama and held the title of Miss Leeds Area, Alabama.

'I'm in complete shock. I don't know if I even have words to describe, but I have worked so hard for this moment,' she told AL.com.

'I could not be more proud to represent this state. This is an absolute honor and blessing. I'm just so thankful.'

She won the contest after performing a dance choreographed to the song 'Let It Go' from the Disney movie 'Frozen.'

Miss Brunell, a University of Alabama graduate, joins famous company among pageant winners. Fellow Alabama alumna Katherine Webb, who won Miss Alabama USA in 2012, found national fame after being revealed on live television as the girlfriend of then-Crimson Tide quarterback AJ McCarron.

Miss Webb, however, represented Alabama for the Miss USA contest, a competing beauty pageant to Miss America.

Miss Brunell's father Mark was a three-time Pro Bowl star quarterback of the Jacksonville Jaguars. He also played for the Green Bay Packers, Washington Redskins, New Orleans Saints and New York Jets.

In his last year in the NFL, 2011, he filed for bankruptcy, claiming more than $25million in debts and just $5million in assets.

It was reported that over the term of his NFL career, he made more than $50million.

Mr Brunell's attorneys say he lost of the money on bad real estate bets, as well as a a failed bid to open several Whataburger fast food restaurants.
