He is a devout Catholic who voted against same-sex marriage – but there’s at least one person Tory MP David Amess hasn’t persuaded to share his traditionalist views: his own daughter Katie.

The 27-year-old aspiring actress is hoping to make her mark in Hollywood with a movie spoof called Misérable Lesbians, which aims to promote gay equality.

She said: ‘I have always been  pro-gay rights. Misérable Lesbians is a jokey title with a very serious message, which is that everyone deserves equal rights.

Blonde Courgette is played by Katie Amess daughter of Tory MP David. They say that the film has a serious message

‘I love my father and he’s entitled to his opinion but I disagree with him on gay marriage.’

The 61-year-old Commons veteran – who defied his close friend David Cameron on the same-sex marriage vote in February – has not seen the film yet and Katie admits: ‘It’s not at all his cup of tea.’Katie, a former Miss Essex, now lives in the gay-friendly neighbourhood of West Hollywood, sometimes dubbed Boys’ Town.

In the film, she plays ‘Courgette’ – a play on the character of Cosette in the original Les Misérables. She is a young girl who ‘fights the good fight’ in revolutionary France to help a rebel band of lesbians achieve their goal of sexual freedom.

She said: ‘A lot of the lyrics in Misérable Lesbians are not suitable to print in a family newspaper.’

‘The film was made on a shoestring but it’s the biggest part I’ve had so far and it was great fun to make. I’m hoping this is my big break.’

Katie says that her dad has not seen the spoof but that it would not be his cup of tea

The short film was made for the Toscar 
Awards – an event for parodies run by Britons based in Los Angeles – 
where it won eight prizes, and is now set to be expanded into a 
45-minute stage play for the Edinburgh Fringe in August.

Katie hopes her dad will come ‘with the rest of my family and friends’ to see that version.

‘He and I don’t talk politics,’ she added. ‘But he’s always been very supportive of my dreams of being an actress.

‘I have my own views and I am very pro-gay rights, even though I am straight myself I believe everyone should be treated equally and I am proud to do my bit to support gays and lesbians and raise awareness of this very important issue.  I am sure Dad is happy I am finally working. Mum’s watched the film, but Dad hasn’t.’

Misérable Lesbians writer and director Sandro Monetti said: ‘Gay rights is a hot topic around the world right now and through our comedy musical we hope not only to make people laugh but also to make them think.

Our show is about women in 19th Century France locked up for the crime of falling in love with each other. They – and the brave rebels who support them – dream a dream of gay marriage one day being legal. 

‘The recent change to legalise gay marriage in France is a cause for celebration for many, and hopefully this show will be too. 

‘We have schoolboy humour, and characters but there’s a serious message amid all the silliness. Katie is an outstanding talent and is integral to the success of the project.’

Last night MP Amess said: ‘Obviously I have heard all about the spoof film Misérable Lesbians but have yet to see it. I am hoping to go to Edinburgh to see the performance in the summer.’ 

In a statement he added: ‘We are enormously proud of our daughter and her utter determination to make a success of her acting career. We also fully recognise what a very tough industry it is and how highly competitive.’

Katie admits that she has struggled to make it since arriving in Hollywood two years ago: ‘I’ve been on lots of auditions and I’ve done quite a few commercials,’ she said. ‘But Misérable Lesbians is my first proper film role.’

She and her castmates are trying to raise money to stage the show in Edinburgh and off-Broadway in New York through the crowdfunding website Indiegogo.com, while the original short film is available to view on YouTube.
