At Selhurst Park last Saturday, when Chelsea were playing Crystal Palace, an act of supreme sportsmanship passed almost unnoticed.

Not quite in the same league as Paolo Di Canio when he caught the ball inside the Everton penalty area at Goodison Park after Paul Gerrard dislocated his knee in December 2000.

Or UEFA giving Robbie Fowler a fair play award after he pleaded with referee Gerald Ashby not to award a penalty to Liverpool when he went down under a challenge from Arsenal keeper David Seaman in 1997.

Still, Jose Mourinho’s generosity should be highlighted, particularly after a weekend of football that finished with Swansea manager Garry Monk accusing Stoke winger Victor Moses of cheating.

Mourinho’s rampant Chelsea team were 2-0 up passing the ball for fun as Palace willed it to go out of play for them to make a substitution.

At the time, with Chelsea in complete control after goals from Oscar and Cesc Fabregas, it felt like Palace manager Neil Warnock would be made to wait for ever.

Both teams were already down to 10. Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta was sent off for a studs-up challenge on Mile Jedinak and Palace defender Damien Delaney was sent off for a second booking before half-time.

With 21 minutes left, Warnock’s team were temporarily reduced to nine when James McArthur was forced off the field with an ankle injury.

It was then that Mourinho approached Warnock in the technical area.

Mourinho passed a message to Fabregas, the closest Chelsea player to the technical area and his team suddenly eased off. 

Palace were finally able to get the ball out of play.

Warnock made the substitution, bringing on Adlene Guedioura to replace McArthur to even the teams up, numerically at least.

To Mourinho’s credit he then instructed Oscar, who received the ball from Chelsea’s throw-in, to kick the ball back to Palace keeper Julian Speroni. The Brazilian obliged.

It was a magnificent sporting gesture. There are times when it is easy to bury Mourinho for his touchline posturing, but he has been on his best behaviour of late.

Against Arsenal on October 5, he had very little involvement in the incident which led to Arsene Wenger shoving him in the chest during their 2-0 defeat.

There was the usual mischief in the air last Friday when he reacted to news that Wenger had got off scott-free after the incident at Stamford Bridge. ‘Me? Me? Me?’ he joked. ‘Stadium ban’.

He has taken to answering tricky situations by lacing them with sarcasm to avoid appearances on the back pages for all the wrong reasons.

Mourinho is usually far more gracious when his team are winning and he is has certainly been in a better mood of late.

Ahead of the game at Palace, which they eventually won 2-1, Chelsea’s manager claimed he is ‘a humble guy who tries to learn every day’.

He was referring to Roy Keane’s criticism of Mourinho after he attempted to shake hands with Paul Lambert when his team were beating Aston Villa 3-0 on September 27.

He is no angel on the touchline, we know that.

Last season he provoked Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini when he jumped into the stands to celebrate with his son Jose Jnr after Fernando Torres’ last-minute winner.

He has since apologised for jabbing former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova, sadly no longer with us, in the eye during a highly-charged Super Cup tie with Real Madrid in 2011.

He has cleaned up his act on the touchline, something he has spoken about since his return to English football with Chelsea.

Last March he said: ‘In this country, it’s easier to behave because almost everybody behaves and the fourth officials are there to help, not create more problems.

‘Normally they’re there to speak and have a dialogue, telling you to calm down, that you don’t need to do that, mustn’t make it difficult for the referee. I know I have that responsibility to show maturity.

‘I know I have normally a better emotional control than one year ago, two years ago, five years ago. I know experience helps.’

He was on the edge of the technical area for all the right reasons on Saturday when he he spoke with Warnock about making the change to make it ten versus ten again.

Would he have made the same gesture if Chelsea weren’t in complete control, ‘from minute one to minute 94’, as Mourinho remarked after the game?

Actually, let’s not go there.
