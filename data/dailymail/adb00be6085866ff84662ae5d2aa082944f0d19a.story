Over the past two years, the duo – real names Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly – have starred in a series of Morrisons campaigns

They're the nation’s favourite hosts of Saturday night TV, but cheeky chappies Ant and Dec will no longer be the face of struggling supermarket chain Morrisons, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Over the past two years, the duo – real names Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly – have starred in a series of Morrisons campaigns. 

But now they and the retailer have parted company, ripping up their multi-million advertising deal.

And last night there was mystery over who exactly had ended the relationship. 

Sources close to Ant and Dec said they had been offered another 12-month contract but turned it down. 

However, business insiders told The Mail on Sunday that Morrisons would not renew the deal because it wants future advertising to emphasise its value credentials and the quality of its food, which the duo no longer represent.

Analyst Bryan Roberts, of market research firm Kantar Retail, said: ‘In marketing terms, this is absolutely the right thing to do.

'People turn on the television and see two incredibly wealthy lads being well paid to advertise a supermarket which is supposed to be helping us save money.

‘People are far more savvy these days and they can make that connection.’

Morrisons reported profits down by 52 per cent to £345 million last week – its worst results in eight years. 

And chairman Andy Higginson said it had slashed the value of its property portfolio by £1.3 billion.

Both Morrisons and Ant and Dec declined to comment on the decision.

Sources said the supermarket chain decided not to renew the advertising contract with the pair
