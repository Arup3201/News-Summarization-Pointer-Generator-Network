Having come within a whisker of recording a shock victory over New Zealand, England were back in training on Wednesday looking towards going one better than their heroic failure at Eden Park.

Stuart Lancaster's team were under strength in their 20-15 defeat at the hands of the All Blacks, who only stole victory thanks to a late Conrad Smith try in Auckland on Saturday.

Ranks boosted: Courtney Lawes trains with the England squad ahead of the second test with New Zealand

On the ball: Along with Lawes, Dylan Hartley was another Northampton Saints player boosting England's ranks

Focused: Tom Wood looks on during training, with England set to announce their squad for the second test

Chris Ashton (Saracens) Brad Barritt (Saracens) Luther Burrell (Northampton Saints) Lee Dickson (Northampton Saints) Owen Farrell (Saracens) Ben Foden (Northampton Saints) Alex Goode (Saracens) Dylan Hartley (Northampton Saints) Courtney Lawes (Northampton Saints) Stephen Myler (Northampton Saints) Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins) Billy Vunipola (Saracens) Alex Waller (Northampton Saints) Anthony Watson (Bath Rugby) Richard Wigglesworth (Saracens) Tom Wood (Northampton Saints)

But England's ranks are boosted by the inclusion of 16 players, including Courtney Lawes, Dylan Hartley, Billy Vunipola, Tom Wood and Owen Farrell.

Lancaster's squad sees an influx of Northampton and Saracens stars who had missed the Eden Park defeat due to their participation in the Aviva Premiership final.

Danny Care had jarred his shoulder in a 
freak training ground accident last week but along with Billy 
Twelvetrees trained with team-mates for the final timeÂ  ahead 
of the team being announced at approximately 11.15pm BST on Wednesday.

Lancaster's side are looking to avoid defeat at the Forsyth Barr Stadium on Saturday in the second test, with another loss enough to ensure New Zealand would win the three-match series.
