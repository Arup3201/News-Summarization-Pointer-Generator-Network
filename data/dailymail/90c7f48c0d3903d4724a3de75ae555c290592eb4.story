A 12-year-old girl allegedly tried to kill her own mother by poisoning a smoothie with bleach after she had her iPhone taken away.

The girl, who has not been named but lives in Boulder, Colorado, allegedly blended the smoothie earlier this month, spiked it with the caustic liquid, then fed it to her unwitting mother, who drank it.

Her throat was burned by the bleach, and she had to be treated in hospital - but wrote the incident off as a mistake until her daughter tried again, according to police.

The Boulder County sheriff's department said that on her second attempt the woman poured bleach into a water carafe by her mother's bed.

When she smelled bleach again she reportedly confronted the girl - who admitted the attempts on her life were vengeance for having her smartphone taken away.

She was later arrested. According to ABC News, she was charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder on Friday.

A police spokesman said: 'On March 6, 2015, deputies of the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office were dispatched to Boulder Community Hospital to investigate an assault.

'Subsequent investigation has developed evidence that a 12-year-old Boulder County girl attempted to kill her mother on two separate occasions.

'On both attempts the girl used bleach. The first attempt on March 2, 2015 left her mother feeling ill after her daughter placed bleach into a breakfast smoothie she made.

'Mom noticed an odor of bleach in the drink and thought her daughter had cleaned the glass prior to making the beverage and did not rinse all the bleach out.

'Later in the week the girl poured bleach into a water carafe her mother kept in the bedroom. On the second occasion Mom noticed the odor of bleach in her water and confronted her daughter.

'This is when she learned her daughter had developed the plan to kill her for taking away her iPhone.

'The juvenile was detained at the Boulder County Juvenile Center.'
