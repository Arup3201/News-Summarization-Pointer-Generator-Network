Scottish voters are set to narrowly reject independence today, according to the last poll published before the result is announced tomorrow morning.

The ‘No’ campaign goes into today’s referendum six points clear of the Alex Salmond’s nationalists – with 53 per cent of those certain to vote telling pollsters they will opt against separation.

Among those certain to vote, 50 per cent say they will vote No, with 45 per cent saying they will back independence. A further 4 per cent are still undecided, according to the pollsters Ipsos MORI.

The 'No' campaign holds a narrow lead going in to today's referendum, according to the last poll carried out before the result  is announced tomorrow

Just under half - 46 per cent – of Scottish voters believe the Better Together campaign will win the referendum, compared with just 30 per cent who think the Yes campaign will win .

Today’s poll for the Evening Standard, shows a small increase in support for the ‘No’ campaign.

A series of surveys released last night showed the battle over independence going down to the wire – with the Better Together campaign ahead by just four percentage points.

But Ipsos MORI found that women were dividing conclusively against independence – swinging the balance to the ‘No’ campaign.

Men favoured independence 53-47, but women were splitting 42-58.

Those aged 25 to 34 were the most passionate separatists – with just under three quarters backing independence. But those aged over-55 were split two-to-one in favour of No.

Ipsos MORI interviewed 991 over-16s in Scotland by telephone yesterday and the day before.

In a survey published by the same pollsters yesterday - among those who said that they are ‘absolutely certain’ to vote tomorrow – 49 per cent said they intended to vote No, with 47 per cent backing independence. Five per cent remained undecided.

Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI, said: ‘These results confirm the picture from other polls before polling day – the referendum looks extremely close, and although No seems to have a small lead much will depend on turnout on the day.

'Meanwhile there is a clear difference in the motivations for voters on the two camps – Yes voters saying they are motivated more by hope for the future if their side wins, while No voters say fear for the future if the No side loses has been more important to their vote.'

Polling booths opened across the country at 7am this morning, with turnout expected to hit 90 per cent

Polling booths opened at 7am this morning for fifteen hours of voting which will decide the future of the UK.

The historic result will be announced tomorrow morning after all-night counts across Scotland of about four million votes.

US President Barack Obama intervened again for the union side, posting a signed tweet on his White House account which read: ‘The UK is an extraordinary partner for America and a force for good in an unstable world. I hope it remains strong, robust and united.’

But tennis star Any Murray, who has for weeks refused to take sides, came off the fence in a tweet saying: ‘Let’s do this!’

He said he had been turned away from the ‘No’ campaign because of its ‘negativity’.

He wrote: ‘Huge day for Scotland today! No campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets [sic] do this!’

The independence campaign is set to go down to the wire today - with the public split down the middle over whether to stay in the UK or become 'an independent country'.

But the debate has divided the country into distinct camps battling for Scotland's future. 

Polls have consistently shown that women, pensions, the middle classes - and Britons born outside Scotland comfortably in favour of the Union. 

Middle-aged men and the working classes meanwhile are strongly in favour of independence. Here MailOnline reveals the fault lines in Scottish society as the nation goes to the polls today.
