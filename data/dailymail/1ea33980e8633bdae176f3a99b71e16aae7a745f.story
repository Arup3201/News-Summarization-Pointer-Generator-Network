British merchant seamen who were kept as prisoners-of-war in Germany passed the time by holding elaborate horse racing events, a newly discovered archive has shown.

The Merchant Navy Jockey Commission (MNJC) was formed by Andy Fairgrieve in 1941 to hold meetings and raise money for charity during World War Two.

Inmates built an indoor track measuring nearly 36ft in length and the small 'horse' pieces were moved along by 'race course' officials after dice were rolled.

It was arranged so that six runners could follow a field varying in length from six furlongs to 1.25 miles.

The merchant seamen (above) were held at Marlag und Milad Nord camp, near Westertimke, Germany from late 1941 to early 1942

They even fashioned an electronic board so that onlookers could keep an eye on the progress of their fancies.

During the weekly meetings, there were three races of six furlongs, two steeplechases of one mile and a final event of a mile and a quarter - up to 600 men watched each meeting.

Mr Fairgrieve’s 'Wartime Log' includes race results and betting history and also numerous cartoon drawings of the prisoners enjoying the occasions.

The events raised large sums of money for the Red Cross, and one account from February 1943 shows that the charity fund had raised 18,000 RM (marks).

The prisoners were held at Marlag und Milad Nord camp, near Westertimke, from late 1941 to early 1942.

The merchant seamen - who were classed as non-combatants - referred to the camp as 'Milag', and under the banner of Fairgrieve’s MNJC they formed the 'Milag Jockey Club'.

Included are the badges worn by 'officials' and jockey club committee members and posters advertising important races.

There are photos of the men and programmes for theatre productions that were put on.

There is a menu for Christmas dinner in 1943 which includes Champagne cocktail, roast chicken, Christmas cake, chocolate wafers and coffee and cognac.

The archive is expected to fetch up to £800 when it goes under the hammer at Dominic Winter saleroom near Cirencester, Gloucestershire, on Thursday.

Chris Albury, from the saleroom, said: 'You often get accounts from World War One in which the prisoners seemed to be held in a holiday camp.

'But in the Second World War it was usually much more brutal, but because these men were non-combatants they seem to have been able to have a bit of fun and raise money for charity.

'They weren’t digging tunnels but were concerned in how to pass the time and gamble on the horses.

'It’s quite amusing and adds another dimension to the social history of the war and is not something that would immediately spring to people’s minds.

'It seems like a strange little world and Andy Fairgrieve kept a log and it included all the details of the bets and the races.

'It is a fascinating and interesting archive and I’m sure there will be a lot of interest.'

The archive is new to market but not direct from family.
