You can find pretty much anything to buy on eBay, from cast-off clothing to entire homes and perhaps soon, Jose Canseco's severed finger.

The former baseball star, and admitted doper, tweeted Monday night that he plans to list  his left middle finger on eBay, which he accidentally shot off last month while cleaning a handgun.

Doctors at first reattached the finger after the October 29 accident, but the limb fell off while the 50-year-old retired slugger was playing poker last week and now appears to be unusable.

Any bids? Former baseball star Jose Canseco accidentally shot off his left-hand middle finger last month while cleaning his gun at home in Las Vegas, Nevada. On Monday, he tweeted about selling it on Ebay

'I will soon put the finger that fell off in the poker tournament on eBay for sale,' Canseco tweeted Monday night.  

'The eBay ad will read slightly used middle finger with 462 home runs could be used as a stirring straw for drinks,' he joked. 

Canesco went on to offer the finger as a package deal, with the 45-caliber Remington gun that shot it off on October 29.

However, it's almost certain that Canseco won't follow through with the plan, since eBay's policies do not allow the sell of firearms or human remains unless they are 'items containing human scalp hair, and skulls and skeletons intended for medical use.'  

Following the incident in October, he broke down while speaking to Inside Edition about the ordeal.

Describing what happened, he said: 'At first I heard it go off and I actually grabbed the gun and put it on the table.

'(I) thought nothing had happened. Then I look at my hand and my finger’s blown off.' 

Canseco explained the bullet only narrowly missed his fiance, swimwear model Leila Knight, who was standing nearby. She quickly ran to his aid.

'I was telling Jose not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out,' Knight told Inside Edition.

Knight wrapped his hand in a towel and called 911. 'I’m just glad nothing happened to her (Knight),' Canseco said.

Accident: Canseco had returned from the shooting range on October 29, when he decided to clean his 45-caliber Remington handgun and it fired. Pictured left in 2013, and on the right with Oakland Athletics in 1992 

'If it’s a lesson having to lose a finger, so be it.'

Knight said her fiance had been at a shooting range a few days earlier. He then decided to clean the weapon but didn't realize it was still loaded.

'The middle finger was hanging by a thread, and I wrapped his hand in a towel and then called 911,' Knight told the newspaper. 

'He blew away an artery and a big bone chunk.'

The Cuban-American dominated the MLB with his hitting prowess in the 1980s, but later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs for much of his career.

Canseco is a right-handed batter who hit 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star.

He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay, the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox during a career that spanned from 1985 to 2001.
