Finding a pay-and-display parking space can be frustrating enough - and now, even if you do, the meter may not accept your money.

Millions of new 5p and 10p coins could be rejected
by parking meters, vending machines and payphones across Britain... because they are slightly thicker.

The
Royal Mint is rolling out the new-sized coins from this month - and a significant number are expected to be in circulation by April.

The Royal Mint is rolling out new-sized 5p and 10p coins from this month which are slightly thicker (older coins pictured). A significant number are expected to be in circulation by April

The coins could be rejected by parking meters, vending machines and payphones across Britain

It means customers will be left fumbling through their change to
find coins that will be accepted, since some machines will no longer take the
old-style coins while others will reject the new ones. 

The new coins were
originally meant to be introduced last year, but implementation was delayed to give industry more time to make adjustments to their machinery. 

They are a cost-saving exercise for
the Government, because the current coins are made of an alloy of copper and
nickel, which has become more expensive.

The new coins, which the Royal Mint
started to produce at the beginning of January, are made of nickel-plated steel.

Neither the Royal Mint nor the Treasury would say whether the new coins are magnetic.

The old 5p is 1.7mm thick while the old 10p is 1.85mm thick.

In both instances, thickness will increase by 10 per cent.

The reason for this difference is due to 'technical issues', according the Royal Mint and Treasury.

The Government's own impact assessment of the introduction of the
new coins said the change in composition will save the Treasury between £7million and £8million a year.

However, the
cost to industry and local councils of the transition will be around £80million over
two years.

A Treasury spokesman said: 'Making new 5p and 10p coins out of nickel-plated steel
will save the taxpayer a significant amount of money.

'Many countries,
such as Canada, New Zealand and Russia, have already moved towards lower-cost
coinage as a way of reducing spending.

'The Government consulted before deciding on the change,
and the introduction of the new coins has already been delayed to allow
industry - including local councils - time to prepare.

'We also anticipate it
will take many months for the new coins to reach significant circulation
levels, giving extra time to adapt or replace machines.'

Jonathan Hilder, head of the Automatic Vending Association, said the delay had
allowed the vending industry to prepare for the new coins.

But he added that there
would be issues with accuracy as the machines would no longer be able to judge
the coins by weight. 

He added that parking meters in rural areas would be
a particular problem as these could not be easily changed, meaning that
customers would find their money rejected

'Once again, this will hit the less
well-off and rural communities,' he said. 

Jeff Wilkes, managing director
of Solitaire Payphones, said his company estimated that there were 100,000 of
its own payphones across the country that would not be able to accept the new
coins, although the rest of his company's payphones had been upgraded.

This is not the first time in recent Royal Mint history that a change in composition of coinage has occurred.

In 1992, 1p and 2p pieces were changed because the copper content was so high, the coins were worth more than their face value.
