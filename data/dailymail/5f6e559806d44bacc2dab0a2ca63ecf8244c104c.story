Dressing up, posing for photo shoots and updating fans on your goings-on is something more commonly associated with celebrities.

But that lifestyle is an every day reality for one popular pooch who just a year ago was rescued from a puppy farm.

Cavalier spaniel Lucy - who has almost 3,000 Facebook followers - was named Britain's most heroic dog at the Birmingham NEC's National Pet Show in September.

And to celebrate her title the seven-year-old is now set to star in her own calendar, which features the mutt in different outfits each month.

The 2015 calendar will hit the shops just in time for Christmas and show Lucy in a party hat celebrating her birthday month and sitting in a suitcase with a bucket and spade in the summer. 

Money raised will be split between PupAid, set up to highlight puppy farm cruelty, and Many Tears Animal Rescue.

It is an organisation close to the heart of her owner, Lisa Garner from Studley, Warwickshire, after her pooch was rescued from squalor in March 2013.

The 35-year-old, who runs a dog boutique, said: 'When I first saw Lucy, she was skin and bone and very withdrawn. She was absolutely tiny, weighing only eight pounds.

'Lucy didn't even resemble the breed. She had bald patches, stained feet from being kept on a urine-covered floor, and an arched back.

'When I first held her, it broke my heart because Lucy just wanted to get down and back into her bed.

Owner Lisa set up a Facebook page to raise awareness of puppy farming after she adopted Lucy in March 2013 and has been overwhelmed by the following they have recieved

'She still has some health problems, but the transformation over 18 months has been amazing.

'She loves everyone she meets, which is surprising when you think what she's been through.'

Since then, the hound has become an internet sensation,after her owner set up Facebook page 'Lucy The Rescue Cavalier' to raise awareness of puppy farming.

'I never imagined she'd get the following she has. She posts pictures of what she's been up to every day.

'She suffers from some health issues and she will let her Facebook friends know if she's been poorly.

'The support and love for her at difficult times is overwhelming. From being a dog with no name and no love, Lucy has brightened the lives of everyone she meets.'

And after year's of suffering the pooch is now lapping up her moment in the spotlight.

'Lucy was as good as gold during the shoot,' added Ms Garner.

'The only command she knows is "Sit", yet for March, the month I got her, she posed with a streamer in her mouth. We call that her "Gotcha!" month.

'But I don't think she could ever be a diva. She just takes things in her stride.' 

The calendars, costing around £10, will be available within the next two weeks from Lucy's Facebook page. 

Money raised from the 2015 calendar will be split between PupAid, set up to highlight puppy farm cruelty, and Many Tears Animal Rescue
