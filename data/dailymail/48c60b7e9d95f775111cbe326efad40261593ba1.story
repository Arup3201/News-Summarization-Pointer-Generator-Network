The Treasury is preparing to put further billions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash at risk under emergency plans for the break-up of the euro.

The money will be made available to the International Monetary Fund to help solve the debt crisis threatening to tip the world into the worst depression since the 1930s.

But David Cameron’s commitment at the G20 summit in Cannes to increase Britain’s £29billion IMF contribution left him facing another fight with Tory eurosceptics.

They insist Britain should not offer a penny more to bail out debt-stricken European economies – even indirectly through the IMF.

The situation in Greece, meanwhile, 
is becoming more chaotic by the minute. Last night Germany and France 
effectively blackmailed Athens into abandoning a referendum that 
threatened to bring down the single currency.

They warned Greece would be expelled from the EU if it pressed ahead.

There were even claims that Europe’s 
big two had gone behind Mr Papandreou’s back and directly contacted the 
Greek opposition about how to crush the referendum and get the euro 
rescue agreed – a move likely to prompt claims of a Brussels-inspired 
‘coup’.

George Papandreou is still clinging on as prime minister and trying to stitch together a national unity government.

Constantine Michaelos of the Athens Chamber of Commerce said last night that ‘nobody’ was running the country.

Amid increasing signs that 
preparations are being made for a Greek exit from the eurozone, Jean 
Claude Juncker, the president of the currency grouping, said: ‘We are 
working on the subject of how to ensure there is not a disaster for the 
people in Germany, Luxembourg, the eurozone.

Debt-riddled Portugal last night demanded softer terms for its £67billion bailout.

Portuguese prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho said he wanted to negotiate a more flexible deal to help the economy recover from recession.

The move will alarm leaders in other European countries amid fears that Greece is on the verge of collapse and the crisis could spread to larger economies such as Italy and Spain.

But Mr Passos Coelho insisted that Lisbon has no intention of watering down its commitment to lower its debts and implement hard-hitting reforms to boost growth.

Portugal was the third eurozone country to need a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund following Greece and Ireland.

With the economic and political crisis in Greece threatening to bring the country down, European leaders will be desperate to prevent a re-run in Portugal.

British taxpayers have stumped up around £12.5billion to support the three countries and save the single currency.

Portugal was forced to accept a £67billion bailout six months ago as fears over its towering debts and ailing economy drove its interest rates to unaffordable levels.

In exchange for the money, Portugal agreed to harsh austerity measures that now threaten to choke off the growth needed to climb out debt.

Mr Passos Coelho said Portugal does not need more bailout money but ‘more flexible conditions to implement the programme, not a new programme’. He did not specify what changes he is seeking.

‘We are absolutely prepared for the 
situation. We are absolutely prepared for the situation which I describe
and which I want to be avoided.’

But as fears grew that Italy’s 
‘basket-case’ economy is weeks away from meltdown, Chancellor George 
Osborne said the Treasury was preparing for ‘all contingencies’.

In the Commons, Treasury minister 
Mark Hoban went further, declaring: ‘I don’t think there’s any intention
for us to join the euro at a time when it is breaking up.’

China has rebuffed humiliating 
requests for it to contribute to the £880billion eurozone rescue fund 
announced to great fanfare in Brussels last week, but which quickly 
turned out to have no new money committed to it.

However China does appear ready to 
boost its shareholding in the IMF, which makes loans to beleaguered 
economies and imposes austerity measures on them in return.

Britain is prepared to increase its 
£29billion commitment toward the IMF’s total firepower of £600billion 
and led calls for a massive increase in its resources.

Diplomatic sources said they expected
the fund to be increased by hundreds of billions in a deal that could 
be unveiled as early as today.

The Prime Minister said: ‘When the 
world is in crisis, it is right that you consider boosting the 
International Monetary Fund, an organisation founded by Britain in which
we are a leading player.

‘No government ever lost money by 
lending to the IMF that supports countries right around the world. But 
what we wouldn’t support is the IMF investing directly in some euro 
bailout fund.

‘That wouldn’t be right and we won’t 
back it.’ Mr Osborne said the G20 negotiations were getting down to the 
‘nitty gritty of numbers’.

Asked why British money should be put
at risk to help bail out eurozone countries, Mr Osborne said that 
taxpayers from around the world, including those in America and China, 
would be ‘exposed’.

He also pointed out that even if a 
country ends up being unable to repay any of its other debts, it will 
still have to pay the IMF.

The Chancellor said he had been 
proposing an increase in IMF resources for several months, and insisted 
the eurozone must proceed with its own rescue plan outlined last week, 
which includes writing off 50 per cent of Greece’s debts and 
recapitalising vulnerable banks.

A ‘Robin Hood’ tax on bankers across Europe would cost Britain more than £25billion and ‘cripple’ the fragile economy, a report warns today.

Plans by French president Nicolas Sarkozy to introduce a levy on financial transactions would hit the UK harder than anywhere else and ‘ruin the City of London’, according to the Adam Smith Institute.

The report says the tax would wipe out the London-dominated market for derivatives, a type of complex financial investment, and drive business overseas.

Pressure is mounting on David Cameron and George Osborne to agree to the tax to help resolve the global economic crisis and tackle poverty and climate change.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates yesterday threw his weight behind the tax, which has also been backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

But Downing Street is opposed unless the tax is global, and has pledged to veto any attempt to introduce it across the EU. Mr Osborne says the ‘necessary international consensus does not exist’ to impose the tax.

But Tory rebels were last night 
threatening to try to force a Commons vote – raising the prospect that 
they could combine with Labour MPs to defeat the government.

When Parliament last voted to 
increase Britain’s contribution, 32 Tories defied a three-line whip to 
vote against the government.

If more of the 81 Euro-rebels who 
defied Mr Cameron by supporting an EU referendum last month signed up, 
the coalition could crash to a humiliating defeat.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: 
‘Ministers need to level with the British people and tell them the truth
– the Government wants to send even more British money to the IMF to 
bail out euro basket cases.’

Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘There will 
have to be another vote. Greece can’t solve its economic problems while 
it’s in the euro. If it came out I would support IMF money being used 
because Greece could devalue its currency and rebuild but, while it 
remains in, this is just a disguised bung to Euroland.’

Mark Pritchard, who helped coordinate
the 81 rebellion, said: ‘Whether it’s a direct or an indirect bailout, I
don’t think  British taxpayers should be expected to pay another penny 
towards the failing euro project.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls last night
made clear Labour would vote against another IMF handout if it ends up 
with eurozone countries: ‘The IMF’s job is to support individual 
countries with solvency crises, not to solve a structural problem caused
by eurozone countries being unable to agree the necessary steps to 
support and maintain their monetary union.’
