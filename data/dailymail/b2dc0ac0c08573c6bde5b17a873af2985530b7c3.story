Romelu Lukaku touchingly dedicated his strike against West Ham to his friend Junior Malanda, who died in a car accident on Saturday.

Wolfsburg midfielder Malanda, 20, was killed in a speeding car that skidded off the road in wet conditions in Germany.

And after Lukaku put Everton 2-1 in front during the FA Cup clash at Upton Park, he pointed to the sky in memory of his friend.

The Belgian duo lived in the same Brussels neighbourhood and their mothers are also close friends.

After being informed of the news after playing the Premier League game against Manchester City,  Lukaku tweeted a series of emotional messages including: 'I love you my brother.'

The accident is now the subject of a manslaughter probe after it emerged Malanda was not wearing a seatbelt.

The Belgium Under 21 midfielder played against Everton in the Europa League in November, and was tipped to have a bright future in the game.
