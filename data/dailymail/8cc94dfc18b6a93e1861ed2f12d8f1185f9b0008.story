Police used batons and tear gas to stop Ukrainian demonstrators from storm the main government building in Kiev today.

The ugly scenes followed the biggest rally since the Orange Revolution nine years ago as more than 50,000 people demanded closer ties with the European Union.

Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign a pact with the EU last week and opposition leaders allege the decision was dictated by Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Tens of thousands of protesters attended the rally in Ukraine yesterday calling for closer ties with the EU after President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign a landmark pact last week

After the main rally a group of around 100 activists tried to storm the main government building in Kiev but were forced back by riot police using batons, tear gas and sound grenades

The Kremlin is calling for Ukraine to join a Russian-led Customs Union, and has threatened trade sanctions if it does not.

Police estimated the rally attracted 23,000 protesters, while opposition groups estimated they had hit their 100,000 target.

While the main rally, during which people waved flags and banners which read 'We are not the Soviet Union, we are the European Union' and 'I Love EU', passed off peacefully, a hardcore of activists then took their anger to the government building.

The main square was turned into a sea of Ukrainian and EU flags while protesters chanted pro-Europe slogans

Despite protesters trying to force their way inside the building there were no arrests and police did not try to break the demonstration up

The demonstrations were the largest since the Orange Revolution in 2004, also against Viktor Yanukovych, after allegations that he rigged the election. The race was eventually re-run and he lost, but then won again in 2010

Several hundred people had to be forced back by police using batons, tear gas and sound grenades, though there were no arrests and the rally was not broken up.

Opposition leaders have now called for the protesters to stay overnight and have set up tents in Independence Square, though it is unclear how many have remained.

Elsewhere during the two-hour demonstration jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko issued a statement which was read by her daughter, Eugenia

In it she urged people to keep protesting to 'force Yanukovych to change his humiliating decision' and sign up to a pact with the EU.

Eugenia also sung the national anthem alongside opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk as they encouraged protesters to stay overnight to show their support for the cause

Protesters have set up camp in the centre of Kiev as temperatures in the capital near freezing point

Demonstrations calling for closer ties with Europe have continued into the evening with more clashes with police

'Don't let him humiliate us all in this way,' she added.'It's our road map to a normal life.'

The protesters responded with chants of 'Freedom to Yulia' and 'Down with the gang,' referring to Yanukovych's government.

Tymoshenko has been in jail since 2011 on abuse of power charges which she says were ordered in a vendetta by Yanukovych, and which the West believes were politically motivated.

earlier in the day angry activists had shouted 'revolution' while they scuffled with riot police

In the cities of Lviv and Sevastopol protesters also gathered to mimic the demonstrations in Kiev (pictured)

Opposition party UDAR claim that their leader Vitali Klitschko, the boxing champion, was prevented from attending the rally after his plane was denied permission to land in Kiev.

He was instead forced to land in another airport much further away, after returning from meetings in Europe.

Protests also spread across the country, including to the Western city of Lviv where 10,00 people gathered, and also to Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula where the Russian navy is stationed.

President Yanukovych held secret talks with Russia earlier in the month leading to allegations that he is a puppet of the Kremlin and acting on orders from President Putin

Opposition leaders claimed o have hit their target of 100,000 demonstrators, while police put the number at 23,000

There pro-Western and pro-Russian demonstrators clashed in the centre, leading to police closing off several streets.

The Orange Revolution took place in 2004 against the current President, Viktor Yanukovych, after allegations of widespread vote rigging in an election which he won.

Thousands of people took to the streets each day until, under international pressure, the race was eventually re-run with the initial loser, Viktor Yushchenko, being declared victor with 52 per cent of the vote.

Yanukovych won the next election in 2010, however, after a watchdog said he had conducted it fairly.
