Julius has a mansion made from other men's trash, which he treats like his treasure, and the pensioner plans to vigorously defend his 'castle' in the world's top human rights court.

The Wollongong resident has been at battle with his local council for 40 years, fighting hard to keep his collection of anything and everything, A Current Affair revealed.

But the four-decade long scrap over what some would call a scrap heap has escalated from local scuffle to international human rights case, with Julius set to front The Hague with his defence.

Wollongong resident Julius has a huge collection of mismatched items in his backyard and is in an ongoing fight with the council to keep everything, including his car motors pictured

Julius boasts 25 bikes, three cars, two car motors, 36 whipper-snippers, a bunch of TVs, 12 fridges, a disabled bathroom, and a trampoline - and that's just the beginning of his collection that to anyone else may look like a collection of items carelessly dumped in the backyard.

He calls one section of the 'resort' a day spa, which includes a large swimming pool, sauna and various massage apparatus. In one spot, there's even a four tonne forklift holding up part of the roof.

The council wants most of it gone, though the former chemistry teacher claims to have a 20-year-old document in which he was given approval to keep his resort of rubble.

So far he has lost cases in the Land and Environment Court, the Supreme Court of NSW, been dismissed from the High Court of Australia and now wants to take it to International Court of Justice in the Netherlands.

'It's a basic infringement of civil rights, of human rights... so that's why I think it should fall under the jurisdiction of the international court,' he told the program.Â

The mansion of mess sits behind Julius' house, and his wife has been by his side through the whole ordeal.

She insists they aren't hurting anybody, and neighbours say that despite it being a little eccentric, the vast collection of mismatched junk doesn't bother them.

Julius is so passionate about keeping his collection that he even served a short amount of time in Long Bay Jail a few years ago for refusing to get rid of the sauna.

'It's everything I've got, it's what I live for, it's a hobby and if it doesn't hurt anyone why should they come in and take it all down the dump?'

The passionate pensioner and his wife have been given six months to remove some of the rubbish or they will step in, and the couple have chained themselves to the chambers on multiple occasions to protest their decision.

Julius insists that he's entitled to enjoy his own time in his own space, and won't stop until Wollongong Local Council recognises that.
