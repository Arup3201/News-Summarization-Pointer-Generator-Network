'There were legal ways.....and there were illegal ways,’ says PI

A private investigator jailed last year for paying a ‘blagger’ to steal bank details has revealed that his biggest clients were insurers at Lloyd’s of London.

John Spears, a former Metropolitan Police detective, is one of four ‘rogue’ private detectives whose clients form the basis of a secret list of 102 blue-chip companies and law firms held by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca).

But in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, the 73-year-old investigator has dropped a heavy hint as to who is on the list, saying he was employed by three international law firms based in the City of London, who in turn were working for underwriters on Lloyd’s market.

Spears, who served three months of an eight-month sentence after being convicted last year, said the underwriters would regularly ask him directly, or through lawyers, to carry out ‘financial investigations’  to assess the value of individuals and companies.

Law firms who employed him included Herbert Smith Freehills, Richards Butler (now known as Reed Smith) and Clyde & Co.

In most cases, Spears says, the enquiries were ‘entirely above board’.

A lawyer working for the firm representing phone hacking victims hired private detectives who used unlawful methods to obtain sensitive information.

Dan Morrison was a partner and asset-tracing specialist at Mishcon de Reya, where he was praised for his ‘aggressive approach to his cases’.

In 2006 he instructed a detective agency, Carratu, to investigate the assets of businessman David Hughes.

Mishcon was acting for a firm that had given Mr Hughes a loan and wanted to check his financial position.

Unknown to Mr Morrison, Carratu passed some of the work to ‘enquiry agents’ Sharon and Stephen Anderson who ‘blagged’ confidential information about Mr Hughes.

His bank account details were found at the couple’s address.They later pleaded guilty to more than 50 charges of obtaining information contrary to the Data Protection Act.

Mr Morrison left Mishcon in 2011 and was replaced in effect by Charlotte Harris.

There is no suggestion the firm, or Mr Morrison, was involved in, or aware of, any illegal activity.

Mishcon cut ties with Carratu after it emerged the Andersons had acted unlawfully.

Last night Miss Harris, who represented many of the Hacked Off victims, said: ‘I have never worked on a fraud investigation. I have no knowledge of this case.’

But sometimes he sub-contracted work to Dan Summers, identified in court as a ‘blagger’, who obtained sensitive information illegally.

Spears and Summers, 33, were jailed last year following a Soca investigation and are at the heart of what is now known as the ‘blue-chip’ hacking scandal.

The case prompted Soca to compile the secret list of names linked to the four private eyes but, despite protests from MPs, it has so far refused to release it.

Soca claims it might jeopardise current and future Met investigations.

The list was surrendered to Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee late 
last month, but only on the strict condition that it was kept under lock
 and key and not shown to the public.

The agency said it has shared all its material with police, but Labour MP Keith Vaz claims below that argument was undermined when it was revealed that it only handed the list to Scotland Yard last Tuesday night.

The Met said last night that Soca had been co-operating with them in handing over ‘huge quantities of electronic data from the investigation’.

And a Soca spokesman said the Met had been provided with full access to 
all material held by Soca, adding: ‘The operation team involved in the 
preparation of the list requested that client information relating to 
their ongoing investigation be removed prior to its release to the 
committee.’

Spears was jailed after admitting asking Summers to obtain personal data illegally.

Summers declined to comment yesterday after retreating to Cyprus with his family.

Spears said Summers could ‘look at bank records... and find out if there were any payments going through’.

He added: ‘You rang someone who you knew could obtain financial information. How they obtained it, one never knew. There were legal ways of obtaining it, and there were illegal ways.’

Spears believes the three law firms he has named and the Lloyd’s syndicate are on the list of names Soca compiled.

The Mail on Sunday put a series of questions to Lloyd’s as well as the three law firms named by Spears. Lloyd’s said: ‘We are not going to give you a response’, while Herbert Smith Freehills and Richards Butler declined to comment.

Clyde & Co said after undertaking investigations it had ‘found nothing to support the allegations’.

Comment: By Keith Vaz; Labour MP and chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee

The Home Affairs Select Committee concluded its first report into private investigators exactly one year ago.

It followed public anger at the activities of some PIs who had broken the law to provide services to their clients in the newspaper industry.

At that stage, it was perceived to be a media problem, although it now has become apparent that it was much more widespread.

The use of PIs who have been engaging in criminality with impunity was shockingly rife as confirmed by the categories of individuals, organisations and firms in the Serious Organised Crime Agency’s secret list.

Our report made several recommendations, principally the adoption of a regulatory system.

It is normal practice that governments respond to Select Committee Reports within three months, but there has been a surprising dragging of feet and a strange silence from ministers.

This week I was pleased to see  the Home Secretary at last announce her intention to bring in the regulation of PIs.

In his inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson was asked to focus solely on the press. All major political parties have accepted his conclusions.

The Prime Minister has reconfirmed his wish to extend the inquiry into a second part, primarily looking at the police.

This cannot go ahead until criminal proceedings have concluded. The time taken by Leveson’s inquiry, its limited scope and the delayed response fuels the need for an all-encompassing second inquiry.

The focus should also be on all those that have used PIs, not just the press and police.

It is remarkable that organisations and individuals, who operate in industries which can affect your freedom, review companies’ accounts, or even appear in the pages of celebrity magazines, have been employing PIs who have been convicted of criminal activity.

The clients involved are so diverse that this controversy has the potential to become even more serious than the examples shown in the first Leveson Inquiry.

Following a formal request, Soca provided us with two lists of 102 names. In sending this information, Soca decided to classify it.

Extended scope: The time has come to start Leveson part two and cast the net wider than the narrow remit of the press. Above, Lord Justice Brian Leveson

This prevented its publication. If we cannot publish the lists, they will remain locked up gathering dust.

The only way to test the reasoning behind keeping the lists confidential is by establishing the likelihood and timescale of any new investigations.

I was therefore very surprised to have received in the past 24 hours a letter from Met Police Commander Neil Basu informing me that Soca gave the lists to the Met only 96 hours ago.

In other words, Soca had not even handed the lists to the Met until after we announced the publication of the categories on the list on Wednesday last week.

Soca has not acted with the urgency that this matter deserves.

This is even more puzzling considering the joint statement released on July 12 by Soca and the Met which stated that ‘the (Metropolitan Police Service) has been given full access to all material held by Soca’.

Clearly this was not the case. It is amazing these lists were held by Soca without the police being told. 

Soca appears to have had the information on these lists for years and not acted upon it. Soca should review the classification on these documents and reconsider their objection to publication.

In just nine weeks, Soca as a stand-alone organisation will be abolished and then form part of the new National Crime Agency. This is an excellent opportunity to clear its in tray.

More than this, we need to get on and start the process for Leveson Part Two with an extended scope that goes beyond what the Prime Minister announced.

Without action now, there is a danger that matters will drag on for years, or worse still, be buried for good. That would be an affront to our democracy.
