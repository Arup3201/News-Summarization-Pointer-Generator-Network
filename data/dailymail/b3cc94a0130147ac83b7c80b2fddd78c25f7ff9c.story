Buying a house with fixtures and fittings included usually means you get the light switches, maybe the fridge and freezer and a television if you're lucky.

But with this stunning £48million Regency home in London's Regent’s Park, you get a whole lot more.

Thrown in - providing you can pay the extra £3million - is a stunning collection of artworks hanging on the walls.

The collection, put together by developer Oakmayne Bespoke to help sell the six-bedroom house, includes two works by LS Lowry.

Pricey: Lethbridge House, opposite Regent's Park, is on sale for £48million plus £3million for the artwork

There is also a vast painting of orchids by Marc Quinn, best known for his sculpture Alison Lapper Pregnant which once occupied the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square.

Meriam Makiya, a partner at agents Knight Frank, which is selling the stucco-fronted house, said that the tycoons and oligarchs who are potential buyers are 'very time poor' and valued an expert selecting an art collection for them.

She added: 'Art is the obvious thing that turns a property into a home and gives it an element of a personal touch. At this level it’s all emotional and that’s what the art adds to the property.'

Buyers are handed an art catalogue detailing the 32 works scattered around the house, as well as the normal brochure, when they view.

It is claimed to be the first time an art collection of a quality that might be found in a major gallery has been used as a deliberate sales ploy for a London house.

The most expensive single work is Lowry’s 1938 The Coal Barge hung in the drawing room of Grade I-listed Lethbridge House, part of John Nash's Cornwall Terrace.

It is described in the catalogue as 'an exceptionally evocative painting' that is for sale for £1.4million. The other Lowry, the Ferry South Shields, is valued at £500,000.

The work by Quinn called Arctic Fox Grounds of Hampstead Heath has a £360,000 price tag.

Meanwhile, the cheapest work is an 'ink on silk' print Seeing the Unseen by YooJin Jung priced at £2,400.

The house also has a swimming pool, gym, steam room, cinema and ballroom.
