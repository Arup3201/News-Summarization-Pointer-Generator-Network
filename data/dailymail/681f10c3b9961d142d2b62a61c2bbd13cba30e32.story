Tom Hanks, who appeared alongside 
Meg in several of Ephron's films, put his 56th birthday celebrations on 
hold for the ceremony.

Director
Steven Spielberg, Mad Men star Jon 
Hamm, actresses Sally Field and Shirley McClaine and comedians Steve Martin, Martin Short and Larry David were also among the 
mourners.

Industry veterans Bette Midler, Regis
Philbin, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer and Martha Stewart attended 
along with Matthew Broderick and Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth.

A brilliant writer and humorist: Ephron is famous for penning romantic comedies

Julie and Julia star Meryl Streep is understood to have been at the gathering, but was not photographed.

Frank Sinatra's classic I've Got the World on a String was among the songs played during the service, which Ephron had planned down to the last moment prior to her death.

She had selected the song list, chosen who would speak and had stipulated that the service be finished in under 47 minutes.

Ephron
passed away in a New York hospital on June 26 from 
pneumonia brought on by acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 71.

She leaves behind her third husband Nicholas Pileggi, and two sons Jacob and Max from her second marriage.

Stars were quick to pay tribute in the wake of her death.

'Nora was an era,' Meg wrote in a poetic statement.

'We pictured ourselves inside her 
dreams and they became ours,' she continued. 'All wisdom, wit and 
sparkle lights, what a treat she was, what a bless. I marvel again and 
again, what a life... to have created a simple happiness in people, to 
have added to the sum of delight in the world.'

Billy
Crystal, who also starred in When Harry Met Sally said: 'I am very sad 
to learn of Nora's passing. She was a brilliant writer and humorist.

'Being her Harry to Meg's Sally will always have a special place in my heart. I was very lucky to get to say her words.'

Emotional day: Bette Midler, Sally Field and Shirley MaClaine arrived at the service

Industry stalwarts: Martha Stewart, Diane Sawyer and Barbara WaltersÂ  also paid their respects

Tom Hanks, Meg's co-star in You've Got
Mail and Sleepless in Seattle, said Ephron 'knew what was important to 
know; how things really worked, what was worthwhile, who was fascinating
and why.'

Three-time Oscar nominee made her 
playwriting debut in 2002 with Imaginary Friends and co-wrote 2008's 
off-Broadway play adopted from the book Love, Loss, and What I Wore.

Nora had a 
penchant for romantic comedies, penning iconic scripts and most recently
worked on Julie & Julia in 2009.

Committed to her work until the end, Ephron was working on a new play, entitled Lucky Guy, at the time of her death.

A lead producer of the stage work, 
Colin Callender, said he is 'committed' to getting the piece - a 
biography of a newspaper columnist - on a Broadway stage despite her 
passing.

Callender said his team 'can think of
no more fitting tribute to her extraordinary writing and remarkable 
body of work' than to proceed with plans to produce Ephron's play.

In a statement released after her death,
he said: 'We are honored to be part of her legacy and remain committed 
to seeing her magnificent work Lucky Guy' shine on Broadway.'

Day of mourning: Al Franken, left, Paul Simon, front right, and Lorne Michaels, back right, were also at the service

Remembrance: Joy Behar, left, and Diane Von Furstenberg, right, with her husband, Barry Diller, exit the service

Lucky Guy follows the story of tabloid reporter Mike McAlary, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 for his coverage on the New York City police brutalization of Abner Louima. McAlary died that same year of colon cancer at age 41.

When word of the potential production first surfaced this spring, Tom Hanks was reported to be in negotiations to play McAlary next year on stage.

No new timetable has been revealed or whether Hanks or potential director George C Wolfe were still attached to the project.
