Figure skating legend Brian Boitano has opened up about his decision to come out as gay ahead of the Sochi Olympics - as Today show host Matt Lauer told him he wasn't that surprised.

The 1988 Olympic gold medalist spoke out two weeks after his announcement, which was sparked by his inclusion in the 
presidential delegation to Sochi, where Russia's anti-gay laws will be in effect.

'When the president announced the 
delegation and I read in the news what his message was - of tolerance - I
 thought I had to take this opportunity,' he said on Thursday morning.

'I’ve always wanted to represent my country as best I could, and I knew that I had to go past my comfort zone and reveal a private side of my life that I’ve never done before because I felt that the message is so strong.'

But he added that he feels the delegation - which includes two other openly gay athletes - needs to be cautious about how they present their message in Russia.

'I think we have to be careful when we go over there,' he said. 'The message is already being made by the delegation... I think that speaks volumes.'

Matt Lauer, who was interviewing Boitano, commended the decision, adding: 'Please don't take this the wrong way but I wasn't shocked.'

Smiling, Boitano responded: 'I never thought that I 
would be coming out in this way, and in a matter of 10 hours, I decided 
to do it.

Private life: Brian Boitano, seen on the ice in 1994, publicly came out as gay in last month

'That was what was
 right for me at this time, so I tell everybody that I think that they 
should do what’s right for them at their correct time.'

He added: 'I've 
always been a private person. I've never been ashamed of who I was. I 
intend to be a private man, just now a private gay man.'

In addition to his gold medal from the 
Calgary Olympics in 1988, Boitano also came in sixth place in the 1994 
games and is a two time World Champion.

He
 came out last week, writing: ‘I am many things: a son, a brother and 
uncle, an athlete, a cook, an author and being gay is just one part of 
who I am.

‘First and foremost I am an American 
athlete and I am proud to live in a country that encourages diversity, 
openness and tolerance. I hope we can remain focused on the Olympic 
spirit which celebrates achievement in sport by peoples of all nations.’

He
 had never addressed his personal life before the announcement, but said
 he felt compelled to do so in light of the Sochi Games.

‘It
 has been my experience from competing around the world and in Russia 
that Olympic athletes can come together in friendship, peace and mutual 
respect regardless of their individual country’s practices,’ he wrote.

Boitano will be one of three openly 
gay athletes who will be traveling to Russia as part of the delegation, 
which President Obama is sending in his place as neither he nor Michelle
 or Vice President Joe Biden will be attending.

Biggest name: Billie Jean King, who President Obama awarded the Medal of Freedom in 2009, will be a part of the team to Sochi and attending the opening ceremonies

This is the first time since 2000 that
 the U.S. will not send a president, former president, first lady or 
vice president to the Games. The White House said Obama's schedule will not permit him to attend the Games.

France and Germany are among the other countries who will not send their presidents to Sochi for the Games.

The other two open 
athletes who are part of the American delegation are tennis star Billie 
Jean King, who Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, 
and hockey player Caitlin Cahow.

Ms
 King, who said she was ‘deeply honored’ to be included, will be 
attending the opening ceremonies while Ms Cahow will attend the closing 
ceremony.

Open: Hockey player Caitlin Cahow is also a lesbian and will be attending the Sochi games

'I am equally proud to stand with the members of the LGBT community in support of all athletes who will be competing in Sochi and I hope these Olympic Games will indeed be a watershed moment for the universal acceptance of all people,' said King.

Russia has come under fierce criticism for passing national laws banning 'gay propaganda.'

Though the White House did not specifically address the Russian laws in making its announcement, spokesman Shin Inouye said the delegation 'represents the diversity that is the United States' and that Obama 'knows they will showcase to the world the best of America - diversity, determination and teamwork.'

Earlier this fall, skier Bode Miller was one of the few American athletes to speak out against the Russian law, calling it 'absolutely embarrassing'.
