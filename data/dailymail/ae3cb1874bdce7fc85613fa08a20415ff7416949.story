A holiday turned to horror yesterday when a coach full of elderly tourists overturned in strong winds and careered down an embankment at a beauty spot.

More than 20 people were injured - five seriously - as the bus left the main A83 road at the Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll, did a 360 degree roll, and narrowly avoided plunging into Loch Restil.

The coach was taking a party of 32 pensioners from Kent back to their hotel after a day trip when it suddenly veered off the road shortly after 2pm.

Five people were seriously injured after a coach carrying elderly tourists veered off the A83 near Argyll, Scotland, today before rolling down the embankment

The coach, which left a deep gash in the ground after the accident, was just feet from plunging into Loch Restil when it came to a stop (pictured)

It is not thought any other vehicles were involved in the crash, which happened in an area notorious for its freak high winds. 

Firefighters armed with cutting equipment had to remove one side of the bus in order to free the passengers trapped inside.

Police said a Royal Navy helicopter was scrambled from HMS Gannet to take five casualties to Southern General Hospital in Glasgow and the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.

All have serious injuries, including suspected spinal injuries, which are not thought to be life-threatening.

A Lossiemouth RAF helicopter was also on the ground after flying a mountain rescue team to the scene with a winch man paramedic. 

A further 25 people were described as 'walking wounded' and were taken to a makeshift rest centre at the 'Three Villages Hall' in the nearby town of Arrochar.

One horrified onlooker, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It's incredible no one died.

'The bus came down a steep embankment and came to rest very close to the loch. The bus was literally half a metre from the water.

'If it had gone a bit further, it would have been a completely different scenario.

'When I was at the scene, all the windows were broken and the curtains were flying in the wind.

'I don't know what caused the crash, but it is very, very windy. You can hardly stand still.'

The A83 was still closed several hours after the accident and a lengthy diversion had been set up along the A82.

A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said it had sent 'multiple resources' to the incident, including a Special Operations Team, an air ambulance helicopter and two emergency medical retrieval teams, who worked alongside the police and fire crews from Lochgilphead, Arrochar and Inveraray.

The coach, operated by Lochs and Glens Holidays, was returning from trip to Inverarayand were heading back to one of the group's seven Scottish hotels when the accident happened.

In total 20 people were injured in the accident, with another 25 being treated as 'walking wounded' by ambulance crews who arrived at the scene

A spokesman for the group refused to confirm which hotel the group were staying at, but said: 'We are providing all necessary support for those passengers

who were on board and the relatives of those who have been injured. The driver and the company are co-operating fully with the police investigation to establish the exact cause.'

By early evening, many of the passengers were still receiving treatment at the triage centre in Arrochar and a number were helped into waiting ambulances and taken to hospital.

The accident happened at a spot renowned locally for freak winds. Donald Clark, owner of The George Hotel in Inveraray, said: 'I had friends coming up an hour before the accident happened and they said it was very blustery.

'It's a dangerous spot, there have been a lot of accidents there. There was a Mercedes Sprinter van blown over about six weeks ago. 

'There is a gulley there and there is a funny wind pattern, there is a bit of a freak wind that comes, there has been a pattern of accidents there.'

He added that a road worker had told him it was believed that the wind caught the coach and blew it over the bank, where it had rolled within six metres of Loch Restil, a fresh water loch.

Local councillor Bruce Marshall said it was 'very very lucky' the outcome had not been far worse. He said: 'It's terrible. Obviously this is a very serious accident and I just hope that people all recover.

'It's in a very remote part of my ward and nobody lives there. It's in an area where the winds are very strong and might pose a risk to high-sided vehicles but the weather has been fairly good.

The Scottish ambulance service said it had sent two rescue vehicles, an air ambulance, and a Special Operations Team to the crash after being called at 2pm

The A83 was still closed several hours after the accident and a lengthy diversion had been set up

'Thank goodness the emergency services were on the scene very quickly. It will be sad for the operators and everyone involved.'

Transport Minister Derek Mackay said last night: 'Scottish Ministers have been kept fully informed of this serious incident across the afternoon and our immediate thoughts are with the passengers who have been transported to hospital.

'The emergency services have been working closely with helicopters from both Prestwick and Lossiemouth as well as mountain rescue teams and 'The A83, at The Rest and Be Thankful, remains closed to allow the investigation into what caused the accident to get underway.'

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Around 2.10pm, a coach with tourists overturned on the A83 Rest and Be Thankful. 

'It is understood that 32 people were on board of which five are believed to be seriously injured.

'They are being taken by ambulance/medivac to either the Southern or the RAH in Paisley for treatment. Twenty five people are described as 'walking wounded'. 

'Emergency Services are at the scene. The A83 is closed with local diversions in place.'
