70 mph... 90mph... 110 mph... 120 mph. 

An Iowa mom helplessly watched as the speedometer on her Kia Sorento surged forward due to a stuck accelerator, and she was left to hold on for dear life.

The mechanical malfunction on Sunday sent Lauri Ulvestad on a fast and furious, 59 mile journey down a Missouri highway in 35 minutes.

Scroll down for video.

Terrifying speed: Lauri Ulvestad (in the black SUV on the left) frantically tried to avoid other vehicles as she maneuvered her speeding SUV down Interstate 35

Squeezing by: The driver had to move into the road's shoulder under this bridge to avoid a collision

The driver somehow managed to maneuver her unstoppable SUV by weaving in
and out of traffic, swerving to avoid cars and barreling through a 
construction zone, in footage captured by state troopers.

Luckily, no injuries resulted from the fast-moving ride north on Interstate 35.

'I knew I was going to die,' Ulvestad, 47, told KCCI-TV.

'I didn't have any doubt about. I really thought I was going to die... and no matter what I did, I couldn't slow it down.'

Close call: The driver narrowly missed veering into a construction zone as she tries to steer clear of a sedan

Though her foot was not even on the accelerator, the rapid moving 
car continued on and the brakes had no power to bring the vehicle to a 
halt. 

The freakish malfunction occurred when Ulvestad was returning
to her home in Ames, Iowa after a weekend with friends in Kansas City, 
Missouri.

After she stopped for gas and returned to the road, near Bethanny, Missouri, she noticed her car speeding up.

And then the out-of-control Sorento took off.

Clear the road: Missouri State Troopers used sirens to try and clear the road for the speeding SUV

Half hour of hell: Lauri Ulvestad sped from Bethanny, Missouri to Osceola, Iowa, a 59 mile journey, in 35 minutes

Ulvestad was able to call 911 and state troopers with blaring sirens came to her aid to move traffic out of the way.

A
911 operator stayed on the phone with her during the petrifying ordeal 
and passed on advice on how to get the vehicle stopped.

But despite their best efforts, after a half hour nothing worked.

'I had a little angel that said, 'Don't drive faster than I can 
fly,'' Ulvestad told the local news station, choking up just thinking 
about those harrowing 30-minutes behind the wheel. 

'And I think that's what helped me.'

Finally, the troopers suggested she try and lift up the accelerator and push on the brake at the same time.

Relief: The 47-year-old (in red sweater) fell into the arms of an officer when her car finally started to slow down

'I did that, and it slammed me from 119 mph to like nothing. It 
slowed down enough that I jumped out, and [the car] kept going and then 
the officers went and tracked it down and unhooked the battery,' she 
said.

Footage shows Ulvestad jumping out of her vehicle and falling into the arms of an officer, overwhelmed with relief and emotion.

'I went and hugged him and said, 'I'm safe, I'm safe, I'm safe, I'm safe -- Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!''

Grateful: After the frightening ordeal Lauri Ulvestad thanked her guardian angel and the 911 operator who stayed on the line with her during the ride

After the Sunday incident, Kia Motors looked at Ulvestad's car and issued
a statement saying they cannot identify what caused the accelerator to 
stick.

'Our technicians have been unable to duplicate the issue and this appears to be an isolated incident. KMA will continue to investigate and analyze the facts of this situation and will work with the customer to resolve the matter in a timely manner,' the company said.

Investigation: Kia Motors is looking into what could have caused the malfunction but still has no answers. The South Korean automaker began producing the Sorento (pictured) in 2002

In the meantime, Kia has provided Ulvestad with alternative transportation as they study her vehicle.

The Sorento is a mid-size crossover SUV (or CUV) that has been produced since 2002 by the South Korean based automaker.

The Sorento is assembled at Kia’s first U.S. factory, located in West Point, Georgia.

Recent feedback on the vehicle has been positive, with one reviewer on Edmunds.com praising the Sorento for being 'smooth and quiet, the handling is secure and the driving position puts you at a commanding height.'
