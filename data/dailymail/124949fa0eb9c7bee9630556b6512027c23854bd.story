Some may call him 'nuts' or 'crazy' but Neil Tyagi doesn't care as he has set a $1 reserve price on his house for its Valentine’s Day auction, just for fun.

The 33-year-old  transport worker wanted his house at 230 Blacktown Road in Blacktown, Western Sydney to go out with a bang and do something memorable in the run up to its auction, deciding to call his agent and lock in the reserve price of $1.

Despite his agent telling him it was a bad idea, Mr Tyagi went ahead with his plan, claiming he wanted to do something special and believes he will make a huge profit.

'My family think I'm crazy, my wife thinks I'm nuts,' Mr Tyagi told Daily Mail Australia.

'We wanted to do something different, we wanted to do something fun that hasn't done before and for it to be memorable for someone who is buying the home.' 

Mr Tyagi said he and his wife Maria never wanted to sell the house in the first place. When their circumstances changed and they were forced to put the house up for auction, Mr Tyagi saw it as an opportunity to have some fun.

'We didn't really want to sell the property in the first place so when it came about that we did have to sell and we said we might as well do something different, something special.

The 33-year-old transport worker wanted his house in Blacktown, Western Sydney to go out with a bang and do something memorable in the run up to its auction, deciding to call his agent and lock in the reserve price of $1

The couple bought their  576 square metre house in 2004 for $300,000 and hope to sell for between $500,000 and $600,000.

While Mr Tyagi said he is slightly worried about the prospect of his four-bedroom two-bathroom home actually being whipped off the market for $1, he said he will just have to deal with it if it happens.

'I won't have a choice if it does sell for $1, we're going to have to cut our losses and let it go,' he said. 

'When it goes on the market it can go anywhere from $1 up and after that it could go for anything so really we have to leave it up to the market to decide. So why not,' Mr Tyagi said.

The father said he knows of the risks involved but believes he had a good chance of making a profit due to the booming property market. 

'There's a fair bit of buyers in the market  and we're hoping to achieve a fair price for us and for the buyers. We're not expecting something that's above market price but we're hoping we can achieve something fair.' he said.

However, Mr Tyagi's agent Raj Bhandari said he was completely shocked when his client called him asking him to set the reserve for the house at $1.

'I said noone has done it in NSW, I said mate that's not a good idea but he decided to do it anyway,' Mr Bhandari told Daily Mail Australia.

While Mr Tyagi said he is slightly worried about the prospect of his four-bedroom two-bathroom home actually being whipped off the market for $1, he said he will just have to deal with it if it happens

'He's a businessman and he believes that setting a $1 reserve will create more competition and he may achieve a higher price than what the property could sell for.'

Mr Bhandari said he hasn't slept since Mr Tyagi's bizarre request and revealed that he and his team have been working around the clock to ensure they are not 'left red-faced' following the February 14 auction. 

'I've told him it's a very high risk move but we are hopeful. We are spending a lot of money and time there,' Mr Bhandari said. 

Mr Bhandari said there has been a lot of interest in the property and they are confident they will receive the optimal price for the house.
