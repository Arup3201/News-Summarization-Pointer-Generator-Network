Today, for the first time in 13 years, whistleblowing consultant cardiologist Dr Raj Mattu can look to the future with a glimmer of hope.

After more than a decade of ‘torture’ - during which he says NHS bosses ‘tried to silence me, destroy my reputation and erase me from the face of the Earth’ - his good name was this week dramatically restored.

Bullied and then sacked by his NHS bosses after exposing the avoidable deaths of patients at his Coventry hospital, the 54-year-old heart specialist was vindicated on Thursday after a David-and-Goliath battle thought to have cost taxpayers £10million.

Suspended in 2002 after he exposed the fact that two patients had died in overcrowded bays at his hospital, Dr Mattu fell victim to what he described as a ‘heinous’ smear campaign.

He was reinstated in 2010, only to be dismissed a year later as he lay seriously ill in hospital. But his name was finally cleared this week when an employment tribunal found that Dr Mattu had been unfairly dismissed.

In a landmark judgment, the tribunal ruled that Dr Mattu had been targeted specifically by hospital managers because he’d blown the whistle on dangerous practices.

This is Dr Mattu’s first in-depth newspaper interview since his name was cleared, and what he reveals is a shocking indictment of the way the NHS is managed and the way it treats staff who speak out on behalf of patients.

He is now seeking a meeting with Health Minister Jeremy Hunt, but has this stark warning for any other health professional thinking of blowing the whistle to protect their patients.

‘Don’t do it, because the way I have been treated is nothing short of an outrage and a scandal,’ said Dr Mattu, a once world-renowned specialist who is now unemployed and doubts his medical career will ever recover.

‘Instead of listening to me, embracing what I said and working with me to improve conditions for patients, Trust managers tried to destroy me. It was a form of torture.

‘They stopped at nothing to change the focus from the patients - who were at the heart of my concerns - onto false claims about this allegedly “bad doctor” who needed to be removed.

‘They tried to shut me up and sideline me. I was marched from my office in broad daylight in front of my staff, colleagues and patients sitting in my waiting room.

‘Rather than work with me to improve patient care, they searched for reasons to discredit me, humiliate me and destroy my career. And once they’d set the wheels in motion, they were prepared to throw millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money at it.

‘I am relieved that this judgment completely vindicates me. It found I had not caused nor contributed to my dismissal; that my dismissal was inextricably linked to whistleblowing and that I had suffered directly.

‘Patients have been betrayed. Even today, there has still been no investigation into the deaths that I witnessed.’

Yesterday, a spokesperson for University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust (formerly Walsgrave Hospitals NHS Trust) said in a statement: ‘We are disappointed by the Employment Tribunal’s decision that the dismissal of Dr Mattu was unfair, given that the procedure followed by the Trust was reviewed by the Court of Appeal in March 2012 when it found in the Trust’s favour.

‘The Trust now needs to examine the Tribunal’s decision in more detail (it runs to 400 pages) to consider its grounds for appeal.

‘As a Trust, we will continue to support all our staff to raise issues of concern in our effort to provide continuous improvement in our services to patients.’

Born in Coventry, Dr Mattu graduated from University College London and has been employed by the NHS since 1984, working at a number of teaching hospitals in London and in Sheffield.

He was a heart specialist of international standing, and attracted millions of pounds in funding for research into the genetic causes of heart disease. He helped establish medical schools and says he was head-hunted by the NHS Trust in Coventry and tasked with doing the same there.

It was through his work that he met his wife Sangeeta, 41, who works for a pharmaceutical company, although the stress of the past decade has put enormous strain on both their lives.

Married in 2009, Dr Mattu’s ill-health - he suffers from an auto-immune disease - was exacerbated by the stress. ‘I am very fortunate that my wife has stood by me throughout and been a huge source of strength,’ he says.

‘We had hoped to have a family by now, and, God willing, we will have children. I hope they will have a father still able to kick a ball around in the park with them.’

Until he arrived at Coventry’s Walsgrave Hospital, Dr Mattu says that there had never been a single complaint about him.

It is a source of professional pride that the bosses who seemed so keen to be rid of him after he blew the whistle found not one incident of alleged clinical negligence to include with the 200 false allegations that they made.

These false claims included fraud, bullying, bribery and sexual impropriety - which both the General Medical Council and the police dismissed as completely unfounded.

Dr Mattu clearly remembers the day in December 1999 when a 35-year-old man who was vomiting blood died on an acute medical ward. Dr Mattu says the bay was overcrowded so that medical staff were unable to move him nearer life-saving equipment.

He believes the man’s death could have been avoided.

‘When a patient dies in such circumstances, it is very distressing and demoralising. You try to do your absolute best for the individual, even if it is just to ease their suffering if you cannot save them.

‘And I felt those patients who died in our hospital shouldn’t have died - and certainly not on that day at that time. There were five patients in a four-bed bay. If one of those patients was in trouble, then we knew we’d be in serious difficulties.

‘It was very upsetting to see that happen. The NHS has provided money to provide these services. It should not be acceptable for some manager to decide to reconfigure the beds in such a dangerous way

‘I felt I had been prevented from saving these people’s lives because some manager - without consulting the medical staff - had just decided that that is what they wanted to do.’

Dr Mattu says he and other doctors repeatedly raised concerns about the practice of putting five patients in bays designed and equipped for four, and expressed concern over the subsequent deaths.

After the Trust’s Chief Executive appeared on BBC TV in September 2001 and denied that deaths had occurred relating to the five-in-four overcrowding, Dr Mattu went public by giving his own interview to BBC News.

In February 2002, Dr Mattu was suspended and escorted off the premises pending an investigation into allegations of intimidation made by a junior doctor.

Judgment: A tribunal ruling found against managers at the Walgrave Hospital in Coventry, now University Hospital Coventry

‘That was the most awful experience of my life, being marched out by the medical director and the HR director, with two security guards behind them.’

Dr Mattu was suspended from his £70,000-a-year job on three-quarters of his salary for five and a half years. According to his solicitors, the NHS spent money, too, on a PR agency and on hiring private detectives. The suspension alone reportedly cost the trust £2.5m.

‘It is very distressing when you are prevented by non-medical people from doing what you love doing, when you feel there is so much you can give,’ says Dr Mattu, whose suspension was the longest in NHS history.

‘It is also very depressing. Quite apart from not being able to work, I was prevented from talking to anybody at the hospital, so I also felt isolated from my profession.

‘In hindsight, my mistake was to believe that there were enough good men and women in the NHS senior management and the Department of Health who would step up and say: “Stop! What you are doing to this doctor is wrong.”

‘Those people are not there. Instead, there is culture of closing ranks and persecuting any whistleblower.

‘I went into medicine because I wanted to spend the rest of my life trying to help people, care for them and possibly save lives along the way. That’s what drives me.

‘What managers do is they come in and they want to have a career in management. My impression is that it really doesn’t matter to these individuals if that’s in the NHS, banking or retail.

‘There’s been a shift in my working life from managers working alongside clinical staff to dictating from a central office how care should be delivered, which may not be in the best interests of patients.

‘And so millions of pounds which could have been better spent elsewhere have been wasted persecuting me. It is ridiculous.’

He was determined to fight to clear his name. Today, he feels he has done that. Whether his career will ever recover is another matter.

Of his future plans, he says: ‘For now, I just want to digest the tribunal ruling and spend the next year concentrating on recovering my health.’
