The widow of a businessman gunned down outside a suburban preschool in Atlanta, Georgia was charged in the slaying Thursday, accused of conspiring with the gunman who was convicted four months ago.

Andrea Sneiderman, 36, was charged with malice murder, criminal attempt to commit murder, racketeering, perjury and insurance fraud.

The case has captured a national audience ever since the woman's lover, Hemy Neuman, told jurors at the time of his trial that he was convinced that he should kill his lover's husband Russell Sneiderman by an angel in a dream who supposedly looked like actress Olivia Newton John.

Charged: Andrea Sneiderman, 36, was faces counts of malice murder, criminal attempt to commit murder, racketeering, perjury and insurance fraud relating to the murder of her husband Russell

The prosecutor declined to answer questions about the evidence against Sneiderman, but the 19-page indictment alleged that she conspired with Neuman, who was her boss at the time of the slaying.

'Neuman and Andrea Sneiderman conspired together to murder Rusty Sneiderman so that they could enjoy a life together, eliminate Neuman's debt problems and fully benefit from the assets the Sneidermans had acquired as well as the proceeds of Rusty Sneiderman's life insurance policies,' the indictment said.

The indictment also alleged Andrea Sneiderman gave Neuman her husband's schedule 'so that Neuman could kill Rusty Sneiderman.'

Sneiderman's attorneys issued a statement reiterating her innocence and promising a vigorous defense 'to ensure that Andrea is fully exonerated of these false accusations.'

Her attorneys include J. Tom Morgan, who spent 12 years as the DeKalb County district attorney.

The Sneiderman family said in a statement that Thursday's arrest brought no joy but called it 'another important step in pursuit of justice for Rusty.'

Prosecutors said they presented a case to a grand jury Thursday morning, and jurors returned the indictment less than two hours later.

When asked why prosecutors were pursuing the case now, the district attorney said: 'Now is because we are ready now. If we were ready three months ago, it would have been three months ago. If it was last year when we charged Mr. Neuman, it would have been then.'

Unusual urgings: During his trial, Neuman said that an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it, as did a demon who sounded like Barry White

Sneiderman was arrested at a home in 
Putnam County and was being held without bond. Details of an initial 
court appearance were not immediately available.

Earlier, WSB-TV aired footage of Sneiderman dressed in khaki shorts and a long-sleeve shirt surrounded by law enforcement officials as she left the house, was handcuffed and placed in a patrol car.

During Neuman's trial, prosecutors suggested Andrea Sneiderman was a 'co-conspirator' in the slaying, goading a love-struck Neuman into killing her husband, perhaps for a $2million life insurance policy.

Neuman also told mental health examiners he was visited by a demon whose voice sounded like Barry White and an angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John. The angel ordered him to fatally shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview.

Andrea Sneiderman repeatedly denied an affair and denied knowing anything about the shooting.

After the trial, Neuman's defense attorneys and Russell Sneiderman's family said they hoped that prosecutors would investigate Andrea Sneiderman in the killing.

At the time, Russell Sneiderman's brother, Steve, said the family long suspected Andrea was involved in his death, and the trial only confirmed their suspicions.
