Ben Morgan looks certain to be ruled out of the Six Nations on Sunday after it emerged the England No 8 underwent surgery on his damaged left ankle on Saturday morning.

The Gloucester star, who finished the autumn as England’s first-choice No 8 and was named QBE man of the series following a string of barnstorming displays, was injured during Friday night’s Aviva Premiership clash against Saracens and left the field on a stretcher requiring oxygen just after half-time.

It is understood the 25-year-old was taken to hospital in Gloucester and underwent surgery in the early hours of Saturday morning to repair badly damaged ligaments.

He now faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines and, although his World Cup participation is not believed to be under threat, his chances of playing in the Six Nations are ‘almost zero’.

‘Ben went under the knife soon after the game,’ said a source close to the player.

‘We’re waiting to hear the full extent of the damage but the fact he was sent for surgery so soon after the injury occurred is clearly not a good sign.’

Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys initially played down fears Morgan had broken his ankle but extensive ankle ligament damage has left England coach Stuart Lancaster needing to look elsewhere for a starting No 8 to face Wales in Cardiff on February 6.

Billy Vunipola (Saracens): Dropped during the autumn series but is back in form.

Nick Easter (Harlequins): Turns 37 this year but continues to deliver.

Thomas Waldrom (Exeter): Has scored nine tries in 12 appearances this season.

James Haskell (Wasps): Powerful ball-carrying ability and experience.

Tom Wood (Northampton): Normally on the blindside but a switch to No 8 could provide some spark.

Dave Ewers (Exeter): A possible bolter for selection who has previously been praised by Stuart Lancaster. Uncapped at international level.

Steffon Armitage (Toulon): The RFU state the France–based European Player of the Year will only be picked under ‘exceptional circumstances’.

‘When you see someone coming off on a stretcher it’s never a good sign,’ Humphreys said. A formal release is expected at some point Sunday.

With Lancaster already sweating on the fitness of first-choice centre Manu Tuilagi (groin) and tighthead prop Dan Cole (foot), he will have to embark on the final Six Nations campaign before the World Cup without a host of star performers.

England’s autumn was blighted by injury withdrawals and it looks as if history is repeating itself.

Morgan’s anticipated withdrawal is hugely significant. With 27 caps now under his belt, the 19-stone powerhouse emerged as one of England’s most effective forwards during the autumn, scoring three tries while offering scrum ballast and a constant ball-carrying threat. 

Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola - his most likely replacement - has endured a difficult season, suffering back-to-back concussions either side of the autumn series and struggling to recapture the outstanding form of the past two seasons.

The 22-year-old remains favourite to replace Morgan at the Millennium Stadium but he will need to show an improvement in form during Saracens’ upcoming European Champions Cup clashes with Munster and Clermont Auvergne over the next fortnight. He was subdued again on Friday night, despite insisting he has put his troubled autumn behind him.

‘I am going to make sure I am never again in the position I was in the autumn where I questioned my own ability,’ he said. ‘It was a tough time for me. Self-doubt started creeping in. I’d never had that before.’

The rest of England’s No 8 cupboard is not overly well stocked.

At 36, Harlequins’ Nick Easter is still a hugely influential Premiership performer while Toulon’s Steffon Armitage remains one of European rugby’s outstanding back-rowers.

But both men appear to be off England’s radar, with Armitage unavailable due to RFU policy dictating that only home-based players can be picked while Lancaster has not named Easter in a single squad since taking over from Martin Johnson in 2012.

Exeter’s Thomas Waldrom could provide similar attributes to Morgan while his heavyweight Exeter team-mate Dave Ewers has attracted plenty of attention this season. Wasps captain James Haskell has also enjoyed his best season for a number of years, although he has been starting on the openside flank alongside the hugely impressive Fijian-born No 8 Nathan Hughes.

The make-up of Lancaster’s back row has been hotly debated, with many believing captain Chris Robshaw is better suited to the blindside flank, where Tom Wood has struggled in recent months.

But with Morgan apparently one of the few names guaranteed a Six Nations start, his expected absence leaves Lancaster with even more head-scratching to do.
