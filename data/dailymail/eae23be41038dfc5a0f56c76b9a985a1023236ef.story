A former paramedic who sexually assaulted an unconscious woman in his ambulance in Connecticut has been sentenced to 3-and-a-half years in prison.

Mark Powell, 52, of North Haven was sentenced Wednesday in New Haven Superior Court.

The married father agreed to the prison time and lifetime sex offender registration when he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault in April. He will also serve 10 years' probation after his release.

His victim, who was 22 at the time of the assault, said in court that Powell was a 'monster' who sexually pleased himself at her expense, according to The New Haven Register.

Prosecutors say Powell and another paramedic responded to a Hamden party early Christmas morning in 2011 to treat an unconscious and intoxicated attendee who fell and hit her head while dancing.

The woman said she woke up in the ambulance and Powell was touching her in a sexual way.

'This was extreme, perverted behavior,' Superior Court Judge Patrick J. Clifford said as he imposed the sentence.

Powell told police he had made 'a very bad judgment call' when he touched the woman's breasts and genitals and initially said he did so in an effort to 'elicit a response or wake the female.' He previously denied touching her at all the admitted to pinching her nipple and digitally penetrating her.

On Wednesday, the victim read from a statement in court, where she was accompanied by her mother, sister and boyfriend, stating that the incident haunted her every day and had ruined Christmas for her forever.

According to the Register, she called Powell 'a coward in a professional position he used to his sexual advantage.'

On April 1, Powell pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault rather thanÂ  risk a much longer sentence if he was convicted at trial.

Prosecutors said Powell's co-worker, a female EMT, was driving the ambulance and was unaware of what was happening in the back. The pair worked for American Medical Response.

The driver, however, was greatly disturbed to find out about it later.

The victim reported the attack three days afterward after her mother encouraged her to do so.

She told police she woke during the ride when she felt her breast being rubbed and her vagina touched, according to the Register.

She said she remembered screaming for Powell to stop.

Clifford called the case 'baffling.'

'You're in a professional position of trust,' he told Powell. 'Your job is to treat, not sexually assault somebody.'

Powell didn't get a longer sentence, he said, because the EMT had no prior criminal record and cooperated with police.

Powell's lawyer, Norm Pattis, said his client's statement made the state's case and he was confused why he confessed to police.
