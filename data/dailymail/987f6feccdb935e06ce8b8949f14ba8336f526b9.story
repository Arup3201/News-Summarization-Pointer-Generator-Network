Mario Mandzukic has said he will leave Bayern Munich after the World Cup because coach Pep Guardiola's style of play does not work to his strengths - putting a host of Premier League clubs on red alert.

Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United are among the English sides believed to be monitoring the Croatia striker's situation and will take encouragement from those words.

Mandzukic was left out of the squad for Bayern's 2-0 German Cup final win over Borussia Dortmund last month as his fallout with former Barcelona manager Guardiola became clear.

The 28-year-old told Croatian newspaper Sportske Novosti: 'I met (Bayern chairman) Karl Heinz Rummenigge before the cup final and told him I wanted to leave the club.

'I've had a fantastic time at Bayern. It's a great club and I never thought I'd want to leave, and especially not at this point in time.

'But, let's be honest, I cannot play to my strengths under Guardiola's style - no matter how hard I try.

'I realised that after the 1-0 defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final first leg and, that being the case, it's best for all parties that we go our separate ways.

'Guardiola is an outstanding coach and I wish him and everyone else at the club all the best in the future.

'Bayern and the club's fans will remain the best and most emotional chapter in my career.'

Mandzukic helped Bayern win an 
unprecedented treble for a German side in his first season at the club 
under Jupp Heynckes, scoring 22 goals.

Dropped: Guardiola did not pick Mandzukic for the 2-0 German Cup final win over Borussia Dortmund

Prolific: Despite his reservations about style, Mandzukic scored 26 goals in 48 games last season

Despite returning even better figures under Guardiola - 26 goals in 48 games - rumours surfaced that the Croat was uncomfortable playing the Spaniard's tiki-taka style and preferred a more direct approach.

Mandzukic will miss the opening match of the World Cup for Croatia against hosts Brazil on Thursday through suspension after he was sent off in the second leg of November's 2-0 aggregate play-off win over Iceland.

His striking qualities are undoubted and he will have many suitors among Europe's top clubs but Mandzukic himself would not reveal where he will be moving.

He said: 'It's time for a fresh challenge but don't insist because I have nothing to say. The public will be informed when the time comes, right now I am focused solely on the World Cup.'

Success: Mandzukic won a treble and a double at Bayern under Jupp Heynckes and they Guardiola

Pressure: Guardiola came under criticism from some sections of the fans and media at the end of last season
