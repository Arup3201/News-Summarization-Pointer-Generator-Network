Models aren't the only ones being prepped, primed and pushed down the runway in New York this week, as thousands of dogs today gear up for their own moment in the spotlight.

The Westminster Kennel Club (WKC)'s 139th annual all-breed dog show started today at Manhattan's Madison Square Garden, where more than 2,700 pampered pooches will compete for the top accolade of Best in Show.

A staggering 192 breeds have entered the prestigious two-day competition, flocking from 48 states in the U.S. and from 14 countries worldwide.

The WKC, founded in 1877, is the second longest-running sporting event in the country, after the Kentucky Derby.

Golden retrievers make up the largest breed group this year, with 58 of them competing, followed by 56 Labradors, 41 French Bulldogs and 38 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

There is only one White Bull Terrier and one Norwegian Lundehund on the entry list this year.

Contrary to the popularity of Labradors, as well as Dachshunds, Dalmatians and Chihuahuas as pets, none of these breeds have ever won at WKC.

Two new breeds will enter this year's contest after they were recently formally recognized by the American Kennel Club; Coton de Tulears, of which there are 14 entrants, and Wirehaired Vizslas, of which there are four.

The Coton de Tulear - otherwise known as the 'royal dog of Madagascar' - is a small white fluffy breed which stands at around ten inches tall. Stars including Catherine Zeta-Jones and Jane Fonda have owned this breed in the past.

The Wirehaired Vizla is a rare breed of Hungarian hunting dog, of which there are only 400 registered in the U.S.

WKC's Best in Show will be determined by The Hon. David Merriam of Bonsall, California, who heads up a panel of 32 other judges.

The show will be broadcast tonight on CNBC from 8-11pm EST, and the finals will air tomorrow night on USA Network from 8-11pm EST.
