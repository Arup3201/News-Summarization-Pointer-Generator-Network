A US citizen has been shot and killed in Jamaica after being caught in crossfire between police and robbers, including the country's most wanted criminal.

The identity of the man has not been released, and few details of the incident have come to light, but it is understood shots were fired when police confronted gunmen who were trying to rob a business.

One other person was also killed and a third was injured.

The deceased American's next of kin have been informed of his death, according to Jamaica's US Embassy.

The gun fight took place in the western coastal town of Savanna-La-Mar, the main town in the parish of Westmoreland, according to Associated Press. The area is not a popular tourist destination.

The news agency said local media reported the incident, although it has not been confirmed by the Jamaican Constabulary.

It is not known if the man was shot by the gun-wielding robbers or the police.

Jamaican police did confirm however that a fugitive identified only by the nickname 'Bigga' was also shot and later pronounced dead at a hospital.

They seized a 9-mm pistol from Bigga, a man the police described as one of the parish's most wanted men. A police statement said he was wanted for crimes including murder, rape and armed robbery.

An investigation into the incident has been launched by an independent commission that reviews alleged abuses by Jamaica's security forces.

Jamaica has one of the worst records for gun crime and violence in the world. Every year there are at least 1,000 firearm homicides. In 2010 there were 1,080 firearm deaths, compared with 155 in the UK.
