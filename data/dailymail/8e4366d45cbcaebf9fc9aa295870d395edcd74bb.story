We've finally had enough of meaningless Facebook updates as new research says it's the number one habit we want people to cut out.

The study found nearly four in ten Brits want friends and family to stop updating their Facebook with 'meaningless rubbish'.

Almost a quarter also wish people would stop taking 'selfie' photos and sharing them on social networks. Men are the worst offenders being, according to the research, twice as likely to take selfies.

But it's not just online where Brits would like their friends and colleagues to change their ways.

A huge 35 per cent of the nation are fed up with hearing others continually use the word 'like' in their sentences.

That's not all, as 23 per cent of Brits shudder when they hear others cracking their knuckles.

Around 17 per cent of Brits bite their nails yet 28 per cent of us find it distracting when others do it.

The survey of 2,000 adults, by Microsoft 
search engine Bing, asked Brits about their day-to-day habits and how 
they would like others to alter their routine.

A quarter of people in the UK wish people would stop taking 'selfie' photos and sharing them on Facebook

The top bad tech habit in the UK were found to be phubbing- the act of snubbing someone by using your phone.

This
 was followed by Facebook stalking previous partners, judging people on 
their handset, photographing meals and filming gigs instead of enjoying 
them.

Brian Kealy, Head of Search at Microsoft UK, said: 'Our research reveals a huge number of British people do things out of habit.'

Around 85 per cent of Brits, admit to having at least one habit but less than half say they do it daily.

However, these habits are things which Brits do without even realising they're doing it.

For example, nearly half of us said we sit in the same place to have dinner at home every day.

What's more, 37 per cent of Brits always fold toilet paper rather than scrunching it.

At work, just over one in ten of us use 
the same cup at work every day while one in five always re-read an email
 three times before sending.

Not surprisingly, men and women disagreed about their partner's habits.

Over half of women would like their man to change a habit with 17 per cent wanting them to stop leaving the toilet seat up.

But considering these could be habits of a lifetime, 90 per cent of Brits are prepared to change if it provided them with new experiences.

Professor Kevin Dutton, an expert in the science of social influence, said: 'We all do daily things in a habitual way without thinking.

'In fact, a lot of the time we "sleep-walk" through our daily lives.

'Even the most obvious habits show a desire for order but we'd all jump at the chance to learn something new.'

Bing commissioned the research into habits as a way of promoting its Bing It On campaign.

The idea is that many people use rival search engine Google as a habit and a new site has been set up to test whether people prefer Bing or Google, and to highlight that Google may not always be best.

The Bing It On challenge shows two sets of search results for the same phrase and people are asked to choose which they prefer.
