An Australian hip hop group has received an apology after they filmed a baggage handler carelessly tossing luggage – including their instruments – onto a conveyor belt.

The instruments belonging to New South Wales trio Thundamentals were manhandled as they were loaded onto a Virgin Australia plane at Sydney Airport even though they were marked ‘fragile’.

One of the group members filmed the distressing moment from his window seat and posted a 13-second video clip on Facebook, where it has received nearly one million views, 30,000 likes and more than 2,000 shares.

A Virgin Australia spokesman says the airline is investigating the incident

The stunned musicians – DJ Morgs, MC Jeswon and MC Tuka – shouted in anguish as their instruments were flung onto the conveyor belt as they travelled to a gig in the coastal city of Coffs Harbour.

Between expletives, one of them yelled: ‘Oh, that’s my keyboard!’

In the Facebook post, the group told its fans: ‘Apologies if our equipment doesn't work for our gig tonight, doesn't seem like @virginaustralia take care when reading the "fragile" label on our instruments.’

Their fans wrote that the employee should be sacked.

A Virgin Australia spokesman told the Herald Sun that the airline has reached out to Thundamentals’ management to apologise.

The airline said in a statement: ‘We sincerely apologise to the Thundamentals for the mishandling of their luggage.’

‘Virgin Australia always endeavours to take care of our guests’ luggage and are investigating this particular incident.’
