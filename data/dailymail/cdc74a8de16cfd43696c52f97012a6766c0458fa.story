Fifi Geldof has hit out at critics of her sister Peaches in an expletive-filled online rant.

Web users attacked Peaches yesterday after an inquest found she died of a heroin overdose with her baby son in the house.

But her older sister Fifi hit back at those criticising her sibling, insisting: 'You've no idea what you're talking about'.

An inquest heard that, in April this year, Peaches died of a heroin overdose ten times bigger than the one that killed her mother Paula Yates 14 years ago.

Peaches had been looking after their 11-month-old son Phaedra, who had been left alone for up to 17 hours when her husband, Thomas Cohen, returned home.

As details of Peaches' death emerged, many went online to give their views, with some branding her irresponsible for taking drugs near her child.

But Fifi, 31, lashed out at the critics on her Instagram page, where she wrote: 'Don't keep calm and f*** this. F*** that. F*** you. F*** off', the Sun reported this morning.

She added: 'Sums it up nicely about how I'm feeling about the viciousness today. Maybe now she'll be allowed to RIP.' 

When another website user claimed her sister was 'selfish and sad' for using drugs, Fifi replied: 'You've no idea what you're talking about quite frankly. Yet another who has bought into the bulls***', the paper reported.

An inquest heard Peaches' husband Thomas Cohen found her at home surrounded by drugs paraphernalia

The inquest into Peaches death heard stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the 25-year-old’s country home.

Her husband returned from a weekend away to find her slumped dead on a bed, covered in needle puncture marks.

A used syringe was in a sweet box next to her body and a pair of knotted tights had apparently been used as a tourniquet, the hearing in Gravesend, Kent, heard earlier this week.

Peaches was also attacked on Mumsnet yesterday where one website user called her a 'toxic hypocrite' for potentially exposing her child to drugs.

Controversial wannabe model Josie Cunningham also came under fire online yesterday after she claimed Peaches' drug addiction was 'pathetic' and 'a choice'

On a thread which was later taken down, another person wrote: 'Seems like the reality was the exact opposite of how she portrayed herself.'

Mumsnet later removed the discussion, writing: 'Message from MNHQ: We don't think this kind of discussion is really in the spirit of the site so we're zapping the thread.'

Controversial wannabe model Josie Cunningham, who became famous for having a £4,800 breast enlargement op on the NHS, also attacked Peaches on Twitter, claiming her drug addiction was 'pathetic' and 'a choice'.

But Cunningham, who once claimed she would abort her unborn baby so she could take part in a TV programme, came under fire from others.

One website user asked her: 'Who are you to talk about a child's safety, you wanted to f*****g abort your unborn child, you utter cretin.'
