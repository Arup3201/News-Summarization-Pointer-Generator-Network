Katy Perry's new album Prism has been declared a potential biohazard in Australia over fears seeds contained within the packaging may pose a risk to wildlife.

The deluxe version of the album contains a small packet of flower seeds which the US singer has encouraged fans to grow to 'spread the light'.

Perry's production company has assured the country's Department of Agriculture (DA) that the Australian release contains only locally sourced seeds - those of the Swan River daisy - which are not a threat to the ecosystem.

But biosecurity officials say international versions of the CD bought online still pose a risk because they may not contain seeds native to the country.

Danger to wildlife? Katy Perry's new album Prism has been declared a potential biohazard in Australia because international versions may contain seeds that are not native to the country

During her recent live performance on the TV breakfast show Sunrise outdoors at the Sydney Opera House, Perry said she wanted fans to grow the daisies from seeds to give them something beautiful.

A spokesman for the DA said officers will now be on high alert for any foreign albums coming through customs.

He said: 'Seeds or plant material of international origin may be a weed not present in Australia or the host of a plant pathogen of biosecurity concern.'

Australia has some of the strictest quarantine measures in the world to protect human health, the environment and agricultural industries, which make up a fifth of the national economy.

The introduction of exotic pests and diseases could have disastrous effects for the country.

For example, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade estimates that a major outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease could cost the economy as much as $13billion.

Other threats include the Khapra beetle, the Giant African snail, the Asian gypsy moth and the fungal disease Karnal bunt which can all ravage wildlife.

Inquiries are being made about the origins of seeds in international versions of the CD, which is currently number one in Australia and a worldwide hit.

The spokesman added: 'The Australian Government has a strong system in place to detect and respond to material of biosecurity concern.

'This includes inspection of mail, cargo and baggage.'

Australian consumers spent an estimated $6.2billion (3.6bn) on goods over the internet last year.

Perry recently overtook Justin Bieber to become the most-followed person on Twitter.

The Roar hitmaker's follower count surpassed that of the 20-year-old singer over the weekend and as of Monday Perry had 46,529,048 to Justinâ€™s 46,507,582.
