India's stand-in test captain Virat Kohli scored 66 and Murali Vijay added 60 as the tourists played out a draw in the two-day match against a Cricket Australia Chairman's XI that concluded on Friday.

The match was organized on short notice to give the Indian players some much-needed match practice ahead of the first test against Australia which begins Tuesday at the Adelaide Oval.

The four-test series had initially been due to begin in Brisbane this week but had been rescheduled following the death of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes.

Playing at the Glenelg Oval in suburban Adelaide, the Australian team batted first and scored 243 while India replied with 375 in its first innings. The Chairman's XI was 83-5 in its second innings at stumps Friday.

Vijay and Kohli, who both retired to give other batsmen time in the crease, shared a 123-run stand, steadying India's innings after the visitors were 36-2 late on the opening day.

Vijay took one bouncer on the body that flicked up and hit the helmet, but composed himself quickly. 

Hughes died last Thursday, two days after being hit in the head from a short-pitched delivery during a domestic first-class match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
