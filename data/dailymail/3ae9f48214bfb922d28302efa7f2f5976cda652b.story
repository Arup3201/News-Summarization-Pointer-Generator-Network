Will Mauricio Pochettino lead Spurs into the Champions League next season?

The hard work starts here for Mauricio Pochettino.

Firing Tottenham into the Champions League positions next season will be no mean feat.

But truth be told, the Argentine has already overcome a sizeable task in becoming Daniel Levy's latest managerial acquisition.

The potential appointment of Ajax manager Frank de Boer was the prospect that really got Tottenham supporters' mouths watering.

When the Dutchman publicly revealed 
Tottenham's interest in him last month, it seemed the start of the road 
towards De Boer's appointment.

In fact, it was the beginning of the end of his chances of replacing Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane.

Dawn of a new era? Mauricio Pochettino has signed a five-year-deal to become Tottenham manager

In the dugout: Pochettino resigned from Southampton on Tuesday to join the White Hart Lane outfit

Second best: Ajax manager Frank de Boer was also in the running for the Tottenham job

Levy insists on private club business staying private, particularly when it concerns something as delicate as a managerial appointment.

De Boer's decision to go public with Spurs' interest riled certain figures at White Hart Lane, and, ironically, worked in Pochettino's favour.

As Sportsmail revealed, Carlo Ancelotti was always Levy's dream managerial choice.

But the chances of luring the Italian away from Real Madrid looked remote at best.

Decision maker: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has appointed three Tottenham managers since December

 

With that in mind, Levy made his move for Pochettino. Work towards the South American's appointment has been ongoing behind the scenes for over a fortnight.

Fears over Pochettino's grasp of English were soon allayed as Spurs chiefs discovered, despite his decision to use an interpreter for his press duties, that he communicates freely and confidently in English.

As a result, he will be expected to conduct his public speaking in English, without the use of an interpreter.

But just as Tottenham were laying the groundwork for the arrival of Pochettino, Southampton were just as busy; attempting to keep their highly-rated boss at St Mary's.

The offer of a new three-year contract and the promise of a healthy transfer kitty were made, providing Pochettino with somewhat of a dilemma.

But in his heart-of-hearts Pochettino's mind was made up; a chance of moving to a club the size of Tottenham does not come around often.

Even last week, however, when Pochettino looked nailed on to replace Sherwood, things could easily have turned out differently.

It is understood further contact between Tottenham and De Boer took place at the start of last week as decision time loomed for Levy and Co.

Winning smile: Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti was Levy's dream candidate for the Tottenham hotseat

Going into the weekend it was virtually neck-and-neck between Pochettino and De Boer.

'Pochettino has a 51 percent chance, De Boer 49,' said one source.

And when Real Madrid lifted their 10th European crown in Lisbon on Saturday night, thus ending any hope of luring Ancelotti back to the capital, Levy knew it was time.

Pochettino or De Boer?

The former Espanyol manager's five-year deal at White Hart Lane seems a strong commitment given Levy's penchant for hiring and firing.

Familiar face: Pochettino could raid former club Southampton for striker Jay Rodriguez

And it's hiring and firing that will take up much of Pochettino's time between now and the start of the season.

He will be given a healthy transfer budget to strengthen the Spurs squad, with Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez among the early contenders to follow him from St Mary's.

But last summer's splurge on over £100million worth of talent will mean there is not another blow out.

Pochettino will be expected to coax the best out of his star-studded squad; in particular £30million misfit Erik Lamela.

Last hurrah? Emmanuel Adebayor (right) could be leaving Tottenham following Pochettino's appointment

The Argentine will look to supplement his transfer budget by offloading a clutch of players: Emmanuel Adebayor, who is a target for Monaco, Roberto Soldado and Michael Dawson are among those who could go.

Similarly, Pochettino will seek talks with unsettled duo Jan Vertonghen and Hugo Lloris, who are both keen on moves to Champions League club's this summer.

It's already been a busy summer for Pochettino; and it's about to get busier.
