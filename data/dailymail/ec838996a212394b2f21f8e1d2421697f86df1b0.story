You would think his job stinks but this professional Australian diver says he loves his work - even though he's often completely submerged in poo.

Brendan Walsh runs a commercial diving business in Melbourne and spends his days in all sorts of no-air environments, with a small part being sewage.

He has been diving in sewage for about 14 years and said that specific side of his East West Dive and Salvage business was quite lucrative.

Brendan Walsh is essentially a professional Australian poo diver who runs a commercial diving business in Melbourne

'It’s definitely not a job for the faint-hearted,' Mr Walsh told Daily Mail Australia.

'It’s more thick than normal diving and you can’t see anything no matter what. It's more like walking than swimming when you get down there.'

Mr Walsh said diving into sewage was like working with 'brown-gold' because not many people want to touch it.

'I love my job and always have. I'm a passionate diver from way back, and I'm a mechanic. I've never worked a day in my life because I combine my passions. You can't do a job well unless you love it,' he said.

Divers have to basically walk instead of swim like other dives because the sewage is often quite thick

Even though it's completely black when he dives into the sewage, Mr Walsh said he has found all sorts of items down there.

'We founds lots of false teeth but mainly male and female hygiene products. When we come back out we often have condoms hanging off you. People also don't chew their corn,' he said.

Employees wear fully encapsulated suits when they dive down into the sewage, which blocks out the nasty smells you would expect to find. 

'You can’t smell anything, all the air is bottled. If you do smell something you’ve got a problem,' Mr Walsh said.

Sewage diving in Australia is essential because we use bacteria instead of chemicals to break down the solids

Big stirring machines run 24 hours a day to decompose sewage and moving parts constantly break. The Melbourne business is then called in to repair them

The smell is always worse for the people who have to decontaminate divers who have been in the sewage, Mr Walsh says

'It's actually worse for the guys who have to decontaminate you when you get out.'

Mr Walsh said he's never gotten sick from poo diving or even by the thought of being emerged in it.

'What the eyes don’t see the heart doesn’t feel,' he said.

'We have dived in some horrible stuff like basements and drains of hospitals… they’re worse because you can actually see what you're dealing with.'
