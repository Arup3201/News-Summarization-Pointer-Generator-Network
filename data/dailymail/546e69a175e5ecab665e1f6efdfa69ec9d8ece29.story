A woman who crashed her SUV and ended up at the bottom of an embankment for two days was saved by a inquisitive passerby on Wednesday.

Billie Earl, 68, of Herrin, Illinois, disappeared on Monday afternoon after driving her car off the road. She then spent 48 hours with no food and water in sub-zero temperatures.

Earl was rescued when local resident Alan Geary noticed skidmarks on the road and went to investigate. Geary found Earl at the bottom of the steep bank, perilously close to a former strip mine, flooded with around 50 feet of water.

Billie Earl's SUV ended up only feet away from a former strip pit full of deep water

Earl went missing around 1 pm on Monday afternoon when her SUV left the road, careered through bushes and came to a stop at the bottom of the ravine.

She crawled out of her car but, due to knee and hip injuries, was unable to make it any closer to safety.

Earl remained there, trapped around 90 feet from the busy Crenshaw Road, for the next two days.

While the wintry conditions put Earl's life in severe danger, they also saved her - she ate ice to stay hydrated.

Good samaritan: Alan Geary noticed skidmarks on the road and went to investigate. He discovered Billie Earl, who had been trapped for 48 hours

Earl was discovered on Wednesday, when passerby Geary became curious about signs of an accident. After getting out of his truck to take a look he spotted Earl's vehicle.

The SUV was crashed perilously close next to the old strip pit. As Geary explained to Wsiltv.com, this was the first of Earl's incredible escapes.

'That pit probably has 50-60 feet of water and it's straight down, ain't no doubt the car would have sunk,' said Geary.

The man thought the car had been stolen and abandoned, so he alerted authorities. But then he heard Earl's faint cries for help.

It was impossible for Geary to reach the woman so he called for help. 'I seen her, and told sheriff's department I needed an ambulance and people out here quick,' he told Wspdlocal.

Authorities were then able to rush the miraculous survivor to hospital, where she remains in a stable condition.

Earl may need surgery on her knee, and it will take plenty time to recover from her ordeal.

But her life was saved by good fortune and Geary's curiosity. 'Just amazed me after two nights out there she made it,' Geary said.

Yet he also believed Earl's escape was an act of God. 'The good lord upstairs, he ain't willing to take you till it's your time. Evidently it wasn't her time,' he told Wpsd.

The woman would not have survived if the vehicle had fallen into the pit. 'That pit probably has 50-60 feet of water and it's straight down, ain't no doubt the car would have sunk,' her rescuer said
