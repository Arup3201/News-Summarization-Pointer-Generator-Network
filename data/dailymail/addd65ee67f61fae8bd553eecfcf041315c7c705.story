Wayne Rooney admitted Sir Bobby Charlton's goalscoring records for club and country are in his sights after leapfrogging Michael Owen with his 41st strike for England.

Charlton scored 49 for England and 249 for Manchester United during his distinguished playing career. Rooney, who will earn his 97th cap tonight, scored against Norway at Wembley on Wednesday in his first official game as captain. The 28-year-old has also scored 217 times for United.

'I'd be a fool if I didn't look at Sir Bobby Charlton's record and feel capable of passing him.

'It's in my sights. I want to do it. Hopefully one day I can.

'Both records have stood for a long time, and a lot of players have attempted to break them. Now they're in touching distance, the two of them. 

'It's something I'd love to do. I feel I'm capable of doing it. Hopefully one day I'll hold the two records. I'm confident that I can.'

Rooney is now fourth on the list of all-time leading goalscorers for England behind Charlton, Gary Lineker (48) and Jimmy Greaves (44).
