She  may have left school with just two O-levels but yesterday Susan Boyle was awarded a  doctorate… albeit an honorary one.

The 51-year-old singer received the honour at Edinburgh’s Queen Margaret University – where she once studied for a certificate in caring –  for her contribution to the creative industries.

Miss Boyle, who was runner-up in Britain’s Got Talent in April 2009 and has since amassed a £10million fortune, has told she struggled at school.

She said: ‘I found it difficult to 
write my letters. I also suffered from what psychologists call cognitive
difficulties. I knew the answers to questions but couldn’t express what
I was thinking.’

Boyle
shot to fame after appearing on the Britain's Got Talent show. Although
she has become a top recording artist, Boyle has struggled to cope with
her fame.

Shortly after appearing on the show, she was treated at the 
Priory clinic for exhaustion.

She
has had a number of public outbursts that have raised concerns of her 
health. Her most recent was last month as she waited for a coffee at a 
service station. She said she was tired, and wanted to go home, before 
bursting into tears.

It is thought to be only the latest 
in a string of ‘flare-ups’, amid fears that Miss Boyle, one of the 
world’s most successful recording artists, has been working too hard. 
She is currently appearing in the musical I Dreamed a Dream, the story 
of her rise to fame.

Miss Boyle, known as SuBo to 
her fans, lost her composure after stopping to order a takeaway at the 
Burger King restaurant at the northbound services on the M6 in 
Knutsford, Cheshire, on Thursday. She was believed to have been on her 
way home to Scotland.

A source close to Miss Boyle said at the time: ‘Everyone knows that Susan is not able to express her emotions as many would which adds to her frustration.

‘She wanted to go home as she was tired and upset and wanted  to be in the sanctuary of her  own house.

‘She is very grateful for the amazing life she is now living and wouldn’t swop it for the world.
