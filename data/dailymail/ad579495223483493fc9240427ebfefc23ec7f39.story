Scientists may have found a way to banish flu, after developing a drug that saw mice unaffected by lethal doses of the virus.

The drug blocks a molecule called PGE2, and saw mice survive a dose of H1N1 – also known as swine flu - after administration.

This could see development of a pill to beat flu in humans, an illness which kills thousands every year.

Soon just a memory?: The new discovery means that science is one step closer to developing a pill against flu

It is hoped that the drug which blocked PGE2 in mice could also block the molecule in the human body.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to 49,000 people die from flu-related illnesses every year.

In 2009 alone, up to 575,000 people died from swine flu (H1N1).

Emerging strains continually threaten to spread to humans and cause even deadlier pandemics.

The new finding published in the journal Immunity paves the way for an urgently needed therapy that is highly effective against flu and maybe other viral infections.

‘Drugs that specifically target PGE2 
pathways have already been developed and tested in animals, so our 
results have excellent potential for clinical translation, not only for 
the treatment of influenza, but other viral respiratory infections that 
interact with similar host immune pathways,’ author of study Dr Maziar 
Divangahi, of McGill University, Montreal, said.

Mice genetically engineered to lack the 
PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) molecule were more resistant to flu infections 
than others and the vast majority survived after being injected with a 
deadly dose of H1N1.

Scientists in Montreal, Canada found that by blocking a molecule called PGE2, mice survived lethal doses of H1N1, also known as swine flu

Similarly, mice treated with a compound that blocks PGE2 showed enhanced antiviral immunity and produced better survival rates following infection with the lethal shot compared with untreated animals.

In spite of the worldwide use of vaccination and other antiviral interventions, flu remains a persistent threat to human health.

By inhibiting a molecule called COX (cyclooxygenase), ibuprofen and other NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs) lower the production of the five prostanoids such as PGE2, immune molecules that contribute to pain and fever.

Francois Coulombe, a PhD student in Dr Divangahi’s lab who led the study, said: 'But since these drugs inhibit all prostanoids, each may contribute differently towards the immunity against influenza virus. Understanding their individual role is crucial in developing a new therapy.'
