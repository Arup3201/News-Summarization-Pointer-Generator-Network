Cardiff are closing in on their ninth summer signing after agreeing a fee in excess of £5million fee for Lorient defender Bruno Ecuele Manga.

The 26-year-old has not yet had a medical but manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is hopeful of completing a deal before the close of the transfer window.

The Norwegian admitted he was in the market for one more player after his side's 1-1 draw with Fulham on Saturday and the Gabon international looks like being the Bluebirds' final arrival.

Fresh start: The 26-year-old will play in England for the first time after spending his career in France

Solskjaer has already brought Anthony Pilkington, Sean Morrison, Adam Le Fondre, Guido Bergstaller, Federico Macheda, Javi Guerra, Kagisho Dikgacoi and Tom Adeyemi to south Wales this summer.

The former Manchester United striker needs a new defender after selling Steven Caulker to QPR and seeing Ben Turner pick up an ankle injury.

Former Bordeaux centre back Manga will provide competition for Morrison, Mark Hudson and Matthew Connolly.

Big spenders: Manga is set to become Cardiff's ninth summer signing at a cost of more than £5million
