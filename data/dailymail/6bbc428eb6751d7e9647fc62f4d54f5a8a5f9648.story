Lysette Anthony told the court how Mr Boswell had come home in a 'black mood'. He was acquitted of assault

She has starred in cult movies, Woody Allen intrigues and BBC sitcoms.

But for 'Face of the Eighties' actress Lysette Anthony, her most dramatic role yet came yesterday in the more banal surroundings of Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court.

The court in North London heard a complicated tale of alleged affairs, domestic violence, a relationship breakdown, and an apparent suicide attempt.

Miss Anthony’s long-term partner, 
BAFTA-nominated film composer Simon Boswell, was facing a charge of 
assault after the actress, 48, claimed the father of her young son had 
punched and slapped her during an argument about an alleged affair she’d
had with one of their mutual friends.

In
emotional scenes she told the court how their nine-year relationship 
had broken down, and that on April 9 Mr Boswell, 54, had come home in a 
‘black mood’, they had argued about the alleged affair before he pinned 
her on the sofa and attacked her.

In evidence Ms Anthony, 48, had said: 
'The relationship had broken down two years earlier but we kept trying 
to keep things better for our son.

'That evening I came down stairs from putting my son to bed and Simon was in a very black mood.

'He was in a really really dangerous mood and it started about money and
the house and how little he would give us. It was getting heated and I 
was frightened.

'He would pick me up and throw me down to the ground. At this point he 
would leave and that would be that but he came back and sat on the sofa.

'And foolishly maybe because I was accustomed to these activities I sat 
on the sofa with him.'

She said when Boswell attacked her he threatened 
to reduce the amount she would get from the joint sale of their home.

'He then used his weight against me, screaming 'Did you like it?' and 
when I wouldn't answer he said - 'Right that's £100,000 off' - and again
'Did you like it? - 'Ok that's £150,000 off.

'And then I replied: 'Yes I loved it' and he started punching and slapping me repeatedly.

'I tried to get him off at which point he flipped me over and started 
dragging me and I am desperately trying to hang onto the sofa.

'I kicked him hard but he didn't stop until my son came down saying 'stop, stop'.

'My child has memories no child should. Thank god he came down.'

But then Mr Boswell gave the court an entirely different version of events that followed a row over money when the actress allegedly tried to climb out of a window of their £1.7million North London home, in an apparent suicide attempt.

Boswell told the court: 'The next morning we had a heated discussion about money, it was always about money.

'There was this house she wanted but it was going up and up - it had become too much and I wanted to discuss it with her.

'She was angry because it was unaffordable. Ms Anthony became hysterical.

'She ran to one window in our bedroom on the top floor and she put one 
leg and her head outside. I was terrified and I pulled her back in.

'She then ran to the window in the bathroom and did the same thing straddling the windowsill. I managed to drag her back in.

'I was preventing her from committing suicide. She was screaming and 
very volatile. I thought she was going to jump - it was distinct 
possibility.

'She then grabbed a wine glass, which was on the side of the bath, smashed it and began to draw it across her wrists.

'I said - 'For Christ's sake you have a son what are you doing?' And she
threw it at me and collapsed sobbing.'

Boswell then claims things 
calmed down between them and they had even shared a 'joke about having 
sex' on a trip they were to take to a film festival in Brussels.

He said she was 'driven by insecurity and jealousy' in bringing the assault charge to court.

Following Mr Boswell’s evidence, Miss Anthony changed her mind on the date of the alleged incident. Mr Boswell’s defence barrister then applied for the case to be dismissed and the three magistrates duly found Mr Boswell not guilty of assault.

Magistrate Anthony Butler, threw out the
case and said: 'We would expect the crown to clarify the date prior to 
the trial date.'

Former model Miss Anthony, has appeared in the BBC’s Three Up, Two Down and Woody Allen’s Husbands And Wives.

Mr Boswell has been BAFTA-nominated for his film scores, worked with Elton John and Dolly Parton, and the wealthy couple lived in a four-storey London townhouse in north London.

But the wheels started to come off their relationship two years ago when Miss Anthony allegedly had an affair with one of their mutual friends.

They had tried to repair things for the sake of their seven-year-old son Jimi, but eventually Mr Boswell had moved out to a studio flat where he did much of his composing.

They decided to separate and sell the
family home, but Mr Boswell still visited regularly to see Jimi and 
read him a bedtime story.

But things became acrimonious as they argued about how much each side would get from the proceeds of the house.

Mr Boswell will not face any further charges following yesterday's ruling.

Miss Anthony was ordered to pay defence costs and was denied a restraining order against Mr Boswell.

Outside court Mr Boswell gave a thumbs up sign and said: ‘The verdict speaks for itself.’
