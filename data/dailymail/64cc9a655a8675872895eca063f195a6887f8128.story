Rumours stating that Australia's Princess Mary is to be crowned the Queen of Denmark as the current Queen nears abdication have been slammed by the royal family.

Woman's Day claimed that the coronation of Mary and her husband, Prince Fredrick, could be announced in 'just weeks', in their latest publication on Monday.

The magazine said the reason Queen Margrethe was stepping down was due to her 'bad back' which has prevented her from attending many royal functions recently.

The coronation would come following the abdication of Queen Margrethe who is suffering from a bad back, the magazine claimed

A Danish publication ended the rumours however, with a comment from a Royal House spokesperson who described them as 'nonsense'.

'Australia's favourite royal export Princess Mary is expected to be crowned Queen of Denmark. And it could happen any day now,' Woman's Day wrote.

'Her Royal Highness is waiting to take over the title as the current reigning monarch Queen Margrethe, 74, prepares to pass on the baton to her graceful daughter-in-law due to ill health.

'…plans are well and truly underway to fast-track our beloved Mary and her husband Crown Prince Frederik's coronation.' 

However the Royal Family has denied the rumours, calling them 'nonsense' according to a Danish publication,Metroxpress.

A Royal House spokesperson told the publication: 'there is nothing to that story'.

'It is nonsense and Her Majesty the Queen is doing just fine.'

Woman's Day even stated that Mary was 'thrilled' about taking on the role.

Had the rumours proven true, it would have been a proud day for Australians when the Tasmanian born princess was crowned. 

The love story of Mary and Prince Fredrick, who met in a Tasmanian bar during the 2000 Olympic Games, won the hearts of Aussies and Europeans everywhere when they finally married in 2004.

The royal couple have since had four children together, Christian, Isabella, Vincent and Josephine.

The rare occasion of abdications have been a more frequent that normal in the past two years, with two kings and one queen giving up their thrones across Europe.

In the Netehrlands, Queen Beatrix let go of the title at the age of 75 in April last year, followed by Belgium’s Albert II, 78. Spain’s King Juan Carlos also abdicated at the age of 76 in June this year.

All three passed on their crowns to their sons.
