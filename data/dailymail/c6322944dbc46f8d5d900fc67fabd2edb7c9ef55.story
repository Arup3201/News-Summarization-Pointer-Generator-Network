Never missed: No one had reported the disappearance of Kimberly Adler around four years ago

A father concealed the remains of his adult daughter for more than three years at his former home, at one point moving the body into a crawl space, authorities said today.

The body of Kimberly Adler was discovered this week by a cleaning crew reportedly employed by the new owner to clear out the property.

Dennis Adler, 57, appeared in State Superior Court in Monmouth County, New Jersey to face a charge of disturbing human remains. Adler didn't enter a plea and was held on $100,000 bail.

Police were called to Adler's former home in Keansburg on Tuesday after a cleaning service discovered the remains.

Dental records confirmed the remains were those of Kimberly Adler, believed to the 23 years old.Â 

It could take a few weeks to receive the results of an autopsy to determine the cause of death.

Miss Adler was never reported missing.

According to the arrest warrant, 
Adler is accused of 'repeatedly moving, disturbing and concealing the 
remains of K.A. on diverse dates beginning on 8/10/2008'.

Prosecutors would not provide further details on the investigation.

Mystery: Adler hadn't been seen by acquaintances in almost a year before he was picked up by police

County
property records describe Adler as an 'widower' at the time of the 
property being sold in June 2008 and said that his wife died in April 2007.

The couple had bought the property, which includes several buildings, in 1989.

John Sheehan, who was listed as the buyer of the property, did not return a telephone message on Thursday.

Some
residents at a rented property in Keansburg, which was listed on the 
warrant as Adler's last known address, said they hadn't seen him in 
almost a year.

Neighbors
on the street of modest one-story homes where Miss Adler's body was 
found refused to comment on the discovery or said they did not know the 
house's former owner.

A pile of debris lay in back of the house while out front TV news trucks gathered.
