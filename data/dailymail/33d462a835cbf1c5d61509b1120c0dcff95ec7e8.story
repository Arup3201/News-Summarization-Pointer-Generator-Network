While the increasing trend of Internet purchases continues to threaten traditional stores, new research has found that more than five million Australians have experienced an 'online shopping fail'.

And the inconvenience of return processes, which are often costly, have resulted in over $460 million in unwanted purchases over the years.

In response to these alarming figures, PayPal Australia has launched a new service for customers to refund up to $45 of return shipping costs for their online purchases.

Daily Mail Australia has gathered a series of images of incorrect packages, which have been posted on social media by disappointed customers.

PayPal Australia announced the launch of their free shipping return service on Thursday, allowing customers to request a refund on shipping costs of up to $45 on the PayPal website within 14 days.

Joint research by Ipsos and PayPal, conducted in the past 12 months on 1001 respondents, found that more than half of those who had considered returning an unwanted item had failed to do so mainly due to shipping costs.

Other factors also included unnecessary hassle  or complicated returns processes.

The research on Australians aged 18-64 also revealed that nine in 10 respondents said that they would more likely shop online if the retailer had a free returns policy.

This comes as pictures emerged of a Chinese shopper who suffered an online shopping fail with an ill-fitting cut-out dress that wasn't quite the glamorous gown she thought she was buying.

The black dress, a copy of one worn by Thor actress Jaime Alexander at the film's premiere in 2013, features top-to-bottom see-through panels on the front and back.

However the unsatisfied shopper posted comparison pictures on the seller's page, showing how the dress revealed far more than she intended.  

And this isn't the first time though that disgruntled online shoppers have been let down.

Earlier this year, many women took to the Internet to lament the fact that the dresses they had ordered looked nothing like the pictures they had been shown.

Most of those duped were brides looking for an alternative to buying their wedding dress from an expensive bridal store.
