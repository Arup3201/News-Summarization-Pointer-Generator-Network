A police union chief slammed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday for his failure to support city cops following the grand jury decision in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. 

New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch criticized de Blasio, saying: 'Unequivocally, police officers feel like they have been thrown under the bus.'

Lynch also defended white Officer Daniel Pantaleo's role in the death of unarmed, black father-of-six Mr Garner - even as protesters planned a new round of demonstrations tonight.

The union chief said Pantaleo had acted properly in restraining Eric Garner during an arrest attempt in the borough of Staten Island on July 17.

'He's a model of what we want a police officer to be,' Lynch said.

The police spokesman's staunch remarks came hours after commenters on a popular police blog angrily hit back at the widespread public protests and condemnation by political figures over the decision not to indict.

The backlash on site, Policeone, came from some claiming police backgrounds and other law-enforcement supporters. The anonymous comments attacked outraged protesters, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, President Obama, Attorney-General Eric Holder and the media for their opposition to the grand jury decision.

One post from VON1 read: 'Have you heard the mayor of NY press release. Wow! 35,000 cops just got b****slapped.' 

Another comment read: 'Stay safe, brothers. You're in for another set of riots.' 

The blog Policeone, which is dedicated to law enforcement, had a barrage of comments in support of the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo

New York City erupted in protests on Wednesday after a grand jury decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo, 29, who grabbed Mr Garner and put him in a chokehold which led to his death on July 17 in Staten Island. 

In a direct and sometimes passionate speech from Staten Island on Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio made his dismay clear about a jury's decision not to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo.

De Blasio was among several prominent political figures to address the decision. President Obama himself went so far as to concede police racial bias does exist.

Obama also revealed he'd spoken with Attorney General Eric Holder about the case. 

Holder on Wednesday evening announced the Department of Justice's civil rights wing had launched an investigation into the death of 43-year-old father-of-six.

An emotional de Blasio said the decision of a grand jury not to indict the officer who who put Eric Garner into a fatal chokehold was 'a very painful day for so many New Yorkers'. 

On the Policeone blog, which  primarily covers law enforcement issues, the comments came thick and fast beneath an article which reported there would be no indictment for Officer Pantaleo.

The comments came from police supporters or those claiming to be employed in law enforcement.

office1149 posted: 'If you can shout ''I can't breath'' [sic] you can probably breath [sic]!' 

The comment referred to the numerous times that 43-year-old Mr Garner cried out that he couldn't breathe as officers pinned him to the ground during the video-taped attack before he lost consciousness. 

Other comments specifically attacked Mayor de Blasio. wasafuzz wrote: 'New York City Mayor and the entire New York City Council sided with criminal of 31 prior arrests Eric Gardner.'

Another anonymous comment from, 1661, said: 'Isn't it great how the press minimizes what the criminal did, and vilifies the evil "White NYC police officer" portraying him killing a harmless "unarmed black man." Here comes Eric Holder with an NYPD consent decree!'

In a deeply personal and heartfelt address, Mayor de Blasion, whose wife Chirlane McCray is African American, said that when he spoke to Eric Garner's bereaved father: 'I couldn't help but immediately think of what it would mean to me to lose (his son) Dante.'

With barely a word of support for the NYPD or their cleared officer, de Blasio's used his own son to explain that he knows the struggle and frustration that black people feel when dealing with police in New York City.

'We've had to talk to Dante for years about dangers he may face,' said de Blasio about the infamous 'talk' many parents of African American or mixed-race children have nationwide.

'I've had to worry over the years..Is my child safe? And not just from harsh realities…crimes and violence…are they safe from the people they want to have faith in (cops)?' 

Calling it a 'national moment of pain', the mayor said that racial profiling and distrust between African Americans and the police is 'a problem for all New Yorkers, it is a problem for all Americans. It's all our problem.' 

The mayor also said that he had spoken with NYPD Commissioner Bratton about retraining the entire police force.

'It should be self-evident, (but) our history requires us to say 'black lives matter'.

The short address at times felt like a line in the sand being drawn by de Blasio, especially when he quoted his commissioner, Bill Bratton on weeding out those who do not belong in law enforcement.

'The department will act aggressively to ensure that any officer who is not meant to be in this work no longer is.' 

Indeed, he left the air hanging with the question of whether Officer Pantaleo will remain with the NYPD.

Earlier, the widow of Eric Garner had exclaimed 'Oh my God, are you serious?' when she discovered the verdict, while de Blasio issued an earlier, equally emotional statement and declared that 'Today's outcome is one that many in our city did not want.' 

President Obama broke off from a planned speech to address the verdict saying, 'Police brutality is an American problem.'

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks to the media during a news conference in Staten Island after a grand jury  decided not to charge white police officer Daniel Pantaleo who killed unarmed black man Eric Garner with a chokehol

After the decision was released it was announced the NYPD was recalling all officers from non-essential court business in anticipation of potential city-wide disturbances. 

Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan said the grand jury found 'no reasonable cause' to bring charges against Garner, who was selling loose, un-taxed cigarettes.

In the neighborhood where  father-of-six Garner died, people reacted with shouts, chants of 'Eric Garner' and expressions of angry disbelief.  Garner's father, Benjamin Carr, urged calm and said the ruling made no sense.

The grand jury could have considered a range of charges, from murder to a lesser offense such as reckless endangerment.

'I am actually astonished based on the evidence of the videotape, and the medical examiner, that this grand jury at this time wouldn't indict for anything,' said a lawyer for Garner's family, Jonathan Moore.  

The decision, which comes nine days after the Ferguson grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson, threatens to increase already fraught racial tensions nationwide and lead to more protests.

The death of the father-of-six sparked national outrage just weeks before the fatal shooting of Michael Brown amid accusations of police brutality against African Americans. 

The decision by the grand jury panel means that a majority of them did not think there was probable cause a crime was committed by Pantaleo, who was the only NYPD officer facing indictment. 

Two other officers at the scene were offered immunity if they testified before the grand jury.  

The Medical Examiner's Office ruled his death a homicide but police union members have always denied Pantaleo used a chokehold.

The medical examiner  concluded the chokehold was the cause of death.

Officer Pantaleo issued a statement following the announcement of the grand jury decision to say he felt 'very bad.'

'I became a police officer to help people and to protect those who can't protect themselves,' said Pantaleo.

'It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner.

'My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.'
