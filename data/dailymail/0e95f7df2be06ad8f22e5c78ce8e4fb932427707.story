Stoke's ambitious bid to sign Xherdan Shaqiri could meet an abrupt end as the Swiss international has told Bayern Munich he wishes to join Inter Milan. 

Potters No 2 Mark Bowen has revealed that the Bayern Munich attacker is a surprise transfer target for the club.

'To get a good player like him on board would be fantastic,' Bowen told Radio Stoke on Tuesday.

Several clubs are chasing the signature of Bayern Munich attacker Xherdan Shaqiri in January 

Stoke pulled off a major coup in the summer when they secured Bojan Krkic (right) from Barcelona 

'There are other clubs interested, but it doesn't mean we rule ourselves out. He's definitely on the list, but there is competition for a player of his ability.'

Bowen believes Bojan's move to the club from Barcelona helps. 

'It's bound to help and it does help,' he said. 'There's many boxes to tick, not least the financial side of it, and with Shaqiri coming from one of the best clubs in the world, there's a lot of persuasion to get it done.'

Shaqiri has also been linked with Liverpool with the midfielder said to be well liked by Brendan Rodgers. 

Stoke remain keen on PSV Eindhoven's Zak Bakkali, 18, and Aaron Lennon of Tottenham..
