A woman went into cardiac arrest during an $11,000 liposuction procedure at a New York plastic surgery clinic and was pronounced dead in hospital.

Simone Jones, 45, of Brooklyn underwent the operation on February 9 at Lexington Plastic Surgeons in Manhattan when her heart rate dropped.

At the time, her surgery was allegedly 98 per cent complete, the plastic surgeon, Dr. Alan Bienstock told Jones' daughter, Shantay.

The cause of Simone's death remains under investigation as the city medical examiner awaits test results, and Jones' family lawyer has also demanded an investigation by the Department of Health, the New York Daily News.

Simone, a mental health aide and mother-of-four, had saved the funds to pay for liposuction on her legs, arms and back, a buttocks lift and a tummy tuck.

Shantay, 26, said her mother was looking forward to showing off her new look.

'She was very attractive and looked young for her age and she wanted the whole package. She took pride in her appearance,' she said.

As she had spoken to her mother before she had gone in for the operation that morning, Shantay said she was called by the clinic hours after her mother had checked in.

She was told there was a complication and to go to Bellevue Hospital as soon as possible.

When she arrived, Dr Bienstock along with other doctors shared the news about her mother, explaining that her heart rate dropped while they were working on her buttocks.

'Ms. Jones, an otherwise healthy woman went in for an ambulatory procedure and apparently her vital signs were not being properly monitored so as to allow this tragedy to occur,' said the family's lawyer, Scott Rynecki. 

Shantay said she never got a clear answer on what happened and that Dr Bienstock said it could have been a blood clot among other possibilities.

When the clinic called the following day to express sympathy for the family's loss, Simone's aunt suggested the money be returned, but Dr Bienstock never got back in touch with them regarding it.

Until they have answers, Shantay and her family will continue demanding for clarity concerning her mother's death.

She said: 'I want answers. We are going to fight for her because she would have fought for us.'
