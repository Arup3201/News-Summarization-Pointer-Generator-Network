It's a truth every politician worth his salt knows well: when things go badly, kiss a baby... and everything will work out just fine.

But when embattled Vladimir Putin decided to give it a go at a Winter Games fan bar last night, there were no babies on hand... so he found a young boy to hug instead.

The under-fire Russian president took a tour of Sochi's various 'fan bars' in the Olympic Village where he congratulated athletes, swigged beer and smiled at anyone who would smile back. There were even a few high-fives.

Charm offensive: When Vladimir Putin went on a charm offensive at a Winter Games fan bar last night, there were no babies on hand to kiss... so he found a young boy to hug instead

Who needs a hug? The Russian President also kissed a pretty athlete and hugged a young girl during the tour of the Olympic Village

They included a bar packed with Russian fans, another of Austrian fans and a nightclub where hundreds of Dutch Olympic fans had gathered to honour their gold-medal winning speedskater Ireen Wust.

'I got a cuddle from him,' Wust told Dutch national broadcaster NOS. 'He congratulated me and asked if everything was OK in Russia and I congratulated him on (Russian speedskater) Olga Graf, of course, for her third place (in the 3,000 meters). He was happy to see me, but then he had to leave again. But I cuddled him.'

Heavy night: Putin switched to vodka later while visiting Austrians at Austria Tyrol House in Sochi

Good time guy: Holland Heineken House is renowned at recent Olympic Games as a great place for a party, drawing thousands of fans with a cocktail of live music, the chance to see a Dutch medal winner and perhaps a couple of beers

Easing tension: A series of incidents have strained relations between the Netherlands and Russia in recent months, including a diplomat being arrested by police in The Hague and Russia's detention of a Dutch-flagged protest ship and its crew

Holland Heineken House is renowned at recent Olympic Games as a great place for a party, drawing thousands of fans with a cocktail of live music, the chance to see a Dutch medal winner and perhaps a couple of beers.

A series of incidents have strained relations between the Netherlands and Russia in recent months, including a diplomat being arrested by police in The Hague and Russia's detention of a Dutch-flagged protest ship and its crew.

Following the Russian figure skating team's gold medal win, Putin headed straight for the competitors, who looked a little nervous to meet him

High fives: Putin appeared jolly as he congratulated people rink-side

Well done: Putin posed for a photograph with the Russian ice dance team after they placed first in the team figure skating competition at the Iceberg Skating Palace

Diplomatic: Despite frosty relations with the US in recent months, Putin also found time to shake hands with Meryl Davis of the United States, who placed third in the team figure skating competition

But there was no sign of any lingering tensions as Putin made his way out of the house and spoke to a reporter in English.

'Fantastic,' he said of his brief visit. 'Very good. Good people and good results ... good party.'

But it has been Putin's recent legislation banning 'anti-homosexual propaganda' in his homeland that has sparked a chorus of international outrage as well as calls ot boycott the Games.

Restrictive: Critics say the law is so restrictive that it forbids almost any public expression of support for gay rights

Last week, he appeared to rub salt in the wound saying gays should feel welcome at the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, but they must 'leave the children in peace'.

Mr Putin told volunteers that gays visiting Sochi 'can feel calm and at ease,' and vowed that there would be no discrimination at the games.

But he emphasised that, according to a law banning homosexual 'propaganda' among minors, gays cannot express their views on gay rights issues to anyone under age.

The law, signed by Putin in July, bans pro-gay 'propaganda' that could be accessible to minors. Critics say it is so 
restrictive that it forbids almost any public expression of support for 
gay rights.

Last month, for example, a newspaper editor in Russia's Far 
East was fined 50,000 rubles ($1,400) for publishing an interview with a
gay school teacher who defended homosexuality.

The International Olympic Committee and its corporate sponsors are being pressed to denounce 
the law and call for its repeal. A campaign was launched on several fronts 
in July that included a boycott of Russian vodka.
