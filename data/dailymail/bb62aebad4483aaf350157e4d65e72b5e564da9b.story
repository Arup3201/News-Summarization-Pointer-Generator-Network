From Shakepeare's terrifying crones to the Hansel and Gretel sorceress with a taste for cannibalism, witches have long exercised a malevolent hold on the popular imagination.

Now the witch is the subject of a new exhibition at the British Museum which runs until January and charts the journey of the wicked enchantress from the medieval era to the beginning of the 20th century.

Featuring works by Durer, Delacroix and Rossetti among others, it delves into the near universal terror of witches - and the equally dreadful consequences for the women caught up.

But early witches weren't the horrid hags of the Middle Ages. Many, among them Lilith, thought to be the first wife of Adam and his equal, sorceress Circe and Hercules' unfaithful wife Medea, were as beautiful as they were powerful.  

The theme of the witch as a powerful woman resurfaced again in the Middle Ages, when witches, although no longer lovely to look at, were presented as having the ability to control the weather or strike down grown men and infants alike.

Pagan associations with classical gods and goddesses, in particular Diana the Huntress, compounded the malevolent reputation of the witch as Christian priests railed against what they saw as an abomination and a heresy. 

But although most witches were women, men and children were also accused of witchcraft during the medieval period as people, seeing catastrophes such as the Black Death and internecine warfare unfold around them, blamed sorcery for their ills.

Unsurprisingly, this led to persecution, mostly of women, with attempts to eradicate witchcraft gathering speed as the 14th century began.

By 1563, it had been made a capital offence in Britain as well as in much of Western Europe; a law that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 200,000 women between 1484 and 1750.

But the terror induced by the thought of witchcraft wasn't entirely the fault of imagination alone - as the new exhibition makes plain, the flowering of the arts went hand in hand with an uptick in witchcraft cases.

Leading the charge were the print-makers, whose cheap and cheerful pamphlets, books and engravings meant that terrifying images of evil hags spread among all sections of the population.

From 1500 onwards, pamphlets outlining the supposed malign powers of the witch became commonplace, while cheap copies of the notorious Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Witches) were available to all.

Witch trials, as a result, became increasingly common during the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular during periods of civil unrest.

Much of the art that fuelled them, however, was striking. Among them were single-sheet prints made by the Renaissance print-makers Albrecht Dürer and Hans Baldung Grien - both of which rapidly became popular with collectors. 

One that did particularly well was Grien's The Witches' Sabbath, a colour woodcut print from 1510 that depicts four nude female figures sitting on the ground with a cauldron. 

The cauldron is emitting big plumes of smoke and traces of a potion with frogs round the figures, the ground is littered with bones, pitchforks and to the right of the image a cat is sitting with its back turned.

In the night sky, another two witches, one barely visible, the other riding a goat and carrying a pitchfork with another cauldron and animal bones. 

The figure of a witch riding backwards on a goat in Baldung’s work is said to have been inspired by Dürer’s engraving of the very same name. 

Made circa 1500, A Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat is an allegory for how witchcraft was thought to reverse the natural order of things, so the hair of the witch streams out in one direction, while the goat and the trail of drapery go the other way.

But not every witch was depicted as a horrid hag. Witches were also shown as bewitching seductresses intent on ensnaring their male victims, a type loved by Giovanni Battisa Castiglione, an artist famous for his etchings of Circe.

By contrast, Francisco de Goya  turned the subject of witches into an art form all of its own and took the grotesque to new heights courtesy of his penchant for compositions that showed women conducting hideous activities on animals and children.

During the eighteenth century, Henry Fuseli’s Weird Sisters from Macbeth influenced generations of theatre-goers, and illustrations of Goethe’s Faust were popularised by Eugène Delacroix.

By the end of the 19th century, hideous old hags with distended breasts and snakes for hair were mostly replaced by sexualised and mysteriously exotic sirens, most famously in Dante Gabriel Rossetti's depictions of Lilith.

This new approach to witches was mirrored in the treatment of suspected witches in the real world too, with witch trials and burnings finally consigned to history as the 20th century dawned.
