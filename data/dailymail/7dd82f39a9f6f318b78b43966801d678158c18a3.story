 IN CAMP BASTION, AFGHANISTAN

Toiling to defuse deadly improvised explosive devices on the Afghan frontline, siblings Kim and Lee Hughes really are brothers in arms.

Kim, 34, is Britain’s bravest bomb hunter. The warrant officer was awarded the George Cross - the highest accolade for gallantry not in the face of the enemy - for heroism on the battlefield in 2009.

He has returned to the warzone to oversee the Army units clearing the homemade bombs strewn across Helmand.

No sibling rivalry: But Kim Hughes, who won the George Cross, admitted: 'I loved bossing him around'

It is a family affair because the team which thwarts the Taliban’s terror tactics includes his big brother Lee, 35, a staff sergeant.

Both soldiers insist there is no sibling rivalry – even though Kim, a married father-of-one, is the commander.

Warrant Officer Class One Hughes said: ‘It’s sound that we’re able to be out here together. We have a good time.

'Lee is my brother, but he’s also a mega operator. I’ve got no issues whatsoever with his capability.

‘The professional answer is every one of my solders is exactly the same and they are treated exactly the same. My answer is he’s my big brother, and I love bossing him around.’

S/Sgt Hughes, a married father-of-three, said: ‘I’m the less brave big brother. You look round the dinner table – there’s only one with a George Cross.

‘But it’s not too bad working for him. There is a mutual understanding but there’s still the rank structure.’

Both men serve with 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Regiment, part of the Royal Logistics Corps, but on this tour of duty they are attached to the Royal Engineers.

WO1 Hughes won his George Cross for what was hailed by top brass as ‘the single most outstanding act of explosive ordnance disposal ever recorded in Afghanistan’.

On the morning of August 16 2009, British troops were taking part in a mission to reclaim a chunk of Sangin, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand.

Disaster struck when Lance Corporal James Fullarton, 24, triggered a bomb. As he was evacuated on a stretcher by Fusilier Simon Annis, 22, and Fusilier Lewis Carter, 18, they tripped a second blast - killing them both and wounding three more.

WO1 Hughes was called on to rescue the four maimed soldiers who were stranded in the middle of a minefield.

Without a thought for his own safety, the bomb disposal expert cleared a path across the dusty open ground so the wounded could be evacuated and the dead men retrieved.

Shunning protective clothing to save time, he picked his way across the field dotted with more of the booby-trap bombs.

Keeping his cool beneath the Afghan sun and with the sound of bullets ringing in his ears, WO1 Hughes managed to dismantle seven IEDs - three by simply using his hands.

Honour: Kim Hughes, now a Warrant Officer Class One, was awarded the George Cross at Buckingham Palace for a mission in which he disarmed seven improvised bombs to save colleagues without safety clothes

His 'utterly selfless action' allowed the casualties to be recovered. Tragically, L/Cpl Fullarton later died from his injuries.

In total, WO1 Hughes cleared more than 80 buried bombs on that tour of duty.

Five years later, he is in the operations room co-ordinating missions while his brother goes out on the ground.

They have trained the Afghan National Security Forces to disarm IEDs.

WO1 Hughes said: ‘It’s different because I’m not out on the ground and Lee is one of the operators – he’s doing the job when I was back out here.

‘It’s a lot quieter now. Because of the amount of training we have given the Afghan forces they run their own EOD teams now.

‘They have taken the majority of the work but we still provide capability when it’s requested and needed.

‘It does give you a sense of satisfaction to know we are leaving this country absolutely prepared to deal with the task in front of them.'

Mum's the word: The men admitted their mother Francis, 54, has had a 'few years' of worrying about them

S/Sgt Hughes, who is on his third deployment to Afghanistan, has seen action during his stint in the warzone. On one occasion, he was 1ft from a booby-trap bomb which was protecting an insurgent ammunition dump.

He was inspired to become a bomb disposal expert after his brother signed up.

He said: ‘I spent eight years in the artillery and knew nothing about the job until Kim joined the Army and showed an interest in it.’

Both men admit their trade worries their mother Francis, 54. And their step-brother Matthew Heppenstall, 27, is about to join 11 EOD Regiment too.

S/Sgt Hughes said: ‘When Kim was in Afghanistan and I was in Iraq she was worried and then I came back and I went to Afghanistan and came back and now we’re both here.

'She’s had a few years of it.’
