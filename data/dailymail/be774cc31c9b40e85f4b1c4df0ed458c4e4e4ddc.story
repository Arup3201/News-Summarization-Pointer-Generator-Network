The London Eye, 10 Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament were among Britain's landmarks which turned out their lights for an hour at 10pm last night to remember those who died in the First World War.

Homes, businesses and public buildings across the UK were asked to leave on a single light or candle to commemorate the moment then-prime minister Herbert Asquith declared Britain had entered the First World War at 11pm on August 4, 1914.

Buildings around the country yesterday took part in the 'hour of reflection' between 10pm and 11pm, leaving just a light illuminating a window.

The plan was inspired by the words of then-foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey, who 
said just before the announcement: 'The lamps are going out all over 
Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.'

Other buildings taking part in an hour-long lights switch-off last night were Broadcasting House in London, the Eden
 Project in Cornwall, St Paul's and Durham cathedrals, and Wales 
Millennium Centre in Cardiff.

Also expected to join in were office buildings including Barclays in Canary Wharf and Marks & Spencer.

Prime Minister David Cameron has backed the idea and is urging as many people as possible to take part.

centenary and I would encourage people to take part and turn off their 
lights tomorrow at 10pm for an hour, apart from a single light or 
candle.

'This
 will be a personal gesture in remembrance of all those who made the 
ultimate sacrifice for us 100 years ago. They must never be forgotten.'

 idea is being promoted by the Royal British Legion, who brought

 in the initiative, which is inspired by the words of former Foreign

lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in 
our lifetime'

Charles
 Byrne, Director of Fundraising at The Royal British Legion, said: 'Sir 
Edward Grey's stirring words are the campaign's foundation.

'Our vision 
is that over one million candles will be lit across the UK, 
commemorating every Service man and woman who died during WW1.

'We hope to see candles lit at every war memorial, community centre and home in every village and in every community.

'This
 is one of a number of initiatives the Legion has undertaken to 
commemorate the anniversary of the First World War, when we hope to pass
 the torch of remembrance onto a younger generation ensuring there will 
always be a living legacy to those who sacrificed their today for our 
tomorrows.'

Coinciding with the start of the initiative at 10pm, a vigil service 
will be held at Westminster Abbey during which members of the 
congregation will extinguish candles until there is just one left alight
 on the tomb of the unknown soldier, which will be snuffed out by the 
Duchess of Cornwall at 11pm.
