Two sisters testified against their own father on Thursday as the trial of the former Utah doctor accused of murdering his wife continued.

Dr Martin MacNeill, a former Mormon Sunday school teacher, is accused of drugging and drowning his wife Michele MacNeill.

'Ever since the day my mom died, I was concerned that my father killed her. I've been fighting to get justice for this case ever since then,' Alexis Somers told the courtroom in Provo, Utah.

Her father, Dr Martin MacNeill, showed little emotion during the testimony.

Prosecutors have painted a picture of MacNeill as a liar who was hell-bent on making his wife have a facelift so he could dope her up with a cocktail of drugs during her recovery and then drown her in the bathtub. 

The motive was a woman named Gypsy Willis, who MacNeill had met online more than a year and a half before he allegedly killed his former beauty queen wife.

Willis was hired on shortly after his wife's death as a nanny, but oldest-daughter Rachel MacNeill testified that she knew that her father had a relationship with the new woman.

'It was obvious,' she said. 'She was just goo eyes at my dad and didn't do anything a nanny should do.'

During her testimony today, MacNeill talked about how she used to be close to her father.

'Growing up, my father was my best friend,' she said. 'We were a close family.'

But that relationship changed when he started acting strange following her mother's death. Hours after Michele MacNeill's death, her father started 'continually' bringing up an autopsy that would clear him of suspicion in her death.

'He didn't want anyone to think he murdered my mother,' said the oldest of eight siblings. She said she found her father's effort to clear himself jarring in 2007 when she was grieving her mother's unexplained death.

'It was so shocking to me,' Rachel MacNeill testified. 'I said, "Why would anyone think that?'"

She spoke haltingly, trembling as she tried to maintain her composure. The judge had to call a break early in her testimony when she was unable to speak. She avoided looking at her father in the courtroom.

Rachel MacNeill also described a family lunch after their mother's funeral that turned sour.

Her father was 'commenting on how he's a single man now, and he kept it very casual,' Rachel MacNeill said. 'He was making jokes about being single, and he was laughing. It made me sick. I left.'

Earlier on Thursday, Somers - who is also a doctor - said her father's account of how he found his wife unresponsive in the tub conflicted with other eyewitness accounts.

She is a guardian for the family's youngest daughter, a key witness in the case whose appearance at the trial awaits a ruling by the judge.

Somers said she never coached the then-6-year-old sister about what to tell police in Utah after the child found their mother in a bathtub.

Somers said she has kept the now-12-year-old sheltered from the news coverage of their mother's death.

'She is just a little girl, she shouldn't have to be expose to that,'

But Somers also knew that her little sister's testimony would be important and she believes that Ada suspects their father carried out the crime.

'Ask her, maybe she doesn't know,' Somers said.

Her testimony came during a special hearing held by the trial judge to determine if he'll allow Ada MacNeill, now 12, to take the witness stand.

Fourth District Judge Derek Pullan issued no immediate ruling as he resumed the trial on Thursday.

He is trying to determine if Ada MacNeill has her own independent memory of what happened when she was the first to find her mother unresponsive in the bathtub in 2007. Jurors were not present during the hearing.

MacNeill, 57, is accused of hounding his wife Michele MacNeill to have a face-lift then mixing a lethal combination of drugs for her recovery and helping her into the tub.

The trial is in its second week. It's expected to last at least one month.

On Wednesday, an emergency room doctor testified that MacNeill offered him $10,000 to keep trying to save his wife even though he was already working furiously to revive Michele MacNeill.

Scott Vanwagoner called the comment 'off-the-wall' and the oddest experience of his medical career.

Other witnesses have testified that MacNeill was acting erratically at the house, too, as paramedics worked to revive her before taking her to the emergency room.

Police previously testified to MacNeill's erratic behavior that night.

'He
 was hysterical. He was blurting out things like why did you have to 
have this surgery? Why were you on so many medications? Why God,' Dan Beckstrom with Pleasant Grove Police Department told the court.

Police
 and paramedics have testified that he had cursed his 50-year-old wife 
after they arrived for insisting on getting a face-lift then taking too 
much medication and falling into a bathtub.

The 2007 death shocked the Mormon community of Pleasant Grove, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City, because the suspect was a doctor and had been a church leader. MacNeill has since surrendered his medical license.

After
 MacNeill’s arrest in August 2012, sisters Alexis Somers and Rachel 
MacNeill told Good Morning America that they knew their father killed 
their mother, even when her death was first ruled to have been from 
natural causes.

‘We know he's guilty. We know he'll harm again. If he's let out he will come after us,' Rachel MacNeill said.

Plot thickens: The trial of Dr. Martin MacNeill, a Utah father of eight and Mormon bishop, will heat up Thursday as his children prepare to take the stand against him. First up is Ada MacNeill, who was 6 when she found her mother dying in the bathtub

against her father, Martin MacNeill (right), who is accused of murdering
 his wife in 2007 by drugging her and coaxing her into the bathtub

The
 women had long fought for police to re-open the case into their 
mother's death, certain their father had murdered after Michele 
MacNeill, 50, who was found drowned in the bathtub at their Pleasant Grove 
home in 2007.

'It's 
horrible to be happy about the arrest of your father, but finally he is 
being held accountable for murdering my mother,' Alexis Somers said.

Witnesses: Many emergency personnel have testified, including nurse Stephanie Hansen. A police officer also testified that MacNeill was out of control and hysterical as his wife was carted away
