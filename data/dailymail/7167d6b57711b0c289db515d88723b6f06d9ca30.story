Tesco chiefs made an ‘unreserved apology’ in court after one of its flagship stores was plagued by rodents.

Mouse droppings were found on the shop floor and on bakery packaging at Tesco Metro in Covent Garden, central London - where 55,000 shoppers flock each week.

Inspectors found what they described as a ‘super mouse’ in one of the food crates.

It was much larger than a standard mouse because it had been gorging on protein.

Food waste was also discovered across the store’s warehouse and storage areas, while the floors were covered in grease and dirt.

Staff also failed to fix doors, pipes and loose ceiling tiles allowing mice to enter fridges and food crates at the Bedford Street store.

Health inspectors also found dead rodents in the dairy section in the store warehouse which provided a ‘large risk of contamination’ to food, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.

Customers alerted Westminster City Council after spotting mice scurry across the shop floor on 23 March last year.

Environmental health officers warned staff there was a mice infestation, but the janitor was left to clean the store before a second inspection three days later.

Health inspectors then had to issue an emergency hygiene prohibition notice and close the store when they found that virtually no progress had been made.

‘During the inspection of the premises a number of breaches of food hygiene regulations were uncovered,’ said Paul Sharkey, for Westminster City Council.

‘The first visit by an environmental health officer was after a complaint was made by a member of the public about a mouse being sighted on 23 March 2012.

‘A further complaint was received from a member of the public on 26 March about pests in the store.

‘As this was the second complaint within five days, it was decided to visit the store again and see what progress had been made.

‘Two officers spoke to the store manager who said cleaning work had not been completed and that Rentokil should have been called which had not happened.

‘The officers then inspected the bakery and found a large number of mouse droppings on plastic storage boxes and 17 mouse droppings where pastry was kept.

‘Food debris was also found in the bakery on top of shelves.

‘There was poor pest proofing with the suspended ceiling often used by mice in the building as ‘runways’.

The horrid discoveries continued in the warehouse and kitchen areas, the court heard.

Mr Sharkey added: ‘The floor of the kitchen was very dirty. No cleaning had taken place since the first inspection three days before.

‘In the dairy area one of the officers was overcome with a strong smell of decomposing pests in the unit.

‘Mouse droppings were found on packaging of items in the bakery and on plastic containers.

‘Given the density of the mouse droppings, the officers decided that there was a large risk of contamination in the fridge.

‘There was clear gnawing of other packaging and pieces of raw chicken had been eaten.

‘There was multiple mouse droppings on the chicken.’

Mouse droppings and food waste were also discovered across the store's warehouse and storage areas, while the floors were covered in grease and dirt

The officers ordered the store, one of the capital’s busiest, to close under emergency measures.

A random inspection two days later had to be abandoned because mouse droppings were still found in the store’s shop and basement floors, the court heard.

Mark Watson, representing Tesco, said: ‘I make an unreserved apology on behalf of the company for the conditions of the premises and the offences that arose from these premises.

‘Its 3,100 stores do generally maintain very high standards.’

He added: ‘There was in the aftermath a full review of management structures and maintenance staff.

‘The store manager was replaced and full retraining of all staff took place.’

District Judge John Zani was shown pictures taken by health inspectors in which live mice could be clearly seen in certain snaps.

He said the store’s failing of the third health inspection proved that it had not put its customers first.

‘On a further inspection environmental health officers had to be sent away - a store that had 55,000 customers a week,’ he said.

‘If I were a member of the public I wouldn’t be bothered or concerned if it was the local manager’s fault.

‘If I contracted food poisoning there is no point saying: "I’m sorry - that manager wasn’t very good and has been replaced".

‘That manager was good enough to be employed by Tesco as of that date.’

Judge Zani could have fined Tesco up to £30,000 but decided his powers were insufficient and sent the case for sentence at Southwark Crown Court.

Council health inspectors also found mice on the shop floor and droppings were also left behind the pick ‘n’ mix counter and next to the crisps shelves.

A plastic bag used to cover a drainage pipe on the shop floor had also been gnawed away which meant mice were free to roam the stores while customers were shopping.

The court heard Rentokil had first identified the mouse infestation in January 2012 yet little had been done by store staff to get rid of the rodents.

Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, employs around 300,000 people in over 3,100 stores in the country.

The supermarket chain, which was recently embroiled in the horsemeat scandal, has been fined three times since 2008 for breaching food hygiene practices at stores in Cardiff, Ipswich, and Towcester, Northamptonshire.

Tesco will face sentencing at Southwark Crown Court at a later date after pleading guilty to six counts relating to food hygiene offences at the Bedford Street store.

Judge Zani could have fined the supermarket a maximum of £5000 on each of the six offences but a judge crown court will have greater sentencing powers.
