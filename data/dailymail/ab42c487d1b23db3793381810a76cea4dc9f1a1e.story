Bruce Jenner has reportedly moved forward his rumoured interview with Diane Sawyer to discuss his planned transition to become a woman.

The reality star is said to be readying the one-to-one as early as this weekend after his mother confirmed his transition news to Radar Online.

The website has now reported that he is in a hurry to get his own side of the story across to the respected ABC journalist.

Quick fix: Bruce Jenner has reportedly moved forward his rumoured interview with Diane Sawyer to discuss his planned transition to become a woman 

Veteran jouranlist: BuzzFeed reported that Diane Sawyer and ABC News were close to securing the first interview during which he will discuss his life-changing decision

'Bruce will shoot an interview with Diane this weekend to discuss transitioning from male to female,' a source said.

'Bruce realised that there’s no longer any need to wait since the family knows and the public is pretty much aware of what’s going on.'

BuzzFeed reported that Sawyer and ABC News were close to securing the first interview during which he will discuss his life-changing decision.

Bruce made the formal announcement to his large family last month which was filmed for a docu-series recording his journey from man to woman to be broadcast later this year.

The reality show will reportedly air on E!, the NBC Universal cable channel that has broadcast Kardashian-based reality shows since 2007. 

But not landing the Jenner interview has caused much strife in NBC's news division, reports Buzzfeed, because E!'c corporate sibling would have seemed the more obvious choice.

After months of speculation, Jenner's confirmed on Tuesday that her son is undergoing the transition to become a woman.

It has been a much-pondered topic in recent months, due to the Keeping Up With The Kardashian star's changing and increasingly feminine appearance. 

Supportive: Esther Jenner has opened up about her son's impending change

Speaking to RadarOnline, Esther Jenner said: 'I just learned about [his transition]. Bruce filled me in, and we had a very long, long, long talk about it.

'I have never been more proud of Bruce for who he is, himself as a father, as an Olympian, a wonderful public speaker. He instills enthusiasm in people. He's gifted.' 

She added that she was unaware of his wishes until very recently, but commented further that she is right behind him through his journey.

'I support him whole-heartedly. I just love him like I always have,' she revealed.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Bruce Jenner and is awaiting comment. 

This isn't the first time the 88-year-old has addressed Bruce's appearance and gender change.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline in November, following his divorce from wife Kris, she said: 

'I love him, no matter what. There's such raunchy publicity all the time. I don't know. I've brought this up to him on the phone when we've talked and he says "mum you can't believe this stuff", he said you can't pay any attention to this stuff and I said "well I want to tell you one thing Bruce, I don't care if what they're putting out is true or false, it's not going to change my love for you", and it's true that's exactly how I feel, but I don't like it.'

She did hold a frank opinion on his long mane of hair though: 'I hate his hair, I tell him it's ugly. That it's ridiculous.

'I just love him like I always have': Bruce has been given the promise of support from his mother ahead of his life-changing gender change

'I told him on the phone the other day, we were talking about it and I said "you know Bruce, you just turned 65 and you're wearing you're hair like you're a teenage rebel". He laughed, just cracked up, he doesn't pay any attention to me. He's always been single-minded and independent.' 

Previously, it was alleged that Kris Jenner 'freaked out' over his alleged plan to change his gender.

TMZ reported that Kris was utterly shocked when Bruce broke the news to his family. People's insider also claimed that not all of Bruce's children knew about his plans until recently: 'There was a lot they didn't know about their dad.'

However, as well as being supported by his mum, it appears that he actually has the full support of his entire family over the big change.

According to a report from People magazine, all the 65-year-old former Olympian's kids and even ex wife Kris all approve of his choice to live life as a female.

A source for the weekly said: 'The number one thing is they all support Bruce.

'Kris has been great and anything that says the opposite just isn't true. It's really a hard adjustment for her and a shock but she 100% supports him – the whole family does.'

The former gold medallist's big decision was confirmed by the same publication on Friday as a source claimed: 'Bruce is transitioning to a woman.

'He is finally happy and his family is accepting of what he's doing. He's in such a great space. That's why it's the perfect time to do something like this.'

The reality star has been pictured in recent days with manicured nails, smooth legs, longer locks and what appeared to be fuller lips. 

Stepdaughter Kim hinted at Bruce's transition last week when she told Entertainment Tonight: 'I think everyone goes through things in life, and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.'

She added: 'I think Bruce is very happy, the happiest I've ever seen him. Of course we support Bruce 100 percent.'

'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about, I just think it's his story to talk about, not really mine.' 

Bruce has six children from his three marriages - daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, with Kris Jenner; sons Brandon, 33 and Brody, 31, with ex-wife Linda Thompson; and daughter Cassandra, 34, and son Burt, 36, with ex-wife Chrystie Crownover.

And he has four stepchildren from his marriage to Kris: Kourtney, 35, Kim, 34, Khloe, 30, and Rob, 27.
