Anger: Mr Paxman reacted strongly to the Prime Minister's words last year

Jeremy Paxman has launched an attack on the Prime Minister for comparing First World War commemorations to the Diamond Jubilee.

The Newsnight host said the Great War should be remembered as a disaster, not ‘an excuse for a knees-up’.

He was referring to a speech in which David Cameron promised a ‘truly national commemoration’ to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war in 1914.

Mr Cameron added that he wanted ‘a commemoration that, like the Diamond Jubilee celebrations this year, says something about who we are as a people’.

But Mr Paxman, whose great uncle died in the War, said: ‘The commemorations should have almost nothing in common with the Diamond Jubilee, which was an excuse for a knees-up in the rain to celebrate the happy fact that our national identity is expressed through a family rather than some politician.

'Personally, I think Elizabeth has played a blinder as queen. But her dull and dutiful grandfather, George V, recognised that the person who should be commemorated at the end of the First World War wasn’t him, but the Unknown Soldier.’

He added: ‘The war was a  disaster which brought stress and grief to most families in the land: there were postboys who gave up their jobs because they couldn’t face the sight  of another mother answering the door and breaking down on receiving the telegram  with the awful news their son was dead.’

The BBC presenter criticised the Prime Minister’s language in this week’s Radio Times.

He said: ‘Our Prime Minister promised the First World War commemoration would be “like the Diamond Jubilee celebrations”. What on earth was he talking about?’

'Hazardous': Mr Paxman criticised many aspects of Mr Cameron's speech at the Imperail War Museum last year, but mainly the decision to compare remebering the  First World War to the Diamond Jubilee

Mr Paxman also disagreed with Mr Cameron’s description of the Imperial War Museum as ‘incredible’.

He said: ‘These occasions, when the Prime Minister escapes from his speech-writers, are hazardous.

Salvo: Jeremy Paxman launched his attack on David Cameron's language in the upcoming edition of the Radio Times

‘His address included the cloth-eared ambition to spend lots of public money to make the Imperial War Museum “even more incredible”.

‘The whole point of the place is its awful credibility.’

In his speech, made at the museum last year, Mr Cameron said the centenary would be a ‘personal priority’ and promised the museum £5million.

Calling for the nation to remember the ‘extraordinary sacrifice of a generation’, he also said the War helped shape Britain by prompting medical and technological advances.

He said: ‘For all the profound trauma, the resilience and courage that was shown, the values we hold dear and the lessons we learnt changed our nation and helped to make us who we are today.’

Mr Paxman said: ‘Not to recognise that it was one  of the most consequential events in our history would just be perverse.’

But he added: ‘A number of distinguished fellow citizens, like the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy and the thoughtful musician Brian Eno, are worried the events will turn into a “celebration” of war. Only a moron would celebrate war.’

Mr Paxman also criticised the use of Blackadder Goes Forth in school history lessons, saying of the Rowan Atkinson series: ‘It’s great – and moving – comedy. But it’s not fact.’
