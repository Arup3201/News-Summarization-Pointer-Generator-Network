Tottenham are pursuing a loan deal for Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck as Borussia Dortmund step up interest in his Old Trafford teammate Shinji Kagawa.

Tottenham are among a number of clubs keen on Welbeck but are one of his preferred options.

They will pursue a loan deal but know United, although reluctant to let players join their rivals, will consider a deal where Tottenham pay the England international's wages in full. Conditions would also be put in place where Welbeck would also be unable to play against them.

Kagawa, meanwhile, is the subject of renewed interest from Dortmund who are willing to offer £6m plus £1.25m in add ons to take the Japan international back to Germany. Valencia have also expressed an interest.

Tottenham are among several clubs interested in signing the England striker, who wants regular football away from Old Trafford. 

Pochettino, who clinched the signing of Federico Fazio for £8million from Sevilla on Thursday night, is also keen on Jay Rodriguez but the Southampton striker will not be fit until January and relations between the clubs were soured by a failed swoop for Morgan Schneiderlin.
