Killed: Northampton University student Nabila Nanfuka died in the nightclub

A university student was killed in a nightclub stampede as revellers were told their coaches home were about to leave without them.

Nabila Nanfuka, 22, is believed  to have suffered a heart attack after being crushed on a landing area halfway down a staircase as bodies piled on top of her.

Two others were critically injured in the tragedy, which happened at an ‘urban music’ night attended by students from all over the country.

Yesterday there were claims that the event at the Lava & Ignite club in Northampton was overcrowded and tickets had been oversold.

The stampede followed an announcement that students had ‘ten minutes to get on the coaches or they will go without you’ at around 3.30am yesterday.

A fire alarm was then also triggered, which caused the crowd surge to escalate further.

One 19-year-old who passed out in the crush said that when she regained consciousness, she saw the lifeless body of a woman trapped under other fallen clubbers.

The student, who travelled to the ‘Wickedestwickedest’ event from London, said: ‘People were pushing, pushing, pushing to get out. A lot of us just couldn’t breathe.

‘I ended up on my front, trying to find a gap to breathe through, but there were so many people on top of me.

‘Every time somebody was pulled out of the pile of bodies, more people fell forward on top of us. It was awful. I thought I was going to die.

‘I’m sure I passed out for a few minutes. When I came around, I saw a girl’s body below me, to my left.

‘Her eyes were closed and she had people lying on top of her. Everybody else was trying to move or screaming, but she was motionless.’

The event was attended by students from universities as far away as Canterbury, as well as others across Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Birmingham and the East Midlands.

Students paid £15 for a ticket to the event, which included coach travel.

But some of those attending alleged 
that although the event was a sell-out in advance, extra tickets were 
sold on the door, pushing the attendance well above the venue’s 1,300 
capacity.

By 1am, it was so busy staff were said to be turning away even those who already had tickets.

One clubber claimed as many as 2,000 people may have been inside by the end.

Miss Nanfuka, from Neasden, North-West London, was in the third year of a leisure and tourism degree at Northampton University.

Her best friend, Birungi Nakiwala, 
22, a law student at Essex University, attended the event and described 
feeling ‘suffocated’ in the ‘really overcrowded’ venue even before the 
crush.

She added: ‘Everyone was panicking about missing the buses.

‘There were hundreds of people rushing down the stairs and there was no other exit.  It was like a stampede.’

The event was in its fourth year and 
headlined by DJ DNA with other acts including DJ Kapital, Docta Cosmic 
& Fatz and Kopeman.

Tributes: Two women are seen fixing flowers to a pole outside the club following the death of Nabila Nanfuka

'It could have been any one of us': One message of condolence appears to have been written by someone inside the club last night

Miss Nanfuka’s family come from 
Uganda. Her brother Fahad, who works in the  music industry, said: ‘It  
sounds like something very, very irresponsible has happened here. What 
happened to my sister is wrong.

'Nabila touched so many lives. She was everyone’s friend.’

Yesterday two women remained critically ill at Northampton General Hospital.

Police, who are heading up a 
‘multi-agency investigation’ into the tragedy, said a third person was 
also injured in the incident.

A spokesman for Luminar, which runs the club, pledged to ‘cooperate fully with police to find out exactly what happened’.
