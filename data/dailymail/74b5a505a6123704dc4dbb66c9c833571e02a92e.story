A dog which was found wandering the streets has spent five months at a rescue home because he he can't  wag his tail at prospective adopters.

Gizmo the brown Staffordshire bull terrier has been at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home since he was found in North London in July.

But staff say he is scared of traffic, of the dark and even rain and has spent every day since he was rescued in his kennel waiting for someone to choose him.

Now they fear the lonely pup will never find a home because he is too scared to greet visitors.  

Ceiri O'Douglas, a spokeswoman for the dog home in Battersea, south west London, said: 'The problem is he doesn't sell himself very well. He just won't wag his tail at people when they visit.

'Most dogs will jump up and say hello but Gizmo doesn't - he's too shy.'

Rehoming assistant Sarah Parkinson quickly fell in love with the six-year-old stray and takes him home every night.

But as soon as she brings Gizmo back and he sees his kennel, he begins to cry.

Sarah said: 'Gizmo is an incredibly loving and affectionate dog but he's a total softie so kennels are proving really hard for him.

'He's frightened of traffic, of the dark and even rain - he screws up his face and tries to hide from it.

'It breaks my heart hearing him cry when I put him in his kennel for the day.

'It would be the best present ever for Gizmo to find a new home before Christmas.'
