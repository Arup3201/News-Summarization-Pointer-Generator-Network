A man behind a controversial revenge porn site has asked Google to remove links to stories critical of his seedy business from their search results.

Craig Brittain, whose website posted nude photos of women without their knowledge or permission, is seeking the removal of the articles on the grounds that they feature pictures of him that were used without his consent.

The 28-year-old's now defunct site, Isanybodydown.com,also allegedly charged a 'take-down' fee for victims who want their photos removed.

Craig Brittain, 28, who was behind a controversial revenge porn site, has asked Google to remove links to stories critical of his seedy business

The site was banned from posting or sharing revenge porn photos or video by America's Federal Trade Commission earlier this year.

Brittain sent a Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) take down to Google objecting to 23 articles remaining in their search rankings, according to the Daily Mirror.

In the notice, which is published online, he claims that images, statements and other identity information was used in the stories without his permission.

He states that it came from isanybodydown.com and his Facebook page.

The DMCA notice was received on February 9, but at present no action has been taken by Google. 

The DMCA is a US law that was created in 1998 to protect against copyright infringements. 

Brittain was alleged to have used 'deception to acquire and post intimate images of women' for isanybodydown.com, according to the FTC complaint.

Posing as a woman, he reportedly used websites such as Craigslist to obtain explicit photos, offering nude photos of himself in exchange. 

Men were also said to have given him photos of naked women, as a way to take revenge for being spurned.

The FTC says his site featured images of more than 1,000 people and he made about $12,000 while it was up and running. 

Isanybodydown.com was banned from publishing nude pictures without the consent of the subject last month

Last month Brittain agreed to not publish any nude pictures without the consent of the subject and to destroy his collection, the FTC said.

Speaking after the decision Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection said: 'This behavior is not only illegal but reprehensible.

'I am pleased that as a result of this settlement, the illegally collected images and information will be deleted.' 

 In a statement posted on the website after it was closed down Brittain of Colorado said: 'I want to apologize to those who were affected by Is Anybody Down. 

'I made a series of poor decisions, then tried to rationalize them, and made it even worse. 

'I am sorry for the damage that I caused to everyone that ended up on my website.

' I am making amends at every opportunity. I regularly volunteer for, and donate to charitable organizations (I encourage you to do the same!).

'I ask for your forgiveness. What I did was wrong.'
