It might seem like an impossible dream but a healthy, slender figure like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's can be yours (genes and length of legs permitting, of course) without embarking on a fad diet, feeling guilty about food or spending hours pumping iron at the gym.

That's what nutritionist-to-the-stars James Duigan, whose world famous Clean & Lean diet has picked up a host of celebrity fans from Elle Macpherson to David Gandy, Hugh Grant and, of course, Rosie H-W herself, says.

Duigan has just updated and rereleased
 his Clean & Lean plan for Kindle this month which promises to cut 
the binge-regret-diet-bingle cycle endured by dieters and give 
you a lean and lucious shape without bulking up or shrinking down.

The revised and updated Clean & Lean plan can be 
downloaded onto Kindles or iPhones and iPads using the Kindle app.

And
 even better for readers of Femail, Duigan has filmed a series of 
exclusive exercise videos, each targeting a specific problem area, just for us.

This 
week, bottoms are getting the star treatment. Watch in the weeks to come
 for other exclusive videos showing just how to improve your legs, tummy
 and arms.

Rosie is more than happy to show off the results of the Clean & Lean plan

In today's video, Duigan reveals three exercises which he promises will give you a 'perfect perky butt'.

The hip extension exercise will 'switch your butt on' by engaging the glutes, while the lying side leg raises give a 'incredibly effective exercise for working your butt without bulking up' he promises.

The final one, the mini band walking, is so effective he says that he trained an actress for a Hollywood action movie and 'after a month of doing this exercise her butt had lifted so much that they has to change her costume'.

In his book, The Clean & Lean Diet, Duigan also recommends a whole range of butt-boosting exercises including squats, lunges, and jumps.

Huntington-Whiteley met James several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast.

Said Rosie: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine.

'What I've learnt through working with James is that by focussing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I ever thought possible. Oh and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as flat as James can!'

Although
 it's loved by supermodels, Victoria's Secret girls and film stars, Duigan says that the real magic is 
that is can work for anyone, from housewives to office workers and 
everyone in between.

Common sense: James Duigan's Clean & Lean plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up

The 
diet has never been advertised, but those who follow it (and who follow 
Duigan's workouts, which he teaches from his London gym Bodyism, 
recently voted as best in the business by Tatler) become enthusiastic to the point of
 fanaticism, making the Clean & Lean plan popular through word of 
mouth alone.

It recommends fresh food, as close to 
its natural state as possible. No refined sugar, which Duigan describes as like a 'toxic fat
 bomb' for your waistline. Cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the
 morning. Rely on 
natural, nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a rollercoaster
 of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end 
in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant, whether 
that be coffee, carbs, sweets or wine. And yes, ditch the booze.

right, British model David Gandy is also a fan

In his new book, Duigan explains that he came up with the term 'clean and lean' to describe the 'ultimate approach to achieving the perfect body. The word 'clean' here means a body that can deal  effectively with toxins - one that can deal with few that sneak in (via a glass of wine or a chocolate bar) and flush them out successfully.'

In his years of studying nutrition, says Duigan, he has discovered that while you can live off processed low-fat food and diet colas for a while your body will be so toxic that you'll find it hard to keep the weight off.

'People come to me who have tried every single diet out there, yet they can't stay slim for long. They cut carbs, they count calories, they ban whole food groups and they spend their lives weighing and measuring out food,' he says.

'But this type of dieting is a complete waste of time: it might help you to drop a dress size or tighten your belt for a while, but you'll gain it back eventually because your body will still be toxic and it's unsustainable - who wants to live like this? And so the cycle of dieting, feeling miserable and deprived, losing and gaining weight continues.'

Instead, Duigan says we should enjoy our food, but make sure that rather than processed foods, we eat healthy, natural foods and avoid ones laden with sugar.

Clean foods are those that:

James says:

'Sugar is designed to hook us in. It comes in the forms of pretty pink cupcakes, fluffy marshmallows, light sponge cakes with jam in the middle and creamy chocolate. It looks and smells delicious. But in reality, there's almost nothing to love about refined sugar. It makes us put on weight, increases the size of our liver (a bad thing), makes us unwell and ages us inside and out, leaving us tired, fat and wrinkled.

'As well as being highly addictive, refined sugar drags valuable nutrients out of our body, and it's the number one reason why, for the first time in history, children of this generation are predicted to die younger than their parents. WHY SUGAR IS PHYSICALLY ADDICTIVE

Sugar has a similar effect on the brain to pain-killing drugs like morphine and opther opiates (such as heroin). These drugs produce an almost instant feeling of pleasure, calm and satisfaction, making them incredibly addictive.

When the food manufacturers figured this out, they began producing foods full of sugar. Back in the 1950s, sugar would mainly be found in homemade cakes, but now it's pumped into almost all of the processed foods, alcoholic and soft drinks and even so-called 'healthy foods' (such as breakfast cereals) and foods aimed at children. Many of us turn to something sugary for 'energy' - and technically, it is a form of energy. But it's a bad type. So yes, you will get a qcuik burst after eating a chocolate bar, but about ten minutes after that you'll feel even more tired than you were before.

That's because sugar quickly hits the bloodstream, creating a rapid rise in blood sugar (a 'spike'). But, just as quickly, you then crash (due to insulin being produced from the pancreas), leaving you exhausted. A far better way of getting energy is to eat complex carbohydrates (low-GI fruits, berries), clean & lean proteins, vegetables, drink plenty of water and exercise regularly. If you do all these things, you won't need to rely on something as toxic as sugar to keep you energised.

WHY SUGAR IS EMOTIONALLY ADDICTIVE

For most of us, when we were growing up, sugary foods were used as a 'reward' by our parents, grandparents and almost everybody else we knew as children. Is it any wonder that by the time we reached our teens we'd learnt to associate sugary foods with happy times and making ourselves feel better?

Serves 4

INGREDIENTS

2 tomatoes, halved

1 broccoli, cut into florets

4 fresh organic eggs

Parmesan, for sprinkling

rocket, to serve

METHOD

1. Heat the grill to high and place the tomatoes under it for a few minutes until coloured.

2. While the tomatoes are cooking, steam the broccoli for 3-4 minutes under just tender, then set aside.

3. Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to the boil. Stir the water rapidly to create a whirlpool and crack the first egg into the centre; the swirling water should bring the egg together. Repeat with the remaining eggs (3-4 minutes is sufficient cooking time).

4. Serve each egg with the broccoli and grilled tomato. Grate a little Parmesan over the top, and scatter rocket over the plate.
