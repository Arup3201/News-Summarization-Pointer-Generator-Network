Massimiliano Allegri is on the verge of being named as the new coach of Juventus, according to reports in Italy.

Gazzetta dello Sport and Turin-based sports newspaper Tuttosport report on Wednesday that the former AC Milan tactician has agreed a two-year deal with the Serie A champions to replace Antonio Conte.

Three and easy: Juventus cruised to a third successive Serie A title last season

Conte, who was under contract with Juve for a further season, surprisingly stepped down on Tuesday just one day into the Bianconeri's pre-season preparations.

The 46-year-old Allegri has been out of a job since being dismissed by Milan in January, with the Rossoneri in the midst of a nightmare season when they trailed Juve by as many as 30 points.

The difficult campaign at Milan does not appear to have damaged the coaching prospects of Allegri, who joined the San Siro outfit in 2010 after two successful seasons in charge of Cagliari.

The Tuscan-born tactician led the Rossoneri to the Scudetto and the Italian Super Cup in 2010-11, his first season in charge, and was voted by his peers as 2011's Serie A coach of the Year.

Conte led Juve to a third consecutive title in the 2013-14 campaign, the first time the club has achieved the feat since a five-season title run in the 1930s.

He is widely expected to become Italy's new coach. Cesare Prandelli resigned after the Azzurri exited the World Cup at the group stage in Brazil.
