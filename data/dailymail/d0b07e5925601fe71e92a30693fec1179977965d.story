'Divisive': Patients are left in corridors outside wards they should be in while waiting for a free bed

Hospitals are being encouraged to park seriously ill patients on trolleys in corridors to ease the A&E crisis.

Doctors say the controversial practice of ‘boarding’ – which amounts to letting wards overflow – is already being used at a number of under-pressure hospitals in England.

It involves putting patients on trolleys outside the wards they should be in while they wait for a free bed instead of keeping them in A&E.

Rather than criticising the measure, desperate A&E doctors say boarding should be used more widely – even though they concede it is ‘potentially toxic’. They argue it is necessary to free up space in overcrowded casualty units.

As a result, doctors at the influential Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) have now given boarding their backing.

But critics question its safety, amid fears that giving the green light to boarding could serve to legitimise overflowing NHS wards.

Dr Adrian Boyle, an A&E consultant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge and a prominent RCEM member, argued it was better to have patients waiting on corridor trolleys, after they had been seen and assessed, than languishing outside A&E in queuing ambulances.

Between mid-December and mid-January, there were 11,203 occasions across England – more than 350 a day – in which ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because A&Es were full.

Casualties are often crammed because patients cannot be shifted elsewhere in the hospital due to lack of beds – a situation called ‘exit block’. Studies show that when A&Es are crowded, patients fare worse and death rates can rise.

Dr Boyle said: ‘Boarding spreads the risk across the whole hospital, rather than concentrating and multiplying it in the emergency department.’

He admitted it was ‘potentially toxic and divisive’ but said an ‘exceptional response’ was needed to ‘exceptional circumstances’. Dr Boyle said that ‘a handful’ of hospitals now use boarding during busy periods, but he would not name them. A spokesman for Addenbrooke’s said they did not use the practice.

Dr Boyle was speaking at a conference organised by the RCEM, which is advocating greater use of boarding. With hospitals – and A&Es in particular – getting busier every year, he said action had to be taken to better manage the rising flow of patients.

‘If we get a trend like this going on into next winter, it’s going to be like Armageddon,’ he warned.

Emergency doctors also see boarding as a way of making their hospital colleagues realise the problems they are facing. Dr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant at St Thomas’s Hospital in London, said: ‘It is not acceptable to have people waiting in the emergency department, out of sight of the rest of the hospital.’

But many medics have serious reservations. Dr Chris Whale, clinical director of Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said there was ‘pretty much no evidence’ that boarding was safe in NHS hospitals.

He said: ‘For a Royal college to advocate this is fairly hazardous, without the evidence base to support it.’

The Mail on Sunday has been campaigning for almost three years to stop the closure of A&E units.
