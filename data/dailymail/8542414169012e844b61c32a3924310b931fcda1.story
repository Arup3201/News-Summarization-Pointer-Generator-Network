A hair stylist from New York is smartening up the city's homeless by giving them haircuts on his day off.

Mark Bustos, 30, usually works at a trendy salon in Manhattan where he deals with glamour models and sexy photo shoots, but he has found a unique way to give back to the city.

Every weekend, he wonders the city's streets to find people who look as though they could do with a haircut and who might otherwise not be able to afford it.  

Mr Bustons experience in hair-styling goes back to when he was a teenager. At the age of 14 he was styling out of his parent's garage.

A goat herder in Jamaica: This man was trying to make a little extra money by charging tourists to come see his goats. Bustos isn't sure whether he was homeless, but he was definitely in need of a haircut

Mark Bustos: His motto is simple: 'Be awesome to somebody' 

Bustos, who kicked off his hairstyling career at age 14 out of his parents' garage, said that he's 'never made a penny in my life (that) hasn't had to do with hair

They don't always know when their next haircut will be. Most times they ask me to buzz it all off… Til we meet again….

His haircuts for the homeless was inspired after taking a trip in May 2012, to his native country of The Philippines where he snipped away on underprivileged kids.

He said the trip gave him the idea and momentum to continue the good deeds back in the States.

'The feeling was so rewarding, I decided to bring the positive energy back to New York City.'

He has also done the same for poor people living in Jamaica, Costa Rica and Los Angeles.

'I do believe people with a proper, professional haircut receive more respect than those who do not have a proper haircut,' Bustos told Today.

'Having a proper haircut also gives the recipient much more confidence.'

The first thing this man asked Bustos after his haircut was: 'Do you know anyone that's hiring?'

The transformations seen after a simple haircut and shave are incredible. Bustos says that people are treated better when their hair is styled neatly

'He didn't say much during the haircut,' said Bustos about Jamar, who he found outside a homeless shelter. Afterwards, when he looked in the mirror Jamar asked, 'Do you know anyone who is hiring?'

'He actually had his own buzzers but they were all rusty and weren't working anymore, so he said it was perfect that I showed up. He asked me to buzz all his hair off because he didn't know when his next haircut would be.'

'Red,' as he is known by his friends, is a war veteran who can almost always be found sitting on his wooden stool at the corner of the Bowery and Rivington Street in Manhattan

After getting his hair cut and his mustache cleaned up, James said he now has the confidence to start looking for a job again -- starting with some nearby hotels.

Along the way, he's posted some of his customers' cuts on his Instagram feed

Sometimes Bustos says he can walk around for hours looking for a haircut recipient on the streets

Bustos strolls the streets of New York most Sundays to continue the tradition he started in the Philippines and later duplicated in Jamaica, Costa Rica and Los Angeles

His friend and professional photographer Devin Masga takes photos of his work and posts them to an Instagram account.

The transformations are often incredible.

'I've decided to have photos taken in an attempt to inspire others to do great things for fellow human beings,' he said.

Bustos explained that he does his services in open spaces not for people to see him, but for others to be inspired to do a good deed to the needy.

'Even a simple smile can go a long way,' he added.

Bustos says he always cuts hair in public so people can find inspiration in good deeds

In the past Mark Bustos said he didn't take photos of his haircuts, but now he does because he wants to inspire others to do great things for fellow human beings

Bustos says the haircuts don't just make people look good on the outside but also feel good on the inside

Bustos has been offering free haircuts every Sunday since May 2012. His girlfriend often comes along and brings the 'clients' food

Mark Bustos may work in a high-end hair salon in New York but once a week he takes to the streets to give homeless people free haircuts
