Furious: Teenager Nikki Brewer (pictured) was left in a wheelchair after a brutal attack by a drunken thug

A woman left needing a wheelchair following a street attack will never see justice done after a mix-up by police and prosecutors allowed the man to avoid court.

Nikki Brewer, 21, was walking home with a friend after a night out when she was confronted by a drunken yob.

Footage caught on a CCTV camera showed him grabbing her hair and yanking her head back before delivering a powerful punch that sent her sprawling to the ground in Colchester.

Mrs Brewer now suffers permanent back pain and often needs a wheelchair to get around. Doctors have also diagnosed a degenerative disease affecting her nerves which was probably triggered by the injuries she sustained.

Police appealed for witnesses on BBC’s Crimewatch and a 31-year-old man was arrested in January this year for common assault.

But he has now been told he will not face prosecution as he was not brought before magistrates within a six-month time limit that applies to summary-only offences.

If he had been charged with a more serious offence, such as actual bodily harm, no time limit would have applied.

The exact reason for the delay was mired in confusion yesterday as Essex Police and the Crown Prosecution Service blamed each other for failing to take action.

The force said it was given advice by the CPS that Mrs Brewer’s injuries were not serious enough to warrant arresting the suspect for the more serious offence.

It also claimed prosecutors had 
decided not to proceed with the case – but the CPS responded by saying 
it had never been handed a file of evidence.

‘This man is still out there and could
do the same thing to someone else,’ said Mrs Brewer, an administrator 
for the Multiple Sclerosis Centre near her home. ‘It is so frustrating 
that he has been able to walk free.’

Mrs Brewer, who is married to therapy 
co-ordinator Lee, 22, was 18 when she was attacked on Colchester High 
Street in April 2009. The thug spat at her friend and when she 
remonstrated he grabbed hold of her.

Another man at the scene – wearing 
what looks like an orange bib – is believed to have been a friend of the
attacker. He has never come forward.

Mrs Brewer suffered concussion and a 
black eye in the assault. But doctors later discovered a degenerative 
condition that may have been triggered by the incident.

This left her joints enlarged and pushing on her nerves, leaving her in agony.

As a result, she has to use a wheelchair to reduce the stress walking puts on her back.

Mrs Brewer also accused police of 
failing to act quickly enough because they appealed for witnesses on 
Crimewatch only in September 2010.

Essex Police said that the CPS had 
decided not to proceed with the case. A spokesman added: ‘The man 
arrested on suspicion of common assault has been released from bail by 
police.’

A police source later said the CPS had
advised that the information available did not meet the ‘evidential 
requirement for an actual bodily harm case’ – meaning they had to 
proceed with a common assault case.

A CPS spokesman said: ‘A file in 
relation to this incident has never been submitted to us, so we were 
unable to make a decision or offer any formal charging advice in respect
of this incident.’
