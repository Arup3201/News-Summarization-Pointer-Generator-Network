When One Direction's debut fragrance, Our Moment, was launched in August 2013 it broke records to become the fastest-selling fragrance of the year.

Its huge success - which saw one bottle fly off the shelves every minute in the run-up to Christmas and reported sales of £72m - has inspired One Direction to launch a second offering.

Directioners will be thrilled to know that Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne and Niall Horan have announced the release of their latest special edition fragrance, That Moment.

That Moment describes itself as a 'distinct and mature scent that blends green apple and cucumber for a fresh a fruity aroma adding a touch of peony, and violet and a hint of cedarwood to offer all the excitement of new beginnings'.

Each ornate pink glass bottle is finished with a silver crown, which is designed to add a regal touch and complement the uplifting and refreshing tones of the fragrance, say the boys.

Speaking in a video to announce the 
news, Harry Styles said: 'Your reaction to Our Moment has been 
absolutely amazing.

'We're so, so pleased that you guys like it so much, 
and people have already been asking what is next for Our Moment so we've
 come up with a new version of Our Moment.

'It
 comes with some of the original notes but with some new stuff, so 
it's taking things like pink grapefruit and jasmine and mixing them with
 new scents like apple and violet in a swanky new bottle,' he explains.

The
 fragrance news comes on the same day that One Direction's Midnight 
Memories was named the best-selling album globally in 2013.

 by BPI confirms that the X Factor stars' latest album sold four million
 copies in just five weeks, taking them past Eminem's Marshall Mathers 
LP to the top of the list.
