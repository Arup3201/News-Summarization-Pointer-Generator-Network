Google Play has been forced to remove a Boyfriend Tracker app from sale in Brazil in response to complaints about privacy abuses, as well as its potential to be used for extortion or stalking.

Brazilians were outraged when they learned their country was a top target of the 
U.S. National Security Agency's top secret overseas spying operation, but it seems that all bets are off when it comes to catching cheaters.

Tens of thousands managed to download the software before it was pulled off the market.

Boyfriend tracker: Google Play has taken the controversial app off the market in Brazil

'Brazilians are a jealous people, what can I say? Of course it's going to be 
popular,' said Marcia Almeida, a 47-year-old woman in Rio whose marriage ended 
seven years ago in large part because of what she said was her husband's 
infidelity.

'It's a different type of spying,' she said of comparisons to the NSA 
surveillance program. 'You're checking up on somebody you know intimately, not 
some stranger.'

The app, called Rastreador de Namorados - Portugese for Boyfriend Tracker - 
promises to act like a 'private detective in your partner's pocket.'

Functions include sending the person doing the tracking updates on their 
partner's location and forwarding duplicates of text message traffic from the 
targeted phone.

Spyware that works via GPS is marketed as a way to keep 
children safe or find lost phones, but a growing number of apps claim users can conduct NSA-level surveillance for less than a 
cup of coffee.

There 
are now apps available that allow you to read a partner's text messages,
listen in on calls, and check calendars.

Some even remotely turn on a microphone so users can listen in to what their lover is doing at any time.  

For $8 per month, Stealthgenie promises to deliver all of the above functions and be  undetectable.

Other apps, like Spy Your Love, ironically claim to work on a 'trust system'.

The idea is that each member of a couple agrees to constant mutual
monitoring of call histories, SMS and Facebook 
communication.

Others are more brazen. Cheating Boyfriend  bills itself as 'great for 
suspicious boyfriends or the stalker on the go.'

Then there are technologies like GPS Tracking Pro that are, in theory, marketed to parents.

But in practice, who knows whether the person installing the app is watching her son after school or her boyfriend after work?

Almost all websites 
for products have disclaimers warning people not to use their products 
for illegal purposes.

The definition of 'consent', it seems, is crucial.

In
2011 Japanese company Manuscript was forced to modify their Boyfriend 
Log app after complaints that the app ran in the 
background without users knowing.

In 2009 the Supreme Court ruled that 
police attaching GPS devices to cars was 'unreasonable search and 
seizure,' and some states have laws against cyberstalking.

But for private citizens, GPS on phones remains a legal grey area.

It's the subject of a federal bill to close the loophole, but companies that create the apps insist that the technology is meant for legal monitoring.

So the husband listed on your family plan or the boss who gave you the 
company smartphone may be within his rights to keep tabs on you.

The
app market saw record growth in 2013, and there are now a number of anti-spyware options as well.

There is even a command that allows a user to force the target 
phone to silently call their own, like a pocket dial, so they can listen in on 
what the person is saying.

Similar apps are marketed for smartphone users in other countries, including 
Europe and the U.S., but Boyfriend Tracker is the first that has made any impact 
in Brazil, a country still irate as it learns more about Washington's snooping.

Brazil has sent a government delegation to meet with U.S. leaders about the spy 
program that was revealed by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who has 
been on the run since May and was recently granted asylum in Russia.

Google spokeswoman Gina Johnson said by email that as a policy the company 
doesn't comment on why apps are removed.

Critics say even as advertised, apps like Boyfriend Tracker can violate 
privacy rights, and they warn that in the wrong hands they could be used for 
more sinister purposes, like stalking.

Some in Brazil argue it breaks an 
anti-online harassment and hacking law in place since April.

The law is named 
after Brazilian actress Carolina Dieckmann, who had nude photos of herself 
leaked by hackers in 2012 after she refused to pay about $5,000.

However, similar apps popular on Google Play market themselves to parents as 
a means of monitoring how teenage children use the phone and where they are at 
any given moment.

Matheus Grijo, a 24-year-old Sao Paulo-based developer behind Boyfriend 
Tracker, says it has attracted around 50,000 users since its launch about two 
months ago.

Mr Grijo insists his lawyer vetted the app and determined it does not violate 
any Brazilian laws. Despite being removed by Google, it is still available via 
direct download from his company's website.

A disclaimer on that website stipulates the app is for 'social and recreational use' and absolves the developer of responsibility for any misuse.

The first line of the download instructions says a woman installing the tracker 
on her boyfriend's phone should do so ' with his consent'. 

'We are waiting for Google's position on the removal of Boyfriend Tracker 
from Google Play, which we consider an error,' read a posting on a Facebook page 
Grijo set up for the app.

To install Boyfriend Tracker, suspicious partners have to get their hands on 
their loved one's smartphones and upload the app.

A free version leaves the 
app's icon visible on the target's phone, while a version that costs $2 a month 
masks the icon.

Mr Grijo said the app began as a joke between him and his girlfriend but the 
idea quickly caught on among their friends.

'In Brazil, we have this culture of switching partners really quickly, so 
this is a way of dealing with that,' said Grijo.

'People really appreciate 
having a tool to help them find out whether they're being cheated on.'

He acknowledged that 'of course some people are against it, but on balance 
the response from users has been positive.' 

He said he's received messages of 
gratitude from around 50 people who used the app to ferret out their partners' 
infidelity.

While cheating in Brazil cuts both ways, the app is clearly marketed to women 
suspicious of their male partners, right down to the name. Postings on the app's 
Facebook page exhort: 'Girls, share this.'

Still, Mr Grijo insisted he personally has never given his girlfriends any 
reason to worry.

'I've had three steady girlfriends until now but I've never had these kinds 
of issues,' he said.
