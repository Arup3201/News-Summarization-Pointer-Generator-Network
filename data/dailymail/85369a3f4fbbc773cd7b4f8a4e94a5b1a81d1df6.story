A new poll conducted by NBC News/ The Wall Street Journal found that 40 per cent of Americans prefer that their children don't play football.

According to the survey, there is a large gap based on household income of whether or not people worry about their children playing football or not.

About half the poll-takers in the highest income bracket (more than $75,000 per year) said they'd opt for their children to play a different sport.

40 per cent of Americans polled said that they didn't want their kids to play football

Of those in the lowest income bracket (less than $30,000 per year) only 28 per cent said that they wouldn't want their child playing.

The poll comes out just in time for Super Bowl weekend and also was tallied at the same time an ongoing lawsuit regarding football players and sports related injuries is gaining lots of attention.

Last Year the NFL reached a $756 million settlement in a lawsuit with thousands of former players who sought coverage because they were suffering from concussion related injuries.

Two weeks ago, a federal judge denied the settlement because the amount may not be enough to cover the seemingly infinite medical costs for the 20,000 retired players.

The poll also asked about the NFL's efforts to prevent concussion related sports injuries. 20 per cent said they don't think the NFL is doing enough to prevent injury.

Quarterback Brett Favre has spoken out about his own sports related injuries and has said that he would be 'wary' of his child playing football

2,000 retired players are seeking money from the NFL to pay for their medical bills-and a federal court said $765 million isn't enough

41 per cent said they felt the NFL has taken appropriate action to avoid the concussions.

The Mail Online covered a story in November about Brett Favre and how he has spoken out about the danger of Concussions from football and how coaches did little to nothing to protect players later in life.

Favre has been tackled 525 times, more than any other quarterback, and is starting to feel the negative effects on his brain.

In an interview with a Washington D.C. radio station in October, the ex Green Bay Packer said that he was unable to remember an entire summer of his daughter playing youth soccer.

Favre also told Matt Lauer that if he were to have a son he may not want him playing the game. The interview with Lauer will air on Monday.

'I would be real leery of him playing football. In some respects , I'm almost glad I don't have a son because of the pressures he would face,' Farve told Lauer.

President Obama recently told New York Magazine, 'I would not let my son play pro football.'
