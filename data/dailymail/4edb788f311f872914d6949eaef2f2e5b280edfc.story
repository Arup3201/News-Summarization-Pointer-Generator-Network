QPR striker Charlie Austin has been announced as the Barclays Premier League player of the month for December - the fifth forward in succession to land the award this season.

The 25-year-old has been in inspired form for Harry Redknapp's side so far this season scoring 13 goals in all competitions - including five goals in as many games in December. 

That included goals against former side Burnley and Arsenal, as well as a match-winning hat-trick against relegation rivals West Brom at Loftus Road.

As well as that Austin created one assist, and made 71 successful passes in the R's six fixtures, during which he featured for 435 minutes. 

After receiving the award Austin spoke to QPR's official website underlining his delight.

He said: 'To win awards like this is very pleasing. I just try to work as hard as I can and score as many goals as I can for QPR.

'But it's not all about me – it's a team game – and my team-mates deserve as much credit as I do for this award.
