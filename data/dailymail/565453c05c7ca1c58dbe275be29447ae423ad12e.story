Shocking footage has emerged of a bus driver appearing to smoke cannabis while driving a bus before he crashes into a home in Sydney's west.

The Penrith Magistrate's Court today released dramatic CCTV footage bus driver Shaun Murphy, 57, taking what is believed to be synthetic cannabis from a bag, putting it in a pipe, and then lighting it up and inhaling it.

At one point in the CCTV clip, Mr Murphy is shown steering the bus with his knees and elbows so he could have another drag of the drug.
