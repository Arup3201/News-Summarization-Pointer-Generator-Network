West Ham co-owner David Sullivan admits the West Ham board and manager Sam Allardyce disagree over the future of Ravel Morrison.

Allardyce is happy to sell the 21-year-old but Sullivan says the club want to keep him.

‘Sam has said Ravel is not part of his plans but we as a board see him as part of our plans,’ Sullivan told talkSPORT.

Difference of opinion: While Allardyce doesn't want to keep him, West Ham want Morrison to stay

‘We would like to sit down and give him a longer contract. We do like him and do see him as a long term part of the club but we have to agree it with the manager because there is no point signing a player he is not going to play.’

Sullivan is also confident of agreeing a deal for defender Winston Reid. He added: ‘I think we will get to a deal with Winston. Both balls are in the air with regards to Winston and Ravel but both are players we like very, very much.’
