The nurse found dead after a hoax call to the hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge left three notes, a court heard yesterday.

The body of Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was discovered in her room in staff quarters last Friday.

Two notes were found nearby and a third was among her possessions.

The mother of two had also sent a number of emails and made telephone calls that police believe might help explain what happened.

During a five-minute hearing at Westminster Coroner’s Court yesterday it was revealed that attempts were made to revive the nurse but they were ‘to no avail’.

Detective Chief Inspector James Harman said: ‘Jacintha Saldanha was found by a colleague and a member of security staff. Sadly she was found hanging. There were also injuries to her wrist. The London Ambulance Service was called to the scene. At this time there are no suspicious circumstances.’

Scotland Yard detectives are examining the notes, as well as interviewing Mrs Saldanha’s friends, family and colleagues at London’s King Edward VII hospital.

Mrs Saldanha, a night sister, was the senior nurse on duty when she took a call at 5.30am on Tuesday from Australian DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who were pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles.

She unwittingly transferred the call to a colleague, who described in detail the condition of Kate, who was being treated for severe morning sickness.

Mr Harman told the hearing detectives 
had been in contact with colleagues in New South Wales and would be 
taking statements from those involved in the prank call.

A mass will be held on Saturday for Ms Saldanha at London's Westminster Cathedral.

The
 mass will be offered 'for the repose of the soul of Jacintha and her 
grieving family', a spokesman for Westminster Cathedral said.

'We would hope to hold a more formal memorial after the inquest has concluded.'

Mrs Saldanha’s accountant husband Ben 
Barboza, 49, identified her body. Coroner Fiona Wilcox opened and 
adjourned the inquest until March 26.

Mrs Saldanha, who was born in India, 
lived in London during the week and returned home to Bristol to be with 
her family at weekends.

Mr Barboza and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 
14, had been expecting her home for the weekend and were apparently 
unaware of her role in the hoax call.

Labour MP Keith Vaz, who has been 
representing the family, said they could expect the results of a 
post-mortem examination within four days.

He added: ‘The family is very grateful
 to the coroner’s court for the way they have dealt with the matter and 
they are extremely grateful to the Metropolitan Police.

‘As you know they are very upset and they are grieving and they are comforting each other.’

A memorial service is due to take 
place in Bristol tonight and a mass is to be held for Mrs Saldanha at 
London’s Westminster Cathedral tomorrow morning.

The mass will be offered ‘for the 
repose of the soul of Jacintha and her grieving family’, a spokesman for
 Westminster Cathedral said. He added: ‘We would hope to hold a more 
formal memorial after the inquest has concluded.’

Southern Cross Austereo, the parent 
company of Sydney-based 2Day FM which broadcast the hoax call, has ended
 Greig and Christian’s Hot 30 show and suspended prank calls across the 
company.

Last night it was revealed Mrs 
Saldanha’s family have been offered bereavement counselling in their 
home city of Bristol by the King Edward VII hospital.

In a letter to John Lofthouse, the chief executive of the private hospital, Mr Vaz says the family will take up this offer.

A
 full and searching inquiry was launched by Australia’s media watchdog 
today into the royal radio prank, following which nurse Jacintha 
Saldanha committed suicide.

The
 Australian Communications and Media Authority has powers to compel 2Day
 FM’s parent company, Southern Cross Austereo, to name those who 
approved the infamous hoax going to air.

The
 authority will look into whether the radio station complied with their 
broadcasting licence conditions – and insiders said today that if the 
findings were against the station it could lose its licence.

Presenter: 2Day FM DJ Mel Greig is pictured (right in left photo) with her sister Alana Munday (left in left) in Adelaide in April 2011 - and (right) at Oakbank Racecourse in South Australia in the same month

The
 authority’s chairman, Mr Chris Chapman, said it would be examining 
‘whether the licensee has complied with its broadcasting obligations.’

Miss
 Saldanha took her life just days after receiving a hoax phone call at 
London’s King Edward VII hospital from Sydney DJs Mel Greig and Michael 
Christian.

She and 
another nurse in the ward where Kate Middleton was being treated for 
morning sickness believed they were talking to the Queen and Prince 
Charles, despite the unimpressive attempts by the DJs to imitate the 
royals.

Although 
Austero has repeatedly apologised for the ‘tragic, regrettable death’ of
 the nurse and has committed at least $500,000 (£326,000) to a memorial 
fund for her family, the media watchdog has shown its determination to 
dig deeper into the scandal.

It is expected to demand who was working at the time the hoax was perpetrated and who approved it.

Those who will be questioned, it is understood, will be producers and lawyers who were on duty, or on call, at the time.

Austereo
 has been in damage control ever since the death of nurse Saldanha, 
including permitting the two DJs to appear on Australian tv and, amid 
their tears, express their sorrow for the tragic consequences of their 
hoax call.

The watchdog
 will be referring heavily to the radio broadcasting code, particular a 
part which states that it is a breach to record a person in 
conversation, and also air it, without their knowledge.
 Section 6.1 of the code states that ‘a licensee must not broadcast the 
words of an identifiable person unless that person has been informed in 
advance or a reasonable person would be aware that the words may be 
broadcast.’

The section
 adds that there must not be a broadcast unless, ‘in the case of words 
which have been recorded without the knowledge of the person, that 
person has subsequently, but prior to the broadcast, expressed consent 
to the broadcast of the word.’

The
 station’s parent company has said it attempted to contact the hospital 
five times following the hoax call to discuss it, but had not been able 
to speak to anyone.

The
 company has not explained why it still went to air with the recording 
even though it had not been able to reach anyone at the hospital 
following the prank.

It
 is understood the hospital has written to Austereo demanding to know 
how it has arrived at a figure of $500,000 to be given to the nurse’s 
family – and has given it until tomorrow to reply.
