Two front teeth will be on West Coast Eagles midfielder Elliot Yeo's wishlist this Christmas.

The 20-year-old's pearly whites were snapped off after a brutal blow during Saturday's clash against Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The moment where Yeo's two teeth are seen flying from his mouth in opposite directions was captured on camera.

The loss of the teeth happened when West Coast midfield Elliot Yeo had a run in with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts

Yeo came off second best after his mouth came in contact with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts' shoulder.

The midfielder and ruckman collided after Yeo failed to take an easy mark, the ball slipping through his grasp, right before the half-time siren.

In the video, the midfielder falls to the ground and looks to be assessing the damage done to his mouth.

It was reported by afl.com.au that trainers were unable to find the teeth.

The midfielder continued playing for the rest of the game and tweeted after it: 'All I want for Christmas is two front teeth...'

Despite the blow, Yeo shook off the injury and soldiered on, earning the respect of his coach.

'It was a big knock … he should have taken the mark,' Eagles coach Adam Simpson told afl.com.au.

'He kept on going, I don’t know if he was in a hell of a lot of pain or not, but he didn’t seem to take a backward step after it.'

Unfazed by the incident, Yeo was in good humour after the game and fired off this cheeky tweet

Yeo played the second half and ended the match with 19 disposals and a goal in the Eagles' eventual eight-point loss to the Magpies.

After the game, Yeo tweeted a cheeky reference to the knock: 'All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth...'.

The roots of his teeth remained in his mouth and will be capped this week.
