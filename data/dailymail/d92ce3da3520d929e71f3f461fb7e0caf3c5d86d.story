It may not seem like it, considering how many details are leaked on a weekly basis, but Apple is a highly secretive firm.

And it is so concerned details about its Watch will be released before its event on Monday, reports claim it has set up a secret lab that’s completely shut off from the world.

Sources have revealed that developers from firms such as Facebook and BMW have been invited to the lab to fine-tune their apps – but can’t even take pens and paper into the room.

Reports claim Apple has given developers early access to its Watch (pictured). The likes of Facebook and BMW have been invited to a Cupertino location and asked to fine-tune their apps in secretive labs in which pens, paper and anything else from the outside world is banned

The claims were made to Bloomberg’s Adam Satariano and Tim Higgins by unnamed ‘people familiar with the process’ who had signed non-disclosure agreements.

Apple is holding a media event on Monday where it is expected to announce more details about the availability, price and software for the Apple Watch.

The wearable was first unveiled at last year’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch but it’s still not likely to launch until at least April at the earliest.

Like with its iPhone and iPad apps, Apple has strict guidelines about how apps on the Watch should work. Within these guidelines, Apple is said to be advising developers to design applications to be used for no longer than 10 seconds at a time. Boss Tim Cook is shown at the iPhone 6 event in September

In particular, BMW, Facebook and United Continental Holdings were mentioned in the report.

Internet access is blocked inside the room, the developers have to bring source code for their apps on a drive that can’t leave the complex, and they can’t discuss the plans with anyone.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications

The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.'

Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list.

The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen.

Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches.

The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom.

Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications.

It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.

Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them.

There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. 

Siri is also built into the Apple Watch.

Apparently, Apple boss Tim Cook wants developers to consider how much their apps send notifications to users to avoid the wristband vibrating constantly and ultimately draining the battery.

For example, Facebook’s Instagram has added a feature that only sends a notification when a certain user posts a photo.

Some app developers have already released interactive demos about how they predict the watch will work.

Apple reportedly experimented with sensors that measured conductivity of the skin but 'these features didn't perform consistently' enough

News tracking site Pipes, for example, recently gave a glimpse into how menus will appear and how news stories will be managed.

And hardware-wise, an Italian designer has created a website that lets people mix and match the colours of the Apple Watch case and band to experiment with different looks.

Mixyourwatch shows the different combinations from leather to steel bands and gold and steel cases. 

According to reports, Apple experimented with sensors that measured conductivity of the skin. 

The results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch was being worn. 

These would have been used to track stress levels and monitor heart-rate. 

But 'these features didn't perform consistently on some people, including those with hairy arms or dry skin' and the plans were said to have been subsequently dropped.
