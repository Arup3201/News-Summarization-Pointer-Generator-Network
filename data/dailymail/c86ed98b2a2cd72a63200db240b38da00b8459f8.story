The latest spell of warm, spring-like weather will continue throughout the weekend as temperatures are predicted to hit 19C tomorrow well over double the March average of 9C.

Forecasters say the weather on Sunday will continue to be dry and warm for the south-east - with lengthy spells of sunshine.

The pleasant weather in the south will continue well into next week - but north and westerly areas will see cloudy conditions and maybe even rain on Monday and Tuesday.

The spell of warm weather in the south is expected to last until at least the end of the month.

It is in stark contrast to this time last year when winter rolled on until the middle of the month. Blizzards left motorists stranded in 15ft snow drifts in Cumbria, while Belfast was blacked out after a storm hit the city’s power network, and temperatures plummeted to -6C (21F).

York basked in the early 'summer' sunshine as forecasters said temperatures will reach 19C this weekend and the warm weather is set to last to the end of the month

Now pear trees at RHS Wisley in Surrey are in full blossom a month earlier than usual, which experts say is a sign that it could be an excellent year for all fruit.

RHS fruit expert Jim Arbury said: ‘This is one of the earliest I can remember pears coming into blossom and might mean an early fruit harvest all round.’

While the past three months have been remarkably wet, the unseasonably mild temperatures have meant plants and wildlife were ready to wake when the good weather arrived.

The early flowering is a big boost for butterflies and bees at the end of their winter hibernation.

Retailers are also poised to take advantage of the unseasonably warm weather. Asda said sales of shorts have jumped 300 per cent in the past few days, barbecues are being snapped up and even sales of swimwear have risen 9 per cent.

Supermarkets
 said sales of burgers were up 121 per cent compared to this time last 
year, and sausage sales up 38 per cent.

Yesterday the RSPCA sounded a note of warning about the weather, saying it could be dangerous for pets.

In comments more commonly heard during a summer heatwave, RSPCA chief vet James Yeates said: ‘A hot car can be a death trap for dogs, it is as simple as that.

‘Sadly, too many people still don’t appreciate how dangerous it can be to leave a dog in a hot car, conservatory or caravan.’

Met Office spokesman Laura Young said: ‘It is going to be warm and dry for most of the country, apart from parts of Scotland.

‘We
 could see up to 17C or 18C (63-65F) on Saturday, and Sunday will be the
 best day of the week – very sunny, particularly in the South.

‘We could possibly see 19C (66F) in and around London on Sunday.

‘The
 good spell of weather should last until Wednesday, when it breaks, but 
the high pressure system will build up again and it looks like next 
weekend could be nice again.

‘Early indications are that it is looking fairly stable for the rest of March and we should have plenty of warm days.’

Meanwhile, the unusually warm conditions
 has meant that ripe English strawberries are in stock a week earlier than 
they were a year ago, prompting soft fruit sales at Waitrose to rise by 
12 per cent.

Garden plants 
sales are also up, and gardeners will have plenty of time to bed their 
new plants in as long sunny spells are forecast for most of Britain 
tomorrow and Sunday, and the weather is not expected to break until 
Tuesday.

A Met Office spokesman said the warm conditions - the south of England is forecast to be hotter than Cairo and Algiers this weekend - were a far cry from last March when the average temperature for the month was just 5.1C.

Forecaster Nicola Maxey said: 'We are looking at temperatures in the mid to high teens, reaching 19C on the south coast tomorrow, with just showers of rain in the north west of Scotland.'

Sunday will be dry and sunny, although a little cloudier than Saturday, and temperatures should stay relatively high until early next week, when they will drop back to 10C or 11C.

A Waitrose spokesman said: 'This weekend’s mild temperatures are reflected in our sales figures, with burgers up 121 per cent, sausage sales also up 38 per cent, and a 700 per cent increase on our sales of garden plants compared to this time last year.'

Managers at Tesco said they were expecting a rush on sausages, ice cream and berries, while at Marks and Spencer they said ice cream sales had already doubled on this time last week.

Meanwhile, the improving weather conditions meant that the owner of a car which was submerged during the floods has been reunited with it after two and a half months.

Hubert Zajaczkowski, 21, abandoned his Seat Toledo near Muchelney, Somerset, on Christmas Eve when water levels rose knee-deep, and he had to escape by climbing out through the window and onto the back of a passing Land Rover.

Over the next few weeks the water levels continued to rise until all but a small patch of the car's roof was visible, a patch that was seen by Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Charles as they toured the flood-stricken area by boat.

The car, which was stuck in a flood in Muchelney, Somerset, became a symbol of the devastation suffered in the west country by this winter's floods

Mr Zajaczkowski, 21, said he found an inch of mud teeming with maggots, worms and leeches when he was finally able to get back into his flooded car after 11 weeks

Now the water has subsided and Hubert, from Shepton Mallet, was finally reunited with the Seat he bought two years ago for £600.

He said: 'It was there for 11 weeks in the end, but this week we managed to get to it and put it on a truck to be taken away - there is nothing worth saving and it is going to be scrapped.

'There was about an inch of gunk at the bottom and it was full of worms, leeches and bugs.'
