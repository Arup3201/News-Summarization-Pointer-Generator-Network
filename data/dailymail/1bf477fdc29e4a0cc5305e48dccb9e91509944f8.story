Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall began the last leg of their Royal tour of the Middle East today with a trip to an equestrian centre in Oman where they were treated to the rare sight of a bright pink horse.

The Royals visited Nizwa, south west of the capital of Muscat, where they were taken by horse and carriage to an equestrian centre to watch a display by skilled Omani riders and to see the rare pink stallion Khadi.

Charles was evidently impressed by the rare horse as the pair took to their seats alongside Omani officials and their aides.

Royal greeting: Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall arrive at a cavalry event on the eighth day of a tour of the Middle East in Muscat, Oman

Regal carriage: Prince Charles and Camilla were taken into the military equestrian centre arena in a horse-drawn carriage to view a display and to see the pink stallion

Peachy horse: The British royals were treated with a display of Khadi the pink stallion at the equestrian display in Nizwa, Oman

Pride of Oman: Khadi the pink stallion is a rare type of albino which sees his bright pink skin shine through underneath his short summer coat

Will you look at that! Prince Charles was clearly impressed by Khadi's rare colour

Seeing pink horses: Charles and Camilla saw Khadi the pink stallion today

Khadi the pink stallion gets his 
unusual hue as a result of a rare albino condition which sees his bright
pink skin shine through underneath his short summer coat.

After the equastrian visit, the pair 
arrived at the Nizwa fort. Waving a sword in the air and swaying to the 
music, the Prince of Wales fully embraced a traditional Omani dance when
he visited a fort this morning.

As
the Prince entered a courtyard within the castle, a group of musicians 
struck up a song and filled the air with the sound of singing and drums.

Charles, along with the Duchess of Cornwall, stood in the middle of the group as they performed sword tossing and mock fighting.

He was then handed a blade, as well as a shield, and began to shuffle and wave the sword mimicking their dance.

The Royal couple are on the fourth and final leg of a tour of the Middle East taking in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman.

Yesterday the Duchess of Cornwall said she has been moved to 'see behind the veil' during her three-day trip to Saudi Arabia.

Speaking during a visit to a 
female-only centre which offers training and job opportunities this 
morning, Camilla said she believed huge strides had been made in 
empowering women since she last visited almost six years ago.  

The Mail's Royal Correspondent was 
the only journalist allowed to accompany the Duchess on her tour to the 
centre in Jeddah.

She told us exclusively afterwards: 'I've noticed 
from the last visit I made here in 2006 - five, six years ago now - a 
sea of change.

The
fort, called Nizwa, is located in the heart of Oman and dates back to 
the 12th century. It is the country's most visited national monument.
