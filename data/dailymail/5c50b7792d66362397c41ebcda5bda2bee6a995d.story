As Rosie Huntington-Whiteley stripped down to flaunt her enviable figure for her latest lingerie line for Marks & Spencer, tongues were wagging as to how she keeps her perfect body in shape.

And while she is known for her love of yoga and regular gym sessions, the Victoria's Secret Angel has also divulged another of her secret health weapons.

The 25-year-old tweeted a picture of herself praising her ‘delicious green juice' which she described as 'a great way to start the day.' But what’s behind this mysterious concoction? Along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber, kale and parsley, the Japanese wholefood Chlorella is added to the juice.

Just juice: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has revealed that she loves Chlorella (like those pictured right) green juices

And it’s not just Rosie who’s caught the Chlorella bug, fellow Victoria’s Secret Angel Miranda Kerr has admitted that she takes Chlorella supplements to keep her skin in check.

Chlorella is being dubbed the new Creme De La Mer but without the celebrity price-tag.

Enviable figure: As well as regular gym and yoga sessions, Rosie takes the supplement as an added health benefit

It’s an entirely natural and balanced, single-celled, green algae, which, due to combination of nutrients and amino acid abundance, chlorella is linked to healthy nails, skin and hair.

Our bodies cannot produce these nutrients, so they must be obtained through diet instead.

And the handy tablets forms are much easier to swallow than the nine cups of spinach (270g) you would need for the equivalent iron content or the 32oz steak you’d need to eat for that much B12.

The powerful combination of key nutrients in chlorella also help to detox and cleanse the skin and body, and also improve energy, sleep, hair and prevent nail ridges and splitting.

And Rosie's little secret weapon costs a lot less than a pot of luxurious face cream Creme De La Mer.

Sun Chlorella, a supplement similar to the one found in Rosie's magic juice, is priced £21.95 for 300 tablets.
