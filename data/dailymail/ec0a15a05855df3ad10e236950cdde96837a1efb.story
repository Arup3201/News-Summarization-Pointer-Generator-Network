Every child's first birthday is a milestone occasion, and one that is celebrated by delighted parents.

But for premature baby Shayne Welsh, his first birthday is not only a milestone, but a miracle.

Shayne was declared dead by doctors for 25 minutes after he stopped breathing - but miraculously came back to life.

He stopped breathing in an incubator a day into his life, after being born at just 26 weeks, when he failed to breathe without the help of a ventilator.

Survivor: Kerry holds Shayne when he is just a month old at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton

Doctors and nurses battled to stabilise Shayne as he fought for life struggling to breath with his barely formed lungs

Miracle boy: Shayne looks on at his first birthday cake - which no one expected after his heart stopped for 25 minutes

Tiny Shayne Welsh was born weighing just 1lb 14oz but has since gone from strength to strength

Nurses at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, could not revive him and informed parents Kerry, 39, and Simon Welsh, 44, the toddler had passed away.

But as they prepared for a chaplain to christen the baby they noticed he still had a faint heartbeat and rushed him back into intensive care.

Now he has celebrated his first birthday surrounded by family and friends, overjoyed he has developed so fast he is the same as any other one-year-old boy.

Kerry and Simon from Walsall, West 
Midlands, who had been trying for a baby for 18 years and had six 
miscarriages said his life was meant to be.

Kerry
said: 'The nurses told us he had gone and that there was no vital signs
of life. I asked them to keep trying but they said it was no use.

Tiny: His parents were devastated to learn their little boy had died - but his heart started beating again and the little boy, seen here aged one month, grew stronger and stronger

What a trooper! Shayne plays happily just before his first birthday last week, a year after he was given up for dead

Boy wonder! Shayne has celebrated his first birthday surrounded by family, who are overjoyed he has developed so fast he is the same as any other one-year-old

'We held him for 20 minutes taking it in turns and saying our goodbyes thinking we’d lost Shayne forever.

'They said there might still be movement in him from the gasses in his body but he was there and just still. We had no idea he would start breathing again.

'We wanted him christened and as they took him away the nurses rushed back a few minutes later and said he was breathing again.

'We watched them rig him back up to the ventilator and oxygen.

'I just turned around stunned and I literally slid down the wall in shock.

'Simon and I couldn’t believe it. We think it was maybe moving him so much in preparation for the christening that re-started his heart.

After 18 years of trying for a baby, Simon and Kerry were thrilled when Shayne - seen here in a high dependency care - pulled through

Milestone: Simon, Kerry and Shayne at his christening, months after nurses told them that their little boy died

'Being that small how could he survive? At that age you haven’t developed proper lungs. It’s amazing he came back.

'The nurses said he’s fighting back but we just don’t know how long for.

'It was still 50/50 for weeks he would make it through but he did.'

He has has been labelled ‘the event’ by staff at the hospital after the amazing back from the dead incident that doctors say they have never witnessed.

Medics can still not understand how Shayne, who weighed just 1lb 14oz at birth, had the lung capacity to breathe again after his heart stopped.

But after reviving him and keeping him on a ventilator and oxygen for the eight weeks after the incident, he pulled through to now live a healthy first year.

Nothing gets in his way: Tiny Shayne died in an incubator a day into his life at just 26 weeks old and nurses could not revive him - but now he is fighting fit after his miraculous recovery

Growing up fast! Shayne, seen at nine months old at his playgroup, 'fought all the way and he¿s here now a beautiful baby'

He also survived four blood transfusions, bleeds on the brain and a hole in the heart which is common to premature children.

Kerry and Simon first lost a child in 1996 but did not discover until 2001 that Kerry had polycystic ovaries that meant it was unlikely she could be pregnant with a child for longer than 37 weeks.

Despite the concerns, she endured a normal pregnancy with Shayne for six months until September 12 last year when he arrived with no warning.

Kerry said: 'I had back ache and doctors said they suspected it was an infection and to put my feet up and get some rest.

Shayne will have tests for the next four years on his eyes and ears to ensure his early arrival in life does not hinder his development

Kerry said: 'After 18 years of heartache and even the second day of his life and what we went through, I wouldn¿t change it for the world'

'Within hours though I was fully dilated and they said the baby’s head is ready to arrive. It was a bolt from the blue.

'They said he had a 60 to 70 per cent chance of survival but it all depended on him breathing on his own.

'I never bought anything baby wise in the lead up to his birth, I didn’t want to tempt fate and we chose not to know if it was going to be a boy or a girl.

'Before we conceived they told me the more weight I lost the better the chance I would have of mothering a child so I set about losing as much as possible.

'We lost twins in 2002 and then had four other miscarriages.

'But after 18 years of heartache and even the second day of his life and what we went through, I wouldn’t change it for the world.'

Shayne was allowed home first time on November 30 last year, 11 weeks after his remarkable recovery.

He has only had to return once since for a bout of tonsillitis.

He will have tests for the next four years on his eyes and ears to ensure his early arrival in life does not hinder his development.

Otherwise, he now happily plays at his local nursery with children his own age.

Kerry said: 'If you don’t tell people, they’d never know just how premature he was. He was crawling and sitting up before many children his age do and he’s all set to start walking in the next few weeks.

'The hospital was fantastic. We cannot praise the staff there enough for they did for us and Shayne.

'He fought all the way and he’s here now a beautiful baby.

'We hope this gives hope to people that their premature children can survive.'
