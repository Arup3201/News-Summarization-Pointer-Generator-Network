It might not look out of place in a private gym – but for the various straps to keep the occupant in place and the hospital drip stand looming ominously behind.

Pictured is the notorious restraint chair at Guantanamo Bay, where former inmates claim they were subjected to long hours of agonising forced feeding.

The US military is still using the chair to cope with a hunger strike by 104 of the 166 prisoners which has lasted more than three months.

Force-fed: The restraint chair used to force-feed detainees on hunger strike at the detainee hospital in Camp Delta which is part of the U.S. military prison for 'enemy combatants' in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba

Strike: A military doctor holds a feeding tube used to feed detainees - a hunger strike which started with a handful of prisoners, has now become a mass protest with 104 detainees taking part

Legal black hole: The detainee hospital's operating room - Guantanamo, a US military base in Cuba, has previously been criticized as being a legal black hole where inmates have fewer rights than those who are held on mainland US soil

Each day, up to 40 of them are strapped down and kept alive with a liquid nutrient mix fed through a nasal tube.

Medical experts have described the 
practice as unethical and dangerous, and even Barack Obama has condemned
 it, saying in his national security address: ‘Is this who we are? Is 
this something that our Founders foresaw?’

But officials insist ‘enteral feeding’ is considered safe and its use has been upheld by the courts.

Under the procedure, an inmate who 
refuses nine successive meals or whose body weight drops significantly 
is offered a twice-daily can of a nutritional supplement, Ensure, whose 
flavours include butter pecan. If he refuses, guards shackle him into 
the chair by his arms, head and feet, and a nurse inserts the tube up 
his nose, down the back of his throat and into his stomach.

Up to 44 are strapped down each day and force-fed liquid nutrients through a nasal tube. 'We do it to preserve life,' Navy Capt. Robert Durand. said, denying the assertions from prisoners that the procedure is painful

Pick a face: A chart used at the detainee hospital for patients to indicate their pain level

Most prisoners are taken to designated
 ‘feeding cells’ but a few are fed at the Cuban base’s detainee 
hospital, where these photographs were taken. They are asked to point to
 one of six happy or sad faces on a card  to indicate their discomfort 
level.

Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel, a Yemeni 
who has been on hunger strike since February after 11 years at 
Guantanamo, recently described how he wanted to vomit when the feeding 
tube was first stuck up his nose. ‘There was agony in my chest, throat 
and stomach,’ he said.

Ahmed Zuhair, a 47-year-old former 
inmate, recently described how four years of being regularly strapped to
 what he dubbed the ‘torture chair’ had damaged his back and nasal 
passages.

Brick wall: Calls for the doctors who force-feed hunger striking prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to refuse to perform the practice on ethical grounds have gotten no traction, a spokesman for the prison said earlier this month

Checks: A U.S. Army Military Police officers check in on detainees during morning prayer at Camp V. Camp V and VI,  are where most of the detainees are held. There is also a third, top secret detention facility called Camp VII or Camp Platinum where 'high-value detainees', including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, are kept

Zuhair, a Saudi former sheep trader 
who was never charged with any crime during a seven-year stretch at 
Guantanamo which ended in 2009, said his nose would bleed during each 
force-feeding. He claims he would be forced roughly into the chair and 
left there much longer than the official two-hour maximum. ‘The pain 
from each force-feeding is so excruciating that I am unable to sleep at 
night because of the pain in my throat,’ he said in a sworn statement.

US military officials have 
acknowledged a ‘forced cell extraction team’ was repeatedly used to move
 Zuhair when he refused to walk on his own to where hunger striking 
detainees were fed.

Back up: The military had about 100 medical personnel treating the prisoners before the strike began expanding rapidly in March but has since added reinforcements, bringing the total to nearly 140

A military spokesman said the feeding tubes are lubricated and prisoners are offered anaesthetic to prevent long-lasting damage.

‘We think there are adequate 
safeguards in place to make it as pain-free and comfortable as possible.
 It’s not done to inflict pain and it’s not done as punishment. It’s 
done to preserve life.’ The pictures were taken by the Getty agency 
after it was granted a request to visit the base. Its photographer was 
not allowed to see any patients.

Three doctors writing this month in 
the New England Journal of Medicine called Guantanamo a ‘medical 
ethics-free zone’ and urged doctors there to speak out. ‘Force-feeding a
 competent person is not the practice of medicine; it is aggravated 
assault,’ they said.

In April, the American Medical Association said force-feeding detainees violated the profession’s ‘core ethical values’.

US Marine General John Kelly, who 
oversees Guantanamo, sparked criticism when he denied detainees were 
being force-fed, calling it ‘Hunger Strike Lite’.
