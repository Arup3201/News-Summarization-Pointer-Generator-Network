A woman in Ferguson, Missouri, spoke out Friday saying that a month before the Michael Brown shooting, she had a run-in with officer Darren Wilson in which the cop allegedly hurled obscenities at her and made threats to arrest her.

Wilson was identified earlier today by Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson as the officer who stopped Brown, 18, last Saturday for blocking traffic and ultimately shot him eight times.

During a live interview with CNN presenter Don Lemon, a young woman who did not give her name said that Officer Wilson once told her to 'shut the f*** up’ and ‘sit the f*** down' as she was trying to wash mace out of her eyes.

Run-in: The woman said she was maced a month ago and walked into a store to wash her eyes, but Officer Darren Wilson told her to 'shut the f*** up' and threatened to arrest her if she poured milk in her eyes to ease the sting of pepper spray

The woman said that she went inside the QuickTrip grocery store in Ferguson about a month ago to get help after being pepper-sprayed in the face under unknown circumstances.

Employees at the store let the woman use their sink to clean her eyes and suggested that she use milk.

As she was pouring the dairy product in her eyes, the woman said police officers walked into the convenience store and ordered her to get out.

‘I came outside and I was trying to pour milk in my eyes and Wilson told me if I poured milk in my eyes, I was going to be arrested,’ she said on CNN.

‘And I was trying to tell him that my eyes were burning because I was maced, but he told me to “shut the F up.”’

The officer then allegedly made the woman sit on concrete as he took down her information.

When she renewed her efforts to treat her eyes with milk, she said Wilson again told her to 'shut the f*** up and sit the f*** down.'

‘I was looking at his name tag and I was telling myself that I would never forget who he was and what he did to me,’ said the woman. ‘And I prayed on it and I asked God to get revenge on him.’

For nearly a week, the police officer who shot and killed the unarmed black teenager has been a shadowy figure — nameless, faceless and seemingly shielded from the fury that has filled the streets of the town he was sworn to protect.

On Friday, the community finally learned his name — Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white officer who has spent the last six years patrolling the St. Louis suburbs, drawing praise from his boss.

Ferguson Police Chief Jackson provided the name and said Wilson had not been the focus of any public complaints. He declined to offer many details about Wilson's life or career but commended his police record and his demeanor.

'He was a gentle, quiet man,' Jackson said. 'He was a distinguished officer. He is, has been, an excellent officer for the police department.'

Wilson has been on administrative leave since the August 9 shooting.

According to a report by USA Today, no one answered the door Friday at Wilson's home in Crestwood - a town 18 miles from Ferguson - and a police officer guarding the property said that the family had left the area days earlier.

A neighbor told the paper that Wilson, described as 'tall and slim,' was often seen walking his dog.

Public records obtained by The Washington Post indicate that as a teenager, Wilson was an honor roll student at Charles High School. He lost his mother at age 16.

Neighbor Martha Arnoldy, the wife of the Crestwood police chief, told The Post that Wilson and his family are in a 'safe place.' 

The officer reportedly packed up and left his house so quickly that laundry was left hanging in the backyard.

Wilson's friend Jake Shepard told CNN he could not imagine the officer killing somebody.

'I can say without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements that, at that moment in time, he was scared for his life,' Shepard said.

'He's just the last person on Earth that you would think to do something like that. It's just shocking.'

The friend described the 28-year-old man as a quiet yet caring person with a 'huge heart' who would give the shirt off his back to anyone in need.

Police said Wilson stopped 18-year-old Michael Brown and another young man because they were walking down the middle of the street. He ordered them onto the sidewalk.

Authorities say one of the men pushed Wilson into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with him over the officer's weapon.

Police
 released CCTV images today of a 'strong-armed' robbery taking place at a
 store in Ferguson minutes before teen Michael Brown was shot. Police named Brown as the primary suspect in the 
robbery

Ferguson
 police on Friday released these surveillance images which showed two 
men stealing a $50 box of cigars from a convenience store shortly before
 midday last Saturday

At least one shot was fired inside the
 car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Wilson shot 
Brown multiple times, according to police.

Chief
 Jackson said early Friday that Officer Wilson did not know Brown was a 
robbery suspect when he stopped him for blocking traffic - but he later 
offered a different story.

The
 Ferguson police department has released CCTV stills of the convenience 
store robbery, which took place minutes before the shooting, showing a 
suspect whose clothing and stature matched Michael Brown.

Speaking later in the day, the police chief claimed that Officer Wilson 'made the connection' between the store hold-up and Brown when he saw a box of cigars in his hands that had been reported stolen.

Wilson is 'devastated' by last weekend's events, the police chief said. 'He never intended for any of this to happen.'

The killing touched off day after day of violent protests, which were met by an aggressive police response that included officers in riot gear pointing assault rifles, firing rubber bullets and unleashing tear gas.

On Thursday, the governor ordered Missouri State Police to take over security in Ferguson. Within hours, the tension in the streets began to ease.

But during a protest Friday night, chaos once again reigned on the streets of Ferguson as angry demonstrators threw bottles and blocked traffic, prompting police to hurl smoke bombs and issue an order to disperse.

officer who shot Brown was unaware that a robbery had taken place

Wilson spent the first two years of his career with the police department in nearby Jennings, Missouri, before moving on to Ferguson for the past four years. Ferguson's police force is nearly all-white. The town's population is about 70 percent black.

Jackson had originally planned to release the name earlier in the week but delayed the announcement, citing safety concerns and death threats against the officer.

St. Louis County police and the FBI are conducting separate investigations.

The St. Louis County prosecutor said it will probably be weeks before a decision is made on whether to charge Wilson with a crime.

The
 officer who shot Michael Brown won a commendation for 'extraordinary 
effort in the line of duty' in February, it was revealed today.

Darren
 Wilson, 28, was nowhere to be seen at his white middle class home in 
the suburb of Crestwood where he moved just a year ago. It was claimed 
he'd left the single-story brick home 'days ago'. No one answered the 
door when MailOnline knocked on the door and there were two or three 
police cars parked outside.

Neighbors told USA Today that he was 'tall and slim' and was often seen walking his dog.

Another
 neighbor, Ron Gorski, told USA Today: 'He's a young guy,' Gorski said 
of Wilson. 'Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for 
the family and the entire country.'

Wilson,
 who is on paid administrative leave, won a commendation for 
'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February, according to NBC's Tom Winter.

He has spent four years in Ferguson and two previous years in the Jennings district, said Winter.

Ferguson
 police chief Thomas Jackson said the shooting had been 'devastating, 
absolutely devastating' to Wilson, adding: 'We had no complaints about 
the officer. He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He has been an 
effective officer.'

According to public records, his mother died in 2002. Wilson has a sister and a half-brother.
