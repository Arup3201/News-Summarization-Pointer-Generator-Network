'Thrill kill': Colin Lowrey, 22, is charged with what prosecutors say was the 'thrill' killing of 23-year-old Las Vegas woman Cherish Pincombe on October 22 as a still unknown person watched on video chat site

A Nevada Army reservist will stand trial for murder in the October 22 ‘thrill kill’ in which he shot his friend in the head as an anonymous stranger watched on a video chat site.

Colin Lowrey, 22, told police he and Cherish Pincombe were using the worldwide video chat website Omegle.com at his Henderson home when the 23-year-old Nevada woman was killed.

Authorities say somebody in the world witnessed the shooting, but they don’t know who.

Lowrey is charged with knowingly killing Pincombe despite telling police he believed the gun was not loaded.

The Las Vegas Review Journal reports 
that police subpoenaed Portland, Oregon-based Omegle.com for footage of 
the chat turned deadly.

They received snapshots, but only of chats that involved Pincombe, Lowrey, and one of Lowrey’s three roommates, Patrick Duffy.

Officer
Chad Mitchell, who responded to the scene and interviewed Lowrey and 
his roommates, said the snapshots revealed little because ‘everything 
looked happy.’

None of Lowrey’s roommates actually saw the alleged crime. But Mitchell maintains there was at least one witness.

And they saw it on their computer monitor.

Murdered? Pincombe was shot in the head with a .45 caliber handgun at close range at Lowrey's Henderson, Nevada home. She was rushed to an area hospital and died shortly thereafter

'Somebody saw the gun discharge': Police and Lowrey say there was an active chat window open on the worldwide video site Omegle.com, but the witness could be anyone, anywhere in the world

‘Somebody saw the gun discharge,’ he testified in a Henderson court on Monday. ‘There was an active chat going on.’

Lowrey told police Pincombe’s death was just the unfortunate outcome of a game gone terribly wrong.

He
told detectives he and Pincombe were chatting with a girl who said she 
was from Norway. He said she asked if they had any guns.

That’s when he retrieved a rifle and a .45 caliber handgun.

Prosecutors said at the Monday hearing they are ‘looking at this more as a ‘thrill kill’ than an accidental death.’

Lowrey’s
roommates testified that everyone in the house, including Lowrey, had a
playful relationship with Pincombe. Duffy told the court he’d never 
seen Pincombe angry at Lowrey.

Premeditated? Lowrey, a Nevada Army reservist, told police he didn't know the gun was loaded when he pulled the trigger but investigators believe that he slipped a magazine into the handgun unbeknownst to Pincombe

Mystery: Lowrey claims the deadly game began when they were chatting with a girl from Norway, who asked the Americans if they had any guns. But he says that's not who saw the gun go off

Lowrey’s
attorney Stephen Stein used the testimony in an attempt to argue his 
client should be tried for involuntary manslaughter.

‘I heard no evidence whatsoever of premeditation, and I heard no evidence whatsoever of malice,’ Stein said.

The judge disagreed and ordered he be tried in on an open murder charge.

Lowrey remained in jail in lieu of $200,000 bail. An arraignment was set for December 10.

He claims he left the weapon with Pincombe and then went to the bathroom. When he returned, he says she asked him to point it at her head, presumably as a joke.

‘Without her asking, he decided he would pull the trigger,’ Mitchell told the court of Justice of the Peace Rodney Burr.

While Lowrey claims he still thought the gun wasn’t loaded, investigators think he likely took it with him to the bathroom where he inserted the magazine.

By the time Pincombe was shot, Lowrey
believes they were chatting with someone new, not the girl from Norway 
who started the deadly game.

But as of Monday’s hearing, investigators were still at a loss as to who that witness was.

Unknown witness: Police subpoenaed Omegle to get footage of the chat, but received only snapshots in which 'everyone looked happy.' Lowrey's roommates testified that everyone in the house, including Lowrey, had a good relationship with Pincombe. None of the roommates witnessed the gun discharge

Whoever it was, he or she did not technically witness a death. Pincombe died shortly after arriving at an area hospital.

It was Lowrey who called 911. He reported that a gun had accidentally discharged in his home and wounded a woman.

Prosecutors said at the Monday hearing they are ‘looking at this more as a ‘thrill kill’ than an accidental death.’

Lowrey’s roommates testified that everyone in the house, including Lowrey, had a playful relationship with Pincombe. Duffy told the court he’d never seen Pincombe angry at Lowrey.
