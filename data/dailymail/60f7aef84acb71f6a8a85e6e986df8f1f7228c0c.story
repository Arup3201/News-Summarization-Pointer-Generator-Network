Spreading the word: Last week, Ms Nodiff-Netanel posted an photo of Valor with sheriff's deputies on Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses's Facebook page , alongside the caption: 'Congratulations Valor!

Trained specifically for therapy purposes, she will also be an 'integral part of reading programs and community outreach events' in the California city's Malibu area.

Valor, who was born on July 6, and her handler, Victoria Nodiff-Netanel, are part of Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses, a team of miniature horses that visit hospitals and hospice programs.

The nonprofit group comforts more than 35,000 adults and children each year who have experienced traumatic events, such as serious illnesses and crimes, according to NBC Washington.

The horses were even sent to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, after Adam Lanza, 20, stormed the building and fatally shot 20 children and six adults in December 2012.

In a press release, LASD spokesman, Heather Fuquay, said: 'Valor will serve as a 'face' of law enforcement and does so while upholding the Sheriff's Department motto of 'A Tradition of Service.'

Last week, Ms Nodiff-Netanel posted an photo of Valor with sheriff's deputies on  Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses's Facebook page, alongside the caption: 'Congratulations Valor!'

The post generated hundreds of positive comments, with one user, Lynda King, writing: 'Dear little Valor will have the opportunity to bring comfort to many hurting and frightened hearts.'

Meanwhile, Melissa Rafferty, from Helena, Montana, said: 'I just gotta say this news is amazing. I'm sitting her trying not to cry cause its an amazing duty for a mini horse. I'm excited for her.'

And Barbara Buford added: 'Cute mini horse. A Beautiful gesture, to do "GOOD"!'

Valor, who will be based at Malibu-Lost Hills Sheriff's Station, was named for Port Authority Police Officer Kenneth Tietjen, who died during the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
