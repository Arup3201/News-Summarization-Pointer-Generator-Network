For centuries France has held out against the dull language of 'les rosbifs' just across the Channel.

But now the country's future leaders have been told they must master English – a dramatic climbdown for a nation that has tried to ban words such as 'le weekend' from encroaching on its precious vocabulary.

ENA, the elite National School of Administration in Strasbourg, which produces the French governing class, is to make mastery of English a compulsory rule of entry from 2018.

Nathalie Loiseau, director of the elite National School of Administration in Strasbourg, which produces the French governing class, has said the school will make mastery of English a compulsory rule of entry from 2018

An ENA spokeswoman said fluency in English was essential to run a modern state, and that potential students had to be prepared. The move is in defiance of traditionalists including former French President Jacques Chirac, who in 2006 pledged to stop the spread of English internationally.

'We fight for our language,' said Mr Chirac, himself an ENA graduate, after walking out of a European Union summit when a French business chief spoke in English. 'I was profoundly shocked to see a Frenchman express himself in English,' said Mr Chirac. 'You cannot base a future world on just one language, just one culture. It would be a dramatic decline.'

Nathalie Loiseau, ENA's director, confirmed that the reform reflected a break with the past, saying French words are stuffy and outdated. 'The usual words such as 'sacrifice', 'vocation' and 'commitment' sound half religious, half military,' she said.
