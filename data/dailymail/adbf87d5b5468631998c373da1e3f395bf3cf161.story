From Burberry or Chanel to Giambattista Valli or Armani, most A-listers have a high-end designer on speed dial when it comes to dressing for a huge event.

And last night's Met Ball Gala was no different as a raft of celebrities dazzled in designer dresses as they descended on New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.

But amongst the usual red carpet suspects a certain British high-street brand made a huge fashion statement. Rubbing shoulders with the Givenchys and Oscar De La Rentas of this world was none other than Topshop - and it was revealed the High Street store dressed more A-listers than any other brand

Jaime King, Nicole Richie, Ashley Madekwe, Julianne Hough, Jourdan Dunn and Chloe Green all dazzled in custom designed outfits from the high street Mecca.

The glamorous girls posed as the most stylish coat hangers for five very different bespoke creations by Sir Philip Green's iconic retailer, made in association with American Vogue.

And the best news? You can snap one up for yourself because the beautiful creations will be going on sale by the end of the year.

The dresses will be available in the Los Angeles, New York and London stores as well as on Topshop.com, priced from around £300.

A Topshop spokesman said: 'Topshop were delighted to custom make dresses for such a great group of girls, bringing each one's individual style to the Punk theme.

'I think we dressed more guests than anyone else, and worked very closely with each one on how they wanted to look on the night.

'It is so exciting for the Topshop design team to see our guests looking incredible alongside others wearing more established "red-carpet" designers' looks.'

With actress Kate Bosworth on his books to help consult on a festival collection and Kate Moss as a close confident, Sir Philip Green is unstoppable - his latest fan just so happens to be a certain Duchess of Cambridge.

The entrepreneur proved his empire is ever-expanding by opening a store over the pond earlier this year.

'Since we opened in LA in February, red carpet has become even more important to us as a brand - and we are looking forward to creating limited edition runs of these looks to launch in Oxford Circus, LA and New York in early Autumn. Prices will start at £300,' added the spokesman.

Friends in high places: Sir Philip Green is close friends with Kate Moss and is collaborating with Kate Upson too

It's not the first time that the high-street giant has kitted out red carpet stars. King wowed in a bespoke red dress last year, while Ginnifer Goodwin has been dressed by Topshop too.

Sir Philip Green, who hosted the girls on his table said: 'The Topshop design team made me very proud - our girls all looked fabulous - really wow.'
