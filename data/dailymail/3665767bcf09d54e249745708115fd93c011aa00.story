He's set to join Manchester United for a staggering £75million and footballer Angel Di Maria says his good fortune is all thanks to his daughter, Mia.

The 16-month-old was born three months premature and was lucky to survive after complications with her birth. She was in intensive care for weeks and doctors feared she may not pull through.

It was a terrible time for Di Maria, 26, and his wife, Jorgelina Cardoso, 32. But to their relief, their little girl fought for her life and is now a happy, healthy child.

The Argentinian footballer said it is daughter's example that inspires him to always give his all on the pitch - leading him to become one of the game's top earners.

He told the Spanish paper Marca: 'My daughter's taught me that everything is possible. She taught me that the most difficult thing is at times the easiest, that the efforts of someone can be rewarded.

'She taught me how to suffer and be able to withstand pain and be stronger. Everything she transmitted to me helped me have a spectacular season.' 

Di Maria excelled in the past year playing for Real Madrid and then scored for his country in the World Cup, where they reached the final, before having to withdraw from the team effort due to injury.

It was enough to attract the attention of Manchester United bosses who are keen to sign the player to help their bid for Premiership and European glory.

Di Maria's decision to join the English club will be made with the full support of his wife, known as Jorgita, who he married in 2011.

She's never afraid to voice her opinions on social media, particularly if anyone criticises her beloved husband. 

As a proud mother, she regularly shares family photos on her Instagram account. 

After their daughter turned one in April, she also revealed how much Mia has enriched their lives, and how hard it was for them to see her suffering as a newborn.

She wrote: 'Two months in the Intensive Care Unit. No one but your father and I know the pain it caused to see your beautiful face covered in wires and devices. There was nothing sadder than going home with empty arms and breasts full of pain.

His biggest fan: Now 16-months-old, Mia is a happy and healthy little girl 

'Tears soaked our pillow every night, I had a constant knot in my throat.' 

She added that it was the happiest day of their lives when Mia was well enough to go home. And on her first birthday in April, she wrote of how far she had come.

'You're a very funny girl, healthy, strong, and a great fighter of this life, your life, our lives. You came into this world to teach us not to give up,' she said.

The couple remain eternally grateful to the Spanish hospital and staff who helped Mia survive.

Di Maria told The Sun that they made friends for live in the process as they bonded with other parents going through the same ordeal as them.

He explained: 'We spent more than two months at the hospital, always with the same parents. The pain unites people. It makes you stronger and we had a very relationship with all the parents there.'

He added that trying to carry on as normal and play football was difficult while Mia was in hospital.

'It was not easy but I had to fight,' he said.

Now that fight has paid off for him and his family as he's set to become Manchester United's new star - with his family cheering him on all the way.
