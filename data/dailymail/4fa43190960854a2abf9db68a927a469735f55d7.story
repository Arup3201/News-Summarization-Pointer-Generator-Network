Pakistani intelligence officials say a U.S. strike killed four alleged militants in the country’s northwestern tribal area in the town of Datta Khel today.

There were also reports from security officials that three people were killed in an attack in the Boya area of North Waziristan, a known Taliban and al-Qaida territory.

The Pakistani Government condemned the attack and argued that the drone strikes are counter-productive, cause unnecessary civilian casualties and breach human rights.

In a statement today they said: ‘These unilateral strikes are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 

‘Pakistan has repeatedly emphasised the importance of bringing an immediate end to drone strikes.’

The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a double suicide bomb attack in the city of Peshwar, killing 85 people in one of the deadliest attacks on the country's Christian minority earlier this month.

Breaching human rights: People protested against the U.S. drone attacks in the North Waziristran area of Pakistan where there has been a number of attacks in the last month

Rumoured: Unconfirmed reports that Mullah Sangeen Zadran, a senior leader in the network, was killed in a drone strike earlier this month

The Pakistani Taliban said it would 
continue to target non-Muslims until the US stopped drone attacks in the
country’s remote tribal region.

The North Waziristan region is dominated by fighters of the anti-American militant commander Hafiz Gul Bahadur and the Haqqani Network.

Both have been known to carry out attacks against NATO troops in neighbouring Afghanistan.    

The AFP reported that a drone attack which killed three was done by remotely piloted Predators or Reapers operated by CIA. Two missiles were fired at a compound. 

Earlier this month, four members of the Haqqani Network were killed in a US strike in the Darga Mandi village.

Unconfirmed reports said that Mullah Sangeen Zadran, a senior leader in the network, was among the dead.

The US has reduced the number of drone strikes in recent months.
