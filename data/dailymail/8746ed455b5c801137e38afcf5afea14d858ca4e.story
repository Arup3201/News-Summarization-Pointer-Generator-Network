A Bahraini anti-government protester was engulfed in flames when a shot fired by riot police hit the petrol bomb in his hand in Sanabis on Thursday.

Opposition leaders reported that 35 
protesters were injured, three critically, and the government said 
several police officers were hurt.

Protests and clashes erupted in opposition areas nationwide with government opponents blocking roads, closing shops and staying home from work and school.

Escalation of protests: A Bahraini anti-government demonstrator was set on fire when a shot fired by riot police hit the petrol bomb he was holding

The protests mark the second 
anniversary of a Saudi-Arabian led intervention that helped to crush a 
pro-democracy uprising in 2011.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates sent in 1,500 troops on March 14, 2011 to support the government against protesters.

Bahrain's Shi'ite majority, have 
continued small protests on an almost daily basis demanding equality and
a constitutional monarchy in the kingdom ruled by the Sunni al-Khalifa 
family.

The latest violence followed the 
death of two young men during clashes with police last month as 
Bahrainis marked the second anniversary of the February 14 start of the 
uprising.

It is likely to cast a shadow over reconciliation talks 
between the government and the opposition aimed at ending political 
turmoil.

The Islamist Wefaq association, the 
country's biggest opposition group, said that, by midday on Thursday, 
at least 10 people had been injured by security forces who they said 
used live bullets, birdshot and teargas against "peaceful 
demonstrators".

Three of those injured were in 
critical condition, the group said in a report on its website.

It posted
pictures of injuries, including a limb hit by what appeared to be a 
live round.

Heavy-handed: 35 protesters were said to be wounded, three critically, after the clashes yesterday with police

The Information Affairs Authority 
said several policemen were injured when demonstrators attacked them 
with petrol bombs and iron rods, and detonated homemade bombs 'endangering the lives of innocent bystanders and security personnel'.

'Police used restraint to restore 
order and all force used was necessary and proportionate,' the assistant
chief of security for operations said in the statement.

The statement said the demonstrators 
had stolen cars, torched vehicles and blocked the streets with large 
rocks and lampposts and scattered nails and oil on roads.

It attached 
pictures of barricaded roads and torched vehicles.

It was not immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the reports or pictures given by either side.

Unrest in the capital: Police fired tear gas at protesters as crowds took to the streets of Manama, the roads to which are mainly closed at the moment

An international inquiry commission, 
invited by Bahrain's government, said in a report in November 2011 that 
35 people had died during the uprising.

The dead were mainly protesters 
but included five security personnel and seven foreigners. The report 
said five people had died from torture. The opposition puts the death toll at more than 80.

Bahrain's opposition and government 
resumed reconciliation talks last month for the first time since July 
2011, but little progress has been reported in several sessions of 
negotiations.

It was unclear yesterday whether the man, protesting in the village of Sanabis, survived.
