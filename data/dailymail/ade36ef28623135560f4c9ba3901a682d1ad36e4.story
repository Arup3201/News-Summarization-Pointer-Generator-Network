Well one’s the king of the swingers – the other’s a bungle VIP.

But Prince Harry proved to be just as good a sport as Boris Johnson yesterday, joining children at a new play area on the site of the Olympic Park.

The fourth-in-line to the throne laughed and joked as he tried out one of the swings. He was joined by the Mayor of London – next to the site of the botched Olympic zipwire stunt which left him dangling above a bemused crowd back in 2012.

High-flying Prince: London's newest, biggest green space received the Royal seal of approval today as Prince Harry and the Mayor of London Boris Johnson joined local youngsters for a sneak preview of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park

Big kid at heart: Harry, dressed in a smart suit, wasn't afraid of getting stuck in as he made his way across a wobbly bridge at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park

The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 
Stratford, East London, opens today and will include an action-packed 
adventure playground and interactive water fountains. Harry claimed the 
attraction was ‘better than expected’, saying: ‘I think it’s absolutely 
amazing. I can’t wait to see it full of people.’

And
 the prince, 29, – who seemed to be following in his father and 
brother’s footsteps, sporting a thinning patch of hair – added: ‘People 
will be pouring through the place. The sun will be out. It will be the 
longest summer we’ve ever had, I’m sure.’

Prince Harry and Mr Johnson, both wearing navy suits, met outside the Aquatics Centre and began a walk around the park to meet local schoolchildren at the riverside play area and speak to the teams involved in transforming the area in the last 18 months. 

Harry chatted with schoolchildren and even pushed them on a swing while Boris watched from the sidelines. Perhaps he was afraid of making a fool of himself again after appearing on a zip wire above Victoria
 Park last year - the stunt did not exactly go to plan as the London Mayor
 was at one point left dangling helplessly above a bemused crowd.

The development has been led by the London Legacy Development Corporation.

When Harry was asked if Prince George would visit the park in future years, he replied: 'I'm sure he'll have his chance to come down here.

'You never know, the Olympics might be back here again before we know it.'

On hearing that remark, Mr Johnson joked: 'We'll put in for the Winter Games!'

'Come on, Boris, give us a hand!' The Mayor leaves the fun to Prince Harry who plays on a swing with children at the new park

'I'll leave it to you, Harry' Boris cheers from the sidelines as Harry gets pushed in a giant swing by the excitable children

Having a laugh: The prince and Mr Johnson, both wearing navy suits, met outside the Aquatics Centre and began a walk around the park to meet local schoolchildren

Cautious: After Boris' zip wire incident last year, he nervously approaches the wobbly bridge

Hurry up, Boris! The schoolchildren wait patiently as a nervous Boris makes his way across the rope bridge

Concentration: Boris stares insistently at the finish line as he makes his way across the rope bridge. The ordeal was obviously too much and he suffered a wardrobe malfunction (right) 

Mr Johnson went on: 'It's far more 
beautiful than I possibly thought it could be. This is going to be a 
quite astonishing place to come and bring your family.'

He added: 'We've got to be careful, some cities have had pretty bad experiences.

'But
 I think London is doing absolutely brilliantly and there's no question 
that I think most experts on Olympic legacy would say this was the best 
that any Olympic city has been able to do in such a short time.'

The
 Prince and Mr Johnson met representatives from the Invictus Games, a 
Paralympic-style championship for injured servicemen and women.Some of the events will take place in the park in September.

The pair were then taken on a ride on mobility cycles with participants of Bikeworks, which helps people with disabilities.

Harry
 rode on a bike with Terry Sullivan, 29, from the Isle of Dogs, east 
London, who steered them perilously close to a water fountain. He said afterwards: 'I loved it. I wanted to go into the water!'

Dennis
 Hone, chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation, 
which manages the regeneration of the park, said the visit was a 
success.

'I think they 
stress-tested everything that we've got on the south plaza ready for its
 opening tomorrow,' he said. They gave it a thorough test and they 
seemed to enjoy it."

The 
376ft (114.5m) high ArcelorMittal Orbit lies at the centre of the new 
park and there will be future ventures with the Victoria and Albert 
Museum and University College London.

Visitors will also be able to view the interactive water fountains and an action-packed adventure playground.

'This
 is now a must-see destination for Londoners and visitors alike and 
forms a glittering centrepiece for our ambitious regeneration plans in 
Stratford and beyond.'
