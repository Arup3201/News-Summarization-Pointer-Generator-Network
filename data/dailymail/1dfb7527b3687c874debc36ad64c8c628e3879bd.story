The 21-year-old, who left the Premier League club by mutual consent a fortnight ago, was arrested after police received reports of a fight between a couple at around 7pm on Wednesday evening.

The London-born former England under-19 player was taken into custody after the alleged assault in the car park of The Gate entertainment complex.

Troubled: Nile Ranger leaves Newcastle Magistrates Court today after admitting assaulting his girlfriend

He appeared at Newcastle Magistrates Court today and pleaded guilty to a charge of common assault.

The striker left Newcastle United after 62 appearances, including only five league starts and just three goals.

He also spent time on loan at Sheffield Wednesday and Barnsley.

Guilty: Nile Ranger had a troubled career at Newcastle United before his contract was terminated by mutual consent

Ranger had a troubled time with club after joining in 2008 with manager Alan Pardew frequently expressing his frustration with his constant lateness for training.

At the end of last year he was given the ultimatum to turn up on time for six weeks before he would be allowed to train with the first team

Having made it back into the squad, he was arrested in January on suspicion of rape and bailed until next month.

He drew ire from some Newcastle fans after posting a picture on Instagram, spelling out his name in Â£20 notes.
