The future of travel booking is here.

TripAdvisor has just launched their brand new personalised hotel recommendation feature - Just for You - that will offer up customised hotel offerings based on individual preferences from previous research on the site.

All in a day's work for the world's largest travel site, which calls this new service 'a natural extension.'

TripAdvisor has rolled out a brand new feature - Just for You - to give travellers personalised recommendations

Senior Vice-President, Global Product, Adam Medros said: 'By virtue of the insights and attributes that we've gathered from millions of traveller reviews and opinions, TripAdvisor is uniquely able to match travellers with their ideal hotels.

'The new Just for You feature is the evolution of the hotel search on TripAdvisor and a natural extension of our ongoing efforts to make every travel-planning experience more helpful and personally relevant for our users.' 

Here's how it works. When holidaymakers search hotels for a particular destination, they'll be presented with a variety of tags allowing them to select travel preferences - location, price range, hotel class, etc.

Through the new feature, TripAdvisor will take this feedback into account - along with prior research that the individual has done on the site - to create personalised results to help travellers find their perfect hotel.   

The customised hotel offerings will be based on individual preferences from previous research on the site

The  feature will grow and improve as travellers select more preference tags and write more hotel reviews

Currently, the Just for You app is available on all desktop sites and on the mobile website on tablet.

The feature will continue to adapt and improve as individuals  select more preference tags, write more hotel reviews, and search for special destinations on TripAdvisor.

'Just for You is highly adaptive and learns from your favourite hotels and destinations,' Medros says. 

'With the new feature, we can not only match a traveller with their preferred type of hotel, but we can suggest the trendy, boutique hotel located downtown with a swimming pool because we know those are the specific hotel characteristics you like.'
