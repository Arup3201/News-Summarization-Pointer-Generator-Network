Alan Pardew has revealed the pressure he is under at Newcastle after describing supporter unrest and calls for him to be sacked as ‘mass hysteria’.

The 53-year-old is bracing himself for a poisonous atmosphere inside St James’ Park when they take on Hull City on Saturday.

 ‘This situation at the moment is almost like mass hysteria, to a degree,’ he said.

Pardew said Mike Ashley had every right to be disappointed with Newcastle's results as the club's owner

‘It's really gone to a level which makes it really difficult for players to perform in. The environment for the players will probably be as tough as it’s ever been and we have to accept that. I am hoping we can turn that around. I don't expect the start to be easy.’

He added: ‘I think I am the best person for the job – but I don't think our fans agree with that.

‘It has been suggested that I don’t care about this position, and that I’ve got this long contract and that I’m going through the motions – nothing could be further from the truth. I was absolutely sick after the game on Saturday. I have been hurt this week.’  

Sportsmail can reveal that United loanee Hatem Ben Arfa – a fan favourite on Tyneside - WILL be in the visiting dugout, although he is not eligible to play.

And Pardew expects to face a difficult afternoon against Hull when supporters are expected to demand his four-year tenure be brought to an end.

Pardew met Ashley on Sunday and Sportsmail understands that, while no specific assurances were given over his future, he will be given time to improve results.

‘We didn’t have a conversation regarding my position,’ revealed Pardew.

‘He was upset with the performance and I think he has every right to be that as an owner. I told him some things which I think should be sorted out and some things that can help me.

‘At the end of the day, Mike and myself do not want Newcastle to lose. We want to have the best possible team and we want to win. Now at the moment, of course, we haven’t got that.’

Pardew – who comes up against David Meyler for the first time since headbutting the Hull midfielder in March – has also defended right-hand man Carver following the confrontation with fans at St Mary’s.

‘I hate the fact John got involved in that incident before the game, because he has got black and white blood. Nobody loves this club more than him,’ he said.

‘He’s had more roles at this club more than anyone else probably – academy director, youth team coach, first team coach to Bobby Robson and to me in different eras. That all hurts.

‘Do you think before a game he wants to see the banners going up and negativity towards the team? Of course not. He tried to defend that and has apologised for being slightly aggressive, but that’s all it was.’

Meanwhile, Pardew has paid tribute to Gutierrez who this week revealed he is currently undergoing chemotherapy in Argentina.

‘As a player, the best left side I have had at this club was (Jose) Enrique and Jonas, there is no doubt about that - that was a terrific pairing. When we finished fifth, Jonas was a massive part of that,’ he said.

Jonas Guiterrez revealed this week that he is suffering from testicular cancer and is receiving treatment

Alan Pardew was full of praise for Jonas Gutierrez who was 'popular not just on the pitch but also off it'

‘Now he finds himself in a different fight and a different situation. I have to admire the way he has conducted himself. We honoured his decision to keep it quiet until such time he felt comfortable. I am sure people will use this as an example of hopefully how to deal with it.

‘He has been incredibly brave to go on TV and give interviews. Someone will be diagnosed with it in the North East today and it is that common. All our love goes to him and we just send our best wishes.

‘I have not spoken to the squad yet (about it) but I intend to on Friday or Saturday.

‘He was popular not just on the pitch but also off it with his stupid singing and dancing and naked antics up and down the corridor. He is much missed. We send our love.’
