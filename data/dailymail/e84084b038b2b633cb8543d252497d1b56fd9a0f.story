Jenson Button concedes his years of experience have taught him to be 'massively relaxed' about his Formula One future.

Ahead of this weekend's Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Button is currently in limbo as he waits for McLaren's top brass to make a decision on the team's driver line-up for next season.

Out of contract in a few months' time, Button faces the prospect of his 15-year run in the sport coming to an end.

Rumours of McLaren attempting to poach Fernando Alonso or Sebastian Vettel, despite both being tied to their respective contracts with Ferrari and Red Bull, have been rife of late.

Button, however, takes it all in his stride as he said: 'I've been racing in F1 for 15 years. You go through a lot in your career, you hear a lot of b*******.

'Initially it's annoying, but then you're like 'you know what, I've been here before, been in this situation before, heard it before'.

'So you just get on with your job, and I love racing in Formula One.

'Every time I jump in a car I do the best job I can - and it doesn't matter who it's for or where it is - I do the best for myself, the team and the fans.

'That's not going to change because you never do a half-hearted job, you always do the best you can, you want to beat your team-mate and you want to beat every single guy out there.

'Nothing changes, just the length of time you have available to fulfil your dreams.

'So I'm massively relaxed. I'm always relaxed.'

Thinking it over: Despite being contracted to Ferrari, Fernando Alonso has been linked with a shock return to McLaren where he he left under a cloud following a turbulent 2007 season

In a recent interview Button remarked if he had 'to retire at the end of the year, then so be it'.

It is the first time he has mentioned the word 'retirement', although claims there was a reason on this occasion.

'When you're asked the question (about his future) so many times you've got to say something different else it gets boring,' said Button.

'Not for you guys, but for me it gets boring. I'm so bored of answering the same questions.

'I said if I wasn't racing at the end of the season, so be it. That's what I said.

'If I'm not racing, so be it. I can't do much about that, but it's not that I'm getting ready because I definitely don't want to retire for many years.'

With regard to McLaren's overtures towards Alonso, Button is far from concerned given the Spaniard is contracted to Ferrari through to the end of 2016.

McLaren Group CEO Ron Dennis recently stated he is a man who respects contracts, and with Alonso saying he is keen to remain at the Maranello marque, the rumours appear groundless.

Button added: 'That doesn't change my cause at all. It doesn't change anything because he was always staying at Ferrari.'
