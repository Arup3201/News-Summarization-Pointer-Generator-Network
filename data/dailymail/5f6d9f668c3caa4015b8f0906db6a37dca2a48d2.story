A 23-year-old woman who was viciously attacked by her boyfriend released shocking photographs last night of her beaten body in an effort to help other victims of domestic violence.

Litisha Henry was left with a severely swollen face, chipped teeth, clumps of her hair missing and cuts, bruises and scratches over her body after the attack by Franklin White, 44, in Rochester, Kent.

After he was sentenced to six years in prison last Friday for the assault, Miss Henry decided to come forward to encourage other domestic violence victims to have the courage to seek justice.

The attack began at 2.20am on March 17 after the couple had argued following a night out together, before White launched a ferocious attack on his victim, punching her and dragging her by her hair.

Miss Henry begged him to stop and witnesses who tried to intervene were threatened with violence.

She said: 'I was on the floor - I begged him to stop and he just laughed. I was confused, I didn't really know what was going on. At one point I thought he was going to kill me because he wouldn't stop.'

White then forced his victim into a black BMW and attempted to drive back to his home. But police officers spotted the vehicle being driven erratically and arrested him in Gillingham after a pursuit.

Miss Henry added: 'I knew that if he'd got me into his house, things would just get worse. If he could do that in a high street, what he could do behind closed doors I don't even want to think about.'

Concern: Fearing reprisals if she spoke out, she was initially too scared to tell police what had happened

Kent Police Detective Constable Jason Lynch said: ‘It was clear when our officers looked into the vehicle that Litisha was seriously injured and terrified and it was necessary to use force to remove White from the vehicle.

'He just laughed. At one point I thought he was going to kill me because he just wouldn’t stop'

‘Litisha’s injuries were the result of a sustained and brutal assault, but her injuries could have been a lot worse had we not been alerted so quickly by members of the public.’

Fearing reprisals if she spoke out, she was initially too scared to tell police what had happened. But Miss Henry was encouraged to make statements and give testimony in court by officers who specialise in domestic violence cases.

Miss Henry added: 'When it happened I found out he'd done it to a few people before and obviously they'd never come forward to the police.

'So I'm just happy that he knows now that he can't get away with doing what he did, because no-one's ever come forward before. So I'm doing this just to show people that they can get what they deserve.'

DC Lynch added: ‘This was a cowardly attack which left the victim with very serious injuries and in fear for her life.

‘Thankfully Litisha has been brave enough to testify in court to ensure that White’s actions did not go unpunished.

'Domestic violence doesn’t just take place behind closed doors and we would urge anyone suffering domestic abuse to contact us.

‘We take every call seriously and officers will provide support to victims while they investigate reports of domestic abuse.’

White was sentenced at Maidstone Crown Court after being convicted of intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

He was also jailed concurrently for one month for failing to provide a breath specimen and for three months for a previous assault, for which he had been serving a suspended sentence.
