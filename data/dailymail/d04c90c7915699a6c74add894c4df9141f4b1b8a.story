This is the horrifying moment a Brazilian prison warden was tied up and dangled from the jail roof by inmates who have seized control of the complex.

The uprising at the Guarapuava prison in the south of the country began on Monday when inmates on a work detail over-powered guards, taking 12 of them hostage on the building's roof.

Authorities trying to gain control of the prison uprising managed to win the release of one of 12 prison guards yesterday, but the others have been stripped naked, tied up and badly beaten by masked prisoners gathered on the rooftop, in scenes that have shocked Brazil.

Violence: Live television images broadcast on Monday showed prisoners armed with knives and clubs beating some of the disrobed guards and fellow inmates atop a prison building roof

The Parana state justice secretariat said a group of more than 30 prisoners was leading the rebellion at the Guarapuava prison, and that an unknown number of other inmates were involved.

There are about 250 inmates in total at the facility some 550 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro.

The inmates have a long list of demands, including better food, treatment, conditions and the transfer of some prisoners to other penitentiaries.

It's the latest rebellion to hit a prison in Brazil, where severe overcrowding and poor infrastructure lead to dozens of uprisings each year.

Horrific conditions and inter-gang violence are seen in many of Brazil's prison facilities, some of which are essentially run by drug gang leaders who continue to run their criminal enterprises on the outside despite being locked up.

In one sickening incident in August, prisoners beheaded two fellow inmates during a rebellion at another facility in Parana state.

Live television images broadcast on Monday showed prisoners armed with knives and clubs beating some of the disrobed guards and fellow inmates atop a prison building roof. 

At least six men were injured when they were thrown from the roof onto the ground below.

No deaths have been reported in the latest disturbances at Guarapuava prison.
