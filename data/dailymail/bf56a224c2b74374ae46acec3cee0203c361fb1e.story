A former maths graduate has invented a chocolate bar with so few calories it could help you lose weight.

Entrepreneurial chocoholic Aneesh Popat has created what he calls ‘water ganache’ which allows him to make chocolate bars with as little as 20 calories.

The water ganache is made without butter, cream, gelatine or eggs to create a ‘pure’ chocolate that won’t stay on your hips.

No shock choc: Aneesh Popat, known as The Chocolatier has created a chocolate which will only set you back 20 calories per bar

By combining flavour-infused water with high-quality cocoa Aneehsh’s water ganache comes in a range of flavours, from the more exotic chai tea and pineapple and cardamom to classic salted caramel and mint truffles.

After launching his own sweet-making business The Chocolatier two years ago, the 25 year old Londoner has been taking the confectionary world by storm.

Aneesh is now aiming to introduce his creations to some of the finest restaurants before opening his first shop in London's St Pancras station.

Aneesh said: ‘Ever since I was a youngster being around chocolate has always been my passion. If everything in the world was made of chocolate then I'd have eaten it by now.

‘My love of chocolate led me to devote 
and apply my mathematical and scientific backgrounds to create the most 
unique flavour combinations with utmost precision and creativity.'

Aneesh is self-taught but says he has taken inspiration from many famous chocolatiers and chefs and has travelled 'from Brugges to Mumbai' in his search for the perfect flavours.

‘Chocolate is good for you if made in the right way. I believe in using quality ingredients, and I place great importance on creating chocolate that is exciting, experimental and thought provoking, all too en-heighten taste and indulgence.’

Nutritional expert Dr Sarah Schenker believes that overweight people may find help in the low-calorie chocolates - so long as the balance is right.

Dr Schenker, of the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘As these chocolates boast such a low calorie level and high water content it can be advantageous to people seeking a less naughty treat - rather than sausage rolls or typical chocolates.

‘They can be encouraging for people to switch to as snacks but it has to be done with caution - after all we mustn't forget that chocolate is an occasional treat to enjoy.'

Success: Aneesh launched The Chocolatier two years ago and has been hailed by chefs around the world since and now supplies Michelin star restaurants

She added: 'Certainly the benefits could indeed help people to lose weight as they would find it easier to stay away from naughty snacks.’

Aneesh is now pushing to introduce his chocolate to the open market - finding great success at national food exhibitions.

The confectionaries are already being supplied to Michelin star restaurants and five star hotels in London and Aneesh is also hoping to launch his first shop this autumn.

Aneesh said: ‘The response from people has been astonishing. After taking the initial recipe and creating the first batch I knew it could potentially transform my life.

‘I would never have thought I'd be where I am today - and that's still not very far. The next process is to open a shop and begin working relationships with restaurants.

‘It's an incredible feeling to know people enjoy what you've made - many people struggle with their weight but I guess I'm here to save the day and their figures.’
