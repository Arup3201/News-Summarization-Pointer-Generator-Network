Twelve thousand striking miners in South Africa have been sacked by the world's largest producer of platinum in an ongoing dispute over wages.

More than 28,000 workers took part in three weeks of wildcat strikes in Rustenburg, during which police shot dead 34 protesters.

Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) said the illegal industrial action had cost them 700million rand - or Â£51million - in revenue with a reduced output of 39,000 ounces.

Both miners and officials have been killed during the wave of wildcat strikes to hit the mining industry in South Africa, with 34 platinum miners being shot dead by police during one incident in August.

Amplats said their miners were dismissed because they failed to attend disciplinary hearings, the BBC reported.

The company also said four of its mining operations in Rustenburg were unable to operate fully because of attendance levels of less than 20 per cent.

The company said workers would have three days to appeal the outcome of their disciplinary hearings, which were due to take place today, Friday.

According to the BBC, a spokesman for Amplats said: 'Approximately 12,000 striking 
employees chose not to make representations, nor attend the hearings, 
and have therefore been dismissed in their absence.'

A commission of inquiry into the deaths at the Marikana platinum mine - where 34 were shot dead - began this week.

The Marikana strikers have since been given pay rises far higher than the rate of inflation and the workers have returned to the mine.

South African prosecutors sparked outrage last month after charging 270 miners with the murders of 34 of their striking colleagues who were shot dead by police.

The mass killing of the strikers at the Marikana mine in August was one of the most shocking incidents since the end of white rule in 1994.

The arrested miners were charged under a law dating from the apartheid era that alleges they had a 'common purpose' in the murder of their co-workers.

The African National Congress, whose members used to be gunned down by apartheid police at protest rallies and targeted with draconian laws, has been severely criticised for using similar tactics now that it is in power.

President Jacob Zuma has seen his support erode, with his enemies saying he is more interested in getting close to industry and powerful labour groups than miners working deep underground.

At the centre of violence: The Lonmin PLC mine, near Rustenburg, 100km north-west of Johannesburg, where around 3,000 miners walked out on August 10 over wages. Since then there have been several fatal incidents

Prosecutors charged the 270 miners, already under arrest on suspicion 
of murder in a earlier shooting at the mine, with the August 16 murder 
of 34 co-workers at Marikana, the world's third biggest 
platinum producer, Lonmin.

The
34 were shot in a hail of police bullets in what has been dubbed the 
'Marikana Massacre' with videos of the killings broadcast worldwide. 
Police will not be subject to punishment until the conclusion of a 
government probe early next year.

Common
purpose was often used by the apartheid government against black citizens to 
sentence numerous people for crimes committed by only a few.

Mosiuoa
Lekota, a former ANC cabinet minister and now leader of the COPE 
opposition party, was imprisoned during apartheid in a case where the 
common purpose doctrine was invoked. He said the decision to charge the miners was a setback for democracy.

Zuma
is facing re-election as the ANC's leader in December and poor 
management of the shooting would strengthen his opponents who see him as
running an ineffectual government.

He has ordered an investigation into 
the responsibility of police, Lonmin and the feuding unions that caused 
the strike at Marikana. The panel's report is due a month after the ANC 
vote.

Zuma has made little 
progress on his main policies since taking office in 2009, with 
unemployment increasing, corruption perceived to be getting worse and 
the gap between rich and poor - already among the worst in the world - 
growing wider.

Many 
striking miners have avoided pointing fingers at Zuma so far, preferring
to criticise Lonmin and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) for not
doing enough to help them.

'I blame the management of the 
company. They are the ones who called out the police. NUM is too busy 
with politics to help us,' said Lazarus Letsoele, a striking miner.
