Kids in the U.S. have been getting fatter since the turn of the century.

Childhood obesity rates have 
increased over the past 14 years, according to a new study published on this week.

The new findings conflict directly with officialÂ government health 
researchers who claimed less than two months ago there had been a sharp drop in preschool obesity rates over the 
past decade.

Gaining: Childhood obesity is on the rise in the U.S. after all, according to a new report after a 14 year study

The 'good 
news', announced in February by researchers at the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), received widespread media coverage
 and prompted first lady Michelle Obama to say she was 'thrilled at the 
progress that had been made over the last few years.

However, the new study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, used
 the same data source as the CDC, but analyzed obesity rates over a 
different timeframe.

It found increases in obesity for children age 2 to
 19, and a marked rise in the percentage who were severely obese.

Asheley
 Cockrell Skinner of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
who led the new study, said the main message of her analysis is that 
childhood obesity rates have not improved.

'I
 don't want a study like the previous one to change the national 
discourse,' she told Reuters Health, referring to the CDC's work.

Obesity
 experts had already begun to question the large drop reported by the 
CDC for children ages 2 to 5. In their February paper the CDC scientists
 themselves acknowledged the statistical limitations of their data.

CDC
 researcher Cynthia Ogden, who led the study released in February, said 
in response that her report described trends over the last 10 years and 
found 'an apparent decline in obesity among children ages 2-5 (which we 
said in the paper should be interpreted cautiously).'

'We're confident in our analysis for this time period,' she wrote in an email to Reuters Health on Monday,

Data: The analysis is based on 14 years of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 26,690 children aged 2 to 19

The
 February report from the CDC found that the rate of obesity among 
children ages 2 to 5 fell to 8.4 percent in 2011-2012 from 13.9 percent 
in 2003-2004.

Skinner and 
her colleagues used the same data as the CDC researchers, from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, but looked at a few 
additional years.

'In 2003
 there was an unusual spike in the number for whatever reason - probably
 an error,' Skinner said. 'When you take a long view from 1999 to now, 
you don't see that decline.'

About 27,000 U.S. children between the ages of 2 and 19 were included in the survey between 1999 and 2012.

Children
 are considered obese when their body mass index, a measure of weight in
 relation to height, exceeds that of 95 percent of their peers of the 
same age and sex.

Expanding waistline: Though the analysis indicates the prevalence of all forms of obesity have increased overall, the rate increases were most significant among Hispanic females and black males.

Overall,
 obesity rates increased from 14.5 percent in the 1999-2000 survey to 
17.3 percent in 2011-2012. There was also a marked increase in the rate 
of severe obesity over the study period, the researchers found. Among 
preschoolers age 2 to 5, the rate was slightly lower, but that could 
have been due to chance.

'Even
 though we don't see huge increases in the rates of children who are 
overweight or obese, there are clearly more in the categories that are 
severely obese,' Skinner said.

There
 were especially noticeable increases in the rates of severe obesity 
among black boys, Hispanic girls and white girls, Skinner said.

Rates for all obesity categories remained relatively unchanged between the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 surveys.

Skinner
 said there is some evidence that intensive weight loss can be 
beneficial for overweight and obese children, but intensive weight loss 
programs are not widely available.

Referring
 to the CDC's conclusion that obesity among preschoolers had fallen 43 
percent, Dr Ihuoma Eneli, medical director for the Center for Healthy 
Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, 
Ohio, said, 'we definitely have to look to see what the results are over
 the next few years to see if that 43 percent drop is sustained and a 
true decline.'
