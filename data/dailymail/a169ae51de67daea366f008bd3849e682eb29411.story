An invasion of aggressive mosquito could spell disaster as they threaten to end the great Australian outdoor barbecue.

The exotic Asian tiger mosquito is capable of spreading dengue fever to southern capital cities including Sydney and Brisbane.

While it's impossible to say exactly when we can expect to see the pest make Australia home, scientists are certain they will arrive here.

'It's definitely only a matter of time,' QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute associate professor Greg Devine told AAP.

Asian tiger mosquito: The large and aggressive pest is set to invade Australia according to scientists

The species can carry diseases including dengue, yellow fever, Ross River and chikungunya virus and because they thrive in and around homes, could put Australia's outdoor lifestyle at risk

'It arrived in the Torres Strait about 2005, but of course that's not the only route at which it can come in.

'There is no doubt it is coming eventually because it's been picked up so many times at Australia's borders.'

But in a bid to stay ahead of the pests, Queensland scientists are breeding the highly invasive species, which is able to bite dozens of times a minute.

The scientists are studying the only colony of the mosquito in Australia, wisely kept behind locked doors in the Brisbane medical research institute.

Associate prof Devine said the research is critical because the Asian tiger mosquitoes can introduce the debilitating chikungunya virus and spread diseases such as dengue.

'What we'd like to understand is the real risk of transmission in urban centres like Brisbane and Sydney,' he said.

'We are also looking at the way it would interact with native mosquitoes so we can determine how rapid its impact will be.'

Most concerning however, is the risk the pest posed to the outdoor lifestyle enjoyed by so many Australians, because the mosquitos flourish in and around homes and are capable on biting all day.

'It's come to be known as the barbecue stopper, and for good reason,' associate prof Devine said.

But the large pest can also spread diseases such as yellow fever, Ross River virus and chikungunya.

Common in southeast Asia, there is currently no treatment for the chikungunya virus, which can leave those bitten with severe joint pain for months.
