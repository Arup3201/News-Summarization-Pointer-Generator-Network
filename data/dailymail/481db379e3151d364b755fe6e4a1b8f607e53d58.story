Owner Michael Owen has set his sights on a clash with the Queen’s defending champion Estimate in next month’s Ascot Gold Cup after his Brown Panther landed the Ormonde Stakes at Chester.

The six-year-old fended off Hillstar by two and a quarter lengths under a positive ride from Richard Kingscote.

Owen said: ‘We didn’t want a dawdle because he has stamina. We mapped out the Ascot Gold Cup as his early season target and had a number of options for his first run.’

Brown Panther, winner of the 2013 Goodwood Cup, was running for the first time since finishing eighth to Fiorente in November’s Melbourne Cup and Owen did not rule out another trip Down Under later in the year.

Winning trainer Tom Dascombe, enjoying his first winner of the May meeting at his local track, said Brown Panther was getting easier to train as he got older and believes he will stay the two and a half miles of the Gold Cup, centrepiece of Ladies’ Day at the royal meeting.

Dascombe added: ‘He is more settled and not wearing his heart on his sleeve as much. He clearly stays and is related to three-mile hurdle winners.’

Brown Panther is 8-1 for the Royal Ascot race in a market headed by Aidan O’Brien’s 2013 St Leger winner Leading Light.

O’Brien, successful with Orchestra in 
Thursday’s Chester Vase, landed another Derby trial win with Kingfisher,
 ridden by son Joseph, in the Dee Stakes.

The Irish trainer, whose 2,000 Guineas third Australia heads the Epsom betting at 11-8, runs both Blue Hussar and Mekong River in Saturday's Lingfield Derby Trial but has a more serious Derby contender in unbeaten Geoffrey Chaucer in Sunday's Derrinstown Stud Trial at Leopardstown.

Geoffrey Chaucer only needed hands and heels riding when winning the Group Two Beresford Stakes at the Curragha last season.

Joseph said: ‘He did not learn much from his debut and Beresford was all about educating him. He is ready to start back.’

O’Brien runs Giovanni Boldini (Ryan Moore) in Sunday’s French 2,000 Guineas at Longchamp and Wonderfully in the French 1,000.

A strong British challenge for the Classics also see Marco Botti run Lat Hawilll (2,000) and Al Thakhira (1,000).

Brian Meehan saddle J Wonder in the 1,000 alongside Rae Guest’s Cape Factor and Charlie Hills-trained Queen Catrine.

Andrew Balding runs End of Line in the 2,000 and John Gosden saddles Muwaary.
