A driver was stunned to spot a sheep being driven around London in the back of a Volvo.

John Bowden was on his way home when he saw the animal staring back at him through the back window of the car in front.

The 44-year-old said he couldn't believe his eyes when he noticed the unusual passenger as he pulled up to traffic lights on the South Circular Road near Tulse Hill station, south London.  

Baaad driver: John Bowden was stunned to see a sheep staring at him from the back of a Volvo in London

Mr Bowden told The Mirror: 'We had just pulled up at the cross roads and I thought, hold on that's a sheep in the back of a Volvo.

'My wife said 'I've seen it all now'.'

He added the black Volvo was being driven by an 'old bloke' - who had also plastered a sticker proclaiming 'I love sheep' to the back of his vehicle.

'He had a white hair and white moustache - he was all in white like the sheep,' he added. 

Mr Bowden, who is a street ambassador for the Heart of London Business Alliance, said the picture has garnered a huge amount of attention from his friends after he uploaded it to Facebook.
