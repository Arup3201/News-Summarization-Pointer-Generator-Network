Clive Palmer has stormed out of an interview with the ABC's 7.30 program, yanking out his earpiece and refusing to answer further questions from host Sarah Ferguson.

Palmer appeared via videolink from Queenstown, New Zealand, but when asked about an ongoing legal battle with Chines company Citic Pacific, which is hinged on the financials of an iron ore project in WA, he refused to continue the interview.

'Don't talk to me about allegations and b******t,' the Palmer United Party leader said.

Mr Palmer was unfazed by earlier questions about his party's last-minute tactics in the upper house denying the government a day of celebration. But after flying out of Canberra for a holiday, Mr Palmer would not be denied his day.

The mining magnate refused to be drawn on the court battle, saying there were no proceedings against him personally.

'I'm not answering any more, so goodbye ... see you later,' he said, snatching off his earpiece and walking out of the New Zealand studio.

Earlier on Thursday the Abbott government's carbon tax repeal bills were defeated in the Senate, after Clive Palmer threw a last-minute curve-ball by voting against abolishing the carbon tax.

The final vote count was 37 opposing the repeal and 35 supporting, meaning the government will now have to wait at least another week before it gets to pass its flagship reform.

Mr Palmer's decided to dump his support for abolishing the carbon tax after amendments he demanded, which would have seen all savings from abolishing the bill be handed back to consumers, were not included.

After the farcical vote, the Abbott government announced they would support Mr Palmer's.

Clive Palmer has thrown a last-minute curve-ball at the Abbott government by announcing his senators will delay a Senate vote on the carbon tax

'There are no circumstances that we'd be voting today for the carbon tax repeal.'

The abolishment of the carbon tax was one of the key policy planks of Tony Abbott when he was elected to government last year.

One of the key changes is a penalty imposed on entities that do not pass on savings to gas and electricity customers.

The penalty would be 250 per cent of the saving that has not been passed on.

It also removes reference to 'domestic' electricity and gas customers, potentially leaving it open for companies to be penalised if they don't pass on savings to overseas customers.

The definition of 'entity', which replaces 'corporation', is expanded to include individuals and 'any party or entity which can or does buy or sell electricity or gas'.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised an immediate drop in power prices should the Senate scrap the carbon tax as expected prior to Mr Palmer's decision

The time in which entities have to give the consumer watchdog a notice they are complying with price cuts has been set at 30 days after the bill gains royal assent.

Entities face a $34,000 fine if they don't comply - double the original fine.

Mr Palmer said the amendments were lodged with the Senate Clerk's office at 8.30am.

'We asked that it be distributed and we had a violent action from government, a violent reaction I would say,' Mr Palmer said.

'We had ministers calling us and visiting our senators and complaining.'

Mr Palmer defended his party's move, arguing the changes ensure savings would be passed onto consumers.

Mr Palmer claimed he had been on the receiving end of 'nasty conversations' with the government and other people.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised an immediate drop in power prices should the Senate scrap the carbon tax as expected prior to Mr Palmer's decision.

The carbon tax was a nine per cent impost on power bills, a $9 billion 'handbrake' on the economy, and a $550 annual hit for households, according to the PM.

Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett says Clive Palmer is a great blimp

Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett says Clive Palmer is a great blimp that occasionally farts, causing damage to the country.

He gave the unflattering assessment of Mr Palmer on Fairfax Radio when he asked to comment on the development that the Palmer United Party wouldn't vote on Thursday to repeal the carbon tax.

'He reminds me of a great blimp flying around this world of ours, this country of ours, and every now and then it lets off steam, or, to use a Clive Palmer expression, he just farts,' Mr Kennett said.

'That's all he does, he floats around, he causes trouble, there is no logic to what he is doing and it can be so damaging to this country.'

Palmer has previously likened Australia's carbon tax to a 'fart tax' in place in New Zealand to curb methane gas emissions from the farming sector.
