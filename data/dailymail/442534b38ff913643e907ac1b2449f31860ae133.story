After the scrabble to find little gold nuggets buried in Folkestone beach, treasure hunters now have a more sedate way to get rich.

The Endgame is a trilogy of adventure stories by James Frey, whose previous works include The Lorien Legacies and I Am Number Four.

Readers who can solver a series of codes, puzzles and riddles in the books will win prizes totalling $3m (£1.8m).

This is now but that was then: Endgame is being published in October while another 'clue book' Masquerade appeared in 1979

The first book, Endgame: The Calling, contains clues that will lead the first person to solve them to $500,000 (£300,000) in gold coins.

The second book could make one reader a millionaire and the final book the prize fund rises to $1.5m.

Publishing rights have been sold to 27 countries and Mr Frey is working on the first of three films to coincide with the books, which are published by HarperCollins.

The idea for a book with a related prize is not new. In 1979, Kit Williams created a treasure hunt with his book Masquerade. He buried an 18-carat gold and jewel-encrusted hare in a secret location (a Bedfordshire park) and left clues in the book.

‘It was amazing that he could build something as complex... in something so short. I was obsessed with it,” Mr Frey said. “Ours is constructed in radically different ways. It’s much more complex and more difficult.”

The story follows the main characters around the world to countries including the UK, Australia and China and readers have to figure out the puzzle as they go.

Mr Frey has revealed that the clues include words, maths, images and connections within the story.

The first Endgame book will be published on October 7 and will also utilise the internet and social media
