Hell hath no fury: Faye Hill sposted a flaming card through her boyfriend's letterbox after a row, causing £35,000 worth of damage

A mother-of-two posted a burning birthday card through her boyfriend's front door following an argument, setting his front door on fire.

Faye Hill, 28, posted the flaming card through Graham Dunn's letterbox to 'mark her annoyance in a symbolic manner' but caused £35,000 worth of damage, a court heard today.

The card caused Dunn's front door to burst into flames, setting off the fire alarm as smoke billowed through the 36-year-old's property.

Hill was handed a two-year suspended sentence after she pleaded guilty to arson at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

The court heard how Hill had 'argued throughout the evening' with her boyfriend before deciding to set the card on fire.

After being alerted to the fire, Dunn frantically fought the blaze with the help of a neighbour before firefighters arrived at the house in Stoke-on-Trent on May 12 last year.

Hill was also ordered to undergo up to 60 anger management and alcohol awareness sessions and told to pay £3,000 in compensation.

Judge David Fletcher told her: 'You made the very foolish and extremely dangerous decision to put a lit greeting card through the door to the property Mr Dunn was residing in.

'You walked away, you did not call the emergency services.'

Lawyer Jason Holt, defending Hill, said the relationship with Mr Dunn was 'on-off' and they had argued throughout the evening but that she had not intended to start a fire.

He said: 'It was clear to her at the time of posting the card, not only was Mr Dunn awake, but probably in the vicinity of where it landed.'

'She was aware there was a concrete floor, it is not a case where there was a fitted carpet behind the door.

'She is at a low risk of re-offending, there is nothing to suggest she is a danger to anyone.'

No one in the house was injured.
