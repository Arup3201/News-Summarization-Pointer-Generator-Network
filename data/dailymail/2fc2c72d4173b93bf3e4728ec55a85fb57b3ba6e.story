Romeo Beckham's Burberry modelling debut has been published British Vogue, despite editor Alexandra Shulman saying the 10-year-old was too young to appear in the magazine.

The youngster's shoot has appeared in the February edition of the fashion bible as an advertising feature for the label, even though the publication has new rules about no longer using models who are under the age of 16.

Shulman tweeted that 'Romeo Beckham @Burberry doesn't meet Vogue model health initiative criteria of over 16's only @BritishVogue' on 17 December.

British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman, left, said Romeo Beckham's Burberry shoot did not comply with her magazine's health guidelines, but they have appeared as advertising in the February edition, right

Her Twitter 
followers replied saying the policy should not apply to a child modelling 
children's clothes in a childlike way.

Telegraph fashion writer Rebecca May 
Johnson replied to the editor, saying: It seems unlikely he's exploited 
considering who he is? Not sexualised/under eating etc. I feel like the 
ad pose lets him be a kid.'

Vogue launched their Health Initiative in the June 2012 edition, as 'a pact between the 19 international editors of Vogue to encourage a healthier approach to body image within the industry'.

The aim was to protect young, up-and-coming models from exploitation and sexualisation by no longer 'knowingly' working with them.

Alexandra Shulman tweeted explanations of why Vogue wouldn't use Romeo in editorial, that she had no control over advertising features, and that she felt different rules applied to child actors

The editions also pledged 'to work with models who, in our view, are healthy and help to promote a
healthy body image', and to 'be ambassadors for the message of healthy 
body image'.

Shulman stated
at the time: 'As one of the fashion industry's most powerful voices, 
Vogue has a unique opportunity to engage with relevant issues where we 
feel we can make a difference.'

A Vogue spokesman told the Telegraph 
that in her tweet Shulman meant she would not be using photographs of 
David and Victoria's middle son as editorial - but that the images were 
advertising and therefore not under her jurisdiction, despite the 
magazine profiting from the advert being placed by Burberry.

British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman tweeted that she would not be featuring Romeo Beckham's photo shoot because it did not comply with the magazine's model health initiative

But the magazine has run editorial 
features with young actors, including 15-year-old Chloe Moretz, star of 
Kick-Ass, and Romeo Beckham's modelling co-star Edie Campbell wondered 
why Shulman was happy to do this, tweeting to the editor on December 18:
'@AShulman2 what about features on - e.g. - Chloe Moretz?'

To this Shulman replied:'@ebcampbell pre model health initiative rule. But child actors probably in a different category.'

Responding to speculation over her tweets, Shulman commented: 'When I sent a tweet stating that Vogue's Model Health Initiative would prevent Vogue editorial from employing Romeo Beckham as a model, I meant exactly that.

'In the June 2012 issue, this initiative was launched by Vogue worldwide and prevents us from employing persons under the age of 16 to model adult fashion.

'It made no value judgement about his appearance in an advertising campaign. It also does not mean that we will never feature somebody under 16 in the magazine in any guise, which might include a sportsperson, actor, son or daughter or grandchild or any other role that an under-16 year old might appear.

'Additionally, Vogue does not employ the models that feature in our advertising and therefore the Health Initiative principles do not apply to appearing in an advert placed in the magazine.'
