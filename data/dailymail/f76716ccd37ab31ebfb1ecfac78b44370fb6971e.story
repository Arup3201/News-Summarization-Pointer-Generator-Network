Grabbing her scooter and rushing out to play with friends was nothing out of the ordinary for young teenager Megan Hopwood.

But minutes after saying goodbye to her parents, tragedy struck when the 13-year-old slipped and cracked her head on the pavement.

Police were flagged down by frantic passers-by who found Megan lying unconscious in the street, but despite their efforts she died later in hospital.

'Bright, shining star': Tributes have been paid to Megan Hopwood, 13, who died after she fell off a child's scooter

Last night, Megan’s heartbroken 
parents, Nicola, 31, and Paul, 37, from Whiston, near Liverpool, were 
being comforted by friends and family as they paid tribute to their 
daughter. Her mother said: ‘She got the scooter out of the garden. We 
thought she was talking to friends.

‘As
soon as she came around the corner she must have fallen off. We don’t 
really know how she died. It wasn’t an electric scooter. She had a 
little graze underneath her chin. We presume she knocked herself out and
choked.’

Tests are now being carried out to establish the cause of death following the accident at 9pm on Saturday.

Megan,
a talented singer, was also a keen netball player at her school, Huyton
Arts and Sports Centre for Learning, and had recently been picked to 
represent it in a forthcoming trip to Holland. The Year Nine pupil was 
also said to be a ‘mother hen’ figure to her three younger sisters and 
brother.

In a statement, 
Megan’s parents said: ‘Megan had an outgoing and bubbly character, with a
kind and caring nature. She had an infectious laugh, which captured the
hearts of everyone she met. She seemed to attract people and had lots 
of friends.

‘We will miss 
everything about her; life will never be the same. She has touched the 
hearts of so many people. We have taken some comfort from the lovely 
response within the community, who have paid their respects through 
numerous cards and kind wishes. Megan will be sadly missed but never 
forgotten.’

A tribute page 
for Megan set up on Facebook had almost 5,000  people joining to pay 
their respects, and members of her community are planning to gather 
tomorrow to set off lanterns in her memory.

Mr
Hopwood said: ‘We are so proud of the young lady she was becoming. It’s
just tragic that her life has been cut short in this way. We know 
everyone is feeling our pain with us for our princess.’

Stuart
Jamieson, principal at Huyton Arts and Sports Centre for Learning, 
said: ‘We are greatly saddened by the loss of Megan. She was a very 
popular student and was an outstanding member of our school student 
leadership team.

‘She was 
always willing to give her time to help others and she will be sorely 
missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family at this 
heartbreaking time.’

An inquest into Megan’s death is due to be opened.
