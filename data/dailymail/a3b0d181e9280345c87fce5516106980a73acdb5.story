Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has indicated she could one day be open to running for office.

The only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton has said she is no longer able to completely rule out the possibility of making a political bid if, at some point, she did not support her local representatives.

The 34-year-old suggested she may be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator.

Future bid: Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has said she may one day consider running for office

Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her father, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, suggested she may one day be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator

In an interview, Clinton told Fast Company how ever since being a child she had always been asked about going into politics, with the answer usually being a plain 'no'.

But now, she said, the answer was not so clear.

She said: 'I live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected representatives.

'If at some point that weren't the case, and I didn't support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congressman or either of my senators - and I'm lucky to live in a state where I have lots of women representing me, you know - maybe then I'd have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different answer.'

It is not the first time Clinton, currently vice chair of the recently rebranded Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, has spoken in these terms - she has previously given a similar response to Marlo Thomas, as published on The Huffington Post.

And after delivering a keynote speech at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas last month, she said she was slowly changing her mind about whether to run for office herself in coming years, according to Buzzfeed.

'I donâ€™t know,' she said. 'For a long time, my answer to that question was no.

'At the moment I find it pretty discouraging that almost none of my friends think about running for public office as an option.'

Last month, MailOnline reported on how Clinton told the tech conference what it was like growing up in one of America's most famous and powerful families - and how she learned to debate with them on major issues from the age of six.

And while her father may have been the leader of the free world and her mother the U.S. Secretary of State, criss-crossing the globe solving international crises, they both needed their daughter's help to learn how to text.

'I definitely taught my parents how to text and how to charge their phones,' Chelsea Clinton said, adding the latter was 'a very mysterious thing' for her parents.

Of the mock debates the family would have at home in Arkansas, she told how she would argue with one of her parents and the other would act as moderator.
