Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown may have been slightly premature when he queried whether Radamel Falcao's lifeless outing at Deepdale on Monday night could have been his last in a Manchester United shirt. 

The misfiring Colombian is on loan at Old Trafford for the rest of the season, and United have a £43million option to make the deal permanent.

But here are 10 reasons why they should not.

Radamel Falcao was hauled off on the hour mark after yet another poor display for Manchester United 

Falcao, pictured with Wayne Rooney on Monday night, has managed only four goals form 19 matches

Because he is not worth it... 

When you pay £6m to loan someone and then stump up £285,000-a-week in wages you expect something substantial in return. That has simply not happened.

Even given United's spending power and windfalls from the adidas partnership and new TV deal this is a player who, so far, has not done anything to show why they should splash out £43m to secure his services permanently.

Falcao is replaced by Ashley Young with United losing 1-0. They went on to win the fifth-round tie 3-1 

Lies, damn lies and statistics... 

A Scots poet once said that statistics are used like a drunk uses a lamppost – for support and not illumination. However, they present a compelling case when it comes to the Colombian.

With a paltry four goals in 19 games, Falcao has completed 90 minutes on a mere five occasions. At Deepdale, an hour yielded no shots on or off target, no assists and the grand total of 18 passes.

The Colombian international made his way to the touchline once he realised his number was being held up 

That miss against West Ham...  

Falcao can justifiably point to a lack of chances during his stint in a United shirt. The free-flowing red marauders of recent years now seem a distant memory as Louis van Gaal's men struggle to create openings. 

However, at Upton Park he was given a glorious opportunity. Clean through and with only the keeper to beat Falcao failed to control and prodded a tame volley wide. It was the kind of opportunity you would have expected him to relish and summed up a miserable season.

Falcao spurned a brilliant chance against West Ham which summed up his disappointing season at United 

Powerless at Preston...  

You would have thought Falcao, a man who has shone on the biggest stages, would have been licking his lips at a trip to a League One side.

Not so much. 

Over the course of a difficult hour he failed to trouble an admittedly hard-working and physical third-tier backline and it surprised nobody apart from himself when he was hooked to gleeful cries of 'What a waste of money' from the home support.

Impact on the rest of the team...  

It is just not working. Look at Monday night. After 60 minutes United were a goal down and heading for their earliest end to a hunt for honours in a season for 28 years.

One-paced and one-dimensional, they were playing into burly Preston's hands. 

Off came Falcao, replaced by Ashley Young, and almost immediately they were playing with width and pace on their way to scoring three goals.

This was not the first time Falcao's withdrawal has had a positive impact - something that will not have bypassed the meticulous Van Gaal.

Injury doubts persist...   

This, simply put, is not the same player as the goal machine who succumbed to an anterior cruciate ligament injury last January. He is not sharp and still seems desperately short of match fitness.

Falcao has now made 19 appearances for United - will he will ever regain the sharpness that made him one of European football's hottest properties?

Jorge 'mouth' Mendes...   

The so-called super agent is an influential man and one who has a longstanding relationship with United. But when he starts criticising the manager you have to wonder if he needs reminding of who pays the bills. 

Earlier this month Mendes made the bold claim that Falcao would be firing at United if Sir Alex Ferguson was still manager. With that latest attack he may have sealed his client's fate.

Agent Jorge Mendes appeared to suggest that Falcao would have had more success with former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson rather than under the current regime of Louis van Gaal

Not what United need...  

Van Gaal's relatively late arrival at Old Trafford meant that, for the second summer in a row, there was a lack of proper planning behind the club's moves in the transfer window. 

As a result, the Dutchman appears to have ended up with pieces from separate jigsaws. He knows that United need pace up front – that's why he's started untested rookie James Wilson ahead of Falcao more than once. 

With targets already identified for this summer United will not make the same mistakes twice.

Confidence issues...  

When you own a gold-plated mobile phone, pick up £285,000-a-week and have God-like status in your homeland you would imagine confidence is not an issue. But for Falcao it clearly is. 

The pressure of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world coupled with the feeling that this season is a test created by the £43m clause appear to be weighing heavily on his shoulders. A striker without confidence is a striker without goals.

Old father time...  

Van Gaal has always been a fan of promoting youth, something he did to great effect at Ajax. Falcao turned 29 earlier this month. If the deal was to be made permanent he would be looking for at least a three-year agreement which would take him to 32.

United have moved away from their policy of not signing players without a resale value recently but in this case Falcao's age as well as his form is likely to count against him.
