Manchester United are attempting to solve their crippling injury list by poaching Southampton’s first-team physio Matt Radcliffe.

Louis van Gaal has nine players out with injury ahead of this weekend’s Barclays Premier League fixture with Everton.

Radcliffe is regarded as one for the best physios in football and his last game before he joins United will be Southampton's trip to White Hart Lane on Sunday.

The experienced physio has been lured to United at a time when they are attempting to speed up the recovery rates of a number of their most influential players.

Michael Carrick (ankle), Marouane Fellaini (ankle), Phil Jones (hamstring), Ashley Young (groin), Jonny Evans (ankle), Chris Smalling (hip) and Ander Herrera (ribs) are among nine players in the medical room at Carrington.

Radcliffe, will be on the bench at Saints for this weekend’s reunion with former manager Mauricio Pochettino before he starts his new role at Old Trafford.

He is joining United to replace Rob Swire after the long-serving medic retired in the summer and Neil Hough was promoted at Carrington.

United insist that Radcliffe’s arrival is totally unrelated to the new role created for fitness coach Tony Strudwick.
