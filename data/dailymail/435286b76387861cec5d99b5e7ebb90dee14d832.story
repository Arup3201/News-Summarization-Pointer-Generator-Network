There's a certain stereotype that portrays sulking teenagers trawling the internet for hours on end, sharing infinite details about their terrible lives.

However it seems that the kids have been overthrown for the title of most time spent online, by an unlikely competitor.

During December of last year, teens spent a measly average of 14 hours and 42 minutes surfin' the web, while their parents and grandparents spent more than 32 hours online.

Over 55s have overtaken teenagers and jumped up to the second highest internet users in Australia, according to new research by Roy Morgan

The over 55's averaged over an hour a day, according to new research released by Roy Morgan and consolidated by The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).

Despite this, people in the 18-54 year old bracket topped the charts, spending an average of 40 hours and 21 minutes connected for the month.

The study also revealed that teenagers are not the key drivers of growth online, due to their lack of funds and dwindling financial independence.

Almost 100 percent of teenagers have broadband internet at home and the use of smartphones is increasing across the board

Most Australian teens are jumping online to entertain themselves, the research found

'Compared to adult Australians teenagers—not-surprisingly—generally have lower incomes and fewer opportunities to fully benefit from online transactional activities, content and services,' ACMA reported.

Nearly 100 percent of teens have a broadband internet connection at home, 69 percent have a smartphone and 72 percent jump online more than once each day.

And it seems Aussies are leading the charge on smartphone ownership, with just 36 percent of Americans in the same age bracket owning the clever little devices.

Teenagers are visiting Google, Facebook, Youtube, Mi9 and Microsoft the most

The top five destinations for younger Australians were Google, Facebook, Youtube, Mi9 and Microsoft and in an unexpected turn of events 9 out of 10 of them gravitate towards the internet for entertainment.

Adults overtook their kids when it came to making transactions online, proving that more and more older Australians are turning to the internet to bank or buy and sell items.

The more mature members of our population are also utilising the online world in more versatile ways, as they juggle four or more activities each time they log on.

Across the board, Aussies are making the switch to mobiles in lieu of traditional desktops with the gap in usage between the two devices narrowing in the last four years.
