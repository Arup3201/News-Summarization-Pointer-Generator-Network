The Islamic State group has released at least 200 Yazidis after five months of captivity in Iraq, mostly elderly prisoners who may have been slowing the extremists down.

General Shirko Fatih, commander of Kurdish forces in Kirkuk, said almost all of the freed prisoners are in poor health and bore signs of abuse and neglect. Three young children are among them.

The militants transported the captives from the northern town of Tal Afar, where they were being held for the past five months after the militants raided their towns last summer. They dropped them off at the Khazer Bridge, near the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil.

A mentally disabled Yazidi man laughs as he is carried to the bus: Gen Fatih said it appears the Islamic State militants released the prisoners because they were too much of a burden.

Gen Fatih said they are now being held by Kurdish authorities for questioning.

He said it appears the militants released the prisoners because they were too much of a burden.

'It probably became too expensive to feed them and care for them,' he said.

Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled in August when the Islamic State group captured the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar, near the Syrian border. But hundreds were taken captive by the group, particularly women.

Iraqi and international authorities later said that some Yazidi women were sold into slavery.

Hersh Hussein, a representative from the Irbil governor's office who was in Alton Kupri, said the condition of the released captives was 'very bad, especially the psychological condition.'

'Regarding other diseases we provide first aid and the most important medical treatment,' he said.

Maha Faris Qassem, 35, was released with her two young sons, both of whom were covered from head to toe in inect bites which appeared to be infected.

She said the conditions of their captivity were so dire that infection was inevitable.

About 50,000 Yazidis - half of them children, according to United Nations figures - fled to the mountains outside Sinjar during the onslaught. Some still remain there.

'I don't know the details of why they released us,' Gawre Semo, 69, told The Associated Press.

'They are very bad people. They took our children and they took the women. They did bad things with us. We've been humiliated by them.'
