Former Rolling Stone Bill Wyman has said that he approached police over widely reported claims he had sex with a minor – and was told that they were not interested.

The ageing rocker, now 76, famously began courting Mandy Smith when she was 13 and he was 48.

They married, disastrously, when she was 18, but her mother joined them on honeymoon and they spent less than a week of married life together.

She claimed they had sex when she was 14, and her sister called for the ex-Stone to be prosecuted.

Wyman insists he has nothing to be 
ashamed of – but amid a swirl of celebrity paedophile allegations 
sparked by the unmasking of the late Jimmy Savile, the star has finally 
revealed he took the initiative to contact detectives himself.

He and Miss Smith had married  in 1989, parting and divorcing soon afterwards.

He later left the Rolling Stones under
 a cloud, and despite playing with the now super-rich band last year, it
 appears he is yet to be fully reconciled with them.

But Wyman is still forthright about 
his relationship with the girl more than three decades his junior who 
became his second bride.

Now married to third wife Suzanne 
Accosta, by whom he has daughters Katherine, 18, Jessica, 17, and 
Matilda, 14, Wyman said of his love affair with a schoolgirl: ‘It was 
very emotional and special at the time. It wasn’t how it was reported to
 be and it was the only time it ever  happened in my life.

‘A lot of people understood, but a lot didn’t, and the media certainly didn’t. They treated me like c**p.’

Admitting he avoided talking about 
Miss Smith because it upset his wife and teenage girls – ‘who are the 
age she was’ – Wyman said: ‘We all have a skeleton in the cupboard, it’s
 just if you’re a taxi driver in  Halifax no one ever hears about it.

‘But if you are a celebrity  everyone 
does. In my case it was publicised to the world and that wasn’t really 
fair, I don’t think.’

He said: ‘I went to the police and I 
went to the public prosecutor and said, “Do you want to talk to me? Do 
you want to meet up with me, or anything like that?” and I got a message
 back, “No”.

‘I was totally open about it.’

The Metropolitan Police refused to comment on Wyman’s claims.

The star, who married first wife Diane
 in 1959, went through his first divorce in 1969 after joining the 
Rolling Stones plunged him into a world of groupies, from whom he 
reportedly picked favourites while playing bass on stage.

He has boasted of bedding a thousand 
young women, and first met 13-year-old Mandy Smith when she was dancing 
at London’s Lyceum ballroom with her elder sister.

He has said she made him feel as if he
 had been ‘whacked over the head with a hammer’, and he promptly began 
helping her find work as a model.

He has claimed she was ‘a woman at 13’
 and pointed out her mother did not object to their relationship, 
despite his age and reputation.

For two-and-a-half years their affair 
was a closely guarded secret, but when it became known they wed in a 
civil ceremony, then went on Terry Wogan’s TV show.

Their divorce led to a £580,000 payout to Miss Smith, and he  married for a third time just five months later.

But Wyman had not quite escaped his 
past, and events later took a still more bizarre turn when his son 
Stephen, 30, became engaged to Miss Smith’s mother Patsy.
