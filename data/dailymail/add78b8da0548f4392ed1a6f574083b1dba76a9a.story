How many sexual partners have you had? If the answer is five then the search for 'the one' could be over.

MSN have developed a love formula that can work out the key ingredients for a successful long lasting relationship, and it has revealed that the number of sexual partners someone has can affect their relationship success.

The formula has been devised for those 
looking to give their love life a bit of a spring clean - be that by 
taking their relationship to the next level or by completely 
re-evaluating it.

A new study reveals that we tend to settle down with our fifth sexual partner as that is when we are most sure of what we want from a relationship

According to the 2,000 men and women surveyed to create the formula, we are most likely to settle with lover number five.

Exactly a quarter (25 per cent) of both men and women believe their partner should have had a fair amount of experience with four sexual partners before them - though one in five men (21 per cent) are holding onto tradition believing they should be their ideal woman’s FIRST partner.

Being funny is a big turn on apparently as when it comes to personality, the 
number one character trait both men and women search for in a partner is
 wit.

How you act between the sheets also matters. Some 26 per cent of men believe that a successful relationship 
needs to involve good sex in order to succeed where as only 13 per cent of 
women believe this to be true.

The Love Formula is a slightly complicated mathematical puzzle, but psychologist Corrine Sweet believes it's not to be sniffed at and really could help us work out if we're with 'the one'

1) Firstly, multiply the amount of years you knew each
other before you became an item by .5 then add the number 8 to this number.
Let's call this total number the 'special number'

2) Separately, add together the number of previous
partners for both people and multiply by .2. Minus this total from the special
number total

3) Multiply 9 by the importance the male attaches to
honesty (importance is ranked at 1 to 5 where 1 is least and 5 is most important).
Add this to the special number total

4) Then add the value the woman places on money (scale of
1 to 5 again) multiplied by 3 to the special number

5) Add together the importance both place on humour
(using the scale of 1 to 5 again) and add this to the special number

6) Multiply the value both place on good looks (added
together) by .3. Minus this number from the running special number

7) Separately, minus the importance the female places on
sex from the amount the male places on sex. Multiple this result by .5 then
square the result (i.e multiply it by itself). Minus this result from the
special number

8) Add the importance the couple attached to inlaws
(added together) to the special number

9) Multiply the importance the couple places on children (added
together) by 1.5, then add this number to the special number

9) The final 'special number' is the amount of years
you'll be together

MSN’s relationship expert and psychologist Corinne Sweet says that the reason we wait till partner number five to settle is because we are most sure of ourselves then.

'Most people enter a serious relationship, hoping it will last forever.  Few know that it’s only by the time they get to sexual partner number five that they really know what they want, and are confident to voice it. 

When it comes to personal traits both men and women search for good wit in a long term partner

'Good looks might help sexual attraction, but they don’t last forever, so it’s important to look at your partner’s personality, wants and desires as well.'

She goes on to say that the MSN love formula is not something to be sniffed at and can really help us work out what we want from a relationship.

'The MSN Spring love formula can help determine the traits we should be looking for.  It can even indicate how long a relationship might last based on compatibility and mutual goals.  Forewarned is forearmed, even in love.'

Michael Walter from Winchester, Hants, has been with his girlfriend for two years and spent ten minutes working out the equation of the MSN love formula.

The 30-year-old said: 'I spent a few minutes working out the formula and it revealed I will stay with my girlfriend for 33 years and 3 months.I'm delighted with the results, we've only been together for a year and a half and these results are promising.'

Although Michael was pleased with his long lasting result he was a little concerned as to what might happen once the 33 years are up.

Although we do not have plans to get married, 33 years is incredibly encouraging, though I do wonder what is going to happen at that point!'
