The Wu-Tang-affiliated rapper who chopped off his own penis has denied reports that doctors re-attached the member - but insists he sees it as a 'blessing'.

'I definitely believe sex is for mortals, and I am god. So this is a blessing, not a curse,' Andre Johnson, who goes by the stage name Christ Bearer, told the New York Daily News.

But he explained that he still has part of his penis left and can still get aroused.

The 41-year-old Northstar rapper sliced off his genitalia inside his North Hollywood apartment on April 16 before jumping from the second floor, in what authorities branded a suicide attempt.

On the mend: Andre Johnson, who goes by the stage name Christ Bearer, said he still has some of his penis left after he sliced it off while high on PCP in April - but the rest of it was not reattached by doctors

But he has since rebutted the report, insisting that he was simply high on PCP. The psychedelic is known for causing people to jump from ledges because they think they can fly.

'It's a drug that I had stopped doing for years, but I just got back from Ohio and got back into that lifestyle for a few days,' he told the Daily News. 'It definitely was not wise.'

A 911 call from the incident later revealed his panicked friends pleading for help.

'We have a friend over here and… we 
don’t know if he’s alive or not [after jumping from] the second floor… I
 don’t believe this s**t,' said the unidentified person.

As police arrive at the apartment, the caller can be heard saying: 'You gotta come get him, he cut his 
damn penis off. We were sitting on the 
balcony and this mother f****r just came and [jumped]'.

After the incident, his penis was found upstairs in his apartment and Johnson was hospitalized at the Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

Johnson later told TMZ that, ahead of his self-castration, he had been sinking into a depression, smoking weed and reading a book about monks and vasectomies.

He
 said he felt his 'world was collapsing' after being prevent from seeing
 his two daughters due to a restraining order, and that he had a third 
child on the way.

Mutilation: Johnson, right, said he had been reading a book about castration before taking the drug

Just two weeks after the incident, he welcomed a new daughter, Kennedy. He also has two other daughters, Lana, 2, and Lauren, 8.

Despite saying that the penis was not reattached, he has recently said he wanted to star in porn.

‘Does it work?!? Can Chris Brown dance? 
Can Kanye West rant? Can Jay Z fight off a trick?’  he said when TMZ asked about his injuries a couple of weeks ago.

He made a plea to the adult entertainment company Vivid to feature him on one of its X-rated movies.

Founder and co-chairman of Vivid 
Entertainment, Steve Hirsch, has reportedly told TMZ that he is 
definitely interested in featuring Bearer but wants to check out his 
injuries before making an offer.

Northstar
 is described on the Wu-Tang website as a duo from the north side of 
Long Beach who have produced songs warning of the dangers of drugs and 
saluting their own Muslim beliefs.

In 1998, they were discovered by Wu-Tang member RZA, who produced some of their albums.

As
 Johnson's unfortunate incident hit headlines, RZA moved to distance 
himself for the rap duo, releasing a statement he has had nothing to do 
with them for 10 years.
