Army, Navy and RAF personnel are poised to take over duties from prison and probation officers if they conduct an illegal strike.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed servicemen and women are being trained for the positions as trade unions consider industrial action over the private running of jails.

Forces are learning how to conduct non-prisoner-facing duties such as patrolling jail borders and checking CCTV.

Change of pace: Army personnel are among those who will be on prison duty if the strike goes ahead

After being deployed they will have six hours notice to reach the prisons if a strike does take place.

Six state-run British prisons and one other are up for competitive tender and their futures are set to be decided within a few weeks.

Private security firms G4S, Sodexo and Serco are among the bidders and if they win they may choose to make some prison staff redundant which could provoke strikes.

Officers and ranks from 12 RAF bases were brought in for training in Cambridgeshire at RAF Wittering.

An MoD spokesman explained: 'The Armed Forces routinely train for a range of contingencies, but such training does not mean that personnel will necessarily deploy.

'The MOD has a long-standing contingency arrangement with the Ministry of Justice to provide assistance in the event of unlawful strike action by prison officers.'

Training: Members of the RAF have already gone to Cambridgeshire to learn the required skills

A tasking order sent to RAF officers by Headquarters Air Command shows the National Offender Management Scheme (NOMS) has notified the MoD that they will need help, as revealed by the Daily Telegraph.

The order reads: 'NOMS has given the MoD official notice in order to force generate and train personnel to undertake non-prisoner-facing duties in support of NOMS in the event of industrial action in prisons in England and Wales.

'From the day of activation, personnel will be held at six hours notice to arrive at identified prisons.

'All personnel will be able to maintain this state of readiness from their parent unit.'

The Prison Officers' Association denied all knowledge of the strike on Friday night but because they are banned by law from taking industrial action they rarely declare their intentions in advance.

In May around 80 per cent of jails lost their staff to a surprise strike targeted against public sector reforms, although it only lasted a few hours.

Exercise was cancelled and prisoners were kept in their cells with only a few staff on hand to provide them with food and medication.

Even criminal court proceedings were put on hold because captives could not be taken to court as the guards had left their posts to protest.

The Ministry of Justice insisted on Friday night that they are planning to avoid a strike and will try to keep close relations with unions in order to do so.

Servicemen and women are no strangers to helping out where required, with over 18,000 assisting at the London 2012 Olympics.
