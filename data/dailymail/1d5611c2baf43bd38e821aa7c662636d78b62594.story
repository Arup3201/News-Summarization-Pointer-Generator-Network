Thousands of fervent football fans have fancied their chances at Spot the Ball, while countless other punters have had a crack at it too.

After all, just how hard could it really be to place the position of the ball missing from a football live action photograph? Well, as it turns out, extremely hard.

So hard, in fact, that no one has won the game’s £250,000 jackpot for more than a decade, it was revealed yesterday.

Peter Cook, 66, discovered the jackpot drought as he confronted organisers in frustration at winning just a £10 and a couple of £2 vouchers despite spending about £1,300 over 11 years

No one has won the game’s £250,000 jackpot for more than a decade. Mr Cook, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, said: ‘If no one won the National Lottery jackpot for that long there’d be an outcry'

Some 14,000 people a week regularly play the Football Pools-run game, but the last time anyone actually managed to pinpoint the ball exactly was in 2004.

The jaw-dropping discovery was made by Peter Cook, 66, when he confronted organisers in frustration at winning just £10 and a couple of £2 vouchers despite spending £1,300 over 11 years.

Mr Cook, a retired local newspaper editor of Nuneaton, Warwickshire, said: ‘If no one won the National Lottery jackpot for that long there’d be an outcry.

‘It’s ridiculous. By the laws of probability you’d have thought someone must have won it by now.’

In its Seventies heyday Spot the Ball was played by three million people a week. But interest fell after the National Lottery was launched in 1994.

The weekly game has some 14,000 devotees paying a minimum 50p for 50 guesses but no one has scooped the top prize since 2004

Die-hard Spot the Ball fan Mr Cook puts £2.50 a week on 1,000 crosses. Players are provided with specially printed sheets of small stick-on crosses allowing them to cover areas of the competition photo with blocks of guesses if they wish.

But frustration at winning so little over the years drove Mr Cook to contact the organisers about when anyone last scooped the jackpot – which, unlike the Lottery’s, does not roll over each week if not won.

Yesterday a Football Pools spokesman said: ‘Players of the Spot the Ball game have won £16million in prizes over the last ten years.

‘The top prize is won by guessing the exact centre of the ball but this has not happened since 2004, reflecting the fact that fewer people play the game.

‘However, the £16million has been paid out to weekly winners for other prizes on offer, including for being closest to the centre of the ball.’

The last winner of the jackpot was a grandmother who won the £250,000 prize after a tip from beyond the grave from her dead mother.

Irene Robertson, then 69, of Conisbrough, South Yorkshire, said after winning that her mother Alice had told her at a seance: ‘Don’t forget the coupon,’ just before she had planned to stop her £3 weekly flutter on the game after 40 years of playing.
