Barcelona presidential candidate Agusti Benedito has revealed that Lionel Messi has received 'really big offers' from top European clubs and even believes the club's board have thought about selling him.

Reports that Messi was unhappy and was considering leaving the Catalan giants surfaced earlier this season after the player fell out with manager Luis Enrique.

The Argentina forward was even linked with Jose Mourinho's Chelsea after Messi followed the club's Instagram account.

Current president Josep Maria Bartomeu has always maintained that Messi wants to end his career at Barcelona and the club would not comtemplate selling their star player, but Benedito claims his comments should not necessarily be taken at face value.

'They have shown in the recent past that their public quotes don't always correspond with their ideas,' the 50-year-old told Goal.com.

'Sometimes they say things and then their actions go in the opposite direction. I hope in Messi's case that their words and their actions correspond.

'Perhaps they had other ideas, despite what they have said publicly. And it's a worrying issue because at times it has seemed like they are really not concerned with keeping Messi happy.

'Some of their decisions, their quotes and their actions make me believe they were contemplating other possibilities.

'Messi has had really big offers from teams in different countries,' Benedito added. 'But I believe he genuinely wishes to end his career at Barcelona.'
