Police are considering giving the details of homeowners who are burgled after leaving doors or windows unlocked to insurance firms.

Officers say the move to jeopardise victims’ insurance payouts is designed to make people take their security more seriously.

Senior Tameside police want to cut the number of so-called ‘insecurities’, which account for a third of burglaries in homes across the Manchester borough every year.

Currently, insurance firms ask burglary victims for crime reference numbers but rarely request further details from officers.

Chief Inspector Steve McFarlane, of Greater Manchester Police, said it was rare for insurers to call officers, adding: ‘Usually the crime number is taken on face value.’

Police admit the move, which is thought to be a first, will be unpopular but say homeowners must take responsibility for their actions.

It is more difficult to trace burglars who don’t have to break into a property but simply enter through an open window or door.

Chief Inspector McFarlane added: ‘We have had reductions in burglaries year on year but an area we haven’t been able to tackle effectively is insecurities.

‘We’ve raised awareness in the media, leafleted properties. You can tell people but whether they act on it is a different matter.

‘If you leave your keys in your car when you are defrosting it and someone drives off in it the insurance company don’t pay out. What’s the difference between leaving your engine running to leaving your door unlocked?’

Thieves are often in and out in seconds, making off with handbags, laptops or car keys.

Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley said: ‘Is it right that those who do take care should be forced to pay higher premiums because of those who just can’t be bothered to lock the door?

‘It’s going to be unpopular but it’s something I will defend.’
