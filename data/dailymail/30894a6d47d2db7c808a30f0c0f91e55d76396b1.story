It is already America's longest war, but a new draft of a key U.S.- Afghan security deal reveals plans for military forces to stay on indefinitely in Afghanistan- costing the taxpayer tens of billions.

The wide ranging document, obtained by NBC News, outlines plans to stay on until 2024 'and beyond' - maintaining bases in Afghanistan and paying to support and train hundreds of thousands of Afghan security forces.

Afghan officials hope that up to 15,000 American troops will remain in the country after the scheduled 2014 withdrawl date as the United States faces a never-ending war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in the war torn nation.

The 25-page 'Security and Defense Cooperation Agreement Between the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan' is to be debated in Kabul this week by 2,500 academics and tribal elders in an event known as a Loya Jirga, which is Pashto for 'Grand Assembly'.

Indeed, Afghan president Hamid Karzai has said that he wont sign it without the approval of the Jirga.

The draft agreement has been the result of back and forth negotiations between U.S. and Afghan officials and reveals multiple concessions and revisions.

Under the new definition of relations between the two nations, Afghanistan would allow the U.S. to operate military bases, train their security personnel and to conduct counter-terrorism operations against al-Qaeda after the current mission is due to end in 2014.

The agreement also makes provisions for the U.S. to fund and equip Afghanistan's police and security forces, because Kabul cannot afford it at the moment.

The deal between the two nations would take effect on January 1st, 2015 and 'shall remain in force until the end of 2024 and beyond.'

However, with two years notice from Washington or Kabul the agreement could conceivably come to an end.

One issue of contention between the two nations was in the July draft stating that American troops would have to train and plan their war on terror from the security of their bases and not be allowed to travel around the country.

In addition, U.S. troops would not be allowed to make arrests or enter Afghan homes.

'No detention or arrest shall be carried out by the United States forces. The United States forces shall not search any homes or other real estate properties,' it says.

This caused consternation as high up as the President, and is described by senior defense officials as the one issue which could derail the entire deal.

However, a newer draft that has been seen by the Obama administration seems to suggest that United States forces will be allowed to leave their bases and conduct full operations within Afghanistan.

The question of how many troops will remain is still up for negotiation, with Afghan officials telling NBC that they hope 10-15,000 will stay.

U.S. officials tell NBC News the number is closer to seven to eight thousand, with an additional contribution from NATO.

Regardless, committing tens of thousands of troops to a minimum decade-long mission will cost the taxpayer billions.

U.S and Afghan officials believe the presence of American troops in the country will help the government establish itself in the long term and reduce the chance of the country slipping back into civil war.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council did not comment on the draft version of the agreement, but said that 'the President is still reviewing options from his national security team and has not made a decision about a possible U.S. presence after 2014.'
