Didier Drogba turned back the clock to open the scoring before Robin van Persie left it late to net an injury time equaliser at Old Trafford.

Jose Mourinho was left fuming by the late lapse of concentration that saw the spoils shared with his former mentor Louis van Gaal. 

Here Sportsmail's Neil Ashton gives his verdict on how the players performed...

Robin van Persie slammed home an injury time equaliser to share the spoils at Old Trafford

Didier Drogba slides on his knees to celebrate after scoring the opening goal for Chelsea

MANCHESTER UNITED 

David de Gea: Decent save from Drogba in the first half, commanding presence at the back. No chance with Chelsea goal. 6.5

Rafael: Sending off waiting to happen. Booked for hitching a lift on Hazard’s back. Marking Drogba at a corner is crazy. 6

Chris Smalling: Seems ridiculous to say it but he’s turning into an accomplished centre-half. Decent smothering job. 7

United defender Rafael (right) was cautioned for pulling back Eden Hazard in the opening exchanges

Marcos Rojo: Still getting to grips with the game here. Has looked more comfortable at left back than in the centre. 7

Luke Shaw: Total inexperience down the left with the former Southampton defender having Januzaj for company. Weird. 6.5

Angel di Maria: Needs to be on the ball more, but always a threat at set-pieces. His ball in from the left after 93 minutes spared United. 7

Daley Blind: Spends too much time sitting in front of the back four when he can influence the game from more advanced positions. 6

Out of favour Marouane Fellaini (right) was given a rare chance to stake a claim in United's midfield

Marouane Fellaini: The temptation is to bury him as always, but he actually did a decent job of shackling Fabregas in open play. Met Di Maria free kick that led to RVP equaliser. 6.5

Adnan Januzaj: Another odd selection decision, playing a young player in a team struggling for confidence. Never got past Ivanovic. 5.5

Juan Mata: Was he playing? 4.5

Robin van Persie: Smashed in the equaliser and what a way to celebrate. Denied twice by Courtois in the first half, much improved on his recent performances. 7

Manchester United's Juan Mata failed to seize another opportunity to impress Louis van Gaal

MANAGER 

Louis van Gaal: Never once got off his seat in the dug-out. Didn’t even look bothered. Left it all to Giggs. Very, very bizarre behaviour. 6.  

Subs: James Wilson (Mata 65) Talented boy being asked to do a man’s job when United were 1-0 down. 6. 

CHELSEA

Thibaut Courtois: No chance with RVP equaliser. Great save from van Persie midway through first half, denied him again moments later. Saved again from the angle in second half. 7

Branislav Ivanovic: Booked in first half and was then draw into a confrontation that led to United’s free kick and incredible equaliser. Stupid. 5

Gary Cahill: The bigger the game the bigger the performance from the Chelsea defender. Almost at Terry’s imperious level now. 7

Branislav Ivanovic (L) was sent off in the dying minutes before Chelsea conceded an equaliser

John Terry: Van Persie got away from the Chelsea defence a couple of times in the first half, but usual reliable self. 7

Filipe Luis: Di Maria always threatened to be a handful but he didn’t get on the ball enough. 6.5

Nemanja Matic: Bundled over RVP in first half, asking to be booked and was. Otherwise solid in the centre of midfield. 6.5

Cesc Fabregas: Subdued when it looked like the game was all set up for him to boss it in the middle of the park. Still, he now has eight assists this season. 7

Chelsea's Brazilian forward Willian skips past Manchester United midfielder Daley Blind (L)

Willian: Impressive going forward, but his lack of pace lets him down when he has a free run on goal. Committed to defensive responsibilities. 6

Oscar: Phenomenal work rate, even if he left his A game at home. Booked for foul on Rojo. Eventually substituted 6.5

Eden Hazard: Through on goal in 52nd minute, De Gea saved brilliantly. That save led to Chelsea’s goal. 7

Didier Drogba: Brilliant header, towering above Rafael to put Chelsea in front. Has an incredible record against United. Booked for foul on Mata. 7.5

MANAGER

Jose Mourinho: Spent the entire game in the technical area. Fuming that lack of concentration at the end led to noted equaliser. 7

SUBS 

John Obi Mikel (Oscar 65) Sent on to do a job in the middle of the park and to stop Fellaini’s influence. 6.5

Andre Schurrle (Hazard 89) Came on at the end to see the game out for Chelsea. 6.

Kurt Zouma (Willian 90). Timewasting exercise. 6

REFEREE 

Phil Dowd: Looking a bit fuller again, but most of his decisions - especially the bookings - were spot on. First half headlocks were physical confrontations on both teams. 8
