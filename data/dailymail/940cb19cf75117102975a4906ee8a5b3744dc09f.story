Marouane Fellaini has vowed that his nightmare first season at Manchester United has made him a stronger player.

The much-maligned midfielder endured a disappointing first term at Old Trafford as the deposed Premier League champions finished seventh.

Fellaini's £27million transfer to the club move from Everton, in August last year, still causes much derision among many Red Devils' supporters who have been unimpressed with his performances in midfield.

The 26-year-old is currently working his way back to full fitness after suffering an ankle injury at the start of the season, and the Belgian international has revealed that United boss Louis van Gaal has assured him that he will get opportunities to stake a claim in the first team.

'I talked to Van Gaal, and he has never said that I had to leave. He said I had a lot of competition, but that I got the chance to prove it [that I deserve to play],' Fellaini told Sport Wereld.

'I have known difficult moments last season, but there is a stronger player afterwards. I have confidence in myself and in my game again.

'I played a good World Cup and also during the preparation, I was good. It is unfortunate that this injury is for now just a spanner in the works, but at the end of the month I will be back.'
