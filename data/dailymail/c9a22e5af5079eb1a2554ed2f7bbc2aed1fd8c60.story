If you're in the market for some $100 million bling, a Fifth Avenue diamond dealer-to-the-stars claims to have the rarest 'super gems' on Earth.

From the newly trendy $1 million 'Power Rings' popular on Wall Street to 100 carat diamonds for the mega-rich, David Birnbaum and his extensive network of contacts scour the globe for the most incredible rocks.

His company Rare 1, located above New York's Fifth Avenue, are specialists in top-of-the-line goods - diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires and pearls, selling to 'VIP clientele types.'

Fifth Avenue brands such as De Beers and Cartier sell their sparklers to the top 2 per cent of the population, on average.

But Birnbaum deals with an even more elite slice of the market - the top 0.1 per cent only, otherwise known as the mega, mega rich.

Fortunately for Birnbaum, these people are heads-of-state or genuine Hollywood A-Listers leading luxurious lifestyles with deep pockets and money to burn.

Birnbaum, who lives in New York, said: 'What we do lies on the border between mission impossible and mission possible - we have to keep finding ever-more unique and ever-more special gems all the time.

'Our primary clientele are from the top 1/10 of 1 per cent of the global financial elite but over the years we have developed a dynamic and loyal client group ranging from young bankers to heads-of-state.

'But it's not all about money - a lot of things still need to align for the sale to go through.

'A Royal wedding or an Academy Awards show or a new Ambassadorship also help, of course.'

Birnbaum and his contacts scattered across the globe track down the ultimate rocks - sometimes with a specific gem in mind and other times with the goal of finding a never-before-seen gem.

While many are discovered in Russia some have only ever been found in more remote areas such as Africa - but he is always there to source the goods all around the world to beat his competition.

Birnbaum was taught the basics of the diamond trade by his dad Andor Birnbaum and the father-and-son team started the current business in the 1960s.

Today, he is the leading private jeweler in the U.S.

'People know we have the ability to move these incredible high-end goods so we get shown the product early,' he said.

'In business sellers have to find the right buyer and vice versa - it's exactly the same with super gems.

'Rubies and diamonds and not going to lose value, they are a solid investment. We were unaffected by the financial crisis.

'These days we are almost competing with ourselves to find even rarer gems which have never been seen before. It's all about quality, beauty and value - we manage to pull it off.'
