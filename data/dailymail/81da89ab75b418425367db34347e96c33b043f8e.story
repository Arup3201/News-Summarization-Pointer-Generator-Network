It's a scene to stir the blood of any petrol-headed Englishman, a fleet of Jaguars worth a combined £500,000 crossing Westminster Bridge in the early morning light.

But rather than a scene from a James Bond film or a new street track for a Grand Prix, the cars were actually being filmed for a new advert.

The company brought brand new models from its luxury range down to central London early this morning to shoot a patriotic new commercial to market the quintessentially British brand around the world.

The car firm recently signed up David Beckham as a brand ambassador in China in a bid to further push its British credentials and it is rumoured the former football and global superstar could feature in the new advert.

Early morning runners and dog walkers on the banks of the River Thames had to double take as they spotted the expensive fleet of cars roaring across the famous bridge.

Three Jaguar XFs - worth at least £30,000 each - and three F-Types - each worth more than £50,000 - cross Westminster Bridge flanked by a Range Rover during the filming of a new advert this morning

Roads in the capital were closed off this morning so the company - based in Whitley, Coventry - could the film the advert

The sportscar firm brought in a helicopter to shoot the advert, which is set to the backdrop of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament

Another driver uses the aerodynamics system of F-Type Coupe, which has a starting price of £85,000 and can do 186mph

Jaguar chose the early hours of a quiet Good Friday morning to have streets usually packed with tourists and traffic closed off for the shoot

The cars roared back and forth across the bridge near Parliament Square as cameras on helicopters and on cranes attached to other vehicles filmed footage for the new advert
