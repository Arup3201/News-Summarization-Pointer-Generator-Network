A new exhibition in Germany about archaeology under the Nazis shows how the regime launched a 'Last Crusade' expedition in wartime to find the Holy Grail from the Last Supper of Christ.

In the 1989 Last Crusade movie, Indiana Jones played by Harrison Ford was on the quest for the grail - and he was in competition with the Nazis.

Now truth turns out to be stranger than fiction in the exhibition 'Dig for Germania. Archaeology under the Swastika' in Bremen. It tells how S.S. chief Heinrich Himmler allegedly visited Spain during the war because he believed the grail was at the Montserrat Abbey near Barcelona.

The chief architect and manager of the Nazi Holocaust believed that finding the grail 'would help Germany win the war and give him supernatural powers.'

Squads of S.S. men searched in vain for the grail. The S.S. budget for such projects was vast as the Nazis intended their finds to rewrite history to prove Germans were the greatest race in all history.

Before Hitler came to power there were just a handful of professorships in archaeology; afterwards there were 24, all tasked with promoting this claptrap theory while finding as many rare artefacts as possible from around the globe.

'If we want to again become a large, 
single people, we must build on the time, where the Nordic racial 
nucleus was still pure and unadulterated and which combined with a 
splendid culture which influenced all over Europe,' said Hans Reinerth, 
Hitler's favourite archaeologist.

Hunting on a hunch: Himmler believed the grail was at the Montserrat Abbey near Barcelona but never found it

Far
 from being the 'King of the Jews,' Himmler shared the hocus-pocus 
belief with his boss Hitler that Jesus Christ was actually descended 
from Aryan stock - the race which Hitler decreed was to rule the world 
for 1,000 years.

'This is the time of Germanic 
antiquity, the German prehistory', he added. Visitors to the exhibition 
are informed: 'The Nazis sought to establish the image of blonde, 
blue-eyed heroes and conquerors who were the ancestors of the Germans 
and that their race was summoned for world domination.'

When the Nazi war machine rolled 
eastwards to conquer the Soviet Union in 1941, the archaeologists were 
in their wake, using slave labourers to dig up evidence of 'German 
superior race-colonies' that inhabited the lands back in the distant 
past.

The exhibition tells the visitor that many died in the hunt for 
artefacts trying to underwrite this racial myth.

'Archaeologists
 often planned these crimes or worked on their own initiative', said 
historian of Dirk Mahsarski, who curated the exhibition hall at the 
Bremen Focke Museum. 'There are a whole bunch of archaeologists of whom 
we can safely say that they knew about the Holocaust and the suffering 
of forced laborers.'

The exhibition chronicles how two of the Third Reich's most powerful men - Himmler and Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi party racial philosopher - competed with separate archaeological teams to dig for artefacts to support Nazi theories. Himmler even sent a team of S.S. men to Tibet before the war to try to discover the mythical lost kingdom of Shangri La.

Mostly the Nazis discovered pottery and bits of jewellery, all of which were used to promote their berserk racial theories; the treasure, like the Holy Grail, eluded them.
