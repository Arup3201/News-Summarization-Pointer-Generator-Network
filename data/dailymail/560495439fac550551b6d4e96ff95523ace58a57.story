A 26-year-old man who died this weekend after a battle with a rare disease will continue to live on in the lives of his wife and 1-year-old baby thanks to 30 letters he left behind.

Mitchell Whisenhunt of Longview, Texas died Saturday from complications due to Marfan's Syndrome, a disorder that affects the heart valves and aorta often leading to early death. 

Soon after her husband's passing, wife Ashley Whisenhunt discovered a batch of letters he left behind for both her and their young daughter.

The thoughtful gift is reminiscent of the novel and later movie P.S. I Love You, in which a young widow (played by Hilary Swank), helps grieve after the loss of her husband to a brain tumor with the letters he leaves behind  

In one of Mitchell's first letters, he writes: 'If this is being read, I have passed...In this grieving period for my wife, the last thing I want her to worry about is the coming cost of my funeral.'

The family is currently fundraising on GoFundMe to pay for his memorial costs. 

Mrs Whisenhunt told KLTV of how surreal it felt to discover the letters, each written for special occasions like an upcoming anniversary. 

'Honestly I thought he was going to come back in and read them to me I guess,' Mrs Whisenhunt said. 

She says the most special letters, however, are addressed to their 1-year-old daughter, for which there are letters each year from ages two to 18. 

Mrs Whisenhunt says she will wait to let her daughter open them on each special occasion. 

The Whisenhunt family plans to hold a memorial service later this week.
