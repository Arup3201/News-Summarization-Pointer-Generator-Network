My hero: Sam Nye was saved from an attempted rape attack by her son Jamie

A mother was saved by her 10-year-old son when she was attacked by a stranger in her own home.

Sam Nye said she felt ';absolute terror' when an unknown man entered her house in the early hours of Friday morning and attempted to rape her

The 31-year-old said it was her son Jamie’s call for his mother which stopped the attack.

Mother-of-five Sam had enjoyed a night in with her friends at her Middlesbrough home and was on her laptop while her children were asleep upstairs.

Sam said: ‘My friends had just gone and I was sat in the living room and a man walked in and said “is Harry here?”'

After informing the stranger that she was alone with her children, she got up to walk him out and lock the door.

As the man went to open the door he turned on the spot and hit her in the face.

The man dragged Sam into the living room before pinning her down on the floor.

She said: ‘I knew what he was going to do. He was going to rape me. I felt powerless. He was really strong and I couldn’t move.

‘There was nothing I could do.‘

As the attacker struggled with her trousers, Sam heard Jamie call her name.

‘Jamie never wakes up in the night. But for some reason he did that night.

'He called “mum” and I shouted to him to go back to bed, and that everything was ok because I didn’t want him to come downstairs and find me like that.’

She says her son’s voice affected the man he stopped trying to undo her trousers.

‘He got off me and kept saying “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry” before leaving.’

Sam believes the man did not rape her because of her son's calls for her.

‘The only reason he didn’t rape me is because of Jamie. I am so grateful to him for calling for me.

Single mum Sam immediately called the police and went to the father of her two youngest children while police investigated the crime scene.

Sam is hoping to become an archaeologist and is due to start a course at Middlesbrough College next week but says she is so traumatised by the attack she cannot even think about leaving her house, let alone use public transport.

Police are continuing to investigate the attack which happened just before 1am on Friday, August 24.

Saved: The single mother-of-five was attacked in her own home by a stranger who she says tried to rape her, but the assailant stopped and ran off when he heard Jamie call for his mother

Sam, who runs an online fancy dress business, has waived her right to anonymity to talk about the attack.

‘I can’t believe that someone could do what he did. It petrifies me that he is still out there.

’I am in absolute terror that he comes back or does this to someone else. All I want is for him to be caught.’

The man is described as white, in his early twenties, less than 6ft 2ins tall, of medium build, wearing a black jacket, dark tracksuit bottoms, with a deep voice and local accent.

Detective Inspector Jim Devine of Middlesbrough CID said: ‘Offences of this nature are isolated but are very frightening for those involved.

'We have a number of officers working on this investigation and we would like to reassure the community that we are doing everything we can to trace this man.

‘The suspect is believed to be from the local area and we would again appeal for anyone with information to get in contact with us.’

Police believe a man who was seen in a nearby alleyway at around 12.15am may have information. He is described as 20, 6ft tall, of muscular build and of a tanned or Asian appearance.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Middlesbrough CID on the non-emergency number 101.
