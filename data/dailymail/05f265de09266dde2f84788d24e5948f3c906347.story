Nearly 7,000 properties in England and Wales will be allowed to fall into the sea this century, it was revealed today.

The homes and buildings - worth more than £1billion combined - are expected to be victims of coastal erosion because that is much cheaper than protecting them, according to experts.

More than 800 of these properties will go in the next 20 years, and homeowners living in them now face the prospect of being forced to move to a safer area with no compensation scheme in place.

Collapsed: A house falls over dunes into the sea after storm damage at Hemsby in Norfolk in December 2013, following the 'most serious' tidal surge to hit the east coast of Britain for 60 years

Off the cliff: Severe storms in December 2013 saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of England - and at Hemsby (pictured) in Norfolk, coastal erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea

Environment Agency analysis, revealed by Guardian reporter Damian Carrington, suggests the most at-risk area in the next two decades is Cornwall, with 76 properties expected to be lost.

And three local authority areas are forecast to lose more than 250 properties each when looking a century ahead - these being Great Yarmouth (293), Southampton (280) and Cornwall (273).

Severe storms in December 2013 saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of England - and at Hemsby in Norfolk, cliff erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea.

Coastal community campaigners claim that the Government should do more to help residents living in vulnerable areas move elsewhere, if it cannot defend their properties.

Professor Rob Duck, a coastal erosion expert at Dundee University, told the Guardian: ‘It is a very difficult issue, but we can’t defend everything at all costs.

Mapped out: The EA figures presume that funding is maintained for  'shoreline management plans', which include four policies to either 'advance the line', 'hold the line', 'managed retreat' and 'no active intervention'

‘There are just not the resources to do it and keep on doing it. But it is not just about money, often people have lived in places for generations and there is a lot of history and memories.’

The figures from the EA presume that funding is maintained for what are known as 'shoreline management plans', which include four policies to either 'advance the line', 'hold the line', 'managed retreat' and 'no active intervention'

There would be more than 74,000 properties lost in the next century without this intervention.

Current guidance from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says more than 200 homes are at risk of being lost to coastal erosion in the next 20 years.

But the EA analysis puts this at 295, or 430 in the case of very extreme weather. Last year’s tidal surge which hit the east coast was described as the ‘most serious’ for 60 years.

Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes as tides in the North Sea reached higher levels than the 1953 floods, and two people died - in West Lothian and Nottinghamshire. 

Falling value: This three-bedroom bungalow with views over the North Sea in Happisburgh, Norfolk, was bought for £20,000 in 1987 - and the Daily Mail reported in 2008 how it was worth £1. The owners left in 2011

An EA spokesman told MailOnline ‘The recent announcement of £2.3bn of investment over the next six years will see significant investment in coastal flood and erosion risk management, with 15,000 properties better protected from coastal erosion over the next six years.

‘The Environment Agency uses a range of advanced techniques to monitor and assess the causes and impacts of coastal erosion.

‘We work with local authorities, which lead on shoreline management plans, to identify erosion risk management schemes, coastal erosion monitoring and further research on how we best adapt to these changes.’

And a Defra spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We are spending more than £3.2billion over the course of this parliament on flood management and protection from coastal erosion - half a billion more than in the previous parliament.

‘Our first ever long-term investment strategy for flood defences will see a further 15,000 houses better protected from coastal erosion by the end of the decade.

‘Local authorities are best placed to manage the risks to their coastline and government help is available to assist with the costs associated with the loss of a home to erosion.’
