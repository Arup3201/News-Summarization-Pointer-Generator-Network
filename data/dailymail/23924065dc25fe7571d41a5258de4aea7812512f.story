A fast food takeaway has been forced to reprint its menu after it accidentally offered its customers Aborigines as a pizza topping on its vegetarian option. 

The blunder happened due to a production error when somebody mistook Aborigine for aubergine and unfortunately, thousands of flyers were distributed with the embarrassing typo to houses across Southend-on-Sea, Essex. 

Super Pizza, who produced the leaflet admitted that the inclusion of the unusual antipodean ingredient was 'a mistake'.  

The popular takeaway was forced to reprint thousands of menus after the unfortunate typo was spotted

The flyer offered customers the chance to buy a 19-inch pizza which they claimed was the largest on offer in town for £10,99.  

A spokesman for the shop said: 'It was a mistake. We don't want to comment any further.' 

Following the embarrassing blunder, the shop has reprinted a new version of the menu with the correct spelling of aubergine - which, despite being a type of fruit, is commonly used as a vegetable.  

One diner Richard Coombes, 27, from Rochford, Essex, said: 'I couldn’t believe it when I saw it.

'I’ve heard of typos but this takes it to another level.

'I had to ask my girlfriend to check if I was seeing things.'

The Aborigines, also known as Aboriginal Australians, were the original inhabitants of Australia before the British colonized the country in the late 18th Century.

The new version of the menu has replaced Aborigines with aubergines making it acceptable to vegetarians

Mr Coombes added: 'We definitely steered clear of the vegetarian option after that.

'I love the Aussies but I wouldn’t want to eat them on a pizza.'

Staff at Super Pizza, in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, have since explained the odd topping had been an innocent typo and should have read aubergine.

A spokesman for Super Pizza Ltd explained individual branches are responsible for their own leaflets.

JUST EAT, which provides access to the company for online orders, declined to comment.
