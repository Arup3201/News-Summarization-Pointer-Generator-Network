They've had it good for six weeks with some beautiful autumnal sunshine, but the future of Occupy Wall Street now hangs in the balance - as the weather turns and snow storms threaten the U.S.

Protesters were waking up in their tents at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan this morning after a freezing cold night to the prospect of the first snowfall before Halloween in New York City since the Civil War.

And following a day of rain on Thursday, their moods were further dampened today after the city's authorities took away the generators they were using to keep warm and power electronic devices.

Chilly: Christopher Guerra, from San Francisco, California, is wrapped in a blanket to stay warm as he participates in the Occupy Wall Street protest at the Zuccotti Park encampment on Friday in New York

Wet: A man sits under an umbrella in Zuccotti Park at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in New York

Cold: Protesters in Zuccotti Park on Friday, when temperatures were hovering just below the 50F mark

An Occupy Wall Street spokesman said
this was 'a pretext to make the protest less sustainable and more 
difficult for us', but authorities insisted they had to remove the 
equipment for safety reasons.

A blanket of cold air that brought the
first flurries of the season to Colorado on Wednesday is continuing to 
spread south and east, bringing the lowest temperatures since spring.

The expanding cold pocket yesterday brought snow to 
parts of Pennsylvania, New York and New England, and a second storm
looks set to powder all the major east coast cities this 
weekend.

The unusually early snow is bad news 
for those camping in city centres across the country, as critics speculate that the days of the Occupy movement may now be numbered.

Not moving: Many of the protesters say they will not be leaving the camp in New York, but that remains to be seen as temperatures plunge this winter and the snow begins to fall

Gone: A generator is seen at the site of the Occupy Wall Street Protest at Zuccotti Park in New York on Thursday, before it was sezied by city fire department officials during an early Friday morning inspection

For
the last 45 days protesters - who are angry about corporate greed, 
inequality of wealth and lack of public health care provision - have 
occupied a park near Wall Street in Manhattan, New York.

'I
welcome the challenge of this cold weather. This is like war. You know,
soldiers do it when they occupy a place. I'm sure the mountains of 
Afghanistan get pretty cold'

Dwayne Hudson, Denver protester

The demonstrations have grown, spreading across the country and to other cities around the world in recent weeks.

But give
inches of wet snow fell in Denver yesterday, shrinking the numbers of overnight protesters to a 
hardcore of just 25. Several of them had to be taken to hospital to be treated for
hypothermia.

'I welcome the challenge of this cold weather,' protester
Dwayne Hudson said. 'This is like war. You know, soldiers do it when 
they occupy a place. I'm sure the mountains of Afghanistan get pretty 
cold.'

Silence: New York protesters ask members of the public and other demonstrators to keep the noise down

Extreme: The future of the Occupy Wall Street movement hangs in the balance, as snow storms threaten cities across the US.

Protesters
struggled to shield themselves from wind and rain at Zuccotti 
Park on Thursday - their mood dampened further by the dismal 
weather predictions.

Around 30 Tennessee protesters were arrested in Nashville at the site where a few dozen have been encamped for about three weeks.

Authorities began moving in after 3am this morning using a new state policy that set a curfew for the grounds near the state Capitol, where the protesters had been staying. 

But later this morning, a Davidson County Sheriff's Office spokesman said the arrested protesters were being released after a night court judge would not sign the warrants. 

Protester Steve Reiter, who works closely with the group's legal team, said he believed there were problems with how the protesters were taken into custody. He described their release as a victory for Occupy Nashville.

Living outdoors is taking its toll. Lael Gillette, 27, an unemployed chef from Rockford, Illinois, has had only two hours of sleep in three days at the camp. 'I would rather there was another option,' he said.

Protesters
have erected tents and tarpaulins over parts of the concrete park, but 
appeared to be failing in their battle to keep warm and dry.

Some demonstrators in New York avoided 
the wet weather on Thursday by huddling in a local art gallery run by 
Trinity Wall Street church with free internet access, reported the New 
York Post.

Meanwhile, the protests now have the support of David Duke - arguably America's most infamous white-power advocate and a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

'I cheer the men and women on the streets condemning the international banks that hold America financially hostage,' he said in a video.

Snowscene: The unusually early snow is bad news for those camping in city centres across the country.

Resilient: 25 protesters slept at the Occupy Denver camp overnight on Wednesday even as the winter snow storm moved in. Several were taken to the hospital for hypothermia.

Authorities will welcome the dramatic
weather forecast. Law enforcement officials in some cities such as Oakland, 
California, have cleared out protests.

'I would rather there was another option'

Lael Gillette, New York protester

But New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said there is little he can do
about the New York protest until the owners of the park where the camp is located, Brookfield 
Office Properties, file a complaint.

Earlier
this month he suggested that many protesters were only 
camping out because of the unusually warm autumn weather. Now observers will watch what happens as the mercury plunges.

Stoic: A blanket of cold air, that brought the first flurries of the season to Colorado on Wednesday, is continuing to spread south and east, bringing the lowest temperatures since last spring.

Camp Crazy: A snow-dusted protest sign sits under a tree at the 'Occupy Denver' camp

A dramatic drop in temperature across the southern plains is expected on Friday. Meanwhile, farther north on the East Coast, as much as six inches of snow will fall on higher ground.

Occupy San Diego protesters were cleared out of their camp in an overnight raid.

Early this morning, authorities in riot gear took over a site that has occupied a downtown area for three weeks.

One
officer used a loudspeaker and told the group to leave the site. 
Protesters chanted in response: 'This is what democracy looks like'.

But they were all directed out of the area several hours later, reported MSNBC. Police said their camp was illegal.

Temperatures will plummet with some 
areas of the north east such as Syracuse reaching lows of 27 at night. 
In major cities such as New York and Boston overnight temperatures 
will remain in the 30s.

The north east will experience a widespread freeze on Friday, forecasters said.

Then another powerful storm 
gathering momentum along the mid-Atlantic coast has the potential to 
bring very early season snow to major cities such as New York, 
Philadelphia and Boston on Saturday.

Accuweather 
meteorologist Elliot Abrams said: 'The amount of rain versus snow that falls 
on various communities in the I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to New
York and Boston Saturday will be a matter of a few degrees.'

Snow this heavy this early is highly 
unusual along and near I-95 in the Northeast. In Philadelphia, the 
average date for the first accumulating snow is December 18.

Downpour: Protesters take shelter at their Zuccotti Park camp in Manhattan in the face of a day-long deluge of rain. More bad weather is on its way

Weathered: Mayor Bloomberg has blamed the continuing protests on the warm early fall

Changing: Mike Esperson, 22, from Queens, New York, who woke up to find himself soaked from rain at the Occupy Wall Street protest camp, picks up free donated clothes at the Zuccotti Park comfort station

Volunteers are being vigilant and do nightly checks for signs of hypothermia among the faithful.

'There’s meditations that you can do to 
heat yourself up. Hot thoughts. Like summer, or fire, anything that’s 
hot, you know what I'm saying? And it works'

Ed, New York protester

Ed, a 56-year-old volunteer medic from Maine, told New York magazine, 'It’s a combination of being wet and cold that starts the hypothermia. We patrol at night looking for people shivering.'

Trench
foot is also becoming a problem. Jeremy, a 25-year-old who has been 
homeless for three years has come up with a homemade solution.

He explained: 'I
actually originated using newspaper - newspaper and cellophane. You put
the cellophane on first, and then you put the newspaper, and that keeps
you warm,

'And there’s 
meditations that you can do to heat yourself up. Hot thoughts. Like 
summer, or fire, anything that’s hot, you know what I'm saying? And it 
works.'

The expanding cold air brought snow to parts of Pennsylvania, New York and New England yesterday and a second storm has the potential to powder the major east coast cities at the weekend

Long haul: Zuni Tikka, 37 helps fortify her makeshift tent in Zuccotti Park as cold wet weather moves in. She has been part of Occupy Wall Street since the day it began on September 17th

Upside down: Occupy Oakland protesters share a group hug and another does a headstand in the new encampment in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza in Oakland, California

The cold weather will add to the 
Occupy movement's existing problems. On Tuesday, police evicted activists
in Oakland using used tear gas and stun grenades.

In
New York mediation is under way between demonstrators and some of the 
movement's musicians, who were drumming up to 10 hours a day.

'The quantity of (occupiers) will go down, but the quality will go up'

Lauren Gigion, New York protester

And
protesters staffing the camp's kitchen - which Occupy Wall Street says
feeds up to a 1,000 people daily - have downsised their menu to deter 
the homeless and freeloaders who have been taking advantage of the 
hospitality.

Not everyone is worried about numbers dropping off. Lauren Gigion, a leader on the sanitation team told New York magazine that 'the quantity
of (occupiers) will go down, but the quality will go up.'

Secret preparations for the bad weather are also underway. Gigion added: 'I can’t tell you what people are planning exactly,' said Gigion, 'Because the NYPD will shut it down.'
