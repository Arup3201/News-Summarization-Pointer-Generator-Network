An animal lover is facing a charge of animal cruelty after she was found covered in blood and holding her dead dog.

Sammie Bruhwiler, 22, was discovered by police holding the dog, understood to be a shih tzu, after officers were called to the scene on Thursday night.

According to police, Bruhwiler, of Oklahoma City, told officers she had been trying to cut the dog's fur to get rid of puss and fleas.
