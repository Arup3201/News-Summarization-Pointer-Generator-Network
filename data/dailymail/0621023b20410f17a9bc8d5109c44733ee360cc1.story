Junior Hoilett has been left out QPR’s squad for the game at Stoke on Saturday ahead of his expected move to Borussia Monchengladbach.

The 24-year-old winger is poised to join the German club on loan with a view to a permanent deal after the clubs discussed terms on Friday.

Derby County retain an interest also but have also spoken to Hull about Tom Ince.

Queens Park Rangers winger Junior Hoilett is wanted by Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach

The 24-year-old has struggled for first team opportunities this season, with just 17 appearances

Hoilett arrived at Loftus Road with a fine reputation after impressing at Blackburn, and even turned down a move to then Champions League hopefuls Borussia Monchengladbach. 

The Canadian, who has made 76 appearances for the club, has a £7m release clause in his contract but the clubs are discussing a compromise fee.

QPR remain interested in Standard Liege winger Paul-Jose M’Poku, 22, while a deal for Bakary Sako depends on the Wolves player changing his wage demands.

They could also see Matt Phillips leave the club this transfer window with Hull, West Brom and Derby chasing the former Blackpool winger.
