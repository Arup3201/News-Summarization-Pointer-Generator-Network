Facing jail: Emily Fox, 26, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust

A lesbian PE teacher faces jail today after admitting having sex with a 15-year-old student  she taught at a £24,000-a-year private school for girls.

Emily Fox, 26, who can be named for the first time, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.

She met the girl when she taught her at the Royal Masonic School for girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire.

The games teacher taught there for a year.

Today, Fox of Bath, Somerset, admitted the charges at St Albans Crown Court.

Defence barrister Dee Connelly asked for the case to be adjourned for a pre-sentence report. 

She said the sentencing guidelines starting point for the offences was four years in jail with a range of three to seven years.

Judge Michael Baker QC adjourned sentence until 5 September and granted Fox bail. 

He said she must now register as a sex offender.

He said bail should continue with the condition that Fox does not attend the Royal Masonic School and has no contact with anyone aged under 16.

The girl cannot be identified, but Judge Baker lifted a contempt order that had prevented publication of the defendant’s name and the name of the school. 

The judge said: 'It is clearly in the public interest to identify the school as well as the defendant. It is, to my knowledge, by no means a small school.

'I don’t see how the identification of the school leads to the identification of the child.'

The Royal 
Masonic School for Girls takes both day and boarding pupils aged seven 
to 18, with a pre-school which takes pupils from the age of two.

It was founded in 1788 to educate the daughters of Freemasons who were unable to support their families.

Its famous buildings have been widely used in films and television including two Indiana Jones films, in Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Last Crusade.

The site was used as one of the locations for a film called Me and Orson Welles starring Zak Efron.

It also featured in an episode of Inspector Morse.

Famous former pupils include Wendy Richard, who played Pauline Fowler in EastEnders, and actress Amelia Warner.
