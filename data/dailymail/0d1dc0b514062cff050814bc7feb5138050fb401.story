The chief of an Alabama police department is giving one of his officers a chance at redemption after a video of the officer drag-racing with a pedestrian with his city-issued motorcycle went viral on the Internet, prompting the officer to turn in his resignation.

Montgomery Police Chief Kevin Murphy has reinstated officer Carlos Rogers, who is seen on video drag-racing with a motorist on a busy street not once, but twice.

Murphy says Rogers' willingness to take responsibility for his actions - by resigning without being told to do so - played a part in his decision to reinstate him.

Embarrassed: After seeing the video, Rogers says he was so embarrassed by his actions that he resigned

The incident occurred on Sunday, when Rogers pulled up to a red light and a man on a motorcycle next to him asked him if he wanted to race.

'I got a turbo in this thing,' Rogers told the pedestrian, before speeding away on his police motorcycle.

Rogers and the pedestrian, identified as Lawrence Lee Spillers, came to a second red light, at which point they raced again.

Spillers recorded the entire incident on a camera attached to his helmet, and insists that neither he, nor the officer, ever went faster than 60 mph.

Spillers says he think the officer was 'just trying to have a good time,' and that he shouldn't lose his job over the incident.

Murphy, however - before deciding to reinstate Rogers - told CNN that the officer handled the situation horribly, and could potentially face a traffic citation in addition to quitting his job.

According to Murphy, when Spillers asked Rogers if he wanted to race, the officer should have responded, 'no, young man. I write tickets for that and I don't suggest you do it.'

On Thursday, however, Murphy changed his tune and decided that Rogers is an officer 'worth saving.'

'He cared so much and felt so bad he hurt us that he decided to step 
down,' Murphy said. 'A man like that, in my book, deserves a second 
chance.'

Rogers explained his actions as an attempt to comradery with a fellow biker, and to demonstrate that police officers aren't always aggressive and combative, and can sometimes even be friendly.

But after seeing the video, Rogers says he felt like he let the department down.

'I saw the video and I was called in about it, and I decided to resign because I was embarrassed,' Rogers said. 'I couldn't take the embarrassment that I knew was going to follow that. I never intended to bring a negative view onto the city, to the Montgomery Police Department or myself.'

Rogers, who has been with the department for four years - and part of the traffic division since April - has returned to active duty, but will be assigned to administrative duties temporarily, as Murphy says the officer will need to earn his way back onto the streets.

Murphy says he often warns young officers that their generation will the most scrutinized because of cell phones and social media.

'For every cellular phone in the room, there are an equal amount of cameras and also the ability to take video footage,' Murphy said. 'The point is, the camera is always on. And your actions, no matter what they are, are going to be scrutinized.'
