The newlywed accused of pushing her husband off a cliff just eight days into their marriage was too ashamed to face her family after he asked her for an annulment, it was claimed today.

Montana bride Jordan Linn Graham, 22, pleaded not guilty to murder charges last week after she was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the death of her husband Cody Johnson.

Police believe the newlywed pushed her husband off a cliff in Montana's Glacier National Park after a heated argument.

'One of the police theories is that the new bride "snapped" after her husband figured out she had lied about being in love with him. She was only in love with the idea of being a bride,' a source close to the investigation told the National Enquirer.

Second thoughts: Ms Graham told a friend the morning of the day her husband went missing that she was doubting the viability of the ill-fated marriage

The source also revealed that authorities believe Cody told her he 
wanted a divorce or an annulment and she couldn't face telling her friends 
her husband already wanted out of the week-old marriage, so she came up with a crazy plan to kill him and make it look like an accident, it is believed.

The couple had been together for less than two years when they got married and it is said both of them were having doubts about tying the knot.

A friend of the accused murderer told
the Enquirer: 'Jordan was a dreamer who was more excited about the idea
of marriage than actually being married.

'She loved picking the wedding dress 
and showing off her ring, but on the day of the actual wedding, she 
sobbed uncontrollably.' 

The Kalispell woman has insisted from the very beginning that her husband's death was an accident. Their tragic story has garnered national media attention almost from the very beginning, with Graham even pleading her case on magazine covers.

Married only eight days when Mr Johnson, 25, disappeared July 7, Graham first told investigators that Johnson's 'buddies from Washington probably came and got him,' according to the indictment.

Investigators have accused the widowed woman of pushing her husband off a cliff down onto a viewing area known as the Loop during a July 7 argument after having second thoughts about the marriage.

Reported missing on July 8 when he did
not show up at work, authorities were unable to find Mr Johnson's body 
until July 11 when Graham told officials she found it in the hard to 
reach spot after she thought to look there.

Ms Johnson cryptically told investigators 'it was a place he wanted to see before he died'.

As time wore on, and investigators began piecing together their case against Graham, her story began to change.

Having first told authorities that 
her dead husband drove off in a dark car the night he disappeared, 
Graham admitted July 16 they had an argument at the park the night he 
died.

Graham told investigators she and Mr Johnson
argued on the trail. When he grabbed her 
arm as she turned to walk away, she pushed him with both hands in 
the back, causing him to fall head-first from a steep cliff, according to an 
affidavit.

Earlier that day, Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about getting married and meant to talk to Johnson about it, according to the affidavit. She said if the friend didn't hear from her again that night, 'something happened.'

Two people who knew the couple told local Montana newspaper that they had their doubts about the wedding.

'We
all had our reservations about their relationship,' Levi Blasdel told 
the Daily Inter Lake. 'She seemed so remote from the relationship, so 
withdrawn.'

That emotional distance carried over to her husband's funeral.

'At the funeral, a number of us had spoken, and while I gave my memorial for Cody at the podium, she was messing around on her phone,' said Mr Blasdel.

'It was very hard for all of us to be there crying and mourning the loss of our friend and she was so unresponsive to that, really no emotion, no crying, very sober,' he added.

Not a care in the world: Those who knew her said Ms Graham carried on with her life like nothing happened in the days after her husband's death

Her behavior stood in stark contrast to the crying woman seen before she walked down the aisle at her wedding, Mr Blasdel explained.

Despite Ms Graham's unusual reaction to the death of her husband, no one suspected her in the death. It was not until she kept trying to explain the circumstances surrounding his disappearance that doubt began to creep in.

'I don’t think anyone suspected her directly until all of us heard different stories from her,” Lytaunie Blasdel told the Daily Inter Lake. 'That’s when it got weird.'

Another friend told authorities that Ms Graham confided during a church service that her husband had died after falling off a cliff - this conversation is said in the affidavit to have happened the day before she 'found' his body at the base of the cliff.

Ms Graham had appeared in court last month on a second-degree murder charge and was released after the judge deemed her not to be a flight risk. She is currently in the custody of her parents.

If convicted of first-degree murder, Ms Graham faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. She is due back in court Oct. 15.
