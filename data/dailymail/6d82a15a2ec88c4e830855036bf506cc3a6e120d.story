Dozens of people are being infected with the deadly Ebola virus each day in Sierra Leone, as the terrifying disease tears through the country's capital city, Freetown.

Yesterday, forty-nine new cases were confirmed in just 24 hours, the National Ebola Response Center (NERC) reported. So many people are succumbing to the deadly virus that removing the dead bodies is becoming a serious problem. 

Lawmaker Claude Kamanda who represents a western area of the country said that more than 20 deaths are being reported each day.

He told the local Politico newspaper that authorities are experiencing challenges collecting corpses from both quarantined and non-quarantined homes.

Sierra Leone is one of three West African nations at the epicenter of the worst outbreak of the disease on record.

According he latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has killed more than 4,500 people since first appearing deep in the Guinean forest last December.

Authorities say the uncontrolled movement of people from the interior to Waterloo - which is the gateway to Freetown - has fueled the increase of Ebola cases in the west.

There are 851 total confirmed Ebola cases in the  Western Area Urban and Western Area Rural zones, NERC reported.

In terms of numbers of cases, the two western zones may soon surpass a former epicenter of the outbreak in Sierra Leone - the eastern districts of Kenema and Kailahun where there have been a total of 1,012 confirmed cases.

No new cases were reported yesterday in Kenema and Kailahun but a WHO spokeswoman said it is too early to declare that the epidemic has burned itself out in the east.

'There was a drop in new cases in Kenema and Kailahun and fingers were crossed but there has been a bit of a flare up thanks to a couple of unsafe burials,' said Margaret Harris, WHO's spokeswoman in Sierra Leone. 

'So it's too early to say we have a real decline ... definitely too early to say it's been beaten there.'

The World Food Program delivered emergency food rations to people in Waterloo over the weekend, as local media reports suggest the western city may also have to be quarantined.

'The growing fear has left the public with no choice but to call on the Government for Waterloo to be quarantined as was done to other places including Kailahun, Kenema, Bombali, Port Loko and Moyamba Districts,' the Exclusive newspaper said.

Most of the Ebola cases are still found in the eastern districts of Kenema and Kailahun but the disease seems to be taking a hold in the western areas of the country and spreading through the capital city, Freetown

Many residents of the capital note that Ebola has followed the same route across the country as rebels who in 1991 started a savage war in Kailahun district. 

The war ended in Freetown a decade later where the final battle was fought. Now the enemy is a disease, and the president is putting in place a  military-style response.

President Ernest Bai Koroma last week appointed Defense Minister Alfred Palo Conteh as CEO of NERC.

Although no cases of Ebola have emerged there, the east African nation of Rwanda was today singling out travelers from the U.S. and Spain for special screening.

Ebola cases have emerged in both the U.S. and Spain but the virus has been contained. 

A Rwandan Ministry of Health document says all passengers from the U.S. and Spain will have their temperatures taken upon arrival. If the passenger has a fever he or she is denied entry.

If there is no fever, the visitors still must report their health condition daily to authorities.

The U.S. Embassy in Rwanda has urged Americans who may have a fever or who have traveled to Ebola countries 'to weigh carefully whether travel to Rwanda at this time is prudent'.

'Please note neither the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs nor the U.S. Embassy have authority over quarantine issues and cannot prevent a U.S. citizen from being quarantined should local health authorities require it,' the embassy said.
