Jose Mourinho is to contest his FA misconduct charge when he makes a formal submission to the governing body before Tuesday’s 6pm deadline.

The Chelsea manager was charged after claiming there is a ‘campaign’ against the Barclays Premier League leaders when they were denied a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Southampton on December 28.

Mourinho, who has generally toned down his comments since his return to English football, has the full support of the club in his case.

The Chelsea manager can make representations to the FA disciplinary commission by way of mitigation, but it appears he is most likely to highlight his concerns by requesting a personal hearing.

It is understood Mourinho will put together video evidence to support his claim that match officials are failing to award his team key decisions in matches.

Mourinho lost control at St Mary’s when referee Anthony Taylor booked Cesc Fabregas for simulation when the Spaniard appeared to be fouled by Southampton defender Matt Targett.

At the time he said: ‘There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don't know why there is this campaign and I do not care. Everybody knows it was a penalty.’

Since the charge he has taken a vow of silence and refused to speak with the media ahead of Saturday’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge.

The Chelsea chief sent his assistant coach Steve Holland instead, and it was his deputy who again spoke to the media after the win over John Carver’s Magpies side.

An FA statement released last week said: ‘It is alleged his remarks constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of a referee or referees and/or bring the game into disrepute.’

Mourinho has already been issued with a formal warning following his demand for a ‘strong referee’ ahead of Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stoke City on December 22.
