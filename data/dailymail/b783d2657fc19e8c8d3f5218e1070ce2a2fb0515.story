Without doubt the worst foul of the evening was by Paris Saint-Germain’s Marco Verratti on Eden Hazard and replays confirmed my initial thought that the over-the-top tackle should have meant the French side were reduced to 10 men. 

Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir merely showed him a yellow card when a red one would have been the proper response.

Cakir was understanding and tolerant most of the time and as long as you like the game to be physical he was consistent.

But if there was anything Chelsea could object to in the referee’s performance it was the continual fouling by former Chelsea player David Luiz, which went unpunished.

While he could not be accused of making one really bad challenge, the number of offences he committed meant he should have been subject to disciplinary action.

In fact, despite the physical nature of the match, which Cakir was happy to allow most of the time, only four players were booked — two from each side. A stricter referee might have handled things very differently.

Branislav Ivanovic headed Chelsea in front in the first half with their only shot on target, before Edinson Cavani nodded home an equaliser nine minutes after the break.

Some fine saves from Thibaut Courtois to deny Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Luiz kept the Blues level, before Ramires was fortunate not to concede a penalty late on after blatantly tripping Javier Pastore inside the Chelsea box.
