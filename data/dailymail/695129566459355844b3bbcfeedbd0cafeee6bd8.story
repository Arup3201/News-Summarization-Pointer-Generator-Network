A photographer with a special knack for aerial shots has put New York City into perspective by only looking down on it from above.

Jason Hawkes boasts a portfolio of hundreds of thousands of aerial shots from all over the world and has produced 40 books of aerial photography.

But there is something especially stunning about the City that Never Sleeps when seen from the top down and Hawkesâ€™ method of getting his birds-eye-views are equally inspiring.

The intrepid photographer takes most of his shots from the passenger seat of a helicopter. While tethered in for dear life, he leans out the window and...voila.

From his vantage, sunsets in the city are even more riveting, the nightlife looks all the more exciting, and a walk in the park becomes an adventure into urban wilds.
