There may be many things we don't understand about the universe, but one thing we can be certain of is that the speed of light cannot be exceeded. Right?

Not necessarily, according to one scientist. He claims that a certain effect may be capable of producing the illusion that 'spots' of light travel faster than lightspeed.

And his research says that when this occurs, the spots produce a phenomenon known as a 'photonic boom'.

A scientist from Michigan Tech University studied faster than light effects. Dr Robert Nemiroff said a laser swept across the moon (telescope laser shown) will appear to break light-speed. This is because it will move from one end to the other before light on the surface could make the same journey

The controversial study was carried out by physics professor Dr Robert Nemiroff from Michigan Tech University, and he recently presented his research at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle. 

He claims that if you shine a powerful enough laser pointer on the moon from Earth and sweep it across the surface, the 'spot of light' could appear to move faster than the speed of light.

This is because, in this hypothetical scenario, if another person standing on a moon attempted to shine a light across the moon at the same time, it would take longer.

When a plane travels faster than the speed of sound, the sound waves it creates are unable to propagate away as normal and instead build up, creating a sonic boom of noise.

A similar effect can also be observed with regards to light, emitting something known as Cerenkov radiation in the process.

Note that this is different to the 'photonic boom' effect described by Dr Nemiroff.

The Cerenkov radiation effect occurs when something travelling at, or near, the speed of light in a particular medium - such as air - moves into a medium where the speed of light is slower - such as water.  

In air, the speed of light is about 984 million feet (300 million metres) per second.

In water, however, it is less at 738 million feet (225 million metres) per second.

This means that if particles move from air to water they can break the speed of light in the water.

The moment they do this they slow down to the new speed, but in the process release a particular type of radiation - known as Cerenkov radiation.

The effect occurs in nuclear reactors, which are encased in water.

When neutrinos leak out, they slow from the speed of light in air to that in water.

In the process they emit Cerenkov radiation, which appears as a blue glow. 

'The stream of particles (photons) from your laser pointer can sequentially impact the moon so that another light beam - confined to the surface of the moon - could not keep up,' Dr Nemiroff told MailOnline.

In his paper he explained that, although light takes about 0.0116 seconds to cross the moon, a person standing on Earth can sweep a laser pointer across the moon's surface in less time. 

Such sweeps in the universe are known as 'superluminal sweeps' - superluminal meaning faster than light.

And when this spot first strikes the moon, Dr Nemiroff said it can create a flash to an observer, which he calls a photonic boom.

Although not the same as a sonic boom, this would be an indicator that the spot is moving faster than the speed of light.

Dr Nemiroff further explained that the 'spot' moving across the moon is not actually a physical object - so it is not breaking any laws of physics.

'Each photon that strikes the moon is unconnected to other photons that strike the moon,' he said.

But while the photons in the beam move at the speed of light, the spot itself seems to move faster. 

'Nothing physical is moving faster than the speed of light,' he added.

'In this sense, the superluminal motion inherent in a photonic boom is an optical illusion brought about by the timings of unrelated photons striking - and being scattered by - the moon. 

'One analogy is the sonic boom as when a supersonic airplane flies by overhead, people at different locations will hear the sonic boom at different times.' 

This graphic reveals the effect in action. It takes light about 0.0116 seconds to cross the moon, said Dr Nemiroff, but a person can sweep a laser pointer across the moon's surface in less time

The laser effect is only a trick - but it could reveal hidden details.When the light first hits the object it creates a 'photonic boom'. Comparing this to the sweep of light over the surface could reveal properties of the object it is striking. For example, sweeping light over an asteroid thousands of times could reveal its mass

While the laser beam on the moon analogy might seen simplistic, it is actually relevant to other events in the universe.

Namely, pulsars, rapidly rotating neutron stars, may sweep their own beams across cloud of dust and gas and creating the superluminal effect.

'The photonic boom effect has never yet been identified as such out in the cosmos,' Dr Nemiroff said.

'One reason is that no one has thought to look for it. The research says the effect probably occurs and should be looked for.'

When a superluminal sweep occurs, it is thought to start with a flash known as a 'photonic boom' - so-called because they are analogous to sonic booms and breaking the sound barrier.

The crux of Dr Nemiroff's research is that by comparing these sweeps with the scattering of the beam, characteristics on the origin of the beam - and the object it is striking - can be observed.

For example, to reveal the size and surface features of asteroids passing near Earth, a laser beam could be swept across the rock's surface thousands of times a second.

Each sweep would create a photonic boom and, recorded with high-speed cameras, could map out major features on the asteroid.

A similar phenomenon is observed in pulsars shining on dust clouds (illustration shown). Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of light, and the glow they create on dust clouds has been observed by astronomers. The sweeping motion could appear to travel faster than light, according to Dr Nemiroff

Dr Nemiroff said photonic booms could be observed in the universe, such as in Hubble's Variable Nebula, pictured. Here, he said shadows cast by clouds moving  between a bright star may reflect dust and move so fast that they might create photonics booms visible for days or weeks

The physics that create a photonic boom is tied to the faster-than-light sweep speeds of the illuminating spots and shadows.

Specifically, a flash is seen by an observer when the speed of the scattered spot toward the observer drops from above the speed of light to below the speed of light.

The phenomenon is possible only because the spots contain no mass and so cannot only move faster than light, but decelerate past the speed of light without violating Einstein's theory of special relativity.

The effect hinges on the interplay between the time it takes for a sweeping beam of light to cross an object, and the time it takes for the light beam to traverse the depth of the object.

'Photonic booms happen around us quite frequently - but they are always too brief to notice,' said Dr Nemiroff in a separate press release.

'Out in the cosmos they last long enough to notice - but nobody has thought to look for them!'

When neutrinos leak out of nuclear reactor, they are travelling above the speed of light in water and briefly break the 'light barrier'. As they slow, they release something called Cerenkov radiation, which appears as a blue glow. Pictured is the glow from the Idaho National Laboratory's Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) core

Photonic booms should not be confused with the well-known Cerenkov radiation, which is emitted when an object breaks the speed of light in a particular material.

The speed of light is different in various mediums - for example, it moves slower through water than it does in air.

So, if a particle moving at the speed of the light in air moves into water, it produces the radiation as it slows to below light speed.

This effect can be observed in nuclear reactors, which are kept underwater.
