Wilfried Zaha was happy to take one for the team after the Crystal Palace winger was involved in a nasty collision with the post as he opened the scoring against QPR on Saturday.

The 22-year-old slid in at the back stick to turn home Yannick Bolasie's low cross knowing that he was on course to crash into the upright. 

'I knew Bolasie was going to push it down the line, we've been doing it in training,' Zaha said during his post-match interview on BT Sport.

'I had to get on the end of it, so if it meant colliding with the post, I had to. I was just glad to get the goal. 

'I just got to do the right thing and ice it because it will definitely hurt tomorrow, but no pain, no gain.'

After Palace beat Saturday's opponents 3-1 at Selhurst Park Zaha refused to get carried away as Alan Pardew's side close in on the top half of the table.

Zaha lays on the turf injured after the collision with the upright and later had to be substituted 

'Theres a lot to be done so we'll take every game as it comes. I don't know how high we can go, we're playing well. We've got to keep a steady head.'

James McArthur and Joel Ward added two goals in ninety seconds just before half time as Palace ran riot in the opening 45 before Matt Phillips pulled a goal back for the visitors with a 40-yard stunner in the second half.
