A second female employee at the Washington County Jail in Hillsboro, Oregon, has been accused of having sex with the same inmate — a man held on charges that include failing to register as a sex offender.

Brett Robinson, 32, was arrested Tuesday after a grand jury indicted her on charges of custodial sexual misconduct. She was later released after posting $120,000 bail.

The revelation comes about a month after Washington County Jail employee Jill Curry, 38, was arrested on similar charges.

The Oregonian reported that both women worked as civilian jail service technicians whose duties included booking and control room operations.

The Washington County sheriff's office said it is reviewing jail operations in light of the allegations against its staff.

A spokesman, Sgt. Bob Ray, said Curry and Robinson did not know about one another's contact with the inmate.

The jail holds 572 inmates and has a staff of 180 corrections deputies and civilian workers.

Jill Curry, 38, was arrested July 16 on charges of first-degree custodial misconduct with an inmate.

During her arraignment three weeks later, the long-time jail employee was charged with more than two dozen criminal counts, including identity theft. She pleaded not guilty and is due back in court next Monday, reported Hillsboro Tribune.

The 38-year-old woman has been working within the sheriff's office since October 2004. Curry's indictment stated that the jail staffer had sex numerous time with the inmate in question between May 25 and July 3.

Mrs Curry is married to a sheriff's deputy, who has since filed for divorce.

According to officials, the allegations against Brett Robinson came to light as a result of the Curry investigation. 

‘I consider allegations that involve a second Jail staff member in this case extraordinarily serious,’ said Sheriff Pat Garrett. ‘Addressing these issues demands immediate changes and a thorough, holistic review of protocols within the jail. Both efforts are under way. ‘

Robinson, who has been working at the jail since January 2013, was placed on administrative leave July 30. The following day, she was placed on unpaid leave based on the facts of the case.

The sheriff's office has been tight-lipped about the details of the investigations concerning Curry and Robinson, declining to specify where and under what circumstances the alleged sexual encounters took place.

The name of the inmate at the center of the controversy has not been released, but sheriff's officials revealed that he is facing a slew of charges in connection to four separate cases.

The unidentified suspect, who is listed as a victim in the probes of the two jail employees, is accused of failing to register as a sex offender; tempering with a witness; sexual harassment and second-degree assault.
