Fly-half and captain Katy Mclean looks set to return for England women against Ireland in Paris on Wednesday for the first World Cup semi-final in 20 years between two European teams.

Mclean, 28, capped 71 times, took a heavy knock against Samoa in the opening pool game. After being rested against Spain and benched for England’s 13-13 draw with Canada on Saturday, she is poised to reclaim her place.

Ceri Large did a fine job in her absence but the experienced Mclean will be a key player as England tackle an Irish side still on a massive high after their pool victory over New Zealand. The winners will play France or Canada in the final. 

England expects: Katy Mclean is back in contention at the perfect time as England take on Ireland in the semis
