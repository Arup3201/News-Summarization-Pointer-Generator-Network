For just a moment there, followers of the English game wore a worried countenance. 

For much of 2014, Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald were sliding alarmingly down the world rankings and there were few signs of players of similar calibre ready to step forward to take their place.

Was the English game regressing towards the darkness endured at the start of this millennium, when Westy marched a lonely stride among the world’s top 100?

Andy Sullivan beat former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel in sudden death to win the South African Open

Now, a new year begins with no such anxieties. Not only is there every hope the aforementioned trio will enjoy a revival, there have been pleasing scenes coming out of Africa regarding the next wave.

It was encouraging enough when Yorkshireman Danny Willett managed to hold off the silken swings of the South Africans to win the Sun City Challenge before Christmas.

Then, on Sunday, Midlander Andy Sullivan beat former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel in sudden death to become only the second Englishman after Tommy Horton in 1970 to win the South African Open — after The Open, the oldest trophy in the game.

The scale of these triumphs should not be underplayed. OK, many of the world’s best were not there, but South Africa has so many proven winners who are particularly effective on home soil. This was a spectacular double for the Spaceman (Sullivan) and the Preacher’s Son (Willett).

Sullivan earned his moniker following a hole-in-one last year with its unique prize of a trip into space, while Willett will probably never be able to escape reference to the Dusty Springfield classic given his father is a Church of England vicar.

Completing a quartet of rich, regional accents is the personable 23-year-old Lancastrian Tommy Fleetwood and Matt Fitzpatrick from Sheffield.

Fleetwood begins the three- tournament Desert Swing in the Middle East this week, knowing that if he can clamber into the world’s top 50 — he is currently 52nd — by the end of March, he will join Willett at the Masters in April.

Former US Amateur champion Fitzpatrick, fresh from earning his tour card at the age of just 20, finished in the top five in his first event, the South African Open.

Then from the South, there’s Eddie Pepperell from Oxford and Tyrrell Hatton from High Wycombe, who are both more than capable of achieving their first wins this year.

Plenty of positive vibes for the English game, therefore, at the start of another campaign.

Quote of the week

‘Golf would not be dying if more people played the way we play out here. We’ve just taken two-and-a-half hours, including a 19th hole to settle a tied score. It’s not that hard to do.’

As one keen golfer sets out on the last few holes of his term as US President, another White House wannabe Jeb Bush — son of one former incumbent and brother of another — declares how he likes to play the game. We might not come close to agreement on anything else he believes in, but I think we can surely give him a round of applause on this one.

Tiger Woods set to make his first appearance at the Waste Management Open since 2001

By the time he gets to Phoenix, there will, assuredly, be pandemonium. 

As if the last weekend in January wasn't busy enough for Arizona’s largest city, with the Super Bowl coming to town and the Waste Management Open, which regularly attracts the largest, booziest crowd in the sport — always more than 500,000 spectators for the week — also taking place. 

Now, Tiger Woods has announced he will begin his season with a first appearance in the WMO since 2001. I don’t know who was first to cast eyes on the raucous hordes and wittily proclaim it would be better known as the Wasted Management Open. But I've a feeling it might apply more than ever this year.

Will Sky fall in on The Open? 

Ever since the subject was first raised in these pages three years ago, the possibility of the BBC losing The Open to Sky following nearly 60 years of coverage has rumbled menacingly beneath the surface.

The corporation’s plight was not helped when the Royal and Ancient’s American equivalent, the United States Golf Association, signed away the rights to the US Open to brash newcomer Fox Sports, after decades on NBC.

Now the tendering process is under way, will the R&A cash in as well?

Given their mandate is to look after the best interests of the game, it is to be hoped not.

How can it help golf to take live coverage of its most prestigious competition off terrestrial television,

thereby cutting its viewing figures by three-quarters and depriving curious youngsters of a vital opportunity to watch?

Against that, the BBC are said to be disillusioned. The contract ends next year, and right now it is not easy to see how this is going to end well for the R&A game.
