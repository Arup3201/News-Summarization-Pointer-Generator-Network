The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have delighted well-wishers by sending thank you cards to all of the people who wrote to congratulate them on the birth of Prince George.

Their heartwarming gesture was even extended to the self-appointed ‘town crier’ who fooled the international press when he announced the birth 
outside St Mary’s hospital.

The card, which features a picture of the proud parents with the baby prince on the back, states Catherine and William were 'most touched' that people 'took the trouble' to write to them after the birth of their first son.

Cheeky Tony Appleton took it upon himself to declare the birth of the future king on the steps of the Lido Wing on July 22.

The 76-year-old from Romford amused 
royal fans and film crews when he turned up to make the ‘unofficial’ 
announcement, but many were unaware that Mr Appleton had turned up to 
announce the birth on his own accord.

Another delighted 
Royal fan who received a letter was  Zoe Hall from Brighton, East 
Sussex, who sent a 'Congratulations' card after the birth was announced 
in July.

She said she hadn't expected a reply and was 'thrilled' when the Buckingham Palace stamped enveloped dropped through her letter box.

Store
 manager Miss Hall, 25, said: 'I sent the card the day the birth was 
announced in July and I am amazed I got a reply so quickly.

'I am absolutely thrilled and will definitely be getting it framed.

'I wanted to send a card as I was so excited about the announcement.

'After watching the Royal wedding and seeing their public appearances you start to feel part of their lives.

'It is nice they are recognising people's interest in them.'
