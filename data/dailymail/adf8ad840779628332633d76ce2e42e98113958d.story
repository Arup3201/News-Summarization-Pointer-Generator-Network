When the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Cape Cod in 1620 to start a new colony, they ensured that the name of Plymouth would be immortalised in American history for ever.

But now it has been claimed that their ship, the Mayflower, should not be associated with the city in Devon which it set out from, but with the Essex port town of Harwich.

The ship which transported the enterprising Puritans across the Atlantic was apparently built in Essex, and may have made only a brief stop-over in Plymouth as it began its journey.

The Pilgrim Fathers named their landing place 'Plymouth Rock', meaning that every schoolchild in the U.S. has heard of the city on the south coast of England.

Plymouth is currently gearing up for the 400th anniversary of the fateful landing, which will fall at the end of this decade.

Officials are planning a series of events to celebrate the voyage, and have even invited the future President of the U.S. to attend - seven years in advance.

If the President does decide to go to the festivities in Plymouth, he or she will find the name 'Mayflower' adorning dozens of sites and businesses in the city, including a museum, school and sailing club.

But Harwich, on the east coast, insists that it should be the town remembered as the birthplace of the Mayflower, and residents are planning a rival set of anniversary celebrations.

The ship was described in some port documents as 'The Mayflower of Harwich', and the main builder was a native of Harwich, implying that that is where it was probably built.

Its voyage to the New World seems to have begun in London, where it picked up passengers at the East End docks before travelling on to Southampton and then Plymouth.

The Pilgrims themselves came from a number of different places in Britain, with at least four of them being from Essex, although none seems to have had pre-existing links to Devon.

Campaigners at the Harwich Mayflower Project have launched a Â£2.5million plan to build a life-size replica of the boat and sail it across the Atlantic.

Organiser Andy March told The Times: 'Plymouth has grabbed the limelight but the vessel has much closer ties with Harwich, where she was built.

'It may put Plymouth noses out of joint, but we are determined that everyone should know of Harwich's role.'

Another supporter, John Acton, claimed that Plymouth had 'hijacked the ship and claimed it as their own', pointing out that many of America's early settlers were proud of their East Anglian roots.

He has lodged a legal claim to block any attempt by the Devon city to claim ownership of the Mayflower.

However, while the ship may have started life in Essex, it is unlikely to shake its association with Plymouth any time soon.

A spokesman for Plymouth City Council told The Times: 'The Mayflower departed from Plymouth on September 8, 1620, nearly 400 years ago on its Pilgrim voyage to New England.

'The journey and the vessel are a piece of our country's history and we are proud to celebrate being a part of that.'

Plymouth Colony, founded by the Pilgrim Fathers after they landed in the Mayflower at Cape Cod in November 1620, is one of the best-known American colonies despite not being the first.

Its fame is partly because it was the first community in what would become the U.S. to be founded by Puritans fleeing religious persecution, establishing the New World's reputation as a land of tolerance and freedom.

The Pilgrims were mostly English men, women and children who had been banned from worshipping as they wished thanks to strict laws against all Christian denominations outside the Church of England.

Many had previously fled to Leiden, in the Netherlands, but seized the opportunity to found a new community based on the spirit of religious equality.

They travelled in the Mayflower from London via Plymouth, and made landfall at a spot they called 'Plymouth Rock', founding a colony of settlers nearby.

Despite widespread illness and harsh conditions, the community survived, and in late 1621 held a ceremony which later became known as the origins of the Thanksgiving holiday.

The settlement founded by the Pilgrims has remained continuously occupied for nearly 400 years, and is now the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts.
