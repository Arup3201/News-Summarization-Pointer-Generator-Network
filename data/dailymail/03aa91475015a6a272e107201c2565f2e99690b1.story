Drivers may find themselves without fuel - with petrol pumps across the country running dry - after fuel drivers voted in favour of strikes today.

In a painful reminder of 
the fuel protests of 2000, when truckers blocked the crucial flow of 
fuel to the forecourts, drivers may find themselves stranded following the vote by Unite members to strike.

The 2,000 balloted union members supply fuel to 90 per cent of the nation's garages via seven haulage companies - and a strike could cause 7,900 stations to close.

The fallout of the ballot could see the nation brought to a crippling standstill, with drivers unable to find enough fuel for everyday tasks, and businesses or organisations such as the NHS struggling to function normally.

Memories of 2000 (when fuel cost less than 80p a litre): Cars rushed to the forecourts as tankers struggled to make it to garages

For just over a week in September 2000 the nation came to a virtual standstill as protesters blocked the crucial flow of fuel.

While truckers and farmers blockaded refineries, petrol stations ran dry, tempers soared and panic buying raged.

With the memories of the previous strike still fresh, the Government has announced that soldiers are being lined up to stand in for the tanker drivers if strikes go ahead.

However, Labour leader Ed Miliband has yet to 
condemn the threat of crippling industrial action by Unite, which is one of Labour's biggest donors.

Workers in seven major distribution 
companies - Wincanton, DHL, Hoyer, BP, J W Suckling, Norbert 
Dentressangle and Turners - were balloted for industrial action.

A spokesman for Hoyer, which pays workers an average of £45,000 a year, said Unite walked out of negotiations.

A Hoyer spokesman said: 'We are dismayed at the outcome of the Unite ballot for industrial action involving 650 drivers on our fuels contracts.

The results for the seven companies involved in the ballot are:

'Particularly as only 215 drivers out of the 650 voted for strike action and we therefore believe that this action is being driven by a small disaffected group of employees.

'In our history of delivering petroleum products for large oil companies, Hoyer has not had a major accident or serious injury to a member of our team.

'Pay and conditions for Hoyer drivers are among the best in the industry. Our drivers earn on average £45,000 a year.

'They are well rewarded because they are professionals, highly trained and skilled in the work that they carry out, particularly with regard to health and safety.

'We have been actively engaged in discussions with Unite through the Industry Forum to examine ways in which these high health safety and training stands can be applied across the industry but Unite walked away from those discussions.'

However Unite's general secretary said the union was simply trying to establish 'minimum standards'.

Diana Holland said: 'These votes send a clear message throughout the industry and should prompt all the major companies to get around the table to establish minimum standards.

'This is not about pay - this is about ensuring that high safety and training standards are maintained, so that our communities are safe.

'It is about a simple measure, the creation of an industry-wide bargaining forum. It is about bringing fairness and stability back to an essential national industry.'

The union is led by the militant Len McCluskey, who has also called for strikes to disrupt the Olympics.

Those comments were labelled ‘unacceptable and wrong’ by Mr Miliband - but the Labour leader has not commented on his latest vote.

Unite, the country’s largest trade union, is also the biggest donor to the Labour party, handing over around £3million a year.

It gave £10,000 to Ed Miliband’s leadership election campaign – which only succeeded because of his backing from trade unions.

The Government said it had 'robust resilience and contingency plans' to deal with a strike and had already started to put these in place to minimise any disruption to the public.

Energy Secretary Edward Davey said: 'The Unite ballot result is disappointing.

'The Government is strongly of the view that strike action is wrong and unnecessary. The union should be getting round the negotiating table, not planning to disrupt the lives of millions of people across Britain.

'This is an industrial dispute and we strongly urge Unite to resolve it by getting back to the negotiating table, not by threatening the nation with economic and social disruption.

'Our economy is just getting back on its feet and any action that makes that harder is totally unjustified.

'With the London 2012 Olympics approaching, it is unacceptable and selfish to behave in this manner and jeopardise our international reputation.

'Unite has committed to ensuring that essential services are not disrupted. We trust it will live up to this commitment and not put anyone in harm’s way.

'The Government stands ready to take whatever action we can to minimise the impact of any strike.

'If we have to, we will use emergency powers to make sure supplies for emergency services are prioritised and we will work to ensure trained military personnel are available to drive oil tankers.

'The police will be on hand to ensure that strike action does not intimidate or prevent drivers that wish to work from doing so.

'While their main concerns are pay and conditions, which are matters for their employers, they have also raised health and safety. We take health and safety very seriously and will be looking carefully at what Unite is saying.

'Ensuring people are safe at work is a priority for us and we are committed to resolving any issues around this.

'But we are clear - first and foremost - the parties must get back around the table. There is no justification for this. It’s the wrong action at the wrong time.'

Ministers say the training of Army drivers will begin 
next week.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said the Government had learned from 2000, when many petrol stations ran out of fuel and the NHS was placed on red alert.

He said: ‘We are calling on the trade
union Unite and the employers involved to work together to reach an 
agreement that will avert industrial action.

‘Widespread strike action affecting 
fuel supply at our supermarkets, garages and airports could cause 
disruption across the country.

‘The
general public should not and must not suffer from this dispute, and 
strike action is manifestly not the answer. Although we are pushing for 
an agreement, we have learnt the lessons of the past and stand ready to 
act to minimise disruption to motorists, to industry and, in particular,
to our emergency services.’

The
contingency plans have been drawn up by Mr Maude, Transport Secretary 
Justine Greening, Home Secretary Theresa May, Health Secretary Andrew 
Lansley and Energy Secretary Ed Davey. However, the Petrol Retailers 
Association, which represents about 5,500 forecourts, said it did not 
think the Government was prepared for a strike.

Chairman
Brian Madderson said: ‘We have had no word from the Department of 
Energy and Climate Change whatsoever, so we have not been asking our 
members to keep their stocks at a high level.’

On
its online ballot form, Unite says: ‘While the oil industry rakes in 
multi-billion-pound profits, the drivers who supply fuel to forecourts 
across the country are being squeezed ... the major employers have been 
slashing drivers’ terms and conditions and cutting corners on training 
and safety in a bid to win contracts.’

Tanker drivers earn around £45,000 a year for 37 hours of work a week.
