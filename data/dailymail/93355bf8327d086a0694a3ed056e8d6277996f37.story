As the property market begins to heat up for 2015 the best performing areas of the last year have been revealed, demonstrating the best growth in the last 12 months actually occurred far from the nation's CBDs.

The areas that recorded the best growth in each state and territory around Australia have been detailed in a report by property investment website Hotspotting.

Hotspotting founder Terry Ryder said the top picks for 2014 were based not just on median house price growth but also on sales volume – which points to price growth in 2015.

Western Australia - Busselton

Northern Territory - New Palmerston 

'We prefer sales volume as it's a precursor to future price growth,' he said.

'There's time lag between sale and price growth activity and it can take six to nine months before you can see result of that upturn.'

Mr Ryder said the best growth markets were not 'millionaire suburbs', despite the fact they got much of the attention in 2014.

'Certainly in Sydney and Melbourne the upturn started with those so-called prime suburbs,' Mr Ryder told Daily Mail Australia.

'But by the time we'd got to the second half of 2014 the best growth in those cities was being reported in the middle-ring and outer-ring suburbs.

'It starts in the top-end suburbs then gradually ripples out.'

Mr Ryder said some areas on the list, including Toowomba in Queensland and the Kingborough local government area in Tasmania, would continue to perform well in 2015.

But he warned against using the top picks for 2014 - including Penrith in Sydney and Sunshine in Melbourne – as an indicator of the best growth areas for 2015.

'I think we're going to see different locations showing biggest growth this year,' he said.

'The biggest growth has been had in Sydney and Melbourne, what we're seeing now is the rise of Brisbane.'

Hotspotting included all states and territories on its 2014 list except for the ACT, which Mr Ryder said hadn't shown growth in the last two to three years,

Suburbs in the Brimbank local government area, west of Melbourne CBD, performed much better than the city average of 8 per cent

'It's purely about the Liberal Government downsizing the public service and relocating public servants to regional areas, all of that's had a huge impact.'

He added that the term 'property boom' was used to describe areas that recorded double digit growth. 

NEW SOUTH WALES: PENRITH

The standout suburb was Penrith, 50km west of the Sydney CBD, due to major infrastructure projects planned for the area. Areas near Blacktown and Liverpool also performed well, with most suburbs in the far west recording median price growth between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.

VICTORIA: SUNSHINE

Suburbs in the Brimbank local government area, west of Melbourne CBD, performed much better than the city average of 8 per cent. The median house price for Sunshine, 11km west of the CBD, rose 15 per cent while Braybrook was up 14 per cent.

The top picks for 2014 were based not just on median house price growth but also on sales volume – which points to price growth in 2015

QUEENSLAND: TOOWOOMBA

The regional city of Toowoomba, 127 km west of Brisbane, delivered outstanding growth in 2014 and is tipped to do the same in 2015. This is due to the city's affordablity, good rental yields and planned infrastructure.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA: ONKAPARINGA

The best area in South Australia was the City of Onkaparinga council, 25-40km south of the Adelaide CBD. Hotspotting pointed to its wine district and affordable bayside suburbs, including Seaford and Aldinga Beach, as major drawcards. Sales volumes grew off the back of good population growth.

Sales activity in Tasmania was on the rise in 2014 after two years of little growth. Hobart (pictured is the suburb Mount Nelson) performed particularly well, with the best area being suburbs in the Kingborough local government area in the capital city's south

Rising sales in Kingston, Kingston Beach and Blackmans Bay were expected to drive price growth in 2015

TASMANIA: KINGBOROUGH

Sales activity in Tasmania was on the rise in 2014 after two years of little growth. Hobart performed particularly well, with the best area being suburbs in the Kingborough local government area in the capital city's south. Rising sales in Kingston, Kingston Beach and Blackmans Bay were expected to drive price growth in 2015.

WESTERN AUSTRALIA: BUSSELTON

The best growth markets in WA in 2014 were south of Perth, a departure from the previous trend which saw mining towns perform best. Several suburbs in the City of Busselton, 220 kilometres south west of Perth, recorded double-digit growth in median prices last year.

NORTHERN TERRITORY: NEW PALMERSTON

The growth areas in Darwin were suburbs in the city of Palmerston, 22km south-east of the CBD, based on new construction projects. But this did not translate to price growth.
