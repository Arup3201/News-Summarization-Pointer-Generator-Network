Jo Hughes, 47, had hired Chris Boylan to refurbish her London flat, but was left with a 'nightmare'

As a builder on 60 Minute Make-over, the popular ITV show hosted by Peter Andre, he is known for transforming homes in an hour.

So Chris Boylan seemed the ideal choice when recently widowed mother-of-two Jo Hughes wanted her flat refurbished in record time.

But she claims that what should have been an 11-day job turned into a nightmare lasting almost two months, with Mr Boylan bombarding her with demands for more cash while seemingly doing a shoddy job.

A week into the project, she claimed, tiles had been poorly laid and marble worktops were fitted with uneven joins. Loose wires hung from half-plastered walls in the kitchen, while the junk-filled bathroom was in disarray.

In another room, Mr Boylan and his team had allegedly left drinks bottles and other rubbish on the windowsills. Smashed fragments of tiling lay on the floor, she added.

And that is the state in which Miss Hughes’ home was to remain. Because after three weeks Mr Boylan walked off the job, pocketing the £4,960 she had paid him. It was already £360 more than his original quote.

Yesterday Miss Hughes, 47, of Southfields, South-West London, said she wanted to share her story as a warning to others.

As well as 60 Minute Makeover, Mr Boylan had appeared on Channel 4’s You Deserve This House. He is also listed on the Star Now talent agency as an actor and Elvis impersonator.

But Miss Hughes said he was demanding and careless and unwilling to do the work she was paying him for. She had to pay another £4,000 for a second group of builders to finish the job.

Her husband Mark had recently died from cancer, leaving her alone with their sons Milo, seven, and Oscar, two. 

‘I just wanted to cause the minimum level of upset for my sons,’ she said. ‘It’s been a bloody awful year... I just wanted to make this place nice.’

This is the state that Jo Hughes' living room was left in when Chris Boylan walked off the job in September

Her bathroom (left) had been ripped out and her kitchen (right) was also left in a virtually unusable state

Speaking about the moment Mr Boylan left, she said: ‘That was three weeks into the job. The place was a building site. 

'He hadn’t finished one thing, not one room. There was no bathroom, no kitchen. He’d ripped out the old ones badly, he’d damaged expensive kitchen units and worktop and appliances.’

Miss Hughes has not received any money back from Mr Boylan and plans to take him to the small claims court.

The block of flats where Ms Hughes lives with her two sons in South-West London, where Boylan was to renovate her home

Mr Boylan said yesterday: ‘The figure went up but only because there turned out to be more work.

‘We were driving from Milton Keynes every day. We were leaving the house at 6am and getting home at 6pm, so we were doing a 12-hour day. We don’t take tea breaks, we just crack on.

‘It was initially going to be an 11-day job but we came up with problem after problem after problem and she kept changing her mind about things. And what we’ve done for the money she paid, she’s not out of pocket.’ 

This is how her kitchen looks now, after she paid a second group of builders £4,000 to fix her home

This is how the bathroom looks now with its finished tiling and new bath and sink. Miss Hughes said Boylan was demanding and careless and unwilling to do the work she was paying him for

The toilet has since been finished by other builders. Miss Hughes has not received any money back from Mr Boylan and plans to take him to the small claims court

Not all of the work is finished though - this is how the front room looks as the family work to rectify what has been done

Her two sons - Milo, seven, and Oscar, two - are still sharing a cramped bedroom with boxes everywhere

The master bedroom is being used to store all their belongings while Miss Hughes tries to organise their flat
