Andrew Mitchell was grilled by a committee of MPs

Andrew Mitchell denied acting as a 'rogue minister' yesterday – as he insisted David Cameron had backed his decision to hand £16million in foreign aid to Rwanda.

The former international development secretary has come under fire for lifting the suspension on aid to Rwanda on his final day in office, despite claims its regime is guilty of human rights abuses.

Mr Mitchell – who resigned as Tory chief whip after allegedly calling Downing Street police 'plebs' – had told Mr Cameron that Rwanda had 'ended' its support for the notorious M23 rebels who are leading an uprising in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

In fact, a UN report leaked last month accused Rwanda of masterminding the rebellion which has forced half a million from their homes.

Mr Cameron had made it a condition that support for the M23 rebels ended before aid was restored to the regime of Rwandan President Paul Kagame.

Labour MP Richard Burden, a member of the Commons committee which quizzed Mr Mitchell, said: 'It is not clear to me why Mr Mitchell decided to release this money before the full UN report is out next month.'

Carina Tertsakian, of Human Rights Watch, said it was 'disingenuous' to claim Rwanda's support for the mutiny had ended in the summer.

'Between the end of July when aid was suspended and the start of September when it was reinstated, support for M23 was ongoing,' she said.

Downing Street sources last night insisted Mr Cameron did not feel he had been misled.

Mr Mitchell has developed a close friendship with President Kagame. But yesterday he insisted his decision to restore aid was 'made with complete propriety'.

He said he took 'great offence' at media portrayals of him as a 'rogue minister who signed cheques under the bedclothes and bunged them to dubious regimes'.

Half of the £16million payment to Rwanda went straight into the Kagame regime's coffers.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening will decide whether to press ahead with a further £21million in Rwandan aid after the UN report is published.
