Having started at the top of the diamond, Angel di Maria finished the game on the left wing. In truth, his contributions were limited in both positions but the tactical switch brought the consolation of a quick exit.

Di Maria was well placed to dart straight down the tunnel, with a dark look on his face which failed to reflect the relief that Manchester United had rescued a late point from a game they seemed set to lose.

He was almost off the pitch when he twisted his upper body towards the United fans in a distant corner of the ground and offered them some over-the-shoulder applause, but he did not allow the after-thought to interrupt his stride.

Di Maria had a difficult afternoon, and not a lot went right for the Argentine playmaker

English football’s most expensive signing could not get off fast enough. Mind you, he wasn’t alone. Only Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Daley Blind and Phil Jones took the trouble to trudge over to the supporters.

Again, not a lot had gone right for Di Maria during 90 minutes best summed up by one moment, 13 minutes into the second half when Blind, searching for a long pass to the United right, crashed the ball into the £60million Argentine, who was just a yard or two away. It was not Blind’s most stylish offering and he shrugged an apology as he digested the contents of a filthy glare from Di Maria, who could have done without another pain in the backside.

It had not been a good few days. Perhaps the horror of the robbery at his home was still playing tricks on his mind. It has not been a great first campaign in English football. Eight months have ticked by since he was the man of the match in Real Madrid’s Champions League final success.

He has not played in the competition since, and might start to wonder if he will be back in it next season. United are fighting in the pack behind Chelsea and Manchester City. It is going to be close if they continue to follow each sign of progress with a backward step.

Di Maria is finding it difficult to influence games as he did when he first arrived from Real Madrid. It is four months since his last goal in the Barclays Premier League, although he got one at Yeovil in the FA Cup.

At West Ham, flashes of promise were swallowed up by the peculiarities of Louis van Gaal’s system, seemingly designed to cram as many creative players as possible into the team, but rarely in their preferred positions.

They lacked pace, width and aggression and were easily neutralised by the midfield endeavour of Mark Noble and the defensive strength of James Tomkins and Cheikhou Kouyate.

Di Maria’s most significant offerings were a fierce drive into the arms of Adrian in the first half, and a free-kick whipped over the bar in the second. In open play, he struggled in a side where the attackers are playing without fluency.

While David de Gea made saves and Jones defended well, no one dazzled in Van Gaal’s front five until the introduction of Marouane Fellaini added some useful muscle.

Radamel Falcao and Van Persie were both guilty of missing clear chances as United searched for the equaliser.

Like Di Maria, Adnan Januzaj and Rooney seemed lost on the edges of the diamond. Rooney operated in areas of the pitch where he had little positive impact on proceedings, having defended poorly on Kouyate’s opener.

Rooney memorably scored from halfway at Upton Park last season. This time United can cherish their point and little else by way of satisfaction.
