An advert for a travel company, which tells the story of a father crossing the country after learning to accept his daughter's same-sex marriage, has led to a storm of controversy online.

The Expedia advert, which shows a father making a journey across the U.S., has racked up more than a million hits on YouTube.

But, while some commentators applaud the travel firm for the 'beautiful' and 'touching' clip - entitled Find Your Understanding - others have slammed the firm for portraying an 'abnormal' and 'sexually deviant' relationship.

Mixed reaction: The Expedia advert, featuring a lesbian wedding, attracted both positive and negative comments online

Some angry viewers even said they would no longer use the travel site after Expedia posted the advert on its Facebook page last week.

A comment posted by Jean Chan said: 'You can all try to spread this wickedness but God said it is SINFUL and worthy of eternal damnation!!'

Another user, Reggan Simmons, wrote: 'Glad I was able to see this, I book all the business trips for our office and will no longer be using Expedia. This commercial is unrealistic and denies the real turmoil a family experiences with the issue of homosexuality.'

But Diego Samede on YouTube simply countered with: 'Amazing, so beautiful. All we need is love.'

Offended viewer Olatunji Mwamba described the advert as 'sexually degenerate', 'sexually deviant', and 'anti-life', while a comment posted under the names SandyandDale Hicks read: 'It says in the Bible there will come a time when we must pick God over our families. He could still love his daughter, without tolerating her sin.'

Many comments posted on the clip on 
YouTube have been removed after receiving negative votes from other 
visitors to the video sharing website.

A description of the Expedia advert posted by the firm reads: 'Every trip is unique. On this trip, Artie Goldstein travels across the country to attend his daughter's same-sex wedding, a journey that will test him, challenge him, and ultimately change him in unexpected ways.'

The three-minute clip shows Mr Goldstein and his wife travelling to the ceremony, as he explains in a voice-over how he was initially concerned about his daughter's life choices, but eventually came to accept her sexuality and rejoice in her happiness.

Brides: While some viewers reacted angrily to the advert, others described it as 'beautiful' and 'heart-warming'

While footage of the two radiant brides at their wedding reception created an angry reaction among some viewers, the clip also attracted thousands of positive comments from others - many of whom said the advert had reduced them to tears.

Donna Brooks posted on Facebook: 'That was really beautiful!! Thanks, Expedia, for supporting marriage equality.'

Another user, Jim Woodward, wrote: 'Wow! Hard to type this with the tears in my eyes. My wish for everyone in this situation has parents that are just as wonderful as these parents were. And my best to the newlyweds.'

Facebook reaction: Many comments vowed to snup Expedia, while other quoted from the Bible on immorality

positive experience: Many other viewers praised Expedia for its campaign, which they say was moving
