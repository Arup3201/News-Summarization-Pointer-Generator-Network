Many of us, at some point, will have noticed a moment at home when the lights go dim for a split-second.

We might, suspecting that our eyes are playing tricks, ask someone else whether they saw it, too. When they confirm that they have, we’re grateful that we haven’t imagined things, and then get on with our evening.

But imagine if the lights went dim and then stayed like that for several hours — or perhaps even several days. That would certainly be something to worry about.

Such events are called ‘brown-outs’, because they are one step short of a full black-out. They occur when the voltage to a home or office — the amount of electrical energy being supplied — drops below its normal level.

Although brown-outs are a regular occurrence in the U.S., where electrical infrastructure is creaking, they are almost unheard of in this country. Indeed, the term itself will be unfamiliar to many.

However, this winter it is highly likely that we shall come to know the term all too well. Brown-outs are set to become a frequent and unwelcome feature of our lives. 

Although brown-outs may seem innocuous at first, they are in fact potentially extremely damaging to electronic equipment such as computers, set-top boxes, wireless routers and even many digital clocks found on household appliances such as ovens.

What makes things more worrying is that the brown-outs, if they do happen, will be deliberately brought about by the National Grid.

But why would it do something so damaging? And what can we as consumers do to protect ourselves from the consequences?

The answer to the first question lies in the simple fact that Britain’s power supplies are almost completely over-stretched. So much so that this week the Energy Secretary Ed Davey — who has been forced to deny that blackouts are looming — will unveil a package of contingency measures to reduce pressures on the National Grid this winter.

They include paying hotels to turn down refrigerators, and paying companies to change shifts for staff to make the most efficient use of energy.

This extraordinary situation — Britain once had the most reliable electricity supply in the world — is thanks to a medley of mishaps across Britain’s power stations.

The most recent was certainly dramatic. Last weekend, there was a fire at the Didcot B gas-powered power station near Oxford.

Although the blaze could have been a lot worse — 25 fire engines fought the flames — it did succeed in destroying a unit that supplies power to half-a-million households. That is not something which can be quickly replaced.

By itself, the fire at Didcot would not have severely dented the nation’s power supply, but there are already four other power stations out of action because of various fires and faults.

Together, the five stations that are closed would normally generate a massive 4.3 gigawatts of power, or 7 per cent of the UK’s total electricity capacity.

In relative terms, that percentage may not seem that large, but that capacity does need to be found from somewhere else, especially as winter approaches.

What’s more, demand for electricity shot up this weekend, when the clocks went back to GMT, which means a greater demand for street lighting in the late afternoons.

According to some experts, that means the National Grid may well find it hard to cope, as it now has so little capacity in reserve. In summer, there is usually enough energy in reserve to cope with any problems, but in the winter, services are stretched to capacity.

Peter Atherton, an industry expert, has said: ‘We still have enough capacity to meet demand — provided that nothing else goes down and that we don’t have a cold winter. So much depends on the weather.’

If this winter is, indeed, cold — and the long-range forecast suggests that December might be colder than average — then the National Grid could be in trouble, especially if another one or two power stations suffer from mishaps.

Mr Atherton says that normally he would put the odds of an event happening that threatens the security of supply at about one in 20. ‘A week ago I would have said one in four and now I’d say one in three.’

If the National Grid struggles to meet demand, then — as Ed Davey will make clear — businesses are first obliged to cut down on their energy usage, by doing basic things such as turning off office lights at night, cutting back on air-conditioning use or running heavy-duty machinery only when necessary.

In order to create an incentive, the Government believes it will have to pay firms to reduce their demand.

However, if Davey’s plans are not enough, the National Grid will be forced to reduce the amount of electrical power, or volts, going to our homes. This will result in brown-outs, which are considered to be far less disruptive than full black-outs.

As a result, a reduced voltage entering into our homes may play havoc with many of our home technology appliances.

The reasons for this are a little technical, but in layman’s terms, many devices such as set-top boxes and computers, when faced with a diminution of power, will need to draw more current — the rate of flow of electricity, which is measured in amps — in order to compensate.

Drawing more current confuses the internal ‘organs’ of computerised devices, and can cause them not only to become less efficient and slower, but also to break down.

With so many of us using and relying on such devices, it’s clear that regular brown-outs could not only make our lives more miserable but also severely affect the country’s economy.

So how can we protect ourselves?

First, if you notice the lights getting dim, turn off and unplug all devices such as computers, set-top boxes, and appliances that have digital clocks.

Although TVs are built to be less sensitive to voltage changes, it is worth playing it safe and switching them off, too, to ensure they are not damaged.

Brown-outs can also damage mini-motors, such as those in fridges. Although most are hardy enough to deal with very short brown-outs of, say, a few minutes, many might struggle over longer periods. If you can turn the appliance off, then consider doing so.

However, if you cannot bear to turn some devices off or need them because you are working from home, then you should invest in some form of generator.

Petrol generators can cost several hundred pounds, although a cheaper option would be to invest in a unit called an ‘uninterruptible power supply’, which will protect devices such as computers and set-top boxes from a fluctuating voltage.

Such units are available from many retailers such as Maplin, and they are essentially large batteries that ‘kick in’ when the unit senses that the voltage is diminishing, spiking, or cutting out altogether.

Some of the cheaper models cost around £80, and will provide enough power to keep your computer running for around 15 minutes — plenty of time to save your data and anything you are working on.

The more expensive models can cost many hundreds of pounds or more, but may be worth the investment if you do work from home.

Meanwhile, Ed Davey is doing his best to ensure that we do not panic. A spokesman for his Department of Energy and Climate Change declared: ‘The lights will not go out this winter.

‘Up and down the country there are power stations on stand-by that can start pumping out power when needed, and the Government has given the National Grid extra powers it needs to ensure there is enough electricity to keep the lights on.’

Even if the lights do stay on, we may find them dimmed by a brown-out. Of course, the lights may stay on, but they may go ‘brown’. If that does happen, then it is best to be prepared.
