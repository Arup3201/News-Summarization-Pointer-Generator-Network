Tory MP Nadine Dorries said English MPs should be given more power over English matters

David Cameron is facing growing calls to ban Scottish MPs from voting on laws which only affect England if the country votes to reject independence on Thursday.

Former cabinet minister John Redwood said the House of Commons should sit as an ‘English Parliament’ for most of the week and only let Scottish MPs attend when discussing ‘union’ issues like foreign policy and defence.

Outspoken backbencher Nadine Dorries went further, saying: 'Why are we paying them to eat deep-fried mars bars when we can't even get decent health care in this country?'

Conservative MPs are concerned that in the wake of a ‘No’ vote on Thursday, the Scottish Parliament will be given sweeping new powers over tax and welfare but MPs from north of the border will still be able to vote on matters which only apply in England.

Mr Redwood said Scottish Labour MPs should pledge not to vote on English matters after the independence referendum.

Mr Redwood said: ‘As a Scottish parliament is going to have the power to fix income tax in Scotland we need an English parliament to fix the level of income tax in England.

‘I want England to get the same devolution as Scotland and I want England to get the government it votes for.

‘In 2010 we voted for a Conservative government in England and Scottish MPs gave us a coalition. You have to form the English parliament from the English MPs.

‘I want them to meet as an English parliament and have our own English ministers on English issues just as the Scottish parliament meets, but believing in economy I believe I can do both jobs with my colleagues as we do at the moment.’

Mr Redwood said some policy areas, such as foreign affairs, would still be under the remit of a Union parliament.

‘I am asking for justice and balance. I wish Scotland every success with her vote. If she votes to stay in, as I hope she does, she will get more devolved powers, that’s fine by me.

‘I just ask that England gets exactly the same and we are not going to be fobbed off with breaking up and Balkanising our country.

‘We want an English parliament to settle English income tax to match the Scottish parliament settling Scottish income tax.’

But Scottish Labour MP Dame Anne Begg warned against ‘ad-hoc’ changes to the constitution in the wake of this week’s poll.

She said additional powers for English MPs needed to be considered as part of a ‘coherent approach’ alongside more devolution for Scotland and Wales.

She said: 'We’re [Scottish MPs] not going to have our extra powers immediately so I think it has to be part of that broader discussion.’

She questioned the plan set out by Mr Redwood. Dame Anne said: ‘I think the trouble with John’s proposal is he anticipates turning what I think of as the UK Parliament into an English Parliament.

‘I think that’s important, that there has to be a UK Parliament in order to do all the things that you just mentioned – the foreign affairs, defence and things like that.

‘I think that from John’s point of view and indeed the people who feel that there’s a democratic deficit with regard to England should actually look at the way that we’ve done it in Scotland, which is through constitutional conventions and building a broader consensus.

‘I have to say, we’re four days away from knowing the result of the referendum. I think the timing of this is not the best.

‘I would much rather we were putting our energies into making sure Scotland did remain part of the Union because the decision will be different on Friday, depending on what the outcome of the referendum is.’
