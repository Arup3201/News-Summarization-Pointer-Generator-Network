The release of a new Hollywood comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean despot Kim Jong Un would be an 'act of war', one of his officials warned today.

The U.S. faces 'stern' and 'merciless' retaliation if it fails to block the release of the film, said an unidentified spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry.

He didn't mention the movie by name but was clearly referring to 'The Interview', which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco and will open in U.S. cinemas in October.

The film tells the farcical story of a talk-show host and his producer who land an exclusive interview with Kim, and are then asked by the CIA to assassinate him.

The 'reckless U.S. provocative insanity' of mobilising a 'gangster filmmaker' to challenge the North's leadership is triggering 'a gust of hatred and rage' among North Korean people and soldiers, the spokesman said.

The film's release would be considered an 'act of war that we will never tolerate,' he said in remarks cited by North Korean state media.

The threat came after North Korean agricultural workers held a rally in Nampho, south of Pyongyang, yesterday to vow to take revenge on the United States.

The rally was held one day before the anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War.

Thousands of workers stood in formation holding their right hands in a fist as they protested America's involvement in the three-year bloodbath, which began on June 25, 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea with weapons supplied by the Soviet Union.

Today marks the 64th anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War in which more than 1.2million soldiers died on all sides. Memories of that war are particularly painful in the North, where several cities, including Pyongyang, were all but destroyed by U.S. airpower.

In Seoul, South Korean and American war veterans came together during a ceremony to commemorate the fighting.

Meanwhile, an undated picture was released on Wednesday by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling North Korean Workers Party, showing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visiting a construction site of an orphanage in Pyongyang.

The leader is seen cackling in the images.

A spokesman for Kim had earlier criticised The Interview, in which North Korea's Dear Leader is played by American born Korean 
actor Randall Park.

In the film's trailer, a
secret agent played by Lizzy Caplan says Kim must be stopped as his 
people believe anything he says including 'that he speaks to dolphins 
and doesn't pee or poo.'

Kim 
Myong-chol, executive director of The Centre for North Korea-US Peace and an unofficial spokesman for Pyongyang, dismissed
 the movie. He told the Telegraph its assassination plot represents America's desperate foreign policy as a whole.

Kim Myong-chol
 told the paper: 'There is a special irony in this storyline as it shows
 the desperation of the US government and American society.

'A
 film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the U.S. 
has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. And let us not forget 
who killed [President John F.] Kennedy â€“ Americans.'

International incident: James Franco and Seth Rogen's latest feature, The Interview, depicts the pair trying to kill the country's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un - and North Korea is not amused

Special access: James and Seth play talk show host and producer that have been chosen to interview the leader

The spokesman said America's history of backing political assassinations should be a concern to Barack Obama.

'In fact, President Obama should be careful in case the US military wants to kill him as well.'

As for Rogen and Franco, while the Supreme leader may check out their film, it will never hold up compared to British films which the spokesman said were far better and realistic.

Myong-chol said: 'James Bond is a good character and those films are much more enjoyable.'

His love for Bond films is a little ironic considering in Die Another Day the spy is imprisoned and tortured in North Korea.

North Korea, which has no independent press, often holds foreign governments responsible for the content of their media.

Pyongyang regularly warns Seoul to prevent conservative papers from mocking or criticising its leadership, something banned within authoritarian North Korea, where the Kim family is revered.

It is not the first time a Hollywood comedy lampooned a North Korean leader.

Kim's late father Kim Jong-il was also targeted for assassination by the puppets of Team America.

In that film, the leader is killed only to reveal that an alien cockroach was living inside his body and it survives and flies off on a rocket ship.
