It's the TV show that's taken the nation by storm, as much for its action packed fight scenes and historical storytelling, as its hunky lead actors including former Calvin Klein model Travis Fimmel.

But while audiences are swooning over History channel's shirtless, shield-wielding stars, the Australian model-turned-actor says he doesn't think the show's sexiness has been crucial to its success.

The actor instead credits the TV series' loyal following to good quality scripts, story lines and lovable characters.

Australian Travis confesses that before filming Vikings he knew little about the true history, but thanks to the 'informative' and detailed scripts written by Michael Hirst, he has learned a lot more about European history

Travis first shot to fame in 2002 as the face of Calvin Klein's famous men's underwear range. His billboard posters were said to have caused traffic pile-ups in America, while the then 23-year-old became the first male model to be signed exclusively by Calvin Klein for an entire year, earning him a six-figure sum

Talking to MailOnline, Travis, who shot to fame as the face of Calvin Klein's lauded men's underwear range in 2002, said it was both the pilot episode and historically accurate scripts that first piqued his interest in Vikings.

He said: '[Writer] Michael Hirst is a very talented guy and I wanted to work with him.

'I didn’t know that much about it, I knew as much as anybody else that the Vikings raped and pillaged, but Michael’s writing, you can’t help but learn from it.'

The star did admit however, that historical fact alone isn't always enough to capture the  full attention of today's audience.

Former Australian model Travis Fimmel has won over viewers as legendary viking leader Ragnar Lothbrok, the star of History channel's action-packed historical drama series Vikings, which is now in its third series

Despite claiming to not care for the sexier elements of the show, Travis has won himself a legion of loyal admirers for his portrayal of farm-hand turned viking warrior king Ragnar Lothbrok

From the non-stop raunch of Game of Thrones to the topless Aidan Turner scenes in BBC's new period drama remake of Poldark, there's no denying today's batch of historically based shows are reeling in viewers by upping the sex factor. 

But Travis, who plays Ragnar Lothbrok, the main character in the action-packed  programme, insists there's more to Vikings than just bare brawn.

He said: 'I guess for some people maybe it has to [be sexy], but we’re making an adventure out of it and it's exciting for the audience - and it’s very informative.

On-screen brothers Travis (pictured right) and Clive Standen (pictured left as Vikings character Rollo) have helped to revolutionise the reputation of historical television shows and period dramas

Once thought to be slow and staid, there's now a new breed of period drama packed with action, violence, drama, sex and heartthrobs, breathing new life into the telling of stories steeped in true historical fact

'It’s hard to make people want to learn I guess, but Michael’s done a great job of making a good story out it and the family saga.'

Previously known for his long hair, perfectly groomed appearance, six-pack and bulging underpants, the actor even told us he's past caring what he looks like onscreen.

'I don’t give a s*** about that. We’ve got a whole team to make us look good.' 

Once known for his six-pack and bulging Calvin Klein underpants, Travis Fimmel says he no longer cares what he looks like onscreen, championing the brilliant Vikings script over the show's flesh flashing

For Travis, the real challenge of his role, which is based on the life of historical figure and renowned viking Ragnar Lothbrok, a ruler named in sagas and Old Norse poetry, was endearing his ruthless character to the viewers.

He said: 'I sort of respect him you know, a person who started in the farm and became a king, and a well known figure in history, it’s pretty amazing what Ragnar achieved.

'But we do some heinous things, so it’s a lot of work to make the audience still follow you even though you have done some pretty horrible stuff.'

New series Outlander begins next month, set in Scotland after the Second World War and based on the best-selling books by American writer Diana Gabaldon. While early reviews suggest there will be far less nudity than Game Of Thrones, it's set to feature plenty of drama and some stirring romance 

But while Vikings is currently airing its second series on History channel, there's yet another new drama spicing up the history pages.

Outlander launches 26 March on Nextflix rival service Amazon Prime Instant Video, taking its cue from Game Of Thrones by mixing action and epic fantasy with brooding characters and sexual tension.

Can it rival the current offering? Between's Adian Turner's naked Poldark scenes, the bulging biceps of Vikings and the soon to start fifth season of HBO's Game Of Thrones, there's a lot of hot history to contend with! 

Vikings, Series 2 is on HISTORY tomorrow at 10pm

BBC's new TV period drama Poldark, a remake of the 1970s hit television show, has been accused of flaunting male lead Aidan Turner in topless promotional shots and nude scenes to lure in more viewers

HBO's medieval fantasy epic Game Of Thrones features adult scenes plus both partial and full-frontal nudity in almost every episode, making it one of the raunchiest box-sets on Sky

Roast boar might have been the Vikings' party food of choice but venison was almost as popular, as Jesper's delicious recipe proves. Here's how cooking like a Viking is done:

VENISON WITH MEAD AND MUSHROOMS

One venison filet

Four slices of mature ham or good bacon

250g butter

Handful of fresh mushrooms

300ml cream

200ml mead

Check the fillet for tendons and remove. Cut the meat into four pieces and wrap each one in a slice of ham, fixing it in place with a tooth pick.

Clean the mushrooms and slice or chop them. Next, brown 50g butter in a frying pan, then add the meat and cook to medium. Remove from the pan and cover with a paper towel and leave to rest while you make the gravy.

Place 100g of butter in your pan and let it brown. Fry your mushroom until they take on some colour. Next, add the mead and let it reduce by a third before adding the cream. Reduce again by two thirds, before removing the pan from the heat and stirring in the rest of the butter.

Serve the meat in the pan and grin along with the Norse gods as you enjoy it.

BAKED BABY BEETROOTS 

1kg baby beetroots

100g butter

100g honey

Peel the beetroots and dry them. Melt the butter and honey in a frying pan, then add the beetroots, covering them completely in the mixture.

Bake the beetroots for approximately 45 minutes at 175 degrees. Check and turn the beetroots regularly.

SWEETHEART CABBAGE SALAD

400g sweetheart cabbage

Eight baby leeks or  one large one

One pear

A dash of apple cider vinegar

Small handful of blackberries and blueberries

3tbsp rapeseed oil

Sprinkling of chopped parsley

Salt and pepper to taste

Cut the sweetheart cabbage into 5mm slices and place in a large serving bowl. 

Cut the pear into thin slices, add the parsley and drizzle both with apple cider vinegar before throwing all of it over the cabbage with the blackberries and blueberries.

Fry the leek in rapeseed oil with a pinch of salt until the edges turn brown and add to the salad as a topping

All dishes serve four
