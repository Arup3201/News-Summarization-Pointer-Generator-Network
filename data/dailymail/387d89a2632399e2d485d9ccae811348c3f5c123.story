A turtle in a hamburger, tadpoles inside the mouth and a corpse all rank among the top five weirdest items passengers have tried to smuggle on to planes.

The bizarre list, compiled by Jetcost, also reveals a man attempted to board a plane in Miami for Brazil with bags full of exotic snakes – and reptiles in his pants.

Rather than trying to get through security with liquids more than 100ml in volume, it seems some passengers are hell-bent on getting their money’s worth when it comes to hand luggage.

Cunning disguise: A man attempted to smuggle guns inside his son's soft toys - including a Mickey Mouse bear

Security alert: A woman tried to smuggle tadpoles through Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in China

1. A turtle in a hamburger.2. A weapon and ammunition in his son's stuffed toys3. Tadpoles inside the mouth4. Seven snakes and three turtles in his pants5. A corpse in a wheelchair pretending to be a passenger

Scooping first place on the list is a man identified as Mr Li who tried to board a flight to Beijing from China's Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in 2013.

Security workers noticed ‘strange bulges’ in his luggage as it passed through X-ray machines. Upon finding a turtle hidden in a burger, Mr Li told them: ‘This is not a turtle, but just a hamburger.‘There is nothing to see.’

Second place goes to American father who attempted to smuggle weapons and ammunition in his son’s stuffed toys – including a Mickey Mouse bear.

The security officers made the find at 
the boarding area in Rhode Island T.F. Green airport in 2012.

But, after
 speaking to the man, he and his four-year-old son were allowed to fly 
to Detroit as it was deemed he posed no threat.

Something fishy... A woman attempted to smuggle tadpoles on to a plane by carrying them in her mouth

In third place, a South Korean woman was put under arrest in the Guangzhou Chinese airport when she tried to pass through security checks with her mouth full of tadpoles last year. 

The woman was seem trying to board the plane with a bottle of liquid. She was given the option to drink it or throw it – and she chose the first option – but officials noticed she didn’t swallow it.

After ordering her to spit out the contents of her mouth, revealing the tadpoles, which she said had been given to her by a friend and she didn’t want to lose them.

Seven 
snakes on a plane make it into fourth place after a man tried to board a
 plane in Miami for Brazil with the reptiles – including turtles - 
hidden in his pants. 

The
 Transportation Security Administration spokesman, Jonathon Allen, said 
the creatures were confiscated at the time of the attempt in 2011.

Snakes on a plane! A man attempted to carry seven snakes and three turtles on to a plane

Making up the top five are the two women who tried to board a plane at Liverpool John Lennon airport – pretended a relative’s corpse in a wheelchair was a passenger.

The two German women were arrested in 2010 for ‘failing to give notification of the death ’of a 91-years-old man, with whom they were trying to travel to Berlin – by covering his eyes with sunglasses and pretending he was asleep. 

A spokesman for Jetcost said: ‘Undoubtedly most flight passengers have experienced airport security controls and have been forced to leave behind small bottles of water, nail clippers or even cheese, just for being too creamy. 

‘On the other hand, less innocent objects have tried to pass the inspection and on occasion even succeeded.’
