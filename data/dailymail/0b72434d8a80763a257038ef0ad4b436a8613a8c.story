FDNY firefighters make it their job to put out fires, but their heroic feats also inspire fires in the hearts of their fans - so called firefighter 'buffs.'

According to a story in today's New York Post, one such buff, 34-year-old Christine Cuocolo has been practically stalking two Midtown engine companies.

Cuocolo is a divorced mother of three who works at the IRS. Her fascination with Engine Co. 26 and Engine Co. 65 started off innocently enough. She was a member of several online support groups dedicated to the FDNY. Support FDNY, FDNY Midtown, and NYC Fire Wire - all on Facebook - are examples of the kind of firefighter support pages Cuocolo would frequent.

But Cuocolo started to worry the firefighters when she showed up at the firehouses with baked goods, memorial plaques and flowers - something that is not allowed. Visitors are only allowed inside the firehouses during open houses.

'Some mistake our niceness for something more than it is,' one firefighter told the Post. 'Some people don't realize it's a job. They think it's our job to entertain them. These people are interfering.'

He said that popular TV shows such as 'Rescue Me' and 'Backdraft' paint a false image of what firehouse life is really like - with private affairs happening inside the firehouse itself.

Cuocolo seems to be one of those people. Cuocolo told the Post she would bring plates of cookies to 'show support because I respect them.'

Her aim was to catch the eye of one of the firemen, acknowledging that she had crushes on a few men at Engine 65.

Crush: Cuocolo admitted wanting to date a few of the men at Engine 65. She is a divorced mother of three

'Yeah I did at one time. It was a couple [firefighters]. I don't remember who right now,' Cuocolo said.

When firefighters told her she had to stop showing up at the house, Cuocolo got nasty. She posted pictures of firefighters' families online and sent text messages to other buffs talking smack about specific firefighters.'Im so sick of 65 house and tommy danny chris i want to shove a halligan up each of there asses,' she wrote in one text message to fellow buss Joni Heiden, who administers a few buff Facebook pages. A halligan is a tool firefighters use to pry open doors.

A January 2 post on the NYPD Chicky page showed an image of a Engine 65  truck with the letters 'F U' seemingly Photoshopped on the windshield.

Rebuffed: When Cuocolo was told to stop showing up at the firehouse, she didn't react too well. A picture was posted on the FDNY Chicky page on January 2 with the letters ' F U' scrawled on the windshield of a Engine 65 truck

The situation drew the attention of the NYPD and State Police when Engine 65 was threatened.

On April 23 a post was put up on Indiana buff Scott Main's Facebook page which read: 'i enjoy threating firefighter lifes the most import is i take out every fdny firefighter im going to start with 65 house.' A 'pipe bomb' was mentioned in another post.

No badge bunnies allowed: A recent post on the FDNY Midtown Facebook page proposed a crack-down on any other 'badge bunnies.' The FDNY and NYPD asked several of the groups to take Cuocolo off their pages

Main was a former boyfriend of Cuocolo's, but their relationship ended badly when she found out he wasn't an actual firefighter.

'He had the gear to prove it,' Cuocolo said. There are even pictures of her posing in firefighter clothing. But apparently, Main just grabbed them from a dumpster.

'He pretended to be a firefighter. He never was one.'

When they broke-up, Cuocolo gave his Facebook login information to Gary Battista, another buff, who wanted to get back at Main for allegedly beating Cuocolo.

Battista was charged last month with making terroristic threats and computer trespass. He admitted to hacking Main's facebook page and spent one month in upstate Monroe County Jail.  Cuocolo admitted that she gave Battista Main's login information, but says she didn't know about the threatening post.

Cuocolo is no longer allowed at the firehouses. Most of the men just feel bad for her.

'I think she's just a person who needs come help. She is not very mature and is easily manipulated,' one firefighter said.
