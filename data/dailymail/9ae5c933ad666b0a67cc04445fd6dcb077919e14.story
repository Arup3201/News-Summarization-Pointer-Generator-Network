The stepfather of a teenager who has been missing for 20 days has been taken into police custody amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter.

Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2 and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell, 36, was taken into custody on Saturday after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours.

Wesley has been locked up on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering.

Speaking from the Norfolk City Jail, Wesley said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will.

'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com.

Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger.

While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket.

'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said.

'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.'

Wesley is currently being held without bond and the Norfolk Police Department are not currently refering to him as a person of interest or a suspect in AJ's disappearance.

Officially the cops have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects.

During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition.

He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. 

In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states.

On Saturday he told WAVY that he is a changed man. 'I want my daughter home,' he said. 

'That's what I want and that's all I want. Anybody who wants to say something about that or get in the way of that, then I'm sorry. So what some ways are unorthodox. I didn't have anything to do with her disappearance. I don't know where she's at.'

Police on Saturday spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road

Police on Saturday spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road.

AJ's family and friends had started searching the area around 5 p.m. on Friday and found at least four items they believe belonged to her. Forensics teams spent Saturday collecting evidence in brown paper bags.

Hadsell is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.

A Longwood University freshman, she was home for spring break and was last seen by a neighbor driving her car towards her parents' home on March 2 in Norfolk, Virginia.

A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her.

They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time.
