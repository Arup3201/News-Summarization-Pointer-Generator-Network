The resting place of Australia's first submarine may have been found off the coast of Papua New Guinea.

HMAS AE1 was lost at sea in September 1914 along with its 34 crew members and last made contact off the coast of the Duke of York Island - an eastern island of the nation.

Retired Rear Admiral Peter Briggs told news.com.au a wreckage resembling that of the missing submarine had been found close to where it had been seen before it disappeared near Rabaul.

Since the AE1 vanished, many searches have been mounted to find it but without any success, according to the Navy website.

The most recent search was done in September with Navy Mine Hunter HMAS Yarra scouring the ocean floors near Mioko Harbour.

On the last day of the hunt for the missing ship, the Yarra's sonar detector picked up a cylindrical shape but just before physical exploration could be conducted its equipment broke down.

Admiral Briggs said the search crew on the Yarra were positive the find, Y1, was not a rock face jutting out from the ocean floor.

Y1 is more than 50 metres long, cuts a submarine-like figure and was found sitting upright in waters that were 170 metres deep, which would make further exploration easier as the area was shallow.

The dimensions of the AE1 were 55.17 metres long, 6.86 metres in width and 6.86 metres high from its keel to the top of the coning tower.

'There are no known shipwrecks in the area where the sounding was made,' Admiral Briggs told News Corp.

'The object is likely something man-made due to its sonar signature. It is also located well away from Rabaul Harbour and its WW2 wrecks.'

AE1 Incorporated is a not-for-profit organisation aiming at finding the lost submarine.

The group's webmaster, James Palmer, told Daily Mail Australia they were trying to lobby the federal government for funding to conduct further searches, which could happen as early as next year.

'We're not 100 per cent certain it is the AE1... there needs to be more analysis done,' he said.

'But it is a great step forward... a really brilliant lead.'

Mr Palmer said the upright position of the cylindrical object indicated if it had sunk almost immediately.

'It is thought she [AE1] was making her way home and struck unchartered reef... and it opened the side of her hull or keel and took on water very quickly,' he said.
