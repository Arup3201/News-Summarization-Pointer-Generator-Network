A teenage gang is being hunted by police after beating up a disabled grandmother and then urinating on her in the street.

Denise Bright, 58, who walks with the aid of a stick, was attacked as she walked home alone from her local shops in Norwich.

The grandmother-of-eight cowered on the ground as she was repeatedly kicked in the head, verbally abused and urinated on by the thugs.

Victim: Denise Bright, who walks with a stick, was attacked as she walked home alone from her local shops

She only managed to escape after running into the road and into the arms of a passing motorist.

Today, Mrs Bright said she was 'too frightened' to leave the house following the attack, which happened near the junction of Brightwell Road and Catton Grove Road.

'I don't know what these lads look like so I can't keep my eyes open for them,' she said.

'I'm so frightened they're going to come after me. It's got to the stage where all I want to do is stay indoors.'

Mrs Bright, who had life-saving surgery last Christmas following problems with an artery in her groin, had been walking home at 7.30pm on Saturday, October 19, when the thugs cornered her.

The teenagers - some of whom were on bikes - started hurling foul-mouthed abuse at her, before launching a brutal, physical assault.

'They just called me a retard and a waste of space and said people like me shouldn't be walking the earth,' she said.

'I just said "just go away, leave me alone". The next thing I knew I was being kicked in the back of my legs and knocked to the ground.

'They started kicking me in the head and in the body, and kicked my shopping all over the road. They all had a kick. They were laughing as well.'

Mrs Bright, who also suffers from a bad back, added: 'There could have been one or two of them urinating on me, but I was just trying to protect my face.'

The terrified grandmother eventually managed to get up, before running into the road to try to escape her attackers.

'One car nearly hit me, but swerved and carried on - but next car stopped,' she said.

'These two lads said "get in the car, get in the car". They looked pretty scared, but saw the youths running off. I got into the car and they brought me home.

'If they hadn't picked me up, I hate to think what things could have happened. I was absolutely petrified.'

Mrs Bright suffered severe bruising and shock after the attack - but her psychological scars run deeper.

'I'm just too scared to go out,' she said. 'I've already got spinal problems so I like to try and get out and walk if I can. I'm trying to get my life back on track but it's very hard.'

She added: 'If anyone saw anything please come forward because these lads need to be caught because they're not going to stop at me.'

Anyone with information about the attack should call PC Alexis Darby of Norwich North Safer Neighbourhood Team on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
