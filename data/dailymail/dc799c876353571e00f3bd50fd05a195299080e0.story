A gang of cannibals murdered their victims and baked their remains into pies to sell a real-life version of the Sweeney Todd, a court has heard.

Brazilian trio Jorge Negromonte, 50, his wife Isabel Pires, 51, and his mistress Bruna da Silva, 25, are said to have lured the women to their house with the promise of work as a nanny before beheading, dismembering and quartering them.

The cult members then used their victims’ flesh to make stuffed pastries, known as empanadas, which they devoured themselves and sold to neighbours for 30p each police claimed.

Yesterday they appeared at court for the first time in their home town of Pernambuco, north-east Brazil, accused of murdering Jessica da Silva, Alexandra Falcao and Gisele da Silva, but did not enter pleas.

However, police have previously said the alleged cannibals have confessed to killing another six unidentified people.

The sickening allegations echo those of fictional barber Sweeney Todd in Victorian London.

The murderous shop owner cut the throats of his victims before his accomplice Mrs Lovett baked their flesh into meat pies and sold them to unsuspecting customers of her shop.

They allegedly killed 17-year-old Jessica da Silva in 2008, who was living with them along with her one-year-old daughter.

Her innocent baby daughter was forced to eat pies made from her mother's flesh as part of a ‘purification ritual’, it has been claimed.

Police caught the trio after one of the women tried to use the credit card belonging to a girl who had been reported missing near their house.

They dug up the garden and found two bodies, believed to be local girls Alexandra Falcao, 20, and Gisele da Silva, 30.

Both victims had reportedly been seen near the house just before they disappeared. 

But Negromonte's brother Irenaeus told the court that he was not capable of the crime because his brother is vegetarian.

'His vegetarianism means it would be a contradiction for him to eat human flesh,'he said.

In
tears, Negromonte's other brother, Emanuel, said: 'As a child, Jorge 
was a normal teenager and had friends. But by age 17, he designed comics
that had scenes of violence against women.'

The alleged murders mimic those of fictional killer Sweeney Todd, famously played by Johnny Depp in the 2007 film remake

The alleged killers previously told police they were members of a sect called Cartel, which aimed to purify the world and reduce the population.

After searching their house, police found a 50-page handwritten handbook with detailed writings and drawings on cannibalism.

Five witnesses appeared in front of a judge at the court in Olinda, Pernambuco, to give evidence of the relationship between the three defendants.

‘These testimonies are to prove that Jorge Beltrao and Isabel Cristina were married, he had an affair with Bruna da Silva, who subsequently passed herself off as Jessica da Silva after killing her and keeping her daughter,’ prosecutor Eliane Gaia said, according to Brazilian reports.

Lawyers for Negromonte reportedly filed a claim of insanity.
