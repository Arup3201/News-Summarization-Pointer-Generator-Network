Andy Murray is making the most of his free time away from Davis Cup preparation by visiting Scotland's home of football, Hampden Park.

The Scotsman and his teammates face the USA at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow with Murray set for an emotional homecoming with brother Jamie also in their team. 

The Great Britain star posted the photograph of himself posing on the Hampden Park on his Instagram page after finishing training.

He said: 'Spent a bit of time looking around Hampden Park after practice today... Beautiful stadium..' 

The World No 5 helped defeat the Americans 3-1 in the quarter-finals last year and he'll be hoping for a repeat result at the weekend.

Murray has an impressive record in the Davis Cup and the Scot has won 19 out 21 single matches since he first played back in 2005.
