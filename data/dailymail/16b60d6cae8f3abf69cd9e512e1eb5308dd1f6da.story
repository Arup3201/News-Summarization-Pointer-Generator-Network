We have all been in that nerve-racking position of sending off a CV and hoping for the best. 

But for 18-year-old Heather McNab, the reply she received for her application for a job as a letting and sales negotiator for an estate agent was quicker than she envisaged. 

Sadly, this was because - rather than wowing her potential future employers with her dazzling CV - Ms McNab had accidentally attached a Jamie Oliver recipe for chilli con carne instead.

Still, Ms McNab had the heart to laugh off her unfortunate mistake and said the reaction to her tweet - which has been retweeted more than 5,000 times - has been great. 

The 18-year-old from Bridge of Allan in Scotland said: 'People keep replying to the original tweet, telling me how it's made their day and they've never laughed so much in their life, and that's so good to hear, especially how I was so unbelievably embarrassed at first.

'There's also a lot of people saying things like "you should have got the job if you promised to make the chilli" and if only they were right, because I'm starting to believe they may not see me as a viable candidate now.'

But she added that it could make a 'good conversation starter' and was reassured by Jamie Oliver's company telling her 'to be fair, it is a really good recipe.'  

She later joked: 'Worst day of my life ha ha ha.'
