They had only been in their new enclosure for two weeks, but these polar bears were intent on making their presence known.

So when a white peacock swooped into their territory at Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo in Austria, it wasn't long before one bear had the bird in its sights.

Captured on video, visitors watched in horror as Lynn, the female polar bear, caught the helpless animal, bit into its neck and viciously tore it apart.

Danger: The peacock, which had been strutting around the enclosure just seconds before, is snared by a polar bear at Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo in Austria

Rip: Lynn, the female bear, then tears the bird with its teeth after it made a desperate attempt to fly away

The peacock had been strutting around the enclosure just seconds before, but when the bear came running over the peacock realised it was in a grave situation.

The bird initially tried to fly away, but didn't clear the wall and dropped back into the water, where the bear was waiting,

Delighted with the treat, Lynn ran around the cage with it to stop her mate Ranzo getting a share of the catch.

She then consumed the bird, leaving a trail of bloody white feathers in her wake.

Selfish: She then runs off with the bird in a bid to stop her mate Ranzo from getting a share of the meal

Flea: Lynn continues her escape with the feathers of the bird spread out of her mouth

Now there are fears for the zoos 
remaining three peacocks who have been seen flying into the polar bear 
enclosure apparently looking for their missing pal.

Zoo visitor David Maier said: 'The 
other white peacock stands on the wall of the polar bear enclosure 
calling all the time for its missing pal, it is really sad.'

The
 birds made themselves at home there during the past year when the polar
 bear enclosure was renovated and had no any predators.

Now the fear is that the others may fly into their deaths, including the only remaining white peacock.

Dinner: The bears emerge from behind a rock with Lynn dragging the peacock while clasped in its teeth

Scrap: The pair had only been in their enclosure for two weeks before one attacked the helpless bird

Terrifying: Visitors watched in shock as the polar bear continued to walk around the enclosure with white feathers hanging from its mouth

The Indian Peafowl peacock suffers from Leucism, a defect which turns pigment cells that turn them into feathered albinos.

The
 polar bears were brought to Vienna only two weeks ago after spending 
the last two years in the Netherlands and Finland while the renovations 
on their enclosure were carried out.

In
 the meantime, the peacocks had been allowed to fly into their empty 
cage, a luxury that was later to cost the life of at least one of them 
after he failed to notice the cage's new arrivals.

Hungry: Ranzo follows his mate in a bid to get the remaining parts of the catch

Remains: Feathers lay scattered over the floor of the enclosure as the bear continues to eat the peacock
