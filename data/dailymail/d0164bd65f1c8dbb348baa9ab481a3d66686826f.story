The opportunity to win an unprecedented third Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe has inspired owner Sheik Joaan Al Thani to dramatically abandon plans to retire Treve to stud.

So certain was it that Treve’s racing career was over that plans to mate her with stallion Dubawi had been announced 48 hours after winning Europe’s most valuable race a week ago.

The unexpected news, which came after discussions with Treve’s trainer Criquette Head-Maarek, emerged hours after it had been announced Aidan O’Brien’ s dual Derby winner Australia had been retired, a hoof infection preventing him from bowing out at Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday.

The absence of the colt is a major blow to Britain’s end-of-season fixture, which has already lost Kingman, the John Gosden-trained outstanding miler of the season.

In contrast, the prospect seeing Treve, the seventh horse to win the Arc twice, as a five-year-old is a major boost to European Flat racing.

Harry Herbert, spokesman for Sheik Joaan’s Al Shaqab Racing, said: ‘Sheik Joaan and his family went to see Treve and discussed it with the Head family.

‘The Sheik said to me this is why we are in the game – to try to do these sort of things, to break barriers.

‘He wants to give her a chance to write her name in the history books and be trained specifically to try to win a third Arc.

‘It will also allow fans, which she has in Qatar and around world, to enjoy her for another season.

‘The welfare of the filly obviously comes first but she is sound and well.’

Herbert confirmed that veteran French jockey Thierry Jarnet will retain the mount on Treve, leaving Sheik Joaan’s retained jockey Frankie Dettori once again a frustrated observer.

Jarnet was on board Treve for the 2013 Arc after Dettori broke his ankle and controversially re-called for this year’s race at the request of Head-Maarek after Dettori had been on board for her three defeats.

A campaign of possibly no more than three races could be on the agenda in 2015 for Treve, whose two-length victory last week was as unexpected as it was extraordinary.

She was allowed to start at 11-1 after a campaign hindered by back and hoof problems.

William Hill make her 4-1 to land a third Arc and Herbert added: ‘She is unlikely to run until the end of June or July and have a programme which could possibly take in a race like the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, the Prix Vermeille and the Arc – little more than that.

‘Criquette is very excited – she knows it is possible Treve could win a third Arc. She has not got a zillion miles on the clock, she is fairly lightly raced (with nine runs).’

Neither is Australia. He heads to his owners’ Coolmore Stud having raced only eight times, winning five and just over £2million.

When O’Brien claimed in the aftermath of the chestnut colt’s 2,000 Guineas third that Australia was the best he had ever trained, it both raised expectations and eyebrows.

Subsequent wins both the Investec Derby at Epsom, the Irish Derby at the Curragh and the International Stakes at York – all Group Ones – went some way to justifying that comment.

A final second place to The Grey Gatsby in the Irish Champion owed much to the race unfolding as a tactical nightmare for jockey Joseph O’Brien.

With his impeccable breeding – his father is super sire Galileo and his dam seven-time Group One winner Ouija Board – Australia was always going to be too valuable a breeding property to be raced on next year.

But the fact he disappointingly sidestepped what would have been a tantalising clash with Treve in the Arc and is denied a final race leaves a frustrating feeling of unfinished business.

Kevin Buckley, Coolmore’s UK respresentative, said: ‘We were all looking forward to it (going to Ascot), but, as you can appreciate, any type of setback like that jeopardises the training regime.’
