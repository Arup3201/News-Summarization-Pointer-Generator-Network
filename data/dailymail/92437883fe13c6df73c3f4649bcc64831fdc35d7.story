Pervert: Phillip Michael Jackson, 55, was arrested after putting a cameraphone into a bottle and videoing a 14-year-old girl. He was banned from the internet but a judge overturned the decision (file picture)

A perverted snooper who used a secret camera to video a 14-year old girl in the shower and was banned from using the internet will now be allowed to go online after a judge ruled the ban 'unreasonable'.

Phillip Michael Jackson, 55, was arrested after the suspicious youngster spotted a flashing light in a shampoo bottle and found a mobile phone behind a hole.

The police investigation found hundreds of sex images, featuring animals and children as young as four, stored on his computer.

Jackson, of Dartford in Kent, was sentenced to a community order with three years supervision at Woolwich Crown Court in June this year.

He was also hit with a sexual offences prevention order (SOPO), banning him from owning a computer, using a camera in public, coming into contact with children at work and allowing the police to raid his home at any time.

But after he complained that he was being cut off from the world, appeal court judges ruled it is 'unreasonable nowadays to ban anyone from accessing the internet in their home'.

Mr Justice Collins and Judge Nicholas Cooke QC, sitting at Londonâ€™s Criminal Appeal Court, overturned the strict SOPO, replacing it with an order that he simply make his internet history available for viewing by the police.

His lawyers argued that the order imposed by the Crown Court judge - which he said should last until the day Jackson died - was unnecessary and disproportionate.

Mr Justice Collins told the court: 'The judge imposing the SOPO said, "I anticipate that you will die subject to this order - that is my wish anyway." They were not appropriate remarks to have made.'

Also criticising the 'lurid language' used by the judge, he concluded that the SOPO imposed on Jackson was 'entirely excessive'.

'Nowadays it is entirely unreasonable to ban anybody from accessing the internet in their home,' the appeal judge concluded.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
