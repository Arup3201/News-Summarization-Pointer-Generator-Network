British swimming star Ellie Simmonds smashed her own world record in the pool last night as she claimed her second gold medal of London 2012.

The 17-year-old took her fourth Paralympic gold medal with a stunning swim in the women’s 200m individual medley.

After trailing her rivals for most of the race, the teenager – who has a condition called achondroplasia, or dwarfism – finished in a stunning sprint to win the race in a remarkable 3.05.39.

Champion: Swimming star Ellie Simmonds smashed her own world record to claim her second gold medal of London 2012

In doing so she broke the world record she herself had set only hours before in qualifying for the race.

With two events still to go, Simmonds
 is now likely to become the biggest superstar of the Paralympics after 
the controversy surrounding defeated South African blade runner Oscar 
Pistorius.

Experts say Simmonds is likely to net hundreds of thousands of pounds in sponsorship.

She has also been tipped to feature in the next honours list and to win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year title.

Watched by her proud parents Steve 
and Val, the Briton had turned into the final freestyle leg more than 
five metres down but roared on by the crowd she was back on level terms 
within a few strokes before powering away to win easily.

Fellow Briton Natalie Jones, 27, claimed bronze.

A jubilant Simmonds punched the water with delight and gave her now trademark grin on realising she had broken another record.

David Cameron was on his feet to roar
 on the Briton to her second victory, which came 48 hours after her 
world record-breaking performance in the 400m captured the heart of the 
nation.

There were boos mixed with the cheers
 as the Prime Minister stepped forward to present the medals but they 
turned to roars as Simmonds, her grin as wide as her medal, was given 
her gold and a kiss on both cheeks by Mr Cameron.

Chancellor George Osborne was also booed as he performed a similar role for the men’s 400m.

Simmonds, after singing the National Anthem along with the crowd, said: ‘I’m on a mission at the moment.

‘It’s the biggest event of my life and I just want to do the best that I can.

'I like to be nervous – it gets my 
adrenaline going. So far I’ve dealt with the pressure. It’s pushed me to
 show what I’m made of.’

She added: ‘I am chuffed, I have two more races to come, and it is amazing to do this in front of this home crowd.

‘I have two golds, and I have two more to concentrate on. Let’s hope I wake up tomorrow in form.’

There was a silver for Sascha Kindred
 in the 200m SM6 individual – he had been going for his fourth straight 
gold in the event – to add to the silver won earlier in the pool by his 
wife Nyree.

And Newcastle University graduate Susannah Rodgers, 28, took a bronze in the women’s 100m freestyle S7.

Elsewhere in the Olympic Stadium 
wheelchair sprinter Mickey Bushell smashed the Paralympic record in the 
100m as he powered to the gold in 14.75 seconds.

Roared on by 80,000 fans, the 
Shropshire-born 22-year-old surged ahead in the early stages of the race
 and comfortably held on to his lead all the way to the finish line.

The British world record holder, who 
was born without the lower part of his spinal cord as the result of a 
rare congenital impairment, thanked the fans for their incredible 
support, saying: ‘It was fantastic. It went a lot better than I 
thought.’

Bushell, who won silver in Beijing, 
added: ‘This is the one I wanted. I knew I had to work for it. It has 
been a very hard four years.’

The 17-year-old said: I'm just so pleased - another world record. I'm just so chuffed.'

Simmonds' win came at the Aquatics Centre in the Olympic Park in east London
