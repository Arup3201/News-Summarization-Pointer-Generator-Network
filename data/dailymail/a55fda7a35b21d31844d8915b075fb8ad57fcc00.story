Meet the mouth of the NYPD's police union.

As tense protests gripped New York streets before a gunman fatally shot two officers in cold blood, Patrick Lynch, the 51-year-old head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the NYPD's largest union, has been swift to assign blame.

'There's blood on many hands,' Lynch boomed the night that Officers Wen Jian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed by a man who referenced Eric Garner and Michael Brown in an Instagram post before the killing.

'That blood on the hands starts at City Hall in the office of the mayor,' Lynch said just after Bill de Blasio held a press conference where some NYPD officers literally turned their backs on him.

It wasn't the first time  Lynch has refused to let a good crisis go to waste for his union.

After the mayor gave a speech about telling his teenage son, who is black, of 'dangers he may face' from police following the grand jury decision not to indict the officer accused of killing Eric Garner with a chokehold, Lynch said de Blasio was 'throwing them under the bus.'

'That they were out there doing a difficult job in the middle of the night, protecting the rights of those to protest, protecting our sons and daughter,' he said, according to CBS.

Lynch hasn't been shy about flogging mayors in public over pay or disciplinary disputes. The Associated Press reports Lynch said past mayors have critiqued police or been tightfisted with officer pay, but never both like de Blasio.

PBA members held a 1 a.m. protest at the home of then-mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2004 seeking to sweeten pay, and Lynch later accused the mayor of 'stealing' pensions when he tried to curtail them in 2011.

Lynch has also deflected  criticism and disciplinary control of the NYPD, even when it came from NYPD officials. 

The New York Post reports that Lynch called NYPD Internal Affairs a 'white socks' department while it pursued an investigation into a ticket fixing scandal.

'They’re unprofessional, they never prove a case,' Lynch railed. 'They don’t go after real corruption, they go out where the police officers are, wearing white socks, and then they fabricate from there. They’re not real professionals.'

Before that, Businessweek reports, Lynch had defended the practice of officers making parking and traffic tickets disappear for friends as a 'courtesy' and said it was a 'long standing practice at all levels of the department.' 

The president even called for the resignation of former police commissioner Ray Kelly in 2004, after he said there appeared 'to be no justification' for the shooting of unarmed Timothy Stansbury, and suggested the real victim was the officer that shot the teenager.

Lynch, who started working for the city in the Metropolitan Transit Authority, where his father worked as a motorman before joining the NYPD in 1984.

He became an early fixture in the PBA, becoming a delegate before being elected president in 1999, the youngest officer to do so in the union's history. 

Still, there have always been factions of the PBA that think leadership doesn't go far enough. 

In 1997, during protests over a pay dispute with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a small group of police marched through Brooklyn shouting, 'Rudy's a liar, set him on fire!'

Lynch faced a mutiny of Bronx members over the ticket fixing affair in 2011, with around 50 delegates calling for his resignation because he did not lend enough support to those accused, before walking out.

As Commissioner Bratton says Lynch must stop the 'cheap shots,' the five-term PBA president Lynch states that he speaks for the rank-and-file patrolman on his force.

'These ideas and issues aren't created at PBA headquarters. They come from the ground up,' Lynch says, calling the anger 'palatable.'
