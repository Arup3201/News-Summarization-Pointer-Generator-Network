Wayne Rooney has described England team-mate John Terry as the 'toughest defender' he has ever faced - while Danny Welbeck has lifted the lid on why he is nicknamed 'dat guy'.

The Manchester United duo answered fans' questions in a Nike Football video and revealed what they think their best goals for the club have been and what their favourite moments at Old Trafford have been. 

The pair have endured a difficult start to the season, with Louis van Gaal's side having taken just one point from two Premier League matches.

When asked who the toughest defender he has ever faced is, Rooney replied: 'I would have to say John Terry is the toughest defender I've played against. He reads the game really well, he's physical and he's tough to play against so you know you're always in for a tough game when you play against him.'

Welbeck, meanwhile, explained why he is referred to as 'dat guy'. He said: 'It's something you can't really explain, "dat guy", and anyone can be "dat guy" in a certain situation. Wazza (Rooney) was "dat guy" the other day. It's just a bit of slang like, growing up in Manchester people are called "dat guy" or if you do something you're "dat guy" and I think that's how it just started. I'm "dat guy".'

The young striker also revealed his admiration for United legend, and current assistant manager, Ryan Giggs when he was growing up. 'Obviously as a United fan it was Ryan Giggs - I loved watching him play since I was a little kid,' he said. 

Unsurprisingly, United captain Rooney declared that his overhead kick against Manchester City was his best goal.

He said: 'I would have to say my goal against Manchester City. It was 1-1 with 10 minutes to go. Scored an overhead kick in the derby which won us the game. It was definitely my best goal.

When asked the same question, Welbeck joked: 'At Old Trafford against City I scored an overhead kick and ran to the corner...

'No, I think my favourite goal is my first goal for Manchester United against Stoke in the Premier League.'
