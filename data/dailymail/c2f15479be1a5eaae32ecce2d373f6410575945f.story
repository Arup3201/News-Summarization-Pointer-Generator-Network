A mound of spaghetti sits in a bowl with a heaping of tomatoes. Exactly nine puckered capers and a measly two slivers of anchovy perch rather inelegantly atop the pile.

On the side tiny serving of mustard, some slices of gherkin and a wodge of waxed cheese. To wash it down is a cup of pink-strained tea.

As last meals go, it's not the most glamorous of repasts.

This is what Doomsday Prepper Kellene Bishop, a resident in Utah, US, will eat on the day the world ends.

Texan Wayne Martin's last meal is a bowl of Campbell’s chicken and spaghetti soup and a side serving of gourmet cat food. He washes it down with a glass of his homemade white wine which he will use as barter in lieu of money once the apocalypse begins 

Wilma Bryant from Missouri will feast on thyme-roast chicken covered in gravy and served with beans. Ms Bryant lives with her daughter and the pair are both diabetic and dependent on insulin. Her meal is juxtaposed against syringes and medical paraphernalia

This stark photograph as well as six others were capured by Brooklyn-based photographer Henry Hargreaves.

Mr Hargreaves, who is a self-confessed food obsessive explained: 'In the US alone there are over 3 million people preparing for the end of time, this sub-culture is known as Doomsday Preppers.'

He is most famous for his No Seconds series, immortalising the Death Row choices of inmates.

The photographer visited the preppers to discuss their menus with them before he created their last meals.

'I connected with some of them to discuss their Armageddon Menu's,' he said.

'They are designed around their religious beliefs, lifestyles, location, health and what they think will work on the heels of the disaster they predict.' 

He confesses that he expected the series to be more dramatic than the final results he captured, and admits that the preppers might be on to something.

'Initially I expected this to be a rather sensational series but as I spoke to some of the subjects I actually was surprised by the brilliance in their approach.

'They have been able to stand back and see the whole food system from afar and realize in any kind of disaster the food distribution chain is the first thing to break and they don't want to be left vulnerable, if and when it does.'

Each photograph is accompanied by text which explains a little bit more about the individual Doomsday Prepper.

Using the ingredients the preppers had stocked up on Mr Hargreaves concocted meals he envisioned they would be eating if our current social system collapses.

Ms Bishop, whose meal opens the series, is referred to as a self-sufficiency and self-defence educator. A foodie with a vast pantry, her Mormon faith endorses prepping.

She doesn't want the experience to change her diet and constantly rotates her food stored, which includes waxed cheese, pickled vegetables, vacuum sealed meats, freeze-dried foods and pasta.

The next meal, of thyme-roast chicken covered in gravy and served with beans is shown juxtaposed against syringes and medical paraphernalia.

Mr Hargreaves created this dish for Wilma Bryant from Missouri, US. The diabetic mother who is insulin-dependent lives with her daughter who who suffers from the same condition.

Their low-carb high protein diet is more out of necessity than choice as they have to avoid raising their blood sugar.

The duo, who believe the world will end in a fury of tornadoes, keep live chickens to butcher and store their insulin in a nearby stream to keep cold so it will not turn bad as it only lasts six months.

As well as the live chickens, their food stores include beans, nuts, soup and pickled goods.

'I created dishes that they will potentially be eating once the system breaks and they have become self sufficient. Through their choices of these foods I think their personal story comes to life,' he continued.

The last meal of New York firefighter Jason Charles who has a huge store of ready-to-eat meals or MRE. He is also stocked up on water in a waterbob, packets of ramen and other shelf canned goods

But some meals are not so elaborate.

New York firefighter Jason Charles was an emergency responder in the 9/11 attacks and worries that air pollution will kill us all.

His apartment in New York City can he sealed off like a bunker and he uses a Waterbob (emergency drinking water storage) as a bathtub.

This prepper's last meal is one of the most basic in the series and consists of a ready-to-eat meal or MRE. The firefighters stocks are more MREs, his waterbob, packets of ramen and other shelf canned goods.

Pennsylvania City Council Candidate Josh Wander is an Orthodox Jew who admitted to Mr Hargreaves that due to his kosher diet his 'food choices are uninspiring.'

He mainly stocks kosher MREs and his last meal consists of matzo crackers with rice and a food ration bar.

In his accompanying text, Mr Wander states that the 'Torah states breaking kosher is acceptable if your life depends on it' and so he keeps a flock of rabbits in case times become desperate. His children are not allowed to name the rabbits as 'they are raised for dinner, not pets'.

He believes that terrorist attacks will end the world. 

A tumble of insects – crickets, meal worms and grasshoppers – is served with a measly shaving of Parmesan. On the side a salad of sprouting seeds.

This Spartan offering is destined to be the last meal of John Major of Idaho, US. He is concerned radioactive dirty bombs will be denoted around the US, ending all life.

'Soil is one of the best defences against radioactivity,' the accompanying text states. And so Mr Major buries a bank of over 1.5m sprouting seeds. He also forages and collects insects which form his primary intake of protein, and keep bees for honey and medicine.

Rick Austin, a sustainable homesteader and author who lives in the Appalachian Mountains has a last meal of well-cooked steak served with buttered corn on the cob, and a salad

Rick Austin, a sustainable homesteader and author who lives in the Appalachian Mountains in the US, told Mr Hargreaves that his 'health has greatly improved since adopting the prepping lifestyle.'

'Plant once, harvest for a lifetime,' is his motto and the prepper is totally self-sufficient from his land.

A combination of fresh and preserved foods make up his stores and alongside fruit, vegetables, beef (from his own lifestock), milk and cheese, honey, nuts and smoked meats, he also keeps bees for honey and medicine, alongside.

His last meal is a well-cooked steak served with buttered corn on the cob, and a salad of leaves.

The final photograph in the series is the only to feature any alcohol.

Texan Wayne Martin stores all his canned goods in buckets of cat litter to increase the life expectancy of the products.

He also keeps cat food – which he says can be consumed if needed - on reserve as they won't be stolen by those of us who are unprepared.

The consultant engineer has homemade Wayne's World wine which he plans to use as barter in lieu of money.

His meal, composed from his stored food, is a bowl of Campbell's chicken and spaghetti soup and a side serving of gourmet cat food.

Mr Martin believes Doomsday will be brought about by 'financial collapse caused by the Chinese.'
