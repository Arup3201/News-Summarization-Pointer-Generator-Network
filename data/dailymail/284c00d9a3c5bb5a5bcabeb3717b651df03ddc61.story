Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has reportedly argued with the Prime Minister after reading media reports that a male colleague would 'chaperone' her to the United Nations climate change conference next week.

Ms Bishop supposedly confronted Tony Abbott this week after reading  in the Sun-Herald that he had personally requested Trade Minister Andrew Robb to chaperone her to the international summit in Lima, Peru.

'Julie went bananas at the PM,' a source told the Australian Financial Review.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop reportedly confronted Tony Abbott this week after reading media reports that Trade Minister Andrew Robb would 'chaperone' her to a climate change summit in Peru

The Foreign Minister was not consulted about Mr Robb shadowing her and is said to have confronted him over the matter as well.

It comes amid suggestions that Mr Robb, who is below Ms Bishop in the Cabinet ranks, was being sent to Peru to ensure Australia wasn't over-committing on its climate change policy promises.

'It's like they don't trust Julie,' a source told the newspaper.

Mr Robb, who is currently in China, is being sent to the climate change summit over Environment Minister Greg Hunt.

The Sun-Herald reported on Sunday that Mr Robb would 'chaperone Ms Bishop so he can factor in the economic impacts of any new targets Australia considers'. 

Mr Robb was instrumental in triggering the end of  Malcolm Turnbull's leadership when he turned against the former leader in 2009 and criticised carbon pricing.

When contacted by Daily Mail Australia on Thursday, Ms Bishop's office would not be drawn on the exchange with Mr Abbott.

But the Foreign Minister told reporters on Wednesday it was important for both Mr Robb and herself to attend.

Ms Bishop  stepped out  at the Melbourne Cup races last month, fueling speculation that she was in a relationship with businessman David Panton

'This has significant economic impacts, so both the trade minister and foreign minister will be there,' she said. 

'We will most certainly be involved in the conversation about post-2020 targets, that’s what the Lima Conference is all about in the lead up to the Paris Conference next year. What I’ll be particularly interested in is hearing from the major emitters as to their targets and whether they’ll be binding targets. 

'It’s all very well for Australia to be lectured by countries that won’t meet their Kyoto targets and refuse to be committed to binding targets, but we will most certainly be involved in the conversation as to what is do-able, economy-by-economy, country-by-country, that’s why both Andrew Robb and I will be there.'
