A former civilian U.S. Army employee has pleaded guilty to theft after being accused of stealing sophisticated military equipment from a Northern California depot and trading some of it for marijuana.

Devon Gregory Biggs, 38, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to theft of government property from the Sierra Army Depot in Herlong in Lassen County.

Prosecutors say he stole machine gun components, night vision goggles, technology that uses lasers for Illumination and low-light video recording equipment.

Officials previously said the equipment was valued at nearly $85,000 and had recently been returned from Afghanistan and Iraq.

On at least one occasion, Biggs sold the stolen equipment for marijuana. 

This case is the product of an investigation by the Law Enforcement Division of the United States Army, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

Assistant United States Attorneys Jean Hobler and Christiaan Highsmith are prosecuting the case.

Biggs formerly of Reno, Nevada, could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine at a hearing in January.

The actual sentence, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.
