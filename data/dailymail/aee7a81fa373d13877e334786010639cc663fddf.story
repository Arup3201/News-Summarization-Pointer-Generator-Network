David Osborne said consent must be considered in rape cases even if given when 'blind drunk'

A senior barrister has caused outrage after saying that men should be cleared of rape if a female victim claimed to be too drunk to consent to sex.

In a blog entitled She Was Gagging For It, David Osborne, 71, condemned new Crown Prosecution Service guidelines which put the onus on men to seek explicit consent from drunken partners.

The married father-of-four made a point of referring to women in rape cases as ‘complainants’ rather than victims, and said the guidelines could result in ‘everything possible in the trial process’ being ‘bent towards the conviction of the accused’.

Mr Osborne wrote: ‘Consent is consent, blind drunk or otherwise, and regret after the event cannot make it rape. I have a simple solution.

‘If the complainant (I do not refer to her as the victim) was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both, when she was “raped”, this provides the accused with a complete defence. End of story and a victory for fairness, moderation and common sense!’

‘My considerable experience tells me that there are basically two defences to an allegation of rape: either “it wasn’t me gov”, or “she was gagging for it”.’

The blog has prompted a furious response from victims’ organisations and rape victims. His remarks were also condemned as ‘simply wrong’ by the leading barrister in the area where Mr Osborne operates.

In media interviews over the weekend Mr Osborne said rape statistics would fall if women who ‘trollop around with their t*ts out’ stopped getting ‘legless’ and ‘covered up’.

He claimed women who dress provocatively ‘send out certain signals’ and give ‘lads the opportunity to think, “She looks like a goer”.’

Yesterday Mr Osborne told the Daily Mail he believed the ‘Government and prosecution service are going too far the other way’.

Speaking at the large bungalow he shares with wife Sally, 63, in Combe Florey, Somerset, he added: ‘It does happen where the girl says she’s up for it – she wants a quickie – and then it is unpleasant and torrid and terrible.

‘There are no violins playing, it’s round the back of the community centre. The next morning she wakes up and feels ashamed. It’s very easy for her to convince herself that she did not actually consent.’

Last month, the CPS announced that new guidance on rape cases and the issue of consent would be issued to police forces.

Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said: ‘Consent to sexual activity is not a grey area – in law it is clearly defined and must be given fully and freely.

‘We want police and prosecutors to make sure they ask in every case where consent is the issue – how did the suspect know the complainant was saying yes and doing so freely and knowingly?’

But Mr Osborne – nicknamed the Barrister Bard after once delivering his final speech to a trial jury entirely in verse – said: ‘My experience says that the jury gives the evidence the attention it requires and if they are sure then they convict. We don’t need to manipulate the system for rape witnesses.’

Mr Osborne worked as a criminal defence barrister for almost 40 years and was last involved in a rape trial three years ago. He is a member of the Western Circuit of barristers and now concentrates on civil law.

His blog has been roundly condemned. Sarah Green, director of End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ‘I find it hard to believe this is not a sick joke. He is suggesting the opposite of the law.’

Louise Pennington, of campaign group Ending Victimisation, said: ‘He is saying that men are incapable of controlling their own urges when they see a woman in a short skirt.’

Andrew Langdon QC, leader of the Western Circuit, said: ‘I have spoken to David Osborne and told him that I consider his blog to be offensive.

‘Most of what he says is simply wrong. The views he articulates are not remotely representative of barristers who prosecute and defend these cases in practice.’

One victim, a 45-year-old female jogger who was abducted and repeatedly raped at knife-point by a career criminal out on licence from prison, said: ‘Rape is rape, when a woman or a man does not give consent for sex to occur despite the fact that drugs or alcohol have been consumed.

‘If a man or woman takes advantage of the opposite sex in this reduced state of awareness, it is a predatory action.’

Mr Osborne’s blog is written under the masthead ‘witty, incisive comment on the law today’. Last night he planned to republish an edited version of the controversial blog entry – after being warned by the Circuit that the original piece may be considered to bring the profession into disrepute if it remained online.

A Bar Standards Board spokesman declined to comment.
