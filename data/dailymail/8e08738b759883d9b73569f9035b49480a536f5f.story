Revelling in the sunshine and with the prospect of a good day out ahead of them, the scene as racegoers arrived for the first day of Glorious Goodwood couldn't have been more quintessentially English.

And in true race day style, the hats were big and the dresses colourful as cheerfully dressed ladies made their way into the Sussex racecourse for their day out at the races.

Among the most spectacular were the hats worn by guests Charlie Elmy-Britton and Layla Leigh, who had both splashed out on super-sized titfers made from iridescent peacock feathers and delicate grey marabou.

Stylish: Many of the racegoers at Glorious Goodwood plumped for hats in elegant café au lait hues, while Sharon Ainslie (right) opted for cheerful orange

Others plumped for more classic styles with wide-brimmed hats in elegant café au lait and caramel hues proving particularly popular among the Goodwood sorority.

Although not quite hitting the sartorial heights of Ascot, Glorious Goodwood is catching up in the fashion stakes as more and more racegoers take the opportunity to dress up for the occasion.

Like its Berkshire counterpart, Goodwood also operates a strict dress code that outlaws jeans and shorts and insists that guests keep their shoulders covered and eschew fancy dress.

Instead, the style guide suggests 'jackets and either ties, cravats or polo neck sweaters' for gentlemen and 'smart casual' for ladies, adding that 'due to the terrain and areas of decking at Goodwood, flat shoes are recommended'.

Racegoers certainly appeared to be taking those strictures to heart, with no sign of the wacky hats, skintight frocks and skyscraper heels that characterise other meets, most notably Aintree.

On the course, racing action got underway with the bet365.com Handicap which was taken by Irish bred gelding Stomachion, with Sir Alex Ferguson's I'm Fraam Govan in second place and the Queen's horse Sea Shanty in third.

The Lennox Stakes, the big race of the day, was won by two-year-old colt Toormore, who beat another Ferguson horse, Garswood, into second place to claim the prize.

Tomorrow will see the Irish Guineas and St James's Palace Stakes winner Kingman take on the hotly tipped Toronado in the biggest race of Glorious Goodwood, the Sussex Stakes, in a run that has already been dubbed the 'Duel on the Downs' by racing pundits.

While Cheltenham is famous for pearls and fur, and Aintree for its colourfully dressed fillies in fake tan and skyscraper heels, Glorious Goodwood's trademark is low key luxury - and flat shoes.

Delicate bejewelled sandals are the most popular with racegoers, as are Sloaney ballet pumps and in the case of some hardened souls, comfortable loafers and deck shoes.

Nevertheless, the meeting isn't short of glamour with plenty of the big, bold, be-plumed hats of the sort seen at Berkshire's Royal Ascot and neat, nipped-in shift dresses reigning supreme in the paddock.

As at Ascot, racegoers have a strict dress code to contend with which insists on smart-casual in all areas and outlaws bare shoulders and any sort of fancy dress.

'Goodwood is famous for being a stylish 
yet relaxed occasion,' continues the style guide, 'and gentlemen are required to wear jackets and 
either ties, cravats or polo neck sweaters in the Richmond Enclosure.

'Linen suits and Panama Hats are traditionally worn by gentlemen. Jeans 
and shorts are not permitted in the Richmond Enclosure. In other 
enclosures dress is smart casual.

'Bare shoulder tops and fancy dress are not 
allowed in any enclosure. Due to the terrain and areas of decking at 
Goodwood flat shoes are recommended.'
