Privately educated pupils can harm society with their 'bullish and charmless' over-confidence, a leading headmaster has admitted.

Andrew Halls, head of fee-paying King’s College School in Wimbledon, warned that an independent education can lead to former pupils 'asphyxiating the society they move in'. 

He said that the 'prefect and house' system taught students that influence matters.

Andrew Halls, head of fee-paying King’s College School in Wimbledon, warned that an independent education can lead to former pupils 'asphyxiating the society they move in'

Mr Halls, whose school charges fees for day pupils of £19,500-a-year, said that the 'prefect and house' system taught students that influence matters

Mr Halls told The Times: 'Some independent school children can asphyxiate the society they move in because their confidence is so bullish and charmless. 

'There are downsides to overconfidence; people can feel a bit repelled by it.

The comments come after Homeland actor Damian Lewis revealed that going to Eton was the perfect training for his upcoming role as Henry VIII.

The 43-year-old, who has become one of Britain’s biggest acting exports after making his name with roles in Homeland and Band Of Brothers, 

Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: ‘I think there is no question that it helps having had the kind of schooling I’ve had to play a king.

‘It’s not such a leap oddly – even though the thought of being a monarch of any nation is mind-boggling and not something I could imagine easily at all.

‘But, yes, there’s just the sort of court structure, hierarchies and the way they are set up which is something I understand.’

His comments came after he compared his OBE, which he received on Wednesday afternoon, to being made a school prefect, as he felt it put him under pressure to be extremely responsible and to prove himself.

'I remember when I heard I was being awarded it, it was a little bit like "now you've got to prove it",' he said.

'It was a bit like being asked to be a prefect, now I have to be extremely responsible.' 

Mr Halls clarified his comments to the MailOnline. 

He said: 'They (independent schools) obviously do a fantastic job with most kids, who have a real joy taking part in society.

'What I mean to say, is that we as schools have a responsibility to the children to make sure they do not leave with an excessive sense of entitlement. 

'It is important that independent schools ensure that students leave with a sense of debt, not to us, but to society. 

'Many, not all, have had very fortunate upbringings.

'So many good things, for all of us in the rich west, can make us complacent in the real world.'

He said First World War hero Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse  - was an inspirational example of a privately educated man who gave back to society.

It comes after Homeland actor Damian Lewis revealed that going to Eton was the perfect training for his upcoming role as Henry VIII

Educated at Magdalene College School in Oxford, Chevasse is one of only three people to be awarded a Victoria Cross twice.

He said: 'He had a fantastic education, but he was not a great charmer or a conformist. He was actually quite a difficult man, stubbornly dedicated to the health, wealth and welfare of his men and an incredibly brave captain who saved hundreds of lives. '

At Kings, Mr Halls said students do not have lessons on a Friday afternoon and instead do activities with 27 local state schools as part of a partnership programme. 

He said: 'That to me is what we should be doing more of. We should be out there playing our part in a world which is there to be improved and made healthier. 

'I'm not trying to show off about Kings, and I must sound very hypocritical, but that's my job and I have to try and help these fortunate and good men and women feel commitment to improving circumstances. 

'And they do have that commitment and love for doing good things.'

He has also warned recently that private schools were in danger of becoming the preserve of wealthy oligarchs as fee hikes price out middle-class families.

He warned that many parents in traditionally well-paid careers as accountancy and law were no longer able to afford a private education for their children.

The most expensive private schools were becoming little more than ‘finishing schools for the children of oligarchs’, he said. Some schools had become so reliant on pupils from overseas they were at risk of suffering a banking-style crash.

The actor, 43, said his OBE honour, presented by the Duke of Cambridge, was as a complete surprise, and added: 'It was a bit like being asked to be a prefect, now I have to be extremely responsible'

Prepared: Lewis said his time at English boarding school Eton (pictured) had helped him with his latest role

Fifty private schools in recent years had closed, merged with another school or joined the state system, he said.

Mr Halls, whose school charges fees for day pupils of £19,500-a-year, said: ‘We have allowed the apparently endless queue of wealthy families from across the world knocking at our doors to blind us to a simple truth: we charge too much.

‘Somewhere along the way, first the nurses stopped sending children to us, then the policemen, then armed forces officers, then even the local accountants and lawyers.

‘The most prestigious schools in the world teach the children of the very wealthiest families in the world. A typical boarding school now requires a parent to have a spare £30,000 in taxed income to pay for just one child — every year.

‘We are in danger of coming across as greedy, because we can charge what appears to be limitless fees but in truth there is a fees timebomb ticking away. It feels like the build-up to the banking crisis. For the first time in my career, I feel that the shifts over the next 10 years could prove seismic.’
