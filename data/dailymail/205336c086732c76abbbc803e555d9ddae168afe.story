Is this the mystery collector? Art sources claim Las Vegas tycoon Elaine Wynn is the buyer who paid nearly $150m for Francis Bacon's triptych

The mystery of who bid nearly $150million to buy Francis Bacon's 'Three Studies of Lucian Freud' at a New York auction has apparently now been solved.

After months of speculation, art world sources claim that casino tycoon Elaine Wynn was the telephone bidder who helped make the triptych the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction.

Ms Wynn, the former wife of well-known art collector Stephen Wynn, who co-founded their Las Vegas casino empire, is estimated by Forbes to have a net worth of $1.9billion.

She is understood to be a fan of 
Irish-born artist Bacon and has previously shown interest in buying his 
other triptychs as they have come on the market.

Ms
 Wynn is not the first person to be linked to the record-breaking 
purchase of Bacon's triptych, with Qatari royal Sheikha Mayassa and 
Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich both previously touted as buyers.

The
 1969 work - never before been offered at auction and carrying a 
pre-sale estimate of $85million - sold for $142.4million after a 
protracted bidding war in a packed saleroom and via telephone.

Christie's did not disclose the identity of the successful buyer.

Ms
 Wynn's office told the New York Times that she was away and could not 
be reached for comment. But the paper claims that sources close to her 
say that Bacon is one of her favourite artists.

The triptych is currently on loan to the Portland Art Museum in Oregon, where it is on display until March 30.

At
 the time of the sale, Christies said that Bacon's three-paneled work, 
which depicts the Dublin-born painter's friend and fellow artist Lucian 
Freud on a chair, was 'a true masterpiece that marks Bacon and Freud's 
relationship' and their 'creative and emotional kinship.'

'The juxtaposition of radiant sunshine yellow contrasting with the brutal physicality and immediacy of the brushstrokes in this celebrated life-size triptych is what makes Bacon's art so remarkable,' said Francis Outred, the head of European postwar and contemporary art for Christie's.

'This suddenly becomes a very important conversation between two masters,' Outred said in an interview.

He noted that 'Three Studies of Lucian Freud' is one of only two existing full-length triptychs of Freud, a grandson of the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, and that the three panels were separated for 15 years in the Seventies before being reunited.
