For many newlyweds, a honeymoon is an excuse to begin married life in style, by splashing out on a lavish holiday of a lifetime. 

But one holiday operator has taken it to the next level, launching the world’s most expensive honeymoon, aimed at super-rich newlyweds.

The ultra-luxurious trip comes at an eye-watering price that would even put a dent in the pockets of the mega wealthy.

Once in a lifetime experience: Enjoy a private Mokoro Ride with your loved one

The 14-day trip, which takes in parts of both Southern and East Africa, has been dubbed ‘The World’s Most Expensive Honeymoon’.

The exclusive package is being offered by leading tailor-made safari operator, Discover Africa, and costs a cool £152,348 per couple, including transfers via private jet and helicopter but excluding international flights.

For £10,882 per couple, per day, newlyweds can enjoy a helicopter ride over Cape Town, Table Mountain and the 12 Apostles; stay in a penthouse in an exclusive hotel on the city’s V&A Waterfront; and sip sundowner cocktails on top of Table Mountain.

They can also go on a number of private safaris in some of Africa’s most wildlife-abundant areas including the Serengeti; and take part in an adrenalin-pumping game drive in Tanzania, before glamping overnight.

Brides and grooms can also toast their nuptials on tours of vineyards and estates in the wine-lands not easily available to tourists, via a private 4x4 jeep with a specialist guide.

Other excursions on the trip include visiting a traditional Masai village; shopping for a honeymoon gift of Tanzanite jewellery and gorilla trekking in Rwanda.

What’s more, much of the accommodation is booked exclusively, in order to give newlyweds the ultimate in privacy.

Andre Van Kets, co-founder at Discover Africa, said: ‘Africa is a hugely popular honeymoon destination – it combines romantic locations, beautiful wildlife and breath-taking experiences that will bring newlyweds even closer together – and we wanted to put together a package which combines all three of these aspects, along with some of Southern and East Africa’s most unforgettable sights.‘We have a number of honeymoon packages that cater for a wide range of budgets – from modest budgets to unlimited budgets – but this trip offers a degree of romance that is truly priceless.’

As if that was not enough, there are a number of exclusive extras available to add on, to make the trip even more special.

Guests can splash out on lavish souvenirs and gifts, including as a bottle of vintage Dom Pérignon (£1,500), a Swarovski NC2 night vision telescope (£4,700) for evening safaris and the exotic Kopi Luwak coffee (approx. £165 per kilo), which sees the coffee beans being eaten and digested by the Asian palm civet or ‘toddy cat’.

Philanthropic couples looking to leave a meaningful mark on the continent can choose to do so in a number of ways – whether it’s sponsoring the relocation of a rhino from South Africa to Botswana to help protect the species from threat of extinction due to poachers and the rhino horn trade (£26,500), or donating to the Environmental Education Centre, to aid in the development of Singita Sasakwa’s future leaders (£4,700).
