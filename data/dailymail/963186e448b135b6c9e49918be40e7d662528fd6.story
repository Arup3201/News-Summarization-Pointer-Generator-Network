Throughout his time at Swansea, Brendan Rodgers would frequently reference his years under Jose Mourinho and compare them to a ‘Harvard education’. It probably doesn’t bode well for the apprentice-turned-rival that Mourinho has made a habit of schooling Liverpool in league fixtures as well.

Nine Premier League meetings and seven wins. Only one defeat. It is a match Mourinho simply loves; an occasion that has often drawn his sharpest comments and biggest wins.

It is also a fixture, when set away from league competition, that has brought some of his biggest lows.

Two Champions League semi-final defeats in his first spell at Chelsea and one monumental, enduring tantrum about the Luis Garcia ghost goal of 2005. Those nights ensured his relationship with Rafa Benitez is perhaps as stormy, if not worse, than the one he shares with Arsene Wenger. 

They are fixtures that have helped Mourinho’s legacy in England, both through results and deeds. It is a fixture that has already left a stamp on Rodgers which might yet be crucial to the story of his career.

That April day last season when Steven Gerrard slipped and Demba Ba sauntered through ranks as one of the most dramatic in recent Premier League history. Liverpool were heading towards the most improbable of titles; Gerrard the most spectacular of twilight glories; Rodgers the garlands that come from transforming a team (albeit with the incredible benefit contribution of Luis Suarez). But the Liverpool captain slipped.

Rodgers lost twice against Mourinho in that campaign – his first two games in the opposite dugout to the man who once mentored him in his roles as academy and reserve-team coach at Chelsea.

In an interview with Sportsmail while he was at Swansea, Rodgers said: ‘Jose was simply a wonderful influence on my career. He couldn’t do enough to help a hungry young coach.

‘He was always interested to hear my opinions and to share his. As a young coach, you are forever indebted to people like that, who become such an influence on you.’

By then, Rodgers was speaking with the perspective of a man who had suffered bad, chastening times in management.

When he finally left Chelsea after four years in 2008, he took his first management job at Watford. He did reasonably well, but upset supporters by leaving after seven months to join Reading, where he had coached prior to working at Stamford Bridge.

He lasted six months before getting sacked at Reading and entering the wilderness. ‘I found it very hard to get work,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I spent days writing my thoughts down in notepads, not a laptop, trying to learn from the experience. I like to think in ink.

‘But it was a hard time.’

He went on to Swansea and the rest is history. But it is also that background that will give him a measure of perspective when handling the pressure of this fixture against Chelsea and Mourinho at Anfield.

The questioning of his judgement has never been greater than this week, having drawn enormous criticism for his team selection against Real Madrid.

Liverpool were not hammered, but by stacking his cards in favour of domestic matters against Chelsea, Rodgers cannot afford a bad defeat. If he wins, he will claim a measure of vindication for not setting his best side in a marquee fixture in Spain. If he loses, he will doubtless be pilloried. To think, a ‘ghost goal’ could determine whether he is seen as genius or fool.

Mourinho, as one so well versed, knows the fine margins. Those Champions League defeats against Liverpool came via a disputed Luis Garcia goal and a penalty shootout. To his mind, they are a large reason he has two Champions League wins rather than four.

Perhaps that goes some distance to his explaining his relationship with the club from Anfield. He caused controversy in February 2005 when a Gerrard own goal pulled Chelsea level in the Carling Cup final. Mourinho held his finger to his lips, an apparent taunt towards the Liverpool fans though later explained as a message to the press. Whatever the motive, Mourinho was sent off as Chelsea won 3-2.

Mourinho’s career is littered with such clashes of personality. With Rodgers, the relationship has remained good and affectionate, even if there have been barbs since the dynamic changed and they became rivals.

Last season, after Gerrard’s slip, Rodgers accused Chelsea of 'parking two buses' and said it was 'not difficult' to coach a team to defend. It was unsporting from a decent man and Mourinho wasn’t impressed. The Portuguese took a minor swipe this week at Rodgers’ selection to face Madrid.

Reflecting on April's win, Mourinho said: 'It gave the title to Man City, simple as that. Liverpool, with a point in that match, would have been champions. Without it, they lost the title. It meant nothing to us. After our defeat against Sunderland, that match meant professional pride. We were not in the race.’

And on the rivalry goes. On such sub-plots, the Premier League has always thrived. With Chelsea on an unbeaten season and Rodgers facing significant questions, the table is set for another big meeting.
