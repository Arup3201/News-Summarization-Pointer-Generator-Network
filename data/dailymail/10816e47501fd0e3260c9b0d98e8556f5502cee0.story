First there was the Periodic Table song, then the Cern rap and now the DNA Boogie.

A science teacher from the Midlands has developed a rather unorthodox way of teaching his students about biology - through the medium of dance.

Dr Richard Spencer, a science teacher at Middlesbrough College, in Teeside, choreographed his lessons to music in an attempt to help his pupils remember how a cell works.

Among the dances he has created is the DNA Boogie - in which he uses dance moves to represent the molecules chemical structure - and the Meiosis Square Dance, about how chromosomes are shared between cells as tissue grow.

Musicians who want to write a chart-topping song need to move in a different musical direction than the pack, research has revealed.

More than 25,000 songs on the Billboard 100 from 1958 to 2013 were analysed as part of the study of audio attributes.

It found the key to a hit song was that it should sound different from anything else in the charts, but not so distant that it puts music fans off.

Adele's number one song Someone Like You, Simon and Garfunkle's Bridge Over Trouble Water, and Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, all hit the top spot because they were distinct from other songs around at the time. 

Researchers discovered that songs that faltered in the middle of the Billboard 100 were most likely to sound the same, whilst weird singles failed to make the charts at all.

Dr Spencer's efforts have earned him a place among ten finalists in line for a $1 million (£650,000) award, the Varkey Foundation Global Teaching Prize.

The award is designed to highlight the role teachers play in society.

Mr Spencer said he developed the dances along with songs and role-play as a way to help his pupils understand difficult concepts.

He said: 'I'm inspired by music, I'm inspired by art. If I can find a biology link, I will bring it into the teaching.

'What I love about teaching is the privilege of working with young people, to fire their passion and reciprocate their energy.

'The opportunity to be creative and think of different ways of communicating science and the buzz of seeing those "light bulb" moments when challenging topics start to make sense for students and you realise that hours of planning innovative learning experiences were worthwhile.

'Finally, seeing my students develop in confidence and knowing that I have helped to prepare them for future success, way beyond their time with me in the classroom.'

Dr Spencer has also produced detailed step by step guides to his dances to help other teachers use them in their lessons.

The Meiosis Square Dance, for example, aims to convey the biological process of cell division, where cells in growing tissue divide into daughter cells with the same genetic material.

In the dance he gives the pupils different coloured bibs to represent chromosomes while they hold curtain ties to represent the centromeres that bind matching pairs of chromosomes together.

He also uses different coloured bibs to represent the different chemical building blocks that make up DNA, while also designating different moves to the different parts of each of these nucleotides.

For example a fist pump represents the phosphate that sits at the top of each nucleotide, a body wiggle is the sugar and a point towards the floor is the base.

It is all performed to the music of Blame it on the Boogie.

Dr Spencer will fly to Dubai for the final award ceremony for the Global Teaching Award on Sunday.

The winner will be judged by a panel including Kevin Spacey, Baroness Martha Lane Fox, social activist Geoffrey Canada, Carina Wong, the deputy director of the Bill and Melinda GatesFoundation, and Wendy Kopp, chief executive of Teach for all.

Zoe Lewis, principal at Middlesbrough College, said: 'He has fantastic results at A level and AS level.

'But he is not just a good teacher of students but he is a great teacher of teachers. It's that buzz, vibrancy and enthusiasm he has created here that makes him really special.'
