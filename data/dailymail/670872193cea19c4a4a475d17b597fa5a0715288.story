Porn star: Lisa Bell, pictured, who made extra money by posting racy photographs of herself online, could face jail time after being convicted

A porn star and her mother stole more than £500,000 from a 91-year-old widow by 'grossly' overcharging her for her care, which they were not qualified to give.

Lisa Bell, 30, and her 57-year-old mother Wendy Bell could now face jail time after they were convicted of plotting to defraud Audrey Hammond, who suffers from Parkinson's disease.

Wendy Bell and another woman, Amanda Carroll - who pleaded guilty to fraud charges at an earlier hearing - scammed Mrs Hammond after setting out to 'milk' her of every penny they could.

They charged up to £121 an hour for round-the-clock care, roping in friends and family to help and taking over Mrs Hammond’s Grade II-listed home in a Yorkshire village.

They even ran a burger van business from the property, Bradford Crown Court heard.

Computers were bought for staff, carpets were damaged, and expensive cars parked outside.

Lisa Bell, from Cullingworth, West Yorkshire, once arrived late for a morning shift in a BMW, still wearing full make-up, a mini-skirt and high heels.  

Another time she was found sleeping as she sunbathed while on duty, the court heard.

She told police that she supplemented her income as a carer by running a private porn website. 

The site charges visitors more than £20 a month to view racy photos and videos of Lisa Bell either naked or in lingerie.

Mrs Hammond’s late husband amassed a ‘considerable fortune’ in his coal merchant business and left her land and fishing rights in the Yorkshire Dales.

But the carers siphoned off hundreds of thousands by overcharging, putting in fake petty cash claims and claiming for ‘ghost’ workers.

Wendy Bell and Carroll ‘thought they were utterly untouchable’ and used a number of bank accounts for ‘money laundering on a substantial scale’, said prosecutor Stephen Wood. 

Mr Wood previously told the court the case ‘is all about greed’. 

He added: ‘These defendants … breached the trust reposed in them to simply milk from that lady over half a million pounds by grossly over-claiming for work.

‘Mrs Hammond was subjected to a cruel and heartless fraud.’

Mrs Hammond was diagnosed with debilitating Parkinson’s some years ago. She gave power of attorney to her solicitor, Myron Handzij, allowing him to write cheques on her behalf.

She was initially cared for by her niece Anne Murgatroyd, a retired nurse. Wendy Bell was hired via a care agency to help.

In 2006, Mrs Murgatroyd fell ill and Mrs Hammond hired Bell and the others full-time at £8 an hour, paying them directly to avoid giving the agency a cut.

Wendy Bell took a lead role in arranging the cover, the court heard. Mr Handzij was then asked to pay the inflated wages.

‘All requests for payment were met, regrettably it seems without question,’ Mr Wood said.

Not one of the carers Wendy Bell recruited was qualified to look after a Parkinson’s patient.

None of them had a contract, were legally registered, had any Criminal Records Bureau checks done or paid tax on their wages.

When a qualified carer, Vanessa Ingham, did a shift at the house, she was shocked to find no care plan or medication chart.

In one year, Wendy Bell earned £54,600, while Carroll’s £75,600 pay was at a rate of £121 an hour. 

When police first investigated in September 2012, the group were charging Mrs Hammond £35,000 a month. That fell to £20,000 as soon as an agency took over.

Wendy and Lisa Bell, who were both charged with conspiracy to defraud, showed no emotion as the foreman announced the guilty verdicts. 

Helen Banks, 42, of Riddlesden, West Yorkshire, was cleared at Bradford Crown Court of conspiracy to defraud Mrs Hammond.  

Judge Colin Burn told Wendy Bell, who was also found guilty of one charge of fraud, that a jail sentence was 'absolutely unavoidable'.

He said: 'You have both been convicted by the jury at the end of this lengthy trail of these serious matters.

'Particularly in your case Wendy Bell, by virtue of the amounts involved, a custodial sentence is absolutely unavoidable.' 

Carroll, 44, of Shipley, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud and one charge of conspiracy to defraud at an earlier hearing.

Linda Mynott, 60, Caron Gilbert, 33, and Alice Barker, 59, all from Keighley, West Yorkshire, all admitted conspiracy to defraud.

All the defendants will be sentenced at Bradford Crown Court on February 13.
