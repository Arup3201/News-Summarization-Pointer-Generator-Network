The mother of  ‘Cannibal Cop’ Gilberto Valle has broken her silence to defend her son.

Speaking to Mail Online from her home 
in New York Mrs Elizabeth Valle, 57, was adamant that her son is 
innocent and that he will be publicly exonerated.

She said: ‘My son is not what they are saying he is. He’s been made out to be a monster. My son is not a monster’.

Standing by him: Elizabeth Valle, pictured with her son Gilberto, has defended him against allegations that he planned to kidnap, rape and cook at least 100 women

Not the 'thing' that he has been depicted as: Valle is being held without bail but his mother insists his trial will prove him innocent

Looking tired and anxious Mrs Valle admitted: ‘It is a difficult time but we’re holding up okay.

‘It gives me great strength knowing that when the truth comes out my son will be okay.’

Mrs Valle said that she has been advised by her son’s attorney not to discuss any details of the case which goes to trial on 22 January. But she reiterated that when it does, ‘the truth will show what he really is and it’s not this… thing, people are saying’.

‘My son will be fine,’ she said. ‘That’s all I can say right now’.

It is not clear whether Mrs Valle has had any contact with her daughter-in-law, Kathleen, 28.

It was Kathleen Cooke Mangan who tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing Valle’s plans to abduct, rape, cook and consume 100 female victims.

Valle plead not guilty to all charges including illegally accessing the National Criminal Database to search out potential victims.

He has been held without bail and if convicted faces life imprisonment.

In a particularly chilling section of the internet transcripts read out in Manhattan Federal Court during his bail hearing on Tuesday, Valle shared his hunger for ‘girl meat’ this Thanksgiving in an email exchange with a co-conspirator who has so far remained un-named.

Gilberto and his estranged wife Kathleen Cooke Mangan, 28. It was Kathleen's discoveries on Valle's computer that led FBI agents to her husband

Files found on Valle’s computer included one titled: ‘Abducting and Cooking Victim I: A Blueprint’. It listed materials required including chloroform and rope as well as chronicling the practicalities of fitting a victim into an oven – her legs, he noted, would have to be bent.

Valle also expressed a desire to cook one particular victim slowly – ‘tying her onto some form of apparatus’ and trying to ‘keep her alive as long as possible’.

His defence maintain these were nothing but fantasies and have pointed out that no women were hurt though among his ‘victims’ Valle named women whom the FBI have established did indeed know Valle.

Two of them claim to have been ‘stalked in an intimidating way’ by the police officer who served in Harlem for six years.

Valle and Kathleen, a grade school teacher from Reno, Nevada had been married less than two years when she made the shocking discoveries that lead her to report her husband’s internet communications to the FBI last October.

She has since left the marital home in Queens and taken the couple’s infant daughter, born last October, to her family home in Nevada.

She has declined to comment.

Not guilty: Valle, 28, is seen in this courtroom sketch last month with his public defender Julia Gatto, center, after pleading not guilty to criminal charges

Harrowing: He allegedly discussed how to kill a woman by slowly cooking her over emails with co-conspirators

Shock: Valle's brother arrived at the apartment to collect his dog and was swarmed by reporters

Valle has been charged with kidnapping, conspiracy and unauthorized use of law enforcement records.

'The allegations in the complaint 
really need no description from us,' Mary E Galligan, the FBI acting
assistant director, said in a statement. 'They speak for themselves. It
would be an understatement merely to say Valle’s own words and actions 
were shocking.'

NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly called the case 'bizarre' in a statement.

He added: 'We
suspended the officer immediately upon his arrest, and a review is now 
underway to determine whether there was anything in his background that 
should have alerted the department to his alleged proclivities.'

Scene: FBI searched his apartment in Forest Hills, Queens (pictured) and allegedly found lists of women on his home computer. One file was named: 'Abducting and Cooking [victim's name]: A Blueprint'

Workplace: A police officer stands guard outside the 26th precinct where Valle worked. He allegedly used law enforcement databases to conduct surveillance on potential victims
