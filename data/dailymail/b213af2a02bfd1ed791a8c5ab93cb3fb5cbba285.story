A humanist celebrant stunned mourners as they attended the funeral of a father who died in a car crash with a eulogy detailing his life of crime.

Martin Wilson, 26, was killed alongside his friend James Morgan, 20, after the car they were in lost control and 
ploughed into a garden on November 18.

Hundreds of family and friends 
attended Martin's funeral last week but were left speechless when Donna 
Lear, who led the service, outlined his catalogue of crimes.

In a 30 minute eulogy, Ms Lear, a humanist celebrant, told the congregation how Martin left a 'trail of destruction in his wake and more than a few bloodied noses.'

She also told the congregation how Martin, nicknamed 'Wils' by pals, had his 'fifteen minutes of fame' when he was caught on TV sprinting onto a football pitch and punching the goalkeeper.

Speaking at the funeral at Carmountside Crematorium in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, she told mourners how prison had become 'his second home.'

She said: 'His escapades often landed him in prison - but that was okay because Wils wasn't a big fan of going to work anyway.

'He quite happily organised his life from there - his second home - making even more new friends.'

The bizarre eulogy was greeted with laughter when Ms Lear told how Martin spread 'mayhem' among his friends.

She said: 'Wils was the most loyal and supportive bloke you could ever want to meet - unless you crossed him that is.

'Now he wasn't perfect - who among us is? He didn't shy away from the limelight and was proud of every one of his battle scars - in fact he positively encouraged them

'He would never go to hospital if he was injured but "buzzed of it all" instead.

'Paul remembered the time he came home and was pleased as punch about the fact he'd just been "battered with a barstool".

Police arrived at a vigil held for James Morgan and Martin Wilson

'Football was a big part of his life and Wils was a dedicated Stoke City supporter. He loved the home games but had much more fun at the away ones.

'He was nicked at his first away game and even managed to get his fifteen minutes of fame when a football DVD hosted by Paddy McGuiness showed Wils running onto the pitch and punching an unsuspecting QPR goalkeeper.

'Wils loved to pop over to his mum and Paul's where he would hijack the computer and spend all day on Facebook, getting up only to work his way through every morsel of food in the house like a one man plague of locusts.'

Friends and family of the two men who died released a lantern and held a vigil in remembrance of the car crash victims

Martin was killed instantly when the car he was travelling in crash in Lightwood, Stoke-on-Trent, on November 18 just three days before the birth of his second child, son Kaydan.

The service began with Missing You by Puff Daddy and also included a rendition of 'Unconditional Love by Tupac.

A friend said: 'It was probably the most honest, down to earth eulogies I've ever heard and lots of people at the service agreed but it was brilliant and shocking in equal measure.

'Wils was a lad, rough around the edges but anything other than a warts and all eulogy wouldn't have done him justice, he would have been p****** himself from heaven when he heard it.'
