This daredevil photographer is living life on the edge - capturing explosive images from an erupting volcano.

Just feet away from the flowing lava, intrepid explorers Eric Leifer and Tyler Gee daringly stand by in awe of the fiery but spectacular scene on Kilauea's Eastern Flanks.

Ash and 2,000F (1,093 Celsius) lava spews from the volcano as the daring pair get a close-up view of Mother Nature at work.

The incredible snaps were shot by daring Eric, 28, who lives in Hilo, Hawaii, and works as a volcano tour operator.

He said: 'It's pretty hard to relate what it's like being up close to lava - it changes your life.

'It's our world being created right before your feet. 

'It has a similar feeling to watching the ocean pound away at a rugged coastline or laying underneath the stars on a particularly clear night.

'Some of the best nights of my life have been spent staring into this volcano.'

The spectacular blaze illuminates the clear night sky into a kaleidoscope of vivid colours

'Being up close to lava - it changes your life,' Eric says. Pictured: the Puu Oo Vent crater

'It's our world being created at our feet,' the explorer and amateur photographer says

The only thing more beautiful than the crater itself? A star trail glowing above the inferno
