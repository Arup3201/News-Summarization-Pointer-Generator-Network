A school has left parents furious after teachers took dozens of pupils on a forced shopping trip to a shoe store after they arrived for class wearing inappropriate footwear.

Parents were sent a bill for the ‘approved shoes’ despite never having asked the school to buy them.

The school’s bizarre approach at enforcing its strict uniform policy led to about 40 pupils being driven to the shop by teachers.

Staff at BBG Academy in Birkenshaw, West Yorkshire, even managed to secure a ten per cent discount due to the quantity of shoes they purchased.

But angry parents described the school’s uniform policy as ‘ridiculous’. They claim teachers have been placing children in ‘isolation’ for uniform offences and have been lining up girls to inspect their skirts in a ‘military manner’.

Pupils were taken to a branch of Wynsors World of Shoes on separate occasions over two weeks after being deemed to be wearing inappropriate shoes.

Teachers paid £18 for each pair, which parents were then expected to pay at a later stage.

One parent with two children at the school said she thought it was a joke at first. ‘I received a call saying they would take my son for some new shoes and I could pay later,’ she said.

‘The lady I spoke to at the school seemed quite excited at the fact they were getting 10 per cent discount because they had bought so many pairs.’

On its website, BBG Academy sets out its uniform which is says was developed with 'students, staff and governors'.

The uniform was developed to be practical, fashionable and attractive and our students know that conflict over the uniform is inappropriate,' the guidelines say, adding that students should adhere to uniform rules on the way to school, during the school day and on the way home.

Boys must wear a school blazer and tie with a white shirt and dark grey or charcoal trousers. It says boys should wear 'plain black shoes' and that trainers, pumps and canvas shoes are not acceptable.

Girls must also wear a blazer and tie with the same shoe guidelines as boys except that they are allowed to wear low heel shoes or ankle boots with trousers.

Vicca Biggs, 33, whose child is at the school, said that the new uniform policy was ‘undermining parents’. She said: ‘I would be annoyed if one of my kids came back with some shoes and I didn’t know where they came from.’

Mother Diane Coughlan, 46, said: ‘This Monday, they lined all the girls up in an almost military manner and inspected the length of their skirts. They are really clamping down on the poor kids. It’s ridiculous.’

Another parent said: ‘If children don’t have their top button done up, they get put in isolation.’

The school, which has more than 750 pupils, refused to say how many pairs of shoes it had bought but insisted it was providing ‘support’ so pupils could follow rules.

Tanya Ratcliffe, 41, the manager of the shoe store, estimated that 40 pupils had been taken to buy shoes by teachers in the past two weeks.

‘When they came in for the first time I recognised the teacher from BBG so I gave them a 10 per cent discount out of goodwill,’ she said.

‘A lot of parents from the school have come in because they don’t want their kids coming with their teachers in school time.’

She said the shop had sold 60 pairs of ‘approved shoes’ to pupils at the school in the past two weeks.

A supervisor at the store said a teacher had arrived with a group of three pupils on at least two occasions every day last week. School rules state that children must wear ‘plain black shoes’. The BBG Academy was rated inadequate, the lowest possible grade, in its latest Ofsted inspection carried out in October this year. 

The inspection was the school’s first since becoming an academy in 2012. When it was previously inspected as Birkenshaw Middle School it was deemed to be good overall. 

The move is believed to be part of the school’s ‘positive discipline’ programme, introduced as a reaction to the Ofsted report. Staff said it was already having a significant effect on pupils’ behaviour.

School manager Claire Stephenson said: ‘We are supporting some pupils in ensuring they can follow the uniform policy. We wanted all the pupils to be in the correct uniform.

‘We informed parents before doing this and, on the whole, parents have been very supportive of the behavioural system.’
