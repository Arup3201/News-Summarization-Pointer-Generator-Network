Ronald Phillips is a death row inmate who raped and killed a three-year-old girl

An Ohio child killer scheduled for execution in two days has asked that his organs be donated to help his sick mother and sister.

Lawyers for death row inmate Ronald Phillips say in a letter to the Ohio prisons agency that Phillips would also be willing to donate the organs to other individuals.

Phillips' mother has kidney disease and is on dialysis and his sister has a heart condition.

The letter obtained today by The Associated Press says Philips wants as many people as possible to benefit from his death.

A message was left with the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction seeking comment.

The 40-year-old Phillips faces execution on Thursday by a never-tried two-drug combination of a sedative and painkiller.

He was sentenced to die for raping and killing his girlfriend's daughter, three-year-old Sheila Marie Evans, in Akron in 1993.

'Ron is making this generous request 
without any conditions or expectations,' according to the letter 
obtained by The Associated Press.

'He is nonetheless willing to do whatever is necessary to enable as many people as possible to benefit from his death,' the letter continued.

Phillips' request is not a delay tactic, public defender Lisa Lagos said today.

Phillips will be injected with a never before used combination of an intravenous combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller

'Ron just wants to be able to do a 
charitable act and help bring any closure to the victim's family that he
can,' she said in an interview.

The Ohio prisons agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Phillips' request for mercy was denied last week by Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Phillips has dropped all his appeals, Lagos said.

Attorneys
for Phillips note that Ohio has stopped using two drugs that damaged an
inmate's organs - one a paralyzing agent, the other a drug that stops 
the heart.

On Thursday, 
Ohio plans to use midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a 
painkiller. It was not immediately clear today what effect those might 
have on organs.
