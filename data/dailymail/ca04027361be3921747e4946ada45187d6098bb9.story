This breathtaking video captures the moment a cyclist traverses an almost-vertical rock face to conquer the world's most dangerous trail - before making a return journey.

Michal Kollbek was filmed defying gravity as he made his way over the famed White Line in Sedona - a near impossible route carved into a rock in Arizona.

The stunning one-minute clip was filmed using a drone flying overhead and sees Polish rider Kollbek gradually make his way along the path with Red Rock State Park seen in the background.

Death-defying: Daredevil Michal Kollbek rides his bike across the famed White Line in Sedona, in Arizona's Red Rock State Park

The entire clip was shot from a drone that showed how Kollbek went all the way across the rock face, turned, and then came all the way back, completing the  trip  without any problems. 

Kollbek, 30, has had practice with extreme stunts before and the Polish rider has claimed numerous downhill racing titles.

He claimed that he attempted the heart-stopping stunt because he happened to be in the area.

To prepare for the horizontal ride, Kollbeck had to let air out of his tires to maxmimise their grip on the rocky face.

He then adjusted the suspension on the bikes frame and raised his saddle and walked across the route himself to create a mental picture beforehand.

'I live for thrills like this, and I would have tackled this line whether it was filmed or not,' he told the Huffington Post. 

No fear: The 30-year-old Polish cyclist was captured riding across this almost-vertical cliff in a video filmed using a drone 

'The drone was a bonus, and [videographer Marshall Mullen] did a great job capturing the moment. However, it's not for everyone, so I strongly advise inexperienced riders against trying this line.' 

'Conquering this ride was all mental,' he told HuffPost. 'I was confident with my skills and knew I could execute it. The key was to block the out the scary thoughts about the potential danger, so I just focused on the trail and not on the terrifying space around me.' 

Set amid the strikingly beautiful Red Rocks, Sedona is known for its famed arts community.

Nearly 100 art galleries are in the main town and each year the Sedona International Film Festival and Jazz Festival are held in the town.

Besides its bustling bohemian culture, Sedona is also a huge draw for mountain bikers, off-roaders and hikers.

Home to 12,000 people, Sedona is one of the most left-leaning communities in the United States set among 19 square miles of striking red rocks that resemble a Martian landscape.

A 90 minute drive or 100 mile journey away from Phoenix, the twon itself sits 4,500 feet above sea level, with a mixture of mountain and desert climates. 

Many of the residents of Sedona are artistic, spiritual types and the local economy is based around the jaw dropping scenery and nearby Native American ruins.
