Russell Martin is adamant Scotland won’t park the bus against Germany - although the loss of first-choice left-back Andrew Robertson has now left Gordon Strachan with a defensive headache.

The national side open their Euro 2016 qualification campaign with a daunting trip to Dortmund on Sunday evening.

A full house of almost 66,000 is expected inside the Westfalenstadion for the first competitive game played by Joachim Low’s team since they lifted the World Cup in Brazil.

No fear: Scotland's Russell Martin is adamant his nation will not park bus against world champions Germany

Go on a run: The Scotland players will be hoping for a good start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign

Norwich City centre-back Martin recognises that Scotland must bring a perfect defensive game if they are to cope with a multi-faceted German threat.

The chances of that have lessened, however, after the loss of talented Hull City defender Robertson, who was ruled out on Wednesday due to a calf injury.

With Rangers left-back Lee Wallace having been overlooked, the most likely replacement is Norwich’s Steven Whittaker, while Charlie Mulgrew could perhaps move from midfield to cover.

Despite the blow - and the injury to another defender, Christophe Berra - Martin believes head coach Strachan will find a way for the Scots to achieve a result.

‘Every team, even the world champions, will have some weaknesses,’ said Martin.

‘The coaching staff here have spent a long time looking at them and we’ll be working on things on the training pitch.

‘The one thing about the manager and his staff is that they are very thorough in terms of studying teams and trying to exploit weaknesses.

‘We all know how good Germany can be, so let’s look at maybe one or two things they don’t do so well.

‘We won’t just sit in. No chance. I think if you do that against a team of Germany’s quality, you are on a hiding to nothing. It would be a very long evening.

‘We are going to try to impose our own game and play the way we want to play.

‘The manager is really positive, as are the lads. We have improved a lot over the past year, so we want to keep that going. We will have a go to try to get a result.’

Germany gave an awesome example of their attacking power in that incredible 7-1 demolition of Brazil in the World Cup semi-finals.

‘I sat watching that game in disbelief, probably the same as everyone else,’ added Martin.

‘It was the most one-sided game I have ever seen in the World Cup.

‘But one thing we are is extremely organised. Everyone knows exactly what their defensive roles are. We are also getting better in attack.’

Avoiding defeat in Dortmund would be an outstanding start to a Euro 2016 qualification campaign that offers the best chance yet of a first place at a major finals since the France 98 World Cup.

Some of the German players are already uncomfortably familiar to Martin. Mesut Ozil scored twice for Arsenal in a 4-1 win over Norwich last season but the defender is not cowed by the prospect of a re-match.

‘I’ve played against Ozil and Lukas Podolski and they are top players,’ said Martin. ‘Playing against them before is a bit of a help but they have good players all over the pitch. We won’t just focus on one or two.

‘Germany have a lot of pace and power but we are used to that as we played Belgium twice (in the last campaign) and they had that, too.

‘There are still weaknesses and we must exploit that. We have some real strengths and need to be positive.’

Meanwhile, Robertson, who has impressed since his summer switch the English Premier League from Dundee United, took to social media on Wednesday night to express his anguish at missing out on facing the Germans.

Robertson, who expects to be fit for Hull’s next league match at home on September 15, tweeted: ‘Gutted to be injured but hopefully back for West Ham! Good luck to all the boys.’
