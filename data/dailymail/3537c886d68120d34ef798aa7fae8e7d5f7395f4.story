Police are investigating whether three super-fit soldiers who collapsed and died on an SAS endurance march earlier this year had consumed a potentially fatal cocktail of performance-enhancing drugs.

Corporal James Dunsby, 31, Trooper Edward Maher, 31 and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, died in July after a 20-mile march in extremely hot conditions in the Brecon Beacons, South Wales.

Last night, Kelvin Roberts, 53, the father of L/Cpl Roberts, confirmed that police believe doping could have played a part in the deaths.

Dyfed Powys police have questioned recruits from the soldiers’ Army Reserve regiments on their use of substances such as ephedrine, a restricted substance with similar effects to the Class B drug amphetamine, as well as body-building supplements and energy drinks. Further tests have been ordered after post-mortem examinations failed to find a cause of death.

Asked if his family had been told L/Cpl Roberts might have used stimulants before the march, Mr Roberts said: ‘Yes, we are aware of something like that but I don’t want to say any more at the moment.’

The potential doping link to the deaths of the SAS recruits comes one month after the Army’s biggest-ever performance-enhancing drugs scandal.

As The Mail on Sunday revealed, 17 members of the 7th Parachute Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, were caught using ephedrine. They have been kicked out of the Army.

Soldiers interviewed by police have suggested that doping was taking place inside the SAS. They have also described how a ‘muscle culture’ inside the regiment might have influenced how soldiers prepared for ‘Selection’ – a series of gruelling marches.

A source said: ‘The police are asking what they took before the march and what the guys who lost their lives might have taken. On the course everyone was looking for a competitive advantage.

‘There was some honesty in the wake of what happened because some good blokes died. There were also some deep discussions at the funerals which resulted in information being passed to the police.

‘Whatever supplement you take there’s a danger. On a hot day in the hills a soldier will be in a lot of trouble. After taking supplements he’ll perspire faster, drink his water ration sooner, and once this runs out he’ll be in big trouble.’

Cpl Dunsby, Tpr Maher and L/Cpl Roberts, who had all served in Afghanistan or Iraq, were hoping to get into the reservist regiment 21 SAS.

They set off at 6am on July 13 towards Pen y Fan – the highest point in southern Britain. In the afternoon, as temperatures rose to more than 30C (86F), the soldiers ran out of water.  

L/Cpl Roberts was declared dead on the mountain while  Tpr Maher was declared dead that evening. Cpl Dunsby suffered multiple organ failure and died in hospital a fortnight later. Their deaths constituted the biggest loss of life in the history of SAS Selection. Three other soldiers received treatment at the scene for heatstroke.

Last night, sports and exercise medicine consultant Dr Richard Weiler said: ‘Ephedrine is a stimulant. Its danger level depends on the dosage but it is not great to take in combination with the other factors on that day.

‘A very high caffeine intake would have left the men dehydrated and agitated.’

Defence sources named two high-caffeine products popular among soldiers – Smart Burner and Ripped Freak – which are available in specialist sports shops. The Powys coroner’s office, the police and the MoD declined to comment.
