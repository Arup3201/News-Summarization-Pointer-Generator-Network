Hibs head coach Alan Stubbs insists he’s confident he won’t be plunged into a goalkeeping crisis ahead of Sunday’s crunch derby with Hearts at Easter Road.

Hull boss Steve Bruce has said the Tigers might have to recall shot-stopper Mark Oxley from his six-month loan in Leith after Steve Harper suffered an arm injury in Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Arsenal.

Bruce is already without Allan McGregor who is not expected to return until next month with a shoulder problem. Speaking after the match at the Emirates, Bruce said: ‘We have a goalkeeper at Hibernian so maybe on Monday we will probably have to call him back.’

But Stubbs reckons the English Premier League side can only recall Oxley, who has played in all of Hibs’ games this season, during a transfer window. 

‘He can’t do it until January so that’s not something to worry about just now,’ said the head coach, who only has untried 19-year-old goalkeeper Kleton Perntreou as back-up.

Meanwhile, on-loan Celtic playmaker Dylan McGeouch insists Hibs can use the visit of Hearts to launch themselves back into title contention.

McGeouch helped Stubbs’ side rack up a 4-0 victory at Livingston on Saturday that propelled them into the play-off slot for the first time since the opening week of the season.

A League Cup win over Ross County and stunning triumph at Ibrox are part of a five-game unbeaten run that has lifted the mood ahead of the Edinburgh showdown.

‘We’re confident for next week and hopefully we can get a good result as well and push on for the top of the league,’ he said. ‘It hasn’t been the best of starts but we’re starting to put performances in and get the results now. We’re unbeaten in five but we need to start getting three points like we did on Saturday.’

Hearts are 14 points clear of fourth-placed Hibs but McGeouch, who added the third goal from the penalty spot, insists the gap is not insurmountable.

‘A win would definitely give us a boost in terms of trying to catch Hearts. If we can get closer to them and put in a wee challenge it would be great and good for Scottish football.’

Hibs went ahead after 31 minutes with a helping hand from Lions goalkeeper Darren Jamieson.

The shot-stopper spilled David Gray’s cross and Dominique Malonga pounced on the rebound.

Jason Cummings then set up Danny Handling with a clever flick and he swept a drive into the corner of the net after 53 minutes.

McGeouch scored the third with a cool penalty after Cummings was tripped by Craig Sives before sub Paul Heffernan completed the rout.

Livingston boss John McGlynn, whose side now sit bottom on goal difference, said: ‘It’s a sore one but the best team won. Hibs are a better side than their league position has shown.’
