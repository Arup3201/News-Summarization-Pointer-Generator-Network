The zebra is the pet of Derrick's father, police say. 

Court clerk Misty Perkins said the judge suffered eye and arm injuries.

Derrick is hospitalized at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock.

Police wouldn't elaborate on the attack.

They also provided no explanation as to why the family owned a zebra.

However police said they are not considering criminal charges because the incident involved an animal that was legally owned.
