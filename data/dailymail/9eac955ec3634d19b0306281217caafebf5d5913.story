Two men escaped certain death this morning after crashing into the barrier on a bridge, leaving them teetering 50ft above a busy motorway. 

It is believed the driver skidded on a wet section of the M25 ,at J5, near Sevenoaks, before his vehicle became wedged on the barrier. 

Half of the Renault remained on the motorway, while the other half dangled over the M26 below.

Two men were lucky to survive today after crashing into a barrier on a motorway over bridge on the M25, leaving the car teetering 50ft over the M26 below

The car smashed through the barrier, but one of the railings wedged under the rare axle and above the front wheel, which stopped it from falling onto the M26

Police said the men suffered only 'cuts and bruises' in the accident which caused parts of the motorway, and parts of the M26 east-bound, to be closed.

The crash caused large tailbacks as officers at the Highway Agency removed the car and carried out emergency repairs on the barrier.

The Kent Road Policing unit later used the accident as an example of what can happen in wet conditions.

In this Highway Agency still, the car can be seen straddling the barrier as rescuers, left, go to their aid

Highway Agency staff cleared the car from the scene and emergency repairs were made to the barrier

They tweeted: 'Crash from M25 Jct 5 earlier this morning. Car nearly fell down onto M26 below.

'Two occupants received cuts and bruises only. Please remember this as the danger of driving on a wet road.'
