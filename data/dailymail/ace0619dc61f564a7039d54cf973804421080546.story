A blind man has been investigated for benefit fraud after he scored a 180 in a charity darts event and was deemed to be too good to be blind.

Visually impaired Robert Boon, 50, from Paignton, Devon was stunned to discover a member of the public had reported him to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) - claiming someone that good at darts could not possibly be blind.

'Everything went OK. Then I got a letter from the DWP,' he explained.

Mr Boon felt moved to raise the money for charity in memory of his recently deceased friends. A user of a guide dog himself, he knew how important they could be for individuals with impaired sight

Mr. Boon, who is registered blind as he is completely blind in one eye and only able to see shadows in the other, said: 'I rang them up because I couldn't read it, and they explained to me that someone had reported me because of the dart marathon.

'There were loads of people there, so it could have been someone at the event.

'I felt humiliated because I don't think it is right to report me when I have tried to do something good.

'I rang the hospital to get my medical records on my eye condition. I don't see why people should put me down.

'I feel really intimidated now. I am registered blind and can't see virtually anything out of one eye and shadows in the other.

The DWP have confirmed that after an investigation it does not intent to cut Robert's benefits.

Mr. Boom organised a ten-hour darts marathon to raise funds for the £10,000 training of two guide dogs who he wanted to name Mary and Wesley after his recently deceased friends.

Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some accuracy

He scored 61,000 points and a maximum 180 with three darts. He played the game when he was younger

Having played darts for fun before he lost his sight, Robert decided the event was the best way to raise the cash. 

Throughout the day held at the Pond Coffee Shop in Paignton, Robert racked up 61,000 points and at one point a maximum 180 with three darts. 

Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some degree of accuracy.

Mr. Boon stood his ground with the DWP but said he felt humiliated and intimidated by being accused of fraud

Mr. Boon felt the whole episode was unfair, especially considering he was trying to help people like him

He stepped up to the oche at 10am, and was throwing darts all day, with a five minute rest every hour, until nearly 9pm.

Robert said: 'I've always had bad eyesight, I was never allowed to drive or even play football. The only sports I was allowed to do was judo or darts.

'Two of my friends passed away recently and I wanted to name guide dogs after them, so that their names could live on.

'I was watching TV a while back and saw a blind darts team, so I decided to give it a go. 

'I knew the layout of the board, when you've been playing for ten hours straight you start to get a gauge for where things are on the board.

The DWP have confirmed that after an investigation it does not intent to cut Robert's benefits

A spokesman for the Deparment for Work and Pensions said: 'It's only right that we investigate a person's benefit claim when we receive information that suggests they may not be entitled.'

Mr Boon worked in the hotel business until he was diagnosed blind three years ago. He is married to his wife Donna, 52. and has one child by a previous relationship, Lauren, 11.

He has said he will continue in his efforts to raise money for guide dog training, despite recent events.

However, Robert said he had questioned whether he should go on after he received the letter from the DWP, theTorquay Herald Express reported.

Because of the impact of the day and the support he received, Mr. Boon decided to continue supporting his cause.

'I have a guide dog myself and I wanted to show people how important the guide dogs can be,' he said when first organising the event.
