Leaked documents detailing that a wealthy property developer embroiled in a bitter divorce battle apparently transferred millions of pounds to an offshore bank account have been revealed.

A leak of bank records from the British Virgin Islands reportedly show that Scot Young, who was jailed in January for failing to disclose to his estranged wife where his vast wealth had gone, transferred large sums to six companies on the Caribbean island.

According to the Evening Standard, the documents show that transactions were made to move the money to another tax haven island.

Bitter battle: Scot Young, pictured (left) with his fashion designer girlfriend Noelle Reno, is embroiled in a High Court divorce case with estranged wife Michelle, right.

The funds are said to include around £65million meant for a Moscow property development.

The tycoon had claimed that he had lost his vast wealth - estimated at around £400million at one stage - after the Moscow development did not come off.

But the leak will raise question marks over that claim when a High Court divorce battle with estranged wife Michelle resumes later this year.

Mrs Young has claimed that her estranged husband's failure to pay court ordered maintenance of £27,500 a month has left her broke.

Meanwhile, the 48-year-old also claims that her former husband has £2billion in assets stashed overseas and continued to live a lifestyle of 'considerable wealth' despite apparently having been left penniless.

But Mr Young, whose girlfriend is fashion designer Noelle Reno, 29, was jailed for six months after he failed to provide proof to the High Court that his wealth had diminished.

Mrs Young told the Evening Standard after today's revelations: 'This is proof, if it were even needed, that he has no respect for the law whatsoever, this is the proof he has been lying all along.

'People like Scot, people with wealth and power, believe that the rules do not apply to them.'

Information disclosed by the Guardian and US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists details the financial dealings of a number of high profile businessmen and politicians.

The records allegedly show that Mr Young transferred power of attorney for a Cypriot firm that managed his Moscow investment and that the Cypriot investments were switched to six companies based in the British Virgin islands and then moved onto the a trust fund on the island of Nevis.
