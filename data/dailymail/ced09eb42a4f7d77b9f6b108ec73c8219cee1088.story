Alex Salmond ripped off the gloves and came out swinging in last night’s debate – landing crucial blows on the NHS, North Sea oil and most-important of all: the pound.

The First Minister had been left reeling by Alistair Darling’s questions over currency in the first debate earlier this month. But Mr Salmond left nothing to chance last night – setting out ‘three plan Bs for the price of one’ while lambasting the 'No' campaign's negativity.

Here MailOnline recaps the four crucial moments from last night's second and final live TV debate before the Setember 18 poll.

The First Minister wrong-footed Alistair Darling by mentioning 'three plan Bs' instead of using the pound

The First Minister insisted it was in the best interests of Scotland to enter into a currency union with the rest of the UK - sharing the pound and all Britain's debts.

But won applause after reiterating his threat that if Westminster stopped Scotland sharing the pound, Edinburgh would not take its fair share of the debt.

Crucially, he also wrong-footed the former Labour Chancellor after finally admitting Scotland could use alternative currencies to the pound.

He ‘set out the options to point out there are other things we could do’, highlighting a flexible currency union such as Sweden and Norway's and the fixed exchange rate that Denmark and Hong Kong share. But Mr Salmond then added: ‘We cannot be stopped from using the pound anyway.’

The SNP leader claimed the biggest revelation from last night’s debate was Mr Darling’s admission that Scotland could use the pound if it wanted and there was nothing Westminster could do about it.

But Mr Darling said this would leave Scotland having to get its books signed off by London – much like Eurozone countries now have their accounts audited by Brussels.

He said: ‘Of course we can use the pound... we could use the rouble, we could use the dollar, we could use the yen. We could use anything we want.’

Mr Salmond said: ‘The key point we have heard tonight is that Alistair admitted a few seconds ago we could use the pound anyway. We didn't need permission.

‘Totally different from what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said a few months ago, when he said “If you walk out of the UK, you walk out of the pound”.

‘Remember that, we have heard it tonight. They cannot stop us using the pound - the most important revelation of this debate.’

But closing the debate Mr Darling insisted that uncertainty over currency could ‘bring a country to its knees’.

The former chancellor said: ‘I know there are some who are thinking about giving independence a chance, but when we can't be told about currency, I don't think that can be trusted.’

Mr Salmond (right) managed to neutralise Mr Darling's attacks on what currency an independent Scotland would use

During the televised debate Mr Darling accused the pro-independence campaign of scaremongering on the future of the NHS with claims that a Yes vote is needed to protect the health service north of the border from privatisation under the Tories.

Mr Darling said: ‘What we need is less of that scaremongering and a realisation we all want the NHS to do well, we all want it to be there at the point of need, but to do that you need funding.

'Frankly taking on risks, not even knowing what currency you've got, is the real threat to the National Health Service.'

But Mr Salmond landed crucial blows over the risk to Scotland’s public services of remaining in the UK, which could be run from London by the English-dominated Conservative party.

He insisted that spending cuts south of the border could hurt the health service in Scotland if the referendum resulted in a No vote

He said: ‘That is why, to have a health service we can all trust and rely on, we've got to have a health service where we have financial control as well as policy control, so we can keep the National Health Service as the greatest public institution in Scotland.’

Mr Salmond also went on the attack over ‘ludicrous’ welfare cuts being pushed through in Westminster, singling out the ‘bedroom tax’ for particular abuse.

The SNP accused Mr Darling of being ‘in bed with the Tory Party’ over welfare reforms - with this denied by the Better Together leader, who argued that it made sense to spread the cost of providing social security across all of the UK.

Mr Darling said: 'We know there are people with disabilities, we know we've got an ageing population that will require more medical care, we know we've got a falling working age population. 

'Why take that burden on five million people when it could be pooled and shared across 63 million? It makes no sense whatsoever.’

But the First Minister said 100,000 disabled people in Scotland were being hit by the UK Government's welfare cuts. 

He acknowledged these were difficult times but ‘you don't take it out on the disabled, you don't take it out on families with children’. 

He also hit out at the ‘bedroom tax’ removal of the spare room subsidy for social tenants, calling it ‘the most ludicrous tax of all time’. 

Mr Darling was left reeling by his SNP rival's aggressive tactics

The former Labour Chancellor warned against being too reliant on North Sea oil after independence - but was ridiculed by Mr Salmond who said countries like Norway were doing fine on their own.

Mr Darling said the SNP was wildly over-optimistic about how much oil was left in the North Sea and said Scotland was gambling on the ‘volatile and uncertain’ revenue from the fuel for around 15 per cent of its income. 

He added: ‘Once it's gone, it's gone.’

But Mr Salmond said North Sea oil and gas ‘will be with us way beyond 2050’. He said ‘every other country in Europe would give their eye teeth’ to have the resource.

'The key point we have heard tonight is that Alistair admitted a few seconds ago we could use the pound anyway. We didn't need permission.'

'This is our time, our moment, let's seize it with both hands.'

The bedroom tax 'must be the most ludicrous tax of all time'.

'Every other country in Europe would give their back teeth to have North Sea Oil.'

'No-one will run this country better than the people who live and work in Scotland.'
