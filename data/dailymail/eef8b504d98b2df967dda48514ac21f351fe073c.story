Calin-Lonel Rostas has been sentenced to twenty months in prison for stealing phones

A Romanian pickpocket who duped coffee shop customers by using sheets of lined paper as a 'shield' while he stole their phones was behind bars today.

Calin-Lonel Rostas, 27, would trawl cafes and whenever he spotted a mobile phone left on table would put a A4 size piece of paper over it.

He then distracted the owners of the phones by chatting them momentarily about the weather before using his light fingers to sneak the handsets into his pocket as he picked up his piece of paper.

Victims only realised their phones were missing after Rostas left the cafe following his 'gone in five seconds' distraction thefts.

Rostas got away with at least 15 mobile phones worth £6,000, but was caught after police trawled through hours of CCTV footage at coffee shops in Manchester including Starbucks, Costa Coffee, Cafe Nero and two cafes in the city’s university district.

When he was caught it emerged he had just been released from jail for a similar scam.

Today Romanian-born Rostas, now living in Crumpsall, Manchester was jailed for 20 months.

He pleaded guilty to 15 thefts and five attempted thefts, involving four mobile phones and an iPad and was said to have a history of carrying out 13 cons dating back to 2002.

Manchester Crown Court was told Rostas targeted coffee shops and takeaway restaurants in Manchester city centre and south Manchester between December last year and February.

In most cases Rostas would distract his victims by placing a paper over their mobile and then begin talking to them. He would then leave, taking his paper and the victim's mobile phone

He was eventually arrested after he tried to dupe students sat drinking coffee outside McDonalds on Oxford Road. In statements given to police, victims were said to have been left 'scared and upset.'

One woman became distrusting, others blamed themselves and one victim suffered university exam disruption as a result of the theft.

Some of the pieces of paper Rostas used had writing of them, and he also used leaflets and posed as a beggar asking for cash. Rostas said he sold the phones to cover gambling debts. The handsets have never been recovered.

Police have revealed reports of similar thefts involving the same trick across Greater Manchester, with one similar theft being recently reported at a pub in Prestwich, near Bury.

Passing sentence the Judge Miss Recorder Rowena Goode said; 'These thefts were planned and co-ordinated. No soon as you are released from prison you go out and commit exactly the same offences again.

'Your pattern of offending seems to demonstrates that you have no intention whatsoever to alter your views.'

Police said Rostas was seen with two men on a number of occasions and officers have how issued CCTV stills of the two suspects.

After the case Det Chief Insp Colin Larkin, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Rostas is a skilled fraudster who is well versed in deception, he managed to con 15 victims and stole their mobile phones.

'He has been sentenced to 20 months in prison, on a number of occasions he was seen with two other men. If you recognise either of the men please get in touch as soon as possible.

'While it should be safe for us all to put our phones and other belongings next to us on a table while we enjoy a drink or bite to eat, the reality is that there are people out there looking to take advantage of those less security conscious than others.

'It only takes seconds for them to strike and they are gone before you even realise your treasured possession is missing.

'There are some simple steps people can take to prevent them from falling victim to this type of crime and I want to get these messages into the public’s psyche.

'Quite simply, be aware of your surroundings and keep your possessions safe - don’t leave them lying around.'
