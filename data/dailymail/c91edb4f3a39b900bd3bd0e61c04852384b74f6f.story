New Zealand's All Blacks rugby team has been intimidating rivals with the traditional Maori haka for generations, but this kid just makes it look cute.

Filmed prior to the side's four nation's ruby union fixture against Argentina, the young fan stands close to the television as his country's famous rugby side prepares to perform the tribal challenge. 

In a crouch-like pose, he rises with the crowd   flailing his arms and thumping his legs before striking his forearms in a convincing display of support for the world's most formidable rugby side.

The flailing arms and leg thumping action is as close to the real thing as this young boy gets

His support may well have just been the impetus the All Blacks need to thump Argentina 29-8

And while his timing might be slightly out of sync, the eager fan displays all the hallmark moves adopted by the All Blacks during the pre-game performance. 

Predominantly associated with international rugby matches, the haka has also  found its way into New Zealand's basketball sporting landscape.

Two videos   showcasing the  island nation's paralympic basketball team and the New Zealand Tall Blacks at the Invictus Games and the World Cup respectively went viral.

Opponents of both sides were left bewildered when the basketballers suddenly broke-out into the traditional dance, hitting their wheelchairs and striking their limbs while chanting the Maori cry.

In the Tall Blacks match against the US, the dream team was in the middle of their warm up for the big game when the Kiwi side got down to business with the pre-match routine.

The psyche-out technique didn't work as well as did for their rugby counterparts, however, and the side was thumped 98-71.

The Haka - which dates back to the 1880s - is best described as a traditional Maori dance which is performed in the form of ancestral war cries, choreographed movements, face-pulling and dancing.

It is also performed to mark special occasions, as a welcome greeting, or to acknowledge remarkable achievements.

Perhaps more than any aspect of Maori culture, this complex dance is an expression of the passion, vigour and identity of the race.  

But the ferocity of the haka has not always been as intimidating as its current-day version.

Rather than tribal posturing it came across as just a bunch of white males dancing badly - which is perhaps best expressed in a video circulating from a match between the All Blacks and the Barbarians in 1973.

The strangely choreographed version, featuring the all-white All Blacks squad, has been labelled one of the worst performances of all time.

But 30 years on and the haka is a much more fierce display as players stand in the face of their opponents and gesture in a throat-slitting motion at the completion of the routine.

It is essentially performed to give players an edge over their opponents before taking the field.
