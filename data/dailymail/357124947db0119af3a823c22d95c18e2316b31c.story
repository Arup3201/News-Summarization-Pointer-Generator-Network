Bill Worthington, of Bredbury, Greater Manchester, has pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to a squirrel. The 75-year-old trapped it and shot it with his air rifle, but it did not die immediately

After watching it raid his garden bird table once too often, Bill Worthington decided enough was enough.

The retired civil servant set a trap for his bushy-tailed foe and lay in wait.

It didn’t take long for the grey squirrel to take the bait and, with the animal cornered in the make-shift cage, the 75-year-old from Stockport, Greater Manchester, shot it twice with his air rifle.

He went shopping but, when he returned two hours later, the animal was still alive so he shot it a further three times.

Yesterday it emerged Worthington  is facing up to six months in jail or a £5,000 fine after being hauled before the courts for causing unnecessary suffering to the squirrel.

The keen crown green bowler and bird lover was reported to the RSPCA by a neighbour who spotted the animal, maimed, but still alive in his garden.

The five shots failed to kill the animal and it was later put down.

Worthington pleaded guilty but told the hearing he had been ‘provoked’ by the activities of the squirrels, which he described as ‘garden rats’ and ‘vermin’.

Speaking afterwards, he said: ‘I cannot believe I have been taken to court over this one grey squirrel, which, frankly, has been a pest and vermin. It does seem over the top.

‘I just wanted to keep my garden nice and feed the birds, yet these squirrels kept coming in and taking all the food.

‘They seem to wait in the trees until I’m not in the garden before striking. They dig up my garden and they eat the bird feed. In my mind they are a real problem.

‘I don’t want people to think I don’t like animals – far from it. I used to work on a farm years ago and I have a budgie called Peter who is marvellous, so clever.’

Claire Aldridge, prosecuting, told Stockport Magistrates’ Court that the RSPCA was alerted on September 27 last year by a neighbour who had spotted the injured squirrel in the garden of Worthington’s home, in Bredbury.

She said: ‘The squirrel had been trapped in a cage in the defendant’s garden. Worthington took his .22 air rifle and shot at it two times.

When interviewed by the RSPCA Worthington referred to squirrels as 'vermin' and 'garden rats'

'The defendant went shopping at approximately 11am and left the squirrel in the trap.

'Later when he returned, it was still grabbing at the cage and biting it.

'So the defendant shot the squirrel a further three times at around 2:30pm. He left the squirrel in the trap and went out.’

Worthington, who left to visit his sick wife in a care home, said he assumed the animal was dead, but when the RSPCA arrived at 4.20pm it was still alive.

‘The RSPCA recovered a live squirrel in the middle of the defendant’s garden,’ Miss Aldridge said.

‘This defendant shot a squirrel five times over five hours. He said he didn’t care about the suffering of the animal. The method of dispatch should be carried out humanely.

'What he did was unacceptably cruel and entirely unnecessary. He found it comical that the RSPCA were even investigating.’

Lee Strap, the vet who eventually put down the animal, confirmed it had multiple pellet wounds and was alive but unresponsive.

When questioned by RSPCA officers Worthington was described as ‘obtrusive’.

He confirmed he was a user of a .22 rifle and referred to the squirrels as ‘vermin’ and ‘garden rats’.

Worthington, defending himself, added: ‘We are talking about one squirrel here. The vet says the squirrel was “alive but not responsive”. That’s how I saw it. I tried my best to have away with it but I had other things to do.’

Magistrates granted Worthington unconditional bail. He will be sentenced next month.
