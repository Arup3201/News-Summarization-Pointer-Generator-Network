Former basketball star Dennis Rodman has appealed to fellow veterans to play a match in North Korea for dictator Kim Jong Un saying: 'Don’t be afraid, it’s all love here.'

The flamboyant Rodman has admitted struggling to convince former NBA players to travel to Pyongyang to take part in the exhibition match to celebrate Kim’s birthday next month.

It comes after the unpredictable dictator executed his once powerful uncle this month.

At trials for North Korean players yesterday at the Pyongyang Indoor Gymnasium Rodman said: 'You know, they’re still afraid to come here, but I’m just telling them, you know, don’t be afraid man, it’s all love, it’s all love here.'

'I understand what’s going on with the political stuff, and I say, I don’t go into that venture, I’m just doing one thing for these kids here, and for this country, and for my country, and for the world pretty much.'

Rodman, who returned from the four-day trip on Monday, said he expects to announce the roster soon. He also said he is planning another game in June.

Wearing a pink button-down shirt and puffing on a cigar he watched as a couple dozen local players took to the basketball court for the tryouts.

After the session, he told the players that each of the 12 he chooses will get two new pairs of tennis shoes.

When asked why he liked basketball, North Korean player Kim Un Chol told Rodman he started playing the game because he was impressed by it on TV, and said he also wants to be good at the sport because it is a favourite of leader Kim and his late father, Kim Jong Il.

Pressure: Rodman has been told he should ask Kim Jong Un about human rights abuses in North Korea

Rodman asked all the players if they felt the same way. They nodded in unison.

'I want you guys to do one thing for your leader,' Rodman then told them. 'It’s his birthday. It’s a very special, special day for the country.'

Rodman and Kim have struck up an unlikely friendship since he travelled to the secretive state for the first time in February with the Harlem Globetrotters for an American television show.

He remains the highest-profile American to meet Kim since the leader inherited power from his father in 2011.

Known as much for his piercings, tattoos and bad behavior as he was for basketball, Rodman has mostly avoided politics in his dealings with the North and has avoided commenting on the North’s human rights record or its continued detainment of American Kenneth Bae for allegedly committing anti-state crimes.

Rodman stressed that he hopes the game will be friendly, without political or nationalistic overtones.

He said the former NBA players will take on the North Koreans in the first half, but the teams will be mixed for the second half.

'It’s not about win or loss. It’s about one thing - unite two countries,' Rodman said.

This was Rodman's third trip to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. Previously, he spent time dining as a guest of Kim, with whom he says he has a genuine friendship.

An entourage of burly men pushed their way through a scrum of journalists waiting for Rodman at Beijing airport today. Rodman answered only a few of the questions thrown at him on the run.

Asked whether he was disappointed not to see Kim this time around, Rodman said: 'Nope, I don't worry about it, I will see him again.'

Rodman said before leaving he was going to provide North Korea's national basketball team with four days of training during the trip.

'It was awesome, man,' he said of the training he conducted.

Rodman's latest visit follows the rare public purge of Kim's powerful uncle Jang Song Thaek, who was executed this month.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye has described recent events as a 'reign of terror'. The purging of Jang, considered the second most powerful man in the North, indicated factionalism within the secretive government.

Ahead of the trip, Seoul-based North Korean human rights activist Shin Dong-hyuk said in an open letter in the Washington Post that Rodman should talk to Kim about human rights abuses in North Korea.

Rodman told Reuters last week it was not his place to talk about such issues.

Rodman's first visit in February came shortly after North Korea conducted its third nuclear test in defiance of U.N. resolutions. Rodman said upon his return from that trip that Kim wanted to receive a call from President Barack Obama, an avid basketball fan.

The White House has said the United States has direct channels of communication with North Korea and declined to directly respond to Rodman's message that Kim hoped to hear from Obama after his previous visit.
