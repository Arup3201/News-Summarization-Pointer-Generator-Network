A local newspaper was forced to issue a grovelling apology after an advert for a car hire company was altered to say that they offered oral sex to customers.

The Pembrokeshire Herald said it is calling in the police after they inadvertently printed the obscenity.

The Enterprise Rent-a-Car advert read: 'Free pick-up from your home, office or repair shop, and c*** s******'.

Other adverts in the South Wales newspaper were also sabotaged just before it went to print.

The pages were altered after they were formally signed off by the editorial team ahead of publication.

By the time the blunder had been spotted, 20,000 copies of the paper had already been distributed to newsagents and supermarkets.

The advert appeared in the July 19 edition of the newspaper which is published by MegaGroup Pembrokeshire. The local newspaper was only launched on July 5.

Publisher Tom Sinclair said the paper sold in record numbers as people desperately tried to get hold of a copy.

'I was phoned up by Tesco and told they had run out of copies of the paper and they get 600,' he said.

'I don't have the final sale figures yet, but people were saying they were finding it hard to get a copy. I think people wanted to see for themselves what had happened.

'The effect has been quite the opposite of what the saboteurs must have intended.'

In a note to readers, Mr Sinclair apologised for the mistake.

'A number of adverts in last Fridayâ€™s newspaper had additional copy inserted into them after they had been proofed and signed off,' he said.

'The extra copy contained language that was inappropriate for a family newspaper like ours.

'I would like to make it absolutely clear that the adverts were altered without the knowledge of our advertisers or this newspaper.

'The pages had been signed off and were ready to go to print. I would like to apologise to our readers and advertisers for any distress caused.'

A spokesman for Dyfed Powys Police said they were aware of the incident but were waiting to receive a letter from the newspaper's publishers before deciding whether to investigate.

A spokesman for Enterprise Rent-a-Car could not be reached for comment.
