Jason Kenny could not clinch England's second gold medal in an hour at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome and had to settle for silver in the men's sprint behind New Zealand's Sam Webster.

Kenny, a three-time Olympic champion, came from behind to beat Australia's Peter Lewis in the semi, but struggled with cramp during the final and was sick afterwards.

'I'm shattered,' Kenny said, whose medal ceremony was delayed because the Englishman was so ill. 'I got a funny feeling, got a bit of cramp or something. I was throwing up a minute ago. I feel terrible.'

Kenny, who could only manage fifth at the World Championships earlier this year, struggled in qualifying on Thursday, only going through in 11th place of 12 riders.

He upped his game on Friday, though, to sail through the quarter and semi final.

Kenny lost the opening race of the final before winning the second by less than the width of his wheel.

But Kenny didn't have the legs to cut Webster's lead in the third and subsequently had to accept silver.
