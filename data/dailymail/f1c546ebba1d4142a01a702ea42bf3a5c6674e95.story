Walking the catwalk in high heels can be tricky, even for the industry's most seasoned models.

And on today's This Morning show, one producer who had to fill in for a model almost hurt her baby as well as her pride as she toppled off the set holding her young daughter.

Model Ellie, who is also the show's producer, was carrying her daughter Poppy when she walked straight off the side of the catwalk in a Mrs Santa costume, leaving little Poppy in tears.

Taking a tumble: Ellie, the show's producer who was modelling a Christmas outfit with daughter Poppy, tripped from the runway

The show had opened with adorable young Poppy scratching her head and looking sleepy in a cute and cosy Christmas one piece as presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield cooed over her.

'Are you sleepy?' they asked as Holly became quite taken by the small child.

But things took a turn for the worse as Ellie set off down the catwalk to model her Mrs Santa outfit.

It started well: ...but as she strutted down the catwalk and approached the end she took a tumble

As she modelled a Santa outfit, she walked off the side and stumbled off the catwalk.

Petite Ellie managed to cling onto her baby as Phillip asked: 'Oh Ellie, are you OK?'

Faye Sawyer, This Morning's fashion 
expert, was seen trying not to laugh while Phillip pointed out she was wearing very high heels, before joking 'she's been 
on the gin as well'.

They're ok! The mother and daughter were ok but baby Poppy can be heard crying in the background

Both Poppy and Ellie appeared to be fine, but Poppy could be heard crying in the background as the cameras on the live show kept rolling.

Viewers took to Twitter to discuss the incident.

One said: 'Watching that woman fall down the step and nearly drop the baby on this morning with @rea_gyselynck has made my day! #whoopsydaisy'.
