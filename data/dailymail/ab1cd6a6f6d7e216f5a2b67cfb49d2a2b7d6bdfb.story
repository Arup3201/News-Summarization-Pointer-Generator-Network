The girlfriend of an off-duty police officer has been charged with shooting him to death inside his home after she originally contended it happened accidentally when she removed a gun from their dog's mouth, authorities said.

Tyaina Finch was charged with murder, aggravated assault and possessing instruments of crime in the death of Mark Hudson in Darby Township, near Philadelphia, on Saturday. 

Hudson had worked part-time for the Darby Borough Police Department for four years.

The dog did it: Slain Darby Borough Patrolman Mark Hudson’s girlfriend, Tyaina Finch, initially told investigators he was mortally wounded as she tried to retrieve his duty weapon from their yellow Labrador retriever’s mouth

Tribute: Funeral arrangements are set and a vigil was also held Wednesday night for the Darby Borough police officer who was killed allegedly at the hands of his girlfriend

District Attorney Jack Whelan said Finch's statements to police had been 'inconsistent.' 

He described the couple's relationship as 'tumultuous' and said officers had been called to the home before for domestic disturbances.

'We believe she acted on this particular day with specific intent to kill (Hudson),' he said.

Finch, who was held without bail, couldn't be reached for comment by telephone on Tuesday. 

The county public defender's office couldn't be reached for comment on her behalf.

The story: While Finch told investigators she does not recall pulling the trigger in their Darby Township row home, the affidavit of probable cause indicates she remembers dropping the firearm after Hudson’s body jerked back and his shoulders hit the wall in a bedroom, where he was found lying in a corner, unresponsive

Authorities allege in a criminal complaint that Finch, who's from Glenolden, at first said the shooting occurred accidentally: She saw their dog with a gun on the floor and took the gun from the dog's mouth, and as she turned toward Hudson the gun went off.

The following day, police allege, she told officers she fired the gun in self-defense after Hudson attacked her.

Authorities said a caller identifying herself as Finch on the day of the shooting told an ambulance dispatcher 'we were playing and I didn't know that his gun was right there and it went off.' 

Finch told a police officer arriving at the scene 'it was an accident,' the criminal complaint says.

Finch was arrested Monday on threat and assault charges stemming from a dispute last summer during which authorities allege she threatened Hudson with a knife.

History of arguments: Last summer, the two were in the middle of a break-up and Hudson had told her to leave his home. During the argument, Finch allegedly grabbed an 8-inch kitchen knife while screaming at him. Hudson hid in an upstairs bedroom, locked the door and called police, investigators said
