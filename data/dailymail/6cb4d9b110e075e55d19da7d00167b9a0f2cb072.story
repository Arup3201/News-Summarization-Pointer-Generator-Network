We've all experienced the humiliation of struggling to manoeuvre a car in a tight space in front of a crowd.

But for this woman, the price was higher than mere embarrassment.

Her mistake was to try to do a three-point turn outside the home of new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.

The Foreign Secretary's minders apparently decided to take action after the woman veered towards their BMW

One minder, who had been waiting outside Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's house, decided to take action after watching the woman's three-point turn deteriorate into a seven-point turn in the middle of the road

The minders called in armed officers after becoming concerned and the woman's keys were confiscated and her Toyota Yaris searched (pictured). It was then decided the car would be towed away from the scene

And as her disastrous attempt soon became a seven-point turn, plain-clothes protection officers became suspicious.

When her Toyota then veered sharply towards their black BMW, the policemen swooped.

After questioning her and searching her vehicle, they discovered she was driving without a licence and called in back-up to the narrow street in Belgravia, one of London’s wealthiest areas.

Armed police officers arrived on motorbikes moments later to issue the hapless driver with a ticket. She then watched as her black car was towed away. 

 A witness said: ‘The officers were outside Mr Hammond’s house waiting for him to come out. She [the motorist] was trying to make a three-point turn and looked as though she was about to crash into them.

‘One of the officers sounded the horn to stop her and then they got out and questioned her before calling uniformed officers in. The woman looked really fed up and had to get the bus home.’

The incident occurred at 8.30am on July 19, just four days after David Cameron’s reshuffle, in which it was announced that Mr Hammond, 58, would be replacing William Hague as Foreign Secretary.

The woman appeared frustrated as she was questioned by police officers following the unfortunate incident

Seemingly oblivious to what had unfolded outside his home, Mr Hammond left the house later that morning to be escorted to Westminster by the minders.

The average price of a terrace house on the exclusive street is £3.6million, and the surrounding area has been home to Margaret Thatcher and James Bond actor Sir Roger Moore. Oxford-educated Mr Hammond, who is thought to be worth £9million, also has a nine-bedroom house in Woking, Surrey.

As Foreign Secretary he can use two grace and favour homes – £20million Carlton Gardens, near Buckingham Palace, and Chevening House, a 115-room mansion in Kent.

The Foreign Office declined to comment on the incident. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the woman’s car was towed because she was driving without a licence.
