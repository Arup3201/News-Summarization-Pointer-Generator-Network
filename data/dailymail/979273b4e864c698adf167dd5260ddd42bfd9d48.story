The FA plan to attract sponsorship rights for their flagship Cup competition from around the world in the style of Manchester United’s successful global commercial operation.

Wembley are remarkably confident they can find a £9million lead partner for the FA Cup to replace Budweiser, as well as five separate sponsorships of the tournament split between overseas territories.

This version of Old Trafford’s scalpel approach to sponsorship coincides with Phil Barker, former global sales manager at United, having joined the FA commercial department to spearhead the new approach. The FA are working on 20 live leads from companies.

New deal: The FA is looking for a £9m sponsorship to replace Budweiser and separate deals in other markets

Research done following Arsenal’s victory against Hull City shows the Cup is still a big enough worldwide attraction for the FA’s initiative to work despite the competition losing some of its glamour in comparison with the  Premier League.

The FA’s Inclusion Board, who were so vocal over the Richard Scudamore sexist email saga, should focus their attention on a row in the Combined Counties League.

Three administrators have resigned over the FA’s failure to act following complaints about Iranian referee John Nazari, who in turn claims to have been the victim of discrimination over performance assessments .

Sykes, best known for her Boddingtons adverts, proved to be the most wooden of sports presenters.

BT believed she would have improved over time - she couldn’t have got worse - and say it was her decision to leave as she couldn’t devote enough time to the role.

While Andrew Flintoff warms up for his T20 comeback for Lancashire by playing for St Annes against Penrith in the Northern League, his fellow 2005 Ashes hero Ashley Giles will make his debut for Nuneaton away to Kenilworth in the Warwickshire League.

Meanwhile, Yorkshire have asked Lord’s museum to lend them five cricket balls used by Hedley Verity, including the one with which he took a world record 10 for 10 against Notts in 1932, to help promote a new book.

The MCC want guarantees over display conditions, including security, heating and lighting before they will release the artefacts.

Support: Former FA compliance chief Graham Bean, now with his own business, is helping new Leeds owner Massimo Cellino as a consultant

Graham Bean, the former FA compliance chief who now runs his own business helping clubs, has moved into Elland Road in a consultancy role for new owner Massimo Cellino.

Bean is helping to keep the troubled organisation afloat, with club secretary Alison Royston, suspended for no apparent reason, among the many Cellino staff casualties.

Leeds players did not receive their monthly pay yesterday because the bank has frozen the club’s account following a £1m winding-up order connected with the money allegedly owed to former chief executive David Haigh.

Meanwhile, Haigh is facing a third week in  custody in Dubai, where he is being questioned over alleged fraud while working for Dubai-based investment bank GFH Capital.

The return to Brazil of the country’s disgraced former football chief Ricardo Teixeira following a spell in Miami will increase scrutiny of the incendiary comments of his ex-wife Joana, who sits on the World Cup organising committee.

Joana, the daughter of former FIFA president Joao Havelange, said about the widespread protests in Brazil over misuse of public funds for the World Cup: ‘I’m not going to fight against it. What has had to be spent has been spent and what has to be robbed has been robbed.’
