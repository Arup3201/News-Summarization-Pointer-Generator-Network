Designer Rachel Roy is jetting to Paris to attend Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's wedding alongside rumoured A list guests Beyoncé and Jay Z -  days after it was reported she clashed with Solange Knowles at the Met Ball.

Rachel, 43, was rumoured to have had a blow-up with Solange just hours before Beyoncé's younger sister lashed out at her brother-in-law Jay Z in an explosive elevator altercation at a Met Ball after party.

Rumours were rife that Solange had flown into a rage after the rapper grew 'too close' to Rachel, the ex-wife of his former business partner Damon Dash, with whom he had an ugly falling out.

Fancy: Rachel Roy attended Kim Kardashian's wedding shower at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills on May 10

Rachel is close friends with Kim and earlier this month attended her Parisian themed wedding shower at the swanky Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills.

She posted pictures of chocolate favors made in the shape of the Eiffel Tour made by Californian bakery Cinderella Cakes, as well as macaroons by Parisian bakery Laduree.

The mother-of-two posed for pictures in a photo booth at the event, alongside Kim and her best friend Brittny Gastineau.

After video footage emerged of Solange Knowles hitting out at multi-millionaire rapper Jay Z in the elevator leaving the Boom Boom room at the Standard hotel in New York, US Weekly reported that Solange had yelled at Rachel earlier at the after-party.

The source added that, during the disagreement, Beyoncé 'got in the middle of it, although it remains unclear what it was about.

The 27-year-old apparently told the designer 'anyone who gets close to Jay has to be warned and deal with her as a sister,' according to US Weekly, while the Daily News also reported that both Solange and Beyoncé were unhappy that Rachel was too close to Jay Z.

Despite this, Rachel remains insistent 
that Solange was fighting with someone else standing close by her and is said to be unhappy at
 being drawn into the incident, MailOnline understands. Indeed, she did not even see Beyoncé or Jay Z that evening.

Interestingly, just two years ago, Solange accompanied Roy to the 2012 Met Gala.

Things then came to a dramatic end in the
 lift, when Solange flew into a rage when he said he wanted to continue 
partying alone at Rihanna's after party, where she believed Roy would 
also be in attendance.

Roy has a long association with Jay, Beyonce and their family. She was previously married to the rapper's former manager and business partner Damon Dash before divorcing in 2008.

Jay and Damon famously fell out after the hip-hop star became the president of Def Jam Recordings, soon after the music giant bought their Roc-A-Fella Records.

In 2005, their friendship was further soured when Jay bought Damon out of his stake in their Rocawear clothing label.

Damon
 appeared to comment on the furore over the video of Solange hitting Jay
 in the elevator as he posted an old photo of his teenage daughter Ava 
with Solange on his Instagram.

He
 wrote: 'Forgot about this one @ava_dash @atrak and solange ...I am 
actually impressed with her independent spirit... She seems like a 
fighter #festivallife.'

Rachel also seemed to allude to the furore as she referenced a Jay Z song on Twitter on Wednesday.

Promoting her clothing line, she tweeted a link to her new summer line, with the words: 'The Beach is better!'

This was taken to be a clear reference to 2007 Jay Z track Beach is Better.

But after being criticised for her tweet, Rachel added: 'Tweeties this is silly,the beach IS better in summer or anytime in my book,no idea that was the name of a song, #welovethesea #alllove xxRR'

After the elevator attack, Beyoncé and Jay Z released a statement saying it was a family issue between Jay Z and Solange, saying: 'As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it.

'Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred," the statement continued. "They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family.'

Since then, the trio has been all smiles, with Beyoncé and Jay Z hanging out at a Brooklyn Nets game last week and Beyoncé posting a shot of herself on Instagram posing with her little sister in New Orleans on Saturday.

Beyoncé and Jay Z are thought to be attending Kim and Kanye's wedding after being told cameras for the Kardashians E! reality show will not be covering the ceremony and reception.

The couple have invited guests to join them in Paris for a pre-wedding dinner on Friday night, which is thought to include a guided tour of the Palace of Versailles outside the city.

It is thought the pair will wed in France before taking their guests to Forte Belvedere, a 16th-century fortress in Florence, Italy, for the wedding party.

According to a spokeswoman at the mayor’s office, the couple have rented the Italian venue for the wedding party for $400,000 (300,000 euros).

Timing: On Monday, Jay's ex business partner Damon Dash posted a photo of Solange with his and Rachel's daughter Ava at the Coachella Festival last month, praising the singer as a 'fighter'

Close ties: Rachel, pictured in 2006, was previously married to entrepreneur Damon Dash - who was the manager and business partner of Jay Z until the mid 2000s - and the couple have two daughters
