The Queensland nurse at the centre of last week's Ebola scare has warned the world must do 'so much more' to stop the deadly virus before it gets out of control. 

Sue Ellen Kovack, 57, said it was a 'huge relief' to be released from Cairns Hospital early on Monday morning, after she tested negative for the illness for a second time.  

Ms Kovack had recently returned from working as a volunteer nurse in Sierra Leone when she came down with a fever last week.

There are an estimated 7,200 Ebola cases in West Africa, according to the latest figures from the World Health organisation

Despite criticism from Federal MP Bob Katter last week that Australian aid workers were putting the nation at risk, Ms Kovack said medical professionals should head overseas to fight the illness.  

In a statement, Ms Kovack said she would like to 'bring the focus back' to the tens of thousands of people affected by Ebola in West Africa.

'The international community needs to do so much more right now to stop Ebola in its tracks, before it really gets right out of control,' she said. 

'It has been so inspiring and it has really kept me going in the past few days to know there’s growing public support for action to help people affected by Ebola in West Africa.'

'Most importantly to me, I’m sending a message to my fellow medical professionals who are thinking about heading over to treat the sick and work at bringing Ebola under control: Please, please do it'.

Ms Kovack said she had been moved by the outpouring of support for her.

While Ms Kovack was in hospital her friend Jennifer King told ABC's Lateline program the volunteer nurse was 'popular' and 'well-known' in the Cairns medical community. 

'She wants to help people, she's incredibly compassionate and she's selfless like not many people on earth,' Ms King said.

'A bunch of the nurses [at Cairns Hospital] have gone down to Accident and Emergency [department] to offer to nurse Sue Ellen, which is really brave. 

'They're upset and they want to help.' 

Ms Kovack's humanitarian efforts were slammed by outspoken Federal MP Bob Katter.

The member for Kennedy - whose electorate takes in the southern area of Cairns and the town's airport - said her volunteering pursuits had put the nation at risk. 

Mr Katter said it was 'unbelievable and incomprehensive' how a person could get into Australia from an Ebola-infected country.

'There cannot be any compromise with this,' Mr Katter said.

'If you want to go to one of these countries, however laudable your motivation, I am sorry but when you return to Australia, you must be quarantined for three weeks - not home quarantined.' 

Mr Katter said Australian aid workers travelling to west Africa, including Ms Kovack, were putting Australia at risk.

'We love these people, and we honour these Australians for being self-sacrificing, but compared to the risk they create for our country, it is not remotely comparable.

'One person's moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to Australia,' he said.

But Queensland's chief medical officer Dr Jeannette Young last week praised Ms Kovack's efforts and said she had acted appropriately when raising the alarm to health authorities.

'I think she's an amazing lady to go to Africa and provide that service,' Dr Young said. 'She has done everything appropriately.'

Ms Kovack remained in isolation after she returned home, as is the protocol for medical workers who have treated Ebola patients overseas.

Dr Young said Ms Kovack had been testing herself in the 'isolation' of her own home and had not been into the Cairns community since she returned home last week.

'(On Thursday) morning she rang up as part of [national health] protocol because she developed a low-grade fever of 37.6 degrees Celsius.

'But we felt it important that she come into Cairns Hospital for Ebola virus disease.' 

Ms Kovack is originally from Toronto, Canada but is living in Cairns, Queensland

A Federal Department of Health spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia any health care worker who comes back from an affected country needs to monitor their health - including taking their temperature twice a day - and cannot return to work for 21 days. 

Health Minister Peter Dutton moved to reassure the public that talking to people arriving from Ebola-hit countries is still the best method of screening for the deadly disease.

He said doctors still backed the process to identify and contact people arriving into the country who may have been exposed to the disease.

'I think that's the more effective screening process at the moment, but these things evolve,' he told the ABC.

Mr Dutton said introducing a screening in arrivals halls could be problematic.

'It provides a sort of air of complacency if you like,' he told the ABC.

'So people come through, they feel unwell a couple of days later and they think "No, no, I've just been through that screening process and I wasn't picked up, I'm ok".'

Mr Dutton reiterated the World Health Organisation had not asked Australia for on-the-ground health workers in the stricken African countries.

But he said that advice may change over time. Australia will send help if a case presents in the region, for example in PNG, the minister said.

'We would be expected within our region to rapidly respond, and we have the capacity to do that with a team out of Darwin ... and resources within Canberra,' Mr Dutton said. 

Before she left for Sierra Leone, Ms Kovack spoke to media about her journey, and was actively keeping her friends and family up to date on Facebook.

'I'm a little bit nervous, a little bit anxious but healthily anxious I think,' she told local newspaper The Cairns Post. 

In an interview with the ABC last month, she said it was her responsibility to help those in need.

'I care about humanity and if I have what people need, I would like to use these skills.

'Why me? Well, if not me then who?' Ms Kovack said. 

Ms Kovack recently shared happy snaps of her in Sierra Leone, dressed in quarantine uniforms and being sprayed by decontamination hoses. 

Ms Kovack is expected to find out on Friday morning whether or not she has the deadly virus

On September 23, she wrote: 'Big day... Have taken our first bloods from our first ebola survivor at the (International Federation of the Red Cross) treatment centre. 

It was not the first time Ms Kovack had travelled overseas to help those in need.

She had previously worked with the Red Cross in war-torn South Sudan and had volunteered in Sierra Leone in 2002.

The Ebola virus has infected an estimated 7,200 people, according to the World Health Organisation. More than 3300 have died. 

There have been no recorded cases in Australia. 

Last month, a Gold Coast man was placed in isolation after he was feared to be suffering the deadly illness. 

He was quickly cleared of the condition.
