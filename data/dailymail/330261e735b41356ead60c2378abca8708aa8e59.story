'Cruel': Teacher Lavonne Alioth (above) has been accused of abusing her special-needs pupils during class

A special-needs teacher has been charged with child cruelty after allegedly forcing her pupils into a series of degrading punishments.

Lavonne Alioth made one student stand in a corner for eight hours and deprived him of adequate food, according to an arrest warrant.

She told another to adopt yoga positions throughout the day and covered the head of a wheelchair-bound girl with a sheet because she was loud, it was claimed.

She is also said to have played them rap music with offensive language that included the N-word.

Alioth, who works at Camp Creek Middle School in Fulton County, Georgia, has been indicted on three counts of child cruelty, according to Fulton jail records.

Investigations began after the school system received complaints about students being late for lunch.

Alioth was arrested on March 1 after turning herself in and has been released on a $24,000 bond.

Parents at the school expressed their outrage yesterday.

'As far as standing in the corner and not being able to eat, that's just crazy,' Joey Green told wsbtv.com.

Gerren
Taylor added: 'I'm in shock. I don't believe this. We have never heard 
of anything like this happening at the school before.'

Alioth
could not be reached by phone yesterday and Camp Creek principal 
DeMarcos Holland declined to comment, according to Atlanta News.
