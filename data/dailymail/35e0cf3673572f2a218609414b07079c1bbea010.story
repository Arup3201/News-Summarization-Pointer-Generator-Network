The number 10 has always inferred something mystical, implying an almost divine talent to elevate the sport into the heavens and produce the game’s defining moments. 

From Diego Maradona and Michel Platini, to Ronaldinho and Zinedine Zidane, these are the ‘game-changers’, the graceful technicians who glide effortlessly like ice-skaters and instinctively seek out space and angles among the gangs of opponents. They are the headline-makers, the ones who speak a language unintelligible to us mortals.

This World Cup has been no different, the star performances produced by those whose jerseys are adorned by that famous number: Neymar for Brazil, Lionel Messi for Argentina, James Rodriguez for Colombia.

Change: Traditional centre forwards have struggled in Brazil and number 10s like Neymar have flourished

Class: The World Cup has always featured great number 10s like France's Zinedine Zidane

Memorable: Argentina's Diego Maradona was also a number 10 and a legend of the game

Samba: Brazil's Ronaldinho is another great World Cup number 10

Skilful: France's Michel Platini was a brilliant number 10 in the 1980s

Poor: Traditional centre forwards like Belgium's Romelu Lukaku have struggled at the World Cup

Others special showings have come from those players awarded the freedom to flit between the lines and commit opponents, such as Arjen Robben for Holland and Thomas Muller for Germany.

These five players, without question the most influential in Brazil, have twenty goals between them and make up five of the top six scorers in the competition.

There is nothing new in the phenomenon of the magical number 10, yet their overbearing influence on this World Cup, assuming all the striking responsibility, presents the question as to where the conventional forward has disappeared. The central striker have fallen into a black hole, the number 10’s deprived of a lethal partner, increasingly tasked as the solo artists that must bring the rest of the band to life.

So what of the number 9, is he now consigned to the role of foil, offering merely perspiration to facilitate the inspiration of Mr 10?

The evidence of this World Cup would presume so.

Star: Argentina's Lionel Messi has lit up the World Cup in Brazil with four goals in four games

Clinical: James Rodriguez has netted five goals and number 10s make up five of the top six scorers

For Brazil, Fred has barely registered, a lamentable apology for the host nation’s whose heights have been scaled by Ronaldo and Romario in recent years. He has touched the ball just ninety times in four games, compared to the 264 times that Neymar’s golden boots have caressed the Brazuca.

Others have fallen beneath their usual level, Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain the shade to Messi’s light for Argentina. Napoli forward Higuain has played four matches, failing to score or complete a dribble and offering just one assist as a contribution. 

This World Cup has exposed the traditional centre forward role as a dying art, deemed as a luxury as tactics evolve. Theories abound over the need to contribute to every phase of play, to take part in the defensive effort rather than merely apply the finishing flourish.

Would a Gary Lineker or Gerd Muller be indulged by an international coach in this era? Possibly not. Goals are no longer the currency by which strikers are judged.

Awful: Brazil centre forward Fred has struggled to show any sort of form during the World Cup

Unusual: Holland's Robin van Persie has bucked the trend of centre forwards and scored three goals

Romelu Lukaku toiled with little success for Belgium before being dropped. Germany have not started with a conventional centre-forward in any game, only hailing for the poacher Miroslav Klose when behind against Ghana. Javier Hernandez, the Manchester United forward with a better international striking ratio than Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, did not start a match in Brazil for Mexico. 

There have been some impressive showings, with Robin van Persie outstanding for Holland in his first two games, before rather tailing off in the knockout round against Mexico. Karim Benzema has scored three for France, netting two against Honduras and one against Switzerland, but must now produce in the knock-out rounds. Students of modern coaching, however, would argue that Van Persie and Benzema are ‘nine-and-a-halves’, to borrow a phrase from Brendan Rodgers. 

Speaking with Sportsmail this time last year, Robbie Fowler diagnosed the ‘number 9’ malaise as an issue for English football.

‘Everyone wants to play a 4-2-3-1 formation, with just the one striker,’ Fowler explained, ‘We had so many talented English strikers in the Nineties, with Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Andy Cole, Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright and Michael Owen but they were mostly playing in partnerships, too.

Changing of the guard? Traditional centre forwards like Alan Shearer are disappearing from the game

Rarity: Out and out scorers like Michael Owen are becoming less common as time goes by

‘Now, there is the No 9 and the No 10. The 10 plays behind the nine so they are never really playing as a genuine partnership. That might have hindered the number of forwards coming through. You can only play the one so youngsters may be thinking of playing somewhere else because there is just the one striking position up for grabs. That may have something to do with it. I have played in the lone striker role and my game was not really suited to that. If I were playing now, I would try to play in the No 10 position.’

In October, Arsene Wenger then went one step further, arguing that this is a continental-wide epidemic in Europe. 

The Arsenal manager, explaining why his pursuit of attacking reinforcements had proved so troublesome, said: ‘Europe still produces fantastic football players but if you look closely, we do not produce top strikers anymore. Very few. All the big strikers now come from South America. During the summer, Falcao went to Monaco, Cavani went to PSG, everybody wanted to sign Luis Suarez and Gonzalo Higuain went to Napoli for big money.

Scarce: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes there are a dearth of centre forwards in Europe

‘That’s an area where in Europe it is difficult to find great strikers. Even in Germany, where I can remember so many great strikers from years gone by, they are producing many exceptional players but not young strikers. Is that a consequence of the way we coach? Of modern life? I do not know.’

The feeling from this World Cup in Brazil suggests that Wenger was well-reasoned but perhaps he underestimated the debate, for this is an issue that will engulf youth coaches worldwide in the years to come.
