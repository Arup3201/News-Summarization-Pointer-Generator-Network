Gerry Adams has been named by an influential American magazine as a former IRA commander who personally passed ‘death sentences’ on its enemies.

Adams, 64, has long denied belonging to the terror group.

But the New Yorker magazine has published a damning 15,000-word assessment of allegations against him.

New Yorker magazine has accused Gerry Adams, pictured, of being a former IRA commander 

It claims that Adams himself issued the order to ‘disappear’ mother-of-ten Jean McConville who was dragged screaming from her Belfast home by a masked gang in 1972 after she was suspected of being a British Army informer.

Last year Adams was arrested by police investigating Mrs McConville’s murder. He has always denied any involvement and was released without charge.

The article names Adams as having been a senior member of the IRA and the military commander responsible for the Belfast Brigade.

None of the claims is new but their collation by the magazine – in a devastating essay entitled ‘Where the bodies are buried’ with another headline saying Adams ‘authorised murder’ – is seen as a sign that the Sinn Fein president can no longer regard himself as the ‘acceptable face’ of Irish Republicanism in America.

The magazine claimed that Gerry Adams, pictured, joined the IRA in the 1960s and passed 'death sentences' 

Patrick Radden Keefe, the author of the New Yorker essay, wrote: ‘It is believed that Adams joined [the IRA] as a teenager, in the mid-Sixties. Several former IRA volunteers confirmed to me that Adams was a member of the group.’

He said Adams had presided over a meeting of IRA bombers in Belfast to plot the 1973 bombing campaign in London.

The article also said Adams dispatched an IRA member to New York to procure Armalite assault rifles for use against the British Army, having them smuggled back aboard the QEII ocean liner.
