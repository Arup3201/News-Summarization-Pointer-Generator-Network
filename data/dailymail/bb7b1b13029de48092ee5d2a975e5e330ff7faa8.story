The director of a new film has been forced into a grovelling apology after he sent out a promotional pack including a balaclava, nails and a roll of duct tape.

The film, A Belfast Story, is about paramilitaries in Northern Ireland and is set in a post-Troubles Belfast which is still marred by violence.

Starring Irish actor Colm Meaney the film is meant to the reality of modern Belfast.

But film writers were horrified when they received the press pack full of unsavoury accessories leading Northern Irish writer Chris Hewitt, of Empire magazine, to brand it 'the most distasteful freebie ever.'

A Belfast Story: The film is set in modern day Belfast which is shows as still marred by violence, pictured an attack by Nationalist groups in the Ardoyne area of Belfast in 2009

In evident dismay Hewitt tweeted that he had received 'a box containing a bag of nails (for a nail bomb) and a balaclava, for A Belfast Story. Not quite sure what point whoever sent it is trying to make. But I'm pretty sure it's a moronic one.'

The promotional boxes, which also feature fake newspaper clippings and surveillance photos, were sent to media outlets including Belfast’s UTV.

The plot of the film, follows Meaney playing a weary detective tasked with investigating the murders of former paramilitaries.

It was written and directed by Nathan Todd, a former engineering student at Queen's University, Belfast.

Todd told the BBC that the purpose of the packs was not to frighten or offend people.

In a conversation with the BBC Good Morning Ulster programme he said: 'The idea was to interest people in a movie we were making which is essentially the story of the two choices which face Belfast, do we engage retribution or reconciliation.

'Obviously, the intention is not to offend anyone. We apologise if we did.

'The intention is to raise awareness for something that we did, that delves into some legitimate questions and tells some interesting stories about the city and the country.'

Split psyche Northern Ireland: The producers of the film say the pack was meant to represent the realist of modern Belfast

But whatever the justification for the stunt was many like Mr Hewitt no seem inclined to give the film exploring 'a life after terrorism' a miss.

Mr Hewitt remains unimpressed by the apology and told the Independent: 'I’d like to sit down with whoever came up with that little brainwave and explain to them what growing up during The Troubles was like.

'I’m now not going to see it. There is such a thing as bad publicity.'

Teri Kelly, a publicist for the movie, which opens next month, said the press kit had been sent out by the producers to represent the divisions that remain in Northern Ireland’s psyche.

He said: 'It was sent out to show the two sides of the film, reconciliation and retribution.

'There are two sides to the box and one side represents retribution and violence and one side represents turning away from violence. It tries to show the dichotomy within Northern Ireland.'

The press kit appears to be the most ludicrous promotional movie stunt since a Missouri cinema hired a gunman in full tactical gear to storm an Iron Man 3 screening in May.

Terrified audience members called police, fearing they had stumbled into a repeat of the Colorado cinema shooting which left 12 dead during a premiere screening of The Dark Knight Rises last year.
