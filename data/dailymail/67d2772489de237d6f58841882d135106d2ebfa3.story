Lost? This coyote was caught in Manhattan earlier this month. A second one (not pictured) was found in Stuyvesant Town this weekend and taken to the Bronx 

Officers from New York's Park's Department captured a coyote in a Manhattan apartment complex.

Tranquilizer darts were used to sedate the coyote which was found in Stuyvesant Town on Sunday.  

Parks officials say the coyote was delivered to Animal Care and Control where she was examined and fed by veterinary staff and released in an 'appropriate wilderness area in the Bronx' Sunday night.

Park rangers began efforts to track the coyote after numerous sightings of the critter were made by the public.

It is unclear where the Eastern Coyote was from or how it got to one of the densest neighborhoods in the city. 

Another coyote was caught and released in the Bronx two weeks ago after being found in a Manhattan park.

Most coyotes pose no danger to people but the Parks Department advises New Yorkers to never feed or approach one, especially if it shows signs of aggression.

 'Although it's often called the concrete jungle, New York City has over 5,000 acres of forest land and is home to an abundance of wildlife,' said city Parks Commissioner Mitchell Silver.
