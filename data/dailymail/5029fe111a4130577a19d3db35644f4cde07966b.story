The Kremlin today denied reports from an American newspaper that Vladimir Putin maybe suffering from pancreatic cancer.

The Russian president's spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by RIA Novosti news agency saying: 'Dream on - and curse their tongues. Everything is normal.'

Peskov had been asked to comment on the reports from The New York Post last week, which spread to other media.

The New York Post reported ‘Putin’s Health Woes’ and claimed there were rumours in Poland and Belarus that the 62 year old strongman had 'cancer of the spinal cord'

The US paper's report headlined 'Putin's Health Woes' claimed there were rumours in Poland and Belarus that the 62 year old strongman had 'cancer of the spinal cord'.

But the Post's Richard Johnson wrote: 'My sources say it's pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal forms of the disease.'

The report went on: 'Putin was allegedly being treated by a doctor from the old East Germany.

The way that President Vladimir Putin wants the world to see him - a rough tough action man

'The doc had been trying various treatments, including steroid shots, which would explain Putin's puffy appearance.

'But I'm told the physician quit recently, confiding that he was mistreated by Putin's security detail.'

Putin recently took a Siberian break on his birthday - for the first time since he came to power more than 14 years ago.

However, he has recently kept up a busy itinerary and last week made a keynote speech in Sochi blasting American foreign policy.
