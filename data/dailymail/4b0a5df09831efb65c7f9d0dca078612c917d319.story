On a frozen windswept hill on the outskirts of Kabul, half a dozen Pashtun men broke the icy ground with pick axes.

Nearby, the body of eighteen-month-old Saiyma Gadazai lay wrapped in a plain blanket, her pale face glowing in the gold winter sun.

All morning her mother and aunts had washed her remains and prayed over her, in keeping with Muslim tradition. Now the men and boys took responsibility for her final journey.

Heartbreaking: The tiny body of eighteen-month-old Saiyma Gadazai is carried to her final resting place after she froze to death in a refugee camp in Kabul

Killed by the cold floor: Saiyma's father, Safarali, tried to wake his daughter, but she was not breathing. He said he was not able to afford a decent stove or the fuel

Saiyma’s father, Safarali Gadzai, crouched nearby. Inconsolable, he was supported physically and emotionally by her uncle.

In between the sobbing and tears, he said: 'Yesterday she was OK. She had a little cough and I took her to the doctor. He gave us medicine.

'She even spoke children’s words to him. When she went to sleep she was fine. This morning, I went to check on her, she was under her blanket by the wood burner.

'I went to shake her awake and she was not breathing. I could not afford a decent wood stove or the fuel. The floor was too cold and this is what killed my daughter. She has taken her path and left us alone.'

This is the nearest cemetery to the sprawling Characumba refugee camp and this routine is sadly common during the coldest months.

As the hole nears completion, a tribal elder draws my attention to a fresh grave next to it. Inside lay a three-year-old boy called Janaan. Also from the camp, he like Saiyma, died in his sleep from exposure.

Last goodbyes: Saiyma is tenderly wrapped in cloths and blankets ready for burial at a makeshift cemetery

Sombre: Pashtun men and women gather by the burial ground, the nearest cemetery to the sprawling Characumba refugee camp, where around 90 per cent of residents have fled from the fighting in Helmand

As the men completed the digging, two
dozen more gathered in lines to say prayers for the little girl before 
gently lowering her into her tomb.

A large piece of slate was placed over her shrouded remains before the 
dirt and pebbles were returned to the earth. Finally the mound had two 
upright stones placed at either end.

A
cloth was tied between them to discourage birds from landing on the 
grave. Animals are not welcome in the resting places of such deeply 
superstitious people.

We 
gave Safarali and his brother a lift back to the camp. Upon arrival, we 
navigated the narrow passageways in between the huts to reach the 
Mosque.

The recent snow
had melted quite suddenly turning the streets into sludge. Barely 
distinguishable from the network of open sewers, that ran through their 
centre.

Temporary undertakers: Around half a dozen men used pick axes to dig the grave out of the icy groind on a frozen windswept hill just outside Kabul

Regrettable ritual: As the men completed the digging, two dozen more gathered in lines to say prayers for the little girl before gently lowering her into her tomb

The mud brick buildings of the camp have multiplied year after year since the first tents were pitched eight years ago.

At present the Aschianna NGO estimates that over 1,000 families reside here.

Local
people in Kabul treat them with suspicion. Unlike other internally 
displaced Afghans, the people of Characumba are brought here directly by
the war rather than the more common land disputes.

Ninety
percent of the residents come from Helmand province. The rest, from 
Kandahar. Hailing from the sun burnt fields of the south these people 
fair particularly badly in the bitter Kabul winter.

As
we strode towards the heart of the camp, burka-clad women passed by us.
Usually they would be out of sight hidden from view by deep-set 
traditions.

But today 
Ashianna were operating their tent health clinic so sick children were 
being brought there in their droves by anxious mothers.

The
queue for the facility stretched back into the twisting lanes of the 
city of mud. Other children congregated near two larger tents.

Too common a sight: This routine is sadly a regular occurrence during the coldest months

Fleeing violence: Those attending the funeral live at the sprawling Characumba refugee camp, which currently accommodates around 1,000 families

There are around 460,000 displaced people in Afghanistan, according to the Save The Children charity.

In Kabul alone, there are 55 informal camps, home to more than 30,000 people, including 5,208 families.

An estimated 70 per cent of the Afghan population live in poverty.

The camps in Kabul sprung up spontaneously when displaced people arrived in the capital looking for help, and are not formally run by any agency, although charities like Save the Children provide assistance.

Children under five are most vulnerable to the cold, especially if they are already weakened by malnutrition and poor health.

Last year, more than 40 children died from the cold in one month alone.

Earlier they had attended lessons in two makeshift schools housed in marquees another service provided by Aschianna.

The boys and girls of the camp get a basic education in strict segregation from each other.

More composed now, Safarali poured us tea at the entrance to the Mosque. He was in his late 20s but looked much older.

When
asked how his family came to be in Kabul, he replied: 'We are not here 
for sightseeing. We left Helmand because of the fighting, also there was
no work and we have no land.

'If you carry an ID card and the Taliban stop you, they will claim that you are a spy for the government.

'If
the police find you without one, they will arrest you on suspicion of 
being Taliban or al-Qaeda. I don’t care who is in charge whether the 
government or the Taliban as long as we have peace.'

Asked if he would return if the fighting ceased following the withdrawal of foreign troops in 2014, his answer was surprising.

'There
is no point in going back there,' he said. 'There is no work except 
smuggling, or selling drugs, I cannot do this. Even the work here is 
better.'

Displaced: Unlike other internally displaced Afghans, the people of Characumba are brought here directly by the war rather than the more common land disputes

Superstition: Finally the mound had two upright stones placed at either end with a cloth tied between them to discourage birds from landing on the grave

Like most men from the displacement camps he relied on casual labouring work from the market places around Kabul, though work was rare and poorly paid.

He said: 'Each morning I get up early and go to Hodkhail (a local labour market), If I find work, then I can earn around 200 afghanis ($4).

'It costs me one hundred to travel there and back so I am left with just one hundred to support my family. From this I must buy food, firewood, tea and medicine.'

To add to the desperation of Safarali and other men in his position, much of the work would dry up when the snow arrived in the coming weeks.

Building sites cannot operate when the roads are impassable, so their meagre income would wither just as the weather was at its cruellest. 

He concluded with a plea to the government: 'We have lived in this poverty now for five years.

'These living conditions are not suitable for animals. We are tired of moving around we demand and end to the war and a permanent place to live.

'They should be like our parents, instead they neglect us.'

His brother snorted and added: 'They think we are stupid. We know that other countries are sending us money for the things we need. But they are stealing it from us. That is why my niece is dead.'
