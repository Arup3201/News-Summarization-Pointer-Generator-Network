She's the wife of a rock star and long-standing Victoria's Secret Angel, but Lily Aldridge has added another string to her bow by unveiling a fashion range.

The 28-year-old has joined forces with Velvet to design a second clothing collection after her first range for the brand proved super successful.

The SS14 offering is full of colourful body-con dresses, Breton-striped tees and cosy casual jumpers.

'I've loved the whole process. It's every girl's dream to design the perfect wardrobe,' she told the Metro newspaper.

The model explained that she has applied her own sense of style to the line: it features the kind of vibrant neon dresses that she loves to wear.

The collection is full of wardrobe staples, such as a classic pair of jeans or printed sundress, and each item is named after one of her friends.

Naturally, Lily, who got her big break when she 
was photographed by legendary fashion photographer Bruce Weber when she 
was just four years old, models the entire range herself.

Healthy: Lily, who showcases her slender physique in the images, says she practices a ballet routine four times a week (dress, £95)

Lily, who was scouted at 16 and went on the become the face of Abercrombie & Fitch, revealed that she didn't always have dreams of becoming a model.

'I played soccer for ten years. My dad 
is English and played for Arsenal’s junior team and was really into it 
so I thought that was what I was going to do,' she told the paper.

But, with a father who designed album covers for The Rolling Stones and Elton John, two model sisters and world-renowned photographer Miles for a half-brother, fashion is clearly in Lily's blood.

The California native has been a 
Victoria's Secret model since 2009, and she has also walked the runway 
for Rag & Bone and Giles Deacon and appeared in ads for Coach, 
Clinque and Anthropologie.

Her husband also happens to be Kings of Leon frontman Caleb Followill and she couldn't speak more highly of him.

'I knew he liked me, so I played it cool. I never exchanged numbers as I just knew we were going to see each other again.'

She was right - four years later, they were married.

'We’re so compatible; he’s the coolest guy I’ve ever met, and my best friend', she told Net-a-porter.

The couple live on a farm in Nashville with their one-year-old daughter Dixie Pearl and Lily maintains that her health regime is fairly relaxed.

'I do a ballet routine four times a week, that's really all. I eat a lot of organic foods, I cook, I indulge. You have to balance and have what's good for you,' she told Grazia.

It seems that this is just the start of the model's grand design plans. She hopes to follow in the footsteps of fellow Angels Miranda Kerr and Gisele Bündchen by launching her own lifestyle brand.

'I want to create an organic beauty line, a fashion line and I’d love to do kidswear,' she added.
