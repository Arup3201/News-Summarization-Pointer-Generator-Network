A nursery has been closed and police are investigating amid claims that a child there was force-fed.

The Park Town Nursery in Oxford had its registration suspended by Ofsted over concerns for the welfare of children following allegations of assault.

Police yesterday declined to elaborate on the nature of the alleged incidents, although sources close to the investigation said they were not of a sexual nature.

However, sources close to the £50-a-day nursery said the incident related to a child being forced to finish his dinner.

The unit, which caters for 24 children aged three months to five years, is situated in the grounds of the exclusive Dragon School, where alumni include Emma Watson and Hugh Laurie.

One source said: ‘For whatever reason, a boy did not want to eat what was served up at meal time and he was told he would have to.

‘It is a very unfortunate incident. Pre-school children can be fussy eaters, there is nothing unusual in the boy’s conduct.

‘What is unusual is that for whatever reason, a member of staff decided he would be made to eat this meal.

‘I feel sorry for Sara Mander, the proprietor. She is a totally dedicated professional.’

Dr Ying Groves, whose son George now attends Lynams, the Dragon School pre-prep, said: ‘It’s very surprising because the teacher accused of force-feeding is our favourite.

Proprietor, Sara Mander, claimed the allegations were 'nothing major' and is confident the nursery will be open again before the end of the year

‘She is a very calm, gentle person, but maybe she was force-feeding a child so somebody called in Ofsted. I think there was some shouting at the children as well. They just shut straight away after that. We are just shocked. Our experience of the nursery has only been a positive one.’

Mrs Mander, a married mother of three, claimed the allegations were ‘nothing major’ when she was contacted by a local news agency reporter on Thursday.

She said she was confident the centre would re-open before the end of the year. She twice hung up the telephone when contacted by the Daily Mail.

A police spokesman said: ‘Thames Valley Police attended a nursery in Bardwell Road, Oxford, alongside other agencies on November 18.

‘This was in response to information received about the care of children at the nursery.

‘Officers and representatives from other agencies spoke to the parents of the children. Thames Valley Police is investigating the circumstances and this investigation is ongoing. There have not been any arrests.’

The force declined to comment on the force-feeding allegation.

At its most recent Ofsted inspection, in 2012, the nursery was rated ‘good’. The watchdog confirmed it had suspended the nursery following claims that ‘raised concerns about children’s welfare and the leadership and management of the nursery’, but declined to comment further.

Ian Caws, bursar at Dragon School, said: ‘The nursery is an independent business, which leases its facilities from the Dragon School. As we have no involvement in its management we have no knowledge of the reasons for its closure by Ofsted and no right to demand it.’

The Daily Mail was unable to contact the staff member said to be responsible for forcing the child to eat his dinner.
