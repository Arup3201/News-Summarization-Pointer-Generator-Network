Neil Warnock is hoping to end his 16-month managerial exile after holding talks with Huddersfield Town over their vacant position.

The former QPR boss was sacked by Leeds United in April last year and is keen to get back into the game.

Although the Terriers are seen as a club in crisis after the abrupt exit of Mark Robins following the opening day mauling at the hands of Bournemouth, Warnock would have no qualms rejoining his old side.

The 65-year-old managed Huddersfield between 1993 and 1995 before eventually moving on to take charge in the Premier League later in his career.

Warnock will link-up with Kevin Blackwell should he land the job at the besieged Championship club, who have made huge strides off the pitch in recent years in order to create an infrastructure capable of handling the rigours of English football’s second tier.

Blackwell would become assistant manager at the John Smith’s Stadium 20 years after playing under Warnock in Yorkshire.

The ex-Leeds and Sheffield United gaffer was relieved of his duties at League Two Bury last October.
