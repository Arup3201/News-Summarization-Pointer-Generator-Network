Universities will struggle to fill their places because teenagers are increasingly choosing vocational courses instead of traditional A-levels, a report warned today.

Teenagers face finding it harder to win degree course places because growing numbers are shunning A-levels in favour of options such as BTECs - perhaps to dodge attempts to make A-levels tougher.

As the popularity of A-levels has dipped, the number of top A* grades awarded has slumped nine per cent in just two years.

Universities are now preparing to look elsewhere in the European Union for undergraduates amid increasing competition among campuses for home-grown students.

The trends emerged in a report for vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK (UUK) just a week before sixth-formers across the country receive their A-level results.

It reveals that universities have identified ‘key challenges’ in their efforts to recruit enough students to courses.

These include a decline in the overall population of teenagers and ‘changes in entry qualifications’ including a shift towards BTEC qualifications.

While demand for university appears to have recovered since £9,000-a-year tuition fees were imposed, there is forecast to be a ‘weakening in demand’ for full-time degrees among ‘traditional populations’.

The report notes that A-levels are still the most widely-held qualification among young entrants to university, with 56.6 per cent declaring them as their highest qualification.

But it also reveals that the number of A-level exams taken by UK candidates declined 1.9 per cent between 2011 and 2013, with top A* and A grades falling particularly sharply – by nine per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively.

This year’s results are expected to show a steeper fall in entries of about three per cent.

But the proportion being accepted to university with BTECs has nearly doubled in five years, from three per cent in 2008 to 5.8 per cent in 2013.

The trend towards BTECs will dismay traditionalists who see them as easy alternatives to A-levels. One teacher has labelled them the qualification equivalent of a ‘sub-prime mortgage’.

Some have predicted a growth in BTEC numbers as pupils attempt to avoid reforms to A-levels set in train by former Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Pupils already have fewer chances to resit and revamped A-levels being phased in from next year will feature a return to end-of-course exams instead of bite-sized modules and new demanding content compiled by universities.

The report warns that ‘changes in student attainment’ have been identified by vice-chancellors as a ‘potential challenge for recruitment in future’.

‘In particular vice-chancellors noted the shifting balance between traditional qualifications for entry into higher education, such as A-levels, and other level three qualifications,’ it said.

Universities face further turbulence due to Government moves to unleash market forces in higher education, which will remove a strict cap on recruitment and allow private providers to compete with established institutions.

They will increasingly look elsewhere in the EU to ensure their courses are filled, it emerged.

‘A number of vice-chancellors noted undergraduate recruitment from the EU as a potential opportunity for growth, particularly in the context of increased competition among higher education institutions, and decreasing supply of UK-domiciled undergraduates due to the demographic dip in young students,’ the report said.

The report follows warnings from UCAS, the university admissions service, that pupils with BTEC qualifications were practically guaranteeing rejection from top universities, and limiting progression at middle-ranking institutions.

Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to hold vocational qualifications, which were virtually shunned by independent schools.

Mary Curnock Cook, UCAS chief executive, warned last year it was ‘quite clear that higher-tariff institutions want to recruit those with academic qualifications such as A-levels’.

‘I think it’s worth thinking about - if you have a done a BTEC in health and social care, you are very likely to progress on to a course in higher education in health and social care whereas if you’ve got three A-levels, you’ve got a choice of probably literally thousands of different courses to choose from. So it’s also a narrower progression route,’ she said.

And she warned: ‘We all know about new tougher, more rigorous A-levels and these indeed might be desirable in themselves but I can’t help anticipating that a public understanding that A-levels are getting more difficult is likely to increase this big trend towards vocational qualifications that we’ve seen.’

Earlier this year, she said applications received by UCAS indicated a further drop in the total of students predicted to score three A grades this summer.

‘Taking into account the shrinking population, in five years’ time there could be 10,000 fewer English 19–year–olds with Alevels and more than 20,000 more holding vocational qualifications. The trend could restrict recruitment at more selective universities,’ she said.

The report coincided with separate research which delivered a stark warning to the Government over its policy of scrapping controls on student numbers and allowing universities to recruit as many undergraduates as they like.

The Higher Education Policy Institute cautioned that costs could ‘spiral’ and the policy had been ‘put together quickly and remains fuzzy'.
