For Jose Mourinho, it does not matter if his team summon a thrilling response in Paris in the Champions League or finish the Barclays Premier League campaign with a flourish. His mind is made up.

Some of this Chelsea squad do not have the ‘personality’ required to perform at Stoke, West Bromwich Albion or Crystal Palace, according to a manager who promised to perform ‘surgery’ in the transfer market.

After his strikers failed to score in the defeat at Palace on Saturday, Mourinho warned them that a new centre forward would arrive in the summer — Atletico Madrid’s Diego Costa is thought to be the top target — and those not ready to compete can go.

‘It is clear to everybody that Chelsea next year want to bring a striker,’ said Mourinho. ‘What’s the future for the others? The ones who are staying are competing with the striker we are bringing in.

‘It is normal at the end of the season if players who are not playing a lot or players who are not happy and prefer a change will go. That is also part of the market.

‘We want to improve the team and the players and make some surgical movements in the transfer window. It is also clear we want to improve our players.

‘I can’t and I don’t need to improve Ivanovic, Cahill or Terry, but there are others I need to improve. We are doing that step by step. But that’s not enough to be champions.’

This was Palace’s first Premier League 
win over Chelsea. Their last league victory over their London rivals was
 in August 1990 in the old Division One.

The Chelsea manager warned it would make no difference if his team win in France against Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday.

‘Paris is the kind of match they feel comfortable to play,’ said Mourinho. ‘It is a big match in a great stadium against opponents of top quality and a referee who stops the game and doesn’t let aggression into the game. I prefer the English ones but normally this is the profile of referee in UEFA competitions.

‘I do not need to do a lot. They will be fine. They will be in their natural habitat in that match. They can do a good match there.’

As for the final six games of the season, he added: ‘The easiest thing to do is to perform when you are not playing for something big. If, in the last part of the season, we have an unbelievable performance and some player is going to perform in a beautiful way, that’s easy.

‘The difficult thing is to perform when you feel the heat. Because of that some are big and some are not so big.’

It will merely prove the manager’s point if his team react in Paris. He has written off the Barclays  Premier League title and believes Chelsea must add the fighting spirit they generated when he won the title in 2005 and 2006.

After Saturday’s defeat at Crystal Palace, Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta slumped on to the turf, dejected. John Terry looked distraught after heading in the own goal which settled the game.

‘It feels like the end, that it is over,’ said Cahill. ‘It is massively disappointing and at the end of the game, it was a horrible feeling.’

Mourinho marched on to the pitch, making a beeline for Cahill and hauled him up, put an arm around him and told him to leave with his head held high.

‘I told him he was one of the guys who should not be on the floor,’ said Mourinho. ‘I told him he was one of the guys who should walk to the dressing room with pride, that he had another performance where he gave absolutely everything.

‘I don’t think it’s down to courage. It’s down to the qualities that make personality profiles. You have some players for everything and other players who are in their habitat in some circumstances.

‘So, Stamford Bridge is better than away. Playing away against Arsenal, City, United or Liverpool is one thing and another thing is to play at Crystal Palace, West Bromwich or Stoke City. Clearly, we have players who are up and down in relation to the profile of the match.’

This defeat was Chelsea’s fifth in the League this season. All of them have come away from home against teams outside the top four and — but for the one at Stoke in December — all without scoring a goal.

Despite Mourinho saying he has given up on the title, it remains tight at the top, unlike the last two seasons, when Chelsea trailed 14 points behind the champions last year and 25 points behind in 2012.

The Chelsea boss said: ‘To be where we are is an important step and, when you are there, you have in the back of your mind the little feeling that you can still do it, but the reality is different.’

Mourinho does not expect Samuel Eto’o (hamstring) to make the Paris match and Ashley Cole is out with a knee problem. Ramires, banned against Palace, will return but Nemanja Matic and Mohamed Salah are ineligible.

Jose Mourinho warned his team to prepare for surgery in the summer after concluding that some simply do not have the personality to compete for the Barclays Premier League title. Who’s for the chop?

David LuizHooked after 45 minutes in midfield on Saturday. Mourinho prefers others and knows he can bank more than £30m for the Brazilian. Barcelona and Bayern Munich are interested.

Fernando TorresNot scored a Premier League goal since January. Chelsea would accept offers close to £20m. Inter Milan are interested, but do not value him so highly.  Sky-high wages would be a problem too.

John Mikel ObiAmong those Mourinho claims will probably want to leave if they are not in the team. Inter also interested in him.

Demba BaDistant third among Mourinho’s three strikers this season. There won’t be a shortage of takers for a proven goalscorer.

Ashley ColeOut injured and seems unlikely to be encouraged to stay. Mourinho has been using Cesar Azpilicueta at left back this season.

Samuel Eto’oEto’o fits the profile of those Mourinho accuses of not turning up for humdrum fixtures ... but can Jose afford to let ALL his strikers go?

Romelu LukakuYet to be told where he stands but Mourinho is not keen on his style. Spurs head list of Premier League clubs queueing up to sign him.
