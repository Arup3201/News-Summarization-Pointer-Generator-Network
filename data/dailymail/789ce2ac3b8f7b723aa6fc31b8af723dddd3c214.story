Two new houses, which are just four metres deep, are being built on a cramped derelict plot - and could be sold for up to £500,000 each.

The development, on a patch of land 29 metres long, is in upmarket Clifton, in Bristol, where space for new property is in short supply.  

The houses - the length of a VW Polo - will have two storeys of living space and two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen area and a bathroom plus storage space.

This tiny plot of land in upmarket  Clifton, Bristol, will have two houses built, each just four metres deep

The houses, which are as deep as the length of a VW Polo, will feature two storeys of living space each

They will also have flat roofs with solar panels - but no rear windows because of the tall retaining wall behind them.

The total depth of the plot is 4m - compared to the 3.97m of a Polo - but inside the houses will be even smaller because of the thickness of the outside walls.

Local estate agents say when finished they each could fetch up to £425,000.

Bristol City Council turned down a previous scheme three years ago because it proposed three houses on the site.

But planners have now agreed there are no good reasons for turning down the revised plan for two houses side by side. 

The depth of the plots are four metres, but once built, they will be even narrower because of thick outer walls

The site once formed part of a large quarry and there is a steep drop from the back of the existing houses to this plot.

Planning agent Colin Pemble said despite the narrow width of the site, the homes would provide a similar amount of space to a home with a more conventional design.

He said: 'If you think of a modern executive house, the depth of the rooms is unlikely to be more than about four metres.

'Instead of having rooms back-to-back in the traditional way, in this case, we have got them side by side.'

He added that the design meant there was enough space to meet the council's planning regulations.

It has not yet been made clear when the homes will be built or when they will become available on the market.
