This is the shocking moment a heartless thief scams a shopper out of her bank card at a cashpoint.

CCTV footage shows the swindler appearing to help his elderly victim as he leans over to tell her the ATM  is broken.

As he speaks to the  woman, he uses a piece of paper to cover the the screen in order to secretly cancel her transaction. He is then seen pocketing her card.

Police are currently investigating more than 20 similar distraction thefts across the West Midlands in a con which has already costs victims £9,000.

The thieves are thought to be working in a group of three and officers believe they may be travelling from London to carry out their crimes.

After distracting the cashpoint user, the conmen - who have also memorised the person's pin by looking over their shoulder - go on to use the card to withdraw hundreds from the bank account.

Since receiving the first reports of the new tactic last October, officers have circulated CCTV of the suspects to other forces in a bid to trace them and have been trawling road cameras to find vehicles involved, but are yet to identify the culprits.

The man who approaches people at the cashpoints is described as Asian with a neatly trimmed beard, who always wears a hat.

Detective Constable Christine Hammond is investigating the offences. She said: 'We're determined to find those responsible for these thefts but in the meantime, we're keen to spread the word and let people know what's happening so they can take steps to protect themselves.

'If you're at a cashpoint and someone approaches you, don't take their word for it that the machine isn't working. Simply ignore them and carry on as you are, making sure you keep your pin covered at all times.

'If you do spot any suspicious activity like this, then please call police straight away and - if you see them getting in and out of any vehicles - make a note of any registration numbers.

'Sadly, it's often older people - the most vulnerable in our society - who are the target of these crimes and I would urge anyone with information to call us on 101, or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.'
