A man who tried to climb out of a broken down lift after prising open the doors ended up falling five floors to his death down the lift shaft.

The 27-year-old, who has been named locally as Craig Jones, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, was in the lift, in a block of flats in Bolton city centre, with a friend when it became stuck between the fourth and fifth floors.

It is understood the pair decided to prise open the lift doors after one of them sounded the alarm and nothing happened.

Craig Jones, 27, died after falling five floors to his death when he tried to climb out of a broken down lift at a block of flats in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Police said his death was not being treated as suspicious

However, on trying to get out of the broken down lift, Mr Jones fell through the gap and plummeted five floors to the bottom of the lift shaft.

Emergency services were called to the Marsden Road flats at about 4.50pm on Saturday after Mr Jones' friend escaped unharmed and raised the alarm. 

Mr Jones, a plasterer, was taken to Salford Royal Hospital but was pronounced dead about five hours later. 

It is understood Mr Jones had lived in the block of flats, called Marsden House, for several years.

Carl Whittaker, a parking attendant at the opposite St Edmund's Street Car Park, said he knew Mr Jones by sight as he kept his van there.

He said: 'He was a nice lad. I have spoken to him a number of times.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said a trauma technician administered CPR to Mr Jones at the scene before he was taken to hospital. However, he died from his injuries about five hours later

'I was shocked when I heard. I can picture his face. He came in every day at 5pm when he got back from work.

'I just can't get my head round how he came to fall down the gap.'

Tributes to Mr Jones have poured in on social media, with Jade Oldham posting on Facebook: 'Words cannot even describe how devastated I am tonight! Lost the nicest person in the world!

'Couldn't even think of a bad word to say about Pugs! Love and miss you so much! Xxxxxxxx.'

Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and said details had been passed to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).

An HSE spokesman said: 'That incident has been reported to us and we are currently making enquiries.'
