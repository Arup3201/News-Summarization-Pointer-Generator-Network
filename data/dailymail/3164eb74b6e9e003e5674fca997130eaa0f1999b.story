When Russet was gifted with a delicious bone to gnaw on, little did she know the challenges she would soon face.

The three-year-old English Bulldog decided to go outside to enjoy her treat one morning, but a huge obstacle stood in her way...the door flap.

In this farcical video, taken by her highly amused owner, you can see just how persistent a peckish pet can be. 

At first, Russet is standing in front of the backdoor while she grips the center of the bone in her mouth and contemplates his next move.

She decides to just go for it but finds that she's unable to fit the bone through the narrow door-flap as it keeps getting trapped in the process. 

After many attempts, she quickly learns that maneuvering it while its in the horizontal position is not going to work due to its width.

The big challenge: Russet the bulldog struggles to fit her wide bone through the narrow door-flap..but she deserves an A for effort

So she does what any smart bulldog would do and drops the bone before leaping through the flap alone.

But don't fret, she hasn't forgotten her prized possession and is hardly ready to give up so easily!

The persistent pet immediately reaches her head back into the house and tries, once again, to yank the bone across from the other side to no avail. 

Thinking outside the box: The persistant pet tries from both sides of the flap, but alas, her attempts keep failing

Flap door? More like trap door!  

But, with much effort and some logical thinking, things suddenly start to click for Russet.

She grabs the end of the bone with her teeth, enabling her to drag the bone through the flap sideways.  

Success, she's cracked the code! 

Let's hope she remembers his technique so she can bring the bone back home with her. 

Clever doggy! This position is much better and she is finally able to pull the bone outside
