New evidence in the Jodi Arias trial shows that she may have been trying to influence the testimony of her friend by slipping out coded messages while she was in jail for her ex-boyfriend's murder.

The Phoenix courtroom was shown a picture of the bottom of a page of one of the magazines that she handed a visitor who it is thought was meant to pass it along to another person who was going to testify on Arias' behalf.

The picture shows numbers written at the bottom of a page in her copy of Star Magazine, that were intended to match messages that she had written on the corresponding page numbers from the second magazine, Digital Photo Pro.

'You f***ed up what you told my attorney the next day / directly contradicts what I've been saying for over a year / get down here ASAP and see me before you talk to them again and before / you testify so / we can fix this / interview was excellent! Must talk ASAP!' the message read when pieced together.

Grilling: Jodi Arias, pictured on the stand on Monday, gave testimony for the tenth day where she was harshly questioned by the prosecution over her various versions of events

The evidence is intended to show that 
she tried to manipulate one of the few people who could theoretically 
corroborate her story about being abused by Alexander.

The date of the magazine incident and 
the interviews scheduled around that time point to the prospect of the 
recipient being her friend and former boyfriend Matt McCartney.

When presented with the magazine codes on Thursday, Arias denied trying to sway McCartney.

'You tried to get someone to lie at that hearing, didn't you?' prosecutor Juan Martinez said.

'No, she responded.

Her trust and the veracity of McCartney's knowledge was brought up again when the trial picked back up on Monday.

His name was mentioned when she said that she showed bruises that she sustained from one of her fights with Alexander.

'I saw (McCartney) a few days later and he called me out on all the bruises that were on me,' she said in court.

After going back and forth with 
Martinez over the specific timing and driving directions that she went 
through during this supposed trip- when she traveled from Alexander's 
house in Mesa, Arizona to McCartney's house in Seaside, California, it 
was eventually determined that he would not have been able to see the 
bruising.

Though the prosecutor asserts that it 
was because of the timeline of the trip, she said that she also applied 
multiple coats of makeup to avoid any questioning.

The 32-year-old eventually admitted 
that there is no physical evidence, documentary or anecdotal evidence 
that Alexander hurt her.

Martinez also questioned her motive in
moving to Mesa after she and Arias had officially broken up. She went 
on to say that Alexander was very 'persuasive' and convinced her to 
still move even though they were no longer together.

Arias' grueling tenth day on the stand was part of criminal proceedings that have been going on since early January.

Arias, 32, lost a bid last week aimed 
at getting a reprieve from a potential death sentence if convicted of 
first-degree murder after the Arizona Supreme Court swiftly denied her 
motion that claimed a detective committed perjury in the case. Her 
attorneys have filed multiple motions for mistrials, all of which have 
been denied.

Negotiations: The prosecution and defense have fought bitter battles over evidence and approached the judge's bench on several occasions on Monday

Earlier in Monday's testimony, Arias 
was grilled about her decision to send Alexander's grieving grandmother 
flowers following his murder.

The court viewed a tape of Arias' 48 
Hours interview where she said that she had sent the flowers to 
Alexander's grandmother 'because iris was one of Travis' 'favorite baby 
names'.

She went on to send an 18-page note to his siblings.

In the note, she said that they 
'deserved to know' who killed their brother by shooting him and stabbing
him 27 times. She left out any mention of her involvement- which she 
has now admitted to in court.

The prosecutor asked why she lied to 
Detective Flores when she denied being in Arizona on June 4, 2008. Arias
said she had lied because she was ashamed of things that she and 
Alexander had done in the past that she wanted to keep secret.

Martinez kept at Arias over her 
motives for lying. He picked apart her often contradictory responses and
questioned her memory of events, even opening his examination on the 
tenth day of the trial by asking: 'Ma'am, you have a problem with 
telling the truth, don't you?'

The lawyer then picked apart each of the versions of events that Arias had told to friends following Mr Alexander's murder.

Arias was grilled on her conflicting 
testimony on Monday where she both appeared to say that she knew and 
didn't know Alexander was dead when she left his Mesa home on June 4.

She told the jury that her 'mind 
wasn't right' as to why she had could not remember clearly the events or
why she had been covered in blood when she drove from Arizona to Utah 
to visit a romantic interest, Ryan Burns.

Martinez said: 'And to continue this litany of lies, it isn't restricted to Utah. You also lied to people in Arizona.'

She responded: 'I lied to everyone.'

When Arias was told by friend Daniel 
Freeman that her former boyfriend had been murdered, she pretended she 
knew nothing about it.

She then called a spiritual adviser 
Bishop Leighton to find out what he knew about Alexander's death, a move
that Martinez claimed was 'to see if someone was on to you'.

The murder suspect then added that she could not remember much from that day of June 4.

Referring to the fateful day at 
Alexander's house Martinez asked: 'You remembered the confrontation, you
remembered that you didn't call 911, so why did you need to know 
second-hand knowledge?

Last week, prosecutor Martinez 
hammered Arias with intense questioning about her inability to recall 
crucial details in the case, yet noted it was puzzling that she can 
remember 'what kind of coffee you bought at Starbucks sometime back in 
2008'.

Despondent: It was another day under close scrutiny for the murder suspect in the Arizona courtroom

Damning words: Pages for Arias' own diary were used by the prosecution to contradict claims that Alexander had been physically violent towards her during their relationship

Arias smirked at times while Martinez 
stammered in frustration, and the judge admonished both to stop talking 
over each other as the questioning grew heated and the two traded barbs.

Arias first told authorities she knew 
nothing about Alexander's death, then later blamed it on masked 
intruders before eventually settling on self-defense.

She said she was scared of being 
arrested, had been contemplating suicide and didn't want to sully 
Alexander's name with accounts of his violent behavior and lurid details
of their sexual relationship, given his public persona as a devout 
Mormon who was saving himself for marriage.

Of the day she killed Alexander, Arias
says she remembers him in a rage, body slamming her and chasing her 
around his home. She said she grabbed a gun from his closet, and fired 
it as they tussled, but didn't know if she hit him.

She had no explanation for the 27 stab
and slash wounds he suffered, or his slit throat, or how his body ended
up stuffed in his shower.

According to court records, however, 
she previously told police before her trial began that Alexander was 
unconscious after she shot him, but then 'crawled around and was 
stabbed'.

She says she remembers putting a knife
in the dishwasher and disposing of the gun in the desert as she drove 
from Arizona on her way to Utah. She immediately began planning an 
alibi.

Arias' grandparents reported a .25 
caliber handgun stolen from their Northern California house about a week
before the killing - the same caliber used to shoot Alexander - but 
Arias claims to know nothing about the burglary. She says she brought no
weapons to Alexander's home on the day she killed him, undercutting the
prosecution's theory of premeditation.
