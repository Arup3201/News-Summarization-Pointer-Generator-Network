Charged: Former PCSO Peter Bunyan is on trial at Taunton Crown Court, charged with abusing his position to have affairs with five women and having sex with them while on duty

A married PSCO confessed to sleeping with one woman up to 10 times while he was supposed to be on uniform foot patrol.

Peter Bunyan, 40, admitted wasting police time, but insisted he had not neglected his duty because he kept his radio on.

Father-of-two Bunyan is said to have conducted illicit affairs with five women he met on his beat with Devon and Cornwall police.

He denies 12 charges of misconduct in a public office but conceded that he had been 'negligent' in failing to attend to his duty.

Bunyan said that most of the affairs were carried out before, during or after his shift and had never got in the way of his duty.

But he admitted at Taunton Crown Court to sleeping with one lover up to 10 times while he was supposed to be on daytime foot patrol in her neighbourhood.

Bunyan described how his beat would take him past the address of the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and he repeatedly called in to continue their affair.

He told the jury: 'I tended to see her during the day time. I was on duty a lot of the time.

'I would have been in full uniform with my radio on, I was supposed to be on foot patrol. I was not taking advantage of my position, I don't feel I was doing that at all.

'I would not say I was abusing my position but I was not doing what I should have been doing.

'I admit was wasting police time and being negligent and not attending to my duty.'

He claimed: 'I never turned my radio down, on the occasion when someone did call I would answer it and leave straight away. I would attend all calls when required.

'I accept that by being in the house I was failing to do my duty and not attending to my duties, but I always answered my radio.

'For most occasions I wouldn't have 
had my radio on me because I was not in uniform and not on duty, it 
would have been back at the station.'

On trial: Police community support officer Peter Bunyan (pictured, left, outside court and, right, in his uniform) is accused of using highly sensitive police data to strike up affairs with vulnerable women while on duty

Bunyan agreed that over the course of
the affairs there were times he failed to correctly fill in police 
notebooks and records and even days which were left blank.

The police community support officer 
is also accused of using the police database ‘as a dating agency’ to 
have affairs with single mothers and domestic abuse victims while on 
duty.

The court heard that he used the 
Criminal Information System to research his lovers - one up to 17 times -
and obtain their mobile phone records.

Prosecutor Simon Burns told the Court yesterday: ‘If he was not in uniform or on duty, there would not be a trial.

‘But
if on duty or in his uniform he should have been at work but he was in 
bed with somebody, he was not exercising his proper role as a police 
officer.

‘You do not use the criminal intelligence system as a dating agency.’

But he told the court he had never 
used the database to conduct 'welfare checks' on vulnerable women or 
take numbers from the files and use them to start a relationship.

Redruth police station, where Bunyan would openly view explicit pictures of his victims

He added that if his searches were 
related to women he was having affairs with he would immediately hand 
them to a superior officer to handle.

Bunyan admitted keeping a secret mobile phone at the station but denied any wrongdoing and being in 
full uniform when conducting the affairs with all five women.

He said on most occasions he visited them before or after work when he was casually dressed and his uniform was at his base.

Mr Burns said Bunyan’s first affair was with a woman who
was later sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The woman previously 
had reason to call the police following a dispute with someone.

Another
woman struck up a relationship with Bunyan after he went to her home to
take a witness statement when she was a victim of domestic violence.

The
couple developed a relationship, which in one case saw Bunyan collect 
the single mother from a firework display and take her to a 
neighbourhood police office where they had sex.

Bunyan is said to have 'encouraged' 
the women to post naked pictures of themselves - some pornographic - to 
his local police station.

Colleagues of the PCSO told the jury 
how he 'clearly appreciated' the images, which were sent on CDs and 
viewed by Bunyan on the police computer at Redruth police station. 

Bunyan admits having consensual sex with four women while off duty and denies sex with a fifth woman.

Bunyan denies 12 counts of misconduct in a public office and his trial is expected to last up to three weeks.

The trial continues.
