Kris Jenner has someone she’d like her daughter Kourtney Kardashian's partner Scott Disick to call: Her pastor!

The momager was all smiles in the premiere episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians on Sunday night when Kourtney, 35, confirmed that she is indeed pregnant with her third child with Scott, 31.

They are already the parents of four-year-old son Mason and daughter Penelope, 23 months.

Not married, three children: And then there were five. Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick have been together for eight years and have two children, soon to be three. But the numbers don't add up for Kris Jenner. She thinks they ought to commit to each other by getting married

Calling the shots: Kris Jenner brings a smile to LAX this afternoon as she gets ready to fly out of town. She's delighted to be a grandma again, but want Kourtney and Scott to seal the deal

But although momager Kris is thrilled she’s going to be a grandma again in December; behind the scenes she’s not so thrilled that her daughter and her boyfriend of the past eight years have still not made it down the aisle. 

‘Committing to parent three kids, when you haven’t even committed to each other doesn’t cut it in Kris’s book,’ says a family friend. ‘She comes from a time when, if a girl got pregnant and was still single, she got married as soon as possible.

'And although she understands times have changed, she still has religious values and feels it’s only right that Scott make an "honest woman" out of her little girl.’

In fact, 58-year-old Kris regularly attends church services at the California Community Church in Agoura Hills, California - a church founded by… her. She used to attend a Baptist Church in Westlake where she listened to sermons by Rev. Brad Johnson.

Married, no children: They've split now, but Khloe Kardashian married Lamar Odem even though they didn't have kids. The ceremony was presided over by pastor Brad Johnson, the man Kris would like to perform Kourtney's ceremony

Married, one child: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West waited only a year after baby North was born before they walked down an Italian aisle last month

But when the pastor resigned in disgrace over his affair with a mistress – who he has since married – Kris tracked him down at his new job serving up coffee at Starbucks, and made him an offer he couldn’t refuse.

Now they are partners in a church that boasts giving people second chances.

But besides that, he can marry people. In fact, he performed the September 2009 marriage ceremony between Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom, making him only a phone call away should Scott and Kourtney decide to tie the knot.

Kourtney and Scott have been together since 2006. And although he bought her a ring in 2011 he says she is the one who didn’t want to get married.

‘Up until now Kourtney hasn’t been interested in getting married, but at 35, she’s beginning to feel it’s time. She’s expecting the couple’s third child and if Scott would agree to a small, quiet ceremony – nothing like the one Kim just had – I think she’d be up for it.'

Pressure: If Kris has anything to say about it, Kourtney and Scott will be married by the time the new baby is born. Says a family friend: 'Maybe there's still a part of Kourtney that wants to make sure that at 31, Scott has outgrown his bad behavior before she agrees to make it legal'

But suddenly Scott is saying, ‘Why fix it if it’s not broken?’ so the subject of marriage once again seems at a standstill.

Kris on the other hand fears the old adage still rings true; why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?’ And she says if Kourtney doesn’t stand up to Scott and insist on a wedding, she’ll end up a lonely 40-year-old woman with three kids and no husband.

‘It’s no secret that Scott and Kourtney have had their share of ups and downs,’ adds the source. ‘All you have to do is watch their reality show to know that. He’s been arrested for DUI, he’s been in and out of rehab, and he’s had anger issues where he’s put his fist through a mirror while arguing with Kourtney.

‘So maybe there’s still a part of Kourtney that wants to make sure that at 31, Scott has outgrown his bad behavior and is ready to be a proper husband, before she agrees to make it legal.’

Not a great holiday? Meanwhile, Scott was seen leaving his Hamptons house with a Louis Vuitton duffel bag Monday
