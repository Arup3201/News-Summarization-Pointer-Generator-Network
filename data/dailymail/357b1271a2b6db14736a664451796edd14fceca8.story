With little signs of wear and tear, these kitsch, brightly coloured façades look like they could be straight of a period film set.

But in fact they show what people in the Ukrainian capital Kiev have dubbed the 'millionaires' ghost town': 42 acres of mock-19th-Century buildings that sit all but empty in the heart of the city.

The development in Vozdvyzhenka was conceived of a decade ago as a desirable, upmarket neighbourhood for the city's wealthy residents.

Millionaires' ghost town: The brightly coloured 
luxury development in Vozdvizhenka, in Kiev, Ukraine, which has been 
left all but empty after the 2008 banking crash

Good as new: With little signs of wear and tear, these kitsch, brightly coloured façades look like they could be straight of a period film set

Ill conceived: Vozdvyzhenka consists of 42 acres of mock-19th-Century buildings that now sit all but empty in the heart of Kiev

Historic: Od 
Vozdvyzhenka was for centuries a centre for local cottage industries, 
inhabited by potters and skinners after whom many of its new streets are
 now named

... but the district's prime location, 15 minutes from the centre of Kiev, made it a prime target for 
developers keen to transform it into the playground of
 the rich

Then the banking crises of 2008 swept across the planet's economies, plunging Ukraine into a particularly steep downturn and choking demand for luxury housing in Kiev.

Now Vozdvyzhenka lies all but empty, just a fifth of its homes sold and its streets practically deserted save for curious city walkers, wedding photo sessions and the odd music video shoot.

And those who have invested in properties in the development have been badly burned, with the price of an average flat there falling by nearly half since they went on the market.

Prior to the development, old 
Vozdvyzhenka was for centuries a centre for local cottage industries, 
inhabited by potters and skinners after whom many of its new streets are
 now named.

But the 
district's prime location, less than a mile from the centre of the 
capital, made it a prime target for developers and a plan was hatched to
 transform it into the playground of the rich.

Plenty of space: Now Vozdvyzhenka lies all but empty, just
 a fifth of its homes sold and its streets practically deserted save for
 curious city walkers and few workmen

Just missing the tumble weed: Those who have invested in the development have been badly burned, with the price of an average flat there falling by nearly half

Taras Ziabkin, deputy head of Kievgorstroy-1, the developers behind Vozdvyzhenka, told The Guardian: 'We were knocked down in 2008. I will not hide that the demand dropped drastically then.'

But he rejected descriptions, popular among locals, that the development is a 'dead town'. Fifty of its 250 properties have residents, he said, with builders readying another 50 for new tenants.

He added that he expects to sell the remaining 150 apartments by the end of 2014, explaining the site's lack of life with the claim that most owners live abroad and bought their properties as 'investments'.

Waiting for the upturn: An estate agent's phone number is prominently displayed in the hope that some passer-by might be encouraged to rent or buy in the area

Low demand: Just 50 of Vozdvyzhenka's 250 
properties are occupied, but Taras Ziabkin of developers 
Kievgorstroy-1, says builders are readying 50 more for tenants

Good investment? Mr Ziabkin accounts for the site's lack of life with the claim that most owners live abroad and bought their properties as 'investments'

Colourful: Ironically, given the site cleared to make space for it, the Vozdvyzhenka development apes the Baroque and modernist architectural styles of 19th Century Kiev

'Greed': Georgy Duchovychniy, one of Kiev's most
 prominent architects, blames the developers for ruining the historic 
district and predicts it will never be fully inhabited

Shaky: Mr Duchovychniy said that in their pursuit of profit developers threw caution to the wind, adding floors to their plans while disregarding the need to strenghten foundations

Not so comfortable... The result has been a slew of complaints about cracks in the walls, leaky basements and heating breakdowns ever since people started moving in in 2010

Pretty: In their proposal for the regeneration, Kievgorstroy-1 emphasised the district's history and the luxury features they were to include

On the up? Mr Ziabkin claimed that initial problems have since been resolved and that a number of prominent Ukrainians now have homes in the development

However, their presence is yet to be felt in Vozdvyzhenka, where builders and passers-by are more likely to be spotted than the cream of Kiev's high society

But the wisdom of investing in Vozdvyzhenka has been challenged by one of Kiev's most prominent architects, who blames the developers for ruining the historic district and predicts that it will never be fully inhabited.

Georgy Duchovychniy said: 'There are building rules, common sense and there is also a greed which destroys them.'

Ironically, given the site cleared to make space for it, the Vozdvyzhenka development apes the Baroque and modernist architectural styles of 19th Century Kiev.

In their proposal for the regeneration, Kievgorstroy-1 emphasised the district's history and the luxury features they were to include in the buildings and encourage in the community.

Architectural folly: Garages face the luxury flats of Vozdvyzhenka, but there is not a car - nor a soul - in sight

Dead end: Demand for homes in the district dropped dramatically after the banking crisis, but the developers reject local descriptions of the area as a 'ghost town'

Grand: A mansion house is seen with a banner - presumably advertising it for sale - strung across its imposing façade

Picturesque: The wisdom of investing in Vozdvyzhenka has been challenged by one of Kiev's most prominent architects, who blames the developers for ruining the historic district and predicts that it will never be fully inhabited

But Mr Duchovychniy said that in their pursuit of profit developers threw caution to the wind, adding floors to their plans while disregarding the need to strenghten foundations.

The result has been a slew of complaints about cracks in the walls, leaky basements and heating breakdowns reported in local media ever since the first residents moved in three years ago.

Mr Ziabkin told The Guardian that those problems have since been resolved and that a number of prominent Ukrainians now have homes in the development.

However, their presence is yet to be felt in Vozdvyzhenka, where builders and passers-by are more likely to be spotted than the cream of Kiev's high society.

One man told the Guardian how he likes to wander through the 'spacious and deserted area'. He added: 'People who have money for such apartments probably may find better places to live.'
