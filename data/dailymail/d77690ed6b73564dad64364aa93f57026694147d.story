Axe? Fabio Capello spoke out after John Terry was axed as England captain by FA bosses

Major question marks hung over Fabio 
Capello's status as England coach today after he spoke out in defence of
axed skipper John Terry.

There are fears the Italian could quit his job before the European Championships - throwing the team's preparations into jeopardy.

Capello told Italian broadcasters he disagreed with the decision of FA bosses to axe Terry as captain before he has stood trial.

The
decision to axe the England skipper came three months after Capello had been given full authority 
to deal with the Terry issue as he saw fit.

Former FA chief 
executive David Davies today said that the Â£6million-per-year England manager 
may be in breach of contract after he openly challenged the decision to 
strip John Terry of the national team captaincy.

'It is being taken very seriously by the FA because it may be that Fabio Capello has breached his contract,' said Davies.

'You have to ask what his motive is. You have to suspect he wants to 
prevent John Terry retiring as a player before Euro 2012 but there are 
wider issues.

'You could have what some of the media are calling a morality circus 
while England are trying to win the second major tournament in football.

'A contract may have been breached, there is strong leadership now at 
the FA from David Bernstein. Last week he wasn't slow to take things 
forward and he may not be slow to do so now.'

Terry was axed as captain after a court decided he would not face trial over allegations he racially abusing Anton Ferdinand at Loftus 
Road in October until July, after Euro 2012.

Interviewed by national Italian 
broadcaster Rai 1 at Stamford Bridge yesterday afternoon, where he attended 
Chelsea's thrilling 3-3 draw with Manchester United, Capello stated 
openly how angry he was.

Asked whether he was in agreement with 'the Federation's decision re Terry?', Capello replied: 'No, absolutely not.

'I have spoken to the chairman and I 
have said that, in my opinion, one cannot be punished until it's 
official and the court - a non-sporting court, a civil court - has made a
decision to decide if John Terry has done what he has been accused of.

'I thought it was right that Terry should keep the captain's armband.

'The fact that the board has decided in this way is because it falls under the competence regarding ethics.'

Capello is due at Wembley today, 
where he will speak with Bernstein before heading to Anfield for 
Liverpool's Premier League encounter with Tottenham.

This morning bookmakers William Hill slashed odds on the England boss quitting before the Euro 2012 finals get underway in June from 8-1 to 9-2.

However, the fact he did attend yesterday's game as planned would seem to be an indication he wants to continue in his job.

In the stands: John Terry sat out Chelsea's draw with Manchester United yesterday because of injury

Abuse: Rio Ferdinand, left, the brother of Anton Ferdinand and John Terry's partner at centre-back in the England team, was booed by Chelsea supporters yesterday

However, having challenged the FA so 
openly about such a contentious subject, in the process raising the 
potential for fierce disagreement with individual England players, there
has to be a possibility of Capello's tenure ending, four years to the 
day since his first game in charge, a 2-1 win over Switzerland at 
Wembley.

The entire issue of the England captaincy has become a noose around Capello's neck.

A firm believer of the Italian 
mentality where the most experienced player in the squad gets the 
armband, Capello was informed of the symbolic nature of the job in 
England and duly auditioned Terry, Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard for 
the role.

Capello thought he had the right man in the Chelsea skipper.

He was forced to revise that stance 
when an issue in Terry's private life led to Capello demanding his 
presence at Wembley in February 2010, when he was removed as captain and
Rio Ferdinand installed as his replacement.

On trial: Terry is accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand (right) last October in a match at Loftus Road, and will appear in court on July 9

Ferdinand then got injured during the first day of training at the World Cup in South Africa, meaning Gerrard got the job.

Then, after assessing the unseemly 
manner in which the armband was handed around during a friendly win over
Denmark in Copenhagen 12 months ago, Capello decided to give Terry the 
job back again.

Now that decision has exploded in his face once more.

Former England international and now 
outspoken radio pundit Stan Collymore has labelled the situation as 'a 
debacle and a shambles'.

In addition to attending today's 
game at Anfield, Capello has a busy month ahead and is due to name his 
squad on February 25 for the Wembley friendly against World Cup 
finalists Holland four days later.

Steven Gerrard is expected to take the captain's armband for the friendly.
