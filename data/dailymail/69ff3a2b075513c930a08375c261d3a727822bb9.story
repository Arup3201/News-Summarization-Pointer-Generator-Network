Having not been selected in Luiz Felipe Scolari's Brazil squad for the World Cup, Ronaldinho has come up with another way of making some money from this summer's tournament.

The former Barcelona forward has decided to rent out his house in Rio de Janeiro for a hefty £9,120 per night, giving fans a unique opportunity to stay at the home of a Brazilian legend.

Ronaldinho took to Twitter to confirm that his five bedroom property is available to rent via Airbnb.com during this summer's tournament.

Ronaldinho's property, which also includes six bathrooms, is in a gated community in Rio's Barra da Tijuca area.

Anyone with deep enough pockets to afford a night at the home of the 34-year-old will also have access to a sauna, a barbeue, a cellar and a beer fridge.

Ronaldinho-inspired art fills the house, including paintings of the ex-Paris Saint-Germain forward playing for his national team and AC Milan.

A deposit of just over £600 is required to rent the house and smoking is only allowed outside, but a 'service team' will be made available to guests.
