Ancient marine algae fossils may provide clues about how today’s microscopic oceanic organisms will respond to  climate change.

Warming waters affected the growth and skeletal structure of  ancient algae, and scientists hope the findings will deepen their understanding of how life will adapt as Earth's temperature rises.

Coccolithophores, a type of marine algae, are prolific in the ocean today and have been for millions of years.

Researchers found that warming waters affected the growth and skeletal structure of ancient algae. This image shows a scanning electron micrograph of fossil coccolithophore species, Coccolithus pelagicus. The fossil is from New Jersey and is around 56 million years old

The single-celled plankton produce calcite skeletons that are preserved in abundance in seafloor sediments after they die.

Although they are microscopic, their numbers makes them key contributors to marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle. 

For instance, a build up of skeletons contribute to massive structures such as the White Cliffs of Dover.

A study by the University of Southampton has revealed that the growth of coccolithophores is stunted as oceans become more acidic, because of an increase in atmospheric carbon monoxide.

Researchers did not look at the number of algae that may have been affected, so cannot deduce whether changes in their size due to climate change, did, or may, have had an impact on the oceanic food chain.

The study, published in Nature Communications, looked at preserved fossil remains of coccolithophores from a period of climate warming and ocean acidification that occurred around 56 million years ago. This time is known as the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM).

It offers a  long-term view of coccolithophore response to ocean acidification.

Scientists already know that warming waters and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels lead to the acidification of the oceans, which kills off coral (pictured). This study gives experts another organism to study and look for warning signs of damage

Dr Sarah O’Dea, from Ocean and Earth Science said: ‘Our results show that climate change significantly altered coccolithophore calcification rates at the PETM and has the potential to be just as significant, perhaps even more so, today.

‘Ultimately then, it is the factors that influence where species live, their abundance, how fast they grow and their ability to adapt to environmental change that is likely to control future coccolithophore calcite production.’

The study investigated two key ancient coccolithophores - Coccolithus pelagicus and Toweius pertusus - both of which are directly related to species that dominate the modern ocean.

It found that calcification rates of C. pelagicus and T. pertusus halved during the PETM because the environment influenced their growth.

The response of each species was different, and involved intervals of slowed growth in C. pelagicus and an overall reduction in the size of the skeletal components in T. pertusus.

However, there was  little evidence for any response to ocean acidification, other than perhaps a slight thinning of C. pelagicus coccoliths.

Dr O'Dea told MailOnline that smaller and thinner skeletons may mean that algae may be easier prey, but no evidence of this has been found.

A larger question, which the study does not answer, may be that if the creatures have smaller skeletons, animals up the food chain may get less calcium by eating them, which is needed to contract muscle, transmit messages through nerves and releasing hormones - as well as strengthening bones. 

Fish are losing their survival instinct as the world's oceans become more acidic because of climate change, a study released earlier this year claimed.

The research confirmed laboratory experiments showing that the behaviour of reef fish can be seriously affected by increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the ocean.

Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is absorbed into ocean waters, where it dissolves and lowers the pH of the water.

The study was the first to analyse the sensory impairment of fish from carbon dioxide seeps, where pH is similar to what climate models forecast for surface waters by the turn of the century. The pH of normal ocean surface water is around 8.14.

The study examined fish from so-called bubble reefs at a natural CO2 seep in Papua New Guinea, where the pH is 7.8 on average.

With today's greenhouse gas emissions, climate models forecast pH 7.8 for ocean surface waters by 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Experts from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta showed that fish's sensory systems are impaired by ocean acididication in the laboratory.

'They can smell but they can't distinguish between chemical cues,' biologist Danielle Dixson said.

Acidic waters affect fish behavior by disrupting a specific receptor in the nervous system, called GABAA, which is present in most marine organisms with a nervous system. When GABAA stops working, neurons stop firing properly.

Coral reef habitat studies have found that CO2-induced behavioral changes, similar to those observed in the new study, increase mortality from predation by more than fivefold in newly settled fish.

Fish can smell a fish that eats another fish and will avoid water containing the scent.

In Dr Dixson's laboratory experiments, control fish given the choice between swimming in normal water or water spiked with the smell of a predator chose the normal water.

But fish raised in water acidified with carbon dioxide chose to spend time in the predator-scented water.
