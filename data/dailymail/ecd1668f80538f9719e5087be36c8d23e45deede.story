House Speaker John Boehner hasn't been coy about his interest in tackling immigration reform legislation.

Just last week the Republican leader said he was 'hell bent' on doing so before the 113th Congress adjourns at the end of this year, despite facing pressure from members of his caucus not to bring the issue to the House floor.

The Speaker's zeal for getting his Republican colleagues to embrace immigration reform took a sharp turn on Thursday from determination to antagonism, however, when Boehner publicly made fun of his Republican colleagues for being too afraid to confront the issue publicly.

'Here's the attitude. Ohhhh. Don't make me do this. Ohhhh. This is too 
hard,' Boehner said, doing an impression of his Congressional caucus while squealing like a child.

'We get elected to make choices. We get elected to solve problems and 
it's remarkable to me how many of my colleagues just don't want to ... 
They'll take the path of least resistance,' Boehner continued.

'I've had every brick and bat and arrow shot at me over this issue just 
because I wanted to deal with it. I didn't say it was going to be easy.'

During Thursday's event, Boehner also took shot's at national Tea Party groups 'whom purport to represent the Tea Party.'

'I
 made it pretty clear I'll stand with the Tea Party, but I'm not 
standing with these three or four groups in Washington who are using the
 Tea Party for their own personal benefit,' Boehner said.

According to the Cincinnati Enquirer, which first reported the story, Boehner's remarks on Thursday took place at a luncheon in the Ohioan's Congressional District at the Middletown Rotary Club.

Boehner's office tried to frame the Congressman's immigration comments on Friday as playful. Spokesman Brendan Buck told The Huffington Post, 'As the speaker often says to his colleagues, you only tease the ones you love.'

This is the second time in the last seven days that Boehner's nabbed headlines for coming off as a little too eager to pass immigration reform.

After Boehner's 'hell bent' comment at a Las Vegas, Nevada gathering of Republican donors last Thursday, Buck told reporters that 'nothing has changed' and immigration reform wasn't on the table at this time.

'Everyone can tell their editors to chill. The Houseâ€™s focus remains on jobs and the economy,' Buck said in an email to reporters, followed by an on-the-record statement that, 'Nothing has changed.'

'As he's said many times, the Speaker believes 
step-by-step reform is important, but it won't happen until the 
president builds trust and demonstrates a commitment to the rule of law,' Buck's statement read.

Boehner quickly tried to shift gears and get back on message on Friday after his immigration comments made national news. The Speaker announced mid-morning via a video posted to his Facebook page that he would be giving this week's Republican address on behalf of the party.

'We'll be talking about jobs, healthcare and much more,' Boehner says in the video.

Boehner's Facebook audience had most certainly heard about his immigration remarks. Within an hour, the video already had more than 150 unique comments, many of which referenced immigration reform.

'Please include in your speech exactly how rewarding criminals with amnesty will help jobs in Ohio,' Facebook user Seamus Joyce commented below the video.

'No amnesty,' said several others.

While some of the immigration comments on the video were pro-reform, the bulk were not.

'If the Republicans sell us out on 
amnesty, it is game over for liberty in America, Judson Phillips, 
founder of Tea Party Nation said in a fundraising email on Friday.

Boehner's congressional seat is up for re-election this fall, and three Republicans are challenging the Speaker of the House in the party's May 6 primary.

Opponent J.D. Winteregg, a high school French teacher who thinks Boehner has 'electile dysfunction' and has the backing of national Tea Party organization The Tea Party Leadership Fund, asked if Boehner was, 'Auditioning for an MSNBC gig?' in a tweet accompanying a link to the Enquirer's story.
