A man was found dead on 3,560 ft Mount Snowdon after a fall.

The man in his 20s was found by other walkers on a 2,500 ft ridge on the mountain.

The body was found close to a scrambling route known as Parson's Nose, that requires some rock climbing skills.

The walker was pronounced dead yesterday at the scene by a medic in the Sea King helicopter search and rescue crew from nearby RAF Valley in Anglesey.

Mount Snowdon, North Wales is the highest peak in England and Wales at 3560 ft above sea level

The crew, which counts Prince William amongst its rescue pilots, assisted the Llanberis and Aberglaslyn mountain rescue teams with the transfer of the body to hospital in Bangor.

This is the second death on the mountain in the past month.

An ice climber fell to his death on the mountain range over the Easter weekend. He fell more than 100ft down an icy mountain in Snowdonia in treacherous conditions.

The same RAF crew was yesterday called to help the North East Wales search and rescue team after a paraglider was injured in a fall near Llantysilio, Denbighshire.

The paraglider, from Mold in Flintshire, was airlifted to Wrexham Maelor Hospital for treatment.

Sergeant Dickie Myers, of RAF Valley, said the paraglider had fallen about 40ft.

He said: 'He took quite a heavy fall and suffered a serious back injury

'We put him in a full stretcher and transferred him to hospital in Wrexham.'

The Government announced last month that Britain's search and rescue helicopter service is to be run by US-based Bristow Helicopters from 2016.

The award of the Â£1.6 billion deal ends 70 years of search and rescue services run by the RAF and Royal Navy squadrons.
