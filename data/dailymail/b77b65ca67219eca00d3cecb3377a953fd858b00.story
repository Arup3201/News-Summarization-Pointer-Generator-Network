Bake Off fans should not expect too much from the show's new batch of celebrity contestants as Jennifer Saunders doesn't 'particularly like cake' and David Mitchell's top culinary gadget is a pizza cutter.

YouTube sensation Zoella, actor Michael Sheen, Strictly Come Dancing winner Abbey Clancy, presenter Alexa Chung, Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles, veteran performer Dame Edna Everage, and Gok Wan are also among the celebrities taking part in The Great Comic Relief Bake Off.

Despite the potential for some baking disasters, plain-speaking judge Paul Hollywood has promised not to mince his words on the show, which begins on BBC 1 on February 11.

'If you pussyfoot around celebrities too much they get upset,' he told Radio Times magazine. 'You have to be yourself. I think we both say it as it is, whether they like it or not. I don't really care.' 

Fellow judge Mary Berry added: 'They have no idea how much mixture goes in a tin, what they're looking for. They wing it all the way through.'

Asked how she would rate her own baking skills, Saunders told Radio Times magazine: 'I never bake. I don't think I've ever baked a cake.'

She added: 'I don't particularly like cake. If I was going to choose a thing not to eat, cake would probably be it.'

But she admitted: 'From series one, I've been a complete Bake Off addict. I absolutely love it. I couldn't care less about the cake, I just wanted to feel what it was like, to be there with Mary and Paul.'

She added: 'I like a cook, but a bake? Dear God. It's so much of a fuss, and I can't be bothered to wipe up all the flour. You make such a mess with baking, and you use so much equipment. I can't be bothered doing the washing up for just a cake.'

Meanwhile Peep Show comedian David Mitchell added: 'I think the most cheffy thing I own is a pizza cutter. That's probably not a sign of great culinary skill. I must say I think scissors are better for cutting pizza, anyway. That would be my top cookery tip!'

Fellow contestant Sarah Brown said that her husband, former prime minister Gordon Brown, has 'quite a sweet tooth'.

'If you put chocolate in it then it will go down well with him,' she said.

'I think the best cake we ever did for him was a football pitch birthday cake. We made a very nice chocolate cake, covered it all with green icing and put a Subbuteo football match on top. It was floodlit by candles.'
