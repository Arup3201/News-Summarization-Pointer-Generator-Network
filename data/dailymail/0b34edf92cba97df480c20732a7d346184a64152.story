Grandma Susan Burgess was just 59 when she died on December 5, 2012 after suffering a pulmonary embolism

A care home nurse who refused to attempt CPR or call an ambulance after a grandmother stopped breathing has been condemned by the lady's daughter.

Susan Burgess was just 59 when she died on December 5, 2012 after suffering a pulmonary embolism in her room at Holme House care home in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire.

Nurse Winifred Jozi was called when 
Mrs Burgess was found at 6.20am but an inquest heard she refused to 
attempt resuscitation and didn’t even call for an ambulance - instead, 
choosing to ring the non-emergency NHS Direct service.

Mrs Burgess, who had been staying at the care home because she was suffering from dementia, was pronounced dead an hour later.

Coroner Oliver Longstaff blasted Mrs Jozi after the inquest at Kirklees Coroner’s Court in Huddersfield was told she had been sacked and suspended from working as a nurse pending an investigation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Mrs Burgess’ daughter, Julie Marsden, 40, claims Mrs Jozi - the only nurse on duty - didn’t even check her mother’s pulse, and said she knew there was nothing she could do 'just by looking at her'.

She said: 'I’m absolutely appalled with the actions of nurse Jozi.

'She claimed that she knew my mum was dead just by looking at her, so she didn’t even check her pulse or do any of the other checks that a medical professional should do.

'I’m not a nurse and if someone looked to be in trouble I would do whatever I could to help.

'But this nurse, who claims to have 20 years of experience, just stood back and didn’t even attempt to help.

Mrs Burgess was found at 6.20am in her room at Holme House care home in Cleckheaton, West Yorks

'She just looked at my mum and said, ‘there’s nothing I can do’. She didn’t even try. She didn’t do her job.'

The inquest heard that Mrs Burgess, of nearby Dewsbury, was last seen alive in her chair at 5.45am. A doctor had ordered she was checked every half an hour due to a suspected water infection.

At 6.20pm staff summoned Mrs Jozi who refused to attempt CPR on Mrs Burgess because it was ‘not beneficial’, the court heard.

Instead she called NHS Direct who told her an operator would call back within two hours.

The inquest heard other staff were unhappy with the nurse’s decision and called 999 - when they were told by the emergency operator to try to resuscitate Mrs Burgess before an ambulance arrived.

A postmortem found she had died from blood clots in her lungs coupled with pneumonia.

The coroner accepted that it was unlikely Mrs Burgess would have survived, even if CPR had been attempted, but added: 'It seems Mrs Jozi didn’t look for a pulse. She took the proverbial ‘one look’ at her and decided she was dead.

Nurse Winifred Jozi was dismissed from her post and her actions being reported to the Nursing and Midwifery Council

'I simply don’t understand how nurse Jozi in her professional capacity could accept a callback in two hours as an appropriate response to unexpected death.'

Mother-of-two Mrs Marsden, who lives with partner Simon, 52, added: 'My mum used to work as a care assistant and she was the most loving, caring person you could ask for. I’m upset she didn’t get the same treatment herself when she needed it.

'As far as I can see, the nurse hasn’t been remorseful at all. It’s almost as if she doesn’t think she did anything wrong.

'She was a nurse who should have been able to deal with anybody who’s stopped breathing.'

A spokesperson for Croft Care, which runs Holme House, said: 'The management of the home found that the registered nurse did not follow the protocols that the home had in place

'The home reported this to Kirklees Council Safeguarding Team and the police at the time of the incident and the company carried out a full investigation into her actions culminating in her being dismissed from her post and her actions being reported to the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

'The due diligence of the other staff who did follow the protocol that was in place ensured a professional response to the poor practice of the nurse in charge.

'The company is disappointed that it was not invited to attend or comment at the inquest.

'The manager of the home worked closely with the family at the time of the incident and the company offers its deepest sympathy at the loss of their loved one.'
