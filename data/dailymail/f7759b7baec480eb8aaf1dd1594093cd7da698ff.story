Confidence in the economy is at its highest since the Coalition came to power in 2010, according to a poll. 

Nearly a third of people – some 32 per cent – said they predicted they would be ‘satisfied’ with the state of the economy by this time next year, up from 11 per cent in June. 

And 26 per cent in the YouGov poll for The Times said they were satisfied with the current state of the economy, an increase of eight per cent since the last poll.

Meanwhile the Bank of England’s new governor Mark Carney is expected to confirm that historic low interest rates are here to stay.

It is thought the Canadian will make the
unprecedented commitment on Wednesday during his first monthly inflation 
report since taking over from Lord King last month.

But it has been described as a bonus for borrowers but condemned as a 
disaster for savers. 

The new policy, dubbed ‘forward guidance’, was used by Mr Carney in his previous job as governor of the Bank of Canada.

However, it has never been used in the British central bank’s 300-year history. 

The aim of the move will be to reassure investors, businesses and households.

The Bank estimates that if rates were
to rise from the historic low of 0.5 per cent – set in March 2009 – to 
just 2.5 per cent, and incomes remained ‘subdued’, households paying 
£240billion of mortgage debt would ‘experience financial difficulties’.

David
Buik, a City commentator from broker Panmure Gordon, said: ‘The Bank 
wants to make sure that any rates movement are not a surprise to 
businesses and customers.

'It’s a very good thing for borrowers, but for savers it’s an unmitigated disaster.’

A combination of rate cuts on savings
accounts and high inflation has cost savers more than £220billion, 
according to campaign group Save Our Savers.
