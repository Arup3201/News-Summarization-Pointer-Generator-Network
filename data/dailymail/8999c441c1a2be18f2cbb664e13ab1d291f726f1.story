A mother-of-two who claimed to be a struggling single parent was exposed as a benefits cheat after posting glamorous photos from her Cyprus wedding on Facebook.

Nicola Derbyshire, 37, had told the benefits office that Adam Heard, 41, was her landlord and lived in London.

But the pair were caught out after they posted pictures of them tying the knot and releasing doves after the beach ceremony online.

The happy couple were arrested shortly after arriving back from Cyprus and charged with benefit fraud totalling more than £30,000

They were arrested shortly after arriving home to their home in Bury, Greater Manchester, and charged with defrauding the state by more than £30,000 after claiming jobseekers allowance and housing benefit between 2008 and 2012.

Fraud investigators had been monitoring both Derbyshire and Heard's Facebook pages when they noticed a flurry of wedding snaps appeared.

The wedding – which is thought to have cost thousands – took place last 
June and dozens of family and friends joined them.

Derbyshire updated her status to say she was married to Heard and wrote: 'I love my man and my gorgeous two kids more than the world itself!!'

She even posted a link to the Cypriot wedding company’s 
‘MarryInCyprus’ website.

The pair later admitted making false claims for benefits totalling £30,175 at Bury Magistrates Court and were ordered to repay the cash.

Councillor Tony Isherwood, from Bury council, said: 'We take benefit fraud very seriously. It’s not just wrong, it’s also unfair to genuine claimants who need help and are entitled to it.

'We will use all the means at our disposal to track down benefit cheats, including social media which is rapidly becoming an important source of information. If anyone suspects that people are abusing the benefits system, we would urge them to report it to the council.'

Heard was also given a 12-month community order with 100 hours unpaid work, ten sessions of community work and a 12-week curfew between 8pm and 5am.

He was ordered to pay £491.50 towards costs, at a rate of £50 per month.

Derbyshire was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for one year.

She was also ordered to do 200 hours unpaid work and ten sessions of community work, and pay costs of £569.20.
