Republicans on Capitol Hill announced Wednesday evening that just 67 per cent of Americans who bought Obamacare plans through the federal government's health insurance marketplace have sealed the deal by actually paying for their policies.

GOP members of the House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations said they went to 'all 160 insurance providers in the federally facilitated marketplace' for the data after the White House repeatedly insisted it didn't have numbers to share.

The startling results will reignite the protracted political fight over the Affordable Care Act that has dogged the Obama administration since shortly after the president took office.

Not so fast, Mr. President: Obama announced on April 17 that 8 million Americans had chosen health insurance plans through his 'federally facilitated marketplace,' but only 2/3 thirds of them appear to have paid their bills

With one-third of enrollees yet to pay premiums, Obamacare's delicate financial balance between healthy young Americans and sicker retirees is very much an unsettled question

Committee staff released state-by-state numbers for the 36 states that participated in the federal government's on-again, off-again online insurance exchange.

As of April 15, 88 per cent of new Obamacare customers in Arkansas and 87 per cent in Kansas had paid up; on the other end of the scale, only 42 per cent in Texas and 48 per cent in Oklahoma could say the same.

The other states in the survey fell somewhere in between. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia ran their own online marketplaces; The Capitol Hill Republicans didn't poll insurers in any of them.

'In a sad reversal away from its vows of transparency, the Obama administration, from inside the Oval Office on down, has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep basic details of the health law from the public,' claimed Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton, who chairs the Energy & Commerce Committee.

'Tired of receiving incomplete pictures of enrollment in the health care law, we went right to the source and found that the administration's recent declarations of success may be unfounded.'

'We need a complete picture of how this law is working,' Upton said in a statement. 'We will continue to strive for transparency and hold the administration accountable for this law’s shortcomings and broken promises.'

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fired back hours later, however, saying the Republicans' homework was incomplete.

'These claims are based on only about half of the approximately 300 issuers in the federally-facilitated marketplace,' CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said in a statement Wednesday night, 'and they do not match up with public comments from insurance companies themselves, most of which indicate that 80 to 90 percent of enrollees have paid their premium.'

'Additionally,' Albright said, 'given the significant surge in enrollments at the end of March, it stands to reason that not all enrollees would have paid by the date of this so-called report since many people’s bills were not even due yet.'

White Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Thursday that the report was a manifestation of Republicans' irritation that Obamacare was succeeding.

He would not confirm that 80 percent or more of enrollees had followed through on paying their premiums. However, he said he was 'confident it’s not going to be 67 percent.'

'We don't have hard, concrete numbers, but we dispute their numbers,' Carney said.

The White House Press Secretary refused to share even partial figures with reporters because he said he did not want to give out unreliable information.

Committee Republicans said they would revisit the totals in mid-May to see if the percentages improve.

'We don't have hard, concrete numbers, but we dispute their numbers,' White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday

House Energy & Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, released the report that indicated the White House's Obamacare enrollment numbers may be significantly inflated

It's unclear why Republicans announced totals from what they said were 'all 160 insurance providers' that issue policies through healthcare.gov while the Obama administration claimed there were 300 such companies.

The administration's number first surfaced during an October 24, 2013 congressional hearing, chaired by Upton.

Cheryl Campbell, the senior vice president of CGI Federal – the company seen as most responsible for healthcare.gov's early-day tech disasters – said then that 'more than 300 insurers, with more than 4,500 insurance plans' were participating.

Advocacy organizations across the U.S. ran a full-court press for six months in an attempt to enroll Americans, but they emphasized paying premiums far less

The administration has not, however, suggested that surveying 160 insurers would provide an inaccurate estimate for all 300.

Henry
 Waxman, a California congressman who is the Democrats' ranking member 
on the subcommittee, called Wednesday's report 'rubbish.'

House
 Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a calculating Virginia Republican, 
emphasized that his party's data 'stand in stark contrast to 
the White House's previous assertions.'

'While the 
administration was eager to declare that Obamacare's mandate had worked,
 it has so far not provided any substantive data to back that up. If 
President Obama disputes the information provided by the insurance 
companies, he should direct HHS to immediately release complete 
enrollment data, including how many people were previously insured.'

The number has become a sticking point in Washington, with most estimates painting a dim picture of the law's overall success in its quest to add tens of millions to the ranks of the insured.

McKinsey & Co. surveyed Americans and found that only 27 percent who bought new health insurance in February lacked insurance before. That number had been just 11 per cent in January.

Goldman Sachs has projected that barely 1 million of the 8 million Obamacare enrollees to date will gain insurance they didn't previously have.

A report from the RAND Corporation puts that number at 25 per cent  of the overall total.

But the interim picture includes a sobering look at how many young people signed up – and paid – for Obamacare plans during the six-month open enrollment period that ended March 31.

Just 25 per cent, according to the insurance companies, were between age 18 and age 35.

The Obama administration said in mid-April that it believed 28 percent of new policyholders were in that age group. But some industry insiders have held out hope that the number would top 40 per cent.

'In an ideal world, you’d want to get as close to that as possible,' Kaiser Family Foundation senior vice president Larry Levitt told The New York Times after Obama took his very public April 17 victory lap.

The Affordable Care Act's financial model requires a large contingent of young, healthy Americans to buy insurance, with their premiums covering the spiraling costs of treating the old and sick.
