Germany will stop Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen passport-free zone across Europe, interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich has said

Germany will stop Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen passport-free zone across Europe if they push for membership of it at an EU meeting on Thursday.

Interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich warned both nations if they insist on entry into the scheme ‘Germany will veto it and they will fail’.

The Netherlands also backs the ban. Britain is not signed up to the Schengen agreement.

It is strong language from a politician well versed in more diplomatic speak, but Germany is undergoing an invasion of immigrants from both countries with many cities experiencing extreme social tensions as a result.

Only last Friday the left-wing mayor of the former industrial city of Duisburg spoke of rubbish mountains, children of immigrants organised into gangs for stealing expeditions and an apartment block for 200 housing nearly 400 Romanians and Bulgarians.

The Schengen accord allows participating nations to allow its citizens to pass borders without having to show a passport. Twenty-six nations participate, but Britain remains outside of it out for security concerns.

When asked if either Romania or Bulgaria could have a Schengen-zone at a major air or seaport, Mr Friedrich said: ‘No,’ adding: ‘The concept of freeing up certain areas, such as arrivals by air or via seaports, is likewise unacceptable.

‘The EU has long been evaluating whether or not Romania and Bulgaria are ready for acceptance in the Schengen Area. The last annual report showed progress, but it’s not enough.

‘Bulgaria and Romania still have to be more decisive in the fight against corruption. Those who acquire a visa through bribery could travel all the way to Germany without further controls.’

The minister also called for stricter sanctions for anyone who tried to cheat a country’s social security system.

In response, Romania’s foreign  minister Titus Corlatean warned Europe’s leaders that excluding his country from the rules that allow their citizens to travel without passports would only remind Romanians of the Communist era.

He said: ‘This reminds us of a separation line we had before 1989... I am not sure Romanians were asked after World War II if they want to be on the other side of the wall with Stalin, instead of being with Churchill.’

Mr Friedrich, in a parting shot seen aimed squarely at Brussels mandarins who take decisions without consulting the people of the EU, added; ‘The Commission has to learn to pay closer attention to the viewpoints and sensitivities of the people in EU member states.

‘The basic attitude of “Oh, we’ll just turn a blind eye; the main thing is that the EU continues to grow,” is no longer acceptable for those who have to answer to the citizenry.’
