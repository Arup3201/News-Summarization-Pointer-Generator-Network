A transgender woman who believes she was unexpectedly the focus of a Planet Fitness policy controversy said that she has only used the gym’s female locker room on two occasions.

Carlotta Sklodowska came forward today after Michigan mom Yvette Cormier made headlines for having her gym membership instantly revoked when she complained about a transgender woman using the female locker room.

Sklodowska now claims that she believes she is the transgender woman Cormier saw and that she had only used the changing area on two separate visits to hang her purse and coat and to pick up her items after working out.

Speaking out: Carlotta Sklodowska says she believes that she is the transgender woman Yvette Cormier saw in the Midland, Michigan, Planet Fitness

Working out: Sklodowska said she was only at the gym on two occasions when using a friend's guest pass. She said she only used the locker room to hang her purse and coat while working out

Cormier, 48, had complained to the Planet Fitness staff in Midland last Saturday when she noticed ‘there was a man’ in the changing room.

The staff informed her that the person was transsexual and was allowed to be in the locker room, and when Cormier continued to complain, the gym canceled her membership for violating its ‘no judgement zone’ policy.

Sklodowska told MLive that she’s not a member of the gym and was there using a friend’s guest pass.

She added that she asked the gym staff about policy surrounding transgender individuals before she entered the locker room.

‘You can use the locker room that corresponds with how you are dressed,’ she said the staff member told her.

Membership revoked: Yvette Cormier was kicked out of her gym in Midland, Michigan, after complaining about a transgender woman in the female locker room

'I was stunned and shocked,' Cormier told WNEM about the incident. 'He looked like a man. He did not look like a woman.'

Cormier maintains she wasn't complaining because the person was transsexual, but because she thought there was a man in the women's room.

'This is very unprofessional,' she said. 'This is very scary.'

Sklodowska said she wore leggings and a baggy T-shirt on both gym trips. She added that she understood why Cormier would see her body structure as masculine, because many people tell her she looks like a man.

She said she uses women’s public restrooms regularly but no one has had any issues previously, and that she’s the only transgender woman she knows of in Midland, a city with a population of about 40,000.

Friends showed Sklodowska the news story about the locker room policy, and that's when she assumed the story was about her.

Kicked out: Yvette Cormier is no longer allowed to go to Planet Fitness Midland for violating their 'no judgement zone' policies

But she said she did not observe anyone in the locker room who looked distressed.

Planet Fitness have not budged on the stance they took with Cormier.

The gym says that Cormier has been talking about the incident with other people at the gym and she has been inappropriate.

'Planet Fitness is committed to creating a non-intimidating, welcoming environment for our members,' the gym said in a statement.

'Our gender identity non-discrimination policy states that members and guests may use all gym facilities based on their sincere self-reported gender identity.

'In expressing her concerns about the policy, the member in question exhibited behavior that club management deemed inappropriate and disruptive to other members, which is a violation of the membership agreement and as a result her membership was canceled.'

Planet Fitness Director of Public Relations McCall Gosselin told ABC News that Cormier handled the situation poorly.

'As our statement outlines, her membership was not cancelled as a result of complaints about our policy, as we welcome all feedback from our members,' Gosselin told ABC.

'Rather, it was the manner in which her concerns were expressed that club management felt was inappropriate, which resulted in the cancellation.'

Midland isn’t a very welcoming community for transgendered women, Sklodowska said, but she has found a supportive group of friends.

‘I have loads of friends around town,’ she told MLive. ‘They are all straight ladies. We have wonderful times together.’
