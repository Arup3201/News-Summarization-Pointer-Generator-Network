Film star and martial arts legend Jackie Chan has been asked to give advice to China's leaders during a series of important political meetings in Beijing.

The star of the Rush Hour films is one of a number of prominent Chinese people, including former NBA basketball player Yao Ming and Nobel literature prize winner Mo Yan, who will 'advise' the ruling communist party during the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

The Hong Kong actorâ€™s participation in the meeting has been criticised by some in his native city, which often chafes under rule from Beijing.

He was also blasted by democracy activists after reportedly suggesting in a Chinese magazine interview that protests in Hong Kong should be restricted. 'There should be regulations on what can and cannot be protested,' Chan told the Southern People Weekly last December.

He added: 'We (Hong Kong residents) do not like repression. We like freedom. But you cannot do whatever you want.'

The CPPCC is an advisory body, unlike the National People's Congress, or parliament, which meets today. It includes top film stars, writers, sportsmen, prominent businessmen and religious leaders.

Thousands of delegates have come to Beijing for the annual political meetings, under the watchful eye of the Segway-riding police made famous during the Beijing Olympics.

According to comments from the Xi Jinping, Communist Party chief, it seems they need all the help they can get.

The event took place against a background of uncertainty in China, with Communist Party chief Xi Jinping saying the party may not see its 100th birthday in nine years if it does not tackle China's problems

Xi formally takes over as China's new president during the annual meeting, facing a raft of challenges including growing inequality, corruption, environmental degredation, fiscal and political reform and friction with the United States and neighbouring countries.

He says the future of the party is at stake and will only be able to mark its 100th birthday in eight years time if officials can learn the lessons of the past.

In December, Xi reportedly told officials in Guangdong that China must heed the 'deeply profound' lessons of the collapse of the Soviet Union.

'Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse? An important reason was that their ideals and convictions wavered,' Mr Xi said, according to a summary of his comments that was leaked online.

Xi, who will take over the reins of state power from outgoing President Hu Jintao at this month's annual full session of parliament, has made fighting pervasive graft a central theme since assuming the top job in the party and military in November.

'Only if the capabilities of all party members unceasingly continue to strengthen, can the goal of "two 100 years" and "the dream" of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people be realised,' Xi said in a speech marking the 80th anniversary of the Central Party School, which trains rising officials.

'Two 100 years' refers to both the party and the People's Republic of China lasting at least a century each.

The People's Republic turns 100 in 2049. The Communists swept to power and founded the republic in 1949 after winning a civil war and forcing Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, or Nationalist, troops to flee to Taiwan, which Beijing still claims as its own.

The concept of 'two 100 years' has been alluded to in state media over the past few weeks, but this is the first time Xi explicitly mentioned it in his speech on Friday, which was carried in whole by the People's Daily, the party mouthpiece.

Xi has warned in the past that corruption threatens the party's very survival and launched a campaign to prevent waste and graft. He also banned the 2.3 million-strong People's Liberation Army from binge drinking and told it to be combat- ready.

Stability and survival remain the Communist Party's watchwords as the world's second-largest economy grapples with an upsurge of protests and social tensions over growing inequality, environmental degradation and graft.

One source with ties to China's leadership told Reuters: 'If the Communist Party cannot reach 100, it would only be a dot in China's 5,000-year history,' the source said.

'The Communist Party turning 100 will be Xi's most important event during his 10-year rule.'
