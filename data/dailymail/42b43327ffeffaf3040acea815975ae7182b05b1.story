Joachim Low has been lying low in recent weeks. After the triumph of Rio de Janeiro, the Germany coach retreated to his home in the Black Forest. On Tuesday, he emerged, taking the trip north to Dusseldorf for his first public appearance since the victory parade in July. He emerged with a message.

'After the World Cup Final in Rio, our goal should be, and must be, the European Championship final in Paris,' Low declared.

A statement of intent. While players such as Thomas Muller had teased the press in recent weeks, talking of how important it was not to lose motivation, Low was clear. His Germany side may have already won the biggest prize, but they are not done yet.

Wednesday night will see the side play their first game since the World Cup final, a twist of fate pitting them against the beaten finalists Argentina. 

It is already being billed as the first step on the road to Paris, and Low hopes that even the meaningless friendly can help his side 'reawaken the World Cup feeling', before they start their European Championship qualifying campaign against Scotland on Sunday.

Nonetheless, it is a very different team which Low will now attempt to lead to glory in 2016. 

In Philipp Lahm, Miroslav Klose and Per Mertesacker, Germany have lost their captain, their finest goalscorer and a hugely experienced defender to retirement since the World Cup. If the World Cup title was the crowning of a golden generation, the next two years will be the foundation years for a new era.

Low has selected Bastian Schweinsteiger as the captain to lead that new era. In many ways, the Bayern player is the obvious choice. 

As vice captain under Lahm, he was always an inspirational figure for the rest of the squad. During the World Cup, he took Kevin Grosskreutz under his wing, and his determined performance in the final is already the stuff of legend.

Schweinsteiger is, however, already 30. It is highly likely he will retire after Euro 2016. He is also infamously injury prone, having only played one friendly for Germany in the last two years. 

His current knee injury even rules him out of the Argentina game, with Manuel Neuer taking over the armband. A long term replacement for Lahm, Schweinsteiger is not.

Rather, Low has chosen him to bridge a gap. Schweinsteiger's captaincy, along with the reshuffled 'team council' of Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira and Mats Hummels, will ensure that this Germany side is still led by experienced players. 

The coach articulated this policy very openly on Tuesday, saying that Germany's famous team spirit relied on a sense of hierarchy, where experienced players lead, allowing Low himself the freedom to bring in young talents.

Some of those young talents will appear in the squad for the first time on Wednesday night. Defenders Antonio Rudiger and Sebastian Rudy have been drafted in, while other young players such as Erik Durm, Matthias Ginter and Christoph Kramer now appear to be established members of the squad, having warmed the bench at the World Cup.

This week will also see the return of Marco Reus and Mario Gomez to international football. Reus missed the World Cup through injury, while Gomez was left out of the squad by Low. 

With Klose gone, however, the latter is hugely important once more, not only as Germany's only out and out striker, but also as another injection of experience.

Gomez's selection also indicates that little about Low's tactical philosophy will change. The Fiorentina player replaces Klose, and will be used as a poacher when Low's more flexible, strikerless attacking system is being thwarted. 

Gomez is another who is unlikely to last more than two more years, and may soon be sacrificed in favour of a younger striker such as Hoffenheim's Kevin Volland.

As with every position, however, Low is embarking on a careful balancing act. His resources are almost endless; Germany have a host of established talent and a relentless supply of talented youth. Low and his new assistant manager Thomas Schneider now have the task of ensuring that the team neither becomes too stale, nor too inexperienced.

The basics will remain the same. When announcing Schneider as the successor to former assistant coach Hansi Flick, Low spoke of a man whose 'view of how football should be played is the same as mine'. That means attacking, it means goals, and it means youthful fervour. 

The new Germany will be made very much in the image of the old.
