New photographs have emerged showing the inside of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 as wreckage continues to be cleared from the Ukrainian field where 298 people lost their lives.

The plane, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down on July 17 while flying over Grabovo - a pro-Russian separatist controled village in eastern Ukraine roughly 40 miles from Donetsk.

The Dutch Safety Board, which is leading the investigation into the tragedy, has up to now had limited access to the crash site. But the board announced a few days ago that it hoped to start the recovery soon, and work to clear the site finally got under way yesterday.

A preliminary report by the DSB in September said wreckage was 'consistent with the damage that would be expected from a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside'.

'The DSB commissioned the recovery and transportation to the Netherlands of the wreckage as part of the investigation into the cause of the crash of flight MH17. As part of the investigation the DSB intends to reconstruct a section of the aircraft.'

The board went on: 'It is expected that the recovery operation will take several days, depending on the safety conditions and other factors. This will be assessed daily.

'The recovered wreckage will be collected at a location near the crash site, from where the wreckage will be transported to Kharkov (in Ukraine) and finally to the Netherlands. At this point the DSB cannot give detailed information about the means of transportation and the time schedule.'

Despite the difficulty in accessing the site due to fighting in the area, the black box flight recorders were recovered early on and were passed to the DSB after being inspected at the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) headquarters at Farnborough in Hampshire.

In its September preliminary report, the DSB said the black box information showed the MH17 flight proceeded normally until 1.20pm local time after which all recordings 'ended abruptly'.

A DSB spokeswoman said: 'The recovery of wreckage of flight MH17 has been continuing this morning. For the second day wreckage will be recovered for the investigation into the cause of the crash of flight MH17.

'The wreckage will be brought to (the Ukrainian town of) Torez, where it will be placed on trains. Later on it will be transported to Kharkov and finally to the Netherlands.

Some parts of the wreckage are so large and heavy that they required a number of workers to carry them from the crash site
