Two drivers have been arrested after a young couple died when a pair of high-powered Audis crashed into their car while allegedly racing at 90mph.

Witnesses spoke of a horrifying screech of brakes, followed by bangs after the black sports cars smashed into a Vauxhall Corsa pulling out of a side road.

The crash left Aaron Jones, 19, and his 22-year-old girlfriend Amy Hobson fatally injured.

Two drivers have been arrested after Amy Hobson, 22, and Aaron Jones, 19, died after two Audis collided with their Vauxhall Corsa in Swinton, near Manchester

Would-be rescuers said they were met by a horrific scene, with the Corsa hit so hard its engine was flung from the vehicle.

As police were preparing to question the two men on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, Mr Jones’ distraught parents said they were still half-expecting him to walk through the front door and say: ‘Aha – fooled you.’

The tragedy happened as his white Corsa pulled on to the A580 in Swinton, Greater Manchester on Sunday afternoon with mother-of-one Miss Hobson in the front passenger seat.

Witnesses 
said an Audi RS3, which is capable of doing  155mph, and a 151mph Audi 
S3 were being driven at high speeds when the drivers lost control.

They smashed into the victims’ car, with the passenger side taking the brunt of the impact.

The
 RS3 rolled several times before hitting the central reservation and 
finally a lamp post. One of the Audis is said to have burst into flames.

According to witnesses, the two Audis were travelling at speeds of up to 90mph before the collision

Mr Jones died at the scene while his girlfriend, who had a three-year-old son called Alfie, was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead a short time later.

One witness said: ‘I heard the impact, a horrifying screech of brakes then bangs and dust flying up.

Aaron Tulsa Jones, 19, and girlfriend Amy Louise Hobson, 22, were driving along the A580 East Lancs road in Salford, Manchester when two Audis ploughed into them

Both Audis were damaged but one caught fire. People were running out of a nearby golf club to help. We believe one clipped the other before the crash. It was just a horrible sight.’

Motorist Lynne Scanlan said: ‘We saw a lady being given CPR on the road and there looked to be cars just strewn everywhere.’

Yesterday, Mr Jones’s father Rob, 49, said: ‘He had a heart of gold. He had lots of friends. Everybody he met just took to him.

‘I just can’t believe he’s gone. I keep expecting him to walk through the door.’

The couple had been together for about a year after meeting while working at McDonald’s in Pendlebury. 

Mr Jones’s father said the family were desperate to contact Miss Hobson’s so they could support each other and return some of her precious belongings.

Their son was also a black-belt in karate. He and Miss Hobson were instructors at a local club.

Clare Lord, operations manager north for McDonald’s UK, said: ‘Aaron and Amy were popular, valued friends and colleagues and will be dearly missed.’

On Twitter, Jack Hinds posted: ‘R.I.P Amy Hobson & Aaron Jones. Racing cars on public roads is totally wrong.’

Police have appealed for witnesses.  The suspects are aged 27 and 25. One suffered a back injury in the crash. He was in hospital last night as detectives wait until he is well enough to be questioned.

The other was  in  custody.

Films in the Fast and Furious series have been blamed for glamorising street racing. Police forces around the country have placed exclusion orders on popular gathering sites for racers.

The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years in prison.
