Several inspiring actors have sent raunchy photos of themselves to a scammer who tricked them into believing they were applying for roles as 'busty wenches' on Pirates of the Caribbean Five. 

The women had responded to a legitimate casting call from Bud Hopes Casting on the Gold Coast calling for busty females to work as extras on the Hollywood blockbuster.

But some were then targeted by a scammer who created an almost identical email address to trick the women into sending revealing images of their breasts.

Several inspiring actors have sent raunchy photos of themselves to a scammer who tricked them into believing they were applying to a Gold Coast casting agency to appear in Pirates of the Caribbean

The scammer asked the women to send photos and videos directly to the email address telling them to show off their assets and there was 'no such thing as showing too much'.

The email address was the same as the casting agency's legitimate contact, but was missing just one letter - an 's'.

Shiloh Maree, a Brisbane-based actor, told Seven News she jumped at the opportunity to work on the fifth instalment of Pirates of the Caribbean starring Johnny Depp. 

The 22-year-old sent a video flaunting her cleavage before realising the 'agent' was fake.

'It's not a good feeling, I've been taken advantage of,' she said.

'It's sickening how someone out there is doing this.'

Casting agent Bud Hopes took to his company's Facebook page to confirm casting had finished and shed light on the fake email address.

'We would like to flag that the following email budhopecasting@gmail.com is in no way affiliated with Bud Hopes Casting,' he wrote. 

'Any correspondence with this email address is in no way connected with Bud Hopes Casting or the castings we have listed.' 

The original casting call from Bud Hopes asked for busty, Caucasian women with a D-FF bra size.
