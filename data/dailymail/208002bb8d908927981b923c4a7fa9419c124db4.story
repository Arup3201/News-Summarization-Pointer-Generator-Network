Thirty years on from his own first world-title defence, Barry McGuigan is calling on Carl Frampton to follow his lead and deliver a knockout in his first fight as a world champion.

The Belfast ‘Jackal’ defends his IBF super-bantamweight world crown on Saturday night, returning to the Odyssey Arena five months after defeating Kiko Martinez at a purpose-built stadium on the Titanic slipways.

While there is a more limited capacity attendance at the ‘Jackal’s Den’, a heated atmosphere is expected after a tension-filled pre-fight press conference yesterday, while additional pressure is on Framton’s shoulders as the fight marks the return of world-championship boxing to terrestrial television on ITV/UTV Ireland.

When asked to compare the first defence of his world featherweight title, against American Bernard Taylor 30 years ago, to the challenge facing Frampton, the ‘Clones Cyclone’ pointed to similarities in expectation, but differences in styles.

McGuigan stopped the then-undefeated Taylor in eight rounds, three months after his famous title win over Eusebio Pedroza at Loftus Road, and he believes Frampton can also record a knockout in his first defence.

‘You’re definitely buoyed by that [winning the title],’ said McGuigan. ‘Carl’s going to be fired up because he knows this guy is going to be a tough fight for him. He enjoys guys who come and fight with them.

‘It’s interesting. My first defence was a situation where I had to put pressure on a guy. He’s in a situation where he’s probably more dangerous and he’s going to come to him. Carl needs to respect his power, be switched on from bell to bell every single round and just perform well.’

McGuigan, who turns 54 on Saturday, is hoping for the ideal birthday present from his undefeated protégé, but emphasised that a shot at superstardom is on the line for Frampton as he takes on the 25-year-old Chris Avalos.

The Californian has suffered two losses on points in a 27-fight career and has recorded as many knockouts as 28-year-old Frampton has had fights.

‘Carl’s a bright kid, a smart kid, he knows what’s on the line here,’ said McGuigan. ‘He knows the risks, he knows the potential of a unification fight. He knows that doesn’t happen unless he performs really well on Saturday night.’

A colourful back-and-forth at Thursday’s press conference saw Avalos and his manager, Mike Criscio, challenge Frampton to wager some of his purse on the fight result, with the invitation following reports that they have already bet around £10,000 with Belfast bookies on victory for the Californian.

‘I wouldn’t like to take your money off you,’ Frampton told Avalos. ‘You’ve had the same tracksuit top on your for about four days. Every time I’ve seen you, you’ve been wearing that coat so I wouldn’t like to take your money off you.’
