It could have been worse - she could have said a really bad speech.

The winner of the Miss Universe 2013 pageant had her special crowning moment disrupted after the all-important tiara came tumbling off her head!

Gabriela Isler from Venezuela managed to catch the crown as it happened and laughed off the moment.

She was presented with the tiara by Miss Universe 2012, the United States' Olivia Culp, who watched on in shock as the faux pas happened.

The 25-year-old is a Venezualen TV personality and accomplished flamenco dancer.

This year's pageant was held at a sprawling exhibition hall on the outskirts of Moscow.

Patricia Rodrigues of Spain was the runner-up.

Isler bested 86 contestants to take the crown.

'I have a lot of emotions,' she said.

'I can’t describe all the things that I feel at this moment because I’m shaking.'

The panel of judges was led by American rock musician Steven Tyler, who also performed.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro congratulated Isler on Twitter, calling her title a 'triumph' for Venezuela, a country that has now won three of the last six Miss Universe pageants.

Held in Moscow, the competition had a uniquely Russian theme

In fact, Venezuela has won more major international beauty competitions than any other nation, and beauty pageants rank alongside baseball as the country's most-followed diversion, one that transcends social class and normally insurmountable political divisions.

A whole industry of grooming schools, plastic surgeons and beauty salons has emerged to prepare young women for the thousands of pageants that take place each year around the country in schools, army barracks and even prisons.

Venezuela has managed to keep its beauty queen industry flourishing, despite economic problems have worsened in recent weeks as inflation touched a two-decade high of 54 percent and shortages of basic goods like toiled paper and milk have worsened.

Driving the crisis has been a collapse in the currency, which has plunged to a tenth of its official value in illegal black market trading.

To arrest the fall, Maduro last week ordered the military to inspect prices and shut down businesses found to be charging abusive prices.

A day after the government seized control of a nationwide chain of appliance stores, doors reopened Saturday to throngs of shoppers seeking to buy TVs, washing machines and refrigerators at a fraction of their listed price.
