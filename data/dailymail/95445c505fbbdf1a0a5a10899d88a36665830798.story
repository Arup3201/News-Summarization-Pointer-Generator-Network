West Brom striker Saido Berahino has been disqualified from driving for a year and fined £3,400 after admitting a drink-driving charge at Runcorn Magistrates' Court on Friday morning.

Berahino had been due to appear in court on Monday but the case was brought forward so that the striker could play against Everton later that night.

Berahino was arrested in the early hours one morning in October, just a couple of weeks before he was named in the England squad for the first time.

The incident has not affected the forward, however. He has scored six goals in the last three games and 14 for the season.

When he struck a hat-trick against Gateshead in the FA Cup, he controversially refused to celebrate in protest at being labelled a 'bad boy'.

West Brom shelved contract talks with Berahino until the case had been heard and could now resume discussions over a long-term deal.
