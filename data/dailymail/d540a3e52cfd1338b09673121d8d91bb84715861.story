More than 900 police officers  continue to serve despite being convicted of crimes including violence, robbery and fraud.

Forces employ policemen and women 
with criminal records for assault, burglary, supplying drugs and 
perverting the course of justice.

Among them are several senior 
officers, including two detective chief inspectors and a chief inspector
working for the Metropolitan Police.

Pounding the beat: More than 900 serving police officers and community support officers have a criminal record

A police officer found guilty of gross misconduct after sending racist and sexist texts is still in his job, Northamptonshire Police has confirmed.

The behaviour of the constable was revealed in a Freedom of Information request submitted to the force by a member of the public, which said the officer had been disciplined earlier this year over text messages sent to another officer while off duty.

Although the force insisted it did not tolerate sexism or racism, follow-up questions by the Chron have revealed the officer is still working in the county.

A Northamptonshire police spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that this year an officer was found guilty of racially and sexually-related misconduct, which involved the sending of inappropriate texts.

'It was found that these breached the high standards Northamptonshire Police demands of its officers. Sexist and racist behaviour will not be tolerated on or off duty.

'The officer in question accepted that the texts were wrong. The panel determined that the matter had not affected the officer's service to the community and as such the individual concerned has been allowed to continue to serve for the force.'

For such misconduct, an officer could potentially lose their job, but it is only one of a number of sanctions that can be brought, depending on the severity of the case. In each case, previous good conduct and character is taken into consideration.

Anjona Roy, chief executive of Northamptonshire Rights and Equality Council, said knowing a still-serving officer had sent racist and sexist texts could damage public confidence in the force.

She said: 'Policing is dependent on people's confidence in officers. They are in a position of power and people have to feel that it won't be used for unfair purposes.

'I'd like to see all police standards reports made available where the officer has been found guilty so the public can judge for themselves if they think the punishment is proportionate or not.'

In some cases continuing to employ 
officers appears to directly contradict Government guidelines which 
insist on ‘proven integrity’.

They highlight that people with 
convictions for certain offences, including assault, dangerous driving 
and burglary, should not be recruited.

At least 944 serving officers and police community support officers 
(PCSOs) have a conviction. Most are for traffic offences such as 
speeding and drink-driving, but there are also offences of dishonesty 
and fraud.

Among the 944 are a Devon and Cornwall PC convicted of burglary as a 
teenager and officers in Essex convicted of dangerous driving, supplying
cannabis and robbery.

A volunteer special constable continues to serve despite being convicted
of swiping a set of car number plates and using them to steal petrol 
from service stations.

In Hertfordshire a sergeant was convicted of dangerous driving and a 
Kent PC has a 1998 conviction for perverting the course of justice.
Five Merseyside officers have been convicted of assault and another has a
criminal record for causing death by careless driving.

A North Wales 
officer was convicted of forgery and a Staffordshire Police inspector 
has a record for keeping a dangerous dog.

A Surrey Police detective constable was convicted of obstructing police 
while others have records for wounding, drink driving and animal 
cruelty.

The total figure was revealed by 32 of the 43 forces in England and 
Wales in response to requests under freedom of information laws.

Many could not provide details of criminal records dating from before 
their staff joined, meaning the true figure is likely to be higher.

The Metropolitan Police, Britain’s 
largest force, employed the most staff with convictions, 356 officers 
and 41 PCSOs. It was followed by Kent (49), Devon and Cornwall (44), 
Essex (42), South Yorkshire (35), Hampshire (31) and West Midlands (27).

There are around 140,000 police officers, 15,000 PCSOs and 70,000 civilian staff  in the 43 forces.

The figures emerged as a senior 
police officer insisted officers who resign before facing misconduct 
procedures are not being ‘let off the hook’.

Commander Peter Spindler, of the Met,
admitted more than 130 employees left Scotland Yard over the past year 
instead of facing disciplinary measures.

But he said in many cases it is more 
‘pragmatic’ to let them resign, and said complaints against police are 
falling. Simon Reed, vice president of the Police Federation, said 
misconduct panels decide whether an officer should be dismissed after 
considering each case.

He said: ‘Most police officers are 
dismissed if they commit a crime. It may be easy to condemn some cases 
but there will be specific reasons these people have been kept on.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the number of officers with criminal convictions is a small proportion of the workforce.

He added: ‘Any instance where the conduct of our staff is alleged to have fallen below the standards of behaviour expected is treated extremely seriously by the Met.’A Home Office spokesman said forces should reject potential recruits with convictions for serious offences unless there are ‘exceptionally compelling circumstances’.

Hundreds of police officers facing misconduct allegations are being allowed to escape punishment by quitting their forces.

More than 130 employees were 
permitted by chief officers to walk out of Scotland Yard over the past 
year instead of facing a misconduct panel.

The force sacked 43 officers over that same period, figures show.

With
police conduct under 'unprecedented' scrutiny, Commander Peter 
Spindler, the Metropolitan Police's discipline chief, insisted he was 
not letting corrupt officers off the hook.

But Mr Spindler, head of the force's 
directorate of professional standards, said in many cases 'it's actually
more pragmatic to let them resign'.

Officers
have been angered by a recent report by the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission (IPCC) claiming forces were failing to respond to 
'far too many' complaints about officers.

Detective
Chief Superintendent Richard Heselden said he had been told 'we should 
be making an example of them' instead of letting them resign.

But
he said: 'The process is slow, they are sitting there on taxpayers' 
expense, secondly there's no guarantee that a panel will come to that 
conclusion.

'It's cheaper and quicker to get them out of the force. The objective is to get someone out (of) the organisation.'

Officers
working at the internal discipline unit said they would welcome clarity
offered by recommendations in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, the 
public investigation launched in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.

Mr Heselden said there were 'grey areas' surrounding relations between police and journalists.

He said: 'For me, if I leak to a criminal, I'm a criminal. No-one doubts it.

'If I make an inappropriate leak to my family and tell them about sensitive police matters, that's a crime.

'But
if I do it to a journalist ... is that a crime? Or is it public 
interest? At what point does public interest disclosure meet 
corruption?'

Discipline officers have beefed up 
the internal investigation unit in recent months, moving into a 
centralised base in Earls Court.

Officers say they now have 'every power available' to beat corruption, including setting up stings on its own employees.

In one recent case, the team set up a fake raid in a bid to snare an officer suspected of stealing from crime scenes.

'You wouldn't believe the work we go to,' Mr Heselden said.

'It
had been set up to look like an east European drug dealer, including 
even the food in the fridge. People who are corrupt are incredibly 
suspicious.

'They know we exist and what lengths we go to - it means we have to go to the utmost lengths to outmanoeuvre them.'
