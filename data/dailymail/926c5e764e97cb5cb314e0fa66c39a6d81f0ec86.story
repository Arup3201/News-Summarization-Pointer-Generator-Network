Rarely can a more extreme hospital pass have been thrown in professional rugby union’s brief history than the one sent flying at Dai Young when he took over at Wasps three years ago.

Promised the world by former owner Steve Hayes - or a new stadium and training facility at the very least -it soon dawned on Young that he had inherited rugby’s equivalent of a cut-and-shut job.

Patched up, repaired but only just functioning, it took Young less than two months to realise the vision he’d been sold was in fact a nightmare as Wycombe Council unexpectedly refused planning permission for a new stadium and Wasps’ financial taps were turned off.

Dai Young has had to deal with the move to Coventry

Within weeks, players were no longer being paid. Young himself went for three months without pay and even resorted to buying the team’s first aid tape on match-days while contributing to the cost of travel. Lesser men would have walked away. Young stood firm.

‘It was a low time,’ the 47-year-old former Wales and British Lions prop told Sportsmail this week. ‘The players knew things weren’t right but they probably didn’t know just how bad things were. When you don’t get paid for three months yourself and you’re paying for match-day tape and coach and bus journeys out of your own pocket - as well as being in a relegation fight -it’s not that easy to convince the players the club will come through it and find an owner.

‘It was hard to stick with the line that Wasps was too big to go out of business. You know all this is going on in the background but to a certain extent I had to try to mask it from the players a little.

‘I believed the club would come out of it although there were dark days towards the end when I was starting to think “this has gone on too long”. It was probably the first time in my rugby career when I felt out of control.

‘When I signed I didn’t realise the club were in such a bad state. But I’d like to put on record that I have absolutely no issues with Steve Hayes. I don’t for one minute think I was deceived.

‘But when the financial taps get turned off it’s hard. I never, ever thought about quitting but it didn’t take me long to realise I’d take on a bit of a suicide mission.’

To coincide with Wasps financial meltdown in 2011, the former Cardiff Blues boss also had to contend with a raft of injury- enforced retirements that saw Dan Ward-Smith, Steve Thompson, Joe Worsley and club captain Tom Rees unexpectedly call time on their careers.

Lock Simon Shaw moved to Toulon while Riki Flutey also missed much of the season with injury.

Miraculously, Young kept the club in the Aviva Premiership and over the past three seasons has nurtured an array of young talent which will surely develop into one of the country’s strongest squads with the extra investment set to flood in following the long-overdue arrival of new owner Derek Richardson.

Perhaps even more miraculously, Young never lost the dressing room.

‘People thought it was a bit of a throwaway statement for me when I said my biggest coaching achievement was keeping Wasps in the Premiership in my first season,’ said Young. ‘But we were on the point of bankruptcy and we had so many retirements.’

The announcement the club are set to move to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry following a protracted, multi-million pound purchse is still only 12 days old. But already there is a sense that even the diehard fans are beginning to accept the financial reality the club found themselves in at sharing Adams Park with Wycombe.

‘I understand the anger and frustration but we have a loyal bunch of supporters,’ said Young. ‘Once we’d explained, they were intelligent enough to accept they would rather Wasps existed in 20 years. I saw a quote “move or die” and that hit the nail on the head.’

Today, Young’s club are alive and kicking. The two-time champions travel to Dublin to face Leinster in their opening Pool 2 clash with a spring in their step following last week’s impressive Premiership win over Bath.
