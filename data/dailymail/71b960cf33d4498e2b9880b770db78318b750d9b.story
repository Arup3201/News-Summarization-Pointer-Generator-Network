The worst thing most people will get caught carrying at security is a bottle of water, but there are some passengers who attempt to sneak some dangerous and very bizarre items onto planes.

The TSA (Transport Security Administration) has its own Instagram feed documenting the unusual items it confiscates from airport security checkpoints - and it certainly makes for interesting viewing. 

From passengers travelling with their beloved eels, to hiding knives in the most unlikely of places, the TSA shares it all with its 238,000 followers. 

Though potentially harmless, this toy must be checked by explosive detection professionals, the TSA says

Discovered in a carry-on bag at the Eagle County Regional Airport in Colorado, it's hard to know what this odd-looking creature is.

While it might be nothing more than a homourous novelty toy, TSA agents have no way of knowing if the grenade in its hand is actually inert until explosive detection professionals have the chance to examine the item.

Grenades, whether inactive or otherwise, are prohibited in any carry-on or checked luggage. 

Another item to leave out of your hand luggage? Seal bombs, like those discovered in a passenger's carry-on bag in Seattle's Tacoma International Airport.

A seal bomb is a small explosive used to frighten seals from fishing areas, but, unfortunately, what this traveller didn't know is that all explosives are prohibited from both carry-on and checked baggage.

One of the oddest items that MailOnline came across while browsing the TSA Instagram was definitely a medieval mace, which was discovered in a carry-on bag at Chicago's Midway International Airport.

Similarly dangerous, a pair of cat-shaped brass knuckles were seized at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.

While they may look like a key chain at first glance, these feline-inspired weapons can cause serious harm and are banned from bringing on board.

In 2012, officers seized a bag of live eels, which they found in a passenger's checked luggage in Miami

Officers received a massive shock when they discovered a bag full of live eels back in 2012.

Found in a passenger's checked bag at the Miami International Airport, the traveller was attempting to transport 163 marine tropical fish and 22 invertebrates to Maracaibo, Venezuela.

However, instead of arguing with security, the passenger, smartly, opted to surrender all items to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 

Seven small snakes were also discovered in Miami in 2011, after being stuffed down a traveller's trousers in nylon stockings.

The snakes were found using TSA's Advanced Imaging Technology, which allows officers to find threatening items that have been concealed from plain sight.

The passenger was later arrested and charged.  

And yet another animal-based smuggling attempt was made in the form of a knife concealed within a Scooby Doo greeting card, despite the fact that all knives are prohibited from carry-on bags.

Also in Miami in 2011, a passenger attempted to smuggle seven snakes, in nylon stockings, in their trousers

Swords, though fine to check, cannot be brought on board an airplane as a carry-on item

This Jack the Ripper-like sickle was seized from a passenger's bag because no blades are allowed on board

Throwing stars, which are used in martial arts, are banned in some American states but not others

Interestingly, one item travellers can bring through security: a freshly-baked pie, like this one

From swords and a Jack the Ripper-like sickle to throwing stars, all bladed objects are prohibited from carry-on bags - but that hasn't kept many passengers from attempting to transport them through the security checkpoint. 

But don't worry, even swords can be taken to your destination in a checked suitcase. 

Interestingly, however, you are allowed to bring baked goods through security, such as this pecan pie.
