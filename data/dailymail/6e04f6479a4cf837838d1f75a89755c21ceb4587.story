Patients have a ‘human right’ to be told if they have dementia, the new head of the NHS has declared.

GPs should always seek to diagnose the illness and not make the assumption that sufferers would rather stay in the dark, said Simon Stevens.

He warned that there was an ‘attitude of fatalism’ about dementia in the NHS – and society – with both patients and doctors thinking ‘nothing could be done’.

Human right: NHS chief executive Simon Stevens (pictured) said dementia patients must be diagnosed

Mr Stevens is now issuing new guidelines for family doctors which set out the importance of diagnosing dementia, which is characterised by failing brain functions such as memory loss.

Figures suggest that 850,000 Britons have the syndrome but half have never been formally diagnosed.

And in some GP surgeries only 13 per cent of patients with the condition have been given a diagnosis – fewer than one in seven.

The low figure is partly because patients and their relatives are reluctant to tell doctors about dementia symptoms because they assume it is just old age – or pointless because there is no cure.

Some GPs are also unwilling to send elderly patients for scans as they want to protect them from the news that they have an illness for which there is no treatment.

But Mr Stevens said that once patients were diagnosed they could be offered medication to help stave off symptoms as well as crucial support and advice.

Addressing a conference of the Alzheimer’s Society in London, he said: ‘Let’s face, it there has been an attitude of fatalism about dementia which says, “there’s nothing much that can be done and therefore I’d rather not know because when I do, no good can be done”. That is the wrong way of thinking.

‘Medication does help many people become more themselves for a useful period of time.

‘There’s an opportunity for individuals and families to maximise joyful activities, plan and mitigate against potential difficulties and crises. It’s increasingly important that we diagnose and code patients with early dementia so that their risk of deteriorating may be understood when they go into hospital.

New guidelines: Mr Stevens was named the new chief executive of NHS England earlier this year

‘Most importantly of all, it seems to be a basic human right for patients to know about their own medical condition.’ Mr Stevens, who took up the post in April, added: ‘We’re moving away from the concept of protecting patients from the diagnosis because nothing can be done and towards offering timely diagnosis for patients.

‘We should respect the decision of patients and their families to present themselves at a time that is right for them. But that should not excuse inaction on the part of the National Health Service.’

The Government says that by next year, two thirds of dementia patients will have been given a formal diagnosis.

Yet Professor Alistair Burns, the NHS’s national clinical director for dementia, told the conference there were some surgeries in England where the rate was just 13 per cent. He said he would be visiting these practices to find out why they are failing to diagnose so many patients. One GP based in West Lincolnshire said she was reluctant to tell patients they had dementia because there was so little support and treatment on offer.

The doctor – who did not give her name – said: ‘I’m not against diagnosing early, it’s just what do I do afterwards.’

There is no cure for dementia, although there are a handful of drugs available on the NHS which can temporarily slow its progression by a few months.

Last year the NHS gave GPs new incentive payments for increasing diagnosis rates. All suspected dementia patients must be referred to memory clinics.

The NHS now compiles diagnosis data for every surgery and compares the figure to the number that would be expected given the surgery’s population.
