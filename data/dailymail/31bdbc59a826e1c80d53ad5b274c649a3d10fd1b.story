A war hero who survived Dunkirk has been condemned to life in a wheelchair by a string of NHS blunders, he claimed today.

Douglas Mainwaring, 92, of Bridgend, South Wales, visited his GP with a sore foot but alleges his botched treatment left him needing his left leg amputated.

And while he was in hospital recovering from the amputation he caught MRSA - which has left him facing the prospect of losing his right foot as well.

Now Mr Mainwaring, who used to be so fit he walked five miles every day, has been left devastated by his disability.

He said: 'I went through a lot during the war - but what I am going through now is far worse.  'This has absolutely ruined my life.'

Mr Mainwaring, who served in the Royal Army Service Corp in Europe and Africa during the Second World War, added: 'I used to be out in my garden, growing vegetables. Now I can't stand up.

'My right foot is black and I can't put any weight on it. These doctors have ruined my life.'

His family have now contacted a solicitor and are making a legal claim against the NHS. The GP who treated the father-of-five Douglas worked for the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board which is currently at the centre of a probe into high death rates and poor care for patients.

Retired long distance lorry driver Douglas's ordeal started when he visited his GP, suffering from a painful foot.

The doctor said it was likely to have been caused by a verruca and tried to treat it with a freezing spray.

But the spray is believed to have caused an infection that spread from his foot to the leg - which became so gangrenous it had to be amputated.

Daughter Yvonne said: 'The GP sprayed quite a large area of dad's foot. Less than a month later we noticed his foot turning black.

'We took him to hospital and the first thing the surgeon asked was: "When did you have frostbite?"

'After that things just got worse and worse. He was in terrible pain.'

Douglas, who has been married to wife Jean, 81, for 63 years, suffered repeated problems with his leg.

Finally, in October 2012, medics made the heart-breaking decision to amputate his leg.  But when he was in Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, recovering from the amputation a chiropodist cut his remaining foot while clipping his toe nails.

The family say he developed MRSA in the wound and NHS staff failed to notice.  The infection has now spread to most of the foot, turning his toes black.

In a few weeks the retired long distance lorry driver will find out if the foot can be saved.

Yvonne added: 'Before this disaster Dad was the fittest man you could find for his age. Now he is in pain and has to have everything done for him.'

Two hospitals run by ABMU, including Princes of Wales Hospital where Douglas was treated, are at the centre of a probe into high death rates and poor care for patients.

A spokesman for ABMU said: 'We can confirm the GP surgery received a complaint and met with the patient.

'The surgery's understanding is the issues raised were resolved. The health board has not received any formal complaint. At this stage it's not appropriate to comment further.'
