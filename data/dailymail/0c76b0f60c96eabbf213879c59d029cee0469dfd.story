The attorney for two woman who have already pleaded not guilty to the murder of a 23-year-old woman says it was the victim who threw the first punch.

Candace Brito, 27, and Vanesa Zavala, 25, are each accused of killing Annie Hung 'Kim' Pham outside a Santa Ana nightclub on January 18.

Their attorneys say that a new witness statement reveals that Pham's friends were part of a gang and that Brito and Zavala were acting in self-defense.

Held: Vanesa Zavala appears in a Westminster courtroom with her attorney, Ken Reed, for a arraignment hearing Friday, February 21

'There have been some developments in the case that directly implicate the Asians standing in line in terms of gang affiliation,' Michael  Molfetta, attorney for Brito told the OC Register.

'They were the aggressors, the instigators.'

He says the prosecution knew about the witness but kept it from the defense.

The witness, Alfonso Magana, told Santa Ana detectives that Pham beat up his girlfriend the night of the fight.

When Magana tried to help his girlfriend, men from Pham's group jumped in and chased him, shouting the name of a gang.

'It explains what occurred and why it occurred and it puts to rest this ridiculous assertion that a lack of cooperation from the Asian community in this case was somehow a cultural thing,' Molfetta said, reports the OC Register.

'Now we know why. Gang members do not cooperate with law enforcement.'

Killed over a photo? Kim Pham was knocked to the
 ground and beaten by a group of men and women after a friend 
said she may have accidentally ruined their picture by walking in front 
of the camera

Plea: Posters put near the crime scene appealing for information about the tragic January incident

Attorneys for the prosecution say there is no evidence that the fight was gang related and that new revelations make no difference to the case.

'It doesn't matter who was the initial aggressor,' Pino said, reported City News Service.

'The bottom line is she's on the ground defenseless as these two defendants kick her in the head. And that's what killed her.'

A witness to the fatal beating of a 
girl attacked for an ‘accidental photobomb’ described to a 911 
dispatcher how ‘there were guys and girls hitting her’.

Police
 released a recording of a frantic phone call made to the emergency 
services in the immediate aftermath of an attack that killed Annie Hung 
Kim Pham, 23, outside The Crosby Club in Los Angeles.

After
 being connected, the witness said: ‘There’s a fight right here off 
Broadway and 4th Street. There’s a girl that’s unconscious.’

The dispatcher asked how the girl came to be unconscious and if anybody had any weapons.

The female witness said: ‘No, there were guys and girls hitting her.’

After
 the dispatcher reassured her that paramedics would be dispatched 
immediately, the witness said that Ms Pham suddenly started breathing.

She said: ‘She’s breathing now. She just took a deep breath.’

The
 dispatcher is told that the people that beat Ms Pham up had run off and
 appeared to be ‘Asian men and women probably around 23 or 24 years 
old’.

She added: ‘One of the
 security guards picked her up and she p***** herself. I don’t know if 
that matters. She’s still breathing.’

The call lasted almost six minutes, with a police officer arriving on the scene within five minutes.

Cellphone video where the victim could be seen being kicked in the head.

The jumpy recording depicts Ms Pham wrestling with another woman on a sidewalk.

As they struggle, a woman in a white blouse, black jacket and boots approaches and appears to kick Pham in the head.

Disturbing: Police were quick to announce that they did not believe the attack was motivated by race, as the area has a large Vietnamese community that were concerned about a possible hate crime

attack was shared on Facebook. It shows people trying to break up a
