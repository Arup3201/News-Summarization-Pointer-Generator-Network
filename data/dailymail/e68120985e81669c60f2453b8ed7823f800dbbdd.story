Creaking floorboards, taps at the window and bumps in the night. 

At this time of year, it's less about home comforts and more about unwanted visitors of the supernatural variety.

These are some of the world's most haunted hotels, and for the brave there's still time to book themselves in for a ghoulish Halloween night.

Haunted: The Langham Hotel in Westminster is said to have been visited by the ghost of a German prince 

The Langham Hotel, London

London's elegant Langham Hotel opened in 1865 and has accommodated royalty and literary greats including Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde.

The grand Victorian hotel - home to the original afternoon tea - prides itself on 'service with poise', but some say it is frequented by a host of spectres.

It is claimed several ghosts have been seen stalking the corridors and bedrooms - including a German doctor who reportedly murdered his wife before committing suicide while on honeymoon at the hotel, and a soldier who committed suicide by throwing himself off a balcony.

The hotel's website says: 'In 1973 a BBC radio announcer James Alexander-Gordon awoke suddenly in the night to see a fluorescent ball which slowly took on the shape of a man wearing Victorian evening wear.'

Luxury - and allegedly haunted - liner, The Queen Mary, is now permanently docked in Long Beach, California

The stately Queen Mary was once the largest passenger ship in the world.

Now a permanently docked hotel on Long Beach, California, since being retired in 1967, the vessel has been renovated to restore its authentic 1930s Art Deco style.

The ghosts of two passengers who drowned are said to haunt the first class swimming pool, and a man in a 1930s suit has been spotted in the first class suites.

During World War II,  300 of the ship's men drowned, and it is said that they can sometimes be heard pounding on the exterior walls, crying out for help. Cabin B340 has had so many disturbances that it's no longer rented.

Ghost town hotel: The Jerome Grand Hotel in Arizona is said to be home to some very noisy spirits

Jerome Grand Hotel, Arizona 

Jerome is Arizona's largest ghost town - in all senses of the word. 

By the 1950s the town's population had dwindled to just 100 and its reputation for haunted houses had become renowned in the area and across America.

The Jerome Grand Hotel was built in 1926 as the United Verde Hospital. After it closed in 1950, the building remained unused for the next 44 years.

The hotel website claims the area is one of the ten most haunted places in the whole of America. 

Some guests at the hotel have complained of laboured breathing and coughing noises coming from the corners of their rooms, others say they have felt physically touched by spirits while they slept - or at least tried to.

Even supernatural guests enjoy the luxury offered at The Banff Springs Hotel in Alberta, Canada

The Banff Springs Hotel, Alberta, Canada  

Canada's 'Castle in the Rockies' in the heart of Banff National Park, a Unesco World Heritage Site, has been providing luxurious hospitality to our guests for more than 125 years.

The Fairmont Banff Springs is a year-round mountain resort with a golf course during the summer,  skiing in the winter and a year-round spa.

But according to legend, many years ago a bride accidentally touched her dress to a candle on a flight of stairs. 

Her dress went up in flames and she fell down the stairs to her death. Guests report seeing her frequently roaming the halls of the hotel.

The Stanley Hotel, in Estes Park, Colorado, was the inspiration for Stephen King's novel The Shining

As well as hosting a variety of rich and famous guests, including RMS Titanic survivor Margaret Brown and Theodore Roosevelt, since its opening in 1909, The Stanley Hotel was the inspiration for Stephen King's The Shining. 

Within sight of the Rocky Mountain National Park, the Stanley offers panoramic views of the Rocky Mountains and its surrounding lands are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  

Ghosts of children have been spotted here, and their impressions left behind in mattresses. King himself reported that he saw a ghost of a small child on the second floor.

Every year The Stanley celebrates the presence of the hotel's supernatural guests with its annual Shining Ball, a Halloween masquerade party, murder mystery dinners and a ghost adventure package, which includes a room on the haunted fourth floor.

A bit too cosy: The lobby at the Timberline Lodge in Mount Hood National Forest, Oregon

The Timberline Lodge, Oregon

When director Stanley Kubrick was looking for the perfect stand-in for the fictional Overlook Hotel for the film version of The Shining, this unique 1930s ski lodge on top of Oregon's Mount Hood is what he chose for exteriors.

The interiors of the 1980 horror movie were shot in London's Elstree Studios.

Large parties can book the lodge's isolated Silcox Hut, Oregon's highest hotel room (it's above the main lodge at 7,000ft, right next to the ski lifts) and it's the biggest bunkhouse you're likely to ever see, sleeping 24 guests. Just watch out for supernatural visitors in the night.
