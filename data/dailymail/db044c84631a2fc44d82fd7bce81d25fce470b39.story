Trials of safe standing at football grounds moved a step closer after a survey of fans across the country revealed that 96 per cent backed its return.

The campaign to see standing in the terraces introduced back into English football has been gathering pace.

Last year, Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward pledged to support the principle of having safe standing at Old Trafford, as revealed by Sportsmail.

That followed a number of Premier League clubs, including Aston Villa, Hull and Swansea, indicating their support for the idea.

Now a survey of 2,364 fans from around the country, conducted by the Welsh Conservatives and the Football Supporters Federation, has confirmed that the majority would like to see it trialled in stadiums.

The survey also suggested that 84 per cent believe it would decrease problems between stewards and fans and 97 per cent feel that modern technology can make standing safe at grounds.

Director of Communications for the Football Supporters Federation Michael Brunskill said: ‘Many fans love to stand at games, it can vastly improve the atmosphere and camaraderie at games, it's only natural to stand when you sing.

‘Safe standing areas exist on the continent and the FSF believes they should be introduced into our grounds as well. These areas are modern and safe, a million miles from the crumbling death traps of the 80s.

‘It's fantastic to see fans, clubs, and politicians coming together to deliver this message to Westminster. We need a safe standing pilot - and why shouldn't that be in Wales?’ Standing areas at football grounds in the Premier League and Championship has been outlawed since 1994 at the recommendation of the Taylor Report on the Hillsborough disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool supporters.
