Scotland newcomer Matt Ritchie has revealed he thought he was the victim of a prank when Gordon Strachan first rang him about a call-up.

The Bournemouth winger was the surprise name in the 26-man pool announced on Monday for the forthcoming friendly against Northern Ireland and Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar.

Ritchie was born in the Hampshire town of Gosport but qualifies for Scotland through his father Alex.

The 25-year-old admits he has never actually been north of the border but – once he had recovered from his initial shock - convinced Strachan he was passionate about wearing a dark blue jersey.

‘I had a call a couple of weeks ago from the manager,’ said Ritchie. ‘That was a massive surprise and at first I thought it was a prank call.

‘I’m absolutely delighted to be involved and it’s a proud moment for me and my family.

‘To be involved with a national football team is a great achievement and a dream come true as a young footballer.’

Ritchie – who has scored 11 goals for the Championship leaders this season - also explained the background that made him eligible to be Strachan’s latest recruit.

‘My dad was born in Edinburgh and so were my grandparents,’ he said. ‘My granddad was in the Royal Navy and they moved to England after he had been posted to Portsmouth, which is where I grew up.

‘I’ve still got relatives in Scotland but my aunties and uncles always seem to come down here to see my nan and granddad so I haven’t actually been to Scotland. But I’ve got family there and I’m sure they will come to the games if I’m involved.

‘My dad is over the moon. Hopefully he’ll be able to come to the games and watch me if I’m involved.’

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe recently handed Ritchie a new three-year contract and believes his record in terms of both goals and assists make him a genuine international contender.

‘We were aware that Gordon (Strachan) rates Matt highly,’ said Howe.

‘I’m really pleased for him because he has been consistent for us for a long time now.

‘There are only a few goal scorers and goal creators around and I think he deserves his call-up. It’s a good moment for him.’

Recent Celtic recruits Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were notable omissions from Strachan’s squad, with both having impressed since their January moves from Dundee United.

The Scotland boss, though, seemed to suggest the pair were simply carrying on at the same level they had been performing at while at Tannadice, asking: ‘Have they kicked on? Or are they the same players they were five or six months ago?’

But Celtic assistant manager John Collins admitted he thought they had done enough to earn a place in the squad, saying: ‘I have got to be honest, I am surprised that they were not called up.

‘They have done very well for us but the their time will come. They are young players and I have no doubt they will get themselves into Scotland squads of the future.

‘In the six or seven weeks they have been here, their performances out on the pitch and in training have been excellent.

‘They have lots of talent and are only going to get better with age.

‘Gordon has got lots of good players to pick from and it’s a tough job. But their time will come.’
