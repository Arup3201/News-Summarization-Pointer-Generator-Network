Jewellery tycoon: Ranbir Singh Suri was made a peer because he is a 'leading figure' among Sikhs

He's the Tory party donor who was made a peer because he is a ‘leading figure’ among Sikhs.

The only problem is, other prominent Sikhs say they have never heard of Ranbir Singh Suri.

The jewellery tycoon – dubbed the King of Bling – was elevated to the House of Lords by David Cameron last week after giving the Conservatives £310,000.

Tory chiefs dismissed cries of ‘cash for peerages’ by saying he was a pillar of the Sikh community.

But yesterday there was embarrassment for the party when the Sikh  community begged to differ. 

‘We have not come across this individual before,’ said Gurmel Singh, secretary general of the Sikh Council UK, the largest Sikh representative body in the country.

‘The first time I heard of him was when his name was mentioned [as a new peer].’

Lord Suri, 79, was described by Downing Street as a businessman and ‘former general secretary of the Board of British Sikhs’.

But records show the Board has not existed for more than 20 years. It ran for just two years and involved only four or five people.

According to documents at Companies House, it was incorporated in 1990 and dissolved two years later, with insiders telling The Independent it ‘fizzled out’ after a couple of meetings.

Tory claims that the donor had ‘leading’ status within his community were dismissed as a ‘barefaced lie’ by another prominent Sikh organisation.

The Sikh Federation (UK) said in a statement: ‘He is no leading figure in Britain’s Sikh community and he is not associated with any of the leading Sikh organisations. Many in the Sikh community simply see Lord Suri as a businessman who has donated large sums of money [to the Tories].’

It added: ‘The Federation has been campaigning for over a decade for more visible Sikhs in  Parliament. On the one hand this move is welcome, but we would prefer each of the main political parties to have Sikhs in the House of Lords who are younger, there on merit and based on what they have to offer rather than those who are seen as “cronies”.’

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of Lord Suri, who was a magistrate for more than a decade.

He built Oceanic Jewellers into an international success story after establishing it in 1976 and in 2009 his family’s fortune was estimated to be £40million.

He is now one of Britain’s richest Asians who has regularly featured in the Sunday Times Rich List.

A member of the Renaissance Forum, an exclusive dinner club open only to those who have donated more than £10,000 to the party, he has been an active member of the Conservative Party for more than 30 years and describes Mr Cameron as ‘delightful and a good leader’.

However, Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi said last night: ‘There are questions to answer here, not least for the Government who, on elevating this Tory donor to the Lords, justified it on the basis that he held a post which doesn’t seem to have existed for over a decade.’ 

She questioned whether the suitability of the appointment was discussed with the House of Lords Appointments Commission, which vets nominations for new peerages. ‘People will rightly want to get to the bottom of this issue before another Tory donor is sworn in to the Lords,’ she added. 

The Appointments Commission said its job was limited to checking an individual’s ‘propriety’.

A spokesman stressed: ‘Assessing the suitability of those nominated by political parties is a matter for the parties themselves.’

Lord Suri’s peerage will lead to further calls for the controversial system of patronage to be scrapped.

The Prime Minister has now handed out more than 180 peerages, swelling the total to 850 – making the House of Lords bigger than at any time since most hereditary seats were removed in 1999.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Beyond his extensive career in business, Ranbir Suri has devoted the last 40 years to a range of charitable and voluntary positions, including General Secretary of the Board of British Sikhs in 1991/92.’

Lord Suri’s office said he was unavailable for comment. But a family friend said: ‘He is a prominent member of the Sikh community, because he is rich, but he is not a leader of it, and nor would he ever claim to be. 

‘He is an extremely humble man who arrived as an immigrant from Kenya in 1973 with very little and worked hard to build himself a business.’
