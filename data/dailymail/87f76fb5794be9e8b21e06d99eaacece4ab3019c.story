It has been an amazing year of football in many different ways, from the highs and lows of the World Cup — Germany’s highs and England’s lows — to the Premier League title race.

For my last column of 2014, I thought I would dish out some awards for my personal highlights. I’m looking forward to another enthralling time in 2015. Merry Christmas!

My Three Kings of 2014 

Raheem Sterling — No one has grown more as a player in the last 12 months than Sterling. This time last year he had just broken into the Liverpool team and now, at 20, he is one of the best young players in the world. And if his form isn’t quite what it was, that’s only to be expected from a developing talent.

John Terry has defied those who said age had caught up with him to produce some stunning form

John Terry — He’s as solid as he was 10 years ago. When analysing on TV, nobody says, ‘He’s short for pace there’ or ‘He turned a bit slowly here’. There’s no sign of frailties and there’s not a better defender in the country. Terry with Gary Cahill would have been fabulous at the World Cup, and it would be now.

Stewart Downing — He looked as though his career might ebb away, having left Liverpool with a big move not having worked out. But credit to Sam Allardyce, who has had him playing off the front in many games and seen him rejuvenated. Now the challenge is to sustain that and earn an England place.

Goal of the Year

I was in the Maracana on that evening when James Rodriguez scored for Colombia in the last 16 of the World Cup against Uruguay. He had his back to play and four players closing him but the key for me was the fact he had a little glance before he shot. You teach midfielders to look frequently over their shoulder for all-around awareness — but to do that then play it off his chest and turn was unbelievable.

Stewart Downing's career looked as though it was in decline but this season he has had a renaissance

The finish over the goalkeeper and off the bar was sensational but, even before that, he had shown fantastic awareness and skill. The early stages of the World Cup were fabulous and James played a huge part in lighting up the tournament.

Match of the Year

There can’t be any dispute about this. When Brazil took the field in Belo Horizonte on July 8, we were all anticipating a tight game with Germany as marginal favourites.

What unfolded in the first half was the most extraordinary and unusual result I’ve experienced in football. It was as though Brazil were having a collective breakdown. Although they were missing Neymar and Thiago Silva, to watch a team filled with world class and experienced players capitulate in quite such a dramatic way, at home and in front of their own fans, was astounding. It was a seismic football moment.

There can be little dispute that Brazil's capitulation was the most engrossing match of 2014

Buys of the Year

When you look at the most astute transfers, Chelsea’s signing of Nemanja Matic last January and Alex Song’s return to English football in the summer are right up there. But Song isn’t even the best buy at his club — that honour falls on Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia.

That’s a huge compliment to Sam Allardyce. Real football people wouldn’t doubt him but he has gone from being under pressure at West Ham, with the fans discontented, to having engineered their best start in the Premier League and much of it is down to clever recruitment. There aren’t many undiscovered gems any more but plucking a player like Sakho from Metz in the French second division is as close as you get. Valencia shone in the World Cup but there can always be a risk buying on the back of a good tournament — but West Ham had clearly done their homework.

West Ham get the ball down and play with those two, hitting teams on the break; when Andy Carroll comes in, they go a bit more direct. They have two ways to play now — Valencia and Sakho have added a new dimension to their game.

Tactical Innovation of the Year

The best ideas never disappear; they simply come back into fashion in a new guise. It’s no secret that I’ve enjoyed playing the back three and did so with England in the late 90s, but the system became less used in recent years.

Slowly it is has come back, with coaches such as Pep Guardiola, Steve Bruce and Roberto Martinez using it at times, but really it was the World Cup that brought it right back in to the mainstream. There’s a whole generation of players now who struggle to play against it and Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli, Costa Rica’s Jorge Luis Pinto, Louis van Gaal for Holland, Mexico’s Miguel Herrera and Algeria’s Vahid Halilhodzic caused teams so many problems with it during the tournament and I for one loved watching it.

Costa Rica excelled at the World Cup, in part due to the tactical decisions of their manager Jorge Luis Pinto

Man of the Year — Jose Mourinho

It may be an obvious choice but it’s hard to get away from just how well his time at Chelsea is going — though the test will be whether he wins something.

He made a profit for the club in the summer transfer window and still ended up with a stronger team. The balance of the side is lovely. Don’t forget, Mourinho is having to accommodate the desire of the owner for attractive football but he’s doing that without compromising his principles.

I love the fact he fielded a strong side at Derby in the Capital One Cup — he wants to win every single game. I think he’s doing an even better job than the last time he was at Stamford Bridge. They’re chasing four trophies and I believe they will at least have the Premier League title in 2015 — and maybe they can challenge Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona for the Champions League.

And the manager for next year? Eddie Howe

His Bournemouth side might have lost to Liverpool on Wednesday night but the job Eddie Howe has done on the south coast is extraordinary. He took over when they were second bottom of League Two. He had 18 months at Burnley, which just didn’t work out, but now he has Bournemouth on the verge of the Premier League, playing attractive football.

They have been helped financially by Russian owner Maxim Demin but, nevertheless, Howe, at 37, has demonstrated that he should have a long career in the game. We might be seeing a lot more of him in 2015.
