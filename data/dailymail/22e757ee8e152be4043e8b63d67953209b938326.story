Nigeria's president 
nearly swapped Boko Haram prisoners for the girls the
 group is holding hostage after he was delivered a video of them begging
 him to make the deal, it is claimed.

But
 Goodluck Jonathan is said to have scrapped the arrangement under 
pressure from Western governments, who did not want him to negotiate with the Islamist insurgents.

The
 claims come as Boko Haram fighters today killed 24 policemen and 
soldiers in a single attack and Cameroon deployed a thousand men to its 
border to counter the Islamist threat.

Pressure: Goodluck Jonathan at the Paris Summit for Security in Nigeria earlier this month. It is claimed that he scrapped a plan to exchange Boko Haram prisoners for schoolgirls held captive by the group after attending

The
 video was apparently handed to Mr Jonathan's office by a Nigerian 
journalist with contacts in Boko Haram, who obtained it as a way of 
proving he was in contact with rebel leaders.

But
 a source close to the militia told The Telegraph that a deal to then 
release some of the girls was abandoned after the president came under 
pressure to play hardball in negotiations.

Nigeria's
 government has denied that any such deal was mooted and has neither 
confirmed nor denied the existence of a video, according to The 
Telegraph's Colin Freeman.

Yesterday,
 Nigeria's chief of defence staff claimed the military had discovered 
the whereabouts of the 276 girls Boko Haram snatched from their boarding
 school dormitories seven weeks ago.

Air
 Marshal Alex Badeh said: 'The good news for the parents of the girls is
 that we know where they are, but we cannot tell you. But where they are
 held, can we go there with force? We can't kill our girls in the name 
of trying to get them back.'

The
 girls have been tracked to three camps in the north of Nigeria, near 
Lake Chad, 200 miles from where they were abducted, senior officials 
told a Nigerian newspaper on Friday.

A still taken from a video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network shows the missing girls. A top Nigerian military official says the authorities know where the girls are, but cannot move in over fears for their safety

The
 source of the video said to show some of the girls is Ahmed Salkida, a 
journalist from the same north-east state of Borno where the Boko Haram 
insurgency has its stronghold, said The Telegraph's source.

Mr
 Salkida has on past occasions been arrested on suspicion of being a 
Boko Haram sympathiser and has been in effective exile from Nigeria with
 his family in Dubai for the past two years.

About
 a month ago, however, Nigerian officials agreed to allow Mr Salkida to 
return so he could help negotiate the release of the captive girls. He initially feared he might face arrest, but was then given a letter of indemnity signed by the president when he flew to Nigeria.

Along
 with a trusted cleric he embarked on a dangerous trek into the bush to 
track down the militant group and was able to meet with a senior 
assistant of Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram's leader.

'The
 government said to the intermediary to prove himself to show whether he
 was capable of brokering a deal or not, and insisted that he should 
obtain proof of life of the hostages,' the source said.

'So
 during his talks with the insurgents, he obtained a DVD which had clips
 of girls being interviewed by members of the group, in which they asked
 President Jonathan to do a prisoner swap to get them freed.'

Off
 the back of the video, a deal was struck to release 50 of the girls in 
exchange for an equal number of Boko Haram prisoners for last Monday. 
But the government backed out at the last minute.

The
 source pointed out that the weekend before the planned swap Mr Jonathan
 met with British and American officials at a crisis summit in Paris, 
which was also attended by the governments of Niger, Cameroon and Mali.

He
 may have been afraid that if he had gone through with the deal he would
 have lost the support of the West, the source said. Talks with Boko 
Haram subsequently broke down and Mr Salkida returned to Dubai, it is 
claimed.

Boko Haram  leader Abubakar Shekau offered to trade the girls for the release of prisoners, which was declined by the Nigerian government

The new account of 
the behind the scenes negotiations between Boko Haram and the Nigerian 
government comes as militants attacked a military base and police 
barracks, killing 24 police and soldiers.

The
 attack occurred not far from where the Islamist insurgents shot or 
burned to death 59 pupils at a boarding school in February, Reuters 
reported.

Meanwhile a 
spokesman for Cameroon's defence ministry announced that a 1,000 
soldiers backed up with armoured vehicles had been sent to its border 
with Nigeria, to counter a rising threat from Boko Haram.

'Their
 mission will be to carry out reconnaissance and be ready to respond 
with enough fire power,' Lieutenant Colonel Didier Badjeck told Reuters 
by telephone from Yaounde.

Boko
 Haram, which outraged international opinion with the mass abduction of 
schoolgirls from their boarding school in Chibok, in Nigeria's Borno 
State, has also carried out attacks in northern Cameroon.

It is suspected of attacking a Chinese workers camp there this month.
