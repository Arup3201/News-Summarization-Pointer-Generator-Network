Where do superheroes go when they need a cut and blow dry? To Mr Universe of course!

And at 17st with a massive 58in chest, one hairdressing body builder hopes that the much sought-after title will soon be his.

Muscular Simon Ackroyd, 45, from Cheadle, Cheshire, splits his time between working in a salon and bodybuilding, as he works towards claiming the title once held by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Gentle giant: Simon has been hairdressing for 30 years, and says he is not as intimidating as his physique might make him appear

The father of four has been body building for 18 years and eats a whopping 6,000 calories a day in order to maintain his sculptured physique.

Hitting the gym for two hours a day, five days a week has left him with 21in biceps and 29in thighs.

But Simon, who has been hairdressing for 30 years, says he is not as intimidating as he appears: 'The difference between body-building and my job is mad but I’ve always been a gentle guy.

'Some people judge me as some kind of monster, but when they talk to me they realise I am a nice bloke.

‘People will walk past with their mouths hanging open. No-one expects a guy like me to be working in a hairdressers. I have a lot of regular clients and they all love it though. They’re all dead proud.’

Unlikely stylist: 'When people see me they sometimes get a shock. No-one expects a guy like me to be working in a hairdressers' says Simon

Winning Mr Universe has long been Simon’s dream, and he says that to take home the title at the Mr Universe competition in Southport on October 25 would mean ‘everything’ to him.

‘Everything I’ve done for the last 18 years will come down to that moment. It’s all about getting your condition right on the day.’

The impressive specimen entered his first competition in 2007 and won the ‘Over 40s’ prize at the National Amateur Body Builders’ Association Championships.

Gigantic appetite: Simon eats 6,000 calories a day to stay in shape, includings six portions of cod, and rice with every meal

However, his wife Jenny, 49, is growing tired of preparing the mammoth meals needed to fuel her husband’s colossal body.

‘She’s sick of it to be honest,’ says Simon. ‘When I start my diet I’ll drop down to 4,000 calories. This will include six 400g portions of cod a day, with 100g of rice with every meal.

‘If I do well in Mr Universe, I’ll go for Mr World the following year but then she said I have to retire.’

Winning would mean everything: Simon has had his sights set on the title for the last 18 years

But though his wife won’t miss the cause of Simon’s huge appetite, the couple’s children - Mia, 19, Kai, 17, Louie, 12 and Gabriel, nine – are their father’s biggest fans.

Daughter Kai said ‘It’s great because he enjoys it and he puts his heart into it.

‘We’re definitely going to be supporting him. I just really hope he gets placed.’
