Former Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli has ignored all of the furore caused by him posing with what appeared to be a gun on Instagram by going jet-skiing with his fiancee Fanny Neguesha.

The AC Milan star enjoyed a day at the beach with Neguesha during their vacation in Miami as he recovers from Italy's group stage exit at the World Cup in Brazil.

Balotelli has been linked with a move to Arsenal this summer and he is still relaxing before he returns to Milan for pre-season training.

The 23-year-old had earlier posted a photo of himself posing with what appeared to be a gun on Instagram.

He can be seen pointing the gun at the camera in the 
photo, which was accompanied with the message 'big kiss to all the 
haters'.

Balotelli later deleted the post. The move angered Balotelli's 
employers AC Milan but vice president Adriano Galliani admits the club 
are powerless to stop players using social networks.

Galliani 
said: 'I have my own ideas about social networks and I've tried many 
times but our lawyer has always stopped me, saying that it would violate
 individual rights.

'In
 contracts it's written what players can and cannot do, but we can't do 
anything regarding their private lives. We do it vocally but that's not 
enough.'
