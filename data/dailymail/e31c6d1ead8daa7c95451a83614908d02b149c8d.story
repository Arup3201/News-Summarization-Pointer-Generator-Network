A globetrotting bunny has been stolen after travelling the world to take snaps with its adventurous owner.

Travel Bunny - as it is aptly known - visited more than 20 countries, taking an enviable series of snaps along the way with owner Peter Franc, from London.

But after posing for snaps around the world, taking in iconic location from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in Italy, to the Great Barrier Reef, in Australia, Travel Bunny was cruelly stolen from Peter's car. 

Enjoying the glamour: On his travels, the bunny managed to visit Dubai and see the iconic Burj al Arab hotel, shaped like a sail

La dolce vita: Travel Bunny also worked his way around Italy, visiting sights like the Leaning Tower of Pisa

Asian adventure: Travel Bunny also managed to see Angkor Wat, in Siem Reap, Cambodia, while travelling around South East Asia

The 33-year-old said the rabbit was stolen from his car in Italy, along with his passports, camera equipment and laptop.

He said: 'I left my car unattended in a highway petrol station car park for less than two minutes, but it was enough time for the criminals to break the door open and relieve us of some possessions.' 

Peter, who is originally from Melbourne, Australia, began his adventure with Travel Bunny in 2005, after moving to Berlin.

He said: 'I'd always loved rabbits, and received my first pet, creatively named "Bunny" when I was 8.

'When I moved to Berlin in 2005, I was given a toy rabbit for my birthday.

'Since it was the first time I was away from my parents, I had travel on my mind, and simply thought taking Travel Bunny on my trips would be a cute way to document where I'd been, to show my friends back home.'

Czech mate: The rabbit also posed in front of Prague Castle on his travels through Europe with Peter, before he was stolen in 2010

Peter travelled around the world with Travel Bunny, exploring a long list of countries including Germany, Norway, New Zealand, Italy, Singapore, Dubai, England, Australia and Vietnam.

He said: 'I've been on many travels with many different people, and they've always loved being part of the Travel Bunny experience - seeing the photo from a particular place, and knowing they were there too.

'Most people look strangely at me, until they realise what I'm doing.

Go east: Travel Bunny also made it to Russia to pose in front of the Church of Our Saviour on Spilled Blood in St Petersburg

'I've had people take photos of me taking my photo, and some people have even requested to also take a photo of Travel Bunny - either on his own, or with them in front of the same scene!'

After visiting 24 countries with Travel Bunny, Peter is now on a mission to try to re-create him after he was stolen in 2010.

He says: 'Since he was taken from me, I've spent a long time trying to recreate him.

In a bid to be reunited with his bunny, Peter has scoured online for similar plush toy rabbits and even approached companies in China to have the doll remade.

He says: 'I attempted having one hand-made, but he just didn't turn out right.

'I would love the opportunity to have a new Travel Bunny made up - since being stolen I've visited 20 or more countries where Travel Bunny could have visited.

'The series of photos has always been a light-hearted project.

'One to bring a smile to people's faces, and to remind them how wonderful our world is, and how easy it is to get around.'
