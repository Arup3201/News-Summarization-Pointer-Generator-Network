Many of us spend our lives in black, brown, navy, white and grey, but by choosing safe shades instead of a brighter wardrobe, we could be missing out on the health benefits implicit in colour.

Jules Standish, author of How Not To Wear Black, is a style and colour consultant for women afraid of standing out, and she believes that changing your shopping habits can boost your well-being and self-esteem. ‘Research shows that colours can have a psychological effect,’ she says. ‘When we look at certain colours it triggers neurological responses in the brain, and causes the hypothalamus gland to release hormones.

‘Looking at warm, bright colours, such as red or pink, releases dopamine — known as the “feel-good hormone” — which can improve our mood, heighten the attention span and even boost our sex drive.

‘Cool blues, on the other hand, have been linked to the release of oxytocin, making you feel of calm.’ Here, Jules gives her verdict on the clashing colours that couldn’t be more suited.

GREEN AND MAROON

Dress, £40, virgoslounge.com

Rada necklace, £279, Fenwick, 020 7629 9161

‘Red and green should never be seen’ couldn’t be more wrong. In small doses, they work superbly well together. Pairing this green dress with red accessories, for instance.

Emerald-green is a good choice if you suffer from blushing after drinking wine, or menopausal hot flushes, as it helps to balance out the complexion.

SCARLET AND BURGUNDY

Necklace, £18.50, topshop.com

Our brains associate colours with temperature, so scarlet is at the hottest end of the colour spectrum. Scarlet and burgundy are both universally flattering and suit almost every skin tone and hair colour.

Bright red also triggers the pituitary and adrenal glands, which can lead to increased metabolism and weight loss, so it’s great for a dieter. Pairing red with an equal amount of a darker shade, like burgundy, tones down flamboyance.

CYAN AND PURPLE 

Wishbone coat, £85, johnlewis.com

LK Bennett dress, £250, clutch, £150, Fenwick, 020 7629 9161

Earrings, £40, stelladot.co.uk

Shoes, £24.99, missguided.co.uk

This combination is often thought garish, but here the cyan, or bright blue, helps to tone down the purple.

Bright blue suits most skin tones and helps to brighten the complexion. It’s proven that, if you suffer from stress, wearing blue can help as it stimulates the release of the calming hormone oxytocin.

MUSTARD AND KHAKI

Shirt, £95, hobbs.co.uk

Gerard Darel trousers, £190, johnlewis.com

Sandals, £24.99, missguided.co.uk Cuff, £65, stelladot.co.uk

Ordinarily, yellows and greens would not be worn together, but toning it down and pairing mustard with khaki is flattering. These earthy shades have golden undertones that illuminate greying, older skin.

Khaki is a flattering alternative to black for those of a certain age. And if mustard is still too bold for you, add gold accessories instead.

FUCHSIA AND COBALT

Pyrus jacket, £225, Fenwick, 020 7629 9161

Pink dress, £40, hm.com

Shoes, £65, dunelondon.com Necklace, £22, accessorize.com

The phrase ‘pretty in pink’ really does work for all women, particularly those entering the menopause, as pink is associated with youth and femininity.

Research also suggests that men prefer women in pink, as it’s the closest colour to skin.

The flattering shade of cobalt blue complements the pink and is suited to most skin tones, drawing attention away from dark circles under the eyes.

YELLOW AND PURPLE

LK Bennett top, £165, Fenwick, 020 7629 9161

Yanny London skirt, £85, houseoffraser.co.uk 

Shoes, £95, russellandbromley.co.uk

IN THIS combination, the dark purple on top draws the eye downwards, creating a lean silhouette and hiding problem areas around the waist.

Purple is a calming colour — its pacifying effect makes it one of the best shades to wear when feeling overwrought. Research has found that we associate yellow with joy, so wearing it can boost your mood.

BURGUNDY AND PALE PINK 

Leather pencil skirt, £149, marksandspencer.com

DKNY block shirt, £90, Fenwick, 020 7629 9161 

Satin slingbacks, £185, lucychoilondon.com

Like fuchsia, pale pink is a feminine and youthful colour, but it is more wearable than its brighter counterpart. Add touches of burgundy to make it more elegant.

Pale pink can be worn well into your 60s, and works for those who don’t feel comfortable in attention-grabbing shades. A silk blouse with a burgundy leather skirt softens the outfit.
