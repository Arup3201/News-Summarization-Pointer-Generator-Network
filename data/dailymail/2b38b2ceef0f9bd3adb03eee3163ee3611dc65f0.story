A woman who was nearly killed in a horrific car crash has made a miraculous recovery to become a champion triathlete.

Less than a year ago, Jackie Stretton was fighting for her life after she was involved in a pile-up caused by thieves on the run from police.

She was put into a drug-induced coma after suffering a broken back, broken leg and bleeding on the brain.

The 26-year-old was warned she would never compete again but she has stunned doctors with her enthusiastic return to sport.

Jackie Stretton suffered a broken back, broken leg and head injury in a car crash which was caused by car thieves involved in a police chase

Ms Stretton said: ‘Doctors told me I should never race again because of knee ligament damage sustained in the crash but I didn't want to let two people driving like idiots ruin my life.

‘I am the kind of person who, as soon as someone tells me I can't do something, I am determined that I will do it.

‘I proved a point to myself, I would hope that it shows other people that sometimes really bad things happen but it should never change your aims, ambitions and dreams.’

Ms Stretton, of Chelmsford, Essex, who accepts that doctors would not encourage her involvement in triathlons, admitted the past year had been an emotional rollercoaster.

She said: ‘I can't believe it has been a year - I spent six months lying on a sofa and six months trying to live the life I missed out on, I suppose.

‘When I returned for my first triathlon, my only aim was to compete so when I won, it was an amazing feeling.

‘It made all the hard work and determination worth it.’

Ms Stretton was nearly killed when she became the innocent victim of a high-speed police chase which had started in Suffolk.

Before the crash, she took part in triathlons and other adventure races. She was told she wouldn't be able to compete again as a result of her injuries

After the crash, Ms Stretton set herself the goal of returning to competitive sport before her 26th birthday - an aim which she achieved with just days to spare. She is pictured running just before the crash

Tyrell O'Donnell, 20, from Torquay, Devon and Jason Young, 21, from Axminster, Devon, lost control of their Fiat Stilo on the A414 in Danbury, Essex, after the 100mph pursuit.

The chase had crossed two counties before the pair's vehicle collided with a blue Beetle which then smashed into Ms Stretton’s tiny hatchback sending her head-on into a pursuing police car.

However, she was determined to return to competition before her 26th birthday - and she managed the feat with two days to spare.

She took part in a ‘Tri-Adventure’ which saw her endure two hours of running, cycling and orienteering in Surrey.

She went on to win the first triathlon she took part in after returning to competitive sport

Her next challenge is competing in a gruelling ironman event in Scotland in June to raise funds for the Essex Air Ambulance who airlifted her to hospital following the accident.

The gruelling City to Summit event involves a 2.4-mile swim in Edinburgh, a 112-mile bike ride and then 26.2-mile off-road marathon to the summit of Ben Nevis.

She said: ‘I booked myself on to that race when I was lying in a back brace on my sofa.

‘It was my ambition - I knew I was going to get better if I kept my focus on doing that race - I had something to strive for.

‘To have come through something so horrific just showed me that I am quite strong and capable of a lot, more than I thought I was.’

As a result of her injuries, for months Ms Stretton could only stand with the help of a back brace

Judge Rodger Hayward-Smith QC made headlines in August last year as he bemoaned sentencing guidelines which only allowed him to sentence the pair to 18 months and 16 months imprisonment, respectively, for aggravated vehicle taking.

He stunned onlookers at Chelmsford Crown Court saying: ‘You will get out of prison and will get your life back but Jackie Stretton will never get over this, physically or mentally.

‘It is absurd - if I just pass sentence and allow credit for your guilty pleas, because I have to - it will not be enough.

‘It is awful. I am stuck with it because of what the law says and I can't abide it.’

However, Ms Stretton has not let the justice system soften her resolve despite the pair being released earlier this year after serving just half of their sentence.

The Sainsbury’s product manager said: ‘That's the criminal justice system for you.'

Having regained her fitness, she now plans to raise money for the Essex Air Ambulance which airlifted her to hospital after the crash

She admitted crying every day following the accident after being told she may never compete in competitive sport again.

At first she could not feed herself and could stand up for less than a minute at a time without the help of a back brace.

But now she has moved into her own flat and she continues to rebuild her life.

She said: ‘The last 12 months has been a real emotional journey. My lowest point was when my leg cast came off and I couldn't bend my knee at all.

‘There were a lot of points where I thought I would be like this forever. It was horrendous but I just kept pushing myself a little further every day.

‘I have been pretty much working, training at the gym and racing.

‘They [the thieves] have got over it, but I want to show them that what they did could not destroy my life.

‘It
was really upsetting to see that they were both released, but fingers 
crossed they have both learned their lesson and they won't hurt anyone 
else.

‘I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy.’
