Who's laughing now? Sarah Millican has become one of the best-paid comedians on the planet

To her fans she is the archetypal working-class heroine. Geordie accent? Check. Coal-miner father?

Check. Cramped terrace home in a down-at-heel but close-knit community? Once upon a time . . . but not any more.

Times are changing for stand-up comedian Sarah Millican and as she wakes up this morning in her gated mansion in Cheshire’s stockbroker belt, she will not be worrying about the mortgage repayments.

With five bedrooms, a library, conservatory and enough garage space for four cars, there is no shortage of space either.

Especially considering her only housemates are Gary Delaney, her fellow comedian and partner of seven years, and a pair of cats (the younger of whom is named Lieutenant Ripley after the heroine of the Alien movies).

Millican may still have the common touch on stage, but accounts revealed this week that the company through which she runs her affairs had nearly £2.5million in the bank this time last year — £2million more than in 2011.

Her luxurious home, nestled in the leafy fringes of Mere in Cheshire, cost her £1.3million when she bought it in 2012.

This is a woman who in five years has gone from a virtual unknown to one of the best-paid comedians on the planet. More to the point, she has done so by staying true to herself and her working-class roots.

Only a few months ago, she was living in the rented flat in the heart of Manchester she had called home for six years. It was on one of the busiest roads and not far from some of the toughest estates.

Her boyfriend lived 80 miles away in Birmingham — an endless source of gags for her stage routine. But the time had come to start living according to her means.

And as she does so, her former husband Andrew — the man whose walk-out devastated and inspired her — will be looking on with envy.

Where precisely that will be, no one knows, for he has disappeared since his former wife hit the big time.

While Sarah, 37, has spoken at length about her divorce — indeed, her first stand-up routine was based on it — until now very little has been known about the man who propelled her to success by tearing her life apart.

In interviews and on stage she has refused to identify him, while going into forensic detail in her act about the day he calmly informed her he didn’t love her and was leaving.

This week, however, I spoke to Andrew’s sister at her semi-detached home in Jarrow, Tyne & Wear.

Michelle Millican, 38, who was a full-time carer for her mother until she died earlier this year, told me: ‘Andrew broke Sarah’s heart, but that’s what my brother is like. Everyone knows he’s a bit of an a***hole.

‘We lost our mother a few months ago and I couldn’t even get hold of him to tell him. He would always do that — he goes off for a couple of years at a time and comes back as if nothing has happened. But not this time. The last time I saw him was at our dad’s funeral ten years ago.

‘None of his friends know where he is now, no one in the family. I spoke to Sarah recently to see if she knows where he is and she doesn’t have a clue. She doesn’t want to know. She prefers to cut all ties and I don’t blame her. For all we know he might have changed his name.’

Sarah has made no secret of the fact her divorce, which came out of the blue ten years ago, prompted her to take the plunge as a stand-up comedian.

She had met Andrew at the age of 21 when they worked in a cinema on the outskirts of Newcastle. Within a year they had caught a flight to Las Vegas to get married.

They settled into a workaday life, with Sarah taking a job as a civil servant, while home was a series of cramped maisonettes. It was a humdrum, but — to Sarah’s mind at least — happy existence.

That illusion was shattered overnight when Andrew dumped her. At 29, stripped of all optimism and self-belief, she moved back in with her parents.

By her own account, she would spend hours lying face down on her sister’s bed, sobbing. But on other days she felt strangely energised and started attending evening classes to develop her stagecraft.

Within a year she was performing stand-up in comedy clubs and became runner-up in the BBC New Comedy Awards.

While still playing small venues, she took great encouragement from the crowd reactions and spent the next three years honing her craft until she was ready to make her Edinburgh Festival debut. The show, Sarah Millican’s Not Nice (based on her divorce), took the Newcomer Award. She has not looked back.

Since then she has become a regular on panel shows, played sell-out tours across the country, had her own Radio 4 show, released two smash-hit live DVDs and last year was given her own series on BBC2, The Sarah Millican  Television Programme.

One critic described her as ‘the most rapidly evolved national treasure in British light entertainment, basking in ubiquity’.

That was two years ago and she has not slowed down since then. ‘The person you see on stage is totally her,’ says Michelle. ‘All the little stories she tells about her dad, they’re all just real life. It reminds me of when we used to have a glass of wine together, sit and tell family stories. That’s just the way she tells them on stage.

‘Her dad’s the same. They don’t mean to be especially funny — that’s the way they are. They’re a family of comedians.

‘I’m so pleased Sarah is moving in with her new lad. I love her.

‘Some people have been surprised by how well she’s done, but I’m not. Most comedians do the circuit for years and years before they’re even heard of, but she’s so amazing she just pinged into it straight away.’

All this success has brought material rewards, though such is the nature of showbusiness that it is only in the past couple of years that Sarah has been pulling in bigger pay cheques.

Accounts for her company, SM Comedy, show that in 2011 she had an income of £590,000. Last year the company’s earnings leapt by £2 million and continue to grow.

Nevertheless, with another successful DVD released since then, a record-breaking tour called Chatterbox under her belt and another 130 dates lined up over the next year, those earnings are only going to go up.

Her website is full of merchandising offers, including signed DVDs at £15 each (which, given the DVD normally costs £6, means that her signature is valued at £9).

Small wonder she has moved into more salubrious surroundings, with her new neighbours including the solicitor Nick ‘Mr Loophole’ Freeman and Coronation Street legend Barbara Knox, who plays Rita Tanner.

The houses are hidden away behind high walls, hedges and electronic gates, and are just a short distance from the picturesque 1,000-acre Tatton Park.

The nearest town is Knutsford, where the car salesrooms are Rolls-Royce and McLaren (one of only three garages in the country to sell the super- expensive sports cars).

She has come a long way from South Shields, yet it is telling that through it all she has kept her former husband’s name (she was born Sarah King).

Her normality (she professes to prefer ‘watching telly’ to reading books) masks an extraordinary dedication to the job.

She does not drink and drives 50,000 miles a year to performances. One of the main reasons she chose her new mansion was its proximity to the M6.

Success has also bred a degree of suspicion and she can be extremely guarded in interviews.

While her act consists of cheerfully spilling intimate tales (such as the occasion when she lost control of her bladder in a car and blamed it on a friend’s dog), off-stage she goes to great lengths to keep her private life private.

This penchant for mystery may well be the last thing she has in common with her former husband.

He marked his 40th birthday last month without making any attempt to contact family or friends from home. But his sister feels confident he would be ‘torn apart’ by his former wife’s success.

‘One thing I can tell you for sure is that he’ll be absolutely raging about Sarah because he was very money-orientated,’ says Michelle. ‘That used to be the only time Mum and Dad would see him: if he wanted cash.

‘So I think the green-eyed monster will be there, which, to be honest, I think is quite good because after what he did he deserves it.

‘Sarah knows that as well. She was devastated by what he did to her. But she now knows she’s definitely got the better of the deal.’
