It seemed quite appropriate that a year to the day since Saido Berahino announced his ability to the Premier League with a winner at Old Trafford, he scored a double that just might earn him an England call-up.

Those 365 days have encompassed an awful lot for this 21-year-old who is still learning and improving, both on and off the pitch.

They include eight goals for Gareth Southgate’s Under 21 side but also the moment he was allegedly punched by James Morrison in a dressing-room dust-up, and the time he was filmed inhaling potentially dangerous laughing gas through a balloon.

It looked like he might leave the club he has called home since the age of 11 in the aftermath of those events but instead he has buckled down and is now reaping the rewards.

There is dedication in his training, often staying behind after sessions to work on his game, and his fitness has improved – aided by a personal trainer.

This season he has emerged the striker to whom Alan Irvine can hand responsibility of leading the line, with £10million Brown Ideye and Victor Anichebe struggling with injuries.

Saido Berahino boasts a better goals per game ratio than all the other English strikers playing in the Premier League this season.  

Berahino - 4 goals in 6 games (0.67) 

Wayne Rooney - 3 goals in 6 games (0.50) 

Charlie Austin - 2 goals in 5 games (0.40)

Gabby Agbonlahor - 2 goals in 6 games (0.33)

Frazier Campbell - 2 goals in 6 games (0.33) 

Daniel Sturridge - 1 goal in 3 games (0.33)

Carlton Cole - 1 goal in 4 games (0.25)

Jamie Vardy - 1 goal in 4 games (0.25)

Dwight Gayle - 1 goal in 4 games (0.25)

Peter Crouch - 1 goal in 5 games (0.20)

Danny Welbeck - 1 goal in 5 games (0.20)

David Nugent - 1 goal in 6 games (0.17)

Berahino scored two on the opening day against Sunderland, came off the bench to snatch a dramatic late win over Hull in the Capital One Cup, and produced his most complete performance to date with two against Burnley.

He peeled away from his marker at Morrison’s corner so was able to nod in at to the far post when Graham Dorrans got the flick on for his first goal.

And then he curved his run to stay onside to receive Dorrans’ pass and strike a sweet first-time finish for his second.

‘His movement for such a young player is very good,’ said head coach Irvine. ‘He was a wee bit frustrated at half-time because he felt that he had made runs and things hadn't quite come off.

‘I just said to him, as a striker, if you are going to score goals, you are going to have to make a lot of runs for that one that actually all comes together. 

West Brom boss Alan Irvine has praised Berahino's work ethic and his desire to improve as a footballer

‘Fortunately, he got that when it came through to him just right and his finish was great. He can finish with both feet.

‘He's a great professional. I know people have talked about problems in the past, I haven't seen a moment of that. He's been a pleasure to work with, he's got a great future.

‘Saido works on his game every single day, he stays to do finishing and movement after training has finished and he's getting his rewards for that.’

Berahino scored the winner on his England Under-21 debut against Moldova in September 2013

On September 28, 2013, Berahino struck the goal that condemned Manchester United to a shock defeat, just 23 days after marking his England Under 21 debut with the winner against Moldova.

Steve Clarke had brought Berahino into the first-team but was dismissed less than two months later and that affected him. ‘I kind of lost myself,’ Berahino revealed last week.

His form stuttered under caretaker Keith Downing and Spaniard Pepe Mel, who played him to varying degrees, although he did finish the club’s top scorer with nine goals in all competitions.

Irvine seems to have helped re-energise Berahino, who arrived in Birmingham aged 10 as a refugee having fled Burundi during the civil war that claimed the life of his father.

He has overcome that hardship but it shapes who he is, and explains the drive he brings to his profession.

England coaches Ray Lewington and Gary Neville were in the stands at The Hawthorns to witness his destruction of Burnley and Roy Hodgson knows the player from his time at West Brom.

With Daniel Sturridge still to recover from injury and Rickie Lambert yet to find the net for Liverpool, there is potential for Berahino to receive senior honours quicker than expected.

There are two European qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia in the coming fortnight and time could be opportune to test his mettle. He is the leading English scorer in the Premier League so far.

‘That will certainly make Roy think,’ smiled Irvine.
