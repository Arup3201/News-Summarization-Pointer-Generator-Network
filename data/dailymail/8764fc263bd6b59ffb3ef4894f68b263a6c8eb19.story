Have you ever wished there was a quicker and easier way to slice up fruit and make a healthy salad or feed hungry youngsters?

If you have, one YouTube user has uploaded a video that he says is a 'quick kitchen tip that will change the way that you cut grapes, cherry tomatoes and grape tomatoes forever'.

The short video, which lasts for just over one and a half minutes, features 'Papa Natural' as he demonstrates his  innovative method of cutting up fruit quickly and efficiently.

Papa Natural places a second plate down on top of the cherry tomatoes and sandwiches the fruit in between

The American says instead of cutting up fruit 'one by one' on a cutting board, which is time consuming and 'increases the risk of cutting your fingers,' viewers should try his novel method.

Papa Natural begins by taking two identical plates and a knife. He turns the first plate upside down with the bottom facing upwards. 

Then he places about a dozen grapes or tomatoes on the bottom of the plate and he puts the second plate down on top, sandwiching the fruit.

First the US man puts the tomatoes which he intends to slice on the back of his first plate

The man then points to the gap between the two plates and pushes down on the upper plate as he takes his knife and cuts through them.

Papa Natural says there are a number of benefits to cutting a bunch of tomatoes or grapes in half. 

He adds: 'Now why would you want to cut a bunch of tomatoes or grapes in half? 

'Well it's perfect for when you have babies and you don't want to feed them the whole thing and it's also great when you're making a salad.'
