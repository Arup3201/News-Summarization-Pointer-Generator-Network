One of the jurors who overturned Amanda Knox's murder conviction has said he was never convinced by the 'conjecture' of the prosecution's case and that he believed the US student and her co-defendant simply did not kill her British roommate.

Mauro Chialli was one of eight jurors who on Monday ordered Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito be freed after acquitting them of charges that they sexually assaulted and murdered Meredith Kercher in 2007.

Knox returned home to Seattle on Tuesday, and Sollecito to his home in southern Italy.

Innocent: Mauro Chialli said he was determined Amanda Knox, left, and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, right, were telling the truth during the trial

In an interview with Italy's state-run RAI television, Mr Chialli said he had spent a lot of time during the 10-month appeals trial reading the faces of Knox and Sollecito and determined they were telling the truth in insisting on their innocence.

'I saw the faces of these two kids, and they couldn't bluff. They didn't bluff. My point of view is that these kids weren't guilty. They weren't there,' he said.

Knox and Sollecito were arrested a few days after Miss Kercher's body was discovered in a pool of blood on November 2 2007 in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia.

Jailed: Rudy Hermann Guede was convicted in 2009 of Meredith Kercher's murder and had his 16-year prison sentence upheld by Italy's highest court

They were convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively. A third defendant, Rudy Hermann Guede, was also convicted and had his 16-year prison sentence upheld by Italy's highest court.

Following Monday's acquittals, Guede 
remains the only one in prison for the death. His lawyer has said he 
wants the case reopened, given that Italy's high court determined Guede 
did not act alone.

Mr 
Chialli said there were several elements of the prosecution's case that 
did not convince him, primarily the lack of a motive and uncertainties 
about the precise time of Miss Kercher's death.

'What
didn't convince me was that in the end, it was an accusation based on 
so many conjectures,' he said. 'It could have been this way, it could 
have been another way.'

Knox and Sollecito maintain they were at Sollecito's apartment the night of the killing, smoking hashish, watching a film and having sex.

Earlier in the week, the Italian judge who presided over the appeal, Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, said the two were cleared of murder based on the evidence but that the real truth could be different.
