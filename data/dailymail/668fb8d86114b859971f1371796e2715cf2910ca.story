A police officer has died after crashing his quad bike into a frozen lake in Sweden.

The officer reportedly put the bike into the wrong gear and reversed into a barrier by the quayside at Riddarfjärden lake near the centre of the capital Stockholm.

His momentum took him over the edge and into the frozen ice with the four-wheel drive vehicle falling on top of him.

The officer was rescued from the lake but died last night from his injuries in hospital

Another officer, together with several ice skaters who were on the lake at the time, was able to rescue the man from the water as a rescue team rushed to the scene.

Paramedics performed CPR and took the policeman taken to Solna's Karolinska hospital in Stockholm with serious injuries, but he died last night at around 8pm.

'Our colleague unfortunately died,' Lars Byström of the Stockholm police told the TT news agency.

'It will be up to the investigation to determine how and why it happened.'

There were several witnesses in the area when the incident occurred in the early afternoon on Monday.

'I saw it, it was surreal,' Fredrik Braconier told the Expressen newspaper.

'It was the kind of thing you see in a movie, not in Kungsholms torg.'

The policeman was working together with other officers as part of a 
heightened security effort in conjunction with the state visit of 
Turkey's President Abdullah Gül, who is in Sweden for three days.

Police have launched an investigation.

'We have talked to witnesses and taken information from them. We have 
photographed the area and tried to capture what happened,' Byström 
added.
