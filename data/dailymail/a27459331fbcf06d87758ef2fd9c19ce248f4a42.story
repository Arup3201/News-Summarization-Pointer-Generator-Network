A boy took a leap of faith as he 'tombstoned' off a high cliff at Plymouth Hoe in the sunny weather on Friday.

In front of a group of friends clad in wetsuits, the teenager risked his life by jumping into the water from the sea wall, but landed safely in the sea.

The craze involves jumping off high sea walls, bridges or cliffs, sometimes up to 65-70ft high, into the water, and has recently seen several fatal accidents.

Tombstoning as a pastime has occurred 
around the coast for generations, according to the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents.

However,
in recent years, an increasing number of accidents where cliff jumpers 
have been seriously injured and in some cases died.

Tombstoning,
named so as the jumper attempts to enter the water upright - like a 
tombstone - carries many risks, not just because of the high-impact on 
the body as it lands in the water

Strong currents can prevent the jumper from resurfacing and there is also a high risk of landing on submerged rocks.

A majority of jumpers involved in accidents are male teenagers, according to ROSPA.

Thanks
to social media and video sharing sites such as Vine and YouTube, 
tombstoning communities has formed with teens trying to out-do each 
other by performing dangerous stunts such as back-flips or somersaults.

In
the past eight years, this perilous pursuit has claimed the lives of 20
people and left more than 60 seriously injured, according to the 
Maritime and Coastguard Agency.

These
figures include two suspected tombstoning incidents last months, where 
Darrell Teal, 22, died after jumping into the River Lune from the 
40ft-high Devilâ€™s Bridge at Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria.

A
few days later 15-year-old Daniel McCullagh drowned after he was swept 
away by strong currents as him as his friends tombstoned off a 20ft-high
bridge over the River Nene at Woodford Lock near Kettering, 
Northamptonshire.

Today's Plymouth tombstoners may have been risking their lives, but they cannot be blamed for not making the most of the sunny weather, which is not expected to last the weekend.

Saturday is expected to be a wet and windy day across Britain, particularly in the north-west. East Anglia and south-east England will start off bright and dry but gradually turn cloudier with patchy rain arriving at times during the day.

Elsewhere in the UK, it will be wet and windy start with outbreaks of rain slowly edging eastwards, these turning particularly heavy across Scotland, Wales and western parts of England.

The evening will see rain in the south-east England, north-west Scotland and around windward coasts of Wales and western England.

Sunday has a brighter outlook with many areas enjoying spells of sunshine , however it will remain very breezy with a few sharp showers.

The showers will be heaviest and most frequent in the north-west, although southern England and East Anglia may see a few showers during the morning.

Monday will see winds turn lighter across most of the UK with spells of sunshine and just isolated showers. However, Scotland will remain breezy with sunshine and showers.
