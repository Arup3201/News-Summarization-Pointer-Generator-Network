England captain Wayne Rooney was presented with a golden cap from Sir Bobby Charlton to commemorate his 100th international appearance before kick-off against Slovenia at Wembley.

Rooney received the cap alongside his sons, Kai and Klay, and the Manchester United striker revealed exactly what a special moment it would be to reach three figures in England appearances earlier in the week.

'As a young boy it was always my dream to play at Wembley,' said Rooney, who made his debut at Upton Park 11 years ago against Australia in 2003.

England captain Wayne Rooney's next landmark target will be to become England's all-time record scorer. Here is where he currently stands:

1. Sir Bobby Charlton, 49 goals

2. Gary Lineker, 48 goals

3. Jimmy Greaves, 44 goals

4. Wayne Rooney, 43 goals

'So to go out there and receive the cap, in particular from Bobby Charlton, will be a special moment for me. It will be an incredible feeling.'

But while Rooney, 29, will enjoy the moment, he is already looking ahead at breaking some long standing England records, such as Peter Shilton's record cap total of 125 and Charlton's record of 49 England goals.

'They are two records that have stood for a lot of years. To be in touching distance of reaching them, which is something I hope I can do, is not something that is really in my mind at the minute,' Rooney said.

'As you get closer to them, you will start to look at them, but at the end of the day if they are going to come, then they will come.'
