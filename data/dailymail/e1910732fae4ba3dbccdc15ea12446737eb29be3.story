International Development Secretary Justine Greening said she would close down a trouble-hit scheme worth millions of pounds

The British government accidentally gave £80,000 to the disgraced Zimbabwe regime in the last two years, ministers admitted today.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening blamed ‘serious errors’ for the money going to Robert Mugabe’s government, in contravention of official UK policy.

She has ordered a project to eradicate fruit flies to be shut down and will try to claw back £42million from a troubled funding scheme.

Some of the money was directed to Zimbabwe's Ministry of Agriculture by a third party agency but was originally from British taxpayers.

In a written statement to MPs, International Development Secretary Justine Greening blamed mistakes in planning and implementation under the last Labour government when it set up the TradeMark Southern Africa (TMSA) project.

She said of a £67 million fund of UK aid money for the scheme, £42 million had never been spent and would now be reclaimed by the Treasury.

And the project would be shut down, Ms Greening added.

Outlining specific problems, Ms Greening said: ‘Weak governance also resulted in payments amounting to £80,000 via ring-fenced accounts held by the Ministry of Agriculture in Zimbabwe from 2011.

‘Although our investigations show this money was used appropriately and as intended for a fruit fly eradication project to promote trade and reduce poverty, this payment was in contravention of UK Government policy.’

The problems have been uncovered by the Department for International Development's (DFID) own audit department and the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI).

A DFID spokesman said the £80,000 was handed to Zimbabwe's Ministry of Agriculture by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, a partner with the TMSA project, which was given money by DFID.

It is understood seven payments were made to the Ministry of Agriculture between July 2011 and May 2013.

The UK government has a policy against aid money going to the Zimbabwe government of President Robert Mugabe

The UK Government funds a direct aid programme in Zimbabwe but does not channel funds through the government infrastructure in the country as a matter of policy.

In her statement to MPs, Ms Greening said ‘serious flaws in the governance and programme management of the TMSA’ have been uncovered.

‘While we have found no evidence of fraud, these investigations have revealed a number of serious concerns including weakness in delivery, management, oversight and financial monitoring,’ she said.

Ms Greening said the whole point of ICAI was to identify problems and ensure they were dealt with.

And she pledged to MPs: ‘I am fully prepared to stop funding to programmes that do not offer value for money or that fail to achieve their objectives.

‘I have given notice to commence shutting down TMSA with immediate effect.

‘In parallel, DFID is exploring alternative, more effective mechanisms to support the important steps being taken in the region to drive trade and regional integration.’

Internal audits at DFID will be strengthened, Ms Greening said, to enhance a ‘risk-based approach’.
