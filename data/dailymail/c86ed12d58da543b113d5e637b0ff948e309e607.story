The Central Conference of American Rabbis, the rabbinical branch of Reform Judaism, has installed its first openly lesbian president.

Denise Eger, 55, was inaugurated Monday at the CCAR's annual convention  in Philadelphia this year, Jewish Telegraph Agency reports. 

Though Eger isn't the first openly gay or lesbian clergy person to lead an American rabbinic group, the road for Eger has not been an easy one.

First: Denise Eger, 55, was inaugurated Monday as the first openly lesbian president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis

Eger was ordained in 1988, a time when one could not be an openly gay Reform rabbi, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. 

Though Eger wasn't formally out at that time, her sexual preference was known and no one would hire her, according to Yahoo News. 

Later, Eger was offered a job with Beth Chayim Chadashim, the world's first lesbian and gay synagogue.

Two years after her ordination, Eger formally came out as a lesbian in a Los Angeles Times story, Yahoo reports, saying that gay and lesbian Jews need a positive role model.

'I took a great risk but I didn't feel I could be authentic anymore — watching young men all around me die and not tell,' she told the paper.

Eger has since served pulpits in Canada, Los Angeles, and New York. She has been vocal and active in LGBT community, becoming a noted speaker and award-winning activist in the community.

Hire: Eger was ordained in 1988, and though she wasn't formally out at that time, her sexual preference was known and no one would hire her

She is the founding rabbi of Kol Ami synagogue in Los Angeles, Calif. 

Eger has been on the CCAR board of trustees for four years, JTA reports, becoming president elect in 2013.

The 55-year-old was both the first female and the first openly gay president of the Southern California Board of Rabbis. 

Speech: Here, Eger speaks at the CCAR's annual convention, held this year in Philadelphia, where she was inaugurated

Hopes: Though Eger once believed becoming a rabbi or cantor would force her to sacrifice her hopes of having a spouse and children, she is currently engaged and has a 21-year-old son

Though Eger once believed becoming a rabbi or cantor would force her to sacrifice her hopes of having a spouse and children, she is currently engaged and has a 21-year-old son. 

'It's about human rights and human dignity,' Eger told Yahoo. 

'If you can be a rabbi, if you can be a person of faith, if you can serve a community as their pastor, and you can have the opportunity to begin to reconcile all of those issues, it speaks volumes.'
