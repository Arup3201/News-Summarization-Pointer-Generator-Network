Liverpool's Under 18 side safely booked their place in their fourth round of the FA Youth Cup after two early goals were enough to hand them victory against Bradford City on Monday night.

While the senior side wasted a host of opportunities to score against Manchester United on Sunday, the youngsters showed a far more clinical side to their game at Langtree Park - taking the lead inside just two minutes.

Reds forward Jerome Sinclair forced visiting keeper Elliot Barker into making an error, allowing Sheyi Ojo to pick up the loose ball before unselfishly cutting it back to Sergi Canos inside the area, who slid the ball home into an empty net.

Things got even better for the hosts just two minutes later as Ojo was again the provider, sending Sinclair clear with a superb through ball, with the pacy forward finishing with aplomb as he arrowed the ball into the near corner.

The hosts continued to dominant and in truth the margin could have been far greater come the full-time whistle.

Next up for the Reds is a home tie with Derby County as they look to banish the memories of their penalty shoot-out defeat to Reading in the quarter-finals of the competition in March, as they look to go all the way this time around.
