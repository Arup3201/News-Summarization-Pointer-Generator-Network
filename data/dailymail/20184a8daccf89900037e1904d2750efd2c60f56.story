Barclays Bank has dealt a blow to Boris Johnson by pulling out of its £50million sponsorship of London’s bicycles-for-hire scheme.

It had been hoped that the deal, which began in 2010, would continue until at least 2018, but Barclays has apparently told the Mayor that its sponsorship will end in 2015.

The scheme, strongly supported by Mr Johnson, allows people to hire so-called ‘Boris bikes’ from ranks dotted across  the capital and then deposit them at  their destination.

Transport for London, which runs the bike scheme on the Mayor’s behalf, will now have to begin the search for a new sponsor to step in from 2015.

A spokesman for Barclays said the decision was the result of a long-term analysis of the sponsorship agreement and had nothing to do with the spate of tragedies last month when six cyclists died in 13 days on London’s roads.

In August this year 20-year-old French woman Philippine Degerin-Ricard became the first person to be killed riding a ‘Boris bike’ after she was struck by a lorry on Whitechapel High Street in East London.

The bikes were launched amid much fanfare in August 2010. Around 8,000 bikes are now available from 570 docking stations.

However, several months ago Barclays began the process of a strategic review of its sponsorship programmes and has now made a commercial decision not to continue the sponsorship.

'Barclays have received immense benefits from the publicity given to the cycle hire scheme in its early years, but now that its performance is looking shaky they appear to be bailing out'

Graeme Craig, director of commercial development for TfL, said it would seek  a replacement when the current deal  comes to a close.

‘Barclays remains committed to the sponsorship agreement signed in 2010, but the bank and TfL have decided not to take up the option to extend it,’ he said.
