Kasey Caron, 17, a student at Richland High School in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, was assigned as female at birth, but identifies and presents as male

A Pennsylvania school board has denied a request from a transgender student to run for homecoming king - putting him on the ballot for homecoming queen instead.

Kasey Caron, 17, was born a girl, 
but identifies as a boy - including in his daily life in high school.

Richland, Pennsylvania, School Board solicitor Timothy Leventry says Pennsylvania law requires a person born female to have a physician certify a sex change operation and have their birth certificate changed to legally be considered male.

As a result, the Richland board refused to recognize Kasey as a boy - even though the high school senior's classmates and teachers refer to Kasey as 'him.'

The Kasey's family members said they were disappointed by the board's decision.

'My heart sunk a little,' Kasey's mother Kathy Caron said.

Kasey was born with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that leads to a hormone imbalance where the ovaries make more androgens – sometimes called male hormones – than normal and has had to field the question ‘Are you a boy or
a girl?’ throughout his childhood.

For the bulk of his four years at 
Richland High School in Johnstown, Caron's teachers and classmates have 
recognized him as male.

When
a guidance counselor suggested he enter his name for homecoming king at
the beginning of the school year, Caron thought the school was finally 
ready to accept his gender identity, reports The Johnstown 
Tribune-Democrat.

But
on the day the student body was scheduled to vote for the homecoming 
court, administrators told Caron that their legal counsel had informed 
them they were required to list Caron's name on the female ballot, 
because he is legally identified as female on his driver's license.

The school board at Richland High School agreed to discuss Caron's plight at a meeting on Monday night, but ultimately no final decision was taken

Even though Caron was listed as female on the ballot, Richland students voted him onto the homecoming court.

Recognizing
Caron's 'unique situation,' administrators told him he could attend the
homecoming parade with a date of his choice, rather than automatically 
pairing him with another male student running for homecoming king. 

While Caron was considering the school's offer, his mother, Kathy Caron, and her partner, Cindy Theys, got involved and contacted various groups to mount a defense of their son.

'There
is a legal side of this issue and there is a practical side,' school board solicitor Timothy Leventry told the Johnstown 
Tribune-Democrat after hearing from Kasey and other supporters.

Kasey Caron has the full support of his family, including his two moms, his father, his siblings, and his transgender godmother in Maryland

'The 
school board has looked at the legal side. Tonight, the practical side 
is coming forward.

'The board wants to fully look at these issues and take this matter under further advisement.'

He believes there is no 
doubt that Caron is legally female and that a physician must certify any sex change and a person's birth certificate must be changed in Pennsylvania.

Caron, who plans to clinically transition once he turns 18, said he was ‘disappointed’ that the school board didn't immediately rule on the request, but he remains hopeful.

‘I thought they were going to have a change of heart. I am still hoping for one,’ he said

Caron's family, including his two moms, his father, his siblings, and his transgender godmother in Maryland, are standing behind him.
