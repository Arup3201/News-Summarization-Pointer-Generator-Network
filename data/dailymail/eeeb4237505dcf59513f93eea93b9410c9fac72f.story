Londoners were in for a surprise this morning when Doctor Who daleks invaded Westminster Bridge. 

The sci-fi cyborgs were in the capital for business, rather than pleasure, as BBC crews filmed scenes for a one-off special to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who.

The programme, called An Adventure in Time And Space, is a dramatisation of the how the cult series was created.

Filming for the drama, which is set in the 1960s, began earlier this month. It will air later this year on BBC2.

Today's filming sought to recreate scenes from the second episode of series two of Doctor Who, entitled The Dalek Invasion of Earth, filmed in 1964 where the daleks stormed through London.

Photos of the episode's ‘invasion’ became instantly popular in 1964 and over 
the years images of those scenes have been referenced and updated 
on several occasions.

Today's filming was the first time that a 
production team had attempted to faithfully replicate the 1964 shoot 
using Daleks that were unique to that single adventure.

The forthcoming drama based on Doctor Who has been scripted by Mark Gatiss, who co-wrote the script for Sherlock Holmes.

It will star David Bradley as William Hartnell who was the first actor to ever play the role of the doctor.

Brian Cox will play the role of Sydney Newman, the former head of drama at the BBC who was the driving force behind the creation of the show.

Gatiss said: 'This is the story of how an unlikely set of brilliant people created a true television original.

'And how an actor – William Hartnell – stereotyped in hard-man roles became a hero to millions of children.

'I've wanted to tell this story this for more years than I can remember.
To make it happen for Doctor Who's 50th birthday is quite simply a 
dream come true.'
