A website is offering people hugs and positive messages from strangers in a bid to cheer them up.

It claims to be the ‘nicest place on the internet,’ where happy people have signed up to spread their positive thoughts and feelings to those who are feeling down.

A website claims to be the 'nicest place on the internet' and happy people have signed up to spread their positive thoughts and feelings to those who are feeling down by making short videos (a still is pictured)

Record a hug or a positive message using a video camera on a computer or smartphone.

Upload the hug to YouTube and email the site a link. This is how all positive videos are added to the website and its YouTube channel.

Alternatively, people can send the website a download link from a site like WeTransfer or YouSendIt.

In the email to the website, posters can offer some information about themselves such as their name and location.

The appropriately named site, thennicestplaceontheinter.net, lets people post videos of themselves blowing kisses, offering hugs and leaving messages to lift visitors’ spirits.

The ‘about’ section of the site reads: 'Having one of those days? Yeah, been there too.'

‘And sometimes, a little pick-me-up is hard to come by. So come on by to turn the sad into happy and the happy into a celebration. Cause this is a nice place to visit on days like today.’

One user of the site, Joseph Meehan, 27, from Birmingham, said: ¿It¿s a fun and uplifting website. I visit every once in a while when I'm missing friends or family. Here, one happy user leaves a message for strangers

Recorded video clips offering affection to strangers rotate and can be viewed by anyone logging on to the site.

Favourite and inspirational messages can be shared with friends via email or social networking sites to be viewed at a later date. 

The website was created by Jeff Lam and is credited with helping many people out when they have felt low.

The San Francisco-based art director said he came up with the idea when he and his friend Lauren were 'having one of those days'.

'None of the usual methods seemed to be 
working. Not music. Not food. Not office puppies. What we craved was 
something honest and good, unhappiness-offsetting, fail-proof and 
grin-inducing. So armed with only a tripod, camera and work-free weekend, we created The Nicest Place On The Internet,' he explained on his website.

One user of the site, Joseph Meehan, 27, from Birmingham, said: ‘It’s a fun and uplifting website. I visit every once in a while when I’m missing friends or family.

‘I think it could really be a help to people that are feeling down or upset, maybe even stop them from doing something stupid.

‘You upload your video to the website, and they add it to the stream. It’s very easy to share the love.’

Mr Lam is now working on a new project that involves people leaving positive voicemails for strangers.

The idea is that strangers collectively contribute to an entry of an audio diary by leaving a voicemail and then anyone can listen to a completed podcast.
