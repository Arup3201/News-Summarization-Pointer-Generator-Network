A £600,000 payout to the social services chief who failed to save Baby P 'leaves a bad taste in the mouth' Ed Balls said today, as he stood by the decison to sack her while he was Children's Secretary.

Sharon Shoesmith, the former head of 
children’s services at Haringey Council, was fired from her £130,000-a 
year job in 2008 in the wake of a public outcry over the death of 
17-month-old Peter Connelly.

She launched an appeal claiming 
unfair dismissal, eventually won and last night BBC’s Newsnight 
reported Haringey has agreed a huge compensation deal with her. 

Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls is under-fire for pushing for her to lose her job but his spokesman said he followed legal advice and 'Ed would do the same thing again in order to put child protection first'.

Payout: Sharon Shoesmith, the social services chief who failed to save the life of Baby P, is to receive £600,000 as part of an unfair dismissal claim, which Ed Balls said 'leaves a bad taste in the mouth'

Sources
say she will be paid more than £600,000, significantly short of the 
£1million figure it had been reported she was seeking.

'An independent report 
said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services,' Mr Balls said today.

'They
said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of 
children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth 
that the person who was leading that department and responsible ends up 
walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money.

'The payout is something that will appal people across the country. 
What it can't do is bring back a little boy who lost his life because he
was failed by Sharon Shoesmith and that department. That's the truth 
and that will never change.'

Silence: Haringey Council is refusing to disclose how much the settlement with Ms Shoesmith cost taxpayers

The package is much greater than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal.

He suggested she was entitled to a minimum of three months’ salary plus pensions contributions. Three months’ salary would have been £33,000.

Newsnight also reported that the council and Shoesmith had signed a confidentiality clause preventing disclosure of the total. One source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was ‘furious’ about the clause, believing it to be ‘indefensible’.

Haringey Council continued their silence today and said they were 'unable' to say anything aside from that a deal had been reached.

Baby Peter died in August 2007 after months of horrific abuse at the hands of his mother Tracey Connelly, 31, her sadistic paedophile boyfriend Steve Barker, 36, and his brother Jason Owen, 40.

The family had been visited by professionals including Haringey social workers and doctors 60 times.

However, a hearing at The Court of Appeal
concluded Shoesmith had been ‘unfairly scapegoated’ and that her 
dismissal in December 2008 by Ed Balls, the then Children’s Secretary 
had been ‘intrinsically unfair and unlawful’.

Furious: Michael Gove was angry at an 'indefensible' clause that meant the final payoff will not be disclosed

Lord Neuberger had suggested the Department for Education should contribute to any payout for Shoesmith by her employer Haringey Council.

His judgement said: ‘It would be entirely appropriate for Haringey to seek a voluntary contribution from the Secretary of State whose unlawful directions gave rise to the problems.’

It is understood that the department will meet a proportion of the payout, the details of which were agreed by Haringey Council in the past few days.

Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a payout since the May 2011 ruling.

Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council.

That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one.

Tracey Connelly, Barker and Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child’s death.

Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. Charlotte Leslie MP, a member of education select committee that grilled Shoesmith in 2010 said: ‘It’s very simple, you’ve got to ask what responsibility actually means when she was in her position Sharon Shoesmith got a very large salary because she was the head of an organisation which means you take responsibility.

Jailed:  Baby Peter's mother Tracey Connelly, her paedophile boyfriend Steven Barker, middle, and his brother Jason Owen, right were all jailed in 2009 for causing the child's death

‘Showing leadership means when something goes wrong underneath you take responsibility and make yourself accountable. ‘I think the thing that people are most angry about is that whistleblowers like Kim Holt who raised all this, also lose their jobs but a lady like Sharon Shoesmith walks away with a very big payoff.’

Dr Holt, 54, was forced from her job as the designated doctor for children in care at St Ann’s Hospital in Haringey, North London, in 2007, after she and three other doctors wrote to management warning that staff shortages and poor record-keeping would lead to a tragedy.

Six months later, her worst fears became reality when an inexperienced doctor who had replaced her at the clinic failed to spot that Baby Peter was the victim of serious physical abuse.
