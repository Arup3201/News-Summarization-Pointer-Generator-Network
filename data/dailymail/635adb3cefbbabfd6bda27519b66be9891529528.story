The Dartmouth College chapter of the fraternity that was depicted n the 1978 film Animal House has been suspended after a brand on the buttocks of one its members became infected. 

A sophomore pledge of Alpha Delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014, according to a tipster.

By agreeing to the branding, the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid 'more drinking-intensive pledge activities'.

The fraternity at the Hanover, New Hampshire, school was famously depicted in the 1978 film Animal House 

Dartmouth's sitting president Phil Hanlon (above) - class of 1977 - is a member of the Alpha Delta fraternity 

When the pledge went home for winter break, he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor, Gawker reported. 

He had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected. 

Medical personnel alerted the college, which is in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the school handed down a suspension. 

Dartmouth's sitting president, Phil Hanlon, is a member of Alpha Delta.

He graduated in 1977, before the release of Animal House.

The Ive League college confirmed the fraternity's suspension in an email to Gawker.

Dartmouth spokesman Justin Anderson wrote: 'Alpha Delta fraternity has been charged with violating Dartmouth's standards of conduct in connection with the reported branding of some new members of the fraternity by other members in the fall of 2014.'

The school said the frat is now facing 'disciplinary sanctions' that range from 'probation, suspension, or permanent revocation of recognition'.

This is not the first time Alpha Delta has been linked to branding. 

A 1992 Rolling Stone article reported that 'a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year'.

Alpha Delta brothers did not deny that allegation at the time. 

The pledge whose brand became infected is now a brother in the fraternity.
