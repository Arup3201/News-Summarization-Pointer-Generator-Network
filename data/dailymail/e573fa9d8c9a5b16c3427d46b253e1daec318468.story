Ninety per cent on British women admit they feel bad when they look in a mirror, new research reveals.

Furthermore one in three 
feel anxious and say they hardly ever smile back at themselves, and a fifth admit they have never been happy with their reflection.

Almost a third (30 
per cent) of UK women reveal they actively avoid looking in the mirror,
 which is almost double the global average of 17 per cent.

Despite
 this, image-conscious British women look at themselves in the mirror nearly 5 (4.8) times a
 day on average, and 45 per cent say they regularly use shop 
windows as mirrors.

In light of the shocking statistic from a global report by Dove, the brand have launched their pop-up six week Beauty Project in partnership with Selfridges.

Presenter and stylist Gemma Cairney, Daphne Selfe - the world's 
oldest supermodel at 85 years old, and All Walks Beyond The Catwalk campaigner Caryn Franklin, were pictured as they unveiled the campaign on Thursday.

Distorted mirrors in the windows of the
London department store aim to highlight and challenge women's complicated 
relationship with their own reflection, and encourage them to recognise their own beauty 
when they look in the mirror.

The partnership will also provoke a wider 
conversation about how beauty is perceived in society as a whole.

Its aim is to make beauty become a source of confidence, rather than anxiety.

Beauty, skin and haircare brand Dove have taken over two windows either 
side of the front doors of Selfridges with distorting and normal mirrors
 revolving in them.

They are also releasing a film which dramatizes the struggle that many women have when looking at their reflections. 

Entitled Mirrors, the film shows the negative reaction women often have when looking at their own reflection in contrast to the joy in young girls. 

It shows how young girls are strongly influenced by their mothers' behavior and encourages mothers to help their daughters foster a more positive sense of their own beauty.

A Dove spokesperson said: 'Women have a very complicated relationship with the mirror and we know this impacts their overall confidence and happiness. Yet women constantly look at their reflection in mirrors, shop windows and lifts to check their appearance.

'We want to encourage women to smile back when they see their reflection and we are using the iconic shop windows at Selfridges to encourage women to develop a more positive relationship with their beauty.'

The Selfridges partnership is the latest initiative from Dove as it continues to champion and celebrate a wider definition of beauty where how women look becomes a source of confidence, not anxiety. 

As part of the partnership, a series of six debates will take place exploring the changing landscape of beauty from the impact of social media on self-esteem, to airbrushing to the future of beauty in the coming decade. 

Panellists taking part in the debates include Cherry Healey, Lucy Mangan, Gemma Cairney and MP Caroline Nokes.

The Beauty Project will run from Thursday May 1 until June 12
