This is the heartwarming moment a teenager with Down's syndrome is mobbed by his teammates after scoring the winning try during a school rugby match.

Ethan Plumb, 15, had always wanted to be part of the rugby team at Ysgol Brynhyfryd school in Denbighshire, but was unable to play due to his condition not allowing him to take part in contact sports.

However, after four years of sitting on the sidelines, Ethan from Llandyrnog, finally got his chance to play for his school against opponents Bala's Ysgol y Berwyn in the final minutes of a match after it was arranged by the team captain. 

Ethan, aged 15, finally got his chance to play in the school rugby team after four years on the sidelines, after being asked to play by the team captain 

In the dying minutes of the match, Ethan was passed the ball and began his run in the game for Ysgol Brynhyfryd school

He then dives to the floor with the ball scoring the winning try in the match played at Denbighshire Rugby Club 

And in the dying seconds, Ethan scored the winning try prompting him to be mobbed by his teammates as they crowd around to celebrate with him.

A video showing the heartwarming moment filmed at Denbighshire Rugby Club was then posted to Youtube and has now gone viral after being shared thousands of times.

The video starts by claiming to show 'just a normal school game' and 'just a normal try' before Ethan is seen catching the ball.

The schoolboy is then seen running before sliding across the pitch with the ball to score the try while being cheered on by the crowd.

And after scoring the winner, Ethan is then mobbed by his team mates who can't wait to celebrate with him.

As soon as he stands up, Ethan is congratulated by a team mate, as the crowd cheers on from the sidelines 

Eventually the teenager is mobbed by the other players who can't wait to celebrate his winning try with him

A message then appears from Huw Tomos-Griffiths, head of Year 11 at the school, who says: 'I’m pleased to announce that the rugby team won their game last night, with Ethan making an appearance in both halves and scoring the winning try in the last moments of the game.

'It was a magical moment for Ethan, his family and all the staff who came to support him and the team.

'A special mention must go to Ethan’s teammates who looked after him, encouraged him, and even made efforts to help him with his maths by asking him to assist with the numbers on the back of the shirts before the game.

'I don’t think I’ve ever been prouder of being a teacher at Ysgol Brynhyfryd than I was last night.

'We have some truly special students at our school.'

The video then ends with the team's captain, Dyfan Humphreys adding: 'I thought it was a great chance to do something that would hopefully mean a lot to him. Everyone that was there could tell it was a special moment.

On the video uploaded to Youtube, an email sent by head of year Huw Griffiths announces that Ethan has scored 

Mr Griffiths then goes on to praise the team and said he had never been prouder of the school 

'He’s a good lad and he deserved his moment.'

The video has now caught the attention of the rugby world with former Wales captain Ryan Jones tweeting: 'Absolutely magical - well done everyone at #YsgolBrynhyfryd. WELL DONE ETHAN #mustwatch'

Mr Tomos-Griffiths explained: 'It’s been seen in places including Mexico, Australia, Transylvania, Ireland and Taiwan,” he said.

'We had a novelist from South Africa get in touch who had just written a book about a boy who plays rugby.

'After seeing the video, he decided to dedicate his book to Ethan and to the school, and it’s now gone to the printer.

'Ethan deserves it. He had been asking Dyfan, the captain of the rugby team, if he could be in the team.

'It was unbelievable. Lots of the staff and his family were there, and the reaction of the pupils showed how much it meant to them.

A video showing Ethan's heartwarming moment filmed at Denbighshire Rugby Club was then posted to Youtube and has been viewed thousands of times 

'Everyone at the school thinks a lot of him. After the staff showed the video to their registration classes, Ethan’s been getting lots of pats on the back from other pupils.

'I’ve told him he’ll need an agent now, and I’ve asked if I can have the job!'

While Gwyneth Day, head of PE at added: 'The best part of this whole experience for Ethan is that it evolved from an idea by one of the Year 11 boys, who wanted him to be part of the team.

'Playing in a competitive sporting environment allowed not only Ethan but his teammates and opponents to develop the core values of teamwork and respect while having fun, which reflects what education should be about.

'Thanks must also go to Ysgol Y Berwyn, who made this event possible.'
