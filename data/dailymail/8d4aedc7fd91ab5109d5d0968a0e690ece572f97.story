West Germany lost to England (pictured) in the 1966 World Cup final. A report has suggested some of the German players may have been doped

West Germany's footballers who played in the 1966 World Cup Final against England may have been injected with drugs as part of a government-funded doping scheme, a study has suggested.

A report by German researchers claims that West Germany's athletes were systematically doped with government backing during the 1970s, and possibly as early as the 1950s.

Leaked extracts from the unpublished 800-page report titled 'Doping in Germany from 1950 to today' were published by German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Saturday.

According to the report, one unnamed interior minister said at the time: 'Our athletes should have the same conditions and services as the Eastern Bloc athletes.'

Researchers said West German doping did 
not evolve as a response to East Germany's systematic doping under the 
Communist government, but operated parallel to it.

The report claimed that for many years the 
state financed experiments with performance-enhancing substances such as
anabolic steroids, testosterone, oestrogen or the blood-doping agent 
EPO. It did not say when the experiments ended.

It stated that an unspecified 
number of footballers in the 1954 World Cup-winning team received 
'Vitamin C' injections, which were actually the methamphetamine Pervitin - commonly known as 
speed.

Amphetamines were used by German 
soldiers during World War II and their continued use in German football 
from the end of the 1940s became 'normal', according to the study.

As well as researchers finding alleged evidence of drugs being used by the 1954 World Cup team, they also said 'traces' of the banned stimulant ephedrine was found in three unnamed German 
players at the 1966 World Cup.

But it was claimed the drug could have accidentally been taken when players used a decongestant for colds.

Three West German players were found to have traces of the banned stimulant ephedrine in tests after the 1966 final. (There is no suggestion that any players pictured knew about or were involved in doping)

England beat West Germany 4-2 in the final at Wembley Stadium in 1966

England beat West Germany 4-2 in the final, with Geoff Hurst scoring England's disputed third goal.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung also said that 
German athletes received around 1,200 injections of Berolase and 
thioctacid at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.

The substances were not banned at the 
time and were supposed to improve performance, but their effects had been
untested.

Women and children were also doped with anabolic steroids, despite concerns over their long-term effects, the report said.

A Dr Joseph Keul of Freiburg, who died in 2000, allegedly tested the effects of anabolic steroids on boys as young as 11.

The report was put together by researchers at Berlin's Humboldt University on behalf of the German Olympic Sports Confederation, with Giselher Spitzer as the project leader.

It was completed in April, but has yet to be published because of privacy concerns and legal issues over naming athletes, doctors and politicians.Â 

West Germany's World Cup-winning 1954 team were injected with 'Vitamin C' which was actually speed, the report claimed. (There is no suggestion that any players pictured knew about or were involved in doping)

The report claimed the conditions for
'systemic doping' were laid in 1970 when the Federal Institute of Sport
Science (BISp) was founded under jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry,
which is still responsible for sports, but that doping in Germany 
existed long before.

The
BISp provided funding for research into doping substances for years, 
with sports medicine facilities in Freiburg, Cologne and Saarbruecken 
among the main recipients, the report said.

'There's
a systemic connection between research and forbidden substances and in 
using them for athletes,' Spitzer, the project leader for the report, 
told The Associated Press. 'That's why we call it systemic doping.'

The Interior Ministry said it has a 'great interest in completely clearing up and evaluating the doping past in both parts of Germany'.

German Athletics president Clemens Prokop called for names to be revealed, 'especially of those who are still involved in sport'.

Last Tuesday, the Main-Post and Maerkische Oderzeitung newspapers reported that the BISp funded experiments in Freiburg on the performance of anabolic steroids before the 1972 Olympic Games, citing a file from the Federal Archives in Koblenz.

Drugged: Shot-putter Heidi Krieger was systematically doped from the age of 16

East Germany carried out a doping programme on its athletes for decades.

Drugs, largely anabolic steriods, were given to athletes, often without their knowledge. Trainers and coaches gave pills and injections to sportsmen and women, many of whom were told they were just vitamins.

The drugs caused fast muscle build-up and quick recovery times, leading to the country seeing huge success at the Olympic Games of the 1970s and 80s and other international events.

But the steroids had severe side-effects including causing heart problems, cancer and infertility. Around 800 athletes are believed to have developed serious problems as a result of the doping.

Shot-putter Heidi Krieger (pictured aged 21) was systematically drugged with anabolic steriods from the age of 16. She did not know she was being drugged and developed many male characteristics.

At the age of 31, the shot-putter underwent a sex change to become a man named Andreas.

Krieger had retired by the age of 24, in part because of the damage caused to his body from lifting huge weights while on steroids.
