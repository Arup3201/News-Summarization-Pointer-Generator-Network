A California mom has called upon the Girl Scouts to end their partnership with Nesquik after discovering a limited edition Girl Scouts milkshake by the Nestle offshoot contains almost 50 grams of sugar per bottle.

Monica Serratos, of Orange County, told ABC News that she was recently in the supermarket with her two young daughters - both Girl Scouts - asked for the special 'Thin Mints' flavored Nesquik drink.

The 14 Oz bottle - which also comes in a caramel coconut flavor, in keeping with the popular Girls Scouts cookie theme - prominently says the product is 'low fat'.

Serratos was just about to allow her daughters- who are first and graders - are treat, before realizing there is 48 grams of sugar in each.

That is 12 teaspoons of sugar.

Liquid sugar: There are 48 grams of sugar in each bottle of the limited edition Girls Scouts-themed Nesquik drinks. The Nestle offshoot say each bottle is recommended as two servings 

Controversial: The nutrition facts lists the total sugar as 24 grams, but is per one serving, and the bottle claims to serve two, which makes the total 48 grams of sugar

The American Heart Association recommends that children aged 4 to 8 restrict their sugar intake to three teaspoons a day.

Pre-teens and teenagers are reccomended five to eight teaspoons a day.

The Nesquik bottle says that it contains two servings.

However it is typically consumed in one.

Serratos subsequently started a petition on Change.org to convince Girl Scouts to end their partnership with Nesquik, believing they should be promoting healthy habits and not sugar-filled drinks.

The petition is addressed to Anna Maria Chavez, the CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA.

'I’m demanding that Girl Scouts of America end its ties to Nestlé, stop the product sales of this liquid sugar and stop marketing unhealthy diet options to our children,' Serratos wrote in the petition.

The Girl Scouts have not responded to the petition.

However Nesquik released a statement to ABC saying the drink is marketed towards adults.

'Nesquik has a limited licensing partnership with Girl Scouts USA,' the statement said.

'It borrows the fun and flavor equity of Girl Scout cookies and applies it to a 14 oz. ready-to-drink package made with the adult consumer in mind.'

But Serratos hit back at that explanation.

'It's not being marketed toward adults,' she said.

'We're not interested in this little brown bunny on the bottle.'

More than 6,700 people had signed her petition as of Thursday.

Childhood obesity has more than doubled in the last 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

One in three children and adolescents are now overweight or obese, ABC News reported.
