The British girl left for dead after the French Alps massacre only saw one ‘bad man’, police said yesterday.

Zainab Al-Hilli, seven, returned to the UK yesterday, eight days after she was shot in the shoulder and beaten around the head.

Last night a source close to the investigation said: ‘She told us there was only one killer, who she called a bad man.’

Recovery: Zainab Al-Hilli, 7, whose parents and grandmother were murdered in their car is to stay in a secret location near London

This is likely to mean that he reloaded at least once as he carried out the terrible bloodbath.

Doctors who treated her in Grenoble said she suffered brain injuries and could lose sight in one eye.

However  they have been surprised by the speed of her recovery and allowed her to leave hospital with two relatives and British police officers at 8am yesterday.

The news comes as it was revealed 
that police are looking for for a black Mitsubishi Pajero with British 
number plates in relation to shooting.

The car is believed to have been seen in the area around Lake Annecy where the killings took place.

'It's crucial that we find this car,' said a prosecuting source. It was also revealed that the driver of the Mitsubishi ‘had dark complexion and looked nervous’.

Zainab Al-Hilli, seven, was considered well enough to travel back to the UK and the party left with 
Zainab due to be cared for at a secret location. 

She
 was orphaned in the horrific attack which saw her father Saad Al-Hilli,
 50, killed alongside his wife Ikbal, 47, and his mother-in-law Suhaila 
Al-Allaf, 74, as they sat in a BMW close to Lake Annecy, eastern France.

Zainab was found 
staggering around outside the car by Brett Martin, a former RAF man who 
cycled towards the bloodbath by chance on September 5th.

She had been pistol-whipped around the
 head, suffering multiple facial injuries that caused two subdural 
hematomas and a fractured orbital bone.

A subdural hematoma is a traumatic brain injury which can be life threatening, while the orbital bone surrounds the eyes.

Doctors at the University Hospital in Grenoble, where Zainab was 
originally put in an induced coma to help her recover, today gave her 
the ‘green light’ to go home.

‘It
 was considered beneficial that Zainab returns to a familiar place,’ 
said an investigating source. ‘She left for the UK shortly after 8am’.

Zainab’s injuries were not only further evidence of the cruelty shown by the criminal responsible, but suggest that Zaibad will have very little to offer detectives when she eventually gives an official witness statement.

‘She was beaten around the face with great force, and then shot in the shoulder – the trauma was immense,’ said another source. ‘She’s already indicated that she remembers very little about any of it.’

Police know Zainab was outside the BMW car in which her three relatives were killed, and in which her sister Zeena, four, hid.

Zeena saw nothing, and will not be an official witness in the enquiry having escaped unscathed, but Zainab’s testimony remains crucial.

It was filmed inside her hospital room, but there were no direct questions – everything was left open-ended and general.

This was to stimulate the memory of a little girl whose life was shattered. Police said they have learnt ‘some information’ from Zainab, but British police also intend to speak to her.

There are still fears, however, that whoever was responsible for the crime may want to harm both surviving girls – hence the on-going need for security around them.

French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old father of three, also died in the massacre.
