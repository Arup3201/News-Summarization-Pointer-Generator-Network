About two dozen Marines were injured during an inhalation training exercise at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine, Palms California today.

A fire extinguisher went off inside an amphibious landing vehicle during training injuring 22 marines, said officials at the base.

NBC reports that no other details were immediately available but a San Bernadino County fire spokesperson said that the base didn't need any help from the county.

There have been no deaths and most of the injuries were caused by inhalation of a substance during a training exercise, say officials from the base.

NBC reports that assault amphibious vehicles are used by Marines to transport equipment from assault ships during amphibious missions.

The Marine Combat Center is their biggest training installation where Marines participate in intense fire drills deep in the Mojave Desert. 

Those injured are receiving care at local medical facilities and are currently in stable condition, officials said.

The base is located about 170 miles east of Los Angeles.
