Congressional Republicans, led by House Oversight Committee chair Darrell Issa,are planning another IRS coal-raking exercise for Wednesday, hauling the tax agency's commissioner in for a hearing about the nearly year-old tea party targeting scandal.

Committee staff say the U.S. Department of Justice and the rest of the Obama administration haven't shown them any sign that they're investigating corruption in the awarding of income tax exemptions to nonprofit groups.

An aide to one Republican committee member said Monday that the White House and the Treasury Department were already dangerously close to causing a constitutional crisis.

'They've blown off the subpoenas,' the aide said, referring to legal demands the committee issued to the IRS on August 2 and February 14. 'If the DOJ keeps dragging its heels too, and can just get away with it, why do we have an oversight committee in the first place? It's like the White House has never heard of the separation of powers.'

John Koskinen, a former CEO of Freddie Mac, is now in charge of the IRS and will face aggressive questions on Wednesday about a scheme to target right-wing groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for special tax benefits

Hundreds of small and politically conservative tea party groups were 'screwed'  by the IRS, according to House Oversight Committee chair Darrell Issa, a California Republican

'Not even a smidgen of corruption': President Barack Obama told Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly on Super Bowl Sunday that the IRS's hands were clean, despite an ongoing investigation of the kind that the White House routinely refuses to comment on

The House of Representatives, controlled by the GOP, has already found Attorney General Eric Holder in criminal contempt for refusing to hand over documents in the botched 'Operation Fast and Furious' gun trafficking scheme.

But Holder himself is the official responsible for enforcing the contempt finding, rendering him essentially outside the reach of Congress.

And despite the White House's assurance that the Justice Department is investigating the most politically fraught IRS scandal since the Nixon administration, President Barack Obama said during a Super Bowl Sunday interview that he was already sure there was 'not even a smidgen of corruption' to be found – suggesting that he isn't reserving judgment until an investigation has concluded.

In June 2013, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that the president thought political targeting by IRS officials was 'a problem.'

Issa, a California Republican, is calling IRS top dog John Koskinen to testify Wednesday about what his agency has done to clean house.

Beginning in early 2010, IRS officials routinely held up tax-exempt applications from conservative organizations, including 'tea party'-named groups, whose positions differed from the president's. Some groups waited more than three years for their approvals, while politically liberal groups were fast-tracked.

Foot-dragging? Attorney General Eric Holder has promised to investigate the IRS's actions, but Oversight Committee Republicans say the Justice Department won't show any evidence it's actually happening

Obama sacked the then-acting commissioner, Steven Miller, promising in the White House East Room that 'we will work with Congress as it performs its oversight role. And our administration has to make sure that we are working hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.'

'Congress, Democrats and Republicans, owe
 it to the American people to treat that authority with the 
responsibility it deserves,' he insisted, 'and in a way that doesn’t 
smack of politics or partisan agendas. ... The good news is it’s 
fixable, and it’s in everyone’s best interest to work together to fix 
it.'

The scandal has galvanized disparate parts of the Republican Party, with libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul and others firing up more traditionally conservative constituencies with red-meat, anti-IRS messages

Obama nominated Koskinen to take the place of Daniel Werfel, another interim commissioner, in August. He was confirmed during the week before Christmas.

'We all hoped the new commissioner would be independent and at least make a move to toss out some of the bad apples,' MailOnline's source said. 'But this is looking like more of the same. The committee is doing all it can, but if these guys refuse to obey the law there's not much anyone can do.'

The IRS's complicity in the scandal that hamstrung hundreds of small tea party-affiliated groups exploded in May 2013 when Lois Lerner, then in charge of the agency's 'Exempt Organizations' division, answered a self-planted question about it during a professional conference.

Since then, she has refused twice to answer questions before the Oversight Committee, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

The IRS promised nearly three weeks ago that it will turn over all of Lerner's emails during the Obama administration to the House Ways and Means Committee – the Oversight Committee expects to share in the bounty of disclosures – but no documents have shown up on Capitol Hill.

Issa and other Republican committee 
leaders released a report this month alleging that Lerner 'believed the 
political participation of tax-exempt organizations harmed Democratic 
candidates, she believed something needed to be done, and she directed 
action from her unit at the IRS.'

She
 was also involved, they wrote, 'in an "off-plan" effort to write new 
regulations in a manner that intentionally sought to undermine an 
existing framework for transparency,' and then 'engaged in efforts to 
cover it up' by publicly denying that the IRS was trying to change its 
evaluation criteria.

Still a target: Lois Lerner, who helmed the IRS's tax-exempt application office while right-wing groups were singled out for special scrutiny and held back for years at a time, has refused twice to answer questions before Congress

The net effect of the proposed new regulations – an effort described in IRS emails as being developed 'off-plan' and away from public view – would be to codify the procedures that Lerner put into place, in a way that Republican congressional insiders say will permanently make it harder for conservatives to participate in the political process.

'Instead of fixing a clear form of discrimination, they're trying to write it into stone,' a second Republican aide said Monday. 'That's why so many people have complained about it.'

More than 143,000 comments were logged in response to the IRS's regulatory proposal, a historic number that's second only to the Obama administration's requirement under the Affordable Care Act that all qualifying insurance plans must include coverage for contraceptives.

Committee staff said Monday on background that the IRS has failed to turn over any requested documents about the proposed regulation.

'You watch on Wednesday,' the second staffer 
predicted: 'Koskinen is going to bob and weave, and committee 
Dem[ocrat]s are going to try and change the subject over and over 
again.'

'This is probably going nowhere, again. Unless the chairman has some new ammunition. I don't know that he does.'
