Former Manchester United midfielder David Beckham has claimed Sir Alex Ferguson forced him to shave off his mohawk shortly before competing at Wembley Stadium.

Beckham, who famously changed his hairstyle on numerous occasions during his prestigious career, has admitted the fiery Scotsman made him cut his hair in the dressing room ahead of a match at Wembley Stadium. 

However Beckham may have got his dates or the venue wrong as Beckham had a shaved head just two days before his side's Charity Shield match against Chelsea during the 2000-2001 season.

His only other final appearance during that time period came against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium as Wembley was in the process of being rebuilt.

The then Manchester United ace initially refused to adhere to Ferguson's request but then changed his mind after Ferguson's 'strict' request.

Speaking on the Graham Norton Show, which will be screened on BBC One on February 27, Beckham said: 'I was in the dressing room with an hour to go before kick off when Sir Alex Ferguson saw it and made me shave it off.

'I said no at first and then I saw his face change very quickly so I went and shaved it off in the toilet. He was very strict.

Beckham has admitted his cornbraids, which he had in 2003, were a 'bad decision'

'It was the reputation of the club, he wanted all the players to look professional and he felt it wasn't the right look. We were playing at Wembley too, so he kind of had a point!

'Some of them have been really bad – I hadn't thought them through.

'The topknot wasn't too bad but the cornbraids were a bad decision. It was bad timing as well as I was going to South Africa at the time with England and ended up meeting Nelson Mandela so that's why I regret that one.'

Beckham also played down reports suggesting he no longer sees eye-to-eye with Ferguson by insisting 'we get on'.

'We get on,' added Beckham. 'It was made worse than it actually was. He was a father figure for me for so many years.

'He brought me to the club that I loved as a kid and I was successful at the club, so he gave me everything in my career.

'He will always be a man that I look up to because he gave me the dream of playing for Man United.

'The was no olive branch. We just bumped into each other at certain occasions after I left Manchester United.

'We never discussed the falling out. There were things that upset me and there were definitely things that upset him about me, but I have so much respect for him as a manager and as a man and he gave me my dream.'
