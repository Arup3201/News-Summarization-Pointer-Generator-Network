A high-profile New York jewelry designer whose uncle founded the French fashion house Givenchy has been arrested for punching a police office in the face.

Taffin jewelry boss James de Givenchy, 50, allegedly assaulted the NYPD cop after refusing to get out of his black Mercedes SUV, which was sitting on the back of a tow truck.

The altercation happened outside the Valbella Italian restaurant at 421 W. 13th St. in Manhattan's Meatpacking district about 2 a.m. Saturday.

Police said the former creative director for Sotheby's Diamonds had parked his car illegally, and when he returned to the vehicle an NYPD traffic officer was towing it.

The angry designer then allegedly climbed onto the back of the tow truck and got into his Mercedes, stubbornly refusing to get out.

The sergeant from the Sixth Precinct was then forced to pull him out of the car, police said.

Givenchy then assumed a 'fighting stance' on the sidewalk, and the sergeant fired a taser at him but missed. That's when he punched the sergeant in the face, police said.

A second officer came to help the sergeant, and the pair sprayed Mace at de Givenchy before finally calming him down enough to arrest him, DNAInfo reported.
