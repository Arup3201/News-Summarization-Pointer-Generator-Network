The grieving parents of a 19-year-old Idaho woman who died serving her country thousands of miles from home say the US Air Force won’t give them information about the circumstances of her death.

Airman 1st Class Kelsey Sue Anderson died June 9, 2011, at Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific Ocean 3,300 miles west of Hawaii. The military has reported she committed suicide.

But Chris and Adelia Sue Anderson, her parents, filed a lawsuit last month in U.S. District Court to force the Air Force to respond to their Freedom of Information Act request seeking more information about how their daughter died.

The parents of Kelsey Sue Anderson (pictured here), 19, who reportedly committed suicide while serving on an Air Force base in Guam, contest that she was not depressed in the days leading up to her death are have filed a suit for more information

The Andersons say their daughter, an avid soccer player and horseback rider who worked in her hometown’s flower shop before joining the military, was unhappy with her job as a security guard on Guam but neither distraught nor depressed in their final contacts days before her death.

The arrival of an Air Force colonel at their home, accompanied by local sheriff’s officers from Clearwater County, to relay the terrible news was a bolt from the blue, they say.

'We just want to know what happened,' said Chris Anderson, who with his wife runs a hunting outfitting business in north-central Idaho’s forests, in an interview Wednesday. 'We don’t care if it’s good or bad, we just want closure so we can get on with our lives. It’s been two years with no answers.'

According to their federal lawsuit, the US Air Force told the Andersons in May 2012 an investigation into their daughter’s death was complete.

Anderson, who the Army reports died from a self-inflicted gun wound, showed no signs of suicidal behavior in the days leading up to her death, her parents say

They expected to quickly receive a report about what happened in an aircraft maintenance hangar that housed two B-2 bombers. That’s where they’d been told their daughter’s body was found the morning of June 9 in a locked stall of a second-floor women’s bathroom, the apparent victim of a self-inflicted gunshot wound from her own service weapon.

Kelsey had been on Guam less than five months.

When no documents arrived by August, however, her parents contacted Idaho US Senator Jim Risch and filed a Freedom of Information Act request with military offices in Virginia.

Despite repeated requests Anderson's (pictured her on her down time) parents say they have been denied an official report from the Air Force disclosing the details of their daughter's death

Risch’s office received a letter from an Air Force colonel in September, saying the investigation into Anderson’s death had been closed but that it could take six months before her parents received a response.

Months passed, however, and the Andersons say they heard nothing. The Air Force didn’t respond to a formal appeal they filed in May, either, according to their complaint. Now, they say, the Air Force is violating federal law by failing to provide them with information, or tell them why it’s exempt from disclosure.

'They basically ignore us, like we don’t exist,' Chris Anderson said. 'We’re her parents. We have the right to have an answer.'

Anderson's parents say she had plans for her future and just want to know how she died so they can get closure and move on with their lives

Contacted by the Associated Press, Air Force officials said requests about the case must come from Kelsey Sue Anderson’s family.

Risch aides were unaware the matter remains unresolved and pledged to contact the Air Force again if Anderson’s parents want additional help. 'We can certainly go back in and inquire on the case,' said Brad Hoaglun, the senator’s spokesman in Boise.

Adelia Sue Anderson recalled last seeing her daughter at Christmas in 2010, two months before she shipped out to Guam. Though Guam would be 17 time zones and worlds away from Orofino, Kelsey was looking forward to its warm climate and beaches.

Anderson's (seen here in happier days) parents have filed a Federal lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act seeking information about their daughter's alleged suicide

She had a plan. After winning $72,000 in college GI Bill assistance, she told her parents she wanted to serve her country for four years and then go to college, possibly to earn a degree as a veterinarian's assistant. It was also a chance for her to write a new chapter in the family's history of military service: Her father, uncles and grandfathers had served.

'She was the first girl, between my family and the Anderson family, who ever went into the service,' Adelia Sue Anderson said. 'She wanted to put her time in, get her money for an education, and then go on with her life.'
