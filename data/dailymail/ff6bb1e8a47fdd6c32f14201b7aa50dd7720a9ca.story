The Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations could keep the UK economy in recession for three quarters of the year, Bank of England boss Sir Mervyn King has warned.

Millions of people will take two days off work for a double Bank Holiday on June 4 and 5 as Queen Elizabeth II marks 60 years on the throne.

The economy survived dropping into negative territory in the same period last year after an extra holiday for the Royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton hit output.

But Sir Mervyn King warned yesterday that this year's celebrations will knock 0.5 of a percentage point off economic output between April and May.

The decline could hinder efforts to haul Britain's fragile economy out of recession as the crisis in the Eurozone continues to dampen growth.

While Sir Mervyn said the bigger picture was one of gradual recovery in growth, the impact of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee could  prolong the double-dip recession.

Many workers are set to use the Monday and Tuesday bank holidays as the start of a whole week off, costing them just three days of annual leave.

The remarks are a blow to David Cameron, who said in his New Year message that the Jubilee and the Olympics meant 2012 ‘must be the year we go for it’.

In the same period last year, the economy fell short of expectations and grew by just 0.2 per cent. The Royal wedding hit output by 0.4 per cent but over the whole period the economy was able to recover.

Sir Mervyn said growth 'zig zag' throughout 2012 with sporting events such as the Olympics providing a much-needed boost. A massive influx of overseas visitors will see them spending millions of pounds around the country.

He said: 'Underlying quarterly output growth (in Q2) will be around something in the order of 0.5 percent stronger than the headline measure will show.    We will then see that in the Q3 data we will go back to normal and will see a bounceback in growth.   

A Bank Holiday to mark the Royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton last year hit economic output by 0.4 per cent

'Trying to work out exactly how the Olympics will affect output growth is very difficult. Our best guess is that it is likely to boost growth somewhat. Our best guess, when you look at the headline numbers, underlying growth will be around half a percentage point stronger than the headline measure in Q2.    

'In Q3 the combination of the bounceback from the Jubilee and the Olympics means that you could see growth exaggerated by slightly more than half a percentage point and then you'll get back to a weakening in Q4.'

Sir Mervyn told the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee earlier this year that the Jubilee celebrations would have a similar impact on the economy to last year’s Royal Wedding, when the recovery stalled.

‘We do expect a fall in output in the second quarter followed by a rise in the third quarter,’ he said.

'We lose an extra day’s work because of the additional bank holiday. We saw that last year and we would expect that to happen again this year.’

The Bank’s chief economist Spencer Dale said there was similar impact with last year’s Royal Wedding, when growth was reduced by around 0.4 percentage points.

The GDP forecast for the next few years suggest the economy will see slow improvement, if any

He added: 'The Jubilee will have a slightly bigger effect, in part because it’s happening in June rather than April, so the ability for companies to make up that output within the quarter will be that much less.'

The gloomy prediction came as Sir Mervyn yesterday warned the single-currency bloc was ‘tearing itself apart without any obvious solution’.

Official figures released earlier this year showed that the UK had fallen into a double-dip recession.

The economy shrank by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of 2012 following a 0.3 per cent decline in the fourth quarter of 2011.

A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction and it was the first since the credit crunch of 2009.

Alan Clarke, UK and eurozone economist at Scotiabank, said: 'The economy hasn't grown for six months, and the headline second quarter GDP data are unlikely to stray much above zero, even if the underlying picture is more robust.'

Ben Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist who sits on the Bank’s interest rate setting committee with the Governor, said the extra day off would disrupt business.

‘It is 5 per cent of working time,’ he said. ‘Maybe a little less, but it is quite a lot.’
