When sport and social media collide it has the potential to conjure up a somewhat volatile cacophony of opinion and discord all squeezed into 140 characters.

Let’s face it, there are a fair few sports men and women out there who like the sound of their own voice (not naming any names), but on the odd occasion there is that one person who brightens up your day with a perfectly executed comment.

So, with that in mind as we prepare to wistfully say a fond farewell to yet another year, Sportsmail took a look back on  rather eventful 12 months for sports personalities on social media in order to crown the ultimate king and queen of Twitter.

Mario Balotelli ruffled a few feathers when he commented on Manchester United's wobble against Leicester

2014 King of Twitter - where to begin? There were various nominees for this illustrious title but in our eyes there was only one candidate for this one.

He’s outspoken, yes, and gets into trouble for airing his sometimes ill-thought (but well-intentioned) thoughts online… and that person is Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli.

Never one to shy away from the spotlight, Balotelli recently got himself into serious trouble for an Instagram post that used an anti-Semitic tone.

Although the former Manchester City man apologised, he was consequently slapped with a £25,000 fine, a one match ban and forced to attend an education course to teach him the dos and don’ts of opening one's mouth.

The Italy striker was on the losing side for his country's World Cup group clash with Costa Rica

With the issue seemingly put to bed (until the day he inevitably puts his foot in it again), we move onto why we believe the 24-year-old Italy front man deserves such accolade. And it was summed up in two concise but hilarious tweets.

Following on from Manchester United’s embarrassing 5-3 defeat by Leicester back in September, Balotelli went on Twitter to let his fans know what he thought of Louis van Gaal’s poor start to the season.

In just three words, Balotelli took down the Premier League giants with aplomb by saying ‘Man utd… LOL’, a tweet that received over 200,000 retweets and 100,000 favourites. Not bad.

But his crowning moment came when he delivered again during last summer’s World Cup in Brazil.

Speaking ahead of Italy’s clash with surprise group leaders Costa Rica, the controversial striker set sides splitting by saying if he were to score and keep England in competition for qualification he would expect a kiss from none other than the Queen herself... Italy lost 1-0 and England were sent packing. Maybe some other time, Mario.

Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki had an emotional year following her split from golfer fiance Rory McIlroy

Wozniacki thanked her fans on Twitter s for their support, quoting Liverpool's motto to express her feelings

The former WTA Tour World No 1 and her ex-fiance and current world No 1 golfer McIlroy split in May 

So on to this year's Queen of the Tweet. With fierce competition for the top spot in this contest, we traipsed through a vast amount of tweets from sportswomen throughout 2014.

It has been a particularly roller coaster 12 months for former WTA Tour World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki, who announced her engagement to professional golfer Rory McIlroy on New Year's Day only for him to break it off five months later.

Pouring her heart out on Twitter, avid Liverpool fan Wozniacki thanked fans for their support, adding ‘Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I’ll never walk alone’.

The Danish tennis star showed she was recovering in this toung-in-cheek swipe at 5ft 7in Rory McIlroy

Not sure she’ll be as upbeat about her club following their jittery start to this season. 

But that didn't stop the 5ft 9in tennis star from hitting back at her former husband-to-be with a well-worded snipe at golfer McIlroy, who stands two inches smaller.

Tweeting a picture of herself in some killer heels, the Scandanavian boasted about being able to wear the shoes for the first time since her relationship started with McIlroy. Ouch.
