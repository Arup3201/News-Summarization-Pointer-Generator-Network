They've broken up and reunited more times than anyone can count.

And according to insiders, while Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's latest separation was hardly unexpected, with their undeniable pull to one another, it's only a matter of time before they kiss and make up once again.

So what was it this time that drove a wedge between the pair?

According to various reports doing the rounds, Justin's cosy friendship with Selena's frenemy Kendall Jenner was the catalyst, the singer and actress flipping her lid after discovering that the pair had been hanging out in secret behind her back.

'Selena was absolutely livid when she found out Justin had dinner with Kendall': Selena Gomez is said to have split with Justin Bieber after he lied to her about getting together with her frenemy, Kendall Jenner

Of course, the popstar was photographed not in the company of his girlfriend, but with up-and-coming model Kendall, enjoying a bite to eat at Ferdi in Paris, France on September 30.

Though he was in the City Of Love with his girlfriend, he reportedly told her he was having dinner with his security team and would meet up with her afterwards to attend the star-studded CR Fashion Book party together.

However, when Selena learned that her beau had blatantly lied to her face, an insider tells In Touch Weekly: 'She went crazy.'

'Selena was absolutely livid when she found out Justin had dinner with Kendall. He lied to her about it,' they continue. 'She was so angry that she changed her flight to come back to LA two days early and told him their relationship was over - again.'

Indeed, while Justin spent the evening chatting and taking photos with not only Kendall but her mom, Kris Jenner, and half-sister Kim Kardashian, as well as best pal Gigi Hadid, at the soiree, he and Selena kept their distance and weren't photographed together.

Putting on a brave face: While the actress looked a million dollars in her gorgeous red satin Dior frock at Tuesday night's LA premiere of Rudderless, inside she's quietly seething that the 18-year-old has come between her and Justin

As Us Weekly reports, the 22-year-old Come & Get It hitmaker 'doesn't trust Kendall's motives'.

While on holiday with Justin in St Martin in late September, Selena is said to have seen text messages on her boyfriend's phone from the leggy brunette suggesting that the pair hang out.

It was the same trust issues that saw Selena dump both Kendall, 18, and her 17-year-old sister Kylie as friends following their trip to the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival in April.

Reports suggest that the former Disney darling was none too happy at finding out her on-off boyfriend had hooked up with Kylie during their weekend of partying.

'She told Justin she wanted to have nothing to do with them,' an insider tells In Touch, adding: 'That meant he had to cut them off, too.'

Of course, the 20-year-old Canadian singer did no such thing, which has continued to cause plenty of tension in his relationship.

'It turns out Justin has been texting Kendall the whole time and Paris wasn't the first time they secretly had dinner together,' the source divulges.

In his element! The 20-year-old popstar spent the night chatting and taking photos not only with Kendall but her mom, Kris Jenner, and bestie Gigi Hadid, even holding court with her half-sister Kim Kardashian as he and Selena kept their distance

'She was so angry that she changed her flight to come back to LA two days early': Earlier that evening, Justin enjoyed a dinner date with Kendall at Ferdi - telling his girlfriend that he was grabbing a bite with his security team and they would meet up later

'Justin admitted it and insists they're just friends, but Selena doesn't believe him': Justin's feeble excuses didn't sit well with the 22-year-old, who got into a 'screaming match' with her beau before breaking things off, the star reportedly 'feeling completely humiliated'

'Justin admitted it and insists they're just friends, but Selena doesn't believe him, and they had a screaming match over it. She feels completely humiliated.'

Meanwhile, a source close to the Jenners reveals that Kendall is not-so-secretly loving coming between the couple.

'Kendall just loves that she got something over on Selena,' they explain. 'It's ugly behaviour.'

With Selena having packed her bags and fled home to LA on October 1 minus Justin, he seemingly wasted no time mourning the end of their relationship.

On October 2, he was seen cosying up to a mystery woman at a Paris nightclub as Selena publicly unfollowed him on Instagram and posted several telling tweets about their break-up.

'Sometimes we think we aren't good enough. But then I realize when I think I'm alone I have God,' she posted on October 1.

Not-so discreet: The pair even headed off together in a Rolls-Royce, seemingly making no attempt to keep their rendezvous secret for long

Flying solo: The star looked decidedly forlorn as she jetted out of France on October 1,  tweeting, 'Sometimes we think we aren't good enough. But then I realize when I think I'm alone I have God'

'She is completely weak when it comes to him': On October 5, the singer posted this intimate black and white shot with his ex before taking it down, with insiders saying, 'No-one would be surprised if she went back. It's like an addiction'

She also wrote, 'We have to learn the hard way sometimes,' though she swiftly deleted the comment.

While Selena is back in California, fuming over the couple's latest break-up, Justin is living it up in Europe with dad Jeremy, the pair currently vacationing in Rome.

However, according to E! Online, Selena isn't keen to wait around for him to come to his senses this time, with the star apparently considering starting afresh in New York City.

'I'd love to spend time in New York,' she told the website ahead of the Hollywood premiere of her new movie, Rudderless, on Tuesday. 'I've always said that I want to have a love affair and live there.'

And she has a cheerleader in bestie Taylor Swift, who made the move herself earlier this year and is encouraging her pal to take the plunge, too. 

The way they were: Selena attended the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival with sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner in April, the trio thick as thieves, albeit for a very brief time

The calm before the storm: According to reports, Selena ditched the siblings  after learning that Kylie had hooked up with Justin during their wild weekend of partying and expected him to do the same, though he secretly remained in contact with them both

'Taylor has been begging me to live there,' she revealed. 'She's like, "It's the best decision I've ever made." Everyone always says I'm more New York when they meet me so maybe it would be good for me. I don't spend enough time there.'

Of course, Justin is hardly going to sit back and let the love of his life leave, with those close to the star already saying that he 'wants her back'.

On October 5, he shared an intimate black and white snap of the stunning beauty kissing his shoulder tenderly as he held out his camera phone to capture the moment, before seemingly thinking better of it and taking it down.

Insiders believe the gesture could well have done the trick though, commenting that Justin 'has this amazing way of working his way back into her life'.

'She is completely weak when it comes to him,' they add. 'No-one would be surprised if she went back. It's like an addiction. She deserves better.'
