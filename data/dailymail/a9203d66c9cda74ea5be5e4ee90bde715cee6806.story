With 1,600 stores across the UK, its name has become a familiar sight on almost every High Street.

But bakery chain Greggs is poised to expand even further afield - by supplying sausage rolls to British soldiers serving abroad.

The company is to start sending frozen savoury items to a British military base in Guterslöh, Germany, in a trial designed to give troops a 'taste of home'.

Home comforts: British troops dine at a Naafi outlet at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. Sausage rolls made by bakery chain Greggs may soon be on the menu

If successful, the concept could be rolled out to serve more than 32,000 British soldiers across the globe.

Under the deal with Armed Forces caterer Naafi, Greggs will supply a range of seven frozen savoury items - including sausage rolls, steak bakes, chilli bakes and sausage and bean melts - to Guterslöh for 12 weeks.

The products will be baked throughout the day by Greggs-trained Naafi personnel and displayed on a Greggs-branded counter.

They will cost as much as they do in Britain.

Naafi's chief executive, Reg Curtis, said the deal was 'not about nutrition'.

'A soldier can eat three healthy three-course meals a day for less than €5 (£4) in the army,' he told the Times.

'This is about giving the common soldier a taste of home.'

The Guterslöh Naafi, which caters for 2,300 servicemen, was chosen for the trial because it serves 'a large number of single men', whom Mr Curtis believes will prefer the savoury goods to German foods.

Greggs claimed that its products had come top in a survey which asked armed forces personnel what items they most missed from home.

The Newcastle-based company's chief executive, Ken McKeikan, a Royal Navy veteran of the Falklands War, said he hoped the trial would pave the way to a global Naafi deal.

Naafi outlets serve 32,500 troops across Afghanistan, Brunei, Germany, Gibraltar and the Falklands.

Expansion: Bakery chain Greggs has 1,600 stores across the UK and hopes to begin serving food to 32,500 British troops worldwide

Manned by civilians, many of whom are dependants of service personnel, they offer home comforts such as British bread, British milk, British fish & chips, and British beer.

Mr McKeikan said: 'It's great to hear that Greggs was the most requested brand that troops missed from home and we are really pleased to be making our savouries accessible to our troops in Germany, and, depending on the success of the trial, more widely available for our armed forces personnel around the world.'

The trial is another triumph for Greggs, coming less than four months after it claimed victory in a battle with the Treasury over Chancellor George Osborne's planned 'pasty tax'.

Mr Osborne announced in March that hot snacks would be subject to 20 per cent VAT, but the decision was overturned in May after a much-publicised campaign led by the bakery chain.
