Striking images have revealed new insights into how the kidney develops from a group of cells into a complex organ.

In a time-lapse video, a mouse kidney is seen developing, with cells growing out like the branches of a tree.

It is hoped the images will help scientists to understand the early stages of development in mammals.

University of Edinburgh scientists took time-lapse kidney growth images. They reveal structures called nephrons branching out like a tree. These are instructed to do so by a key protein called beta-catenin. By altering the protein activity, the researchers found that they could instruct the kidney to grow differently

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute used time-lapse imaging to capture mouse kidneys growing in the laboratory on camera.

They identified a key protein called beta-catenin that instructs cells to form specialised structures within the kidney.

These structures - called nephrons - are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood to generate urine.

Yesterday it was revealed that scientists had developed a transparent eggshell that allows the growth of an embryo to be monitored in a laboratory.

While the ‘egg’ itself was artificial, the bird embryo inside is very much real - and allows the researchers a unique glimpse into how embryos develop .

The method could be used to perform test drugs and techniques on embryos grown in this way, rather than performing tests on laboratory animals.

The embryo featured in the video didn't hatch to grow into an adult bird, but scientists say their methods could allow embryos to be manipulated to understand how various biological processes work. 

Yellow areas in the video show where beta-catenin is most active, with higher concentrations instructing cells to form particular parts of the structure.

The images reveal that a gradient in the activity of beta-catenin forms along the growing nephron. It is the concentration of the molecule that instructs cells to form each particular part of the structure.

By changing the activity of beta-catenin in different places, the researchers learned that they could instruct cells to form the kidney in different ways.

If nephrons do not work correctly, it can lead to a wide range of health problems - from abnormal water and salt loss, to dangerously high blood pressure.

The findings will help scientists to grow nephrons in the lab that can be used to study how kidneys function.

These pictures shows two different views of nephrons growing in the laboratory. On the left, the green and red areas highlight cells that filter waste products from the blood (shown in purple and red on the right. The blue/green section in both shows where urine is collected and taken away for excretion

Also, the use of time-lapsed imaging means that, rather than requiring different litters of mice to study different developmental stages, the same animals can be studied over time.

This leads to a significant reduction in the number of animals needed for this type of research.

'This is the first time we have been able to identify the molecular signals that instruct cells exactly how to form functional nephrons,' said Dr Peter Hohenstein, of the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute.

'By using time lapse imaging, we can get detailed information about the signals that control how kidneys form at different time-points in development,' Dr Nils Lindstrom, of the University of Edinburgh, added.

'This means that we can use fewer animals and obtain much more information than normal imaging techniques.'
