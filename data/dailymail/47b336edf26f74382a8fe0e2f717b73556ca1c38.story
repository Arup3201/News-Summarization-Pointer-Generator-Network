Homophobic abuse is rampant in our schools with new research revealing that 80 percent of students experienced distressing comments in PE classes.

The beyondblue study found that casual comments such as 'you're so gay', which may not have been intended to upset someone, were causing mental health problems in students with higher levels of depression and anxiety reported.

The research led by Victoria University was based on 399 Australian secondary school students between the age of 14 and 22 and focused on young people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual and gender diverse.

Leading the study, Dr Caroline Symons from Victoria University, says although aware of the term 'gay' being casually used, it was a surprise to learn that majority of Australian secondary students attracted to same sex found it so distressing.

‘It’s part of this negative mirror about them being gay. It doesn’t help them very much with their self-acceptance.’

Apart from verbal homophobic abuse, the research also found that a quarter of young people in school PE lessons reported physical abuse and pushing.

The survey also looked at the effect homophobic bullying has on students mental health, by comparing the levels of stress, anxiety and depression in the participants to a sample of 187 straight students.

‘The results showed severe ratings of depression among gay and lesbians were almost double of that of their counterparts,’ says Dr Symons.

The paper highlights PE as a particularly problematic environment with substantial homophobic behaviour.

‘Sport can be a challenging environment for gays and lesbians. It is very gender orientated and it has traditional ways of being male and female.

‘The gender traditions are reinforced in the rules of sport and have been shown to be very difficult for students at a critical age range, 14-22 years, beginning their involvement in sport and forming life-long physical activity patterns.’

Chief Executive Officer of beyondblue, Georgie Harman, says their organisation is committed to finding out reasons for depression and preventing it.

'Sport and physical activity is a preventative and protective role, it is very troubling that at an important time with understanding their sexuality, they are subjected to that abuse.'

Ms Harman says that this study was extremely important in identifying a place in which this behaviour happens.

As a result of the findings, beyondblue has called for a stand on the type of language used in schools, the intervention of teachers and the creation of an inclusive and safe environment for students experiencing homophobic abuse.

Dr Symons says there are gay and lesbian awareness initiatives currently in place in Australia and the UK that focus on sports, however greater awareness and equipping teachers and schools on how to tackle homophobic abuse is the key.
