Usain Bolt has caused embarrassment to Virgin Media after being caught performing crude dance moves at a pre-carnival party in Trinidad and Tobago.

The Olympic legend, who features in a number of Virgin adverts for broadband, was pictured in Momentum nightclub 'daggering' with a participating female.

The controversial dance, which originated in Mr Bolt's native Jamaica, is designed to imitate sexual intercourse.

Often seen during carnivals, the dance is known for its sexually explicit style and is usually performed to dancehall music.

The Olympic record holder appeared happy to be photographed as he took part in the dance in front of fans.

At the height of six foot and five inches, the Jamaican sprinter towered over the unknown female as they danced together on stage.

The athlete, dressed in  a black vest and bright orange shorts, also spoke to fans from the stage.

Mr Bolt is widely believed to be the fastest man in the world, and has set world records in both the 100- and 200-metre races

He has since return to his gruelling 
work schedule as he shares a Instagram video with fans captioned: ‘Early
 morning Electro Stimulation work out..strengthening of the core..no 
pain no gain..the journey must continue #SeriousFace 
#ForeverFaster#ElectroStimulation #StillHungry’.

Mr Bolt is widely believed to be the fastest man in the world, and has set world records in both the 100- and 200-metre races.

He has set three world records in the Olympics and won gold medals in the 100- and 200-metre races at both the 2008 and 2012 Games.

Virgin Media declined to comment.

Originating from Jamaica, daggering is a controversial dance form designed to imitate sexual intercourse.

It is considered more explicit than grinding and can include acrobatic stunts in which one partner jumps on to another from a height.

The dance is said to have been performed in Jamaica for a number of years but has only recently become known by the name daggering.

There have been efforts in recent years to crack down on daggering in Jamaica, with the nation’s Broadcast Commission banning songs and music videos which show or promote the dance.

The rise in popularity of daggering has also been a concern for those in the medical profession.

The dance has reportedly resulted in a rise in the number of men fracturing and damaging their penises.
