Criminals are using the online small ads site Gumtree, which allows people to sell everything from cars to mobile phones and even pets, to steal millions of pounds from innocent consumers.

Citizens Advice is issuing a warning today after revealing that one in six of the consumer problems it has investigated associated with Gumtree was a scam or potential scam.

Police are receiving around 250 crime and fraud allegations a week that are connected to the site, some of which involve serious thefts and assault.

Criminals are using the online small ads site Gumtree, which allows people to sell everything from cars to mobile phones and even pets, to steal millions of pounds from innocent consumers

And figures from the National Fraud Intelligence Bureaux reveal online shopping and auction scams were the most common fraud reported in 2013, costing UK consumers £63.6 million.

Gumtree is particularly vulnerable because the website does not vet or take identification details from its users, which means it can be used time and again by criminals who are difficult to trace.

The website is owned by eBay, which does have ID checking but is also vulnerable to criminal scams, according to research by Citizens Advice. It said one in ten problems it has looked at associated with eBay was a scam or potential scam.

The watchdog gave the example of a flat hunter who saw a property advertised on Gumtree and handed over £1,650 to the person he thought was the landlord. However, when he tried to move in, someone else was already living there.

In another case a man bought a car on eBay for £360 and spent another £700 on repairs, however it was then repossessed because the previous owner had failed to pay off an outstanding loan.

However, this is just the tip of the iceberg and there is evidence from a large and growing number of court cases and police reports that criminals use Gumtree to:

Citizens Advice looked at problems reported to its offices in the six months to the end of March which concerned products or services bought through Gumtree and eBay. There were 649 cases related to Gumtree and 3,711 to eBay.

Victims of online crime are invited to report the case to Action Fraud, which collects the details and passes some of them on to local police forces. However, this regime has fallen into disrepute because many victims, some of whom have lost huge sums, are never contacted by the police.

The chief executive of Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy, said: ‘Online marketplaces are at risk of becoming a hotbed for scams.

‘These sites are an important service for buyers and sellers, but con artists are profiting from them too.  Scammers are swindling people out of out of hundreds or thousands of pounds by posting false products and services online.

‘Con artists are preying on those still trying to get back on their feet from the recession. Fake jobs and phoney homes are taking people’s deposits that they strived and saved so long for.  

‘Businesses need to get savvy to these spurious practices and take steps to stop consumers falling foul of scams.

Gumtree is particularly vulnerable because the website does not vet or take identification details from its users, which means it can be used time and again by criminals who are difficult to trace

‘It’s time for online marketplaces to up their game and do more to protect their customers from dodgy dealings by strongly policing their websites, carrying out spot checks and immediately removing any risky ads.’

Gumtree said: ‘We do everything in our power to keep scammers off our site and encourage anyone that has fallen for a scam, to report it to us and the police.

‘Gumtree is an open platform which provides a free and easy way to buy and sell, meaning we do not track user information. We are always looking at new ways to improve customer safety such as improving methods of communication between us and our customers.

‘We encourage all our users to adhere to our safety tips on the site and discourage people from transferring any money in advance of seeing an item for sale.’

eBay questioned the validity of the research. It said that the 371 cases examined by Citizens Advice should be put in the context of the fact the UK version of the auction site receives 19million visitors each month.

It said: ‘eBay invests millions of pounds each year doing just what the Citizens Advice Bureau recommends: strongly policing our website, carrying out spot checks and immediately removing any risky ads.  Customers who purchase on eBay are covered by the eBay Money Back Guarantee and get the item they ordered, or their money back.’
