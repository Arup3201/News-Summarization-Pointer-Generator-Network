Top Gear presenter James May has blamed social networking sites for ruining surprises on the show - and says they could spell the end for privacy.

The host - dubbed Captain Slow by fellow stars Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond - says that any filming the 'three morons' do in a public place is now immediately filmed or photographed by the public and then posted online.

The 49-year-old said that fans post the footage on sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube and ruin any surprises for the viewers.

And he predicted a time when they will no longer even need film crews because there will be so much pooled footage available on the internet that fans will be able to make their own versions of the BBC2 show.

Writing in the current Top Gear magazine he says that previously, people would have had to physically pass an image or video around - but now it was possible to let the entire world see a photo through the powers of posting online.

He said: 'These days, it's quite 
difficult to surprise you on the telly, because everything we do in any 
vaguely public place is immediately filmed, photographed or noted and 
then exposed on Twitbook and FaceTube.'

May predicted a time where members of the public would be so adept with social media and videos, that they would make the show

Top Gear is the product of an army of experts, but the presenter fears that its surprises are scuppered by people eager to share their filming footage on the internet

He said 'spoilers' that people post are 
usually grainy and unprofessional, and highlight how much work and 
effort goes into turning the presenters' antics into 'a vaguely 
watchable TV programme'.

He praised directors, cameramen, sound recordists, editors, producers and experts for creating the 'magic' of the car show.

But he claimed soon people would learn how to create professional-looking clip and products.

The trio crossed the English Channel in boats made out of cars. The crew watched as the presenters bobbed up and down in ramshackle-looking vessels.

He wrote: 'So I see a future where we don't need to film and edit Top Gear. You will do it for us.

'We will arrange to drive some £500 cars to France (where the producers have come up with a series of challenges), and you will pool your footage to make an item.'

The show, which has run for a total of 
18 series, the latest finishing in March 2012, is believed to have a 
massive 350 million viewers per week in 170 different countries.

It features a number of regular features including a challenge for the presenters, Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car and power laps, where the show's 'tame racing driver' The Stig completes a lap around the Top Gear test track to gauge the performance of various cars.

In September, MailOnline reported how co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson was set for a £5million windfall after the BBC bought out his stake in Bedder 6, which he set up five years ago with Top Gear's executive producer Andy Wilman, to exploit the programme's global brand.

Bedder 6 has had huge success making money out of Top Gear merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international sales rights.

It was understood the total deal for both men was worth around £8million. The money was to come from the BBC’s commercial division.

Clarkson has also signed a lucrative new deal to continue presenting BBC 2's popular motoring show for three more years alongside James May and Richard Hammond, and is likely to be paid a fixed annual £500,000 talent fee by the broadcaster up until 2015.

The new series returns on January 27.
