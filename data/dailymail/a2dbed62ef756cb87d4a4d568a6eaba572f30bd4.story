Bribed: Jailed Sainsbury's buyer John Maylam outside Croydon Crown Court

A corrupt Sainsbury’s executive who took bribes of cash and lavish hospitality worth £5million in return for a multi-million-pound contract was jailed for four years yesterday.

John Maylam, 45, who was in charge of buying potato crops for the supermarket, allowed Greenvale, a major supplier, to overcharge Sainsbury’s by £8.7million for its crop in a £40million deal.

Using complex financial arrangements, he was able to artificially inflate the price without his bosses noticing.

In return, Greenvale laundered the money through bogus companies and vastly excessive expenses funds that Maylam used to live like a millionaire.

During a two-year period, Greenvale siphoned off £4.9million from Sainsbury’s and placed it in an account known as ‘The Fund’.

Maylam used it to treat himself to a £93,000 Aston Martin V8 Vantage, took his wife to some of the best hotels in the world, enjoyed extravagant yachting trips and regularly consumed fine wines and Dom Perignon champagne.

He also ran up a £200,000 bill while staying at Claridge’s hotel in Mayfair for 137 nights, and was taken on a £350,000 holiday to watch the Monaco Grand Prix.

Police were called in and the trio arrested after irregular payments were discovered during an audit by accountants at Produce Investments, Greenvale’s parent company.

Yesterday, Greenvale director Andrew Behagg, 60, and accounts manager David Baxter, 50, were jailed for three years and two-and-a-half years respectively for their parts in the scam.

Jailing the three men, Judge Nicholas Ainley said: ‘This is a case of bribery and corruption. But not just that, this is a case of corruption involving theft on a huge scale.’ He said Sainsbury’s was, in effect, ‘being bribed with its own money’.

He added: ‘As far as Maylam and Baxter
were concerned, it was a till to be rifled, and Behagg signed off 
ludicrous expenses claims knowing his company would not be paying the 
money but Sainsbury’s would.’

Croydon Crown Court in south London 
heard how Maylam and Baxter – who were highly respected by their 
employers – became drinking partners and concocted the scam.

As a senior buyer for Sainsbury’s, 
Maylam had almost total control of its potato budget. Sainsbury’s was 
overcharged £8.7million between 2005 and 2007 and the expenses account 
at Greenvale accumulated £4.9million from 2006 to 2008.

Maylam received payments via an account in Luxembourg to the tune of £1.5million and ran up expenses of £20,000 a month.

In May 2007, Maylam jetted off to the
south of France and Monte Carlo with his wife, Baxter and three others 
for an all-expenses-paid holiday for his 40th birthday.

The total bill for their rooms, meals 
and corporate hospitality tickets for the Monaco Grand Prix came to over
£350,000. Maylam’s bill for a presidential suite during the race was 
£48,000 alone.

Greenvale simply signed off the trip as ‘team building’.

Nicholas Walker, defending Maylam, said his client’s spending was ‘out of touch and excessive almost to the point of vulgarity’.

Baxter also used his company’s expenses account liberally, and notched up 77 nights at Claridge’s.

Eventually he was treated for liver 
cirrhosis because he was drinking so much champagne and fine wine. He is
believed to have personally netted £100,000 from the scam.

Outside court, Detective 
Superintendent Tony Crampton, of the City of London Police, said: 
‘Maylam and Baxter both had good jobs with decent salaries, but they 
wanted a place on millionaires’ row.

They were greedy for a luxury 
lifestyle – frittering the money away on frivolous spending which was 
only made possible by Behagg’s complicity.

‘The men thought their fraud was so complex they would not be detected.’

Maylam, of Maidstone, Kent, and 
Baxter, of Hinstock, near Market Drayton in Shropshire, admitted  
corruption and acquiring criminal property at an earlier hearing.

Behagg, of Chatteris in 
Cambridgeshire, was found guilty by a jury  in May of authorising 
payments in return for lucrative contracts.
