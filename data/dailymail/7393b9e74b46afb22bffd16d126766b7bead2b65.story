Mollie King landed herself a modelling contract earlier this year - and it seems that another member of The Saturdays is giving her a run for her money.

Vanessa White, known as the 'party girl' of the pop group, has been snapped up by Select Model Management, where she joins their Women’s Special Talent division.

Vanessa, 24, will be joining a roster of top UK faces including Agyness Deyn and Sienna Miller, as well as talents such as Laura Whitmore, Millie Macintosh and Tom Odell.
