US coffee chain Starbucks has finally paid corporation tax, for the first time since 2008.

Bowing to pressure from MPs and the public late last year Starbucks agreed to pay £20million in corporation tax by 2015 and the Exchequer has now received the first £5million, the company said today.

The payment comes after the coffee chain faced a wave of protest late last year and was condemned by politicians for failing to pay corporation tax for almost every year since it began operating in Britain in 1998.

Starbucks’ chief financial officer Troy Alstead told the influential House of Commons Public Accounts Committee last December that the coffee shop chain had made a loss for 14 of the last 15 years, achieving only a small profit in 2006.

Public outcry: Starbucks faced a wave of public protest over its failure to pay corporation tax in almost every one of the last 15 years

But he and executives from other large 
corporations including Google and Amazon were branded ‘immoral’ by the 
committee’s Labour chairman Margaret Hodge.

Starbucks was revealed to have paid 
nothing in corporation tax between 2009 and 2012, despite sales of 
£400million in 2011, and had only paid £8.6million since it began trading
in the UK.

Last year, Starbucks told investors its European businesses made a $40million (£26million) profit in 2011, but accounts filed for its UK, German, and French units, which make up 90 per cent of European revenues, showed a loss of $60 million (£39million) for the year to September 30 2012.

This year however the European arm of the company has turned a profit. In its most recent trading update Starbucks said operating profit in Europe was $5.2million (£3.4million) for the three months to 25 April, up $12.2million (£7.9million) on an operating loss of $7million (£4.5million) for the same period a year earlier.

A Starbucks spokeswoman said today: ‘Six
months ago, we felt that our customers should not have to wait for us 
to become profitable before we started paying UK corporation tax.

‘We listened to our customers in 
December and so decided to forgo certain deductions which would make us 
liable to pay £10 million in corporation tax this year and a further £10
million in 2014.

‘We have now paid £5 million and will pay the remaining £5 million later this year.

‘We are also undertaking measures to 
make Starbucks profitable in the UK, such as relocating unprofitable 
stores to more cost effective locations, closing them where that is not 
possible and placing greater reliance on franchised and licensed 
stores.’

Legal and fair: Starbucks' chief financial officer Troy Alstead claimed late last year that the coffee shop chain was an 'extremely high taxpayer' despite having paid no corporation tax since 2008

Tax avoidance has become a major theme for
the Coalition Government as it has pursued a policy of austerity since 
coming to power three years ago. Downing Street has previously been 
criticised for lowering the top rate of income tax from 50 per cent to 
45 per cent and for imposing cuts to benefits payments while not doing 
enough to close tax loopholes.

Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron 
announced he had secured agreement with Britain's network of overseas 
territories and Crown dependencies to sign up to a new global clampdown 
on tax evasion.

Tax, and the use of global tax havens, 
also formed one of the major themes of last week’sG8 Summit at Lough 
Erne, Northern Ireland.

The first payment in corporation tax to 
be made by Starbucks for five years follows a fiery showdown with MPs late last year.

Too little to latte: But Mr Alstead's claims drew a wave of fresh protests and led to consumers boycotting the coffee shop's stores until Starbucks eventually agreed to pay £20million in corporation tax in December

Starbucks insisted it was ‘an extremely 
high taxpayer’ globally and acted ‘to an ethical’ as well as a legal 
standard, despite declaring losses on its UK operation.’

Mr Alstead blamed an over-aggressive 
entry to the UK market for its failure to pay corporation tax claiming 
the strategy had left the coffee chain with expensive properties that 
did not make money.

‘It is fundamentally true, everything we
are saying and everything we have said historically,’ he told the 
committee while saying Starbucks remained committed to making profits 
here.

He conceded a tax deal struck with the 
Dutch authorities - that he declined to detail - was ‘an attractive 
reason’ for basing the coffee company's operations there.

However, it later emerged the deal saw 
around 6 per cent of Starbucks’ UK branch profits reduced to 4.7 per 
cent in what one MP called a ‘cosmetic’ deal with the UK tax office, 
before being transferred to the Netherlands holding company as a 
dividend, meaning there was no profit to declare.

Starbucks also charges a 20 per cent mark-up on coffee which it buys via Switzerland where it pays 12 per cent tax.

‘Respectfully, I can assure you there is no tax avoidance here,’ insisted Mr Alstead at the time.

‘We have a global tax rate of 33 per 
cent around the world. Our tax rate outside the US is 21 per cent. That 
is higher than most multinationals' global rate. We are an extremely 
high tax payer.’
