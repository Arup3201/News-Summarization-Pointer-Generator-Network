Manchester United defender Chris Smalling will be out for two weeks after injuring his groin in Monday night's win at Southampton.

The England centre halfl will miss Sunday's crunch clash with Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League at Old Trafford, the following week's visit to Newcastle and maybe the Boxing Day clash with Newcastle at home.

Smalling's injury was the latest in a long line of muscle problems to afflict Louis van Gaal's squad this season, leading to suggestions there is a problem with the United manager's training methods.

Smalling is the latest in a long line of absentees at United, who have struggled with injuries all season

Former Manchester United assistant boss Mike Phelan has blamed Van Gaal’s fitness regime for the catalogue of injuries after  Smalling became the club’s 43rd casualty of the season.

United are currently also without summer signings Angel di Maria, Daley Blind and Luke Shaw, while Rafael and Phil Jones have just returned to training. 

Phelan, who spent 12 years working alongside Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, believes Van Gaal’s decision to bring in his own fitness specialist Jos van Dijk to oversee first-team training at the start of the season and give Tony Strudwick a broader role has led to the injury pile-up with so many players ‘breaking down’.

‘What’s happened is a continuation of the same players getting injured all the time, so you have to look to the reasons why,’ said Phelan, who is now first-team coach at Norwich City.

Manager Louis van Gaal has overseen a chronic amount of injuries since taking charge in the summer

‘I think Manchester United changed their thoughts on the fitness regime. They looked at it a little bit differently.

‘Tony Strudwick, who was operating as head of sports science and was involved day to day with the first-team. He understood the ins and outs of how to keep players fit, how to keep them ready for competition. 

‘Then suddenly they moved him sideways and did something completely different. That may have had an effect. That one area has changed.

‘They’ve brought in new people with a different way of doing things. The intensity of training may be one thing – it may be too intense, or not intense enough – but obviously slight changes have been made with the present way of doing things.

‘I would have thought the squad is big enough at Manchester United, because they can go out and get players in, but obviously they keep breaking down and they don’t seem to be getting any better. They seem to get one back and lose another two.’
