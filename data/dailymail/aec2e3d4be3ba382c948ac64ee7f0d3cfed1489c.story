Their crucial encounter with Italy is only four days away, so England fans would have hoped key players are putting their feet up between training sessions.

But strikers Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck took a more relaxed approach to their preparations today, as they tried their hand at a Brazilian form of martial arts with a group of youngsters.

The pair, along with Adam Lallana, Fraser Forster and Jack Wilshere, joined in with the Capoeira demonstration during a visit to Rio's infamous Rocinha Favela.

They balanced on one hand, raised their legs over the youngsters' heads and bent down like they were ready to grapple as one man played the drums.

The
 Capoeria is a martial art that was developed by slaves in the 16th century and combines dancing with acrobatics and music.

The 'Three 
Lions' contingent visited a sports complex attached to the Favela – or 
slum – as part of a continued charity initiative which was started by 
the FA and the players when they visited Brazil last year.

The Favela is home to a staggering 70,000 people and is one of the poorest areas of Brazil.

Acrobatics: The strikers moved into the centre of the circle, with Manchester United's Danny Welbeck performing a handstand

Steady: Sturridge then pulled off an impressive move, balancing on one hand on the artificial football pitch

The sports complex on the edge of the
 Rocinha neighbourhood is said to have played a major part in the 
regeneration of the area since it was opened more than four years ago.

The
 complex provides a football pitch and area which allows youngsters to 
enjoy sports such as boxing , volleyball, tennis, swimming, martial arts
 and  skateboarding.

The complex also provides a 24hr Accident & 
Emergency unit, a family clinic and a psychosocial clinic.

During
 the afternoon visit the players – who were joined by former England and
 West Ham player and now FA Director of Football Development Sir Trevor 
Brooking and Club England Managing Director Adrian Bevington -  met and 
mixed with a group of children that regularly use the complex.

At
 one stage Liverpool striker Sturridge and Manchester United forward 
Welbeck performed cartwheels with some of the children who in turn 
showed the players their martial arts skills.

The England World Cup squad have now 
pledged to donate a five figure sum to the Rocinha complex through their
 charity the  Footballers Foundation Charity .

Arsenal
 and England midfielder Jack Wilshere said during the visit: ‘The entire
 squad is keen to gain an appreciation of our surroundings and 
experience the culture of Brazil during our time here.

'The
 visit to the Rocinha Sports Complex provided an incredible insight into
 the unique and powerful role sport plays in this country.

‘With one of the poorest areas of the 
city situated just metres away, the complex provides an opportunity, 
through sport, for residents of the favela to transform and enrich their
 lives.’

Another player – Southampton’s Adam Lallana – said: ‘The Sports Complex has helped to completely transform one of the poorest and potential violent areas of Rio.

'The facility provides an incredible opportunity for children to enjoy the simple pleasures of sport – and in doing so can help to take their lives in the right direction.

‘It was an honour for the players to be invited to the centre today.’

Moves: The Brazilians also got the chance to be the centre of attention, performing cartwheels

Earlier in the day the England team staff and players welcomed more than 100 children, young people and local residents to their Urca training base in Rio de Janeiro as they began final preparations for their FIFA World Cup 2014 campaign which begins when they play Italy in the Amazonian city of Manaus on Saturday evening.

At one stage Liverpool striker Sturridge laughed as he tried to copy the dance routine of a Brazilian child and joked: ‘I can't do that’ - before he then performed a double back flip as his personal finale.

During the visit by the players the smell from the favela sewer wafted across a small 5-a-side Astroturf football pitch close to the multi-coloured shacks and huts making up the slum.

Welbeck said after the visit:

‘It is something I really wanted to do, it is great. I was here last year in Rio, and this time I am really feeling the vibe of the country. It was great to see the kids, they are just enjoying their lives.’

Midfield star  Lallana -  who carries photographs of his young son in his kit bag, said:

‘The kids are unbelievable. It is nice to see a different side of Brazil, on the beach we only see the lovely waves and sea. The favela is completely different.’

Kicking out: Sturridge looks impressed as one of the youngsters manages to get almost horizontal to the ground while performing a flip
