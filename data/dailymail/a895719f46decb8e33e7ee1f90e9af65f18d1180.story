It's long been known than a smelly pair of feet bears more than a slight resemblance to a block of ripe cheese, but scientists have taken this link to the next level by making cheese from a foot.

Experts have made the stomach-churning creations using bacteria from the human foot as well as a belly button and even an armpit.

Scientist Christina Agapakis and scent expert Sissel Tolaas gathered microbes for their project 'Selfmade' which recently debuted at an exhibition about synthetic biology in Dublin.

Ms Tolaas said on her website: 'Selfmade is a series of ‘microbial sketches’, portraits reflecting an individual’s microbial landscape in a unique cheese.'

The cheese is supposed to reflect the flavours of the humans they belong to.

Like the human body, each cheese has a unique set of microbes that metabolically shape a unique odour.

Tangy: The stomach-churning creations were made by experts who harvested bacteria from donors

Each cheese was crafted from starter cultures sampled from the skin of a different person. The bacteria included that harvested from an armpit (pictured), a foot and a bellybutton

There are eleven cheeses in the exhibition.

Each cheese was created using starter cultures sampled from the skin of artists, scientists, anthropologists, and cheese makers.

The samples of bacteria used in the cheese came from armpits, a foot, a bellybutton and tears and were taken using sterile cotton swabs.

Ms Agapakis told Dezeen: 'Despite [their] chemical and biological similarities, there are obviously very different cultural and emotional responses to stinky cheese and stinky feet.

Ms Agapakis said: 'By making cheese directly from the microbes on the body, we want to highlight these bacterial connections as well as to question and potentially expand the role of both odours and microbes in our lives'

Ms Agapakis and Ms Tolaas say that their project explores synthetic biology through the practices of traditional cheesemaking

'By making cheese directly from the microbes on the body, we want to highlight these bacterial connections as well as to question and potentially expand the role of both odors and microbes in our lives.'

A short film was also created that explains the process of the human cheesemaking, along with interviews with the people who donated bacteria samples.

However, the designers said that the cheese wasn't made to be eaten and instead has been created 'to inspire new conversations about our relationship to the body and to our bacteria.'

There are hundreds of distinct cheese varieties produced around the world today, and all are made with varying recipes, techniques, and trade secrets.Despite all the varieties, they all undergo the same essential process. 

STAGE ONEAim: To produce curds from the protein found in milk

Milk is pasteurised and a bacteriological starter is added to ‘sour’ and thicken the milk.

A renneting agent is added to the milk to form curds. Nowadays, most British cheeseproduced uses a non-animal renneting agent, making the cheese suitable for vegetarians.

The curd is left to set.

STAGE TWOAim: To concentrate the curd

The curds are cut so that the whey is released (soft cheeses are cut lightly while hardcheeses are cut finely).

The curds are either ‘cooked’ or are piled on top of each other (the process known as‘cheddaring’), and further cut to expel whey.

The curd is milled and salt is added (in some recipes salt is included by immersingthe moulded cheese in a bath of brine for several days).

The curd is pressed into moulds.

STAGE THREEAim: To ripen the cheese

The cheese is placed in storage rooms where temperature and humidity are controlledand varied according to the cheese being produced (Cheddar was originally stored inSomerset’s Cheddar Gorge caves).

Mild Cheddar is generally stored for around three months, whilst Mature Cheddar is stored for up to a year. Cheeses have very individual storage processes that create their distinctive flavours and textures.

During the first week of Blue Stilton’s storage, it is turned daily to ensure an even distribution of moisture throughout the cheese.
