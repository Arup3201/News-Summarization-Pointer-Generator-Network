This is the shocking moment a drug-fuelled football hooligan ran on to the pitch and launched a vicious assault on a player.

George Galamaz, a defender for Romanian side Steaua Bucharest, had his right cheekbone broken and temporarily lost his hearing in the attack by the fan.

The incident sparked an on-field brawl as Galamaz's teammates sought retribution. Two of them were sent off for attacking the fan.

The league match between Steaua and 
Petrolul Ploiești at the hostile Ilie Oana stadium in Ploiești had to be
 abandoned as crowd trouble flared.

Prosecutors said that the fan, 
Dragos Petrut Enache, used a hard object to hit Galamaz and that he was 
high on drugs when he committed the attack on Sunday.

Enache has been charged with disturbing public order and committing violence.

After
 the incident, Galamaz's team-mates knocked the fan to the ground and 
began attacking him before he was whisked away by security staff.

Steaua were preparing to take a penalty when Enache ran 
onto the pitch and attacked Galamaz, who will be out of action for six 
weeks.

The attack prompted the referee stopped but Ploiesti fans soon
 began throwing flares onto the pitch, one of which struck Steaua 
goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu.

The match was then abandoned following another delay of 20 minutes while Tatarusanu received treatment on the pitch.

Ploiesti have been fined £2,000 by the Romanian FA for their handling of the match.

Enache is led away by police and stewards. He was found guilty of disturbing public order and committing violence
