The head of the Catholic church in Scotland has added his voice to growing calls for Christians to be allowed to express their beliefs at work.

In his Easter Sunday homily, Cardinal Keith O'Brien will urge Christians to  'wear proudly a symbol of the cross of Christ on their garments each and every day of their lives'.

Speaking at Edinburgh's St Mary's Cathedral tomorrow, he will quote 
Pope Benedict XVI, who said Christians 'need to be free to act in 
accordance with their own principles'.

Easter message: Cardinal Keith O'Brien (above), the head of the Scottish Catholic church, will call on Christians to 'wear proudly' a crucifix every day

He will add: 'I know that many of you do wear 
such a cross of Christ, not in any ostentatious way, not in a way that 
might harm you at your work or recreation, but a simple indication that 
you value the role of Jesus Christ in the history of the world, that you
are trying to live by Christ's standards in your own daily life.'

His message will give further weight to a campaign led by former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey which calls on Prime Minister David Cameron to back the legal rights of Christians at work.

He will say: 'I hope that increasing numbers of Christians adopt the practice of wearing a cross in a simple and discreet way as a symbol of their beliefs.

'Easter provides the ideal time to remind ourselves of the centrality of the cross in our Christian faith.

'A simple lapel cross pin costs around £1. Since this is less than a chocolate Easter egg, I hope many people will consider giving some as gifts and wearing them with pride.'

Lord Carey wants the Prime Minister to press for greater legal protection for Christians who have been sacked for following their consciences when a group of test cases are heard by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg next month.

Four Christians are taking legal action at a landmark hearing because they believe British laws have failed to protect their human rights to wear religious symbols or opt out of gay rights legislation.

The cases include those of Shirley Chaplin, a Devon nurse banned from working on the wards after she failed to hide a cross she had worn since she was 16, and Gary MacFarlane, who was sacked as a Relate counsellor after suggesting he would refuse to provide sexual therapy to gay couples.

The judges will also examine the cases of Nadia Eweida, a check-in clerk for British Airways who was told to remove her small crucifix at work, and registrar Lilian Ladele, who lost her job at Islington town hall, North London, after refusing to officiate at civil partnerships.

Demands: Religious leaders are calling on David Cameron to back Christians expressing their beliefs at work

A Scottish Government spokesman said: 
'Wearing a religious symbol is entirely a matter for individual members 
of staff. We have no policy as an employer.'

A
spokeswoman for the Scottish Parliament said: 'The Scottish Parliament 
does not have a specific policy for staff displaying religious symbols 
in their work attire.'

NHS 
Scotland advises health boards to 'conduct a full risk assessment' to 
ensure that their local dress code policy 'is appropriate for different 
categories of staff and should look to support staff in complying with 
both the needs of the service and any religious or cultural 
requirements'.
