A new survey shows just how little diversity there is in the fashion world, especially when it comes to magazine covers.

The Fashion Spot assessed 44 major print publications across the globe to determine which magazines did and did not feature models from a minority background on their cover at some point in 2014.

It found a shocking lack of diversity across the board, with white models appearing 567 times out of 611 total covers and people of colour appearing just 119 times.

Discrepancy: A new survey of 44 major print magazines has found a shocking lack of diversity, with white models appearing 567 times out of 611 total covers this year and people of color appearing just 119 times

Surprising ratio: That means that white women have been chosen as cover stars nearly five times as often as non-white women have made the cut

That means that white women were chosen as cover stars nearly five times more often than non-white women made the cut.

Of the magazines surveyed, a number of them failed to use a woman of minority on the cover at all, including Harper’s Bazaar U.S. and UK, Vogue UK, Vogue Netherlands, Vogue Paris, Vogue Ukraine, Vogue Russia, Teen Vogue, Numéro, LOVE and Porter.

And according to the survey, Vogue UK is the biggest disappointment when it comes to representing minorities.

In fact, the magazine has not featured a model of color on the cover in a whopping 12 years, the last instance being Naomi Campbell's appearance in 2002.

That being said, Vogue UK has featured several non-white celebrities of color over the years, including Beyonce in May 2013 and Rhianna in November 2011.

Lack of representation: Neither LOVE (left,  Fall/winter 2014 issue) nor Harper's Bazaar UK (right, September 2014 issue) has chosen a single cover model of color this year

Pattern: Vogue Korea (left, May 2014 issue) and Vogue Japan (right, July 2014 issue) also overwhelmingly chose white models for the cover, with Vogue Japan only featuring one model of Japanese descent all year

But when it comes to cover girls who are professional models, they all have been white.

Even Jourdan Dunn - who was named Model of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 2008 and was the first black British model to make Forbes' top-earning models list in 2014 - has never landed a solo Vogue UK cover.

Jourdan did appear on the cover with Eden Clark and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley on the November 2008 issue, but she is yet to star on the cover without any other models.

Meanwhile, her close pal Cara Delevingne has been on the cover of British Vogue twice this year alone, as has 40-year-old supermodel Kate Moss.

By the numbers: This graph shows that black models were the minority that was best represented on magazine covers, followed by those from an Asian background

Vogue Japan and Vogue Korea also overwhelmingly chose white models to appear on their covers in 2014, with Vogue Japan only featuring one model of Japanese descent all year.

They did, however, choose Puerto Rican beauty Joan Smalls for their December 2014 cover.

The glossy magazines who best represented minorities on the cover this year were Vogue India and Vogue Taiwan, the first of which used exclusively models of color in 2014. 

Most of Vogue Taiwan's 2014 cover models were also women of color, although for the May cover they picked Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr.
