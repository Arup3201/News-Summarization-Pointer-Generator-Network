After the balmiest Boxing Day for 28 years, it may come as no surprise to learn that 2011 is predicted to be the second warmest in the UK since records began more than a century ago.

Despite the summer being disappointingly cool, temperatures this past year were a degree warmer than the period between 1971 and 2000, figures from the Met Office show today. 

In the past month, there have been reports of daffodils budding 
and blooming in sheltered areas, while growers in south-west England are
already harvesting brassicas like cauliflower which they would usually 
expect to see mature in spring.

The average temperature so far this December has been 4.7C, 0.5C above the 1971-2000 average.

This is a big swing from 2010, when temperatures were 5C below average to notch up the coldest December on record.

The average temperature for the UK in 2011 was nearly 9.73C  - compared to the long term average of just 8.59C. 

Records dating back to 1910 show the year 2006 was only slightly warmer than 2011 with an average of 9.73C.

Seven of the top 10 warmest years have occurred in the last decade.

This year the UK enjoyed its warmest April since 1910 with temperatures 3.7C above average.

Britain also experienced an Indian 
Summer with October 1 becoming the warmest October day for more than a 
century when temperatures soared to 29.9C at Gravesend in 
Kent.                

It
is a huge difference from 2010 which in contrast was the 12th coldest 
year on record, with a UK average temperature of just eight degrees.

The average temperature for the UK in 2011 was nearly 9.73C - compared to the long term average of just 8.59C

'It has been a rather topsy turvy year and very different to last year,' said Tom Morgan, a forecaster for the Met Office.

'We had the warmest April on record, followed by a rather disappointing summer where temperatures were close to average and there was lots of rain.

'Then in the autumn we had the warmest October day since records began and have then had a November which was three degrees above average.'

The coldest day in 2011 was January 8, when temperatures dipped to minus 13C in Altnaharra in Scotland.

Saturday (New Year’s Eve) South: Cloudy with light rain  Max 12c (54f) Min 11c (52f) North: Cloudy with light rain             Max 11c  Min 7c (45f)                                Sunday (New Year’s Day) South: Cloudy with sunny spells         Max 11c Min 4c (39f) North: Sunny spells                             Max 8c (46f)   Min 1c (34c)   Monday South: Sunny spells                            Max 7c Min 5c (41f) North : Sunny spells and light rain      Max 5c  Min 3c (37f)

Gravesend was again the location for the
warmest October temperature ever, when 29.9C was recorded on October 1,
beating the previous record of 29.4C at March in Cambridgeshire on the 
same day in 1985.

The amount of rainfall also varied massively across the country.

Scotland had its wettest year on record with 73.2in (1,859.5mm) of rain, beating the previous record set in 1990.

But further south, parts of England had had very low rainfall.

East Anglia had its second driest year on record with just 17.6in 
(449mm) of rain and the Midlands had its third driest with 23in 
(586.5mm).

Just before Christmas, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) granted South East Water a drought order to help it refill Ardingly Reservoir, which was just 12 per cent full by the end of November, because of 'an exceptional lack of rain over the last eight months'.

South East Water said at the time: 'Normally we would expect rainfall in the early autumn to replenish our reservoirs after the summer, but an exceptionally dry September, October and November raised the urgency of the situation.'
