The WAG and designer has unveiled her SS15 range for Littlewoods.com and exudes vintage glamour in a new Sixties-inspired shoot.

Coleen clearly took notes at the fashion shows in September; her new range is full of ban- on trend short hem lines, Peter Pan collars and mellow yellow hues.

Speaking about her 14-piece range, which is priced between £32-£100, the mother-of-two explains she designed her collection with yummy mummies in mind.

She said: 'I always keep in mind what I need in my wardrobe when working on designs so the collection is perfect for busy mums.

'The yellow coat is a must­‐have because you can throw it on over anything and still look stylish on the school run.'
