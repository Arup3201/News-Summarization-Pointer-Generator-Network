A bride who was born a man has found happiness with a groom who was born a woman after meeting at a transgender support group.

Felix Laws and Helen Morfitt, from Hull, who have both changed sex, hope their love story will give hope to other people struggling with gender identity.

Helen, 56, who was born a boy called Leslie, told The Mirror: 'It might seem a bit strange to people on the outside but as far as we’re concerned we’re just like any other man and woman in love.

Finally found happiness: Helen Morfitt and Felix Laws will tie the knot this September

'We’ve been through a lot over the years and had tough times transitioning from one sex to another, but we’ve now found each other and that’s all that matters.'

Helen, who is now a support worker at Lincoln University, met Felix, 46, in 2008 when he attended a transgender support group she had set up to help people struggling with their gender like she had. 

'There
are a lot of barriers, both socially and psychologically, in the way of
people wanting to switch gender, so I wanted to help others overcome 
them using my experience,' she told the Hull Daily Mail. 

Before she had her sex change operation ten years ago, Helen had married three times and had eight children. She admits it was a very stressful time as she was 'trying to deny who I really was – a woman in a man's body.'

The couple met at a transgender support group Helen had set up to help people struggling with their identity

Helen said she remains friends with two of her exes and explained her sex change operation to her children before she went ahead with it.

She said: 'I was incredibly ill by then because of the stress. I told my two youngest, who were only five and six, that I was very poorly and the only way I could get better was to become a girl. They accepted it easily.'

Meanwhile Felix, a school teaching assistant who was born as a woman called Katy, was struggling with his identity.

He said: 'I'd known from the age of eight that I should have been born a boy. My friends were playing with dolls and prams but I wanted to climb trees, play football and get muddy.'

Real love: Between them they have ten children and four marriages but the pair say they've finally got romance right after changing their sexes

In a bid to try and repress his feelings, Felix married at the age of 21 and had two sons. While he loved his sons very much, he left them to live with their father when they were aged 10 and 12 because he was struggling so much with his desire to be a man.

After he sought help from his GP, Helen's support group was recommended to him and it was there that he met her and they fell in love.

He had a full sex change in 2009 and popped the question to Helen in 2011.

They will tie the knot in Gretna Green in September.

'I’ve been married three times before but this time I know it’s for real because I know I’m the right sex this time,' Helen said.
