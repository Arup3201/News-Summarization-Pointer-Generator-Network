Cover: No Easy Day is scheduled for release on September 4

The Navy SEAL turned author who was there as Osama bin Laden was killed and promised to 'set the record straight' about the mission that led to his demise has been identified as a soldier who has since retired from service.

The book's publisher announced on Wednesday that Mark Owen's 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden' would tell the real story about the raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011.

The book, to be published under the pseudonym 'Mark Owen,' is scheduled to be released on September 11 - the 11th anniversary of the devastating terror attacks in New York and Washington, DC.

But the former serviceman's attempts to remain anonymous were foiled on Thursday, when FoxNews.com identified him as Matt Bissonnette, 36, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, who retired shortly after the bin Laden mission.

Publisher Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Group, asked news organizations on Thursday to withhold his name.

But that didn’t stop the Associated Press, which later confirmed the the FoxNews.com report through their own sources, and circulated the information through its subscribers.

The revelation had alarm bells ringing in military circles.

Pentagon spokesman Lt Col James Gregory told MailOnline that the release of a former special ops soldier’s identity can be worrisome.

He said: ‘We protect the names of our special ops personnel for security reasons. Any time names are revealed, it’s a concern.'

In the dark: The Pentagon said that it has not seen a copy of the book, despite regulations designed to keep former and current military personnel from spilling military secrets

Lt Col Gregory also joined a chorus of U.S. agencies who claim they had no knowledge of the book before Wednesday, a possible violation of regulations that bar current and former troops from spilling military matters and national security issues.

Other departments, including the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and even the White House, were also caught off-guard.

That could spell trouble for Bissonnette, who may be subject to federal charges if sensitive information appears in the book.

Lt Col Gregory said that since he is now a private citizen, the military could refer the investigation to the Department of Justice.

Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House

But any judicial action would hinge on the content of No Easy Day.

'We
 don't know what kind of details [are in the book], so we can't make a 
determination over whether it's classified or not,' Lt Col Gregory said.

But the publisher maintains that 
Bissonnette's writings were properly vetted by a former special 
operations attorney, and will not let any military cats out of the bag.

Christine Ball, a spokeswoman for the Dutton, the publisher, told Reuters: 'He vetted it for tactical, technical, and procedural information as well as information that could be considered classified by compilation and found it to be without risk to national security.'

Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down

No Easy Day is co-authored by journalist Kevin 
Maurer, has worked on four previous books - including two in the last 
year and a half about soldiers in Afghanistan.

Maurer
 spent the last several years embedded with troops in Iraq and 
Afghanistan as a military correspondent for the Fayetteville Observer.

The New York Times's Media Decoder blog reported on Wednesday that the book also goes into detail about Bissonnette's incredible training that led him to become a Navy SEAL.

The blog added that the book will 
culminate with a 'blow by blow' account of the dramatic raid in the 
terror leader's Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound.

No Easy Day's listing on Amazon.com 
says that among Owen's hundreds of missions around the world as a SEAL Team 
Six commando was the rescue of Capt Richard Phillips from Somali pirates
 in 2009.

Owen's book comes on the heels of 
another account of the bin Laden takedown that claims the raid was nixed
 three times by Obama, but finally went ahead at the urging of Hillary 
Clinton.

That explosive allegation is 
contained in an expose by journalist Rich Miniter, who argues that the 
White House’s carefully-crafted narrative of Obama as a decisive leader 
who took out the al-Qaeda leader despite the doubts of advisers is a 
myth.

Leading from Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him was published on Tuesday.

A
 film about the bin Laden raid, Zero Dark Thirty - from Hurt Locker 
director Kathryn Bigelow - is due to be released December 19.

Republicans chided the White House earlier this year amid reports that Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal - who both won Academy Awards for The Hurt Locker - were given unprecedented access to classified information.

The Obama administration denied the claims.
