MPs accused of bullying or ‘unwanted sexual advances’ face being investigated by Parliament’s powerful standards authority.

Commons speaker John Bercow has asked the sleaze watchdog to examine harassment claims made by people working in the Houses of Parliament.

It means the Commons standards commissioner which usually focuses on claims of expenses fiddling or dodgy donations will also probe the behaviour of MPs accused of abusing their position in the corridors of power.

Complaints against MPs accused of bullying or sexual harassment could now be dealt with by the Commons standards commissioner

The House of Commons Commission, chaired by Mr Bercow, has asked the Committee on Standards to draw up a system to allow for ‘allegations of harassment or bullying of House staff’ to be investigated.

A full probe would be launched in cases where ‘resolution is not possible by other means, and if the complaint is sufficiently grave’.

It follows means those found guilty will be named and shamed, and could even be suspended from Parliament.

Commons Speaker John Bercow drew up the respect policy to prevent staff being abused

MPs are warned against offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, including an abuse or misuse of power.

‘It is important to remember that it is the impact of the action that matters, not what was intended; offence may be caused intentionally or unintentionally,’ the Commons Respect policy states.

It warns against ‘unwelcome sexual advances – touching, standing too close, the display of offensive  materials, asking for sexual favours and making decisions on the basis of sexual advances being accepted or rejected’.

MPs are also banned from ‘copying memos that are critical about someone to others who do not need to know’.

Other behaviour which could trigger an investigation include ridiculing or demeaning someone, overbearing supervision or other misuse of power or position, unfair treatment and  threatening or abusive language or behaviour.

It follows reports of Commons staff being left in tears after being abused by MPs, particularly those who have taken advantage of Parliament’s subsidised bars.

Complaints about food, drink and service after often considered to be over-the-top.

Staff at the expenses watchdog IPSA have reported being described as ‘monkeys’, ‘nutty’, and ‘f***ing idiots’.

The Commons Respect agenda published by Mr Bercow makes clear: ‘All staff deserve, and should expect to be treated with, respect for who they are and what they do.

‘Members must not discriminate against, victimise, harass or bully any member of staff.’

MPs found guilty of abusing their position over staff could be suspended from the Commons

Under current rules complaints about MPs’ behaviour are dealt with internally and can be referred to the Speaker.

But now they could be dealt with by the Committee on Standards, which published a report into complaints it examines.

A spokesman for the Speaker said: ‘The House of Commons commission has asked the committee on standards to look at how grave allegations of harassment or bullying of staff are investigated and properly dealt with.’
