Teachers forced out of schools at the centre of the Trojan Horse allegations have been gagged by the authorities.

At least 12 senior staff – most of them heads – were banned from speaking out as part of their six-figure pay-off deals, it emerged last night.

Some claim they were bullied, intimidated and threatened over the bid by extremists to target state schools in Birmingham.

Staying mute: Former members of staff at the Birmingham Schools at the centre of the Trojan Horse allegations, including Oldknow Academy, have been gagged by pay-off deals

Their concerns were vindicated this week when a three-month inquiry concluded that an organised campaign had been waged by governors to impose extreme Islamic policies on pupils, leading to a ‘culture of fear and intimidation’ among staff.

Despite this, the teachers still feel unable to discuss what happened at their schools. And yesterday neither the Department for Education nor Birmingham City Council would guarantee the whistleblowers would not face action for speaking out.

Local MP Khalid Mahmood called on the Government and council to ensure that former staff would be released from the gagging clauses.

Mr Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said: ‘A lot of people are still not speaking even in private because they are frightened of what may happen.

'We need to get it out in the open. They need to be able to tell their stories.’

Urgent request: Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, Khalid Mahmood, has said the 'gagging clauses' should be removed so staff at the Trojan Horse schools can speak out

The former head of Park View Academy resigned after being 'reduced to a figure head', and sources say she was used as a 'white face' to make the school's governing body seem diverse

He called on Education Secretary 
Michael Gove and the council to issue ‘clear guidance’ that would ensure
 staff could tell the truth about what happened.

Reports
 by Ofsted and the Education Funding Agency revealed that Muslim 
governors had attempted to impose an Islamic agenda on several schools, 
effectively turning them into Muslim faith schools.

Governors
 at a school in Bradford promoted an Islamic ethos by encouraging 
teachers to modify their teaching to suit Muslim students.

Minutes
 of meetings between governors at Carlton Bolling College suggest that 
boys and girls were separated during after-school workshops and some 
trips were boys-only.

Twelve teachers who tried to resist 
the implementation of the strict policies – or tried to raise the alarm –
 were made to resign and sign the gagging agreements, but Mr Mahmood 
believes there may be dozens more forced out.

A
 source from one of the schools said she knew three former teachers who 
were ‘bullied, paid, or a combination of the two’ to stay quiet.

And several of those approached by the Mail yesterday said they wanted to speak out but were unable to.

However,
 one head, Bhupinder Kondal, told Radio 4’s The World Tonight she had 
been forced out by religious conservatives at Oldknow Academy – the 
primary school revealed to have used terms such as ‘white prostitute’ to
 describe Western women in assemblies, to have taken pupils to Saudi 
Arabia and to have removed Jesus dolls from plays.

She
 said: ‘I resigned against my will. I felt that I couldn’t carry on any 
longer. I’ve been really unhappy about what I’ve gone through.’

And
 Noshaba Hussain, Muslim former head of Springfield Primary, said she 
was forced out by ‘well-organised and sinister’ extremists in 1993 and 
made to sign a gagging clause. She said: ‘The council is pretending they
 want to get to the truth but if they were sincere in that they would 
remove these gagging clauses.’

The
 DfE insisted that any gagging clauses would not prevent staff speaking 
out in the public interest, while Birmingham City Council said staff 
should feel able to ‘speak freely’. But the council did not deny it was 
telling teachers not to speak to Ofsted or the media.
