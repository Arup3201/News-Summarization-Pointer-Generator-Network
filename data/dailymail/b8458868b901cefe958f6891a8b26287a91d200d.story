Arrested: Lindsey Blansett has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of her son Caleb

A mother stabbed her 10-year-old son in the chest and beat him to death with a rock while he was in bed because she thought he 'would be better off in heaven', police have said.

Officers were called to Lindsey Nicole Blansett's home in Wellington, Kansas around 11.45pm on Sunday and when they arrived, her son Caleb was dead. She was taken into custody.

Police believe the 33-year-old mother attacked her son because she thought his life would be full of suffering, the Wellington Daily News reported.

She 'decided the boy would be better off in heaven than to face the world’s problems', according to a criminal complaint in Sumner County.

So after her son went to bed, she grabbed a knife and a rock and attacked him with both, killing him. An autopsy to determine his exact cause of death is underway.

Caleb's nine-year-old sister was also in the home at the time he was killed but she was unharmed and is now with other relatives.  

Blansett has been booked into the Sumner County Jail and has been charged with first-degree murder. Authorities say she unlawfully, intentionally and with premeditation killed her son.

She remains in jail on $500,000 bond and has an appearance scheduled in Sumner County District Court on Thursday, KAKE reported.

Scene: Her son was in bed on Sunday night when she allegedly stabbed him in the chest and beat him with a rock. Police say she thought his life would be full of suffering and wanted to save him

If convicted of first-degree murder, she faces life in prison.

Wellington Police Chief Tracy Heath said he was not aware of drugs being involved in the incident, and said are no other suspects. 

Grief counselors and crisis professionals are on hand at Lincoln Elementary School, where the 10-year-old was in the fourth grade. 

Neighbors expressed their shock, saying they never saw any signs of abuse in the home.

'Me and her talked, she was a nice lady,' neighbor Shae Hutton told KWCH. 'She didn't seem like she was capable of killing her own son.'

Friend Kayle Black, whose children played with Blansett's, added: 'He is only ten-years old, he was just a kid. As parents we are suppose to be their protectors.'
