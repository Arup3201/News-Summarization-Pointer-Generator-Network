Gluten-free products must in fact be free of wheat, rye and barley starting today - after a new Food and Drug Administration rule took effect.

The FDA rule comes amid a growing dietary trend in the U.S. in which an increasing number of people are ruling out foods that contain gluten.

Starting Tuesday, food manufacturers must make sure that their products contain less than 20 parts per million of gluten — guaranteeing
 that those products are technically free of wheat, rye and barley. That
 amount is generally recognized by the medical community to be low 
enough so that most people who have Celiac disease won't get sick if 
they eat it.

New rule: Starting Tuesday, manufacturers can only use the term 'gluten free' on a product if it contains less than 20 parts per million of gluten, ensuring that it's free of wheat, rye and barley

Until now, the term 'gluten-free' had 
not been regulated, and manufacturers made their own decisions about 
what it means. Currently, wheat must be labeled on food packages but 
barley and rye are often hidden ingredients.

The standard will ensure that companies 
can't label products 'gluten-free' if they are cross-contaminated from 
other products made in the same manufacturing facility. The rules don't 
apply to restaurants, but the Food and Drug Administration is 
encouraging them to comply.

This
 new requirement is especially important for people who suffer from 
celiac disease and don't absorb nutrients well. They can get sick from 
the gluten found in wheat and other cereal grains.

Celiac disease causes abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea, and people who have it can suffer weight loss, fatigue, rashes and other long-term medical problems. Celiac is a diagnosed illness that is more severe than gluten sensitivity, which some people self-diagnose.

Ten years ago, most people had never heard of celiac disease. But awareness and diagnosis of the illness have grown exponentially in recent years. It's not entirely clear why. Some researchers say it was underdiagnosed; others say it's because people eat more processed wheat products, such as pasta and baked goods, than in past decades, and those items use types of wheat that have a higher gluten content.

Gluten-free foods have become big business in the last several years. Millions of people are buying the foods because they say they make them feel better, even if they don't have celiac disease.

Alice Bast of the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness says the gluten-free trend has been good for those diagnosed with celiac because of the increased variety of options in the grocery store. But she said it also may have prompted some companies to lose focus on the people who need those foods the most.

The new regulations are 'raising awareness that there is a disease associated with the gluten-free diet,' Ms Bast said.

Steve Hughes, CEO of Boulder Brands, which owns leading gluten-free food companies Glutino and Udi's, says his company's products all have 10 parts per million of gluten, less than the new standard. He praises the FDA regulations for being a 'stake in the ground' that can increase the integrity of the gluten-free market.

'If consumers can't have confidence in the products long-term, it's going to hurt the overall trend,' Mr Hughes said.
