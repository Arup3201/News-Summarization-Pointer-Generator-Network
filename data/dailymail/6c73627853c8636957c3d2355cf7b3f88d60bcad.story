A Romanian man has told police his wife was the woman filmed on CCTV grabbing a startled kitten in a pet shop and bundling it into her handbag.

The man and his wife handed over the eight-week-old black and white cat, called Little Boy, who was back with its owner today unharmed.

A Romanian woman, 41, was being questioned by police today over the alleged theft - which has caused public outrage over the way the kitnapper roughly man handled the pet and forced it into a black zip-up bag.

Shocking: The woman is pictured putting the cat in her bag

Little Boy was being looked after by animal lover Carol Ivory, 62, at her  shop, Albany Pets, in Diana Street, Cardiff, when he was cruelly snatched last weekend.

It was an hour later that Carol realised Little Boy was missing and checked her CCTV.Â 

It showed young children 
picking the kitten up from its basket, where it had been sleeping, before their mother 
snatched it from them, threw it into her handbag and fled.

After CCTV footage of the theft was released, officers tracked the kitten to a property a mile away.

A shocked husband told police he believed the shoplifter to be his wife after seeing the images.

He was returned to an 'overjoyed' Carol, who said: 'I'm absolutely delighted to have him back.

'I'm so glad he's OK, I really feared
the worst, I never thought I'd see his little face again. He's going to
get so pampered and cared for now.'

She added: 'I was fearing the worst - the way she chucked it in the bag so roughly was really upsetting.

'I knew that Little Boy wouldn't be cared for properly if that's the way he will be treated. I couldn't believe my eyes when he turned up with him safe and sound.'

Carol was looking after Little Boy and his mother Felicity for a friend, who is away on a three-week holiday, when the cat snatcher struck last Saturday.

A South wales police spokesman confirmed a 41-year-old woman was being questioned over the alleged theft.

Police and the RSPCA are investigating and appealing for information about the mystery woman.

Carol said: 'I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what happened.

'The children obviously took a shine to the kitten and you can see on the film that they want it and she is going to steal it.

'But the way she chucks it in the bag so roughly is really upsetting.

'You just know that Little Boy won't be cared for and looked after properly if that's the way he will be treated.'

The woman was in a group of people who entered Carol's shop in Roath, Cardiff, at 11am last Saturday.

The shop's video shows two men, two women and three children walking around looking at the animals on display.

After three minutes and 40 seconds, one of the children is seen holding the male kitten.

One of the women takes the animal from the child and motions for the other woman to hand over her handbag, which she does.

Holding the kitten in one hand, she opens the handbag and throws the animal inside before closing it again.

The video then switches to another camera angle, overlooking the shop entrance, where the two men are standing.

About a minute later, the footage shows the women and children walking out of the shop, with one of the children holding the handbag.

One of the men pays for an item before following the rest of the group out of the shop with the other man.

Lifelong animal lover Carol only noticed the kitten was missing an hour later.

She said: 'It was the shock as much as anything - you don't think anyone would do that.

'The thought of a defenceless little kitten being with them is just horrifying.'

A reward was put up yesterday for information leading to the safe return of the kitten.

Carol added: 'He's so good and very quiet, he doesn't stand up for himself.

'What are they going to do to him if he makes a mess on the carpet out of fright?'

Carol yesterday said she was so upset she would not be renewing her licence to sell pets.

A spokeswoman said: 'We are examining 
the CCTV footage and appealing for information about the people filmed 
inside the shop at the time.'
