Tyler Blackett was sent off as Manchester United Under 21s battled to earn a 1-1 draw against Sunderland to stay top of the league.

Blackett was given his marching orders in the second half for pushing opposition player Martin Smith in the face as both players fought for the ball as Andreas Pereira prepared to take a free kick.

United also lost striker James Wilson to injury as the 19-year-old was forced off in the first half with a dead leg picked up in a challenge.

Pereira handed travelling United the lead with less than 20 minutes gone at the Stadium of Light, but Mikael Mandron was on hand to level the scores up for Sunderland.

The point was enough to ensure United stayed top of the league but their night was dealt a blow as striker Wilson was forced off with an early injury during the 1-1 draw.

Wilson had a huge hand in the opener as his first half shot was blocked before eventually falling to Pereira to turn home on what was a wet, windy and boggy Wearside.
