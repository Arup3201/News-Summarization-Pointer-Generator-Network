One of West Brom's sponsors that threatened to withdraw its support during the Nicolas Anelka "quenelle" saga earlier this year has signed a new deal with the club.

Jack Wolfskin, an outdoor clothing, footwear and equipment specialist, considered ending their sponsorship of Albion 'as one option' as the debate rumbled on during January over a controversial gesture made by Anelka during a Barclays Premier League game at West Ham in December.

Anelka was handed a five-game ban and fined £80,000 following an independent regulatory commission hearing, following which Albion immediately suspended the striker.

In March, after Anelka announced on his Twitter account he would tear up his West Brom contract, the club then issued a subsequent statement saying the 35-year-old had been sacked for 'gross misconduct'.

With the matter now laid to rest, Jack Wolfskin has agreed to a one-year extension of an agreement that started at the beginning of the 2013-14 campaign.

Albion's head of corporate sales Ian Wain said on the club's official website: 'We are delighted to extend our partnership to a second year.

'These are exciting times as the club prepares for a fifth successive season of Barclays Premier League football and it is great to have an internationally-renowned brand such as Jack Wolfskin on board.'

Jack Wolfskin CMO Elke Stein said: 'We are delighted to continue our successful partnership with Albion which will continue to increase our brand recognition in the UK alongside our other club partnerships and LED presence across the Premier League.'
