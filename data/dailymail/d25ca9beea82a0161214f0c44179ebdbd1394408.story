It might look a little bit like a novelty static caravan, but Belgian architects have managed to squeeze essential components of a normal home into a giant egg.

The pod, which measures only 215 square feet, contains a kitchen, bathroom and bedroom space in a polyester and plywood shell.

The design was originally conceived as a solution for an Italian design firm that was struggling to get planning permission for an office extension.

It might look a little bit like a novelty static caravan, but Belgian architects have managed to squeeze essential components of a normal home into a giant egg

The pod, which measures only 215 square feet, contains a kitchen, bathroom (seen at the centre of the image) and bedroom space in a polyester and plywood shell

Fully lit, the house can have a warm glow inside, which looks like a yellowy egg and has multiple openings to increase the amount of living space available

The Blob VB3 micro-house came about as the local planning authority refused to give permission for any permanent structures, which enabled quirky architectural firm dmvA to come up with its aesthetically-pleasing design that is small and mobile, Gizmodo reported.

The firms says its egg is easily transportable and can be used as an office, guestroom or garden house as the space is so flexible.

In order to squeeze the functions of a much larger home into the micro-house, the interior was designed to have lots of cubby holes to house kitchen essentials, separate the bathroom from the main space (at the pointier end of the egg) and provide space to sleep.

People who live or work in the egg can open a large upwards-lifting door or 'nose' to create a porch or canopy,Â  extending their living space.

Some of the cubbyholes are joined up to allow for people to sleep in 'bunks' alongside other holes which house their possessions

The egg-shaped micro-house measures just 215 square feet but has plenty of storage space in the form of cubby holes - that people can even sleep in

Design was dreamed up by Belgian architects dmvA as temporary office space for a client that couldn't get planning permission for an extension
