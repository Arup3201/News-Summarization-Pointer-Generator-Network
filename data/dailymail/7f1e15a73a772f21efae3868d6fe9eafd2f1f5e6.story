Jodi Arias read a number of sexual texts that she and her murdered ex Travis Alexander exchanged in the months before she killed him.

It came one day after the Phoenix, Arizona court heard a half-hour recording of the suspect having phone sex with Alexander.

Arias, 32, has admitted stabbing her on-off boyfriend 27 times before slitting his throat and shooting him in the head at his Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008. She claims that she did so in self-defense.

Cowed: Jodi Airas appeared in court on Wednesday following her phone sex tape revelations

Focused: Arias studies some information before the trial began today in Phoenix, Arizona

Defense attorneys moved to have proceedings declared a mistrial or remove the death penalty this morning in Phoenix because of 'prosecutorial misconduct' by Juan Martinez.

Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said that Martinez was getting texts from possible witnesses and friends of Alexander's who were watching the trial at home and then texting Martinez about contradictions in Arias's story.  Though Martinez did not deny that he is receiving help from potential witnesses, the judge denied the request to throw out the case.

Arias then took the stand and resumed where she had left off in the trial on Tuesday by explaining that in April 2008, she moved away from Mesa and back in with her grandparents, thousands of miles from Alexander in Yreka, California.

She describes arguing with Travis before she moved away, that he gave her two middle fingers and she drove away crying.

She told the court that she soon found out Alexander was seeing other girls at the same time as her.

Arias claims that her time in Mesa she felt suicidal and Alexander had so badly damaged her confidence that she would 'shake like a Chihuahua'.

Dressed in a black striped shirt, Arias told the court that the couple would fight via phone and text message.

Alexander threatened to tell Arias's family about all the 'psycho things that she done' which made her feel like he 'could reach through the phone and grab her'.

Arias responded by telling Alexander that she would tell 'the fact you're a pedophile with a past'.

Despite the fights, Arias said that she wished to remain friends with Alexander - and that their phone conversations would turn sexual.

She said: 'I liked it...he was very nice to me, it wasn't about the sex. They [the conversations] were explicit but still nice. I craved the nice from him.'

The defense returned to the sexual side of Arias and Alexander's relationship, focusing on text messages where he reiterated a fantasy where he wanted to zip-tie his ex-girlfriend to a tree dressed as Little Red Riding Hood and shoot amateur porn shots.

Arias read a 
number of explicit text messages that Alexander sent her when they 
carried out their secret sexual relationship.

Sexual encounters: The couple can be heard having graphic phone sex in the recording that Arias made

'You are the ultimate slut in bed,' he wrote in one instance.

'You will feel like you are being raped and enjoy every minute of it.

'You'll rejoice in being a whore, have animalistic sex with me and pleasing me in any way I desire.'

The couple's sexual history has played a pivotal role in the trial, and on Tuesday a 30-mintue recording of a phone sex conversation was played publicly.

'Confused': Arias could not offer an explanation as too why Alexander wanted her to wear boy's Spiderman underwear while they had sex (stock picture)

On
the recording from May 2008, Arias can be heard breathing deeply, 
moaning and discussing how she loves that Alexander is 'hairless and 
smooth all over'.

The 
couple discuss previous times they had sex and graphic activities where 
they would experiment with Pop Rocks and Tootsie Rolls. The pair also encourage each 
other to pleasure themselves, discuss oral sex and talk about having sex in bubble baths.

During the 30-minute conversation,

On the tape, Alexander says that Arias introduced him to lubricants and talks about her bikini waxes.

At one point, Alexander said that he wanted to 'zip tie her to a tree' before performing anal sex and videotaping the experience.

She told the court that she thought 
he was referencing an explicit scene in the film Me, Myself and Irene, 
and that even though she found the idea to be degrading, she did not 
want Alexander to think that she was criticizing his sexual fantasies.

She responds: 'It is so debasing... I like it.'

Arias
later told the court that he wanted her to dress up like Little Red 
Riding Hood while she was tied to the tree, and she connected that to 
his sexual attraction to young boys and girls which she revealed in 
court on Monday.

On the tape, Arias calls Alexander 
'superhuman' and compliments his stamina and genitals. Her lawyer later 
asked her why she made the comments and she said that it was because 
'Travis thrived on compliments'.

Shame: Jodi Arias lowered her head as she took the stand on Tuesday while the court were played a cellphone conversation of her and Travis Alexander having phone sex

Cringing: Arias covered up her face as her family and the relatives of Travis Alexander listened to the phone call which lasted more than 30 minutes

She went on to say that she faked an 
orgasm during the phone conversation- again, a move she said was 
intended to please him and keep him from switching into 'Mr Hyde'. 
Throughout the trial, she claimed that he was temperamental and had 
extreme mood swings. 

She also talked at length about how she 
had to buy KY lubricant so that they could use it during 'all kinds of 
sex except oral' since he ran out of the previous brand that he used. 
She said she was unhappy with his decision to use Vaseline when they ran
out and that he refused to buy more 'because he refused to be seen in 
public using personal lubricant'.

Travis
Alexander's sisters and brother, who have regularly appeared in court, 
grimaced but remained expressionless as the lengthy recording played.

The
explosive developments on Tuesday came after Arias told the court the 
day before that months before she stabbed him to death, she caught her 
boyfriend Travis Alexander pleasuring himself while looking at pictures 
of young boys.

That 
admission came nearly a year after he had given her a packet of boy’s 
Spiderman underwear for Valentine's Day, saying that he found it 'hot' 
when she wore them during anal sex.

Happier times: Arias is accused of stabbing and shooting Travis Alexander in his Mesa home in 2008

Harrowing: The siblings of Travis Alexander listen in court as they hear their late brother's voice on tape

Disbelief: Travis' sisters and his friend looked incredulous as Arias told the court about his alleged 'deviant' interests

‘He preferred sex with women, it made him feel normal, more normal,’ she told the court.

‘It's hard to describe this. It’s very
embarrassing. He seemed very ashamed with himself and he didn’t want to
be that way it was something he struggled with. It’s not who he wanted 
to be its not who he wanted to be in the future... when he had sex with 
women he felt more normal and it was preferable to his other deviant 
urges, I guess you could say.’

Since Arias has claimed that she 
killed the then-30-year-old man in self defense, the attorney is likely 
using her time on the stand to paint a picture of a battered woman who 
felt compelled to return to a complex relationship.

The prosecution claims she carried out a pre-planned attack as she was jealous of his relationships with other women. If she is convicted, she faces the death penalty.

She initially claimed she had nothing to
do with the attack, before changing her story to say she watched two 
people kill Alexander before finally settling on self defense.

Strain: Jodi Arias' mother and father have been in court throughout the trial

Throughout the trial, Arias has 
differentiated between vaginal and anal sex, because she believed that 
vaginal sex went against her Mormon vow of chastity before marriage, 
while anal and oral sex qualified as a ‘grey area.’

Arias also told the packed court room 
that Alexander had a violent temper.

On Monday she specified that he had
been physically violent with her on at least four different occasions, 
either grabbing her wrists or slamming her onto the bed during an 
argument.

The most extreme of those cases ended 
with her on the floor as he allegedly kicked her in the ribs and hurt 
her finger. She said that rather than seek medical treatment for the 
finger, which she believes was broken, they made a makeshift splint. In 
court, she held up her hand to show how it is bent even today.
