Ralph Tarrant has just taken the title of Britain's oldest man - but says he doesn't understand what 'all this fuss is about'.

The Sheffield great great grandfather has been handed the crown following the death of 110-year-old Reg Dean yesterday.

Aged 109 and 185 days old, Mr Tarrant was born only a year after Mr Dean in 1903.

He was one half of Britain's oldest married couple until his wife Phyllis died aged 102 last year.

And Mr Tarrant says the secret to a long life is to enjoy vices as well as much as virtues.

'Stay active and stay interested,' he said.

'There's no need to live too carefully I smoked until I was 70 and I still enjoy a drink. I have a sweet tooth too and my 
favourite meal is cottage pie which I make myself.'

Both Mr Dean and Mr Tarrant lived through two world wars and saw 24 prime ministers come and go.

A former church minister, Mr Dean put his long life down to a mysterious elixir he was once given by a physician in India.

'He said, "If you drink this you will live for ever" â€“ and this is the result," he told the Derbyshire Times last year.

But Mr Tarrant, a former insurance man, who retired in 1968, credits simpler pleasures for his longevity.

He said: 'I am old but it isn't that 
hard, I still live independently I do my own shopping and I enjoy 
cooking. I go out walking when I can so what's the big deal?

'I
 just don't understand all this fuss about getting old. I feel really 
smashing for my age.My health is good. The only thing is I have 
recently started using a walking stick - but I can still go like the 
clappers.'

Mr Tarrant was born in Nottingham on 
July 7th 1903, and moved to Sheffield when he was seven. He left school 
at 13 and started work as an office boy at a local steelworks. 

He
 moved around different departments , became a steel inspector and 
served as a corporal in the RAF during the war before selling insurance 
with Refuge Assurance until he retired in 1968.

Mr
 Tarrant met his wife Phyllis in 1922 and they married in Crookes , 
Sheffield, 11 years later, the day after Ralph's 30th birthday.

Between them, Ralph and Phyllis Tarrant had received a total of ten cards from the Queen and were as devoted to each other as ever before Phyllis died last year. 

'The key to a long 
and happy marriage is to give each other hell every chance you get! 
That's certainly what we did and it kept us young, we were great 
friends,' he said.

History maker: Ralph Tarrant is now Britain's oldest man aged 109. He was previously one half of Britain's oldest married couple before his wife Phyllis died last year aged 102

The couple visited the USA eight times, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Hitler's 
hideaway in Austria and even danced under the stars on a cruise around 
the Greek islands.

'I
 sometimes feel that we didn't really start living until we retired in 
our sixties and went off travelling round the world. We did more in our 
later years than we ever had the opportunity to do when we were young.

'Capri was my absolute favourite that's where we ended up swimming with Gracie Fields,' he said.

Mr Tarrant has two daughters, Brenda and Christine, seven grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren and two great great grandchildren.
