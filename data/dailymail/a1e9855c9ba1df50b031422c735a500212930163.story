New homeowners in a single suburban street have paid the government more than £1million in stamp duty in just two years.

Analysis of sold house prices on Hillier Road in Wandsworth, south London shows the Exchequer has collected an estimated £1,048,518 from the most recent 16 sales alone.

The figures come on the same day it was revealed that renting a home is now significantly cheaper than buying one thanks to the non-stop house price boom, with the gap continuing to grow between monthly rental payments and mortgage costs in recent months.

Expensive street: The property sales on Hillier Road took place between September 2011 and January this year, with all but two falling into the five per cent stamp duty threshold. The average sum levied on a transaction was £65,532, with the properties purchased ranging from a two bedroom flat to five-bedroom terraced houses

The property sales on Hillier Road took place between 
September 2011 and January this year, with all but two falling into the five
 per cent stamp duty threshold.

The average sum levied on a transaction was £65,532, with the properties purchased ranging from a two bedroom flat to five-bedroom terraced houses.

The highest bill was the estimated £99,970 thought to have been paid by the new owners of 52 Hillier Road when they bought the three-bedroom property for £1,999,408 last December.

The lowest stamp duty bill is believed to be the estimated £23,450 paid on 63b Hillier Road - a two-bedroom flat which sold for £557,000 in October 2011.

That property changed hands again in November last year for £699,950, with its stamp duty rising to an estimated £27,998.

The Hillier Road figures emerged as it was revealed that for every £1
 spent by a homeowner on repaying the mortgage, a renter in an 
equivalent property pays just 93p.

Just
 one year ago, renters were paying only four per cent less than 
homeowners, but as house prices have continued to soar buying a home has
 become increasingly unaffordable.

Housing: The lowest stamp duty bill on Hillier Road in the last two years is believed to be the estimated £23,450 paid on 63b Hillier Road (pictured left) - a two-bedroom flat which sold for £557,000 in October 2011. That property changed hands again in November last year for £699,950, with its stamp duty rising to an estimated £27,998

Another Hillier Road property - the three-bedroom terraced house at number 55 - was also sold twice during the period in which the data was gathered.

It fetched
 £990,000 in January 2012, when its stamp duty was an estimated £39,600.
 By November that year, the price tag had risen to £1.79million and the 
tax bill to £89,750.

Property website Zoopla estimates the current value of the house to be £2,193,939 - meaning it would cost a buyer an extra £153,575 in stamp duty.

The
 figures for Hillier Road emerged following 
revelations that new homeowners shelled out £10billion in stamp duty in a single year.

The Office for Budget Responsibility said the property tax bill has risen 40 per cent since March 2013.

The
 government is facing growing calls for the tax - which was introduced 
in 2003 - to be reformed. Critics argue it puts people off buying 
properties.

Rising: The Hillier Road figures emerged after it was revealed that for every £1 spent by a homeowner on repaying the mortgage, a renter in an equivalent property pays just 93p. Just one year ago, renters were paying only four per cent less than homeowners, but as house prices soar buying has become increasingly unaffordable

Anger: The government is facing growing calls for stamp duty - which was introduced in 2003 - to be reformed. Critics argue it puts people off buying properties. Stamp duty starts at 1 per cent for those paying between £125,001 and £250,000, and rises 7 per cent for homes costing more than £2million

Ministers are also under pressure to tackle the housing bubble, which has put home ownership increasingly out of reach of millions of Britons.

The price of the average home in the UK has risen by 11 per cent over the past year, to a new high of £260,000.

By
 contrast, the cost of renting rose by 3.7 per cent in the year to 
April, according to figures from property firm Countrywide.

Across the nation, the average monthly rent stands at £873, up from £837 a year ago.

The
 company says that for every £1 of mortgage repayments by a homeowner 
with a 10 per cent deposit, the average renter has to pay only 93p.

That gap is even wider in London, epicentre of the housing boom, where renters pay just 86p compared to mortgage repayments.

Stamp duty starts at 1 per cent for those paying between £125,001 and £250,000, and rises to seven per cent for homes costing more than £2million.

Buyers are charged three per cent of the price when paying between £250,001 and £500,000 for a property.

A four per cent tax is levied on homes fetching between £250,001 and £500,000, rising to 5 per cent for properties bought for more £1million and up to £2million.

The UK house price bubble is continuing to cause concern for for homeowners, with the cost of buying a property rising at its fastest rate for nearly seven years.

The average home now costs nearly £18,000 more than it did last year, with house prices jumped by 11 per cent year-on-year. This is the first time that annual house price inflation has been in double figures since 2010, and the highest rate since June 2007.

Ministers are now under pressure to tackle the bubble, which is putting home ownership increasingly out of the reach of millions.

Earlier this month Robert Gardner, chief economist at the Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, warned of the ‘wide margin’ between the rate at which house prices are rising and people’s pay rises.

Bubble: Figures from the Office of National statistics show that house prices have increased by 10.9 percent over the past year

The average worker with a full-time job earns around £27,000, but the average house price has jumped to £183,577, which is nearly seven times higher than their salary.

Official figures, from the Office for National Statistics, reveal the average pay rises is currently 1.7 per cent a year, compared to house price growth of 10.9 per cent a year. As a result, people’s pay is barely moving but house prices are rising rapidly.

The luxury housing market is also hit by the bubble.

Last month the property company owned by the Duke of Westminster has sold off £240million of luxury homes in central London amid fears the capital's house price bubble may be about the burst.

Grosvenor Group said it was cutting its exposure to high-end residential properties after growing concerned that the rate of growth in the London luxury house price market was unsustainable.
