Hobby: Paul Smith's 10-year habit of making DIY bombs in a workshop at his parent's house in East Hull came to an end in April when neighbours got sick of his explosions setting off their car alarms

An electrician gave a whole new meaning to DIY by building and setting off homemade bombs as a hobby, a court heard yesterday.

Paul Smith was so obsessed with constructing explosive devices from a workshop at his parents’ house that his family gave him a birthday cake in the shape of a bomb.

It carried the message: ‘Paul 40 today. Hope it goes with a bang.’

However, neighbours got so fed up with him setting off explosions that they complained to police. One explosion in Smith’s back garden set off all the local car alarms.

Officers raided the home and found a huge collection of bomb-making equipment, Hull Crown Court was told. It included material of the type used by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Smith told officers he was not a terrorist or fanatic, but made the devices as a hobby for fun. He told police: 'I don’t know what all the fuss is about. Everyone knows I make small bombs. Some people collect stamps, I make small bombs.'

He learned his skills from the internet and spent the past ten years making increasingly sophisticated bombs, the court heard. Some parts were made from household objects, such as a lunchbox which was turned into a remote-controlled detonator.

He also collected gunpowder from unexploded bombs found in eroding cliffs on the East Yorkshire coast.

Recognition: Unemployed drug user Smith set off so many of his homemade devices that this year his family bought him a bomb-shaped cake for his 40th birthday

In his workshop police found two live 
pipe bombs and 20 to 30 detonators as well as shotgun cartridges, 9mm 
bullets and gunpowder.

Prosecutor Richard Woolfall said 
chemicals including sulphur, iron oxide and magnesium were held in 
storage jars on the shelves. He added: 'There was a mixture of sugar and
aluminium of the type used in Northern Ireland and by the Taliban in 
Afghanistan.'

An Army bomb disposal team was called in to make the home safe.

David Gordon, defending, said Smith was 'a somewhat naive 40-year-old'.

Serious: Police uncovered two live pipe bombs, 20-30 detonators, two battery packs and a sophisticated halogen light operating trigger at Smith's bomb-making workshop

Collection: Police also found a series of home-made detonators and a stock-pile of scaffolding tubing, 10 shotgun cartridges, a hoard of 9mm bullets and a store of gun-powder in the raid

He added: 'He has been in custody now 
for five months and does not find it at all pleasurable. He is not a 
terrorist. He does not have any radical religious or political opinions.
He does have an unhealthy interest in explosive devices.'

Smith, of Hull, pleaded guilty to 
making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances and 
another charge of possession of a class B drug. The court heard he had 
lost his job and had taken to injecting amphetamines, to which he was 
addicted.

Dangerous: Chemicals including sulphur, iron oxide and magnesium were held in storage jars on the shelves and a pestle and mortar had been used to mix gunpowder

'Some people collect stamps I make small bombs': Hull Crown Court heard Smith had lost his job as an electrician and had taken to injecting amphetamine

He was given a 15-month supervision 
order, with a drug rehabilitation programme and 150 hours' unpaid work. A
ten-year anti-social behaviour order was also imposed, banning him from
possession of flares or fireworks which are not commercially available.
