Ex-BBC boss Mark Thompson was dramatically accused of misleading MPs yesterday over a doomed computer project which cost licence fee payers £100million.

The former director general was said by a senior Labour backbencher to have failed to ‘tell the truth’ about the Digital Media Initiative, which was scrapped last month after the corporation admitted it was ‘throwing good money after bad’.

Yesterday the BBC Trust member who was supposed to oversee the project suggested there had been a failure to admit to the fiasco because of a belief that the corporation ‘could walk on water’.

BBC Director General Mark Thompson may be summoned to Westminster to answer questions over the DMI fiasco

Anthony Fry branded DMI a ‘complete catastrophe’ and ‘probably the most, seriously embarrassing thing I have ever seen’.

Mr Thompson could be summoned from his new job at the New York Times to answer questions in Westminster about evidence he gave to a Parliamentary committee two years ago.

It is claimed he said then that ‘DMI is out in the business’, adding that there were many programmes being made using it and it was ‘already working’.

He left the BBC last year and was replaced by George Entwistle. Mr Entwistle quit in November and it was his successor, Lord Hall, who scrapped DMI last month.

The revelations emerged during a Public Accounts Committee hearing in Salford yesterday. Mr Fry said the BBC continued to defend the disastrous project at a time when there was a feeling that the corporation could ‘walk on water’ following the success of the iPlayer and the Olympics.

The five-year DMI project was supposed to allow BBC staff to access its audio and video archive from computers instead of transporting tapes between offices.

'Embarrassing': BBC Trust member Anthony Fry branded the DMI project a 'complete catastrophe

Referring to Mr Thompson’s evidence in 2011, Margaret Hodge, the Public Accounts Committee chairman, said: ‘The thing that really shook me was we were told there were bits of the system working, you were using and running programmes with them – that wasn’t true. It just wasn’t true.’

Tory MP Stewart Jackson said he now felt embarrassed to read a press release from the committee in 2011 which had praised the BBC handling of DMI. ‘That shows the extent to which we were misled,’ he said.

The corporation has already suspended one executive, chief technology officer John Linwood who was hired from Yahoo! on a salary of £280,000 a year, but MPs have suggested others should also be held accountable.

BBC trustee Mr Fry told MPs: ‘If I was in your shoes I would not just feel furious on behalf of licence fee payers, which I do very strongly, but I also feel you went out there with a report that was very favourable to this [DMI].’ He admitted everyone thought DMI was going to work ‘not least because of the comments made by Mr Thompson’.

The hearing was also told that concerns made by whistleblower Bill Garrett in a letter sent to BBC chairman Lord Patten in 2012 were not examined properly.

Mr Garrett said he believed the Trust, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the PAC ‘may have been misled’ and that a previous National Audit Office report had provided ‘false confidence’ in the progress of DMI.

Accountants Price Waterhouse are to carry out a review for the BBC Trust into the fiasco. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC takes seriously its responsibility to provide the NAO and Public Accounts Committee with the most accurate information at all times. As has been made clear, the BBC will now be doing all it can to assist the independent review of the DMI project.’

Mr Thompson said last night: ‘When I appeared in front of the PAC, I answered all of the questions from committee members honestly and in good faith. I did so on the basis of information provided to me at the time by the BBC executives responsible for delivering the project.’
