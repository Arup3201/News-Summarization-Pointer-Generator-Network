A 10-year-old Indian boy in Mexico was heartlessly humiliated by a city inspector for selling cigarettes, candy and snacks on the street.

The inspector, Juan Diego Lopez, caught Manuel Diaz Hernandez illegally selling cigarettes, candy and snacks Monday from a wooden basket in Villahermosa, Mexico - the capitol city of the Gulf state of Tabasco.

In a video captured by witnesses, the inspector grabs the basket and makes the boy throw out all the candy before swiping the cigarettes himself.

Unnecessary: An inspector targeted the Tzotzil Indian boy, Manuel Diaz Hernandez, for illegally selling cigarettes

Waste: The inspector made Hernandez empty all of his candy onto the street

Defeated: After the inspector leaves, the boy hunches over sobbing since he just lost what equates to a week's worth of work.

Hernandez cries throughout the whole process, and once the inspector leaves, he slumps to the ground with his head in his hands, rocking back and forth while sobbing. The amount of cigarettes and candy he lost equates to about a week's worth of work, according to the AP.

Meanwhile another man steps forward to help the boy recollect the candy.

According to Hernandez's aunt, the boy had came to Villahermosa about 10 days prior from his home in the Tzotzil Indian village of San Juan Chamula in the Chiapas state where he lives with his grandparents.

He planned to spend the summer with his aunt selling goods on the street to save money for school.

While Mexican children get their textbooks for free, they have usually have to provide their own pencils, paper and uniforms.

After the incident the video was posted online and in just one week the story went viral, one video getting over a million views, which has caused an outpouring of support for the targeted boy.

On Wednesday the city announced that they had fired Lopez. While it was illegal for the underage boy to be selling cigarettes, they agreed that the punishment was out of line - especially considering his native people were enslaved in the region until a century ago.Â 

Then the governor of Tabasco, Arturo Nunez, said that he would be giving the boy 'a scholarship as well as all medical and psychological help' in an announcement Thursday.

Lupita Santiago, a spokesman for the Chiapas state child welfare agency, also vouched to provide Hernandez with 'all necessary help.'

She said that Hernandez speaks only limited Spanish, and while his age is listed as 10, he could be older since many in his community wait to register births.

On Friday the National Human Rights Commission said it would investigate the incident.

'Any form of violence against children is totally unacceptable, especially when directed against Indians, who are the most vulnerable groups in the country,' the commission said in a statement.

Since the incident, the boy has gone back home to Chiapas, where Santiago said he is going well.
