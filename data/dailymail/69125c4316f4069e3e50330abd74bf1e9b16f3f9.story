Mealtime favourite HP Sauce has beaten products including Marmite and tomato ketchup to be named the bran that Britons have the greatest 'emotional connection' with, according to a new study.

The nation has a greater affinity to the famous brown sauce than anything else bought from supermarket shelves.

Marmite, Heinz Tomato Ketchup and treats 
such as Jaffa Cakes and Ribena also made the top ten in a list compiled 
from a survey of 5,000 shoppers.

Best of British: HP Sauce has beaten products including Marmite and tomato ketchup to be named the bran that Britons have the greatest 'emotional connection' with

Instead of simply asking which products they bought, advertising agency Leo Burnett asked shoppers about brands they had an affinity to, trusted the most and felt an emotional connection with.

HP, the brown sauce with the familiar picture of the Palace of Westminster on the label, topped the list.

It was first made in Nottingham by  grocer Frederick Gibson Garton in the late 19th century using a combination of malt vinegar, spices and dates as a spicy accessory to meals. The HP name was registered in 1895.

Love it or hate it: More people are fans of Marmite than not, as the condiment came second in the list of brands

Popular: Heinz Tomato Ketchup also won a place in the top ten, after 5,000 shoppers were quizzed on their favourite brands

1. HP Sauce

2. Marmite

3. Heinz Tomato Ketchup

4. Ribena juice drink

5. Jaffa Cakes

6. Ben & Jerry's ice cream

7. Cadbury's Dairy Milk

8. Schweppes

9. Heinz Salad Cream

10. Lurpak 

Mr Garton called his new sauce HP because he had heard that a restaurant in the Houses of Parliament had begun serving it.

Now owned by Heinz, the sauce is a favourite with fried breakfasts, bacon butties and sausage rolls though, like Marmite in second place on the list, often divides opinion.

Leo Burnett head of insights Mike Treharne said Britons felt a 'brand empathy' to the product but also appreciated its taste - the feelings are more than loyalty for loyalty's sake.

'Popular brands have a DNA which, if decoded, can be identifed, replicated and accelerated,' he said.

'Affinity is measured by customer responses such as trust, having an emotional connection, brand empathy and appreciation of quality.'

Giles Jepson, VP marketing for Heinz Europe, added: 'The Heinz brand has meaning beyond the product.

'Trust and being 'in touch with what I want' are both key elements that support its popularity.

'We know that our brand has a trong consumer reputation which we continue to build on via communications by deepening our emotional connections, reflecting how we are part of the fabric of people's lives.'
