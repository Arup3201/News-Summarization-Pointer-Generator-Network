Inquest: Paul Dalling brewed the deadly concoction using poppy seeds thinking it would produce a 'pleasant' drowsy effect

A man died after drinking homemade poppy tea using a recipe he found online, an inquest heard.

Paul Dalling, 27, brewed the deadly concoction using poppy seeds, thinking the drink would induce a pleasant drowsy effect.

But the DJ, of Milford Haven, west Wales, died when his central nervous system shut down after he consumed a pint of the tea.

A coroner warned others of the dangers of making 'poppy tea' - infamously drank in opium dens.

Pembrokeshire Coroner Mark Layton said: 'Drinking poppy tea is potentially fatal.

'It is impossible to gauge the dosage as the strength varies from plant to plant.'

Mr Dalling and his friends made a tea with crushed poppy seeds using a recipe they found on the internet.

Although it is unknown which recipe they used, there are dozens of online blogs and websites advising how to make the dangerous concoction.

Many recipes use supermarkets' own brands of poppy seeds, which can be found in ordinary food products, including bread, biscuits and cakes.

The inquest heard Mr Dalling drank the tea and smoked cannabis before going for a night out with friends.

He returned the his home, where he lived with his partner and her young child.

Dyfed-Powys Police coroner’s officer Jeremy Davies said: 'While in bed, Mr Dalling was coughing and felt hot to touch but was not in a state which caused alarm.

'But his partner was then unable to wake him and there was blood around his nose and mouth so she called the emergency services.

Poppy tea is a herbal infusion brewed from poppy straw or seeds.

Side effects include drowsiness, stomach ache, lethargy, urinary retention, constipation, and nausea.

At higher doses, it becomes dangerous and can cause death through factors like respiratory arrest or inhalation of vomit.

Frequent users can become dependent  and withdrawal can cause cramps, insomnia, craving, lethargy and mental problems.

There
 have been a number of deaths reported from the drinking of poppy tea, 
including a teenager from Nova Scotia and a young Tasmanian man, both in
 2012.

'The ambulance centre talked her through CPR but Mr Dalling was pronounced dead at home.'

A post-mortem found levels of morphine and codeine - both present in poppy tea - in Paul’s body.

Mr Dalling, described by friends as a 'a lovely guy,' enjoyed going to festivals and listening to drum and bass music.

Mr Layton ruled that his death was drugs-related.

The tragedy happened just four years after another man from Milford Haven died from drinking 'poppy tea'.

Tristan Roberts, 28, overdosed on morphine after drinking three cups of the tea to calm him before bed.

At the time his mother Sabine said: 'I think that there are quite a few people who think that anything that is really natural must be safe or must be a good thing.

'But that is not the case and people need to be made aware of that - this is something that is almost completely unknown.'
