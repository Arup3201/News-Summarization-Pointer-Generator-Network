She may be taller than the average woman at 5ft 8in but the Duchess of York looked minuscule as she posed for a selfie with two of her biggest fans in New York yesterday.

Prince Andrew's former wife was stopped by identical twins Mike and Ray, who rap under the name the Filthy Brothers and The Twin Towers, outside the studios of radio station SiriusXM in uptown Manhattan and smiled as one of her admirers took an opportunistic photo. 

The rappers later posted a picture of them and the Duchess on their own Twitter account.  

Wearing a black trench coat, sunglasses, black tights, and black flat shoes, the duchess seemed content to be out and about in a city which has become a second home to her in recent months.

Her biggest fans: Prince Andrew's former wife, the Duchess of York, was stopped by the two towering men outside the studio of radio station SiriusXM in uptown Manhattan 

The Filthy brothers were quick to publish a picture of them and the Duchess of York on their Twitter account

Known in the US by her maiden name Sarah Ferguson, she has been a regular face in the city since her daughter Princess Eugenie landed a job at New York-based online art auction house, Paddle8, in September.

This week, she appeared on American television promoting her soup diet while also speaking up in defence of former husband Prince Andrew following lurid claims he slept with an underage sex slave.

Yesterday the duchess was facing criticism after linking a top university to her controversial diet plan while she was endorsing it on American television.

Ms Ferguson claims to have lost 4st thanks to a £65 blender which turns fruit and vegetables into smoothies and soup.

In an interview promoting the product on morning TV, she said that she had been motivated to help beat obesity by her work with Imperial College London, one of the world's most prestigious scientific institutions.

But the university has been quick to distance itself from the duchess' claims - saying that her commercial projects 'are not connected in any way' to its research, The Times reported.

Experts said they were sceptical about the benefits of her diet plan, casting doubt on the nutritional benefits claimed to come from using the 'emulsifier' which she has promoted in a half-hour 'infomercial' as well as in multiple TV interviews.

The duchess has been outspoken about her battle with her weight since divorcing her husband in 1996 and is said to have been paid £1.4million a year as the face of Weight Watchers.

Ms Ferguson also spoke up in defence of ex-husband Prince Andrew, describing him as a 'humongously good man' and 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever'.

The Prince has come under fire over his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with an underage girl.

Buckingham Palace has issued a statement strongly denying the allegations, which Ms Ferguson, 55, repeated during an interview with NBC News.

'I won't stand by - because I know what it feels like to have salacious lies made up about you - and not support him so publicly,' she told Matt Lauer.

She said the claims against her former husband were 'shockingly accusatory allegations which I don't think are right'.

'I won't stand by and have his character defamed,' she said. 'I will not have one word said about him on any level. Any level.'

The pair, who divorced in 1996 after 10 years of marriage, remain good friends, she said. They have two daughters together, Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24.
