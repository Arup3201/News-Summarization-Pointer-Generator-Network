Residues of toxic chemicals have been found in children’s clothes and shoes made by major brands including Disney, Burberry, American Apparel, GAP and Primark.

The products involved include items sold in the UK, according to research by Greenpeace.

There is no evidence that the levels of chemicals found would cause harm to children wearing them, however Greenpeace argues they should be removed on a precautionary basis.

Higher levels were found in products from Disney, Burberry, American Apparel and C&A

It is particularly concerned for the health of workers involved in making the products in countries stretching from China to Italy, Tunisia and the U.S.

Eighty-two items of children’s clothing from 25 countries around the world were sent to research laboratories at the University of Exeter, who co-ordinated the testing.

Residues were found in all but six, according to a research report titled ‘A little story about the monsters in your closet’, which was published today.

Three out of four items bought in the UK contained chemical residues, including a hooded sweatshirt from American Apparel, a shirt from Burberry and sweatpants from Primark.

Also a Chelsea children’s football sale in Colombia was found to contain traces of a suspect chemical.

The chemicals highlighted by the group include Nonylphenol ethoxylates(NPEs), which were detected in 50 of the products. 

Higher levels were found in products from Disney, Burberry, American Apparel and C&A. These are said to have the potential to accumulate in the body and disrupt hormones.

The tests ound phthalates, which are used to soften plastics, in many products. These have been at the centre of controversy over suggestions they can disrupt the hormones of developing children.

Also found were Per and poly-flurinated(PFOAs) chemicals, which are said to have an impact on the reproductive and immune systems. Animal tests have identified them as a potential cancer risk.

One Adidas swimsuit contained higher levels of PFOAs than permitted in the company’s own Restricted Substance List, while printed fabric on a Primark children’s T-shirt contained a high phthalate reading.

Antimony, which has many similarities to arsenic, was found in some garments. It is known to trigger dermatitis and breathing problems.

Primark said it is working to remove chemicals from the production process

Fungicide chemicals, known as organotoxins, were found in socks, shoes and sports clothes.

Exposure at high levels can harm the immune and nervous systems.

Chih An Lee, Detox Campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia, said: ‘This is a nightmare for parents everywhere looking to buy clothes for their children that don’t contain hazardous chemicals. 

‘These chemical ‘little monsters’ can be found in everything from exclusive luxury designs to budget fashion, polluting our waterways from Beijing to Berlin. For the sake of current and future generations brands should stop using these monsters.’

An Lee said: ‘Parents, fashion fans and local communities can help end this toxic nightmare by speaking out against polluting brands.

‘Thanks to global people power, some of the world’s biggest brands have already committed to detox and many of them are already walking the talk towards supply chain transparency and the elimination of the worst chemicals.’

The retailers insisted that the chemical levels found were at such a low level that they do not pose a risk to customers.

Burberry said it is working with Greenpeace to tackle the issue. A spokesman said: ‘The safety and welfare of our customers is paramount and Burberry complies with all international environmental and safety standards. Burberry products do not pose a danger to customers.’

Primark said it is working to remove chemicals from the production process.

It said: ‘We have a stringent chemical management policy in place which complies fully with EU legislation. 

‘However, Primark has long recognised the importance of continuing to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing processes.’

Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium said: ‘Members providing  children’s clothing are ensuring that products meet and exceed current legal requirements. 

‘We have not seen the full data but looking at the text in the executive summary there are some concerns, especially that the report does not highlight any instances of products on sale which are illegal. 

‘Current chemical test methods are very sophisticated and can detect chemicals at extremely low levels so, although detected, this does not mean that the chemicals would cause health problems to children and may only be present  as very low level contaminants.’
