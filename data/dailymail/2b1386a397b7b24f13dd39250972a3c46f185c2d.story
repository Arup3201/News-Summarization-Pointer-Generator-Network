North Korea has opened a firing range where families can shoot live pheasants and chickens and take home the carcasses to cook for dinner.

In a country where observers say thousands of people are starving to death, the Meari shooting gallery re-opened last month in the capital Pyongyang after a major revamp.

It boasts a 25-metre pistol range, a 50-metre rifle range and even an archery ground in Pyongyang's 'new sports district'.

North Korea's state media outlet also claims the gallery has a shooting range for ray guns, which exist chiefly in science fiction films.

Grandmothers and young children were pictured today donning goggles and honing their skills at the state-of-the-art facility - which includes an outdoor range with live birds in a large cage.

Shooters are handed high marks when they do well, while children are given target practice by using electronic guns at a centre which also claims to have tennis, badminton and volleyball courts.

The shooting gallery is even publicised by several Western tour agencies, one of which charges $2,695 for a heavily-chaperoned seven day trip around the autocratic state.

Another claims rifle and revolver practice costs 50 U.S. cents per bullet or 25 cents per arrow - with a 20 Euro charge for those who want to take a pheasant carcass home.

The state-run Korean Central News 
Agency last month publicised the bizarre attraction with several quotes 
from visitors apparently singing the praises of supreme leader Kim Jong 
Un.

Pak
 Nam Song, a student of the Hanggu Senior Secondary School in Hanggu 
District, Nampho City, was quoted as claiming he felt like a master shot when aiming at wild animals displayed on screen.

'I will study harder in the future to repay the loving care shown by the respected Marshal Kim Jong Un,' he added.

And an employee, Song
 Yon Hyang, said one foreign visitor 'told her he was deeply moved by the loving care shown by 
Marshal Kim Jong Un for the people', according to the state-run agency.

Much
 of North Korea remains off-limits to foreigners, but Pyongyang, with 
its broad avenues, plazas and monuments, is more accessible than other 
places in the secretive and isolated country.

On Sunday foreigners were allowed for 
the first time to compete in the Pyongyang marathon as thousands of 
spectators were pictured cheering and whooping from the sidelines.

'Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has seen the expansion and development of amusement parks and its first ever water park including a dolphin circus'

- Prof Charles Armstrong, Columbia University

Professor Charles Armstrong, a world-renowned expert on North Korea at Columbia University in New York, told MailOnline: 'Koreans North and South certainly have a macho culture, and of course citizens who are taught that a war with the U.S. could break out at any moment would be encouraged to engage in lots of shooting practice.

'But this is also part of a general trend in North Korea towards more entertainment for the people, at least the relatively privileged ones in Pyongyang and other cities.

'Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has seen the expansion and development of amusement parks, and its first ever water park including a dolphin circus.'

But James Hoare, the former British ambassador to North Korea who helped found the embassy in Pyongyang, told MailOnline: 'I have actually been to the gallery - the only time I have ever fired a gun, and cut myself so we stopped.

'It is really just another sports facility dating from the 1980s and not particularly sinister in my view - nor from my one experience, very heavily used.'

The publicity around the shooting 
gallery comes just weeks after a UN report condemned what it said was mass 
starvation and public executions under North Korea's totalitarian 
regime.

The report - which took a year to compile - found crimes against humanity had been committed with people sent to political prison camps, tortured and sometimes executed without trial.

It added: 'The gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.'

Michael Kirby, chairman of the UN's Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea, said last month: 'At the end of the Second World War so many people said "If only we had knownâ€¦ if only we had known the wrongs that were done in the countries of the hostile forces.

'Well, now the international community does know. There will be no excusing of failure of action because we didn't know.'
