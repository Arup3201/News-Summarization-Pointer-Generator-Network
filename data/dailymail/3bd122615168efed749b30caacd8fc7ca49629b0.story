Germany is about to start a high-tech - and high altitude - hunt for graffiti vandals using pilotless drones of the sort used by western forces to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Instead of a warhead the Deutsche Bahn drones will be equipped with cameras to catch out the vandals costing the national railway company over six million pound costs in the annual clean up of graffiti.

Most graffiti is sprayed at night so the plan calls for the drones to carry infra red cameras which will pick out the vandals at work.

Vandals: Graffiti artists have been targeted Deutsche Bahn train terminals at night

Testing is due to take place at particularly badly hit depots and marshalling yards where trains are parked in a pristine condition at nightfall only to be covered in unwanted 'art' come sunrise.

Strict anti-surveillance and privacy in laws may yet challenge Deutsche Bahn's programme.

Internet giant Google was forced to give people an opt out from their Street View service when a huge outcry followed its inception.

But Deutsche Ban insists that only people found on its property would be targeted by the cameras.

The idea behind the drones comes from years of frustrating cat-and-mouse games with vandals across railyards and depots.

'We have to find news ways to wage the anti-graffiti struggle,' said the head of railways security Gerd Neubeck.

A black box recorder on the drones would accurately pinpoint where the graffiti is taking place to be able to allow for successful prosecutions once vandals are identified.

The high-tech 'Tracker' drones will be painted in the red and black of German Railways. They can fly nearly 500 feet high at nearly 30 mph for 80 minutes at a stretch.

Drones: The unmanned aircraft are more usually used in warfare

They cost Â£50,000 and will be controlled from a central command post.

Deutsche Bahn's planned deployment comes just weeks after the German government halted an expensive project to build its own military drone called Euro Hawk because of mounting costs.

Deutsche Bahn belives that its Tracker squadron may also prove useful in identifying where bridges and long track stretches that need extra maintenance.

Drones are used by Western forces in Afghanistan to target Taliban forces.

The US is also carrying out a highly controversial a drone programme to target suspected terrorists in Pakistan.

Many Pakistanis see it as an infringement on their sovereignty and complain that innocent civilians have also been killed, something the US rejects.Islamabad officially opposes the use of US drones on its territory, but is believed to have tacitly approved some strikes in past.
