Francesca Versace, the 32-year-old niece of Donatella Versace, is expecting her first child.

The London-based fashion designer, whose father is Santo Versace, the oldest brother of Donatella and the late Gianni Versace, told Vogue.co.uk that she has been 'really enjoying the mid stages of my pregnancy', from keeping in shape with swimming and yoga to experimenting with maternity wear.

One thing she refuses to give up, however, are high heels, 'although I have opted for more comfy mid-heel versions for practicality, like Nicholas Kirkwood's silver pointed ones!' she said.

Upbringing: Francesca (pictured with Donatella in September 2010) was born and raised in Milan. She studied Fashion Design and Marketing at London's Central Saint Martins, graduating in 2006

Francesca, who was born and raised in Milan, now lives in London with her boyfriend, 29-year-old Cristopher Meireles Leoni, a Brazilian model and actor.

She studied Fashion Design and Marketing at Central Saint Martins, graduating in 2006.

These days, she's working on launching her own clothing label, with an emphasis on travelwear.

When it comes to dressing up her blossoming baby bump, Francesca has a few fashion favorites she likes to stick to.

'I am living in long V-neck cotton tunics 
picked up from an Ibizan market, Adriano Goldschmied by Blossom jeans, 
oversized white shirts, Osman's floral embroidered tops and Peter 
Pilotto's high-waisted floaty printed dresses,' she revealed.

She told PhilStar.com in 2013 that her famous fashion designer aunt has been an important source of inspiration.

'From my Aunt Donatella, I learned a lot 
of things,' she said. 'She is very active, always traveling the world for work and 
she was an inspiration for my uncle.

'I thank them for the many 
inspirations they taught me. They brought me to fashion shows in the Nineties and I believe that was my training for my fashion vision.'

Francesca added that she acquired her aunt's 'sense of humor' and 'lightness of spirit. She loves to 
laugh. She has an amazing sense of humor. You'll never get bored with 
Aunt Donnie.'
