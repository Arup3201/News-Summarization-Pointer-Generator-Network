United Airlines customers were left furious on Wednesday evening after the company announced that it would be voiding all tickets which were sold at hugely discounted rates because of an online glitch. 

The error, which was first identified by customers on Wednesday morning, saw first class, round-trip, transatlantic flights on offer for as little as $74, provided travelers registered themselves as being located in Denmark.

But, eight hours after the error was first spotted, the airline dashed the hopes of thousands of holidaymakers after refusing to honor any bookings made as a result of the online glitch, blaming a 'third-party error' for the mistake and accusing customers of trying to 'take advantage' of the situation.

For a brief period of time on February 11, round-trip, first class fares from London to Newark were available on United.com for just $74

Null and void: United issued a statement on Wednesday evening which said that the airline would refuse to honor bookings made during the website glitch

'United is voiding the bookings of several thousand individuals who were attempting to take advantage of an error a third-party software provider made when it applied an incorrect currency exchange rate, despite United having properly filed its fares,' a statement issued by the airline said. 

'Most of these bookings were for travel originating in the United Kingdom, and the level of bookings made with Danish Kroner as the local currency was significantly higher than normal during the limited period that customers made these bookings.'

The airline's announcement, which was released via its official Twitter account at approximately 6.20pm EST, prompted a flurry of irate replies from hundreds of disappointed customers.

A number of holidaymakers accused the company of violating the Department of Transportation's (DOT) regulations regarding airline travel, while others threatened to pursue legal action against United, particularly those who had received confirmation emails from the company hours earlier.

'Get ready for a couple of thousand DOT complaints,' one user wrote, while another added: 'So you f****d up and are retracting legal contracts?! See you in court!' 

Outrage: Customers were quick to vent their frustration on Twitter with many threatening to pursue legal action against the airline

Ruined reputation: Many questioned why the airline would risk destroying its credibility for the sake of saving money

Several other customers merely voiced their frustration and anger at the situation, with many accusing United of ruining their eagerly-anticipated holidays. 

'Fine. But you have to tell my kids we're not going to NY this summer,' a disappointed parent tweeted, while a second person promised to boycott the airline in the future, saying: 'I have been a @united customer for over a decade. That might come to an end now.'

The error on the website was first spotted this morning at around 10am EST, with a number of eagle-eyed travelers taking to Twitter to spread the word about the glitch which saw travelers offered return, first class flights from London to New York for just $74.

The round-trip first class tickets from Heathrow to Newark, just outside of New York City, were snatched up by lucky holidaymakers for just 491 Danish krone due to an apparent error on the site.

By registering as a customer in Denmark, holidaymakers could snap up the deal, which would normally set them back between $5,618 and $6,778.

 

Bargain! The unbelievable fare totaled 491 Danish krone, which comes to $74

It is unclear how the deal happened and it appears United quickly made changes to prevent anyone else from purchasing the cheap tickets.

One customer who snapped up the bargain fare said she simply logged on to United.com and changed her country status to Denmark.

She then chose her dates and made sure to select business class or first class from the drop down menu.

Then, using a credit card without a foreign transaction fee, the purchase was completed and a confirmation email sent, although the customer did say she left her country as 'Denmark' when filling out her postal address.

Despite the low costs, two customers reported finding 'miscellaneous' charges from the airline on their debit or credit card statements - which they believed to be an additional booking fee of $40 per ticket - meaning the total price of their tickets was closer to $100 each.

A second customer secured first class transatlantic flights for a total of 1,356DKK - around $206 or £135

Both customers said that they were happy to pay the additional amount however, as the price still worked out much cheaper than a full price first class ticket.

Daily Mail Online attempted to secure the same deal at approximately 16:20 GMT, but found that selecting Denmark from the country drop down menu was no longer an option.

The country option was then turned back to the original country of origin, which was in this case the United Kingdom.

In an earlier statement provided to MailOnline Travel, a spokesperson for the company said: 'United has temporarily suspended sales from its Denmark website because a third-party software provider applied an incorrect exchange rate and was misquoting the airline’s properly filed fares.

'This error in the application of the exchange rate primarily impacted individuals who live outside of Denmark and who were not traveling to or from Denmark but were attempting to book tickets using United’s Denmark site.'
