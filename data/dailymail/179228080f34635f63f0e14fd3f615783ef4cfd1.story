Human rights campaigners are appealing to the Chinese government to spare the life of a battered wife who killed her violent husband after suffering months of appalling abuse at his hands.

Li Yan, 41, from Sichuan province in South West China, was tortured by husband Tan Yong who cut off one of her fingers and stubbed 
cigarettes out on her face.

On another occasion he locked Li outside on the balcony of their apartment for several hours 
with little clothing in the freezing Sichuan winter.

Plea: Campaigners are appealing to the Chinese government after battered wife Li Yan, 41, was handed a death sentence for killing her violent husband Tan Yong

Desperate Li, who needed hospital treatment after one attack, contacted the authorities on several occasions to seek protection from her husband.

The police took pictures of Li’s injuries after one beating, but no action was taken and the violence continued.

But in November 2010 she snapped and in a bid to stop the beatings she hit her husband over the head with the butt of an airgun rifle.

When she realised he was dead she panicked and attempted to dispose of the body by dismembering it and boiling it.

Li Yan was sentenced to death in August 2011 for murder. The Supreme People’s Court in Beijing 
approved the  sentence in mid-January and Li is currently being
held at Anyue County Detention Centre.

But more than 100 Chinese scholars and legal experts now have signed an open letter calling for her sentence to be commuted on the grounds that her claims against her husband were not properly investigated.

Roseann Rife,  Head of Amnesty International East Asia,said: 'Justice is not served by executing Li Yan. 

'Amnesty International calls upon the Chinese authorities to commute her death sentence to a term of imprisonment.

'Had the Chinese authorities protected Li, as they are required to under international law, this tragic outcome could have been avoided. 

'Li’s claims should have been properly investigated and her husband prosecuted before she resorted to violence herself.'

The case in China raises the issue of domestic violence in China where figures show one in four women will endure spousal abuse in their lifetimes.

On one occasion Li reportedly telephoned the police after a beating but they hung up telling her they do not get involved with affairs between 
married people and hung up.

A study by China Women’s University found that of 121 women serving time for attacking or killing abusive partners, 71 were originally sentenced to life in prison or to death and 28 more were sentenced to at least 10 years.

Ms Rife added: 'Victims of domestic violence should not have to live in fear and isolation. The Chinese authorities are obliged to prevent violence against women, including by their husbands, and to properly investigate all claims and prosecute those responsible. 

'They need to address this issue urgently and provide proper support and protection.'
