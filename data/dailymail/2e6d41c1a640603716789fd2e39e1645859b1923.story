Jellyfish are growing in numbers around the world and cost marine industries millions every year.

But a South Koren scientist may have found a way to combat the problem, by producing a killer robot which shreds the fish up and destroys them within seconds.

The machine called JEROS (short for Jellyfish Elimination Robotic Swarm) can kill 900kg of the gelatinous creature in an hour using its deadly propellers.

Trapped: The jellyfish are hunted down by the system's cameras and attract them into a net

The robot patrols the seas for the fish using a GPS system attached to motors below the surface and can plan its attack using cameras.

According to the website Fast Company, the deadly system then traps the animals in a submerged net before ingesting them through the blades.

Hyun Myung, director of the Urban Robotics Lab at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, designed the system so three robots could travel together and act as one.

He started to think of a way to kill them in 2009, when the South Korean marine industry lost an estimated $300 million because of the creatures.

During a test run, one system shredded 900kg of jellyfish in one hour, a sign that the killer robots could provide a way to combat the growing jellyfish population.

The system, which is cheaper than trapping them in a net, would save millions for marine industries every year and could save lives.

Earlier this year, a five-year-old Japanese boy died after he was bit by a jellyfish while on holiday with his family in Borneo.

No return: The creatures are then sucked towards the propellers

Destroyed: The fish is then shredded to death as it passes through the blades and is pulverised with no trace left

Finished: The JEROS then pulverises the rest of the swarm before it continues to search the ocean

Earlier this week, a large cluster of jellyfish forced one of the world’s largest nuclear reactors to shut down after it caused a blockage in the pipes.

Oskarshamn nuclear plant closed its third reactor for the second time in one weekend after a giant wave of jellyfish clogged the pipes that bring in cool water to the plant's turbines.

It was not the first time operators at Oskarshamn have been forced to close reactors due to jellyfish, and marine biologists say could become more common across the globe.

Lene Moller, a researcher at the Swedish Institute for the Marine Environment said: 'It's true that there seems to be more and more of these extreme cases of blooming jellyfish.

‘But it's very difficult to say if there are more jellyfish, because there is no historical data.’

Moller said the biggest problem was that there's no monitoring of jellyfish in the Baltic Sea to produce the data that scientists need to figure out how to tackle the issue.

Blocked: The Oskarshamn nuclear power plant in southeastern Sweden was closed after jellyfish clogged surrounding pipework

Issue: Marine biologists say jellyfish could become a more common problem acorss the globe after a swarm of the creatures forced a Swedish power plant to close
