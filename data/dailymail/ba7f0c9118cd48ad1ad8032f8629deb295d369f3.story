Last night saw The Apprentice return to our screens for the tenth series.

The first episode of the business-minded reality show saw the contestants battle it out in a classic selling task, with contestants given products from opening tasks over the past decade to hawk.

This series will see 20 competitors fight for the position of Sir Alan Sugar's apprentice and the  £250,000 investment prize, and the debut episode has already showcased some feisty female characters as women's team Decadence secured the first win.

As we look forward to a new season of shoulder pads at dawn we've drawn up a list of some of the most memorable women of the past decade of The Apprentice...

Last night saw The Apprentice return to our screens for the tenth series

Katie Hopkins 

Age: 39 

Series: Three, 2007

Place: Third

Remembered for... Controversy: From day one of the third series, Katie showed that she was not afraid to ruffle a few feathers and the 39-year-old has remained consistent in this practice ever since.

Katie forwent her place in the finals after deciding to leave the competition in the penultimate episode as she was concerned about making time for motherhood.

Since her appearance on the reality show Katie has remained one of the most famously outspoken celebrities of the moment, regularly making appearances on This Morning to offer her opinion on controversial subjects including 'common' children's names and why the obese are unemployable.

Katie famously embarrassed herself when she claimed that she did not like 'geographical names' when appearing on This Morning to claim that names are linked to class. Philip Schofield then pointed out that her own daughter was called India.

Katie has also come head to head with several celebrities including, the late Peaches Geldof, Lily Allen and Gemma Collins. 

Where is she now? Katie works is carving out a career as a reality star, TV pundit and columnist.

Ruth Badger 

Age: 36

Series: Two, 2006

Place: Second 

Remembered for... Losing out: Aside from earning herself the memorable nickname of The Badger, due to her headstrong management techniques, Ruth was mainly heralded as 'the one who should have won.'

Ruth lost to her fellow female competitor Michelle Dewberry back in 2006 leaving fans of The Badger outraged and disappointed.

Although The Badger did not technically win she showed that she was no loser either: her consultancy firm made £1million the same year. 

Ruth has since hosted her own television show, an alternative to The Dragons' Den called The Big Idea, starring herself as an expert panelist.

Where is she now? Ruth is still running her own consultancy firm, Ruth Badger consultancy.

Michelle Dewberry

Age: 35

Series: Two, 2006

Place: First

Remembered for...  An unhappy ending: Michelle successfully beat favourite Ruth Badger back in 2006 and claimed the position of Sir Alan's apprentice, but her glory was short lived. 

Michelle started dating  fellow contestant Syed Ahmed and fell pregnant once the show had finished. Shortly after her win Michelle stepped down from her role at Sir Alan's firm following a series of emotional and physical setbacks, including exhaustion, the unexpected pregnancy and then - sadly - a miscarriage.

Where is she now? Michelle has recently beaten an ongoing battle with skin cancer and is working across several projects.

Debra Barr 

Age: 26

Series: Five, 2009

Place: Third

Remembered for... Being the bad girl:  From episode one, we saw her dragged regularly (kicking and screaming) into Sir Alan's 'boardroom', hectoring her rivals, fighting her corner and making excuses when things went wrong.

She was reportedly hugely unpopular with fellow Apprentice contestant, James McQuillan saying: 'She's a nightmare to work with - a pit bull.' 

In one of the tasks she was set - to sell a selection of tacky goods on a shopping channel - she performed so well she was accused of cheating. 

When she notched up huge sales of polyester ponchos, it was alleged she'd phoned her family and persuaded them to buy a consignment - something she emphatically denies.

Perhaps her most shocking move was when she received a dressing down from Sir Alan after he disapproved of her treatment of Nick Hewer.

Where is she now? Debra is currently working for herself as CEO of company Xcess Trading which she founded in 2011

Stella English

Age: 34

Series: Six, 2010

Place: First

Remembered for... Losing it all: Before landing a £100,000 job with Lord Sugar Stella worked as a £80,000-a-year bank trader.

She enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with £600 meals of lobster and caviar, £300 designer shoes and three homes reportedly worth £1million, however Stella now claims that she lost everything in a legal battle with Sir Alan.

Three years after her win Stella took Sir Alan to court   at an employment tribunal.

Stella claimed the prize job was a sham and that she was no more than an 'overpaid lackey'.

She lost the case - since it emerged she couldn't prove that she had uttered a word of complaint about her role before resigning - and was roundly trashed by her former boss, who accused her of being a 'money-grabber' and 'not a nice person'.

Where is she now? Stella is now working for Crowd Box, the world's first crowdfunding TV channel

Luisa Zissman 

Age: 27

Series: Nine, 2013

Place: Second 

Remembered for... Fame hunting: The 27-year-old came second to fellow female contestant Leah Totton after her pitch to open an online baking supplies company failed to win over the judges.

However, this did not stop Luisa from making her name known in the business sector as well as pretty much every other industry.

Since her appearance on the show Luisa has landed several modelling campaigns including those for Protein World and her own collaboration with swimwear range Pretty Pink Princess which have both seen Luisa posing in her underwear.

Luisa also tried her hand at a slightly more laid back reality TV show when she joined the thirteenth series of Celebrity Big Brother where she finished fourth overall but not before revealing that she was bisexual and had been treated for a sex addiction.

Where is she now? Luisa has recently become engaged to her Irish millionaire boyfriend Andrew Collins who proposed to her earlier this week in Paris.

Leah won Sir Alan over and bagged first place over her competitor Luisa Zissman, despite the fact that Sir Alan wasn't initially keen on her business idea

Leah Totton  

Age: 26 

Series: Nine, 2013

Place: First

Remembered for... Convincing Lord Sugar: Leah reached the finals of last year's Apprentice with much ease, remaining a favourite to win from early on in the competition.

However, at the final Luisa Zissman's online bakery almost stole the crown from under her nose after Alan Sugar seemed to take offense to Leah's pitch of a Botox clinic.

When discussing a potential winner with his business aids Nick Hewer and Karren Brady Lord Sugar stated: 'As far as Leah is concerned, she doesn't look like she wants to listen. It's all very well being adamant about what you want to do but she will need to listen.'

The odds looked as though they were in Luisa's favour however, Leah was determined to win and a powerful ending speech seemed enough to convince Lord Sugar. 

The 24-year-old said to the business mogul: 'I think I'm first of all, pitching a fantastic business opportunity, completely unique and it's extremely lucrative.

'And also, you're investing in me as a person and I genuinely think I'm a dependable, trustworthy person to invest in. And I really think that this is a fantastic opportunity for you and myself.'

It wasn't long before Lord Sugar was pointing his finger at Leah. She was hired.

Where is she now? Leah currently runs her own cosmetics clinic, Dr Leah, in London
