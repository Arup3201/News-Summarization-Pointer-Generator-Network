Tesco's embattled chairman is a Whitehall and City veteran who is not shy of bruising showdowns with Ministers and company executives.

But in his spare time Sir Richard Broadbent runs courses with his Buddhist wife in ‘compassionate communication’.

One colleague said he appeared to be a typical City boss in a sharp suit but was actually an ‘ageing hippy’.

Rise and Fall: Tesco's half year profits for the last five years, including this autumn's revised prediction

Sir Richard, 61, is under fire over his leadership during the time when Tesco somehow over-stated its profits by an incredible £250 million.

In particular questions are being asked about why the supermarket’s finance director Laurie McIlwee was allowed to leave without a replacement being ready to start work immediately.

The Tesco chairman tried to strike a bullish tone when he was grilled about the accounting scandal on Monday – but admitted there would be calls for him to go.

He said: ‘Shareholders I’m sure will decide… whether I’m part of the solution or part of the problem. But my intention is to continue being part of the solution.’

Sir Richard started his £625,000-a-year job at the top of Tesco in 2011, having previously worked in senior roles at the Treasury, Barclays and bus and train operator Arriva.

Yet despite his reputation as a tough businessman and mandarin, he is also a devotee of the touchy-feely philosophy of ‘non-violent communication’.

He and his wife Jill run an organisation called the Centre for Compassionate Communication from their stunning £2.6 million home overlooking the Regent’s Canal in Islington, north London.

The couple put on regular workshops and courses to help people achieve a ‘more compassionate and enriching understanding both of others and ourselves’.

Lady Jill, 48, who married the Tesco chairman seven years ago, has been a practising Buddhist for two decades and goes by the name Vajraghanta.

Sir Richard is ‘heavily involved’ in running the counselling centre with his wife and also has a farm in Norfolk, according to a senior Tesco insider.

The source said: ‘Basically, he is an ageing hippy. It certainly looks and feels like a Buddhist group. He and his wife host the groups together. He is a distinctly odd chap.’

Sir Richard was born in Cambridge in 1953 and studied at Queen Mary College in London and Manchester University.

He spent 14 years at investment bank Schroders before becoming the first non-civil servant to be made a permanent secretary when he took over at HM Customs and Excise in 2000.

After being knighted in 2003, he joined the board of Barclays, where he chaired the remuneration committee that set the multi-million-pound pay of the bank’s controversial former chief executive Bob Diamond.

He was also chairman of Arriva for six years before being made chairman of Tesco in November 2011.

The Tesco insider was scathing about Sir Richard’s suitability for the string of high-powered positions he has held.

He said: ‘I understand he was called ‘Mr Panic’ when he was in the civil service, according to his senior colleagues. It was always a case of, “What is it now, Broadbent?” as he came running into the office.

‘There are not many people who think he knows what he is doing.’

The source said Sir Richard’s biggest failure was to get rid of Mr McIlwee when his replacement, Alan Stewart of Marks and Spencer, was not due to start until December.

He added: ‘They are trying to cover up the extremely poor judgement of having a gap or six months or more where they did not have a chief financial officer in place.

‘He was not strong enough to ensure that when they decided to hire a new chief financial officer from Marks & Spencer that he started with immediate effect.’
