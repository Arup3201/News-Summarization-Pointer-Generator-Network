The brother of the Duchess of Cambridge carried on a running joke about his parents' former careers at British Airways by buying them a set of reclining airseats.

Cheeky James Middleton, 25, bought Carole and Michael Middleton the bizarre gifts for £100 from eBay, according to reports.

His mother Carole, 57 is a former British Airways stewardess, while father Michael, 63, was a flight dispatcher for the company, which has reportedly prompted 'door to manual' jokes at their expense.

And James has taken the joke one step further by buying the pair the seats, which are made by Boeing and are refitted with castor wheels.

Happy couple: The chairs were bought in May 2011, just two weeks after Kate and William married

The chairs were described as 'really cool, funky seating', ideal for 'an office or waiting room' by the seller, according to The People.

The bizarre presents, bought two weeks after the couple had seen daughter Kate marry Prince William in May 2011, also feature in-flight entertainment controls on the arm, seatbelts and tray tables.

James, who reportedly signed up to eBay using his real name and address but changed them in May 2009, has made several purchases from the online auction site, and recently sold a broken-down stereo system for £40.

However, one dissatisfied customer who spent £20 on a hand-me-down CD player from James said it was 'faulty and had previously been tampered with'.

He set up his own business and runs a mail order cake company, but recently expanded into selling wine.

According to the report, he commutes from the flat he shares with sister Pippa, 29, in Chelsea, to the family house where his office is and works 14 hour days.

Mr and Mrs Middleton now run the party supplies website Party Pieces, which Mrs Middleton started from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table.
