This is the adorable moment a young girl suffering from cancer brought a little happiness into her friend's life.

Violet, who is battling retinoblastoma, created a heartwarming video to tell three-year-old Juniper, who has the same condition, that she would be going to Disneyland.

Dressed in her favourite princess outfit, the young fairy Godmother twirls with delight as she tells her friend: 'Juni, you're going to Disneyland!'  

Violet takes to the camera to deliver a very special video to her three-year-old friend Juniper

Juniper, pictured here with her mother, tells the camera that her favourite character is Minnie Mouse

Both girls are huge Disney fans, with Violet naming Mickey Mouse as her favourite character, while Juniper prefers Minnie Mouse.

And Make-A-Wish Foundation America helped Juniper get the chance to visit her favourite character, a year after her friend enjoyed a holiday at the park.

To send her good luck ahead of her trip, Violet, takes to the camera to deliver the good news to her special friend.

'Juni, you're going to Disneyland,' exclaims the cute infant, complete in Disney-style dress.

Violet tells her friend via video how she will have to act as she visits Disneyland on her special trip

'Make sure you twirl like a princess, and do your princess pose, and wave like a princess,' she continues.

'Juni, I'm so happy your wish is coming true, I love you.

'Juni you're going to Disneyland... that's the best present on Earth Juni.'

Violet goes on to add that her friend will get to meet the bees at Disneyland, and describes how they will buzz all around her.

In a touching moment, violet uses Minnie's hand to wave goodbye to the camera 

The video message is signed off in adorable fashion as Violet adds: 'Juni I love you, have so much fun,' before using the hand of a Minnie Mouse cuddly toy, she gives a wave to the camera.

Make-A-Wish have expressed their thanks to Disney for providing theme park tickets for Juni and Violet and their families and for helping them grant nearly 100,000 incredible Disney-related wishes since 1980.

The programme started back in 1980 when seven-year-old Chris Greicius, who was suffering from leukemia, made a wish to be a police officer for a day.

His wish was granted, and as well as being made a uniform, he travelled by police helicopter and became Arizona’s first and only honorary DPS officer.

The youngster passed away only a day later, but from these roots, the programme came into being.
