The creators of South Park were forced to pull a new episode of the adult cartoon from its scheduled air date after a power outage in their studio meant that they couldn't finish it.

It is the first time in the show's history that they have missed a deadline, despite being known for last-minute productions.

Comedy partners and co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are known to create new episodes as close to the transmission date as possible to keep the content relevant.

It is thought that they will often write and finish an episode in six days.

But
their reliance on late deadlines came back to haunt them this week when
the electricity in South Park Studios,California, cut out, rendering 
their computers and animation tools useless.

Production
staff were putting the final touches to an episode called 'Goth Kids 3:
Dawn of the Posers', when the lights went out on Tuesday.

The new show was set to air this week, but due to the delay Stone and Parker had to miss the Comedy Central air date.

Instead they choose to show a re-run called 'Scott Tenorman Must Die', an episode which involves foul mouthed fat kid Eric Cartman tricking a boy into eating his own parents.

Staff at South Park studio broke the news of the blackout on their official Twitter feed.

They
posted pictures of staff huddled in the darkened corridors before 
confirming that the new episode wouldn't be finished on time.

In
a tweet, Trey Parker, later said: 'It sucks to miss an air date but 
after all these years of tempting fate by delivering the show last 
minute, I guess it was bound to happen.'
