In the run up to the Olympics, it is not just sport gripping the Britain - it is also expected to be a bumper year for art, with several London galleries planning blockbuster shows.

The National Portrait 
Gallery announced yesterday it had made 7,000 extra tickets available for Lucian 
Freud Portraits, to keep up with the massive public demand.

The exhibition has proved to be a crowd puller and 50,000 visitors have already passed through since it opened at the 
beginning of February.

Royal seal of approval: The exhibition even received a royal visit from the Duchess of Cambridge, who is said to have dwelled for a moment on 'Pregnant Girl', an oil on canvas from 1961

With more than 100 paintings and works 
on paper loaned from museums and private collections throughout the 
world, Lucian Freud Portraits is the result of many years planning by 
the gallery in close partnership with the late artist himself.

It has already extended its 
Saturday opening hours as well as late staying open later on Thursday and Friday.

The exhibition even received a royal visit from the Duchess of Cambridge, who is said to 
have dwelled for a moment on 'Pregnant Girl', an oil on canvas from 
1961.

It also includes Freud's 
famous 1995 nude portrait of Sue Tilley ‘Benefits Supervisor’, which 
sold in 2008 for a record-breaking £17.2m - making it the most valuable 
painting ever to be sold by a living artist.

Denise Vogelsang, the National Portrait 
Gallery's head of marketing, said to The Independent: 'This year is such
an incredible year for art in London. Galleries are increasingly 
looking to opening longer because there are so many blockbuster shows.'

Among the most anticipated 
exhibitions this year, is a Damien Hirst retrospective at the Tate 
Modern, which the organisers have billed as 'the first substantial 
survey of Damien Hirst’s work ever held in the UK.'

Running from April to September, it will be part of the London 2012 Festival, the culmination of the Cultural Olympiad.

Earlier this year, The National Gallery 
extended its opening times for the highly successful Leonardo da Vinci exhibition which had a resounding public reponse. 

Demand for tickets to Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan, rocketed after critics hailed the exhibition as a ‘once in a 
lifetime show’ - it was the fastest selling exhibition in the gallery's 
history, according to a spokeswoman.

Touted
as the most complete display of Leonardo’s paintings ever held, to 
avoid overcrowding, the numbers of visitors were limited to 180 every 30
minutes, down from the usual 230.

Hot tickets: The National Gallery extended its opening times for the Leonardo da Vinci exhibition and there were three-hour queues for the 500 tickets which went on sale each morning

There were three-hour queues for the 500 tickets which went on sale each morning.

Many art lovers were so desperate to see the
show, they paid up to £250 to unauthorised online touts after official 
advance tickets, priced at £16, sold out.

The final attendance figures hit almost 324,000, the most popular and fastest-selling show for a National Gallery exhibition of that size and in the final week, the gallery extended opening hours until midnight for two days 'to mop up the queue'.

Jill Preston, the gallery's head of communications, said: 'Throughout the exhibition, there was a lot of pressure to open later. Even when we did, there was pressure to open later, even for 24 hours,' reported the Independent.

Although the idea of staying open 24 hours a day was proposed, it was not possible after it emerged that the delicate Leonardo paintings could not be exposed to the light for that amount of time.

The Royal Academy has also seen queues for A Bigger Picture, its exhibition of works by David Hockney.

It is almost completely sold-out until April and the gallery has extended its opening times until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.

The Institute of Contemporary Arts, has decided to go open six days a week, instead of five.

When its new exhibition 'Remote Control' opens next month, it will open at 11am instead of noon.

ICA managing director Karen Turner told the newspaper it was a 'reflection of the increasing demand from the public'.
