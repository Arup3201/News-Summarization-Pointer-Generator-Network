One witness said she knew something was wrong when 'things started shaking'.

Another said it was lucky no children were on top them having a ride, which is what the animals are used for.

But officials at a circus near St. Louis are yet to disclose how three elephants managed to escape their handlers on Saturday, breaking free from the arena and running amok through a parking lot.

Television station KMOV reports that the
 female elephants escaped from the children's ride section of the Moolah
 Shrine Circus at the Family Arena in St. Charles, Missouri, about 5pm.

Police have confirmed three elephants escaped the Shrine Circus in Missouri on Saturday afternoon, roaming the carpark and damaging multiple cars before trainers were able to occupy them between some trailers (pictured)

Multiple cars were damaged, however no one at the circus was injured. Police added that the elephants damaged the venue's loading door

A circus official said the three elephants got away from their enclosure, went under a garage door and then walked around the parking lot damaging two campers and two pick-up trucks belonging to circus employees

The animals are said to have burst past some parked RV trailers and made their way to the parking lot.

'Things started shaking, When I looked up I saw three elephants coming toward us,' Sally Schmiz, a witness to the event, said.

'These huge elephants literally went through these huge RVs.

'Then they went through two trucks breaking mirrors off, and panels off and breaking the windows.'

Police said they also damaged the venue's loading door.

Circus officials confirmed the elephants got loose and are the ones used for children's rides.

However they were tight-lipped on further details. 

'The elephants were loose for a brief period,' said Dennis Kelley, President of Moolah Shrine Circus.

'The handlers were able to occupy the animals and they are resting comfortably at this time.'

Officials with Moolah did not indicate how the incident happened.

According to authorities, no one else was hurt during the incident.

'Thank God no children were on top of them for rides, or adults too,' Schmiz said.

'You could tell they were upset.'

The elephants, who were resting in a trailer shortly after the incident, did not take part in Saturday night’s performance upon the recommendation of a trainer.

They are expected to resume their duties on Sunday.
