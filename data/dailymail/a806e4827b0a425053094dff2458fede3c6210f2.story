Rescue efforts to find an 11-year-old girl who went missing in waters near a Washington state beach have been suspended.

The Coast Guard said in a release that it conducted its search for the girl, identified as Lindsey Mustread by the New York Daily News, for seven hours in the water and across Long Beach.

Mustread and her brother were dragged out because of a riptide on Thursday, according to reports.

Authorities said the older sibling encouraged the other to swim to safety but is now believed to have perished herself.

Missing: Authorities believe Lindsey Mustread, pictured, is dead. Her brother was rescued on Thursday

Mustread's 10-year-old brother, who has been identified by local media as Kenneth Mustread, was recovered from the water, hospitalized and discharged, according to KATU.

'His sister had encouraged him to swim to shore, was the last thing he remembers before he was separated from his sister,' U. S. Coast Guard Lt. Scott McCrew told the station.

Long Beach Police Chief Flint Wright said of Mustread, 'We believe that she has drowned' while speaking to the New York Daily News.

'At this point, we are waiting to recover the body,' Wright told the paper. 'It will be up to tides and nature when that happens.'

Onlookers were saddened by the family tragedy that marred the holiday weekend in the area.

Bill Thompson said the waters in the spot were 'deceiving'.

'If you go too far it’s a sheer drop and there’s no way to get out of that especially when the winds blowing like it is, the water just rolls you,' he told KATU.
