The New Jersey grandfather who won the $338 million Powerball lottery last week has now pledged to pay rent for his whole block for a month or two.

A friend of Pedro Quezada, 44, told the New York Daily News: 'He said he’s going to pay the rent for everybody here on this block for at least a month or two months. He’s such a good guy.'

Bodega owner Quezada has become well-known for his generosity in Passaic, New Jersey, where the immigrant moved from the Dominican Republic 26 years ago.

Neighbor Richard Delgado, 45, reacted happily when he heard of the new millionaire's promise. 'God bless him, and thank you,' Delgado told the Daily News.

Another man in the block in School Street, Passaic, said the people in street rarely saw Quezada and his Mexican wife, Ines Sanchez, as they worked so hard.

'He’s somebody who needs it, not like the people who had millions already and won it,' Cheech Rivera, 57, said.

Rivera explained to the Daily News that the couple didn't attend summer block parties. 'They struggled. They are always constantly working,' said Rivera. 'They don’t really have time to get together with us.'

Winners: He was joined by his wife Ines Sanchez, center, to talk about their plans for spending the money

Mr
Quezada earlier said that he will buy his wife 'whatever she wants' with the money. He has settled the $29,000 he owed in child support. This was claimed before Quezada collected his huge winnings.

Quezada was joined by Sanchez, when appeared at a New Jersey Lottery 
press conference in Lawrenceville on Tuesday afternoon to talk about his
shock at the massive payout, and what he intends to do with it.

'I will help those in need,' he vowed in Spanish, adding that he was planning on buying 'a good car - the one I like'.

He said he would no longer be working at the bodega he has owned in Passaic, New Jersey for seven years, and will insist that his 23-year-old son, who runs the store, will quit the job as well.

'With all those millions, would you allow your children to work in a store like that?' he said.

Mr
Quezada, who has another son, 15, and three daughters, aged five, 10 
and 17, joked that he would continue to pay the lottery despite his huge
winnings.

But he said he 
was also wary of people around him who may want to take advantage of his
new-found riches, and declined to give the name of his hometown in the 
Dominican Republic.

Kind-hearted: Quezada said he has not decided on the specifics, but hopes to help people in need

'You have to be careful, some people aren't good people,' he said. '[My life] has to change because it's so much money, but it will not change my heart.'

He was vague about where he plans to go next, but said he might buy property in New Jersey, the Dominican Republic or Mexico.

Mr Quezada also detailed the moment he discovered he had the winning ticket.

He had previously been caught celebrating on camera after learning about his win at Eagle Liquors.

'The store is located on the way to my 
deli store so when i saw the commotion outside I figured maybe the 
winning ticket was purchased there, so that's why i stopped,' he said.

'When the gentleman checked, he said, "Congratulations".'

Only when he saw himself and his wife on television did he realise it was real, he said.

His
wife, to whom he has been married for nine years, said she thought her 
'heart wanted to come out of my chest' when her husband called her with 
the news.

'I had no words,' she said. 'All I can say is I feel very happy because God has blessed us with this prize.'

Mr Quezada took the winnings as a lump sum, which came to $152 
million after taxes. Federal tax is 25 per cent of the payout, and the 
state gets another six per cent.

The moment of discovery was captured by the swarms of media gathering in the store.

'We
won! We won! We're not gonna be poor anymore!' he told his mother as he
spoke on the phone in Spanish after discovering the massive win, the New York Post reported.

'I can't believe it. I'm overwhelmed. I was praying so much for this,' he added to the Daily News.

Celebration: Mr Quezada said he will be quitting work, buying a new car and helping the community

Riches: If he chooses to take a lump-sum payment, Mr Quezada will get $152 million after taxes

Stunned: The bodega owner and 44-year-old father of five discovered he had the winning ticket in the shop

He said he hopes to help people with the money, and his son said his father will continue to work.

'He's going to stay here doing what he loves to do,' Casiano Quezada told The Star-Ledger.

Quezada, who lives in a shabby third-floor apartment on a block next to a highway, began working in a factory after arriving in the U.S. 26 years ago.

In
2006, he opened his own bodega, which is run by his son Casiano, 23. 
But he chooses to play the lottery at Eagle Liquors because he never 
applied for a license.

Casiano
told the Post that he was working at the bodega when his father called 
with the good news - but that he initially didn't want to close the 
store because he didn't want to lose business.

Joy: His son, Casiano Quezada, smiles while talking to members of the media inside Apple Deli Grocery

Change ahead: Quezada (pictured with a friend) runs the bodega, which his father has had for seven years

Worker: After the win, the younger Quezada didn't want to shut the store because of losing business

Devoted: Casiano Quezada closes early on Tuesday. He said his father will continue working despite his win

Neighbours
added that the family, including Quezada's wife, Ines 
Sanchez, were rarely seen, and they assumed it was because they worked 
so much.

Eladia Vazquez, who has lived across the 
street from Quezada for the past 25 years, described the coupe as 'quiet and not overly 
talkative' but sensed that they seemed to be working all the time.

'This is super for all of us on this block,' she said. 'They deserve it because they are hardworking people.'

Quezada's wife Ines added: 'We're hardworking people. We always struggled.'

Quezada said he had not yet decided what to do with the money but knows 'I'm going to help a lot of people, whatever they need'.

He has three daughters, aged five, 17 
and 10, and two sons, a 15-year-old and 23-year-old Casiano. He also has
five brothers and two sisters.

Joy: His wife, Ines Sanchez, spoke in Spanish as she told media they hope to help others with the money

Life-changing: Quezada is pictured on the phone to relatives as he shouts that he's a millionaire

Ecstatic: He is pictured running from the store after discovering he has just won $338 million

He has been given about 10 liens totaling more than $25,000 between 1998 and 2011.

He
learned of his mega win after going to Eagle Liquors. One sister, Paula
Quezada, 32, told the Post she had joked with him that he should check 
his lottery numbers.

Richard Delgado, who lives down the 
block from Quezada's building, said the man was 'a hard worker, like all
of us here. We all get up in the morning and go to work.'

Mr Delgado said he got up Sunday 
morning and was going to take his dog for a walk when he heard the radio
announce the Powerball results.

'When I heard there was one winner 
and it was in New Jersey, I immediately went and checked my tickets,' 
Delgado said. 'I wanted to be that guy.'

Proud: Store employee Pravin Mankodia stands outside Eagles Liquors in Passaic, N.J., where he sold the winning $338 million Powerball ticket that was claimed by a New Jersey resident

Winning location: The owner of the store will win $10,000 for selling the winning ticket

Store owner Sunil Sethi, who will 
receive $10,000 as the seller of the winning ticket, said he's proud to 
have sold it. He said he was contacted by lottery officials on Monday 
with the news.

'Very exciting - unbelievable,' Sethi, who has owned the store for eight years, told the New Jersey Star-Ledger.

'He (or she) don't have to work no more. If he is living in Passaic, he's definitely moving out.'

He said that his store must be one of the luckiest in the area as last year they sold a ticket worth $156,000, he said.

'It feels awesome, we feel so lucky.'

The prize -  $338.3million - is the fourth-largest jackpot in Powerball history.

Powerball
said on its website that the grand prize jackpot has now been reset to 
an estimated $40 million or a lump sum cash amount estimated at $25 
million for Wednesday's next drawing.

Announcement: Carol Hedinger from the New Jersey lottery has revealed there is just one winning ticket

No one had won the Powerball jackpot 
since early February, when Dave Honeywell in Virginia bought the winning
ticket and elected a cash lump sum for his $217 million jackpot.

The
largest Powerball jackpot ever came in at $587.5 million in November. 
The winning numbers were picked on two different tickets - one by a 
couple in Missouri and the other by an Arizona man - and the jackpot was
split.

Nebraska still holds the record for 
the largest Powerball jackpot won on a single ticket - $365 million. 
That jackpot was won by eight workers at a Lincoln meatpacking plant in 
February 2006.
