Hospitals are allowing sales reps into maternity wards to pester new mothers into using their products, it has emerged.

The Bounty company is sending staff to hospital beds across the country, where they hand out free samples of items such as nappies and skin creams – with the approval of NHS bosses.

A survey found eight in ten mothers consider the tactic unacceptable.

More than half of the women surveyed felt that Bounty had invaded their privacy

The Bounty reps then collect name and 
address details, which are passed on to commercial partners to help them
target new parents. Half of new mothers say they were not told that 
this was voluntary.

The ‘rude and intrusive’ reps also 
have a government contract to distribute child benefit claim forms – 
with many reportedly implying their forms are the only way to claim the 
allowance.

Bounty pays around £2.3million to the 
NHS annually for access to maternity wards in fees and non-medical 
equipment, such as televisions.

This commercialisation of childbirth 
by the NHS has been condemned by parenting website Mumsnet, the National
Childbirth Trust and some family doctors.

A survey by Mumsnet of more than 1,000
mothers who gave birth since May last year found that over half – 56 
per cent – thought that the Bounty rep invaded their privacy.

The vast majority – 82 per cent – said they did not think hospitals should allow sales reps access to wards at all.

Some 60 per cent were not specifically
told that personal details collected by Bounty reps would be passed on 
to other companies.

Mumsnet users reported being badgered 
by over-zealous Bounty sales reps, with almost one in five implying that
parents would be able to claim for child benefit only if they fill in 
the forms from Bounty.

Some 55 per cent of new mothers said 
the Bounty rep came at an inconvenient time for them, while more than 
half – 53 per cent – rated their post-natal pack from the company as 
poor, with not much of use inside.

Belinda Phipps, chief executive 
officer of the National Childbirth Trust, said: ‘Within hours of giving 
birth, mothers are being asked questions – their name and address, 
details of life insurance – and they give them in good faith, thinking 
they’re speaking to a hospital person. In fact it’s a commercial person.

Vast majority of women said hospitals should not be allowed access to women so soon after childbirth

‘The NHS is condoning a sales team collecting data from mothers in order to sell their name on to commercial interests.’

One Mumsnet user reported how her 
newborn was picked up by a Bounty representative without permission 
while she recovered from an emergency caesarean section.

She said: ‘She is my first baby and at
15 hours old I wasn’t prepared to hand her over to anyone else, even if
they had asked. I found her rude and intrusive at a time that was 
personal and I felt vulnerable.’

Bounty insists that more than 90 per cent of mothers are ‘satisfied’ with the free packs.

The group offered a comment from 
Anthea Gregory-Page, the deputy head of midwifery at Shrewsbury & 
Telford Hospital Trust, who said: ‘We have a good working relationship 
with Bounty, who have been offering services at the trust for more than 
20 years.’

Mumsnet chief executive, Justine 
Roberts, said: ‘Women rightly expect hospital wards to be a safe place, 
and targeting new mothers at their most vulnerable is simply not on.’
