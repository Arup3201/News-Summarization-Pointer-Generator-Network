A mother whose premature daughter was the scapegoat for AOL CEO Tim Armstrong slashing the company's retirement benefits has accepted the boss' 'heartfelt' apology.

Deanna Fei was stunned when Armstrong blamed exorbitant medical costs for two 'distressed babies' as the reason for the 401(k) policy change and spoke out about the 'completely dehumanizing' remarks over the weekend.

However, last night she said Armstrong phoned her to apologize. He has also reversed the 401(k) change and publicly admitted he 'made a mistake.'

'I really feel like he spoke to me ... not in his public role as CEO, he spoke to me in a heartfelt way as a father of three kids to a fellow parent,' Fei told Today. 'His apology was heartfelt and I appreciated it and I do forgive him.'

She added: 'I understand we all sometimes say things we wish we could take back.'

Fei's husband, Peter S. Goodman, is executive business editor at AOL-owned Huffington Post. The New York-based couple has a son and daughter.

'I don't think Tim Armstrong meant to hurt our family,' Fei told Today before speaking with the CEO.

But she said she felt she needed to speak up to defend her daughter, who was born four months premature and spent three months in intensive care.

'It did sound like the implication (was) that somehow we were greedy consumers of healthcare benefits, that we had gobbled up more than our share of the pie. It felt like an invasion of my family's privacy and it felt like a dehumanization of my daughter.

Spotlight: Armstrong's views of women at work were put under scrutiny after he accused two mothers of 'distressed babies' of being to blame for cutting AOL 401(k) benefits. One was Deanna Fei. They had their daughter, pictured shortly after birth, in October 2012. She was four months premature and spent three months in intensive care

'I felt like someone has to speak up for her. She can't tweet, you know, she can't go on TV to defend herself, she can't justify the spending that saved her life. She didn't deserve to get singled out in this way.'

Fei said the experience (of having a premature baby) was so traumatic that even some of the couple's closest friends didn't know what happened, until she spoke up in response to Armstrong's insensitive remarks.

'When I saw the headlines, it was sort of impossible to process he was talking about my daughter,' Fei told NBC Nightly News last week of the moment she first heard Armstrong's controversial comments. 'It (was) a violation - for singling us out for using the health plan we paid for.'

Armstrong's policy changes would have 
switched 401(k) matching contributions to an annual lump sum, rather 
than being distributed throughout the year with every paycheck.

The switch would have cost employees who left mid-year and even those who stayed, since they would not see the benefits of compounding in their retirement accounts, Washington Post reported.

But the embattled chief made matters worse when he tried to explain the controversial plan during an employee meeting last Thursday.

Armstrong told a story about two women covered by AOL who had complicated pregnancies, forcing the company to shell out $2 million 'above and beyond' what was necessary.

He said, with Obamacare potentially adding $7.1 million to AOL's costs in addition to the 'distressed babies', the company needed to find cost savings elsewhere and was forced to change 401(k) to protect itself.

Armstrong reportedly earned $12 million in 2012.

The comments caused a publicity storm, with employees sending letters to Armstrong, and Huffington Post giving it big coverage. Twitter blew up with outraged users.

As a result of the outcry, Armstrong apologized publicly and agreed to restore the original 401(k) policy.

'The leadership team and I listened to your feedback over the last week. We heard you on this topic,' he wrote in an email to employees, according to Business Insider.

'And as we discussed the matter over several days, with management and employees, we have decided to change the policy back to a per-pay-period matching contribution.'

However Fei, author of 2010 bestseller 'A Thread of Sky', remained upset.

She decided to pen a heartbreaking first-person article for Slate in which she recounted the painful birth of her now one-year-old daughter and 
reprimanded Armstrong for his thoughtless comments.

Writer: Deanna Fei is the author of 2010 novel, 'A Thread of Sky'

'I take issue with how he reduced my daughter to a 'distressed baby' who cost the company too much money. How he blamed the saving of her life for his decision to scale back employee benefits,' she wrote.

'How he exposed the most searing experience of our lives, one that my husband and I still struggle to discuss with anyone but each other, for no other purpose than an absurd justification for corporate cost-cutting...

'Our daughter has already overcome more setbacks than most of us have endured in the span of our lives. Having her very existence used as a scapegoat for cutting corporate benefits was one indignity too many.'

In the harrowing piece, Fei explained how her little girl was born prematurely on October 9, 2012, with reddish-purple skin, bloody and bruised all over.

'One doctor, visibly shaken, described it as "gelatinous,"' she wrote. 'I couldn't hold my daughter or nurse her or hear her cries, which were silenced by the ventilator. Without it, she couldn't breathe.'

Doctors told the couple their daughter might not survive one month or one week or one day. She also had at least a one-third chance of being severely disabled.

In the toughest months, the little girl suffered a brain hemorrhage, her right lung collapsed and one morning, she stopped breathing altogether. 

She spent three months in the NICU, enduring blood transfusions, head ultrasounds, the insertion of breathing tubes, feeding tubes, and a central line extending nearly to her heart.

'Because the day of her birth was the furthest thing from a happy event, because so many of her first days were lived under the specter of death, I've never had the luxury of taking her presence for granted,' Fei wrote for Slate. 

'It can be a struggle to set aside my lingering trauma amid the daily realities of coordinating her care to simply celebrate the fierce, beautiful girl who has completed our family.

'All of which made the implication from Armstrong that the saving of her life was an extravagant option, an oversize burden on the company bottom line, feel like a cruel violation, no less brutal for the ludicrousness of his contention.'
