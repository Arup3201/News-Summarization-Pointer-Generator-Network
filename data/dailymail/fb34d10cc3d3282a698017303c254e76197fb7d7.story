From supernatural strength to an unfortunate taste for human blood, vampires have long enjoyed a terrifying reputation.

But according to a pair of real life British vampires Vanian, 53, and Ethereal Dark, 27, who both hail from Manchester, the reality of vampiric living is somewhat different.

Although they do sleep during the day and drink blood, the married couple insist that they would never take it unasked ('That would be assault!' says an outraged Vanian).

Acceptance: Vanian, 53, and Ethereal Dark, 27, want people to be more accepting of vampires

Myths: The couple are also keen to bust vampire myths, among them a dislike of garlic, churches and mirrors

Nocturnal: Although the couple can - and do - come out in the day, they prefer to 'honour the night'

They also are happy to eat garlic, can get near a cross without mishap and even like churches, while fake fangs are a no-no.

'It's a myth that you can bite someone to get blood because that would be assault,' explains a wearily patient Vanian. 'You don't know whether they have infections either.

'We don't sleep in coffins - we don't even have a coffin. We don't walk around with fangs either; in fact, we don't have false fangs.'

They do, however, enjoy a drop of blood or two with most coming from volunteers who have been dubbed 'Black Swans' by the vampire community, or from each other.

'Too much blood would make you vomit,' adds Vanian. 

'It's not like in a film where it's dribbling down your chin. Your body tells you.

'It's personal too. It's always done one on one. We drink blood about twice a week but we do eat other food as well, especially red meat.'

Vanian, who says he uses a little razor rather than fangs to extract blood from his wife, is at pains to point out that not just any blood will do.

'Black Swans have to get a health certificate or [drinking blood] is like Russian Roulette,' he continues.

'You don't know what they've got. Infections are everywhere. Also, we don't hack people up, that's not what we're about. Anyway, you'd be arrested if you did that.'

Other vampiric myths that Vanian and Ethereal Dark are keen to quash include any suggestion that they can't enter churches and don't have a reflection.

They also say that far from being forcibly turned into a vampire as shown in films and TV series such as True Blood, the process happens via what they describe as a 'gentle awakening'. 

'It can happen at any age,' explains Vanian. 'It's a calling. A natural progression. You realise that you don't feel like everyone else. 

'You start asking questions and waking up to who you really are. It's a way of looking inside yourself and yes, you do lose people when it happens.

'We're doing this interview to educate people,' he adds. 'It's your choice whether you believe in what we say or not.'

Supper: The pair say they are happy to eat human food and only take blood from each other

Community: The couple run a group for fellow vampires and say there are many more than you might imagine

Given that the couple closely resemble goths and have little in the way of fictional vampires' supernatural powers, are they surprised that people question their credentials? 

'We do encompass the gothic culture. and we may well look like gothic people. It's always been there with the culture, the music, the artwork,' ripostes Vanian.

'The vampire extends to goths but there are people in our community who have mainstream looks. It's not necessarily a look that everyone wants. There could be someone three seats down from you who is a vampire and you would never know about it.'

Much like the 'normal' appearance of the vampires in True Blood and Twilight then, although Vanian says he's far from impressed by the latter.

Good stuff: Vanian and Ethereal Dark are fans of True Blood which they say is - in some respects - accurate

Ridiculous: Twilight by contrast is well wide of the mark and bears little resemblance to the couple's lives

'True Blood is very good but Twilight is not,' he says. 'No we don't sparkle. Again, it's not the true story. It's not my world.'

Nevertheless, the couple say they would like more people in their world and hope that in time, people will become more accepting of their lifestyle.

'I'd like people to understand that we're real and that we're here to stay,' says Vanian. 'We're not horrible or evil and we want acceptance for what we are.

'Acceptance that there is a different way of living. People should be more open minded.'
