Federal reports have revealed that terrorists would only have to sabotage nine out of the 55,000 electric-transmission substations across the U.S. in order to cause a national blackout that could last for more than a year.

A coast-to-coast blackout has become a very harrowing- and plausible- prospect that has scared federal regulators into issuing warnings calling for widespread security precautions to be put into place.

The Wall Street Journal has published the findings from a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that told how the three electric systems could be brought down entirely by attacks on select stations.

Three parts: The United States energy grid is made up of three systems that only have minimal interactions which means that only nine stations would have to be attacked to shut down the whole system

'Destroy nine interconnection substations and a transformer manufacturer and the entire United States grid would be down for at least 18 months, probably longer,' wrote FERC's director of external affairs Leonard Tao in a June memo that was only revealed publicly today.

Adding to the problem, the solution is not as simple as just protecting these nine stations because there are reportedly 30 stations that meet the necessary criteria but less than a third of them have to be attacked. Experts differ on the number of stations that would fall into said category- with others putting it closer to 100- but it does not diminish their concern.

â€˜It is neither a monumental task, nor is it an inordinate sum of money that would be required to do so,â€™ former FERC chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in an email to the Wall Street Journal.

At the moment, existing laws focus on security protocols at nuclear power stations as opposed to those that deal with standard electricity.

Attacked: Fears were renewed over the safety of electricity plants after an attack on the Metcalf plan in San Jose, California which took place in April 2013 when one or two men attacked 17 towers in less than 20 minutes

Concerned: Senators Dianne Feinstein (left) and Harry Reid (right) were two of the four who are now pushing for an exploration of a security expansion for many electric plants in light of sabotage fears

The stations are owned and operated by private companies, and many of them only have cameras and chain-link fences to fend off attackers.

Should the attack focus on only one of the country's three major systems, that wouldn't be much help to those effected, however, because the three systems interact so minimally that it would be very difficult to transfer electricity from one system to another.

Concern about attacks on power plants was renewed after a strike on a power station in California in April 2013.

One or two gunmen were able to break 
into a PG&E station in San Jose, cut the communication lines and 
then go on to shoot up  17 transformers in under 20 minutes. They were 
able to flee before police arrived because it took so long for any 911 
calls to go out since they had knocked out the fiber optic cables 
serving the facility which facilitate phone calls.

'This
 wasn't an incident where Billy-Bob and Joe decided, after a few 
brewskis, to come in and shoot up a substation,â€™ retired vice president 
of transmission for PG&E, Mark Johnson told The Wall Street Journal 
in February. 

Lit up: The Santa Clara Sheriff's Office released this surveillance footage of the attack which shows the gunshots going off on the grounds of the PG&E facility

Sparks flew: No one was injured and the power didn't actually go out in the area because the state grid was able to maintain it but officials fear that it was a test run

'This was an event that was well thought out, well planned and they targeted certain components.'

Power in southern California did not go out after this incident because the state grid operator was able to prevent the fallout, but it did prompt enough concern to make experts fearful.

In February, four Democratic Senators sent a letter to federal regulators asking if they needed to install mandatory security standards for power companies to enforce at their plants.

Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Harry Reid of Nevada, Dianne Feinstein of California and Al Franken of Minnesota wrote that the sabotage was a "wake-up call to the risk of physical attacks on the grid."

'This incident came uncomfortably close to causing a shutdown of a critical substation which could have resulted in a massive blackout in California and elsewhere in the West,' they wrote.

In December, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Cheryl LaFleur told Congress grid security is a top priority, and her agency cooperates with utilities to protect physical equipment.

Federal cybersecurity standards for protecting the grid are in place and mandated. However, rules for protecting physical sites such as transformers and substations are voluntary.

The culprits were never found and the area didn't lose power because the state grid was still working but experts thought it could have been practice

There are around 55,000 power plants around the U.S. but anywhere between nine and 100 would have to be attacked to ruin the system
