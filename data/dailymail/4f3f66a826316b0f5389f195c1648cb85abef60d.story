Secret documents about the inquiry into the Profumo Affair could eventually be released - but possibly not for another 50 years, it emerged today.

They examine former war minister John Profumo’s affair with 19-year-old Christine Keeler in 1961 which happened while she was also in a relationship with Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov.

One major element of interest is whether the files - which were declared too sensitive for even the head of MI5 to read - hold the names of any other ministers in Harold Macmillan's government.

Top judge Lord Denning looked at whether Britain's Cold War security had been compromised when he carried out the Government's inquiry into the scandal, reported The Daily Telegraph.

The Denning Inquiry was a bestseller upon its publication in 1963, although critics lamented it as a cover-up designed to protect the Establishment.

Background files - including notes from Lord Denning's interviews with 160 witnesses - have been kept secret in the Cabinet Office for more than half a century.

Now, Lord Wallace of Saltaire - the spokesman for the Cabinet Office in the Lords – has revealed the papers will be given ‘permanent preservation’ status, raising hopes they will one day be released.

Lord Wallace told the peer and historian Professor Peter Hennessy in a written parliamentary answer that there were ‘some sensational personal items’ in the documents.

'My guess it they will put at the very least 75 years on it, which would be 2039'

And Prof Hennessy told the Daily Telegraph: ‘If it is selected for permanent preservation, it can only mean eventual release - because if it's never going to be released, you wouldn't preserve it.

‘My guess it they will put at the very least 75 years on it, which would be 2039. But I wouldn't be surprised at all if they put 100 years on it, making it January 1, 2064.’

The scandal happened at the height of the Cold War when it was discovered that Keeler had been sleeping with both Profumo and Ivanov, a naval attache based at the Russian Embassy in London.

Keeler, a model, and Profumo began their affair after being introduced at a party at the Cliveden estate in 1961 by their mutual friend Stephen Ward, a high-society osteopath and portrait-painter.

Profumo, who was married to actress Valerie Hobson, had no idea that Keeler was also sleeping with Ivanov. In March 1963 he told the House of Commons that rumours of his affair were untrue.

But he was forced to resign three months later after admitting lying. Ward, who was prosecuted for living off immoral earnings, took an overdose the day before his trial ended and died in August 1963.

Keeler was found guilty of unrelated perjury charges and was sentenced to nine months in prison.
