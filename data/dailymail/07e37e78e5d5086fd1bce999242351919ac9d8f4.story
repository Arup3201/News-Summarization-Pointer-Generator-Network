One of eight circus acrobats who plummeted about 20 feet to the ground during a hair-hanging stunt says she's thankful she's alive and wants to return to the ring.

'I'm hoping to join back up with the tour and show the world that I'm OK, and I'm hoping some of the other girls will do the same,' Samantha Pitard told The Associated Press yesterday after she was released from a hospital.

Pitard and seven other acrobats were in an act described as a 'human chandelier', in which they were hanging from an apparatus by their hair.

They were injured during a Sunday performance of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus when a clip at the top of the chandelier-like apparatus snapped, dropping them to the ground 20 or more feet below. The other women are still hospitalized.

Pitard, 23, a native of Champaign, Illinois, said she is the only one of the troupe who can walk on her own.

The others need assistance or have not tried to walk because they are still undergoing operations. But she said the others are expected to fully recover and everyone is in good spirits.

'Every single one of us in the troupe, every single circus performer, knows that they are risking their lives every time they go out there to perform or practice,' she said.

'We hope it doesn't happen, but we know that we are taking that risk, and we love it enough to take that risk every day to make people happy.'

Pitard said it was a normal day and normal performance on Sunday. The curtain dropped to reveal the eight women suspended in the air, but it went wrong as soon as they did their third leg position.

'We heard a huge crack, huge noise, and then we were just plummeting to the ground,' she said. 'It was very fast. I remember everything.'

The 
350-pound chandelier fell on top of them. She said the rescue crews got 
to them quickly to free them from the apparatus, then give them medical 
attention.

'I
 was sitting up, and once I caught my breath, I was looking at all the 
girls,' she said. 'I wanted to know that everybody was OK. I saw my 
troupe leader (Viktoriya Medeiros), she was right next to me, and I 
heard her say that she couldn't feel her legs.'

The paramedics instructed her to lie down.

Pitard
 described her injuries, including fractures on her spine, a cut on her 
head that required three stitches and a badly bitten tongue, as minor.

Local
 investigators have completed an initial probe into the circus accident 
and are turning over a broken clip and other material to federal 
workplace safety investigators.

The
 carabiner clip was one of several pieces at the top of a 
chandelier-like apparatus that was suspending the acrobats during Sunday
 morning's performance before 3,900 people, many of them children.

Fire 
investigator Paul Doughty said investigators have narrowed down the cause of the broken clip to 
two possibilities: a manufacturing defect or improper use. The latter could have to do with how it was installed in the rigging, he said.

The
 circus inspected all of its equipment on Monday night when it loaded up
 in Providence and planned another inspection when it unloaded in 
Hartford, Connecticut, said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld 
Entertainment, Ringling's parent company.

The
 circus is replacing each carabiner in the show before the next 
performance, on Thursday in Hartford, he said. The hair act won't be 
performed there, the company said.

The
 equipment has been used dozens of times per week since the beginning of
 the year, and a circus crew had installed it last week, Payne said.

The crew told investigators the clip had been visually inspected before the show.
