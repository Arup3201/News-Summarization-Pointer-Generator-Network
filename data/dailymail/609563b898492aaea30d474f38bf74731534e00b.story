Caught: Campen was found after he posted pictures of himself with the chicken on Facebook

A drunken lout stole a school's pet chicken and posted pictures on Facebook of him posing with it at a houseparty.

Anthony Campen, 29, kidnapped the chicken from a nearby primary school before dragging it to a houseparty where he posed with it before releasing it into the wild.

Police used the pictures to force Campen to admit his crime after he posted a number of photos on Facebook.

A court heard how Campen had carried the chicken to a houseparty in his rucksack before he posed for pictures with the startled bird.

The partygoer then fed the chicken party snacks before releasing it into a nearby field.

Pupils at the Bishops' Church of England and Roman Catholic Primary School in Chelmsford, Essex, had believed their pet chicken, called Olympia, had escaped before they began to suspect foul play.

The school has since released a heartbroken plea in their school newsletter for sightings of the chicken in Chelmsford to no avail.

Campen, from Chelmsford, Essex, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal sometime between January 26 and 28 this year 2012 when he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates Court on February 20.

Magistrates were told of the distress caused to young children at the school who had lost a much-loved pet which they had raised from a chick as part of a school project.

Campen was ordered to pay £130 compensation and £85 costs.

Unrepentant Campen later tweeted: '£235 for a f*cking chicken. Right, i'm off for a kfc!!'

A spokesman for Essex Police said:
'Essex Police are pleased that Campen has admitted this offence and 
that he has been ordered to pay compensation.

'This chicken had originally belonged to a
primary school in Chelmsford and the loss of the bird caused great 
distress to the children.

Devastated: Staff and pupils at the school were distraught to have lost their beloved Olympia

Furious: Bishops' Church of England and Roman Catholic Primary School where Campen stole the chicken

'The chicken has never been found and it is highly unlikely it would have survived in the wild.

'Campen's actions were totally unacceptable and we hope he thinks long and hard about the upset and distress his loutish behaviour has caused.'

An RSPCA spokesman added: 'Caring properly for animals is a serious issue, and failing to do so because of drunken behaviour is no excuse.'
