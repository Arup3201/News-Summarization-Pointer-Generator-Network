Gooey black muck that dropped from a tanker truck last night crippled about 150 cars and damaged many more as it today threw the Thanksgiving travel plans of hundreds of motorists into chaos.

A leaking valve on a tanker, which was hauling up to 5,000 gallons of driveway sealant, spread it over the eastbound lanes along a nearly 40-mile stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike on Tuesday night.

Turnpike officials said 150 or more cars were disabled when the sticky goo covered their tyres and wheels, while some state police and turnpike maintenance vehicles had to be towed away.

The spillage happened between New 
Castle and the Oakmont Service Plaza on Tuesday night and cars soon got 
stuck in the tar-like substance, according to the turnpike operations 
centre.

Traffic was moving 
normally by Wednesday morning, but the sticky mess had already hindered 
the travel plans of some motorists traveling for the Thanksgiving 
holiday.

Laura
Frick told WTAE-TV she was traveling from Cleveland to New Jersey for 
the holiday. ‘Now we have to turn around and go back home,’ Frick said. 
‘It’s horrible.’

Bob King told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review it was the most harrowing experience of his life.

‘It caught us off guard,’ said the Chicago-based retired fireman. ‘It didn’t seem like anyone knew what it was or what to do. It had to be an incredible amount of tar. It’s still piled on my tyres.’

Corporal Mike Corna, of the state police barracks that patrols the pike near Pittsburgh, said the truck driver will be cited for not properly securing his load.

But the specific tickets to be issued were still being determined and police have yet to trace the origin of the load. The tank was filled in Ohio.

Maintenance crews got out quickly, dumping sand on the pooled goop and using snow ploughs to push it on to the shoulder, a turnpike spokesman said.

The mess was mostly confined to the right lane and the roadway didn’t have to be shut down while workers tried to clean it up because the substance hardens in about 15 minutes, he said.

‘It’s been cleaned up since about 11 o’clock last night,’ the spokesman added on Wednesday.

Turnpike officials urged motorists whose cars were damaged to stop calling its operations centre and instead call Traveler’s Insurance.

The insurance company is handling claims on behalf of Marino Transport Services of Stevensville, Maryland, which operates the truck.
