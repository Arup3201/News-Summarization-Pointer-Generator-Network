Facelifts for bulldogs and pugs have surged, it was reported last night.

The Royal Veterinary College has revealed the number of operations on dogs to remove excess skin has risen by more than 80 per cent in the past four years.

Without facelifts, some pets can be at risk of going blind or dying because their airways are blocked - but the surgery can set owners back up to £2,000.

It was reported last night that the rise in celebrity ownership of the animals was behind the rise in the number of operations.

The number of procedures has increased from an average of 30 five years ago to more than 260 a year, according to Dr Gert ter Haar, senior lecturer at the Royal Veterinary College.

Celebrity owners such as Jonathan Ross, Kelly Brook, and Kelly Osborne have fuelled the rise in popularity of owning pedigree pooches.

Dr Haar told The Daily Telegraph: 'We are treating a lot of pugs but it is because they are very popular due to celebrities.

'People like the way they look. We are treating eight times more pugs than we were five years ago.'

'People have been breeding dogs for centuries and they are doing nothing wrong – this is about education.'

Dr Haar said he handles four to five of pet facelifts every week – but only do so if there is a medical reason.

He said: 'Breeding has led to shortening of muscles in their faces. Most are fine, but we see the ones that have problems because of their breeding.'

Senior vet Paul Manktelow at the PDSA animal charity said that the operation was 'in no way a vanity or cosmetic exercise', despite being referred to as a facelift.

He added that it was an important veterinary procedure carried out purely for dogs health and well-being.

Chantelle Meloy's dog Bentley, a Shar Pei, had to undergo a facelift at a clinic in London because the huge folds were covering its eyes, she told the BBC Two programme Young Vets. Shar Peis, also known as the Chinese wrinkle dog, can be traced back to the Guangdong province of China.
