Prince Amedeo of Belgium married Elisabetta Maria Rosboch von Wolkenstein in an elegant Italian ceremony - as the rest of his country watched in despair as Argentina kicked their team out of the FIFA World Cup.

The 28-year-old royal, who is sixth-in-line to the throne, is the eldest grandchild of the abdicated King Albert II and Queen Paola of Belgium. He is the nephew of King Philippe, who ascended the throne last year following the abdication of King Albert II.

Prince Amedeo married Elisabetta, the only child of Italian aristocrats, at The Basilica of Our Lady in Trastevere, Rome.

Natural beauty: Elisabetta's hair was swept off her face in a simple up do, held in place by a sparkling diamond tiara. Lace on the bodice, neck and arms added feminine touches to the sweeping white gown

Dashing: The groom, Prince Amedeo of Belgium, who is sixth-in-line to the throne, arrives with his mother Princess Astrid of Belgium. Princess Astrid looked beautiful in a powder blue ensemble

Just married: Prince Amedeo and Elisabetta look delighted as they leave The Basilica of Our Lady in Trastevere after the ceremony. The couple, who both went to university England, now live in New York

Sealed with a kiss: Surrounded by friends and family, the newlyweds stop and share a kiss on their way out of the church. The pair were blessed by the Pope at the Vatican shortly before announcing their engagement

Elisabetta arrived at the ceremony with her father Ettore Rosboch von Wolkenstein, wearing a sweeping white wedding gown complete with veil and tiara.

She looked radiant as she stepped out of the car, with a flower girl on-hand to make sure her delicate veil remained pristine.

Her dress was simple and classic, with subtle embellishment on the chest and delicate lace detailing on the bodice and arms adding a feminine touch to her look.

The bride opted for natural-looking make-up - her beaming face was framed by a romantic veil. And a diamond tiara added the perfect touch of glamour.

The wedding was a family affair, with Prince Amedeo's grandparents - King Albert II and Queen Paola - and aunt and uncle - King Philippe and Queen Mathilde - all in attendance.

The couple, who live together in New York, had been dating for around seven years before they became engaged.

The news was officially announced 
in February, shortly after the couple were blessed by the Pope at the 
Vatican alongside hundreds of other engaged couples.

Elisabetta - who is known more commonly as Lili - works as a arts and 
culture reporter at Bloomberg, where she writes under the name Lili 
Rosboch.

Like her new husband, Princess Elisabetta also studied in England, receiving a degree in literature and film from Queen Mary University in London.
