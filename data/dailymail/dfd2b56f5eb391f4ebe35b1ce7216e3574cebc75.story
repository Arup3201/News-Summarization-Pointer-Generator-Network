A parish council chief who buried a haul of deadly weapons in his garden has died awaiting trial in prison, leaving the reason he kept the guns a complete mystery.

Villagers were left in shock when Jim Arnold, 49, was arrested after massive police operation uncovered an arsenal which included Uzis and AK47s behind his house in Wyverstone near Stowmarket, Suffolk. 

He passed away while on remand in high-security Belmarsh Prison and was due at Ipswich Crown Court tomorrow to face a string of firearms offences. 

It means no one will ever know why he hid the guns or why he collected them in the first place.

Search: Police officers discovered the haul of illegal weapons behind Jim Arnold's home in Wyverstone near Stowmarket, Suffolk. He died in prison while awaiting trial for firearms offences 

Eddie Gale, 74, who lives about 500 yards from Mr Arnold's home, said it was a complete surprise to villagers.

He told the BBC: 'I knew Jim was into shooting, but it was normally clay pigeons rather than Uzis.'

'He used to knock on the door and ask if it was all right for him to have a group at his place shooting.'

Following his arrest in April, he appeared before magistrates in Bury St Edmunds via a video link from the prison in Thamesmead, London, looking ill and fragile.

He originally faced four firearms offences but it is understood that police were preparing to add to the charge list before Mr Arnold appeared at Ipswich Crown Court tomorrow.

The former chairman of the parish council had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and told friends in the village last year that he only had months to live.

Suffolk police revealed yesterday that he died in jail on July 14th and that the Crown Prosecution Service has ended the case against him. 

Weapons: The stash included a number of high-powered assault rifles such as AK47s

Powerful: During a month-long search, police also found a number of Uzis hidden in the collection

Current vice-chairman of the parish council Eddie Gale said yesterday: 'It is a very sad end - Jim was well-liked and respected in thevillage for all the hard work he put into the community.

'He was on several committees and an invaluable part of the village -everyone was stunned when the police raided his home and the place was surrounded and sealed off for weeks as they searched his garden.

'It was just unbelievable to think that he was in some way involved with guns or crime - no-one had any idea that firearms might even have been a hobby of his. 

'His death was not unexpected - he told me he had cancer and only a few months to live last March. Everyone is very sad but in a way it is a kind of release for him

'His widow wants to have Jim buried in the local church and I am sure there will be a really good turnout.'

Custody: The former parish council chairman was on remand in Belmarsh Prison, Thamesmead, London
