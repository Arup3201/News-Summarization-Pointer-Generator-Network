Emmanuel Adebayor has lifted the lid on his collapsed deadline day move to West Ham, admitting that Daniel Levy blocked the deal because of Tottenham's rivalry with the Hammers.

The Togolese striker had been set for a temporary move away from White Hart Lane, with West Ham and QPR two of the front-runners for his signature, but all deals fell through at the last minute.

'The club decided to send me out on loan, which I was pleased with,' Adebayor told Sky Sports News on Wednesday. 'I was lucky enough to have five good clubs in my hand, and I decided to go for three... and then I chose the one I wanted to go to. Luckily Mr Levy was against this because they're kind of like rivals.

Adebayor has made just 11 Premier League appearances for Tottenham so far this season

'The club decided I should stay, and I'm very happy to stay at the club and I'm here to do my job.' 

Adebayor has had a difficult season at White Hart Lane, making only 11 Premier League appearances for Mauricio Pochettino's side. After a 2-1 home defeat to Stoke City on November 9, Adebayor travelled home to Togo to deal with personal issues, leaving north London amid a chorus of boos.

'I'm very sad about that,' Adebayor continued. 'We lost the game against Stoke at home, which I was not very pleased about obviously. If you play for Tottenham, it's a team that wants to finish in the top four, you're supposed to be beating Stoke City at home.

Daniel Levy stopped Adebayor leaving for West Ham on Monday because of the two clubs' rivalry 

Adebayor went back to Togo for personal reasons after Spurs' loss to Stoke, where he was booed by fans

'Straight away after the game I was not happy. I was a little bit upset about the way we played, and obviously some journalists asked me questions. I gave them the answer and they twisted it. Most of the fans believed what they read, and I came out clearly and said "I didn't mean to hurt anyone." At the end of the day, I know how much they pay to come and watch us.

'I'm Togolese, if I'm not part of my Togolese national team and if I see them playing and they are not playing well, if I have to insult them or boo them, I would do the same thing so I can understand their feelings.'

Despite the problems Adebayor experienced with the supporters at White Hart Lane, he returned to action on January 17, before captaining the side against Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup.

Adebayor said celebrating with fans after scoring is the most beautiful moments in a footballer's life

He looked set for a temporary stint away from the club after further boos as he left the field, but will now stay at Spurs and fight for his place in the team. For Adebayor, the problems are firmly behind him. 

'If anyone thinks I am not happy with [Tottenham's] support it is a lie,' he said. 'At the end of the day, they are the ones that make me run more, they are the ones that make me score goals. Otherwise what is the point of scoring goals? 

'If you score goals, you run in front of the fans and salute them, they are the most beautiful moments in a footballer's life. For me, I think they have a bad interpretation of what the journalists [said]. We have to forget those things and move on.'
