Education minister Christopher Pyne has posted an image of a fortune cookie on Twitter, prompting a slew of comments from social media users speculating about the move.

The picture, uploaded to Twitter on Wednesday night, showed a fortune cookie with the message: 'Insist on what you are doing. Your goal will be reached soon.'

The postcomes after Pyne failed to convince the Senate on Tuesday to pass his university reform laws this week for the second time, prompting requests from Labor for Pyne to be sacked, reported Sky News.

Christopher Pyne uploaded the image Twitter on Wednesday, sparking a torrent of ridicules from people accusing him of taking advice from a cookie

The post has seen Pyne taken to task on social media, with dozens of users lambasting him for seemingly taking advice from a cookie.

Rose Steele wrote : 'You should be basing your #highered on public support not a fortune cookie'

'I prefer Ministers to not take their advice from cookies', wrote Lady of Polly Tricks.

Pyne has been attempting to overhaul the education system, introducing laws that would allow universities to set their own fees and financially penalise graduates who do not repay their student debts, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

Despite the second time failing to convince the Senate, Pyne has vowed he will never give up on his higher education campaign.

Speaking to Nine news, Pyne said: 'I never give up, no, I will not give up. It's too important to allow the Labor Party who are political opportunists and the Greens who are the same, to wreck this reform.'

Opposition higher education spokesman Kim Carr has claimed Pynne's relationship with the Senate is now 'poisonous'.

'This minister's bluff, his bluster, his bravado simply leaves people cold,' Senator Carr told ABC on Wednesday.

'It is time for him to consider his future and if he doesn't then he should be sacked.'

Speculation has now emerged that the government is considering launching a double dissolution over the education bill.
