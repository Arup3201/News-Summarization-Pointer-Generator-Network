Newcastle United's Remy Cabella is spending his spare time watching videos of Peter Beardsley as he attempts to make his way in English football.

The 24-year-old France international was drafted in from Montpellier during the summer to add the kind of invention which the Magpies had been lacking since Yohan Cabaye's departure for Paris Saint-Germain in January last year.

He found the going tough during his opening few months on Tyneside, but has gradually started to find his feet, and part of that process has involved studying footage of one of the club's most celebrated sons.

Cabella said: 'I have watched YouTube a lot to watch Peter Beardsley over again. When I arrived at Newcastle, every player here told me to check what he did on YouTube.

'Peter was a top-class player. I looked and "Woah!". He was brilliant. More than that, he is a great human being and a very nice guy. I like him and I hope to learn more from him.'

Beardsley, currently the club's football development manager, has been assisting caretaker manager John Carver and first-team coach Steve Stone since Alan Pardew's departure earlier this month.

He is one of a long line of talented players to have lit up St James' Park over the last two decades or so, and Cabella is desperate to emulate the thrills he and the likes of Paul Gascoigne and David Ginola provided for the Toon Army.

The Frenchman said: 'I know about the famous names that have played for the club like Gascoigne, David Ginola and Peter Beardsley.

'I know Peter very well now. I see him every day and he's a top man, top-class. I want to be like him because he was a good player for Newcastle, like Ginola, and some other players.

'I want to be like them, of course.'
