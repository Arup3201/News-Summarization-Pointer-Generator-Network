A woman who accidentally backed over and killed her long-term girlfriend in their driveway after a row has been sentenced to seven years in prison.

Angelia Hanson, 30, from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, pleaded guilty to first-degree involuntary manslaughter last month, telling the judge she did not want to cause anyone any more pain.

On Monday, Judge William Syler handed out the maximum sentence for the charge after agreeing with prosecutors that Hanson's history of drug arrests showed a pattern of reckless behavior.

Hanson has repeatedly said that the death of her girlfriend, 43-year-old Jody Lane, was an accident after a heated argument, calling the woman 'my love, my strength, my motivation'.

The tragedy unfolded on July 19 after the women argued about running late to work that morning, the Southeast Missourian reported.

Hanson told investigators that Lane told her she was heading back inside the house so Hanson 'floored it' and hurtled backwards down the driveway around 8am.

She felt a bump but told investigators she thought she had hit the curb.

Only after dragging her girlfriend several feet did she realize she had hit her, according to a probable-cause statement filed in the case. Lane died later in hospital.

In court on Monday, Hanson's attorney, assistant public defender Patti Tucka, asked the judge for leniency, pointing out there had been no malice or intention in the death.

'This is a woman who is devastated by 
what happened that day when she lost Jody Lane, her partner, her 
friend,' Tucka said. 'This was careless. It was not intentional.'

Tucka added that two police videos revealed how devastated Hanson was after the accident.

'She broke down. She cried; she wailed; she was barely able to go on,' she said, the Missourian reported. 'She will live with this every day of her life.'

Assistant prosecuting attorney Jack Koester acknowledged Hanson had not intended to kill her girlfriend but said that her history of drug, alcohol-related and assault charges, suggested a pattern of reckless behavior, leading him to recommend the full term.

Speaking to the Missourian, Cynthia Hanson, Angelia Hanson's older sister, said her sibling 'loved that woman more than anything in this world'.

She said the couple spoke of marrying and that her sister had treated Lane's children as if they were her own.

She added that her sister had struggled with absent parents and suffered from bipolar disorder and left home at 15 after coming out as a lesbian to her parents.

Angelia and her father were working towards rebuilding their relationship at the time of the tragedy.

'The whole family is just completely devastated,' she said. 'Just heartbroken.'
