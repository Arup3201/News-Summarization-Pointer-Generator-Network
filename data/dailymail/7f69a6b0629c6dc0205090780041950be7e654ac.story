The cremated remains of a stillborn baby have been accidentally thrown away by a Melbourne funeral company.

Police and SES crews are searching a Melbourne landfill site after Tobin Brothers Funerals contacted them about the error.

The family were notified of the search on Thursday, Tobin Brothers managing director James MacLeod has told Fairfax Radio.

'Last week it was reported to me that some cremated remains were missing, that were in our care,' Mr Macleod said.

'We immediately carried out a detailed investigation and found that they had gone out with waste.

'We've identified where they are and we've been searching for them since last Thursday.'

Human error was to blame, Mr MacLeod said, and a full independent investigation would be carried out.

A Victoria Police spokeswoman has confirmed police and SES crews were searching a section of the Hanson Landfill, at Wollert, on behalf of a private company.

'They are paying all the costs relating to the search,' she said.
