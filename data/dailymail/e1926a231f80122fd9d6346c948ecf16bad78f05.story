Gareth Southgate could field this England U21 line up

Gary Neville has insisted that the new generation of young England players have taken ownership of a new attacking style that Roy Hodgson is attempting to introduce to the team.

With Hodgson’s job security receiving a massive boost in a 2-0 victory in Switzerland, England coach Neville has claimed that England are beginning to reap the benefits of Hodgson’s youth policy and his tactical flexibility.

Wayne Rooney revealed he had led players’ only tactical meetings during the recent international break and Neville said: ‘Behind the scenes things are changing. In Basle the players put their arms around each other for the national anthem. 

'They went into a huddle after the game. These young lads have to engage publicly, not just privately, their passion for representing their country.

‘The homework some of the players have mentioned encourages them to think about being an England player all year round, rather than turning up and thinking: “Here we go again, it’s international week”.

‘There needs to be a club spirit and club unity on and off the pitch. Asking them to look at videos, offer feedback and think how they might improve keeps England in their thoughts all year round. It is about the players finding answers for themselves.’

Neville also says Hodgson has deliberately blooded young players early, though the manager is considering pulling some of the younger players out of the senior side to play them in this summer’s European Under-21 Championships. 

‘It will just be a question of Gareth [Southgate, the Under-21 coach] and I deciding which ones are the right ones to send.’ Hodgson said. ‘I am not putting any riders on it at all at the moment.

‘What I am saying is: “Let’s look at players who could play, let’s see what they have been doing club-wise, international-wise and let’s make a good decision — one that Gareth is happy with and one that I think is a wise decision too”. It will be a real discussion point between Gareth and I and we get on very well in that respect.

‘I am certain there will be players who will have made an appearance with us or will have certainly been with us and we are going to say: “Look, just because you have been with us for a while that doesn’t make you a 100 per cent bona fide senior that never plays anywhere else. It just makes you an England player and we are going to use you where we think best”.’

If England Under-21s win their qualification play-off against Croatia next month, a full-strength side at Euro 2015 could theoretically see Jon Flanagan, Calum Chambers, John Stones, Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw, all of whom have England senior caps, selected.

Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Phil Jones are also eligible to play for the Under-21s but, given their roles in the senior side, are likely to be kept fresh, with a friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 coming before another Euro 2016 qualifier away in Slovenia on June 14.
