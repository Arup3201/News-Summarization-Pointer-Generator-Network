Care minister Norman Lamb warned the issue of social care could not be left in the 'long grass'

A Lib Dem minister has launched a last-minute plea for George Osborne to set aside money to end the scandal of pensioners having to sell their homes to fund sky-high care bills.

Norman Lamb, the care services minister, said the issue of social care for the elderly was far too important to be kicked into the ‘long grass’ yet again.

In a strongly worded intervention just days before the Coalition launches its mid-term review, he told the Chancellor: ‘We have just got to get on with it.’

Mr Lamb has been joined by three Tory-run councils which have written to David Cameron urging a cap of £35,000 on the amount people have to pay.

One of them, Kent County Council, yesterday launched a national petition on the Downing Street website demanding the imposition of a cap.

Under England’s current system, pensioners with assets of £23,500 or more – including the value of their homes – have to pay unlimited care charges.

It means that every year, at least 20,000 have to sell their homes to pay for care.

Two years ago an independent commission led by economist Andrew Dilnot suggested these charges should be subject to a lifetime cap of around £35,000, with the state paying the rest.

But Mr Osborne has baulked at the £1.7billion-a-year cost, and there are fears that to reduce the cost to the Treasury, the cap could be set at up to £75,000.

Yesterday former care services minister Paul Burstow called for the winter fuel payment, which goes to all pensioners regardless of wealth, to be means tested to free up money for a cap.

He said the handout, worth around £200 a year, should be limited to those on pension credit. The money saved would help fund a cap of £60,000.

The government is under pressure to commit to the Dilnot Commission reforms to stop people having to sell their homes to pay for care

Mr Burstow said: ‘Social care isn’t free, but it could be a lot fairer for those who have worked hard all their lives.’

Now his successor, Mr Lamb, has joined
 the fray. He urged the Government to commit to a cap and work out how 
it is paid later on.

Former care minister Paul Burstow said radical help was needed to end the 'misery' of huge social care bills

On Monday David Cameron and Nick Clegg will unveil 
their mid-term review: the Coalition’s priorities in the run-up to the 
next election. Social care is expected to be at its heart.

Mr Lamb said: ‘We have just got to get
 on with it. We have got to announce it is going to happen, set the cap 
and legislate for it in the care and support Bill in the next session.’

Mr Lamb said decisions on how the cap 
could be funded – whether through cuts, tax rises or restrictions in 
means-tested benefits – could be made later.

He added: ‘My absolute determination 
is to get the principle in legislation so we have that debate rather 
than it remaining in the long grass.’

Meanwhile three Tory councils – Kent, 
Hampshire and Buckinghamshire – have written to Mr Cameron calling for a
 cap of £35,000 to be imposed by 2015.

Paul Carter, leader of Kent County 
Council, has also launched a No 10 petition, which needs 100,000 
signatures to force a Commons debate.

‘The system we are currently working 
with is simply not up to the job any more,’ he said. ‘I believe that the
 whole nation wants the situation sorted out. It’s time to make it 
happen.’
