The owner of a controversial bikini coffee stand business faces charges of prostitution and money laundering after local prosecutors alleged her baristas were selling sex acts for tips.

Snohomish County prosecutors say that 52-year-old Carmela Panico, a former nude dancer, operated drive-thru brothels in the county north of Seattle with coffee stands named Twin Peaks and Java Juggs.

According to charging documents, her baristas made tips saying they could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars by performing sex acts and could make up to $14 by baring their breasts or genitals.

Authorities also allege that baristas had a certain amount of cash they were supposed to make for Panico, and the rest the women could keep.

The documents also say that Panico could deduct money if the women failed to wear high heels throughout their shifts, did not have a tan or failed to put on makeup. 

It has been reported that some of her employees could earn between $15,000 and $30,000 a month, while one saying she had earned half-a-million working at the stands.

'The sales goals were effectively rent that the girls paid to have the opportunity to perform lewd conduct or acts of prostitution,' deputy prosecutor Bob Hendrix wrote in the report. 

'Her profit margin at times was twice that of well-run, established coffee stands.

'Pancino's businesses were driven by prostitution and lewd behaviour,' Mr Hendrix added.

She was charged on Thursday, the Everett Herald reported.

Authorities also allege that she didn't report her full earnings to the Internal Revenue Service by dealing in large amounts of cash.

A search at Panico's home last year resulted in the seizure of nearly $250,000.

But her attorney told Snohomish County Superior Court that she left the coffee business and sold some of her stands and leased others. 

The investigation has also led to the prosecution of veteran sheriff's sergeant Darrell O'Neill, who is accused of tipping off Panico and her workers to police scrutiny in return for sexual favors.

O'Neill resigned after his arrest last year and has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled for November.
