Dylan Tombides, the West Ham player who lost his battle with cancer last year, is to have a foundation bearing his initials and squad number to remember him.

The 20-year-old died last April after being diagnosed with the disease three years previously.

Tributes to Tombides poured in, with the DT38 Foundation structured to raise awareness and provide support for those suffering with testicular cancer.

The foundation will be launched at Upton Park on Saturday before the Hammers face Crystal Palace in the Premier League, with supporters planning applause for the 38th minute.

The Eagles' visit to east London was also the fixture immediately after Tombide lost his live. 

'On 18 April 2014, Dylan's organs failed and we said goodbye to our beloved son and brother,' the striker's mum, Tracylee, said.

'If we had known about testicular cancer and what we needed to do to catch it early, we would have insisted on an ultra sound when we went to the GP. It breaks our heart to think that this could have been prevented.

'Dylan was robbed of a future that he dreamed of as a young boy. It robbed Taylor of a brother and it robbed my husband and I of watching our beautiful son grow and fulfil his dreams.

'Please do not let this happen to your son, brother, friend or father. If you have a concern with your testicles please see a doctor straight away and insist on an ultrasound – it may just save your life.'
