The plot thickens surrounding the collapse of Tom Cleverley’s move from Everton to Manchester United.

Old Trafford sources claim that Cleverley travelled to Merseyside after Everton had a £7.5million bid accepted but the club then made an unsuccessful attempt to knock United down to £5m.

Cleverley was set to undergo a medical at Aston Villa after they agreed a £7m fee with United but his representatives pulled the plug on the deal when Everton made their move.

Cleverley now faces the prospect of an unhappy few months at Old Trafford.

Villa had agreed a fee of £7m with Manchester United but the England international priced himself out of a move.

Cleverley is believed to have asked for £60,000-a-week and Villa ended their interest on Monday when it became clear negotiations had reached an impasse.

The 25-year-old also saw a proposed move to Everton collapse as he failed to link up with Roberto Martinez, who managed him during a loan spell at Wigan in 2010-11.

Hull were interested but Steve Bruce instead made a late move for Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa.

Cleverley had been made available by Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal and looks to have no future at United.
