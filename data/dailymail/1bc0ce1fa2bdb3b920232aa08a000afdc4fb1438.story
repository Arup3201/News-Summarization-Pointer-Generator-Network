King Leo, an obese cat who had lost 10lbs since being found abandoned on the side of a road this summer, has died.

The feline, who weighed 30lbs when he was rescued in Nashville, Tennessee, passed away Wednesday morning after going into cardiac arrest.

The ten-year-old Maine Coon cat suffered from inflammatory bowel disease and developed pancreatitis. Two weeks ago, he was given a feeding tube and antibiotics, eventually being put on steroids when the medication failed.

His owner, LaTisha Lampley, a veterinary technician, brought him to Blue Pearl Veterinary hospital Tuesday, where he spent his final hours.

Mrs Lampley, 34, adopted the flabby feline in August after caring for him at Nashville's Cat Shoppe Rescue, where he was transported after being brought to Metro Animal Care and Control.

She had been diligently working with King Leo to help the lovable cat fight the battle of the bulge with a rigorous weight loss regime.

Part of the feline's slimming plan involved pounding the water treadmill - a treatment many cats would find daunting. He fast became a favorite with volunteers and staff at Animalia Health and Wellness.

Mrs Lampley frequently posted updates on the cat's fitness. On September 8, she revealed that he was down to 21.3lbs, and by October 3 he was down to 19.4lbs.

However, by mid-October King Leo had become ill with pancreatitis, prompting his owner to set up a GoFundMe page to help pay his medical bills.

A beautiful life: 'Leo passed away around people who loved him and knew how wonderful of a kitty he truly was,' she added

Mrs Lampley made the sad announcement of his passing on Facebook early Wednesday morning.

'Leo was an amazing cat and endured many amazing miraculous odds to be in my life,' she wrote.

'Without the prayers and support of all of you, I would have never been able to try as hard to help him survive this. Leo passed away around people who loved him and knew how wonderful of a kitty he truly was.'
