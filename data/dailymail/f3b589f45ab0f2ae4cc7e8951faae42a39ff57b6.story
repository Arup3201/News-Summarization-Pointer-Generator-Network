Middle-class households fork out more in taxes than they get back from the state, with top earners paying the Treasury £30,000 more than they receive in handouts.

The average working family gives the Treasury £274 more every year than it receives back in the form of tax credits or from public services such as the NHS and schools, a report found. 

It adds that the rich shoulder ‘more than their fair share’, with the top 10 per cent of earners paying an average of £30,023 more in tax than they got back.

Lower-income families are hammered hardest by indirect taxes such as VAT and fuel duty, while income tax is the biggest burden for higher earners, says the TaxPayers’ Alliance. 

The campaign group says the average household has an income of £32,108 a year before tax.

People living in London, the South East, South West and East Midlands were hit hardest by tax, with the average household paying more than it got out in benefits and services. On average, households in the North East received around £3,175 more in benefits per year, although their incomes were lower.

The poorest 10 per cent of homes – with an income of £3,875 a year before tax – paid the highest percentage of their income in tax of any group, according to the figures from 2012-13.

Those at the lowest end of the spectrum were paying 47 per cent of their income in tax, with VAT by far the biggest drain on their finances.

By comparison, the top 10 per cent of earners – on an average of £104,000 a year before tax – paid 35 per cent of their income in tax.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This analysis shows just how pernicious our tax burden has become. Not only does the tax system hit the poorest hardest, but those at the top are already contributing far more than anybody could reasonably describe as their fair share.

‘Our tax system is neither progressive nor fair, and we need radical reform as well as necessary savings if the way we tax and spend is to become fit for purpose.’

The campaign group calls for National Insurance and sales tax to be reduced to relieve the burden on lower-income groups and middle-class families. 

The report comes after researchers revealed that Britons also pay one of the highest proportions of property tax in the world.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found £1 in every £8 paid to the taxman is levied on people’s homes and businesses. This compared with £1 in every £12 in 1990 – a level still seen in countries such as France and Australia.

The Coalition has raised the income tax threshold to £10,000 this year, taking three million of the lowest earners out of paying tax. Around 26 million people have benefited from the income tax changes to some extent, keeping £705 a year on average more than they did in 2010.

To compile the survey, the TaxPayers’ Alliance used data on different income groups from the Office for National Statistics.

It added on average figures for how much each category claims in benefits, including the state pension, jobseekers’ allowance, housing benefit and tax credits.

It then looked at how much they pay in direct tax such as income tax, national insurance and council tax, and indirect taxes including VAT, alcohol and tobacco levies, and fuel and stamp duty.

The lowest-income group receives £7,691 a year of benefits and state services, compared with an average of £6,677. The highest-income group takes only £4,980.
