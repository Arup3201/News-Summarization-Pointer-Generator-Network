The country's 10 most lucrative speed cameras have been revealed - and between them, they have made £12million for the state over three years.

One camera, situated on the M60 in Greater Manchester, caught more than 32,000 speeding drivers - meaning it took in around £2million in revenue.

Campaigners have accused transport bosses of using speed cameras to raise money from motorists, rather than improving road safety.

The top 10 permanent speed cameras in England and Wales were revealed by a Freedom of Information request published in The Sun.

Each of the cameras - which include motorways, city centre roads and more rural routes - caught more than 10,000 people breaking the speed limit over the past three years.

The most lucrative of all was on the M60 near Stockport, where 32,205 motorists were caught speeding - meaning that with the minimum fine set at £60, it will have raised at least £1,932,300.

Next came a stretch of the A4042 near Newport in South Wales, which took in more than £1.4million.

Not all the cameras on the list were located on inter-city roads - major urban thoroughfares such as the Limehouse Link tunnel in East London and Scotland Road in Liverpool also raised over £1million.

It is not only permanent cameras which proved lucrative money-spinners - a temporary camera at the junction of the M1 and M6 in Warwickshire made £1million in 18 months.

The Taxpayers' Alliance criticised the findings, saying they suggested that cameras were being used to raise money rather than reduce speeds.

'It's incredible that just a tiny number of cameras are raking in so much cash at motorists' expense,' said chief executive Matthew Sinclair.

'Driver have long suspected that speed cameras are more about raising money than keeping roads safe.

'The authorities should focus on measure that improve the safety of the roads, not simply look to maximise the amount brought in from fines.'

Controversy: Campaigners have accused road bosses of using speed cameras to make money

A spokesman for the AA said that the vast amounts of money being raised by certain cameras could mean they were not doing their job of preventing against excessive speeds.

'There needs to be a degree of investigation about why so many drivers are breaking the speed limit,' he said. 'Are they understanding the signage? Are the cameras conspicuous, as they are meant to be?

'Cameras that just click away aren't necessarily improving road safety.'

However, he added that more than two thirds of drivers accept the role that speed cameras play in improving safety, according to polls.

Road safety charity Brake defended the importance of cracking down on speeding in accident blackspots.

'Rigorous academic studies have shown fixed speed cameras are exceptionally effective in reducing speeds, crashes and casualties, preventing families going through the unnecessary trauma and pain of a road death or injury,' said campaigns officer Ellen Booth.

'These studies have also demonstrated that speed cameras pay for themselves several times over by preventing costly casualties.

'It's important to remember that cameras only catch drivers who are breaking speed limits, and these drivers are putting others at risk by speeding.'
