Austrian town: The name is thought to derive from a sixth century noble called Lord Focko

An Austrian political party has defended a decision to promote a local beer called F***ing Hell - named after a village in the country and the German word for 'lite'.

The extraordinary brand name was initially banned when the product was released in 2010 but the company took the fight all the way to the EU's trademark authority who eventually overturned the decision.

And the beer was recently promoted on the website of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria, for the district of Schaerding - which neighbours F***ing.

Both districts are found in the northern Austrian province of Upper Austria and the Freedom Party say the promotion was a way of showing solidarity with their neighbours.

The advert on the homepage leads to a website where it is possible to buy the alcohol on order from the neighbouring village of 'F***ing'.

In 2010 the Trade Marks and Designs Registration Office of the European Union ruled that although it might be an obscene swearword in the English language, in German it was simply the name of the village - and a light 'hell' type of beer. 

They said in a statement that it had rejected a complaint that the trade mark 'F***ing Hell' was upsetting, accusatory and derogatory.

They added: 'The word combination claimed contains no semantic indication that could refer to a certain person or group of persons. 

'Nor does it incite a particular act. It cannot even be understood as an instruction that the reader should go to hell.'

Endorsement: An advert for the beer appeared on the website of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria

German marketing executives Stefan Fellenberg, 38, and Florian Krause, 32, who own the rights to the brand name, said they had referred to the town of F***ing in their application to register it.

Location: Upper Austria

Population: 104

Origin: Founded in the 6th century by nobleman called Lord Focko

The recent publicity earned by the Freedom Party is likely to boost the controversial beer brand's sales - bringing money to a town that often falls victim to trophy-hunters.

Franz Meindl, the village's mayor, said: 'Twelve or thirteen F***ing town signs have been stolen. We've taken to fixing them with concrete, welding and rivets.'

The Bavarian towns of Kissing and Petting have the same problem, as does the eastern German town of Pissen. But so far, there are no plans to name a beer after them. 

F***ing's unusual name is thought to derive from the sixth century noble called Lord Focko.

The first known use of the English verb in a vulgar context was in 1475.

The word has also been found in a dictionary dating back to 1598 - and even turns up in Shakespeare's Henry V.

In 2012 residents of F***ing attempted to change the name of the village to Fugging but their bid was rejected as the suggestion was already taken.

F***ing mayor Franz Meindl said that if it was not for their unfortunate name the village with just over 100 residents would be a rural paradise.

He told The Mirror: 'It is beautiful countryside here, it's otherwise peaceful and we have a good community. It's only ever the name that causes us troubles.'
