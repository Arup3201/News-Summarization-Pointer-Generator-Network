A nephew of male model Tyson Beckford allegedly stole a truck and crashed into a bus killing the driver after a night of hard partying with supermodels at New York's most exclusive nightclubs.

Domonic Whilby, 22, was arrested after he allegedly stole a delivery truck in the early hours of Wednesday in Manhattan's Meatpacking District because he couldn't find his limousine.

Whilby, who was reportedly drunk and high on drugs, collided with the city bus at 5.30am, killing driver William Pena, 49, and injuring four others.

Horror crash: An MTA bus and a
 truck rest against scaffolding at 14th Street and 7th Avenue in New 
York after an early morning collision that killed the driver and injured at least four others

The truck collided with the bus at the intersection of 7th Avenue and 14th Street, sending both vehicles slamming into scaffolding surrounding a building.

Mr Pena, from Hillside, New Jersey, was thrown from his seat and pronounced dead at the scene. The 17-year MTA employee leaves behind a wife and 14-year-old daughter.

Whilby, a self-described, 22-year-old 'free-spirited wild child' and
'religious stoner,' was frustrated that a limousine he had expected
to pick him up was not there, witnesses claimed.

The suspect had been ejected from several elite nightclubs due to his out-of-control behavior. He was first removed from nightclub 1 OAK at 3.30am for
getting too ‘handsy’ with some of the female guests.

He had been partying at the club with his famous uncle, 43, and Beckford's 22-year-old Victoria’s Secret model girlfriend,
Shanina Shaik, who was celebrating her birthday.

Instagram photos posted in the hours before the crash show Whilby cozying up to the model and her blowing out candles on a birthday cake.

Whilby then briefly
ducked into the nearby Dream Downtown Hotel but was tossed out after passing out in the lobby.

He then sneaked into an apartment building on West 16th Street, where super Victor Vega told the Daily News he was 'sweating like a mad dog' and pounding and kicking random doors.

Vega told the News that cops said the truck was making an early morning delivery when Whilby jumped inside and sped away.

Before
 plowing into the bus, the truck ran a red light and hit a scooter driver, who was hospitalized with minor injuries.

Eddie Abdelmaty, 51, was driving
to work at the time when the hijacked delivery truck sideswiped him, dragging the
scooter 50 feet before smashing into the bus.

A bus passenger and two 
people on the street were hurt in the crash and also hospitalized at Beth Israel. The victims were identified as coffee cart vendor Ashraf Marei and one of his customers.

Charges are pending against Whilby, who is originally from Georgia. He was slightly injured in the crash and is being treated at Bellevue 
Hospital where authorities are believed to be testing for drugs and alcohol.

The night before the fatal crash, Whilby posted on Facebook: 'Can't wait to hit this beautiful big city tomorrow!!!! Then the journey begins!!!! — feeling wonderful.'

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that Mr Pena was the first city bus driver killed in a 
collision in more than 14 years.

MTA Chairman Thomas 
Prendergast said: ''Our
 thoughts and prayers are with Mr Pena's family.

'We are working 
closely with law enforcement to ensure the perpetrator of this crime is 
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.'

Friends described Mr Pena as a
devoted father and hardworking transit employee who was looking forward to his retirement. 

The stolen truck belonged to the San Francisco-based 18 Rabbit
granola company. The driver was making a delivery and had left the truck in the garage under the Maritime Hotel with keys in
the ignition when Whilby allegedly jumped in the cabin and sped off.

the ignition when Whilby allegedly jumped into the cabin and sped off.

Newspaper distributor Craig Ydolly was on the block facing 
the other way when he heard the crash. He said it sounded like the 
scraping sound a snowplow makes.

He turned around and saw the 
scaffolding falling on crashed vehicles and a man lying on 
the ground. The bus appeared to be leaking gas, Mr Ydolly said.

Jose Cherrez, the superintendent of a building one block from the scene, said the crash woke him up.

'It sounded like an explosion. I heard the ambulances about 10 minutes later,' he said.

Police said one bus passenger and two people on the street, among them a coffee vendor, were hurt in the crash and were hospitalized

Disruptions: Seventh Avenue between 13th and 15th streets and West 14th Street between Sixth and Eighth avenues were closed following the crash
