Stevie May is set to agree a move to Sheffield Wednesday after holding talks with the Hillsborough club and their Championship rivals Rotherham.

Wednesday matched Rotherham’s £800,000 bid for the player in midweek and they appeared to have won the race for St Johnstone’s talismanic striker.

The 21-year-old’s decision will delight Saints strike partner Steven MacLean, who enjoyed a happy stint with the Owls between 2004 and 2007 — and had already informed May that the chance to follow in his footsteps there is one he shouldn’t pass up.

‘Sheffield Wednesday would be a great move for Stevie, I’ve told him that,’ said MacLean. ‘The decision is his, of course, but I told him the fans there will love him. They love a goalscorer and a player who gives their all — he’s ideal for them.

Words of advice: Saints star Steven MacLean, right, encouraged Stevie to move to Sheffield Wednesday

‘He’s a good kid, he wants to learn and he’ll score goals in that league. If he progresses the way he has, he’ll become a top player.’

The term ‘sleeping giant’ may be something of a cliche but MacLean believes May will be blown away by the sheer size of the Hillsborough outfit.

‘They get 20-odd thousand on a bad day, and over 30,000 on a decent day — the club’s just huge.

‘It’s a Premier League club playing in the Championship. Playing there was the best time of my career. We took over 40,000 to Cardiff for a League One play-off final.

‘The potential is massive, they need to get to the Premier League again and, once they do, it will take off.’

Saints boss Tommy Wright has already tied up a loan deal for former Liverpool youngster Adam Morgan but there will be a collective need to replace May’s goals.

‘The lads are going to be sad to see Stevie go,’ admitted MacLean ahead of tomorrow’s league opener at Ross County.

‘He’s a much better player than I ever was and I scored a few in the Championship in England, so he’ll do really well.

‘Nobody will pretend we’re not going to miss him because he’s been such a massive player for us. But it’ll be up to us to help Adam Morgan when he comes in and also spread goals around the team more.’

May netted his final Saints goal in Thursday’s 1-1 Europa League draw with Spartak Trnava in Slovakia. That creditable display was rendered futile by the preceding 2-1 home leg defeat, a performance that still irks Saints.

‘We were well in the game in Slovakia and if we’d played them first out there we would have won,’ said MacLean. ‘You can’t take your foot off the pedal in Europe because as soon as your standards dip then teams will punish you.

‘We salvaged a bit of pride in the second leg but we’ve beaten a really good Swiss side (Luzern) and came up short against a decent Slovakian team.’

Saints’ domestic season begins with a trip to Dingwall tomorrow, a test that requires rapid recovery.

‘People used to wonder why Celtic and Rangers struggled after playing in Europe but now we can see why,’ said MacLean. ‘It’s tough on your body, especially for the older players, but you have to just rest up and try to recover the best you can.’
