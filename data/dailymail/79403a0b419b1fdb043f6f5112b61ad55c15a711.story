Tony Blair looks more 'Mr Red' than ex-government head as he channels his inner Tarantino in Manhattan yesterday.

The former British Prime Minister went for an afternoon stroll through New York City flanked by three besuited bodyguards in scenes reminiscent of the film Reservoir Dogs.

Wearing a dark suit and white shirt, he strode the sidewalk with purpose, protected on all sides by a detail of hired muscle.

But the casual observer could have been forgiven for assuming it was a bizarre re-enactment of the opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed 1992 crime caper - starring Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi - where the protagonists walk towards the camera each wearing black suits.

He was in New York to receive an honour from humanitarian charity Save The Children at a star-studded ceremony in the city.

Mr Blair, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of its national income on overseas aid, was given the Save The Children Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development.

There, Mr Blair hobnobbed with Hollywood stars as guest of honour at the ceremony.

Even the latest incarnation of Lassie the dog was among the guests, along with actor and director Ben Affleck, his wife Jennifer Garner and actress Dakota Fanning.

As prime minister, Mr Blair set up the Department for International Development and hosted a series of aid summits. Critics say Britain’s foreign aid budget – which hit £11.4billion last year – has led to a string of perverse outcomes, including spending millions in countries such as India which can afford its own space programme.

Accepting his award last night, Mr Blair said: ‘From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest. But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it.’

A spokesman for Save The Children said: ‘The UK’s achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid in 2014 is the culmination of work started under [Mr Blair’s] leadership.’ 

But Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, said: ‘I am not sure that giving overseas aid to China and India and setting us on the path to the biggest crash in a century is anything to celebrate.’

Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘This award is undeserved and frankly I think most British people will find it totally inappropriate that someone who has left the country bankrupt is honoured in this way.’
