For years, the Burberry check was a mark of wealth and good taste, with the beige scarf considered a useful experience that would make any outfit. 

Retailing at £315, it was a wardrobe item that was rarely seen on people without a few zeros in their bank account.

But in the late 1990's, the scarf was adopted by the Brit Pop clan, worn by the likes of Liam Gallagher, Robbie Williams and Nicole Appleton and soon became a status stamp for the cool youth.

The style has suffered since it began to be associated with 'chav' culture in the early noughties, when D-List stars including Danniella Westbrook (right) started to wear it in abundance 

But the tide started to turn against the British designer when companies started to produce imitation items featuring the recognisable square design. 

Soon knock-off Burberry check was being sold on items like baseball caps and scarves for as little as 99p across the UK. 

The turning point came in 2004, when former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook she dressed her daughter in a matching Burberry check outfit, complete with a pushchair covered in the distinctive pattern. 

By 2004, pubs and clubs across the country began  refusing entry to customers who dressed in the label.

Burberry started to remove the check from most of their items in an effort to distance themselves from customers who might give them a bad name.

The plan worked and slowly the distinctively patterned scarf has started to re-emerge as a popular accessory among A-List celebrities.

Only a week again, Adele was pictured leaving an FKA Twigs gig in London wearing a modern-version of the scarf. 

A few months ago, style icon Cara Delevingne was snapped wearing the original nineties version, while Gwen Stefani went even further in a checked raincoat.
