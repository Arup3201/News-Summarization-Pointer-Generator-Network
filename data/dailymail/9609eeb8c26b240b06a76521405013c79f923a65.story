He has covered most of the major sporting events in all corners of the world.

But now Andy Hooper, the Daily Mail’s leading sports photographer, has seen his work receive the official stamp of approval.

A special set of souvenir stamps featuring action shots taken by the 52-year-old photographer to celebrate the 2014 Commonwealth Games go on sale today.

The action shots featured on the stamps, created to celebrate the 2014 Commonwealth Games, were taken by Daily Mail photographer Andy Hooper

Andy Hooper supplied six pictures to feature on the special set of Commonwealth Games stamps. The photos were then submitted to Dutch artist Nanette Hoogslag, who used them as the basis of her illustrations

Mr Hooper who is based at the Mail’s headquarters in London, spoke of his delight at being given the commission to provide the photographs.

He said: ‘I was approached by  the Royal Mail and asked if I could supply six pictures to feature on the special set of stamps.

‘They were then submitted to Dutch artist Nanette Hoogslag, who used them as the basis of her illustrations.

‘When I saw the end result I was naturally delighted and very honoured to be involved in this project.’

The only major sticking point in the exercise was disguising the identities of the sportsmen and woman involved in the six different sports recognised on the stamps.

The photographer explained: ‘One of the stipulations was that you are not allowed to show any living  person on a stamp, so it went against the grain that the images were not sharp.

‘However, the photographs I supplied obviously were but then the illustrator got to work on them to ensure we worked within the guidelines.’

Unfortunately the Mail cameraman will not be involved when the spectacle begins next week.

He said: ‘Having just returned from the World Cup finals in Brazil, and then, the Open golf tournament, I have family holiday commitments in place.

‘But I will be there in spirit, if nothing else.’
