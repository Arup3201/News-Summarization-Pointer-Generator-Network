She's a 38-year-old successful London lawyer, banker and a mother-of-two.

He's a 28-year-old convicted drug smuggler who's serving a life sentence in Bali.

But Scott Rush and his fiancee Nikki Butler believe their love is strong enough to conquer even the toughest conditions - including a long distance relationship from Karangasem prison in eastern Bali to London.

The smitten couple got engaged in June when Rush got down on one knee in his cell and proposed to the mother-of-two

Their love story began during a Balinese holiday in 2005 when Butler met her future fiancee, just before his arrest at a Bali airport.

Ms Butler recalls the moment 'a really good looking guy' smiled at her at a bar.

'So I wondered over and that's how I met Scott Rush,' she told 60 Minutes.

'The day rolled on and we had lots more beers.

'We didn't talk too much but we had fun that day...quite hot and sweaty.'

Ms Butler waited for a phone call, which had been promised by Rush, but never heard back from him.

Consequently she lost touch with the 28-year-old drug smuggler during his years of incarceration.

So she married and had two children. But she says she was never able to forget about Rush.

Then in January last year, during her divorce, Ms Butler recognised an image of the drug criminal on British TV and contacted him straight away.

'The first thing he said to me was that "you've come along at the right time, I was just about ready to die",' she said.

Rush, one of nine Australians jailed for attempting to traffic drugs from the Indonesian island in 2005, has battled drug problems since he was sentenced.

But after being reunited with the woman of his dreams, Rush dropped to one knee and asked Ms Butler to marry him in June.

'Nikki, I love you and you love me. I think we can have a happy ending. Will you marry me?' is how he proposed.

Ms Butler says she acceptance without hesitation and doubts.

The smitten pair are certain that Rush's sentence will be reduced and they will be able to lead a happy life together.

'I'm afraid they may not want me as part of their society after being such an infamous criminal but I need to show people that my life is turning around, that I have a beautiful fiancee who wants to marry me,' he said.

'We're planning to have a good life and I want to be a productive member of society.'

Rush described his relationship with Ms Butler: 'better than lucky, almost like destiny, almost like it was meant to be'.

'She gives me butterflies in my stomach,' he said.

'It's the happiest thing I've had in my life.

'I can resist the drugs. Nikki's my drug now.'

Rush says the love he has for his fiancee is real and has nothing to do with the financial aid he's receiving from her.

'It just seems like there's a lot of sceptics out there who believe that this is some kind of hoax,' he said.

'She helps me with money but I don't feel good about taking money from her. In fact I'm willing to make up the rest of my life to be with her and make her happy in any way that I can.'

It's been more than nine years after they met for just a few hours before he was stopped with 1.3kg of the drug strapped to his body.

However Ms Butler believes he's been punished enough for the crime he committed as a teenager.

'I think his crime was stupidity and I think he's paid the price for that crime,' she said.

Rush hopes his sentence will be reduced so he can live happily with his future wife

At just 19 years of age Rush was committed to stand trial and sentenced to life in prison after hisÂ  arrest at a Denpasar airport with 1.8 kg of heroin concealed on his body.

After an appeal he was given the death penalty - which was later overturned back to a life in 2011.

Earlier this year he became the second of the Bali nine drug couriers to be moved out of Kerobokan Prison, moving to Karangasem in Bali's far east.

Kerobokan prison is awash with drugs, particularly crystal methamphetamine and heroin, with the trade controlled by local gangs. The other Australians serving life sentences in Kerobokan prison are Martin Stephens, Matthew Norman, Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Than Nguyen and Michael Czugaj.

The group's ring leaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, still remain on death row.
