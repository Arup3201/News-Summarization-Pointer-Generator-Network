South African supermodel Candice Swanepoel is using her good looks and fashion know-how to raise funds for a good cause.

The Victoria's Secret model has launched a capsule collection for MOTHER Denim in support of mothers2mothers, the charity working to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV/Aids across sub-Saharan Africa.

The 90s street style-inspired capsule collection features seven styles, including ultra high-waisted skinnies and cut-off shorts available in four washes, all modelled to perfection by Candice herself.

Victoria's Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel has launched a capsule denim collection to raise funds for an AIDS charity that was also supported by Victoria Beckham

Shot by renowned photographer Russell James, who famously photographed the Angels in the nude for his book, 26-year-old Candice shows off her toned limbs as she models her designs.

A portion of proceeds from all sales will go to mothers2mothers, which trains, employs and empowers Mentor Mothers, who are mothers living with HIV, in order to educate them how to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to babies and improve the health of women and their families.

A spokesperson for the charity said: 'A big thank you to Candice Swanepoel and Mother Denim for their generous support and this wonderful opportunity.

'Also, a big thank you to all who purchase pieces from this gorgeous collection for helping us to raise the funds we need to eliminate HIV/AIDS in children and keep their mothers alive.'

They continued: 'As a child of South Africa herself, Candice understands the importance of creating an HIV-free generation and improving the health and wellbeing of HIV-positive mothers.

'The support generated will empower more mothers living with HIV, providing them with lifesaving education and support so they seek medical care early in their pregnancy, adhere to life-saving medication, and stay in treatment for optimum health outcomes. 

'We hope everyone will support their efforts, and in doing so, save lives.'

In August last year, Victoria Beckham partnered with theoutnet.com to sell hundreds of her items of her clothing in aid of the charity.

Whether it's embellished at Balmain or tattered up at Cavalli, denim is a huge spring 2015 trend.  Candice Swanepoel puts her effortlessly chic spin on denim with a special collaboration with Mother that has a lovely charity aspect to it.  Shopping for a cause?  Count me in.

The Stunner cut is a flattering 10' rise and made with a more rigid denim to keep everything tight, taut and lifted.  Mother denim is known for their cheeky names (think The Dropout Boyfriend or The Looker) and their quality made-in-Los-Angeles fabric.  Launched in 2010, it's been a hugely popular brand that's been on everyone and their mother.

It's available right now through Mother.com but will soon be sold at Stylebop.com as well.  Check out the bottom for some more budget friendly ripped at the knee styles below.

In February this year, following an invitation from Vogue editor Anna Wintour and American Vogue to visit South Africa, Victoria met with mothers2mothers (m2m) founder Dr. Mitch Besser. 

Victoria was so moved by the experience that she wanted to do all she could to raise money and awareness. 

Speaking about the cause, she said: ‘After spending just a few days with these remarkable women and learning more about the charity from Mitch, and his lovely wife Annie Lennox, I wanted to do as much as I could. 

'It really was a life-changing experience; I’ve never experienced anything like it.’

Victoria felt that a sale of items from her wardrobe could be an incredibly powerful way to raise both money and awareness. 

The collection is available from Mother.com as well as from selected boutiques including Stylebop.com.
