Stuart Pearce has fallen out with Nottingham Forest’s owners just three days before the start of the Championship season.

The City Ground boss, who has been in charge for only five weeks, is furious at the sale of defender Jamaal Lascelles and goalkeeper Karl Darlow to Newcastle.

And in a move which has echoes of Alex McLeish’s doomed 41-day reign at Forest, he has publicly slammed the sale.

Psycho: Stuart Pearce says promotion from the Championship is no divine right for Nottingham Forest 

Never stand still: Pearce is back at the club where he enjoyed huge success as a player

Pearce spent 12 years at Nottingham Forest as a player between 1985 and 1997.

Appearances: 522 

Goals: 92

Honours: League Cup: 1989, 1990

Pearce won seven, drew nine and lost seven of his 23 games in caretaker charge of the club during the 1996/97 season.  

Pearce confirmed the two players had been sold — for a fee believed to be around £5million — and then loaned back to Forest for the rest of this season.

But he insisted: ‘The players were sold without my sanction. I can’t defend the decision to sell them because it wasn’t my decision.

‘I could sit here and lie and dress it up a little bit and cover the tracks of one or two individuals, but I’m not prepared to do that.’

The club’s Kuwaiti owner and chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi has clashed with both of his previous bosses over transfer and playing policy. And it is clearly happening again.

Pearce told BBC Radio Nottingham: ‘Last week, I was asked whether I thought the deal for them going to Newcastle was a good one, and I said, “no, definitely not”.

‘The next I heard on Monday morning was the fact that the players were sold to Newcastle.’

Forest legend Pearce returned this summer as the replacement to Billy Davies, who was sacked in March after falling out with Al Hasawi.

First choice replacement Neil Warnock turned down the chance to take over after meeting the Kuwaiti owner — even though the club were just two points off the play-offs. Warnock admitted at the time: ‘When you’ve got experience, or you’ve done the job, you’ve got to do it how you want to do it and I didn’t see that happening.’

McLeish had voiced the same concerns when he quit in February 2013, and the club’s fans will fear that a new campaign has blown up before it has even started.

Forest face Blackpool at home on Saturday and Pearce is sure to want talks over his position before then.

As if to prepare himself for the rigours of his new job — both on the pitch and in the boardroom — the 52-year-old has completed a five-day survival course in the Highlands.

‘We just pitched up for five days in the wilds of Scotland with two ex-Marines,’ he said. ‘It was brilliant, absolutely brilliant. We learnt survival skills, shelter-building, skinning hares.

‘To be fair the other people came from such diverse parts of the world that only two knew (of me). There was a fella from Dublin, one from Southampton, myself, an ex-Marine from Alaska, a policewoman from Melbourne and a Chinese fella from the tourism industry. 

All smiles: The former England Under 21 boss is hoping for City Ground success alongside Steve Wigley 

‘Within a day we were in a shelter we had built ourselves in a wood glade with a camp fire chopping up bits of rabbit to cook for dinner that night. It was great fun.’

But any suggestion ‘Psycho’s’ time in the wild taught him anything about himself is firmly, if politely, dismissed.

‘You’re permanently hungry on a survival course and you prioritise keeping warm and eating. That’s it,’ he shrugs. Pearce’s first task on returning to the City Ground was to tell his players and staff to forget the expectation that comes with being double European champions.

‘I hate the “sleeping giant” tag,’ he snaps. ‘I addressed all the players and staff in May and told them to forget that. Why do Forest have any more right to promotion than another club?

‘The part of my life as a player at this club was fantastic, but when the first ball’s kicked on the first day of the season, that finishes.

‘I’m not naive. But I hope that when we do part company, the club are back in the Premier League.’

The wearied look that marked the end of Pearce’s England 21 coaching tenure has gone. Yet he laughs at the suggestion he might have pined for the intensity of club management after leaving the Manchester City job in 2007.

Pearce admits, however, that Forest was one of the few roles that would have enticed him back to domestic football.

‘I didn’t miss it,’ he says. ‘I loved international football. You end up winning the majority of your games while you enjoy Christmas instead of fire-fighting week-in, week-out and you’re working with the best players in England.

‘I’ve been managing and coaching for 12 years. It meant a lot to represent the FA and I thought: “How am I going to replicate that feeling I had representing England?”

‘Forest was one of the clubs I felt would stoke me up again. I’d rather go to work having that feeling about myself than do it just to get paid.’
