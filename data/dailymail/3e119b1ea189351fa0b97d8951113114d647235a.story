Police surrounded the SeaWorld float at the Rose Parade in California yesterday - as protests against the organization's alleged treatment of animals waged on.

Nineteen animal activists, including a 12-year-old girl, were arrested at the parade in Pasadena as they allegedly attempted to stop the float from moving along the course.

Their outrage follows the release of a documentary, Blackfish, which claims that SeaWorld mistreats Orca whales. Activists have since demanded that the theme park shut down its killer whale shows.

On Wednesday, the park presented a float showing a boy diving into a sea of ocean creatures, including a family of killer whales. SeaWorld said it celebrated the beauty of sea life.

The protest against it was organized by PETA, which recorded officers around the float arresting 19 demonstrators, including seventh grader Rose McCoy, from New York.

McCoy also jumped a barricade at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York to protest against SeaWorld's float.

The straight A student said she wanted to take part in the New Year's Day protest after Blackfish had informed her opinions.

'I want every family to know Sea World is a cruel industry,' she told KCAL9.

'I've always been against animals in captivity. I do not think animals are here for humans. So Blackfish was very educational for me.'

Her mother, Emily McCoy, was also arrested Wednesday and said she had nothing but pride for her passionate daughter.

In total, 33 people were arrested at the Tournament of Roses parade. One woman who opposes gay marriage organized another protest.

The protesters were arrested on charges of interfering with a special event, the Pasadena Police Department said.

Blackfish, which was released earlier this year, explored the killing of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010. The six-ton whale who killed her, Tilikum, was involved in two prior fatal attacks.

Wednesday's protests are part of a continued backlash against SeaWorld. 8 out of a planned 10 music acts for the park's Bands, Brew and BBQ concert series have backed out, according to The Orlando Sentinel.

SeaWorld, which was not involved in the production of Blackfish, took out full-page newspaper ads last month, denouncing the claims made in the film.

The ads say that 'The men and women of SeaWorld are true animal advocates.' They also claim that SeaWorld is a leader in animal rescue and invests $70 million annually in killer whale care.
