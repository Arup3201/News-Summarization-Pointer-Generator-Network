Two phone calls, just moments before the front door burst open, was the only warning Maywand Osman, 20, had before his home was raided by counter-terrorism police.

He claims the early morning swoop by Australian Federal and state officers last Thursday now has him 'living in fear'.

'Every morning I get a phone call I think it's the police calling because they called that morning,' Mr Osman told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's developed a sense of paranoia and fear. It will go away in time.'

Maywand Osman claims he's 'living in fear' after being detained and then released by police during last week's counter-terrorism raids

Maywand Osman's home at Marsfield in Sydney's north-west was raided by Australian Federal Police and NSW Police and says 'it's developed a sense of paranoia and fear. It will go away in time'

Mr Osman, who still has visible bruises on his face, was detained but not arrested nor charged by police.

'Just one thing (I want to know), and that is what was the reason for the warrant and I am still to be given a reason for being detained,' he said.

When asked if he could think of any reason or incident which might have have sparked the raid on his premises, he responded: 'Not necessarily, no'.

When asked if he could think of any reason police would have wanted to raid his home, Maywand Osman said 'not necessarily, no, if would be good if they could give me a reason'

'It would be good if they could give me a reason, you know, nothing not a word, (they said) 'we have a warrant' and that's it, they came in and detained [me], that's it.

'It would be peace of mind, you know. To think they could just do that is pretty alarming.'

Mr Osman said he was asleep when two phone calls to the Marsfield home, in Sydney's north-west, were made.

'We know it was (police) because others say they got the same calls. We didn't pick up, we were sleeping. 

'You don't want to see that happen to other people.

'Yes it happened to me but I'm a bit more easy going but some people might take that the wrong way.

'I mean if they keep going into everyone's houses they are going to get backlash from the community.'

More than 800 police were involved in the pre-dawn security operation in Sydney and Brisbane

The operation was described as the largest in Australian history and resulted in the detention of 15 people and charges laid against two men

More than 800 police were involved in the pre-dawn security operation in Sydney and Brisbane, which was described as the largest in Australian history and resulted in the detention of 15 people and charges laid against two men. 

Authorities removed dozens of items from the various premises during the pre-dawn swoop, including weapons, ammunition and computer equipment.

More than a dozen homes were targeted across Sydney's west, north-west and south-western suburbs. 

Mr Osman (above) says there were two phone calls made to his apartment in the dead of night, just moments before police 'burst in'. He has visible bruises on his face and wants to know why his home was raided

Maywand Osman is unhappy at the way he was treated and the manner in which the raids were carried out. 

One of the 15 men, Omarjan Azari, 22, was charged over an alleged plot to publicly behead a random victim in a Sydney street.

'We're seeing it all over the news, people are speaking out about it,' he said.

'It's only a matter of time, we'll just have to see the way the community reacts, I guess.'

He added that he and his mother should not be living with a 'sense of fear, it shouldn't be like that'.

'They are looking for a needle in a haystack and it gives that little sense of fear but it shouldn't be there. We shouldn't be living in fear,' he added.

Meanwhile, in Westmead, in Sydney's west, the mother of Tom Dudu, watched on as her home was raided at 4am. She said the police were there to speak to her sons, aged 19 and 15.

But she defended the police's raid, and said the officers did nothing untoward.

She told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday that: 'They were just doing their job'.

And her younger son also said that authorities had not been heavy handed.

'None of that happened here,' he said.

'No, I don't think we're still being watched.'

'They were just doing their job' says the mother of two teenagers detained by police during last week's counter terrorism raids across Sydney's western suburbs

The Dudu home in Westmead was one of several targeted by Australian Federal Police and NSW Police during counter-terrorism raids but the family said today there was nothing heavy handed
