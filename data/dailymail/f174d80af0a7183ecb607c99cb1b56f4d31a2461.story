Vern Cotter fears Alex Dunbar’s season-ending injury may also rule the star centre out of Scotland’s World Cup campaign.

The Glasgow Warriors back suffered a major blow ahead of Saturday's Six Nations clash at Twickenham when he damaged the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during Thursday morning’s training session.

The SRU confirmed that he is ‘out for the rest of the season’ but, speaking before the result of scans on Dunbar’s freak injury were released, Cotter said ACL damage could mean up to six months on the sidelines and remove the 24-year-old from his World Cup plans.

How England and Scotland will line up for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash

Visibly shaken by an incident that happened just a few hours before the team flew to London, Cotter now hopes his squad will be galvanised in the face of fresh adversity for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash.

Explaining that Dunbar had been a key figure in his starting XV, Cotter said: ‘We had named Alex to start at centre but he has perhaps done his ACL this morning.

‘Alex did it on his own. A change of direction and his knee went out from underneath him. If it’s the ACL, that would be the World Cup as well. That’s not good.

‘We’ll miss him in attack and defence. He’s one of our best line breakers and has been playing very well up to now.

‘He is with some competent surgeons at the moment, he’s getting scanned. He’s understandably very upset about it.

‘We’ve seen guys come back from an ACL before, so it’s just about when we get him back. But, if it’s the ACL, he’ll be six months.

‘He was getting tested this morning. I went to see him during a break in training and he’s been whisked off with the pros. I will obviously talk to him again.’

Matt Scott has now taken Dunbar’s slot for the England game.

‘It’s an opportunity for Matt Scott, who was initially named on the bench,’ said Cotter. ‘You saw his two tries for Edinburgh last weekend, he is ready to step up. We’ve got an able replacement who has played well recently.

‘We would dearly love to have Alex starting and then have someone like Matt come in and keep pace, bring physical intensity and presence to the game. But Matt has stepped straight in, and it means we’ll have to juggle the bench if we get injuries.

‘I think it has tightened the group up – and that will be important when we play this weekend. We are playing what is probably one of the best teams in the world as they are preparing for the World Cup. The group adapts and moves on.’

Coach Vern Cotter said the 24-year-old centre had played a key role in the Scotland XV

Dunbar’s withdrawal is one of five changes Cotter has made to his starting XV. Along with Scott, David Denton, Jim Hamilton and Dougie Fife all come in for their first starts of this Six Nations, while Finn Russell returns after serving his ban.

Scott’s promotion sees Greig Tonks move on to a bench that boasts six forwards to only two backs – although No. 8 Johnnie Beattie has been told to prepare for playing a part in either unit.

Cotter revealed: ‘Beattie is a midfield replacement, emergency cover. He knows he could be marking (England centre) Billy Twelvetrees or he could be marking (No.8) Billy Vunipola.

‘I know he’s got a good boot on him. We know he’s a very skilful player. We want to have some physical density and some experience at the end of this match.

‘So he and Adam Ashe, who has come back and has aggressive defence and is good on the ball, are there to put pressure on England. We want to stay close and finish this game with strength and experience.’
