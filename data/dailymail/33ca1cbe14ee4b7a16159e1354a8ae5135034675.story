A retired Army veteran who claims to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder has been charged with threatening to shoot his wife and others  at the US Capitol in Washington D.C.

Michael Bogoslavski, whose wife works inside the Capitol as a Senate staffer, was arrested Monday after he told her over the phone and via text message that he planned to shoot her and anyone who got in his way, according to court documents.

The 33-year-old texted his wife, who he suspected was having an affair with a male Capitol police officer - he said he would shot the man and added, 'I'm going to die suicide by cop.'

The woman responded, 'You come to my job on some crazy PTSD, I will file for divorce. Your choice,' the Washington Post reported. 

Bogoslavski reportedly responded: 'When I come divorce won't help. Cause I'm making the news today.

'Gun in each hand.

'Probably won't make it all the way up but u will get my last point I will ever make. 

'Someone is going on be grieving for their family members today. Including my family. 

'I PROMISE YOU THAT.' 

Bogoslavski was arrested outside his home in Cheverly, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, without ever approaching the Capitol. 

He told investigators he had been at the gym when he sent the text messages.

Two handguns and ammunition were seized from Bogoslavski's house, court documents show.

While he was in custody, Bogoslavski told investigators he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and that he was having difficulty adjusting to life as a civilian. 

US Attorney Rod Rosenstein said law enforcement agencies 'may have prevented a tragic outcome'

The nine-year veteran retired from the Army in 2013 after serving two tours of duty in Iraq and another one Afghanistan. 

Bogoslavski was charged with transmitting in interstate commerce a communication containing a threat to injure another person. 

He was ordered detained pending trial after making an appearance in federal  court in Greenbelt, Maryland, yesterday. 

Bogoslavski's wife showed the threatening text messages to a Capitol police officer, according to the documents.

The officer then listened on a speakerphone when Bogoslavski called his wife and threatened her.

After hearing the threats, the officer alerted law enforcement to find the suspect.

US Attorney Rod Rosenstein said: 'Local and federal law enforcement agencies responded to the threat quickly and effectively.'

'Their efforts in this case may have prevented a tragic outcome.' 

If he is convicted, Bogoslavski faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison followed by three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine.
