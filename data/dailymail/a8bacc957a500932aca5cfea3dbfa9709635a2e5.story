This is the grandfather who confronted two vandals causing havoc in his local park and was so savagely beaten he feared he would be murdered.

Account manager Mark Earnshaw was almost left in a coma after he went outside his Blackpool home to remonstrate with youths who were overturning bins.

The 51-year-old was then punched and kicked, which left him nursing two black eyes, broken nose, a badly bruised jaw and a gaping wound to the side of his face after his teeth tore through his cheek during the beating.

Hurt: The grandfather has been left with a broken nose, two black eyes, impaired vision and a hole in his face

Today as police hunted the two criminals, Mr Earnshaw, who had just celebrated
 becoming a grandfather to twins, said next time he would have ignore the problem.Â 

His shocking case is similar to that of Gary Newlove, who was murdered after being kicked to death by a gang of youths when he confronted them as they damaged his wife's car outside their Warrington home.

The 47-year-old father of three suffered a massive brain haemorrhage and died in hospital two days after the attack in August 2007.

Mr Earnshaw said: 'I won't bother tackling them next time - I don't want to be another Garry Newlove.

'Obviously I don't like the senseless damage of things and it annoys me people get a kick out of smashing up the park.

'Then you then hear about what happens to other people like Garry 
Newlove who lost his life doing something like I did - and I think that 
could have been me.

'If I'd fallen to the ground unconscious and been beaten some more, my wife may have been going to a funeral this week.

'I went out without really thinking about the consequences. 
Unfortunately now I would let them get on with it next time. It's not 
worth risking my own life tackling these people in future.'

The incident occurred at 2am on March 9 after Mr Earnshaw said he had been dropped off at home by taxi after a birthday party at a social club.

Bins had been overturned at the entrance to Anchorsholme Park opposite and feared vandals were about to damage flower beds and the bowling green, as well as the children's play area.

But when the yobs became very abusive and angry, he turned to walk away, but as he did he felt a great heavy blow from behind.

He said: 'They came out of nowhere saying they were doing it because they had nothing else to do, then one of them squared up to me saying, "go on touch me".

'The best thing I thought to do was just a walk off, but I must have taken about three steps when I felt a hard thump from behind.

'He hit me again and my glasses went onto the floor. I could hardly see where they had landed so bent down to pick them up.

'They started punching and kicking me - I just thought to myself I had to stay on my feet, it was my only chance otherwise they would knock me into a coma.

'I heard my nose crack twice, the pain was unbelievable. Blood was streaming down my face, it was just pouring out. My right eye was bleeding too and I could feel it closing up.

'I was bent over trying to fend them off, shouting, 'I've had enough, leave me alone', but it just carried on.'

Mr Earnshaw eventually escaped and ran back into the safety of his home, but he was followed and the same two yobs began smashing up his neighbour's car.

Mark was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital and then transferred for special surgery at Preston Royal Hospital to stich up the hole in his cheek.

'You could have stuck your little finger through my cheek, I couldn't believe it when I looked in the mirror, I was a mess.

'It frustrates me that these thugs have ruined what was supposed to be a happy time in our lives - the birth of our two grandsons who were born earlier that evening. I haven't even met them yet - I don't want to be bruised and battered in their first photograph with me', he said.

Local Tory councillor Tony Williams, ward councillor for Anchorsholme, said: 'I'm shocked a good neighbour's act has turned into violence by mindless idiots.

'As much as I understand Mr Earnshaw's great deed it shows how dangerous it can be when you try to stop mindless thugs.

Lancashire police are now hunting two people in connection with the attack.

Police said one was aged 17 to 21, of skinny build, between six feet and 6ft 3in tall, with short dark hair and wearing grey tracksuit bottoms.

The second youth is believed to be the same age and build, between 5ft 9in and 5ft 11in, has a reddish face and was wearing white Adidas trainers.

Det Sgt Jane Atkinson said: 'This was a nasty, unprovoked assault and we're doing all we can to find the two people responsible.'
