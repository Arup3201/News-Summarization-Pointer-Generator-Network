A pregnant woman was in hospital today after being stabbed repeatedly on a footpath in the grounds of a Merseyside school.

Emergency services were called at around 12.30pm yesterday after reports that a woman had been stabbed at Lister Infants School in Tuebrook.

When officers arrived they found the 28-year-old with multiple stab wounds to her leg and upper body.

The expectant mother was taken to hospital in a 'serious but stable' condition, where doctors carried out tests on her unborn baby.

Ultrasound scans appeared to show the baby was not harmed and the victim was said to be much improved, sitting up in bed just hours after the incident.

It was understood the depth of the wounds did not appear to have injured the baby and the woman was kept in hospital for observation.

Her condition was today described as 'stable'.

A shocked parent whose son attends the nursery at the infant school said: 'When I heard what had happened I felt sick. I’ve never seen anything like it, it’s a brilliant school. I’m praying that she’s OK and the baby as well.'

The woman was attacked on a walkway within the grounds of the school but well away from classrooms. Officers are still working to recover the knife and no weapons were recovered at the scene.

Police are also checking to see whether the stabbing is linked to an argument at the school involving two mothers in the past month.

Jean McEwan, headteacher at the school which has more than 200 pupils on roll, moved quickly to reassure parents no children were caught up in what she termed a 'domestic incident'.

The school also contacted parents ahead of home-time warning they would have to use an alternative entrance to collect their children as the main access point was cordoned off by police.

In a letter given to parents yesterday Mrs McEwan said: 'There was an incident at school at lunchtime involving a parent.

 'This was a domestic incident which did not involve any of the children. I would like to reassure you that all the children are safe and the matter is being dealt with.'

And a school spokesman said: 'We can confirm an incident took place within the perimeter of the infants school at lunchtime on Thursday.

'No pupils or teachers witnessed the incident and police were on the scene very quickly.'

Last night a 39-year-old woman from the Stoneycroft area was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder at a house in Tuebrook.

Detectives cordoned off the building while forensic teams searched the property.

Detective Inspector Martin Earl said: 'This was a despicable attack on a vulnerable lady, who has been taken to hospital for treatment.

'This must have been very distressing for anyone who saw it and I would like to reassure residents that this type of incident is isolated and was not related to the nearby school.

'However, there may have been parents in the area who are able to assist our investigation.'
