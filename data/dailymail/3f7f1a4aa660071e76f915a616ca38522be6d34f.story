One in four Americans who have signed up for Obamacare using the glitch-prone HealthCare.gov site may not be insured in time for the beginning of new year due to errors, it was revealed Friday.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) announced that some 25 per cent of insurance applications filed on the Internet market exchange in October and November could contain mistakes.

According to officials, many of the glitches with have since been resolved, but the current error rate still hovers around 10 per cent.

The Obama administration has urged any applicants who used the HealthCare.gov portal to sign for health coverage to contact their insurance provider immediately, ABC News reported.

If no record of their application could be found, people will have to start the enrollment process from scratch.

Between October 1, when the Obamacare website was unveiled, and December 2, more than 155,000 signed up for insurance through the error-plagued federal exchange.

CMS is still struggling to resolve technical snafus having to do with the so-called 834 forms that are sent to insurers.

As Fox News explained, the forms provide insurance companies with essential information about clients, including their name, address, contact information and Social Security number.

CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille said some applications may not be generated from the system; others are erroneously duplicated, while some forms may contain incorrect data about the applicants’ family members.

According to Batallie, CMS has put in place a 'more rigorous monitoring system' to make sure that 834 forms reach insurance companies containing accurate information going forward. 

Uninsured Americans have until March 1 to sign for a health care plan to avoid paying a fine, but the coverage is supposed to be effective as of January 1.

People who have successfully signed up for insurance are supposed to receive a letter from their provider requesting payment.

Figures cited by the Washington Post show that close to 27,000 people signed up from October 1 through November 2.

The one-in-four error rate could mean that some 6,750 applicants may not be able to use their insurance on the first day of the new year.
