David Cameron's brilliant but eccentric guru and friend Steve Hilton was known for padding round No 10 in bare feet and scruffy tracksuit bottoms.

Although stuffy Whitehall mandarins frowned, they were powerless to stop him roaming shoeless along the corridors of power looking  more like a beach bum than a political strategist.

But it was a different story when Mr Hilton, who moved to his beloved California last year, tried to board an aircraft in the US in the same style recently.

Steve Hilton was stopped and told he was not allowed to board a plane without footwear

Having spent the morning on the beach, he didn't bother to put shoes on for the flight.

But when he tried to board the plane with wife Rachel Whetstone, a Google executive, and their two young  children, he was stopped and told he was not allowed to do so without footwear, even in California.

Reports of what happened next vary. According to one, he became embroiled in a heated row with officials who refused to back down until he paid a $200 surcharge to get on board.

According to another, he  persuaded an employee at the airport to give him a pair of shoes, even though they were far too big, and scrambled inside just before the cabin doors were due to close.

The son of Hungarian immigrants, Mr Hilton, 44, was an Oxford University contemporary of Mr Cameron and the architect of the campaign to bury the Tories' 'nasty party' image.

He left No 10 to work at Stanford University in California last year, but returned in the summer to help write the Prime Minister's party conference speech. The airport incident is not the first time Mr Hilton has been involved in a heated exchange. One of the reasons he  left No 10 was his frustration with officials who disliked his radical policies as much as his idiosyncratic fashion sense.

During one spectacular bust-up with Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the Civil Service, Mr Hilton yelled: 'You f***ing lied.'

Mr Hilton had called for the 440,000-strong organisation to be cut by 70 to 90 per cent, with bureaucrats' work handed over to private companies instead. He claimed that if Whitehall was as efficient today as it had been at the height of the British Empire, there would be no more than 4,000 civil servants.

In a defiant message aimed at Mr Hilton, Sir Bob fought back on Twitter, saying: 'I am a champion of change in the Civil Service but I will also defend what is good about it.

'We need to hang on to our values of integrity, honesty, objectivity, impartiality.'

Mr Hilton's impatience got him into more trouble when he accompanied Mr Cameron to a Tory conference in Birmingham. The prickly aide was marched off in handcuffs and fined £80 after a row with a ticket inspector and police at New Street Station.

Attempting to rush home after the event, he had a valid ticket, but failed to produce it on time. During the dispute, Mr Hilton shouted the word 'w****r', leading to him being detained in a police cell.

A statement from British Transport Police said that 'once the man had calmed down', he had been issued with a penalty notice for disorder under Section 5 of the Public Order Act. Mr Cameron had just delivered a speech - which Mr Hilton had helped to draft - in which he  condemned the 'culture of incivility' towards the police.

Mr Hilton is widely believed to have inspired the balding, pretentious character Stewart Pearson in the BBC's popular political satire, The Thick of It.

A friend said: 'Steve is one of the nicest blokes you will ever meet,  but he can't stand the jobsworth  mentality.' Mr Hilton was not available for comment.
