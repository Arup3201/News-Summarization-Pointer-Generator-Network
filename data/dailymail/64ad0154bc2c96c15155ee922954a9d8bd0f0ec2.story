Daniel Sturridge will spearhead England’s attack in Manaus on Saturday night with his position as Roy Hodgson’s No 9 beyond doubt. I played and trained with him at Liverpool and watched him develop further this season under Brendan Rodgers. Here’s why Italy may have a problem on Saturday night.

He was, in my opinion, the finest finisher in the Barclays Premier League last season. He only had the seventh best conversion rate (24.7 shots per goal) of the 18 players who scored more than 10 — Rickie Lambert was top with 16.1 — but Daniel was electric.

The biggest compliment I could pay him is that whenever he got a sight of goal, I had no doubt he would finish it off. There were all kinds of finishes, ranging from the spectacular — think of his chip against West Brom at Anfield last October — to the tap-ins all strikers thrive on.

Only against Arsenal in the FA Cup did he miss chances you’d expect him to put away. He was off-target against Honduras in the final warm-up game but he is a forward with confidence and belief. The value that adds to a team is huge.

He’ll relish this stage. If England go  far, he could be an outside bet for the Golden Boot.

Dancing to his tune: Sturridge's celebration was seen more than a few times last season

When he signed for Liverpool in January 2013, we knew there were questions about his attitude. If that hadn’t been the case, we wouldn’t have got him for £12million. Had his reputation been good, Liverpool would have paid £30m for a striker of his quality.

But I was happy Brendan Rodgers was prepared to give him a chance, as he was what we were looking for — a young, English lad with pace and ability. I honestly couldn’t fault him during the six months that I worked with him. He was always a good lad in the dressing room and took his job seriously.

Even now when I watch from afar, he comes across well in the interviews he gives and says the right things about wanting to improve.

There used to be ‘arguments’ between him and Raheem Sterling at Melwood over who was quickest and I’m sure they are continuing in training with England. What isn’t up for debate is the fact that Daniel has pace to burn.

Speed frightens defenders more than anything and, if Daniel uses his properly, it could be a potent weapon for England. He has a change of a gear to get in behind top defences, as he showed when racing on to a Philippe Coutinho pass to score against Arsenal in February.

He is quick off the mark and can leave people trailing. I felt at times he was conservative about how and when he made runs. If he is aggressive, it will give him another edge.

If he had Wayne Rooney’s mentality, Daniel would be almost unstoppable. Wayne is the type of player who will play through the pain barrier and won’t let a niggle keep him out of the action. Luis Suarez is another who stays away from the treatment room at all costs.

There was a feeling with Daniel that everything had to be right for him to play. If a knock played on his mind, he would want it assessed to be sure he could play but in a World Cup you don’t have time to stop and think.

You must play when you are not 100 per cent fit, you have to carry the bumps and bruises and put yourself on the line. If he can do this in the years to come, you could see him blossoming into one of Europe’s best strikers.

Carry on regardless: Sturridge has to learn to play when he is not 100 per cent fit

His goal record is outstanding — of players at the World Cup only Luis Suarez, Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Costa, Lionel Messi and Saturday’s opponent Ciro Immobile bettered his tally of 21 league strikes last season. But there is much more to him.

I knew from his early days in training he was a class act. It was the way he opened up his body to receive a pass, how he transferred his weight from one foot to another and moved quickly into position that struck a chord.

Some may say he is one-footed but left-footed players tend to be the ones with most natural ability. No question he has ability, now Daniel must make the most of the opportunity in front of him.
