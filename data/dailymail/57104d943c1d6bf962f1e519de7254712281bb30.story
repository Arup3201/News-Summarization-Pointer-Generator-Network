An Indonesian baby has been born with a huge tumour on the right side of his face, causing his head to become heart-shaped.

Muhammad Nafi, who is two weeks old, has a massive growth which has been increasing in size rapidly since before he was born.

He has been left with a drastically swollen and misshapen head.

Now, his parents are desperately trying to raise money to pay for him to have treatment.

Muhammad is the second child of mother Mailani, 22, and father Buasin, 32, who works as a farmer in a remote and isolated area of West Kalimantan.

‘I am confused of what I have to do with my son. I can only submit myself to the fate,’ Mrs Nafi said.

Muhammad is currently being cared for at St Antonius Hospital in Pontianak, the capital of West Kalimantan province.

He was born weighing a healthy 7lbs with the help of a midwife.

His mother said she experienced no major problems during her pregnancy, although she did feel nauseous from the fourth month onwards.

However, because the couple live so far from a hospital, she was forced to rely on medicine from small shops in nearby villages.

Mr Nafi said: ‘Well, what else should I do? I'm completely flustered. I can only be resigned to accept it.

‘At first my son was hospitalised in Sukadana in Kayong Utara Region, then he was referred to be taken care at a hospital in Ketapang Region.

‘There, they couldn't do much for my son's disease either. Therefore, we took our son to the Regional Public Hospital (RSUD).’

The tumour has prevented part of Muhammad's skull forming properly meaning surgery to remove it would leave his brain exposed

However, unhappy with the treatment their son received there, the couple transferred him to St Antonius.

The parents are now trying to raise funds to pay for the growth to be removed, although surgery will have to be delayed until Muhammad is at least three months old.

At present, the operation is considered too risky as the tumour has left the baby's skull open and unformed on the right half of his face, leaving his brain exposed.

The tumour has affected the functioning of Muhammad right eye, but more extensive examinations are needed to see if his other organs are working normally.

‘Hopefully my son will be recovered soon,’ Mr Nafi said.

‘Some people have already helped, but it isn't enough yet. In fact, there hasn't been any help from the local government of Kayong Utara Region.’

MailOnline is attempting to establish where donations can be sent.
