Giving evidence: Mr Thompson will be questioned about what he knew of the allegations surrounding the disgraced TV presenter

Former BBC director-general Mark Thompson and current CEO of the New York Times company has flown in to London give evidence to an inquiry about an aborted investigation on Jimmy Savile's campaign of sexual abuse.

Mr Thompson, who has just begun his new role, will give evidence about the shelved Newsnight inquiry to the Nick Pollard inquiry at hearings in the offices of Reed Smith in central London.

Mr Thompson is expected to be quizzed about exactly what he knew about the allegations surrounding the disgraced television presenter.

He is also expected to answer questions about a letter that was sent on September 6 to the Sunday Times, denying any part in suppressing the Newsnight film, the Guardian reported.

Thompson has said that he did not intervene in Newsnight's Savile investigation, which he was first made aware of at a party a year ago.

He asked about the status of the Newsnight film and said he was told by Helen Boaden, the BBC director of news, that because it had been dropped there was nothing to worry about, the Guardian reported.

But after lawyers acting for him sent a letter to the Sunday Times in early September, threatening to sue the paper for libel if he was accused of editorial interference, critics say this implies that Thompson knew more about the Savile abuse allegations that he initially let on, the Guardian reported.

Thompson says he verbally agreed to the 
letter going out, but claims he does not recall reading it or cannot 
remember if he was even shown it.

But advisers to Thompson say the idea behind sending out the letter came from the BBC's press and legal departments, and that its purpose was only to deny that the director general had exerted any pressure on Newsnight to drop the Savile film, the Guardian reported.

The scandal of Savile: The Pollard inquiry is looking into the handling of the Newsnight investigation

They say the letter was 
suggested by BBC press and legal departments, and its aim was to deny 
that the director general had pressurised Newsnight to drop the Savile inquiry and does not imply that he knew more than he had said.

Pollard, the former head of Sky News, said the inquiry has received 40 written submissions and conducted 12 interviews so far, but has more to conduct.

He later said he 
had a 'chance meeting' with a journalist who mentioned the Newsnight 
investigation into Savile, but said he had not been told any of the 
details or the scale of the problem.

The
firm's leading paper, The New York Times, has maintained its confidence
in the new chief following news that Mr Thompson's successor, George 
Entwistle, the director-general of the BBC, had resigned on Saturday.

Entwistle
took the blame for a news program on the BBC's Newsnight programme, 
which aired a mistaken allegation that a former British senior 
politician sexually abused a child at a care home.

Despite the furore around allegations about the handling of the Savile investigation, Mr Thompson's new employer has maintained its confidence in the new chief following news that his successor, George Entwistle, the director-general of the BBC, has resigned.

Entwistle took the blame for a news program on the BBC's Newsnight programme, which aired a mistaken allegation that a former British senior politician sexually abused a child at a care home.

Entwistle's departure and his acceptance of responsibility for editorial decisions as director-general, adds pressure to any evaluation of Thompson's role at the BBC and whether he was ultimately accountable for the shelving of the Savile report.

A BBC spokesman said: 'The Trust has asked that the letter be submitted to the Pollard Inquiry. It would be inappropriate to comment on matters that relate to legal advice.'
