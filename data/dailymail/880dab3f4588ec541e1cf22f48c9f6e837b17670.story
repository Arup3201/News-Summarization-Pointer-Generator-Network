A 42-year-old Pennsylvania mom is facing multiple charges for allegedly having sex with a boy she met at a high school football game, where she was volunteering as a 'cheer mom'.

Suburban housewife Iris Gibney, of Pottstown, is accused of having sex with the 17-year-old in her car after being sprung by police.

The two were illegally parked at Hollenbach Park on November 15 about 10.30pm, after the park was closed.

A passing officer stopped and approached the car, only to find the two naked inside, according to NBC Philadelphia.

Charged: Iris Gibney, 42, turns herself in Tuesday in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, after allegedly being caught by police naked and performing a sex act on a 17-year-old boy in her car

Obscene: Gibney has been charged with Corruption of Minors, Disseminating Obscene Materials to a Minor, and Trespass by Motor Vehicle

Gibney was allegedly performing a sex act when the officer got to the car.

The two put their clothes on and got out of the car, with the officer noticing Gibney was significantly older than the male. 

The student later admitted to police he met Gibney at a Pottsgrove High School football game earlier this year.

Gibney's daughter is on the cheer squad and she volunteers as a 'cheer mom', who go to games to support the squad and often carpool. 

Gibney and the student - who attends Pottsgrove High School - would communicate on Twitter and in chat rooms, police say.

A follow-up investigation with the student and his parents showed that Gibney had sent text messages to the student that contained explicit images.

Both Gibney and the student surrendered their phones as part of the investigation. 

The also student provided police with a written statement. 

It's understood Gibney is married with three children.

She works in retail at the Victoria's Secret in King of Prussia.

Gibney turned herself in on Tuesday and was captured by WPVI going into Montgomery County police station.

Freed: Gibney posted a $50,000 bond on Tuesday and was free to go

Housewife: The Pottstown woman is believed to be married with three children

Gibney has been charged with Corruption of Minors, Disseminating Obscene Materials to a Minor, and Trespass by Motor Vehicle.

She was freed after posting $50,000 unsecured bail.

Gibney then returned to her job at Victoria's Secret on Tuesday night.

According to the arrest report obtained by NBC, Gibney said to officers when she was caught: 'I’ve never been in trouble before. I can’t believe I did this. I have three children of my own — I am so, so sorry.'

She will front a preliminary hearing on December 30.
