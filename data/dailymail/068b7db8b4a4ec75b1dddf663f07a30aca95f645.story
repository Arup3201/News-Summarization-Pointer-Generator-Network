You will often hear supporters chant the name of their club, their favourite player — but their favourite formation?

That is exactly what you would have heard had you been at Loftus Road on Saturday.

Frustrated Manchester United fans were screaming ‘4-4-2’ as they watched their side, who were playing a 3-5-2 formation, struggle to break down Queens Park Rangers. Louis van Gaal eventually altered his formation — and it worked a treat. Within minutes of switching to 4-4-2 Marouane Fellaini scored the opener in the 58th minute before fellow substitute James Wilson sealed victory in added time. So was United’s win down to their travelling support? Manager Van Gaal says not.

This was only the second clean sheet for United in nine away games. The other came against Tottenham. 

‘I have to look at the players and communicate with the players and observe the players,’ said the Dutchman. ‘I cannot observe the fans because how many fans do Manchester United have?

‘All over the world we’ve got 600 million. You cannot take into account 600 million opinions.

‘Before this match I had already thought about this shape. Then I look to my players in a training session and I look to my game plan and then I choose.’

Radamel Falcao, back after being axed for last weekend’s home defeat by Southampton, had the chance to reassert himself in Van Gaal’s plans but it did not quite go according to plan.

The Colombian missed a glut of glorious chances to prove himself, as Van Gaal had demanded. 

Nevertheless, the United boss said he was more than satisfied with the striker’s contribution. ‘I was very pleased,’ he said. ‘Every player gets his time, no matter who. We’ll wait and see.

‘The Falcao questions are not relevant. You can’t always give the credit to the most expensive player.

‘If a young player never gets a chance I’m not a very good manager. I have to treat all players with the same rules and demands.

‘It’s difficult because the outside world is thinking when you pay a lot for the player you have to put him in the squad.’

Falcao said: ‘It was 90 very important minutes for me. I need to play and I am very happy that I did. Obviously, I really hope to score soon, but the opportunities will come. I am playing without any fitness problems.’  

Manchester United have lost just once in 20 league games in London, winning 12 and drawing seven
