A tiny typographical error may have been what led to a plutonium waste barrel packed at Los Alamos National Laboratory to explode, leak through the ground and contaminate 22 workers early this year, says a new report.

An order to use the wrong type of kitty litter in the barrels is the likely culprit and thousands of other barrels were packed with it.

The Santa Fe New Mexican reported last week the unbelievable bumbling that made a minor mixup into a massive problem at America's only permanent nuclear waste dump.

Oops: The Wast Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico was the site of a radiation leak that contaminated 22 employees--all thanks to typo that led to Los Alamos National Laboratory to pack thousands of nuclear waste barrels with the wrong kitty litter

An investigation into the weeks and months leading up to the February 14 rupture outside Santa Fe revealed a man in charge of ensuring the waste at Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is safe chalked the whole thing up to two little letters.

'General consensus is that the "organic" designation was a typo that wasn’t caught,' Mark Pearcy wrote to his chief nuclear engineer David Freeman back in May.

However, those letters meant that up to 5,565 barrels would be mistakenly packed with a wheat-based kitty litter instead of a clay-based one.

According to the Santa Fe New Mexican:

'LANL has never publicly acknowledged the reason why it switched from clay-based litter to the organic variety...'

That's a lot of barrels: Up to 5,565 barrels were packed with the wrong kitty litter and sent to the dump a half-mile underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (pictured)

Previous findings by government regulators suggest the waste drum--along with 15 others--contained a volatile mix of nitrate salts and organic matter that ruptured the barrel after it was placed in a vault half a mile underground at the plant. 

Such a mix was shown to be 'inherently hazardous' in a 2000 study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

But flawed procedures at Los Alamos fostered a culture 'that permitted the introduction of potentially incompatible materials' in waste drums there, according to the report by the U.S. Energy Department's Office of Inspector General.

The lab's 'waste processing and safety-related control procedures should have prevented the addition of these potentially incompatible materials. However, the process failed in this matter," federal inspectors said in the report.

At the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, officials are working on a plan to decontaminate the mine and seal off the rooms with the suspect waste. Moniz has said it could take up to three years to reopen the multi-billion-dollar site. 

Officials at the Los Alamos national Lab (pictured) have not said what led to the dangerous mistake. Sixteen of the barrels are believed to contain the chemical elements that led to the explosion at WIPP in February

The New Mexico facility switched from a clay-based to a plant-based litter, which caused a drum to leak in February

A report from the Santa Fe New Mexican out last week details the bumbling--including an order for the wrong litter--predating the leak

The barrels containing the organic litter are also mislabled and say they contain inorganic litter
