When Kolo Toure's name was included on the Liverpool team-sheet, their supporters could have been forgiven for being apprehensive.

After all, the increasingly error-prone centre half was up against Cristiano Ronaldo, one goal away from becoming the joint-highest Champions League scorer ever, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez.

And despite a couple of wobbles, Toure coped excellently, throwing himself in front of the ball and denying Ronaldo his moment of glory (or, as Twitter put it, having the Portugal star 'in his pocket').

The highlight of his performance was a barnstorming run down the left wing which brought back memories of his time as one of Arsenal's Invincibles.

After the game, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers praised his defender,saying: 'Kolo Toure was excellent. Tonight gives me great food for thought.'
