Two members of a family accused of mass incest dating back four generations have been DNA swabbed after a court ruled they had to provide evidence to detectives.

In one of the most shocking cases of child abuse in Australian history, Raylene and Betty Colt - legal names given to them by the court to protect their identity - were ordered by a magistrate to report to a Sydney police station on Friday and provide samples as detectives continued their efforts to lay charges.

An application to obtain DNA from a third family member - Rhonda - was withdrawn by police, pending further evidence from tests performed on five of her children. Three children will also be tested.

Five arrest warrants have been issued for a number of other family members who didn't appear in court.

A senior police source told MailOnline many Colts had fled to other parts of the country and a nationwide hunt is now on.

The case shocked Australia when about 40 people, ranging in age from toddlers to men and women in their late forties, were discovered living in scrubland in a NSW country town in July 2012. The name of the town has been suppressed for legal reasons.

Social workers and police were shocked to find the community living in squalid conditions. Several of the children were undernourished and most were unable to speak properly and had rarely attended school.

They had been deprived of dental and medical care and some suffered from sight issues and cognitive impairment or were severely developmentally delayed.

Others had never used a toothbrush, washed their hair, used toilet paper or bathed themselves. At least 12 children have since been removed from their relatives' care.

The children were living in filthy sheds and broken down caravans and had numerous disabilities from their inbred births, including a boy with a walking impairment and severe psoriasis, another with hearing and sight problems and yet another boy whose eyes were misaligned.

The depravity was a throwback to a pair of great-great grandparents who were a brother and sister who encouraged their children to have sex with each other as soon as they were capable.

By 2012, the five family groups comprised sisters Rhonda, then 47; Martha, 33; and Betty Colt, 46, who slept every night with her brother, Charlie. There were also two of Betty's daughters who each had children who proved to be from unions of related parents.

Betty's son Bobby, then 15, needed urgent dental work, could not talk properly, he wet and soiled his bed and his learning ability was at kindergarten level.

Police have been building a case against the adults ever since and yesterday was a major step in their efforts to lay charges.

In Parramatta Local Court on Friday the lawyer for Raylene said that access to the Colts' DNA should not be granted without her clients' consent.

'I'm arguing...that the application is not adequate and it should be dismissed,' said the lawyer, who also can't be named.

'The procedure is not one that can confirm or disprove that my client committed an offence under section 78A (of the Crimes Act).'

She added her client denied the allegations of incest, however accepted that they were listed as a 'suspect' in the police case.

Magistrate Joan Baptie quoted a psychologist's report on one of the Colt children, which cited: 'Her perception that her father is the same father as her mother and her grandmother.'

She also referenced 'homozygotic' testing, previously carried out for Children's Court proceedings, that indicated a high level of genetic similarities in the Colt family.

'It might occur in a place like Tonga where there's a small gene pool,' she said.

'Homozygosity, as I understand, it is very unusual.'

Ms Baptie later granted police permission to take DNA evidence from Betty, who is in her late 40s, and her daughter, Raylene, who is in her 30s.

She said she was satisfied that previous testing indicated that Raylene's teenage daughter Kimberly was the product of incest and that further forensic analysis was needed.

Betty had earlier objected to a DNA swab, saying: 'Everything else has been taken, the only thing I've got left is my privacy.'

She was ordered to report to Parramatta Police Station by 4.30pm.

Children's Court documents reveal the complex and alarming family tree that evolved over generations as the Colts moved around Australia.

Sisters Rhonda, Martha and Betty - along with two of Betty's children - were found to have parents who were blood relatives.

Many other members of the Colt family are thought to have died young.

Detective Inspector Peter Yeomans, head of the NSW Police child abuse squad, said: 'It's a very difficult, complex investigation where police are conducting inquires in relation to allegations of a multitude of offences.'
