Former Spurs 'keeper Kasey Keller has warned young USA full back DeAndre Yedlin that a move to White Hart Lane probably isn't right for him.

While former players usually speak highly of their old clubs, Keller has gone off the beaten track by suggesting a move to what he calls 'a tough place to go' could prove harmful to his career.

Yedlin was a star of the US national side that reached the World Cup quarter finals in Brazil and his performances there and for his club Seattle Sounders have peaked interest from Spurs.

Target: Spurs have shown interest in DeAndre Yedlin but Kasey Keller has warned against a move

Stop right there: Keller doesn't seem to think a move to Spurs is right for his countryman

But Keller says a move to Mauricio Pochettino's side might not be a good idea for the 21-year-old - or even a possibility due to paperwork issues.

'Spurs is a tricky place to play,' Keller said. 'They're a team that has a lot of turnover in players. Spurs are a team that has the money, and they are always looking for a bargain, but it's a tough place to go.'

And Keller told Goal that he only wants the best for young American footballers - hence his wariness of a move to Spurs. 

Top class: Yedlin has shown his quality on the international stage and in the MLS with the Sounders

'I just want to see young American players play regularly, week in and week out. If that's at Tottenham, great. But if it's not, then it's not the right move. It's hard to develop if you don't play.

'I'm not sure DeAndre would even qualify for a work permit. He's never started a game for the national team, [England] is a tough place to get a work permit.

'My guess would be that if Tottenham is in the race, it would be to sign DeAndre and loan him out somewhere.'

Strengthening: Mauricio Pochettino has been looking to improve a defence that shipped goals last season
