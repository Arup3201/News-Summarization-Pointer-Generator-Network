Aston Villa are close to signing Swansea City midfielder Ki Sung-yueng for a fee approaching £6million.

Paul Lambert is determined to strengthen his squad and the purchase of the South Korea international would be the club’s first significant outlay of the summer.

Borrowed: Ki was on loan at Sunderland for most of the 2013-14 season from Swansea

Ki, 25, returned from the World Cup in Brazil as one of his country’s better performers but has one year left on his contract in South Wales.

It is believed Ki, who was on loan at Sunderland last season after signing from Celtic in 2012, has held productive talks with Lambert and a deal could be completed this week.

He has not travelled with the Swansea squad for their pre-season tour to America because of his World Cup commitments.

Challenge: Lambert is determined to strengthen his squad ahead of what will surely be a tough season

He would bring technique and experience to the Villa midfield and the move indicates owner Randy Lerner is prepared to release substantial cash despite the club being up for sale.

It marks a departure from previous summer business as Joe Cole, 32, and Philippe Senderos, 29, have joined for free, while the price paid for Fulham’s Kieran Richardson, 29, was around £600,000.

Lambert also wants to offer new contracts to Holland defender Ron Vlaar, who shone at the World Cup, Fabian Delph and Gabriel Agbonlahor. All three have just a year left on their current deals.
