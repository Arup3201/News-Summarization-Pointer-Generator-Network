Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

With Colombia's exit in the World Cup quarter-finals, the scramble to sign superstar James Rodriguez has begun in earnest.

And Real Madrid are the latest club to throw their hat in the ring, at least according to Marca in Spain.

Perfect 10: Real Madrid have identified Colombian sensation James Rodriguez as their next Galactico, according to the Spanish sports daily Marca

Semi showdown: AS looks forward to the World Cup semi-final between Argentina and Holland, billing it as Messi vs Robben

Euphoria: Mundo Deportivo go with Lionel Messi on their front page, as he helped Argentina into their first World Cup semi-final in 24 years

'James 10' reads the headline on their Sunday edition, that being the rating Real have given to the 'Colombian pearl' after his outstanding performances at the World Cup.

According to the paper, they believe the Golden Boot favourite has all the attributes necessary to be a Galactico - 'class, flexibility, leadership, impact and personality.'

The top of their front cover reflects the sad news that Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano is in a serious state after suffering a heart attack.

'Football in suspense for Don Alfredo,' reads their headline, while AS report that he suffered the problems while with friends celebrating his 88th birthday.

AS lead on Saturday night's dramatic quarter-finals in the World Cup which saw Argentina and Holland advance to the last four.

'Robben challenges Messi' is how they bill Wednesday night's showdown in Sao Paulo, hailing Louis van Gaal's 'masterstroke' of bringing on Tim Krul for the penalty shoot-out.

Unsurprisingly, Catalan daily Mundo Deportivo focus on Barcelona's Lionel Messi, who was 'euphoric' after helping Argentina beat Belgium 1-0 to reach the semi-finals.

They quote coach Alejandro Sabella saying, poetically, 'Messi is water in the desert.'

But while Messi's World Cup dream lives on, it's all over for his club team-mate Neymar, who faces a race to be fit for the start of the season after fracturing the third vertebra in his back.

In Italy, the focus is on Argentina's match-winner - Gonzalo Higuain of Napoli.

He is pictured on the front of La Gazzetta Sportiva, who call him 'Golden Pipita' - that being his nickname - after he fired his country into the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in 24 years.

In transfer news, Gazzetta say that Ashley Cole's move to Roma is close to completion and Juventus are set to launch a fresh bid to sign the Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata.

Golden bite: Luis Suarez is on the verge of completing his move from Liverpool to Barcelona, according to Corriere dello Sport

Their interest in the 21-year-old is well known and Real are believed to be receptive to a deal.

Corriere dello Sport lead on Luis Suarez's impending move from Liverpool to Barcelona - 'A Golden Bite' they say, referring to the fact his reputation does not seem to have been damaged by his chomp on Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder.

They report that Manchester United are trying to push through a move for Juve's Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal.

And the transfer fest continues in Sunday's Tuttosport, who claim Juventus will bid for another Chilean, Alexis Sanchez, if one of their big players departs.

That could either by Vidal, or Paul Pogba, who is again attracting interest following some fine performances for France at the World Cup.

The Germans always win: L'Equipe reflects on Marcel Kittel's first stage win in the Tour de France

However, channelling the Godfather, they add Juve 'will only sell if there's an offer they can't refuse.'

L'Equipe in France reflect the mood of the nation over the last few days in their front page coverage of the Tour de France's Grand Depart in Yorkshire.

'In the end, it's the Germans who win' they lament as Marcel Kittel is pictured winning the first stage in Harrogate.

You won't need reminding, of course, that Germany knocked France out of the World Cup.
