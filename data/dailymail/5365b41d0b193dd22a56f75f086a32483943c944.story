Brazil made a new start in the wake of their World Cup nightmare but only after being dragged back into an old quarrel with Colombia.

Mercifully for Manchester United, new signing Radamel Falcao missed all but the last 13 minutes of another brutal encounter between these two rivals, exactly two months after their World Cup quarter-final had descended into the Battle of Fortaleza.

Neymar left the stadium – and the tournament – on a stretcher that night, and it was perhaps fitting that he should return as Brazil’s new captain to settle the rematch with a magnificent freekick seven minutes from time.

He was once again on the end of some roughhouse treatment from the Colombians who lost Juan Guillermo Cuadrado to a red card three minutes after half-time for his second bookable offence on the Barcelona star.

Four of Cuadrado’s teammates were also booked including Juan Zuniga for a foul on Neymar, having escaped any punishment in Fortaleza for the cynical knee to the back which fractured his opponent’s vertebrae.

The Brazilians were far from innocent that night either as Fernandinho and Co went to work on James Rodriguez in a game that brought a tournament high 54 fouls. It was surprising that only two of their number were booked on this occasion by increasingly beleaguered Canadian referee Dave Gantar.

So it was perhaps for the best that Falcao stayed out of the way, just nine days before he is due to make his debut for United at home to QPR following a £6m loan move from Monaco on transfer deadline day.

Colombia coach Jose Pekerman decided that it was best to put his star striker on the bench at the end of a week in which he had travelled to Manchester by private jet to complete the deal, and kept him there until the 77th minute when Falcao replaced Rodriguez to a huge ovation. However, his only notable contribution was to head a 90th minute chance over the bar.

By then, Brazil had snatched the decisive goal, Neymar curling his freekick into the top corner from the edge of the box. It was a reminder of his mercurial talent and of what Brazil lost at the World Cup following his sad exit.

Could he have helped avert that tumultuous semi-final defeat to Germany in Belo Horizonte? Could he have saved Big Phil Scolari’s job? We’ll never know. All that matters now is that he gave Scolari’s successor Dunga victory in his first game back in charge and Neymar’s first as captain. 

It was also Colombia’s first since their quarter-final defeat and they did not look like a team who were willing to forgive and forget. This wasn’t a friendly in any sense of the word.

A sellout crowd of over 73,429 in the Sun Life Stadium – tickets were apparently selling on the black market for up to $4,500 on Friday – certainly got a competitive game. The Miami Dolphins face the New England Patriots here on Sunday and it is unlikely to be any more physical.

There was just one minute 50 seconds on the clock when new Chelsea signing Filipe Luis hacked down Cuadrado. Ramires and Luis Gustavo were both shown yellow cards for fouling the Fiorentina winger, who was one of a number of players linked with United this summer, and were followed into the book by Zuniga, Carlos Valdes, Carlos Sanchez and Teo Gutierrez.

When Cudrado, who had been the first to be cautioned for bringing down Neymar, pulled back the same player three minutes after half-time he was off.

The litany of fouls, bad-tempered niggles and angry crowding of the referee by both sets of players once again denied us the chance to enjoy the skills of players like Neymar and Rodriguez.

It also overshadowed the rest of the goalmouth action that saw Filipe Luis denied by an offside flag, Zuniga send a magnificent rising shot just over the bar from 30 yards and Jefferson scoop an awkward effort from Rodriguez around the post.

The Brazil goalkeeper had been brought in to replace Julio Cesar as Dunga started his second term in charge by ushering in a new era in Brazilian football. Only 10 of the World Cup contingent made his squad this time around and only four of the line-up in Fortaleza started here. It included four Chelsea players in Filipe Luis, Ramires, Oscar and Willian.

Neymar’s late strike means that Brazil’s 1994 World Cup winning captain now has an impressive record that reads played 61, won 43, drawn 12. They won’t come any harder fought than this one.
