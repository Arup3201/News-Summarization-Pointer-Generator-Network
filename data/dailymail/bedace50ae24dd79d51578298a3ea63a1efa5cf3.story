Spanish priest: Miguel Pajares died in a Madrid hospital after contracting the Ebola virus in Liberia

The Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa claimed its first European life yesterday.

Spanish priest Miguel Pajares died five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid for expert care.

With the death toll climbing above 1,000 and the outbreak showing no signs of slowing, the World Health Organisation declared it ethical to use untested drugs to attempt to control the virus.

Mr Pajares, a 75-year-old missionary, caught Ebola – one of the deadliest diseases known to man – while treating patients in Liberia.

His condition was described as stable on arrival in Spain and it is thought he was given ZMapp, an experimental drug credited with the ‘miraculous’ recovery of two American aid workers.

His body will be cremated today to prevent the virus spreading.

Last night, two doses of ZMapp were on their way to Liberia to treat two doctors – the first Africans to receive the drug.

The development follows concern that the antibody medicine, which is grown in tobacco plants and has not been formally tested on humans, was being reserved for use on Westerners.

The Liberian government said it was aware that the drug’s safety had not been established but that it had no option but to try using it.

Information Minister Lewis Brown told the BBC: ‘The alternative to not testing this is death, a certain death.

‘This
 is not even the rock and the hard place for us. We think those who have
 been infected should be given the chance to have that tested on them if
 they give their consent to do so.’

With
 no conventional treatment or vaccine available for Ebola, and this 
outbreak being the worst ever, interest in ZMapp is high.

But production is slow and with only 12 doses made, its US manufacturer says the supply is now exhausted.

can count on their government but Guineans can only count on God in the 
face of Ebola.’

Yesterday, 
an ethics panel hastily convened by the World Health Organisation said 
that the size of the outbreak made the use of untested, and so 
potentially dangerous drugs ethical, provided certain conditions are 
met.

The organisation previously admitted that the disease, which causes internal and external bleeding, is out of control.

‘We don’t have enough people to rely on the traditional methods if we want to stop the outbreak as soon as possible.’

Dr Kent Brantly, one of the two Americans with Ebola who were given the drug, has said that he is growing stronger every day.

But it is not known if ZMapp is responsible or if he simply recovered naturally, as some patients do.
