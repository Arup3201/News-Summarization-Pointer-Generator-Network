David Cameron will travel to Brussels today to try to prevent an arch-federalist from becoming the new president of the European Commission.

After millions voted for Eurosceptic parties in last week’s European Parliament elections, the Prime Minister warned that the EU cannot simply carry on with ‘business as usual’.

He believes giving a top job to Jean-Claude Juncker – a former prime minister of Luxembourg who wants to increase the EU’s powers – would represent a slap in the face for voters.

Across the continent, Eurosceptic parties doubled their representation in the European Parliament, and now hold a third of all seats. 

Mr Cameron does not have an alternative to Mr Juncker in mind, but hopes to postpone the race to replace the Portuguese Jose Manuel Barroso until someone more suitable can be found.

Mr Juncker is standing for the centre-Right European People’s Party, which has emerged as the European Parliament’s largest single party. Mr Cameron ended the Tories’ affiliation with the EPP in 2009 over its federalist sympathies.

A Downing Street spokesman said voters would not tolerate more of the same from Europe in the wake of last week’s poll. ‘The PM has been making the point in these conversations that leaders should seize the opportunity of tomorrow’s dinner to heed the views expressed at the ballot box that the EU needs to change, and to show it cannot be business as usual,’ they said.

‘The turnout and results in the European Parliament elections have underlined the need for reform to ensure that the EU is doing more to deliver what voters care about: jobs, growth and a better future.’

The comments were backed by French president Francois Hollande, who said he would tell EU leaders that the union ‘must change to focus on jobs, growth and investment’.

The current European Commission – which is responsible for proposing and implementing new EU laws – will remain in place until the end of the year. Downing Street sources said this means the process of appointing a new president could take months. 

One said: ‘The Prime Minister will talk to the other leaders about the need for them to think about the future direction of the EU and how it needs to change in order to respond to the turnout and to the results.

They added: ‘The results underline the view of the British people and people across Europe that they want change. The EU needs to respond to this and reform.’
