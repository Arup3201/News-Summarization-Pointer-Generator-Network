Space travel seems to have lost its magic after a Russian cosmonaut dramatically quit as a commander on a future mission - to become a gasman.

Colonel Yury Lonchakov, 48, was today accused of 'betrayal' by opting for a 'more interesting job' and forgoing his chance to lead a flight to the International Space Station.

He came under pressure from his wife, ex-airline stewardess Tatiana, 40, to get find a better paid job, say sources at Star City, home of cosmonauts' training, near Moscow.

It is understood he will earn more than double his £18,396 a year salary as commander of a flight to the ISS scheduled for May 2015.

He has secured an unspecified job with Russian gas giant Gazprom, said a friend.  'Yury does not want any publicity. He told me he has already got a permanent job at Gazprom.

'He has a bank loan, and his wife was not happy with his income.

'Quitting the space industry was his personal decision. He thought he did enough in space. And he got an offer he could not turn down.'

The move by one of Russia's most senior cosmonauts, a veteran of three earlier flights, though never as commander, has shocked and saddened his colleagues who remember the allure of the role in Soviet times when it was the ultimate job - and honour. 

'He has betrayed the whole Cosmonaut Training Centre,' fumed spokeswoman Irina Rogova.

'He
 was listed as a crew member for the space flight in March 2015. He 
completed his training. The space crew is fixed two or three years prior
 to the flight. We are talking about International Space Station after 
all.

'It means we have partners. All was 
negotiated and fixed. Lonchakov was approved at all levels. Now we are 
urgently looking for a new commander. It is the first time we have such a
 shocking situation.'

She 
insisted: 'People don't become cosmonauts for money. These are special 
people. It is romantic, it's a dream, a goal. It has always been like 
this.'

No longer, it seems.

One small step too far: Russia's Soyuz TMA-13 rocket takes off carrying Lonchakov from the Baikonur cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan, on October 12, 2008

Sergei Krikalev, head of the training centre which is named after Yuri Gagarin, said: 'Space in our country has became just one of many other jobs.'

One poll found that modern Russian children would rather be doctors, teachers, and truck drivers than cosmonauts.

Russia's first-ever open cosmonaut recruitment drive attracted a mere 300 applications last year, compared with 6,000 for NASA in 2011.
