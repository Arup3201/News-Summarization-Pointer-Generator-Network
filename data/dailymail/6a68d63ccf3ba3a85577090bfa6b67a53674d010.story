YouTube is filled with useful kitchen tutorials, teaching viewers everything from how to slice an onion without shedding tears, to the easiest way to peel a boiled egg.

But there's one video which could be heading straight to the top of the 'most useful kitchen hacks' list.

'How to open a bottle of beer with a sheet of paper' was uploaded by Rhys Morgan this week, and it does exactly what it says on the tinnie.

So the next time you forget a bottle opener you don't need to worry.

Mr Morgan's method is so ludicrously simple it's a wonder no one has thought of it before. 

All you need to successfully crack open your beer is one piece of A4 paper.

Mr Morgan who lives in Cardiff, Wales starts off by vertically folding the paper in half.

He then folds the half lengthways again, pressing firmly so the creases of the paper hold.

He keeps folding the paper in half vertically until he ends up with only a small amount of paper left. 

Mr Morgan starts by vertically folding a piece of A4 paper in half (left) before he folds it in half again (right)

Then he folds the remaining paper lengthways to create a 'V' shape from the paper. 

He places the 'V'-shaped paper against the underside of the bottle and applies pressure 

And with one swift upwards move he pops the cap of the bottle, successfully releasing the beer from its bottle-topped prison. 

The 21-year-old Cardiff University student said he invented the trick when he found himself at a party with bottles of beer and a broken bottle opener.

He told FEMAIL:'I learnt the trick  during the summer.'

'I was at a garden party with, tragically, a broken bottle opener. We needed to create some kind of bottle opener, and I thought that strengthening a sheet of paper by folding it could help it act as a lever to pry the top off!'

After folding the paper thrice the forms a 'V' shape with the paper

He then places it on the underside of the bottle (left)  and in one swift move pops the cap (right) 

Success! He has managed to open a bottle of beer without a bottle opener

Mr Morgan said his trick will work with all types of paper, down to kitchen roll. 

On his account he explained:' Some people are pointing out that the paper looks thicker than standard paper.

'It's just high GSM paper printer that I happen to have at home. This trick still works fine with thinner paper, all the way down to kitchen towel.' 

His video currently has more than 350,000 views..

The English Literature student is overwhelmed by the popularity of the clip.

'I had no idea the video would ever take off like this so this is all a bit of a shock at the moment,' he said. 

Do try this at home.
