A father-of-four died of a massive caffeine overdose after eating a pack of instant-energy mints, an inquest heard.

John Jackson, 40, was found dead after he snacked on the Hero mints bought from shops close to his home – seemingly unaware he had been consuming dangerous quantities of the stimulant.

Coroner Robin Balmain recorded a verdict of accidental death, but said he would write to the Department of Health to warn of the potential danger of the mints after learning that each one contained 80mg of caffeine – around the same as a 250ml energy drink such as Red Bull.

Each tin contains 12 mints with the packets retailing for between £1.95 and £4 online, although Mr Jackson’s family say they were on sale for as little as 50p at the shops close to his home.

The former painter and decorator was found dead in his flat in Darlaston, West Midlands, in May by his estranged partner Michelle, 48.

Black Country coroner Mr Balmain said: ‘This is a potentially very dangerous situation. The level of caffeine is enormous. I think I’m as certain as I can be that Mr Jackson didn’t know he was going to expose himself to this sort of danger.’

Pathologist Dr Dragana Cvijan told the hearing it was the first time she had come across a caffeine overdose. She said that while the cause of death was caffeine toxicity, an underlying liver condition which left heavy drinker Mr Jackson unable to properly absorb the stimulant was a contributing factor.

Hero Energy Ltd, the company who produce the sweets, said they were 'very saddened by the news' vowing to look again at how they can further inform customers of the risks of caffeine

Speaking after the inquest his stepdaughter Rebecca Court, 23, called for the mints to be banned.She said: ‘On the box they said one tablet equals one can of energy drinks. A kid could go in and buy them and the same thing could happen to him.

‘Dad loved eating mints. He ate all sorts of different brands and probably didn’t realise these mints had high amounts of caffeine in them. Something should be done about them. They are very, very dangerous.’  Manufacturer Hero Energy Ltd said it felt the company took adequate steps to make customers aware of the risk posed by caffeine.

In a statement issued from its Birkenhead HQ, bosses Paul Hayes and Steve Hones said: ‘We are greatly shocked by this news and are deeply concerned.

‘Here at Hero, we fully understand the associated risk and dangers of caffeine and its consumption.

‘We are extremely vocal about these risks and highlight them at every available opportunity.’

They said each tin contained warnings about the product’s high caffeine content which said: ‘DO NOT exceed 5 Hero Mints in a 24-hour period’.

The warning also advised against consumption by pregnant women, under-16s and ‘caffeine sensitive individuals’.

Earlier this year, Dr Jack James, editor in chief of the Journal of Caffeine Research, warned caffeine was being consumed in such high quantities it was causing ‘untimely deaths’ and should be regulated.

He said while some European countries have begun to take action, including sales restrictions and product labelling, most countries including the UK and the US have a ‘regulatory vacuum’.
