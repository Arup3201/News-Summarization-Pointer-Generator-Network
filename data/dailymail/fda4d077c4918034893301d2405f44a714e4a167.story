Painful memories: Punk legend Lydon said the four-year ordeal, which began when he was just seven, was 'tortuous'

Former Sex Pistol John Lydon has spoken candidly about how a severe bout of childhood meningitis left him unable to recognise his own parents.

The punk rock legend admitted that the four-year ordeal, which began when he was just seven and living in London, was 'cruel and tortuous', as he believed it was all his own fault.

Lydon said he was incapable of remembering his own name, let alone the identity of his parents, John Christopher and Eileen, but decided he had to trust them because he had 'no place else to go'.

In tonight's revealing interview with Sky Arts: In Confidence, Lydon will discuss his dizzying success with the Pistols and the breakdown of the band, along with new tidbits about his fascinating personal life.

'Not being able to remember your own name
or your mother and father, or anything at all, and for little bits of 
that to be coming in over a period of four years, that's pretty close to
torture,' he tells interviewer Laurie Taylor.

The 56-year-old added: 'I had to believe these were my mum and 
dad. They were kind. They seemed to want me.

'The hospital did not seem 
to want me. I had no place else to go. But it was murderously cruel and 
tortuous, mostly because I thought inside it must be my fault. I must 
have done something wrong.'

Lydon, now frontman for band Public Image Ltd, has moved from anarchist figurehead of the seventies to being seen in reality TV show I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here and appearing in butter adverts.

The Pistols' 1977 anti-monarchy 
anthem God Save the Queen is being re-released this year for the second 
time on a major label to coincide with the Queen's 
Diamond Jubilee.

Lydon also speaks openly about the 
death of his stepdaughter, Arianna Foster - aka Ari Up, a member of the 
all-female punk band The Slits.

He said of Foster, who died in 
2010 from cancer: 'Arianna didn't need to die and that's a 
very, very tough burden on her mother to know that.

'She knew she had 
cancer and she deliberately ignored it and went for lunatic left-wing 
crackpot theories. And that will kill you stone dead. Every single time.

'If you want to survive something as curable as breast cancer, do not go
to the far-out loonies. But, ultimately, those are decisions Arianna 
made herself and some of us in the family think it was almost suicide.'

Lydon formed the Pistols in 1975 and kick-started the punk rock movement in Britain.

Despite releasing only one album and four singles, The Sex Pistols are regarded as one of the most influential bands of all time. They disbanded after a shambolic US tour in January 1978 and Lydon went on to form Public Image Ltd (PiL).

Lydon says he turned TV butter salesman so PiL could tour again. 'The money that came out [of the butter advert]... not an enormous amount, you know, and certainly not one to complement the 87 per cent increase in their sales – you owe me more – but [it was] enough to get PiL started up again and get some debt off my back.

'But the company treated us so well and with such respect that it was a joy working with them – really, really honest and above board, and I'd not seen that in any record company situation. Not ever.'
