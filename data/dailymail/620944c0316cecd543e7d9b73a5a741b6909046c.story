Pensioner, Ian Kelsey stole more than £750,000 from his employer to splash out on flash cars, jewellery and holidays

A finance director who stole more than £750,000 from his employer to fund a lavish lifestyle including £10,000 holidays has been jailed for four years.

Ian Kelsey siphoned off an average of £100,000 a year, over seven years, from the accounts of AM Todd, an American oil supplier.

He took up to £48,000 in a single transaction after discovering he had final authority over all payments.

The disgraced employee, from Wells, Somerset, used the cash to fund a 'high standard of living' including expensive holidays, jewellery for his wife and a fleet of new cars.

Kelsey was jailed at Taunton Crown Court after admitting 24 charges of transfer by deception and fraud.

Mr Recorder Paul Dunkels QC said the fraud was particularly grave given the degree of trust that had been placed in role as financial director.

The judge said: 'You were responsible for arranging payment and the reclaiming of VAT and in the course of this duty you discovered that you alone could sanction payment.

'You embarked upon a course of repeated theft and fraud.

'This was a very grave breach of trust having regard to the degree of trust placed in you and the number of long years you did it for.

'I have of course given you credit for being a man of previous good character but here you are at the age of 67 having lost that and facing imprisonment for the first time in your life.

'I sentence you to four years imprisonment, you will serve half and be on license for the remainder.'

Kelsey used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle of expensive holidays to Cyprus, jewellery and Mazda cars

He added that on average Kelsey stole over £100,000 a year to fund his lavish lifestyle and that there was no realistic prospect of the total £776,538.41 being repaid.

Kelsey first began to steal from AM Todd, based in Frome, Somerset, in 2003 after he started transferring highly-inflated VAT re-claims into his Halifax bank account.

Nigel Askham, prosecuting, told the court that suspicion had been cast after an HMRC official began to notice discrepancies in the claims between December 19th 2003 and February 23rd 2010.

He said: 'When the official tried to arrange a visit to inspect the business Mr Kelsey was less than helpful.

'When they finally caught up it was obvious he was in complete panic, he was red faced and at one point he even ran off.

'It was discovered that he was transferring inflated VAT re-claims from the HMRC to A M Todd’s Sterling account into his own bank account.

'He funded his high standard of living, taking £10,000 holidays to Cyprus and buying many Mazda cars, over the years.'

Rebecca Bradbury, mitigating, said that Kelsey had begun transferring the large sums of money after his hours and wages had been cut.

She said that he had initially only transferred a small amount but on realising there was no second authority checking the transactions he took advantage and increased the amounts.

He used the money to buy jewellery for his now ex-wife, who has been forced to hand back much of it during civil proceedings to reclaim the money.

Miss Bradbury added: 'Once he had begun to buy his family nice things his family fell into this expectation and he didn’t wish to disappoint anyone.

'He didn’t think through the consequences, once he found he could make these transactions all thought left him and he couldn’t explain where the money had gone.'

She added that he was genuinely sorry for what he had done and showed deep remorse and regret.

The pensioner remained emotionless as he was led from the court room to the cells.
