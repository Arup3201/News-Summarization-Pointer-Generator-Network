Authorities found the stabbed torso of Lockhart washed up in Mississippi's Hancock County in June 2012, NOLA reported at the time.

Her decapitated head and parts of her legs were found in nearby Harrison County.

Authorities were able to identify Lockhart based on her neck tattoos. Her fiance reported her missing after she did not return from a shift at a Bourbon Street club.
