According to Nielsen TV data through mid-January, the average age of Fox News viewers is 68-years-old.

In Frank Rich's New York Magazine article, 'Stop Beating a Dead Fox' he calls Fox News a politically conservative 'retirement community' that's losing young viewers at a faster rate than it's competitors.

The average viewers at MSNBC and CNN are 60, and the average is 62-64 for the broadcast networks.

The average age of viewers that watch Fox News are 68-years-old and almost all of them are white

Not only are Fox News viewers old, 
they're almost all white. Rich points out that only 1.1 per cent of Fox 
News viewers are black. That's a far lower number than other news 
networks.

MSNCB has a 25 per cent black audience and CNN has 14 per cent black audience.

Rich quips that conservative candidate Mitt Romney got more black voters at 2 per cent than Fox did at 1.1 per cent.

Fox news has made some attempts at gaining younger viewers by hiring broadcasters such as the young, blonde, and blunt Megyn Kelley.

However, Kelley failed to lure young viewers. In fact, most News networks are grasping to gain an audience from the generation that no longer hails TV as their primary news source.

Most young people read the news on the web or on their smartphones as oppose to on television.

Megyn also did nothing to draw a black audience, especially after she caused a raucous around Christmas when she said that both Santa Claus and Jesus were 'just white' on television in response to a piece Aisha Harris wrote for Slate.com expressing her desire to give Santa Clause a racial makeover.

Basically, Rich thinks Fox News caters to geriatric conservative white people and tells them exactly what they want to hear--especially politically.

Rich explains that on Election day in 2012, election data (gathered by Fox News network favourite Scott Rassmusen proven to have GOP bias in 2010) was spiked in favour of Mitt Romney. Obama ended up winning the election.

Even Romney's senior advisor, Eric Fehrnstrom, noted Fox's conservative favouritism.'We’d much rather go on a Fox program where we know the question is going to come up and Mitt can give his answer and it’s not going to a frenzy of questioning,' he said.

Rich believes the age of Fox's conservative white viewers will continue to rise.
