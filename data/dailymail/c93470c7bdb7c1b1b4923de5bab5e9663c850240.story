A Florida man who once supported George Zimmerman described Wednesday a phone call he received before Zimmerman's arrest - from someone who claimed to be Zimmerman and made a 'racial comment.'

Frank Taaffe described the phone call to the media, before his testimony to a federal grand jury, WFTV reported.

He said a man, who he said may have been Zimmerman, made a remark that was 'something that was pretty disparaging to Trayvon (Martin) and to African-Americans' after the shooting.

Mr Taaffee declined to say what the remark was. 

'The alleged person that called me up to, leading up to George's arrest, was - they claimed to be George,' he said in a video filmed by the affiliate station. 'I didn't recognize the name.'

George Zimmerman's ex-neighbor Frank Taaffe, pictured, has said he received a phone call from someone who claimed to be Zimmerman and made a 'racial comment'

He continued, 'It came from an unknown number, so you know, I just shared with them the information with my last meeting with them in July and I can't swear that it was him, because you know, anytime someone calls you up on the phone, and says they're so-and-so, you know, someone calls you up and says it's Abraham Lincoln you know it's not him because he's dead.'  

Taaffe said that the phone call came from 'an unknown destination' - and when he asked the caller to state their identity, the person claimed to be 'George.'

The phone call took place 'a couple of days before [Zimmerman's] arrest,' Taaffe also said.

After being asked about the reasoning behind coming forward, Taaffe referenced the deaths of his sons as well as his brother.

'I just felt that it might be information that they could use to - even though it's hearsay, third party, and I cannot testify under oath that that was him, cause I can only say who that person was,' he said. 

Taaffe, who reportedly testified before a grand jury on Wednesday also said the remark was 'something that was pretty disparaging to Trayvon and to African-Americans' 

Taaffe said 'This person allegedly made a racial comment,' but told a reporter he 'can't go into that right now' and needed to give his testimony.  

Taaffe said he only told his now-deceased brother about the phone call, and did not inform the authorities.

'I could not establish who the person is,' he also said. 'I can't - you know, it's baseless.'

He also claimed outside of the courthouse his testimony is 'an amends to the Martin family.' 

Taaffe mentioned that multiple people have called him in the past and pretended to be Zimmerman.
