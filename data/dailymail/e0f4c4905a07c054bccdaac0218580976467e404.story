A frenzied mob set fire to Union Flags outside the British Embassy in Buenos Aires yesterday in an ugly protest over the Falkland Islands.

More than 100 Argentinian militants marched on the building while urging their government to sever diplomatic links with London.

They bellowed insults about David Cameron and held up banners declaring: ‘England out of the Falklands’ and ‘Break ties now’.

Ugly protest: Left-wing activists are furious at remarks made by Mr Cameron accusing Argentina of being colonialist in their demands for sovereignty over the Falklands

The mob took to the streets after the
 Prime Minister accused Argentina of being ‘colonialist’ for repeatedly 
demanding sovereignty over the South Atlantic territory.

His remarks to Parliament last 
Wednesday provoked a furious response and escalated tensions ahead of 
the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War on April 2.

Riot police were mobilised to protect
 the embassy and ensure the march, led by nationalist group Proyecto Sur
 and left-wing political party MST, passed off peacefully. 

The 1982 conflict over the islands, 
when an invading Argentinian army was thrown out by a British task 
force, claimed the lives of 255 British troops and 649 Argentines.

On the march: Other banners said: 'British out of the Malvinas (Falkland Islands)' as they called on President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to cut diplomatic ties with the UK

Call for action: A protester holds a sign that reads in Spanish 'Government break the relationship now', referring to Argentina's diplomatic relationship with Britain

Tensions have risen again after the discovery of oil in the seas around the islands, which lie about 300 miles off Argentina.

Mr Cameron used his appearance at 
Prime Minister’s Questions this week to reassert that Britain would 
never hand over the Falklands – a dependency since the 1830s – against 
the wishes of the local 3,000 population.

He also revealed the Armed Forces had drawn up contingency plans for combating a threat to the archipelago.

Stinging retort: Argentine Vice-President Amado Boudou (left) said Mr Cameron's comments were clumsy and historically inaccurate

But his remarks infuriated 
politicians in Buenos Aires. Amado Boudou, acting leader while President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner recovers from surgery, said Mr Cameron 
was ignorant and told him to re-read his history books. 

Prince William is being posted to the
 islands as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot next month – a move Argentina
 attacked as ‘provocative’.

Foreign Secretary William Hague 
risked inflaming tensions in Latin America by revealing Prince Harry 
will make an official visit to Brazil next month.

Britain and Argentina fought a brief war over the islands, known locally as the Malvinas, in 1982.

Tensions between Argentina and Britain have been building in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War in April.

Argentina
 recently won the support of powerful regional trading block Mercosur as
 part of its long-running diplomatic offensive to reclaim the islands.

Neighbours Uruguay and Brazil agreed a pact to close ports to vessels carrying the Falkland Islands flag.

Brazil's
 Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota told William Hague the decision stood
 and his country continued to back Argentina's claim to the Falklands 
during a meeting in Brasilia yesterday.

The conflict claimed the lives of 255 British troops and 649 Argentines.
 After the war Britain built a fully functioning military garrison with 
an airstrip capable of accommodating any size military jets.

Forces currently based on the islands include 1,200 troops and four 
Eurofighter Typhoons, while the surrounding seas are patrolled by the 
frigate Montrose, the offshore patrol vessel Clyde and survey ship 
Protector.

Frictions between the two countries intensified in 2010 when 
British firms discovered oil offshore in the North Falklands Basin.

Last month tensions erupted after the Mercosur trade bloc – Argentina, 
Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil – agreed to block ships that flew the 
‘illegal’ Falklands flag.

The dispute overshadowed the first official 
visit by Mr Hague to Brazil. He conceded Britain and Latin America 
disagreed but said: ‘We believe in the self-determination of the people 
of the Falklands.’

Last night former military top brass raised serious concerns about 
whether Britain would be able to defend the Falklands amid sweeping cuts
 to the Armed Forces.

General Sir Peter Whiteley, a former commandant general of the Royal 
Marines, said: ‘If the Argentines decided to invade again we could never
 consider trying to take them (the Falklands) back because of our lack 
of naval resources.’

And Surgeon Rear Admiral Ralph Curr, the Royal Navy’s former medical 
director-general, added: ‘There’s no way we could defend the Falklands 
or re-engage the Argentines if it all happened again.’
