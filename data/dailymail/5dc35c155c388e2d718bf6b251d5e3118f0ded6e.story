Former trailblazing model and restaurateur Barbara Smith is opening up about her battle with Alzheimer's in a new interview.

Speaking with Al Roker, Smith said of the moment she was diagnosed; 'I had tears in my eyes. But at the same time I also said, "I’m not going to give to it. I am going to fight."'

Her husband meanwhile said the news was difficult for him as well, especially seeing his wife suffer.

Said Dan Gasby; 'If anybody didn’t deserve this it was this woman because she is the sweetest human being, bar none. And then, after you curse God, you apologize.'

Now the two have been faced with bigger challenges, especially after an incident in which Smith disappeared for 17 hours last November, and was ultimately found at a Manhattan diner. 

'I thought I lost her,' said Gasby. 

'I thought I lost her. It was like living in a nightmare, but you’re awake.'

Walkabout: Smith's husband, Dan Gasby, revealed on Facebook that his wife walked from Midtown Manhattan to Harlem, then to Battery Park. She took the ferry to Staten Island where she rode a bus and then boarded the ferry again to return to the city. Finally, Smith walked to La Parisienne diner on Seventh Avenue

The two appeared on Today to get more people, especially minorities, to help with research and to sign up for clinical trials. 

Smith has even taped a PSA for the Brain Health Registry urging people to enroll in trials and take cognitive tests.

This after the incident last November in which she went missing on Long Island and wandered around Manhattan for hours, even taking a ferry to Staten Island, before she was found in a midtown diner.

Smith's husband and business partner, Dan Gasby, posted a message on his Facebook page  seeking to clarify the circumstances surrounding his wife's disappearance shortly after the incident..

'Just for the record here's what B experienced so there are no rumors: B walked from midtown to Harlem to battery park took the ferry rode a bus in Staten Island then the ferry again walked to la parisienne on 7th w58 across from our old address where a friend happened to see her!' 

Barbara 'B' Smith, 65, had last been seen in Southampton, Long Island, at around 8pm Tuesday, according to Dan Gasby.

Gasby told MyFox NY that his wife took a jitney from New York City to Sag Harbor, where the couple own a home and restaurant, but got off in Southampton about 10 miles from her final destination. 

The news station 7Online reported  that the multitalented entrepreneur, cookbook author and TV host got back on the Ambassador Jitney and returned to Manhattan, where she eventually ended up at the La Parisienne diner on 7th Avenue after walking halfway across Manhattan and taking a ferry to Staten Island and back.

The owner of the cafe, who is a friend of Smith's, recognized the TV presenter and contacted police, according to the New York Daily News. 

According to published reports, Gasby's grown daughter, Dana, helped bring B. Smith home by tracking down the driver of the jitney on Long Island. 

Ms Gasby, who is the general manager at B. Smith's Restaurant in Manhattan, shared pictures on her Facebook depicting her stepmother cuddling on the couch with a black pit bull puppy named Sasha soon after her harrowing ordeal.

A native of Pennsylvania, B. Smith began her career as a fashion model, becoming the first African-American woman to grace the cover of Mademoiselle magazine in 1976.

A decade later, Smith opened the first of her three restaurants located in New York, Washington DC and the village of Sag Harbor on Long Island. She has been a James Beard Award nominee and won the 2012 Silver Spoon award.

In 2001, Smith launched her first home decor collection for Bed Bath and Beyond, offering bedding, bath ensembles, rugs and paper products.

Her half-hour talk show B. Smith With Style currently airs on BET and Bounce TV networks, and she also hosts a show on SiriusXM radio.

Smith and her husband of 22 years, Dan Gasby, own a pair of apartments on Central Park South. The two are also business partners.

In June, Smith sat down for an interview with CBS News to talk about her battle with Alzheimer's - a severe form of dementia marked by the loss of memory and other abilities, which gets worse over time.

'Even with Alzheimer’s, I think that things are gonna work out,' Smith said at the time. 'I’m gonna do my best to make it work out for me, and for as many people that I can possibly help, too.'

Smith was diagnosed with the illness in October 2013 after more than four years of suffering from dementia symptoms.
