Migrants in Calais have clashed in a turf war as tensions in an illegal camp spilled over into violence.

Riot police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to contain the hundreds of East African men as they fought running battles early yesterday morning.

The rival groups from Sudan and Eritrea are battling for control of an area of land which is the best location for attempting to climb into lorries heading for Britain.

Turf war: A fight breaks out yesterday despite French police keep a close watch on migrants queuing for charity food handouts in Calais after days of violent clashes between Eritrean and Sudanese migrants

Fight: More than 50 migrants have been injured in overnight clashes in Calais after rival African groups started fighting at a food distribution centre. Above, a migrant is pictured pushing a waste bin over during the clashes

Brawling in the streets: The fight between Sudanese and Eritrean migrants broke out in the French port at around 7.30pm yesterday, and was initially halted by police, according to local government officials

One man was shot in the head and 51 others injured. It comes as a leaked police memo revealed French authorities are ‘alarmed’ by the soaring number of migrants arriving in the country.

Most have made their way from Italy after escaping East Africa.

An extraordinary 61,591 migrants landed in Italy in the first six months of this year compared with just 7,913 for the same period in 2013 and 4,301 in 2012.

The trouble in the camp – which has come to be known as Jungle 2 – has been rumbling on since Sunday night after groups of the young men clashed at a soup kitchen for supplies. Sunday’s incident left 13 injured. The following evening violence again erupted between the ethnic groups as they gathered at the food distribution centre and it continued into the early hours.

The man was shot in the head with what is understood to be an air rifle. He was airlifted to hospital but his wounds were not life-threatening. 

Wreaking havoc: But early today, riot officers were forced to intervene with tear gas and rubber bullets as the migrants continued to clash. Above, migrants run down the street during the brawl, which left 51 injured

Incident: The clashes started shortly after the migrants had been served rice and stew by a group of charities

Last night, dozens of police and aid workers stood guard at the outdoor soup kitchen. At one point, a fight broke out and migrants from both camps immediately picked up stones and prepared to join in. But the large police presence helped to calm matters and it died down.

The huge influx of migrants from Africa comes after the re-opening of the ports in Libya – a main jumping off point to Europe.

Migrants
 from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan who have been gathering there for two 
years can now leave – and an estimated 300,000 are said to be waiting to
 head across the Mediterranean for a new life.

The
 change of policy came after Libya said it would help them head to 
Europe if the EU did not give it financial help to cope with the influx.

From January to April this year, 42,000 migrants were recorded by EU border agency Frontex – 25,650 of them crossing from Libya.

Tensions have been at breaking point between the desperate men, who have crossed thousands of miles of desert and undertaken the perilous boat ride across the Mediterranean in their quest to reach Britain.

While previously, many have come from Afghanistan, the majority of this new migrant influx are from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan. The number of arrivals has spiked in recent months following the breakdown of borders in Libya after Colonel Muammmar Gadaffi’s fall in 2011.

Thousands of migrants have flooded through the newly porous borders to undertake the risky crossing to Italy offered by people traffickers. Many drown on the trip.

Once in Europe, most make their way to Calais and camp in the town until they manage to board a lorry undetected and get to Britain. Some have been trying for at least a year.

Estimates by French authorities suggest at least 35 are successful in crossing the Channel every day, but at least 1,200 migrants remain in the town. 

Fight: It is the third clash in 48 hours between migrants massing in Calais in a bid to cross the English Channel to Britain,.Above, migrants from east Africa queue for charity food handouts at a camp in the French port

Rapidly rising numbers of arrivals have raised tensions in the camps.

Yesterday, police divers dragged canals in the town, possibly searching for weapons, while police confiscated knives from young men heading to the nightly outdoor soup kitchen. 

Eviction deadlines on illegal migrant camps ran out on Sunday night and police prepared to move in, but following the outbreaks of violence officers delayed the evacuations and instead pledged to send in delegates to talk to the migrants.

Thomas, 30, from Eritrea, who said he has spent two months in Calais attempting to get to Britain, said Monday night’s fighting with the Sudanese was over territory.

He said: ‘They attacked us because they want to control the land next to the ferry.

‘They wanted to take it for themselves. This means they are the ones that can get to the lorries. They came at midnight and beat us up. They had knives and told us that no one else was allowed to enter the area. I was cut when I was hit in the face by a rock.’

One 17-year-old Eritrean boy looking to gain passage to Britain said that knives and stones were used in the attacks at the food distribution centre.

He said: ‘It was scary. It was between Eritreans and Sudanese. The Sudanese used knives and stones. They were hitting my sisters over the head.’

The teenager, who declined to be named, said he had not been in contact with his parents for the past three months as they remain in Africa.
