The U.S. federal government spent more than $5.3 million that it shouldn't have on food stamps and other nutrition assistance programs during the 2014 fiscal year, according to an inspection report published this month.

The spending, called 'improper payments' in government-speak, were totaled up through the end of August and accounted for 11 months of the fiscal year that concluded on September 30. The number is on pace to eclipse the total for 2013.

The government defines 'improper payments' as disbursements 'made to an ineligible recipient, a payment for an ineligible good or service, or a payment for goods or services not received.' 

Most shocking in the November 7 audit was that more than one-fourth of the money spent by the National School Breakfast Program met that definition.

Nearly all of the 'improper' payments consisted of overpayments. A tiny proportion were underpayments.

'But those get corrected,' said a congressional legislative assistant who covers agriculture for a midwestern Republican House member.

'There's virtually no case where food vendors or truckers or dairymen just say, "Okay, I'll accept less." Those cases get sorted out,' he told MailOnline on Tuesday.

'But almost none of the overpayments get refunded to the taxpayer, and that's maddening.'

The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that food stamps will likely always be a source of wasteful spending, and Congress is too afraid of voter backlash from low-income Americans to tackle the problem.

'They could triple the national debt on these programs and it would still be impossible to challenge them,' he said. 'It's the third-rail of politics. Touch it and you get zapped.'

Food-stamp benefit programs made $2.437 million in improper payments this year and serves more than 47 million Americans every month. 

Another $1.748 billion was misspent by the National School Lunch Program, amounting to more than one out of every seven dollars spent.

That program provides free or reduced-cost lunches to more than 30 million children during the school day.

But the National School Breakfast Program took the gold medal for wastefulness, with an 'improper' payment rate of more than 25.61 per cent.

That program spent $923 million it shouldn't have this year.

Another $206 million in misspent money was identified in the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program. The Child and Adult Care Food Program, a free snack and lunch service for day care centers, issued $10 million in improper payments.  

The Washington Free Beacon reported Tuesday that while the USDA's Food Nutrition Service oversees them all, it's also asking Congress to fund a substantial increase in salaried employees to keep them running.

The FNS employs 1,359 full-time permanent workers; the USDA wants that total hiked to 1,600 in the coming year.

Most of the increase, 333 new positions, would go to the food stamp system, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
