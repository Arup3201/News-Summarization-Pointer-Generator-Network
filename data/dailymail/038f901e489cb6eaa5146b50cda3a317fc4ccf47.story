It has recently undergone a multi-million pound overhaul with the help of English heritage, helping to restore the mansion to its stunning former glory.

The 18th century neo-classical villa includes four enormous reception rooms, a kitchen, breakfast room and study on the ground floor, with a spa, games, cinema room and gym areas on the lower ground.

There are ten main bedrooms and nine bathrooms, a large wing and a even a Stable House which provides secondary accommodation and boasts a swimming pool and spa.

Mr Bilton paid £2.5 million for the property in 2001 when it was being used as naturopathic clinic.He then spent millions restoring it with the help of architect Ben Krauze and under the guidance of English Heritage.

Sir John Soane was son of a bricklayer who rose to become professor of architecture at the Royal Academy.

He specialised in the Neo-Classical style of design and his architectural works are distinguished by their clean lines,  decisive detailing, careful proportions and skilful use of light.

The influence of his work, coming at the end of the Georgian era, was swamped by the revival styles of the 19th century. It was not until the late 19th century that his influence  was widely felt.

His best-known work was the Bank of England, a building which had a widespread effect on commercial architecture.

He also designed Dulwich Picture Gallery, which, with its top-lit galleries, was a major influence on the planning of subsequent art galleries and museums.

His main legacy is Sir John Soane's Museum, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London.

He received a knighthood in 1831, six years before his death at the age of 84.

In total Tyringham Hall has 25 bedrooms and 32 bathrooms, all of which deliver piping hot water on demand.

Crispin Holborow, head of Savills Country Department, believes Tyringham Hall is right up there with Britain's finest homes

He said: 'Tyringham Hall combines some of finest work of Soane and Lutyens, and as such could be labelled as one of England's greatest architectural masterpieces.What's more it is in exceptional condition having been beautifully restored."

Mr Holborow believes Tyringham Hall is likely to be snapped up by someone looking for a piece of English history.

He added: 'It is enormous but also remarkably compact. It has some wonderful formal rooms so can expand into a party home or contract into a family home.

'It is right at the top of English homes, an architectural jewel. It is architecturally and historically significant and this will attract buyers."

Tyringham Hall was designed by Soane in the late 18th century for William Praed, renowned banker and MP, and completed six years later.

It was was one of a series of new 
country houses designed by Soane, who is internationally regarded as one
of the greatest architects of the neo-classical period.

Soane, writing in his memoirs, described the period he was working on the house as some of "the most happy years of my life".

In
the 1920s, then owner Frederick Konig commissioned Sir Edwin Lutyens to
construct a substantial outdoor swimming pool which is now an 
ornamental pond.

He also created the bathing pavilion and the 'Temple of Music', which was modelled on Viceroy's Palace, in New Delhi.

Mr
Konig died in 1940 and, during World War II, Tyringham Hall became a 
maternity home before it was bought by the Australian and New Zealand 
Bank as a weekend club.

The estate also includes a Grade I-listed stable and carriage house which has also undergone an extensive restoration.

The stable house boasts seven bedroom, three reception rooms, and an indoor swimming pool with sauna and steam room.
