Real Madrid became the first club to score 1000 goals in European competition on Tuesday night with their 5-1 win over Basle. It was Karim Benzema  who got the 1000th goal, joining an illustrious list of some of the club’s most famous marksmen… and a Tottenham striker.

Roberto Soldado scored the club’s 800th goal in Europe from a David Beckham cross against Olympiacos in 2005, six years before Cristiano Ronaldo got goal number 900 in 2011 in a 2-0 win over Lyon.

Before Soldado, it was Raul who scored goal number 700 on his way to registering 71 Champions League goals – a total that has him as the competition’s all-time top scorer, three ahead of Ronaldo.

The Spanish striker endured a torrid first season at Tottenham, and has lost his place in the side

Fernando Hierro, who is now Carlo Ancelotti’s assistant, got goal number 600 in a 3-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen in 1998. Sebastian Losada got goal number 500 in 1990 in a 6-0 win over Odense.

Real were in the Uefa Cup in 1984 when they beat FC Wacker Innsbruck on their way to beating Videoton in the final and Santillana scored goal number 400 for them.

Ten years earlier one of Spain’s greatest ever midfielders Pirri scored goal number 300 in the Cup Winners Cup, and nine years before that the ‘Galloping Major’ Ferenc Puskas got the club's 200th European strike in a 5-1 over Odense.

Fittingly the man who marked up Real’s first century was the late, great Alfredo Di Stefano who scored against Barcelona in the European Cup in 1960.

Miguel Munoz has the honour of scoring Los Blancos' first ever European goal, when he put Real ahead in an away match at Swiss side Servette in October 1955. He then went on to manage the Spanish giants to nine La Liga titles.

It is Barcelona  who are closest to catching Real Madrid’s all-time haul in European competitions, with 980 goals, followed by Bayern Munich with 799 and Juventus with 736.
