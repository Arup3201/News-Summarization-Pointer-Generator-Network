Controversial comedian Russell Brand has landed in the middle of his latest controversy accusing the United States  of terrorism just hours after 132 Pakistani children were murdered by the Taliban. 

Brand was interviewing Moazzam Begg, a Briton who was detained at Guantanamo Bay when he wrote: 'The people who do "terror" best are the people who decide what "terror" is.'

The nine minute interview was posted on YouTube and said it would 'lift the lid' on Guantanamo Bay torture.

Comedian Russell Brand accused the United States of being terrorists in his latest outpouring on Twitter

Brand was interviewing former British Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, pictured, when he landed in his most recent controversy in the aftermath of the Taliban's massacre of 132 school children in Pakistan

Russell Brand created the latest Twitter storm after accusing the United States of terrorism in his Tweet

One Twitter user Colin Wright said: 'You do talk crap at times. Not all the time but I'm seeing it more and more.' 

Another user, Mark Lott claimed: 'I guess you haven't seen the news from Pakistan today yet.'

Nate Anderson added: 'Bad timing given what's just happened in Pakistan dude. Bad bad timing.' 

Brand was attacking the United States over their detention of Moazzam Begg, who was held after being arrested in Pakistan in 2002. He was brought to Guantanamo Bay and released without charge in 2005. 

He spoke to Mr Begg about his experiences at the hands of the US military and the CIA in Guantanamo Bay and Baghram Air Base in Afghanistan. 

Mr Begg said his interrogators asked him repeatedly about what was happening to his family when audio of a woman screaming was played in a different room. 

The former detainee said he was threatened with being sent to Egypt or Syria, where prisoners were regularly tortured. 

 In his interview, Mr Brand said: 'Language is so integral to our understanding of these issues. For or quite a while, I thought that waterboarding was just a hobby. They're just doing some waterboarding, oh that's nice, some time off between the torture.'

In a monologue at the end of his latest broadcast, Brand claimed: 'If we have a criminal government, none of us are free. If our freedom is contingent on total compliance, then none of us are free. If people are being tortured in our names or the names of the institutions that govern us, then none of us are free. It is ironic that the people that do terror best are the people who decide what terror is.' 

He had earlier become embroiled in the Sydney terrorist outrage, by claiming that Man Haron Monis was not a terrorist. 

Brand said: ''By us labelling him a terrorist rather than a dangerous mentally ill person - not that all mentally ill people are dangerous, I'm mentally ill - and by allowing him to set the agenda "I'm doing this on behalf of Islam" it gives a certain grandeur to nihilistic and violent actions but what's more interesting than the actions of a mentally ill person is the response of the political establishment,' he continued.

The comedian also blamed the media for fitting the story into their own frame, amid worldwide fears about Islamic State.

'It's convenient for people to enhance and increase fear around ISIL because currently there's an appetite to increase security measures domestically, to engage in foreign military activity in that region of the world for economic and corporate ends.'

Several Twitter users immediately attacked Brand's Tweet because of the ongoing situation in Pakistan

Brand criticised media reports that claimed gunman Man Haron Monis was a terrorist with links to ISIS

Monis kept 18 people captive for many hours until police stormed the cafe in the early hours of Tuesday

Brand dispersed Australian news reports and addresses from Mr Abbott in between his statements, and made the claim that terrorism is more a structure upheld by governments as a tool of power than anything else.

'Terrorism is continually used as a tool to control a domestic population. I'm not saying there aren't a lot of dangerous people out there, I'm saying a lot of those people are in government,' he said.

Australia's new terror and metadata laws were also up for discussion, with Brand saying giving authorities the immunity from prosecution is very dangerous, especially in light of recent information surrounding the CIA and torture claims.

Brand also claimed Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the government used the situation to fit their own framework

But he did acknowledge that 'we' need to pull together in times such as these 

He however ended his bulletin on a more positive note, saying the #illridewithyou hashtag was 'an offer of solidarity'.

'We have at this point got to pull together more than ever, when people control the media like Rupert Murdoch who says things like "Egyptians being white, all the Egyptians I know are white",

'Of course what's happened in Australia is sad and of course there's dangerous things going on in the world but our media uses that danger to suit their ends.

'It's really important in this time of division and fear that we embrace one another. Us, the normal people in the middle, embrace one another. Forget the extremists are either end of the social scale, whether they are motivated by religion or money or desire for power, and us, the ordinary people that want to make connections, have a right and a duty, in fact, to define the way we see reality,' Brand concluded.
