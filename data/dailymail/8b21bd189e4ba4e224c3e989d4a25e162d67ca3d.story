On the night the dark shadow of Luis Suarez fell over the Las Vegas strip, the lights were switched back on at full power by the genius of the greatest boxer on earth.

Floyd Mayweather was allegedly bitten on his left hand by Argentine wild man Marcos Maidana and not only the deed but the words were ugly reminders of serial chomper Suarez.

The scene had moved from the football pitch to the prize ring but the act seemed just as despicable.

After Mayweather protested he had been bitten in the eighth round, referee Kenny Bayless issued a severe lecture to the Maidana corner before allowing the fight to continue.

One he had finished delivering a masterclass to his challenger, Mayweather said: ‘At first I didn’t know what had happened but then I realised that he bit me. My fingers went numb and from the eighth round I could only really use the other hand.’

In true Suarez fashion, Maidana said: ‘No, no.’ And when showed the video clip of his crime he said: ‘Perhaps he put his glove in my mouth. Maybe he thinks I’m a dog.’

It was outrageous behaviour but it could not diminish the brilliance which gave Mayweather the 47th victory of his phenomenal, undefeated career.

Once again, a Floyd Mayweather fight ended with panic among the crowds leaving at the sold-out 16-000 seat arena.

The exit procedure seemed to be working better than when there was crushing at the first Maidana fight four months ago.

Suddenly, hundreds of fans came running back into the MGM Grand Garden Arena, several of them falling over the seats.

There was a report that someone had brandished a gun on the concourse and the fans were fleeing.

Several were wheeled away on stretchers but none of the injuries appeared serious.

And once he had corralled Argentina’s raging bull for a second time, he raised the prospect that the world might finally see him meet Manny Pacquiao in the $300 million mega-fight for which the world is still waiting, saying: ‘I will talk to my team to see what the future holds. 

But if the Pacquiao fight presents itself lets make it happen.’

Mayweather only gave himself ‘a C or a C-minus because I got caught with some shots I shouldn’t have.’ Modesty from this man, after giving a master-class in ring-craft. But then he is something of a contradiction.

Confronted by suggestions that his legs may be weakening, he danced and moved to drive Maidana to the distraction which no doubt led him to use his teeth rather than his fist. 

And while so doing he picked off his out-classed challenger with dazzling combinations and bursts of power which nearly landed the statement KO he craved.

Mayweather was on the floor twice but each time from shoves better suited to wrestling and on the second occasion referee  Bayless deducted a point from the Argentine.

Maidana could have been thrown out for the biting incident but Mayweather needed no help to pirouette and punch his way to victory.

He even found time to give a pointer to Maidana, which I have never previously witnessed in all these years reporting boxing.

Twice Maidana was so bewildered that he wandered towards the wrong corner at the end of two rounds. On the second occasion, Mayweather turned round to point his opponent in the right direction. 

Maidana was in denial on all fronts. He claimed he had won the fight saying: ‘If the judges want to give it to a fighter who ran, good luck to them.’

In truth those three official gave it to ‘still’ the best boxer in the world. Two of them by the same score as my card - 116-111.

Once again, Mayweather was bang on the Money.

1 - This is Mexico Independence weekend and the patriots from south of the border joined the Argentinians who had made the longer trip north in roaring Maidana into the ring.

Mayweather arrived to his customary mixed reaction from the lovers and haters. The atmosphere was intimidating, the boxers less so than at the start of their first fight. Mayweather slipped into elusive, dancing mood, rode a couple of swinging rights and pocketed the first round without undue exertion. 10-9 Mayweather.

2 - Mayweather  moving more than he did four months ago and Maidana  having trouble pinning him down. But when he did find his range he clipped the great man with a couple of good rights.That did not go unpunished but another flurry from the Argentinian probably stole the round. 10-9 Maidana.

3 - Maidana trapped Mayweather on the ropes early but few, if any, of his big swings were connecting. The champion changed up a gear and stopped Maidana in his tracks with several stinging rights. With referee Kenny Bayless keeping it as clean as possible there was more punching than brawling. Although Maidana landed a shuddering right as the bell rang it was Mayweather’s round – just. 10-9 Mayweather.

4 -  Encouraged by that success at the end of the third, Maidana launched a major assault. Mayweather was unable to dance away as he was pummeled on the ropes. Maidana ate some leather in the closing stages but the round was already his. 10-9 Maidana.

5 - With Maidana taking a breather after his exertions in the fourth, Mayweather got into his rhythm and began picking him off with a variety of accurate punches. The Hispanic contingent fell quieter as Maidana was rocked a couple of times in Mayweather’s best round so far. 10-9 Mayweather.

6 - The crowd had been sensing one of the ring’s major upsets earlier but there were cheers as Mayweather’s defensive genius made Maidana miss repeatedly. The old movement and counter-punching skills were back in evidence as Mayweather reeled his way a couple of rounds ahead on my card. 10-9 Mayweather.

7 - The away crowd tried to rouse Maidana but he seemed to be becoming mesmerised by Mayweather’s skills. For the first time Mayweather was on the front-foot, the aggressor. So bemused was Mayweather at being caught by laser beam punching that he wandered towards the wrong corner at the bell. 10-9 Mayweather.

8 - The pre-fight questions had been about Mayweather’s 37-year-old legs but it was Maidana who seemed to be flagging. Mr Money staggered him two or three times with classy combinations.

Controversy raged with Mayweather apparently complaining he had been bitten on his left hand. Bayless issued stern warnings to the Maidana corner and the jeers for the Argentine would have sounded familiar in the ears of Luis Suarez. Afrer all that, it was Maywearher’s round by a distance. 10-9 Mayweather.

9 - Mayweaher continued to proves as elusive on the retreat and as wounding with his left right combinations. When Maidana lost his way again at the end of the round it was his tormentor who turned to direct him to his corner. 10-9 Mayweather.

10 - Mayweather returned from that unique piece of behaviour at the end of the ninth to dictating the direction of the fight. In his frustration Maidana wrestled Mayweather to the canvas and had a point deducted for his troublesome conduct. With Maidana rallying thereafter we had a round scored at 9-9.

11 - Maidana was granted recovery time for an alleged low blow but it looked a marginal offence by Mayweather, whose body punching was taking as much out of his challenger as the stinging attention to the head. Maidana was treading deep water throughout the round and almost sank in the closing seconds as Mayweather caught him with punishing lefts and rights. 10-9 Mayweather.

12 -  As if to mock those who had suggested his legs were slowing, Mayweather danced through the last in Ali fashion. That provoked some boos but Maidana needed a knock out and this became even less likely as he hit thin air. 10-9 Maidana.
