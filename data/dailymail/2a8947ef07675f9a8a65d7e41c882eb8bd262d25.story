A fortnight ago, Ayoze Perez was best known for a YouTube clip which showed him weaving between four Carlisle defenders and scoring in front of a handful of onlookers at Newcastle United’s training ground.

His brother, Samuel, was arguably getting more attention turning out for Blyth Spartans in the Northern League.

Not anymore. For the past week has seen the 21-year-old graduate from internet viral to the big screen.

First, there was the winning goal at Spurs on his full Premier League debut. Then, alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, he picked up a pair of awards at a glitzy ceremony in Spain. And to cap it off, it was he who came from the bench to nick Newcastle’s winner against Liverpool on Saturday.

‘It feels incredible,’ said the £1.5million former Tenerife forward, who scored 16 times in Spain’s second tier last season.

‘I couldn’t ask for any more. It is a dream come true for me. To make the jump from a team like Tenerife to playing in the Premier League is incredible really. It is something that I always wanted to do.

‘It’s been a really good week with the two goals, but more importantly because it’s the fourth consecutive win for the team. It has been a really good time for the club.’

And what of those awards? Best breakthrough player and best attacking midfielder in Segunda Division.

‘It was a very important night for me and it was very emotional to go back to Spain and win the awards,’ he said.

‘It was amazing to be surrounded by so many world class players and it means a lot to me. I think it is the reward for all the hard work I have put in to the start of my career when I was in Spain.’

Ayoze Perez’s strike for Newcastle United in the 1-0 win over Liverpool ensured this game’s ability to keep producing goals continues. These clubs have not shared a 0-0 draw since February 1974. 

It is all a far cry from behind-closed-doors practice matches against League Two opposition. Perez scored four in an 8-0 win that afternoon and his new team-mates are said to be quite taken with the Under-21 international, who had offers from Barcelona and Real Madrid before joining the Magpies in June.

The intention, however, was to stagger his introduction to the senior set-up. Rather, his impact has been staggering.

‘There was a lot of interest in me from some very important teams, but I always knew that Newcastle would be the right move and the last few results have just proved that,’ he said.

‘I know I made the right decision and I am very happy here.’

He added: ‘I definitely feel ahead of schedule. I always hoped I could do well but things have been very good and I am feeling great here. I feel like I’m settling in well and I just can’t wait to play more games now because I feel like when I play I can score more goals.’

His headed winner at Spurs was followed by a predatory stab against Liverpool, seizing upon a mistake by compatriot Alberto Moreno to pierce Simon Mignolet’s target.

And manager Alan Pardew feels Perez is a natural in the penalty box.

‘He has a knack,’ said the United boss, whose own position is now safe on the back of four straight wins. ‘He has a lot to learn about the English Premier League but you know that if something falls for him he will score. You sometimes get a player who can do it in training but not on matchday, but he has shown he can do that and has had a fabulous week.’

From YouTube to Match of the Day, the rookie striker is certainly passing his Premier League screen test.
