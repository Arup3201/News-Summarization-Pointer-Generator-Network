A former airline pilot murdered his estranged wife by deliberately crashing his car into a tree at more than 50mph after the passenger airbag had been disabled, a court heard yesterday.

Iain Lawrence purposely careered off a bend on a quiet country road in order to kill his 47-year-old wife in a ‘most cunning way’, it was claimed.

Despite being ‘fanatical’ about wearing a seatbelt, Sally Lawrence was not strapped in, jurors were told yesterday. Her husband, however, was wearing his seatbelt.

'Cunning': A court sketch shows Iain Lawrence in the dock at Leicester Crown Court where he stands accused of murdering his wife Sally, right, by deliberately crashing his car into a tree as she rode in the passenger seat

Mrs Lawrence, the managing director of
a business that specialised in cleaning up chemical spills, was said to
have been terrified of her husband in the months before her death, even
telling one friend: ‘One day he will kill me.’

Leicester Crown Court heard that she would never have got into his car unless forced or tricked.

Prosecutor Nirmal Shant QC said 
Lawrence, who ran a car trailer business, had been unable to accept that
his wife wanted a divorce and had started a new relationship.

He killed her, the barrister said, ‘out of greed, anger and possibly jealousy’.

Miss Shant told the jury: ‘The car was
driven into a tree and the deceased died almost instantaneously because
the airbag didn’t detonate – and the reason the airbag didn’t detonate 
was because it had been switched off.

‘The question for you is, “Who 
switched the airbag off?” His airbag was on, hers off. He was wearing 
his seatbelt, she wasn’t. Him in the brace position, her dead.

'She was fearful he might do something
to her, and that is exactly what he did, in the most cunning way, in a 
plan that was not likely, he thought, to raise suspicion.’

The couple had a ten-year-old son, who was away on a school trip at the time of  the crash.

Mrs Lawrence, who also had two adult daughters from a previous marriage, suffered no injuries consistent with wearing a belt.

The Crown claims she was either not 
wearing one, or did not have it clipped in. Miss Shant told jurors: ‘If 
she wasn’t wearing a seatbelt, you have to ask yourself who unclipped 
it.’

She said accident investigators found 
no evidence that Lawrence, 53, had attempted an emergency stop, and that
the passenger side of his Peugeot 406 received the ‘brunt’ of the 
collision.

He escaped the crash with minor 
injuries – and bruising consistent with being in the ‘brace’ position at
the time he crashed into the tree at an estimated 52.3mph.

A police officer who examined the 
scene concluded that the vehicle had partly negotiated a bend and then 
taken a ‘different and deliberate’ course that led to the tree.

Miss Shant said it was a mystery what 
Mrs Lawrence was doing in her husband’s car. She had her own Jaguar and 
would ‘never willingly’ travel in his vehicle.

When police examined the Jaguar, which
was at the estranged couple’s home in Oadby, near Leicester, last 
October, they found it contained Mrs Lawrence’s purse, phone, laptop and
overnight bag. She had been planning to spend the night with her new 
partner, Martin Smith, the court heard.

Mrs Lawrence suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash near their home village.

The prosecutor added that Lawrence 
claimed to have no recollection of the crash but a number of witnesses 
at the scene believed he was ‘faking’ unconsciousness.

Miss Shant said ‘matters had been 
brought to a head’ a day before the crash when Mrs Lawrence had an 
‘acrimonious’ discussion with her husband about the division of assets, 
particularly the £300,000 home they still shared despite living 
‘separate lives’.

In text messages to one of her 
daughters that night, she said the conversation had gone badly because 
Lawrence wanted ‘more than half’ of  the house, and that she planned to 
lock herself in her bedroom because she was so scared of him.

Miss Shant said Lawrence had previously told his wife in a ‘menacing’ way: ‘You’ll get your feelings back for me.’

She also told a work colleague her husband ‘had evil in his eyes’ when they spoke, and that she feared being alone with him.

The couple had married in 2000, but the marriage ran into difficulties and Mrs Lawrence began divorce proceedings last year.

The decree absolute was issued the month following her death. Lawrence denies murder. The trial continues.
