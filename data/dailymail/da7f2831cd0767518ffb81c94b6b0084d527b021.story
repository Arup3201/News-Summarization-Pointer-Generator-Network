Under the new syllabus, students would be expected to study how controversial comedian Russell Brand, pictured, used language in different contexts

Teenagers could study the language of Russell Brand and Dizzee Rascal under controversial plans for a new English A-level.

The proposals, by the OCR board, provoked a storm at the Department for Education, while one campaign group calls them ‘dumbed down’.

Under the new syllabus, students would be expected to study how Brand, a former heroin addict, used language in different contexts, such as when he gave evidence to MPs on drugs policy.

Senior sources said examiners must be ‘having a laugh’ if they believed the A-level would be allowed into schools.

Exams watchdog Ofqual will make a final decision on whether the syllabus should be accredited for use in sixth-forms across the country.

OCR said the new qualification - a combined A-level in English language and literature - aimed to expose teenagers to a broad range of styles and genres.

Examiners insisted that classics of English literature such as Shakespeare, William Blake, George Orwell and Charlotte Bronte would also feature strongly.

But elements of the course were condemned as ‘dumbing down’ yesterday.

Candidates will be expected to study how comedian Brand - a former heroin addict - used language as he gave evidence to MPs about drugs policy.

During his appearance before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, he said drug addiction should not be seen as a crime but a disease and called for Britain to ‘look into’ decriminalisation.

He also joked with MPs, who asked him if he had been arrested ‘roughly’ 12 times for possession of drugs. Brand replied: ‘Yes, it was rough’.

The syllabus also features an interview with Dizzee Rascal on BBC2’s Newsnight, when Jeremy Paxman referred to the rapper as ‘Mr Rascal’.

OCR said candidates would be asked to comment on ‘mode, purpose and audience’.

Further 
texts to be studied include the Twitter feed of author and blogger 
Caitlin Moran, the musings of the Secret Footballer and speeches by 
artist Grayson Perry.

Teenagers will also tackle the memoir which inspired the Oscar-winning film Twelve Years a Slave.

OCR hopes the qualification will be introduced in schools in September next year.

It was developed after Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered a radical overhaul of all GCSEs and A-levels to restore public faith in exam standards and put an end to grade inflation.

But the proposed new course - one of many due to presented for accreditation over the coming months - is unlikely to be considered rigorous enough to be accepted.

A senior DfE source said: ‘This is exactly the kind of dumbing down we are trying to get rid of.‘They must be having a laugh if they think A-levels in Dizzee Rascal and Russell Brand are going to be let through.’

Extracts from interviews with Brand and the rapper feature in an anthology which pupils will be required to study in detail and answer questions on to achieve 16 per cent of their A-level marks.

There will be opportunities in class to assess Brand’s language in different contexts.

Further musings by Brand could feature as part of ‘unseen’ texts that pupils will be questioned on as part of a written paper.

OCR insisted the anthology had been deliberately conceived as a historical sweep from the 17th century to the present day.

Hester Glass, OCR subject specialist for English, said: ‘By creating a new model with a linguistic approach to literary texts, we aim to set a new gold standard to transform the A-level into a more valuable, distinctive qualification.

‘It will provide a firm grounding for university and improve employability in any field that requires an ability to use language in a practical, agile and articulate way - from science, business or politics to the arts.’

The course has been developed in conjunction with the English and Media Centre, which provides training for English teachers.

Barbara Bleiman, co-director of the English and Media Centre, which provides training for English teachers, said the course would ‘excite and inspire teachers with the power of the English language’.

‘The new A-level will introduce new approaches and scope for more creative writing, while offering teachers and students the flexibility to explore an extremely broad variety of styles, methodologies and genres,’ she said.

The bar needs to be raised above Russell Brand’s head

But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the course smacked of an attempt to appeal to youngsters with ‘fashionable’ and ‘trendy’ themes.

‘It looks as if boards are continuing with their policy of making subjects relevant and accessible but our experience of what this means in practice is dumbing down,’ he said.

‘The bar needs to be raised above Russell Brand’s head.

‘There are plenty of contemporary texts that could be seriously studied.

‘When pupils in China, Singapore and other high-performing countries sit down to study English they won’t be turning to Russell Brand, rappers and Tweets.’

A DfE spokesman said: ‘All new A levels must be accredited by the independent exams regulator Ofqual against new, more rigorous criteria. This exam has not been accredited and we await Ofqual’s decision with interest.’
