There are some debts which can never fully be repaid: the freedom which Britain and her people owe the mighty little Spitfire is one of them.

When Britain stood alone against the threat of Nazi Germany, the Spitfires and ‘the Few’ who flew them protected our skies and all that lay beneath.

Even today, almost three-quarters of a century after the Battle of Britain, the air-rending thunder of a 1750-horsepower Merlin engine and the sight of those curved wings slicing through the clouds can still lay claim to the heart of the nation.

Boultbee Flight Academy in West Sussex can offer passenger flights to non pilots in their £2 million Spitfire TR9 aircraft built in 1944

And now, remarkably, ordinary members of the public can experience the thrill of flying along Beachy Head in this unique aircraft. This is because back in September, the historic rules limiting Spitfire experiences to those who hold a pilot licence were lifted by the Civil Aviation Authority.

Boultbee Flight Academy in West Sussex is the only company approved by the Civil Aviation Authority to offer passenger flights in their Spitfire TR9 aircraft, which was originally designed to train fighter pilots. Yesterday I was lucky enough to soar out over the white cliffs of Southern England, the Channel limpid below and the late afternoon light torching into an orange parabola around the wooden propeller.

It was an extraordinary experience; the closest any of my generation will come to knowing what the Few knew, that this is flying at its most graceful and elemental. We arced and turned and dived and climbed into the setting sun, the smell of hot grease and engine fuel wafting into the cockpit, the thrumming and throbbing of the plane’s tiny carcass beating into our backs.

And as we did so we felt the decades rapidly slip away – for the Spitfire is an icon of aviation, the years have not withered her magnificent power nor her silvery allure. At 280mph – using a mere fifth of the engine’s capacity – and 500ft above the waves, we carved our own little bit of history along the fortress of white cliffs which would once have welcomed Britain’s fliers home.

I was flying in Gilda, a Mark IX Spitfire built in 1944 which is worth £2 million – and is one of just seven two-seater Spitfires in the world.

The flight in a Spitfire, pictured, could just about be the best Christmas present any Briton might receive for next year

I climbed in behind pilot Matt Jones into a rear cockpit where space is so tight it’s measured in fractions of an inch and there is no floor above the constantly moving controls.

As the chocks are pulled away, the flaps lifted for take-off and the canopy closes over your head, it’s almost like the Spitfire claims you.

That much was expected, but what came as a surprise was the gentleness of one of the most brilliant war machines ever built; so soft are the controls that the merest movement of the stick up or down or from port to starboard will send it skimming into another corner of sky.

After flying over the Channel, we turned inland, reaching 2,500ft as a pale autumn mist rose beneath us. Then we crossed the Thames up into East Anglia towards the Imperial War Museum at Duxford where Gilda is to spend the winter. Shortly before we landed, Matt pulled back the worn leather casing of the joystick, glanced at me in the cockpit mirror and gently pulled the nose up while turning the plane a full 360 degrees: a victory roll.

As we turned, pulling 2.5 times the force of gravity (Gs), I watched the world spin on its very axis and waited for my stomach to catch up.

A few minutes later we accelerated to 300mph and performed a Half Cuban, a partial loop from which you also emerge in a roll, pulling 3.5Gs, the swiftness and sharpness of the Spitfire’s manoeuvrability giving some small clue to her prowess in battle.

Now you can win your own flight in a Spitfire, which could just about be the best Christmas present any Briton might receive for next year – the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.

The little plane, which saved so very many lives, gave me the ride of mine.
