David Cameron today paid further tribute to teenage cancer victim Stephen Sutton who raised £4m for charity before he died.

The Prime Minister described the 19-year-old as an 'absolutely inspiring individual' whose 'zest for life - even as he was suffering from a very difficult and progressive cancer - was completely extraordinary and very inspiring'.

His speech during Prime Minister's Questions today came after Stephen was honoured with an MBE in this year’s Queen’s Birthday Honours.

The teenager, whose trademark thumbs-up 
gesture summed up his refusal to be brought down by the disease, 
captured hearts around the world and raised an astonishing £4million for
 the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Despite always saying he did not want recognition for his charity work, Stephen formally accepted the tribute before losing his fight with the illness a month ago – and declared the honour ‘awesome’.

Speaking about the rare posthumous MBE, Mr Cameron said today: 'He raised a huge amount of money for teenage cancer services and raised it from right around the world as well as the UK.

'I think it’s right that our honours system does properly reward people that give to charity - that give their time - from the very bottom to the very top.'

He added: 'I think there’s probably more we can do to make sure that our honours system really reflects what the British public want which is to see giving, generosity and compassion rewarded.'

Mr Sutton’s MBE is backdated to the date of his death on May 14.

At the time, upon learning the news, Mr Cameron tweeted: 'I'm deeply saddened to hear that Stephen Sutton has died. His spirit, bravery and fundraising for cancer research were all an inspiration.'

He had visited Stephen at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham two weeks before he died.

Speaking to visitors and patients at the hospital, he said: '[Stephen] is an amazing guy, amazing guy.

'He’s actually been to Downing Street.

'Sadly I wasn’t there the day he came - one of the things on his bucket list was to make a speech there.

'When you watch that YouTube video, it is one of the most amazing things you will ever see.'
