The Liberal Democrats have stopped the Government from ‘really delivering’ on immigration reform, David Cameron claimed today.

The Prime Minister said he needed a Tory majority after the next election because he had not been able to ‘go ahead with all the things we wanted to do’.

Mr Cameron’s remarks come after he pledged to make reform of European freedom of movement rules the centrepiece of his Brussels renegotiation if he wins the next election.

The PM claimed he had already restricted the benefits migrants could claim – but admitted further reform would be ‘tough’.

Speaking to Radio Kent this morning, ahead of the crunch November 20 Rochester and Strood by-election, Mr Cameron said: ‘I believe at the next election I’ve got a very strong case to say you’ve seen what we’ve done in Coalition, having to make some compromises, not being able to go ahead with all the things we wanted to do – now give us the chance to really deliver for the country, including on issues like immigration.’

Mr Cameron said freedom of movement within the EU was not ‘an unqualified right’.

He said: ‘You can’t come here and immediately claim benefits. We’ve said that if you come here and claim benefits, that after six months you should go home. We’ve said that if you come here and you can’t support yourself and you’re begging on the streets you should return to the country you came from.’

Mr Cameron added: ‘We’ve already made qualifications, but my view is that there is a lot more we can do to make sure that we properly control immigration into our country, both from outside the European Union, where we’ve cut migration quite substantially under this government, but we also need to take steps with Europe as well.

‘As far as I’m concerned the British public are the boss, they’ve made it very clear they want this issue sorted out, and that’s exactly what I want to do.’

Angela Merkel has allegedly vetoed a proposal to cap the number of migrants allowed Britain every year

The Prime Minister insisted the German Chancellor Angela Merkel shared some of his concerns about immigration – amid claims she had vetoed plans to put a cap on the number of migrants allowed into Britain each year.

He said: ‘I’ve had good conversations with Angela Merkel about this, and she’s talked about the issues they’ve had in Germany with the problems of migration and particularly this issue of people being able to claim benefits.

‘So look, of course we’re not all instantly going to agree, and of course this will be a tough negotiation, but the point I’d make is look, you’ve got one leader, David Cameron, the Conservative party…who have a very clear view that we need to have a renegotiation and then a referendum on Europe.

‘We have a plan to bring our immigration under control, and I don’t hear that plan either from Labour or the Liberal Democrats or indeed Ukip. Because of course if you vote Ukip you probably end up with a Labour government and no immigration control at all.'

Mr Cameron said he wanted to change Britain's relationship with Europe. 

He said: 'I don’t want a referendum today because I’m not satisfied with the way Europe is working today.

‘But I believe that if you put forward a strong case for renegotiation, hold that renegotiation, get a better deal, we can address issues like immigration.

‘In the end, it’s not going to be my decision whether Britain stays or leaves the European Union.

‘I’m a positive person, I want to put a positive approach to this which is to get the changes we need, but in the end it will be for the people of Britain, the people of Rochester and Strood to decide to stay in on these new terms or leave.’

He dismissed a suggestion that the Tories should make an election pact with Ukip to shore up support in marginal consituencies.

‘I don’t believe in deals and pacts. The next election is absolutely wide open, and it could easily result, if people vote the right way, in a Conservative-only government.

‘That’s what I’m campaigning for and nothing’s going to distract me between now and then.

‘People know with me that I will always try and do the right thing for Britain.’
