David Cameron today said he was 'proud' to have backed same sex marriage

David Cameron today sought to heal deep divisions in the Tory party, insisting opponents of his policy to legalise gay marriage are not 'wrong-headed or bigoted'.

But the Prime Minister said he was 'proud' to have backed same-sex weddings, revealing his hope that young boys at school today who think they might be gay and are being bullied will 'stand a bit taller' as a result of equality laws.

In an attempt to quell the mutiny in Conservative ranks he promised there would be no more controversial social policies like gay marriage, and warned Tory rebels he will not be bulldozed into changing his policy on Europe.

Plans to legalise gay marriage cleared the Commons last night, despite efforts by Tory backbenchers to derail the legislation.

There was applause in the House after MPs voted by 366 to 161, a majority of 205, to give the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill a third reading.

But the policy was opposed by 136 Tory MPs, amid warnings local party associations are haemorrhaging support as opponents of the move tear up their membership cards.

Mr Cameron admitted gay marriage has been deeply unpopular within Tory ranks, but insisted it was the right thing to do.

In a passionate a deeply personal defence of same sex weddings, Mr Cameron said: 'I think marriage is a wonderful institution, it helps people to commit to each other. I think it’s such a good institution it should be available to gay people as well as heterosexuals.

'There will be young boys in schools 
today, who are gay, who are worried about being bullied, who are worried
 about what society thinks of them, who can see that the highest 
Parliament in the land has said that their love is the same as everyone 
else’s love, and that we believe in equality. 

'I think they’ll stand that bit taller today, and I’m proud of the fact that has happened.'

Mr Cameron is in Brussels today for talks on tax avoidance, where he spoke to European Parliament President Martin Schulz, right, Croatia's Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, second left, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte

David
 Cameron tried to draw a line under the deeply damaging row over claims a
 senior Tory figure dismissed Tory activists as 'mad, swivel-eyed 
loons'.

Conservative co-chairman Lord Feldman, a close friend of the Premier, has denied making the remark to two journalists.

Mr Cameron said: 'It is not what I think, it is not what the people around me think.

'I
 think sometimes the media have a view that there is a complete 
disconnect between the politicians who stand for election and the 
volunteers who support us.

I
 think that is completely wrong. I think of the volunteers in my own 
constituency, they are not just my friends and my supporters, I feel I 
am one of them.

He said the Tory party was a 'broad 
church' of opinion but being in government meant taking tough choices. 
'When you make decisions sometimes you make opponents and enemies.'

'Of course the gay marriage issue has been divisive and I totally respect those who take a different opinion.

'I
 don’t think in any way that to oppose gay marriage to be wrong-headed 
or bigoted. This is a different point of view but we should respect each
 other,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

But he sought to reassure the party grassroots that he will not go to war with them again.

'Is
 this the first of many issues like that? No it isn’t.

'The government is
 going to be absolutely focused on the big picture which is fixing our economy, reforming welfare, making sure there are good schools for our children to go to.

'It is all about making sure Britain can win in this global race, and we’ll do that by backing the aspirations of people in this country, by being on the side of people who want to work had and do the right thing.

'I think, frankly, for the next two years that is going to be the absolute focus that I have, that the Conservative party has, that the Government has.'

Mr Cameron said the party had managed to have a disagreement on Europe 'about an issue we actually agree about' over the last few weeks.

Before traveling to the EU summit, Mr Cameron insisted he will not be pressured into changing his Europe policy

Mr Cameron issued a blunt warning to Tory Eurosceptics that he will not be bullied into changing his policy on the EU.

There are growing fears in Downing 
Street that more than 100 Tory rebels now believe they are able to exert
 influence over Mr Cameron, particularly on Europe.

In
 January he promised to renegotiate terms with Brussels, before staging 
an in-out referendum by 2017.But 114 Tory MPs backed an unprecedented 
vote against the Queen's Speech for not promising a  referendum sooner.

Some want him to defy the Lib Dems in the coalition and legislate for a referendum before the 2015 election.

Mr Cameron was forced to interrupt a 
visit to the United States to rush out a draft bill legislating to stage
 an in-out vote in an attempt to placate his critics who want a tougher 
line on Europe.

In a sign of concern that he is being
 buffeted by Eurosceptics, in the way that John Major's government 
unraveled in the 1990s, Mr Cameron was forced to state publicly that he 
would not be pressured into changing his Europe policy.

'Let
 me say, this policy, it doesn’t matter the pressure I come under from 
outside the Conservative party, or in Europe, or inside the Conservative
 party, this policy isn’t going to change,' the PM said.

'The
 question isn’t going to change. The number of referenda isn’t going to 
change. The date we hold this referendum isn’t going to change.

'This policy isn’t going to change, no matter what pressure I come under from within the Tory party.'

Critics,
 including former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson, who claim his plan to 
renegotiate Britain's EU membership is doomed to fail are 'just wrong' 
he added.

Mr Cameron claimed there was 'incredible unity and agreement' in the Tory party and the wider country on Europe.

And
 he boasted that he had the 'boldest, clearest, most straightforward 
policy on Europe that any party leader has had for 30 or 40 years'.

'The
 Conservative party managed to have a disagreement over the last couple 
of weeks about an issue that we actually agree about – that there should
 be a renegotiation, there should be a referendum.

'Now
 all we need to do is focus on the substance of the policy, and the 
substance of the policy – a renegotiation, a referendum – is backed by 
the overwhelming majority of the British people, because it’s the right 
thing to do.'

After weeks of turmoil both Mr Cameron and deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today vowed that the coalition would last until 2015

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg 
today used a highly-combative speech to warn the warring Conservative 
Party it must ‘get back to governing’.

He
 said Tory infighting over Europe and gay marriage has been an 
‘unwelcome distraction’ which is undermining public support for the 
Government.

Key Queen’s 
Speech announcements on issues such as pensions and long-term care for 
the elderly, have been obscured by internal ‘political punch ups’ in the
 Tory Party, Mr Clegg claimed.

Mr
 Clegg added: ‘Anyone watching would be forgiven for asking: what are 
these politicians doing? So it’s time to get back to governing – 
providing the leadership and focus the people of Britain deserve in 
these difficult times.’

Mr Cameron hinted in a recent interview that he could continue to govern even if the Lib Dems left the coalition.

But today he insisted he would continue to hold power with Mr Clegg up to the day of the election.

'That is absolutely my intention and has always been. This is a Government that has an enormous programme of work,' he said.

'Here
 we are in year three of this Government and here we are doing a massive
 reform of the state pension system to provide a generous single-tier 
pension for everyone on retirement.

'Here's
 a government that is cracking a problem that has eluded government for 
years of making sure people don't have to sell their home to pay for 
care.

'These are big bold 
reforms. To anyone who doubts the life there is left in the coalition, I
 would argue there is more to come. Very bold reforming and strong 
government, and that is what we will be right up till polling day.'
