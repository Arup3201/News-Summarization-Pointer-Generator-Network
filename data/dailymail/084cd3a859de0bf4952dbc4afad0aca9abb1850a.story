A 92-year-old war veteran who shot dead an intruder at his home had been targeted by robbers three times in just 12 days in August, police have revealed.

Sheriffs were so fearful of further activity around Earl Jones' home in Boone County, Kentucky they installed surveillance cameras to capture any other robberies at the property.

Footage from the motion-activated video cameras captured the most recent break in that led to the death of Lloyd Maxwell after Jones coolly shot him dead from his living room chair with a .22 rifle.

Frustration: Earl Jones, 92, shot dead a home intruder after his house had been robbed three times in a month

'The video quality is subpar but definitely shows activity in the house,' sheriff's spokesman Tom Scheben said.

The dark video reveals the first intruder crawling through a dog door in the basement before letting in his two accomplices.

Scheben added that the cameras had been installed on August 30 after Jones' home, where he has lived since 1955, had been hit three times between August 14 and August 25.

Burglars took a 
television, a several thousand dollars and a personal cheque from his 
house. In April, thieves also stole 90 of Mr Jones' 
cows from a field behind his property.

In the latest incident, Jones was awoken by noises in his home at around 2.10 a.m. and fetched his rifle before settling in his favourite armchair and taking aim at the living room door.

Jones said he fired a single shot after the 
intruder climbed up stairs and kicked in the door.

'He kicked it hard and dang near knocked
it off the hinges,' Jones told Cincinnati.com. 'When the body appeared, that’s when I 
raised the rifle, and I fired one shot.'

He went on: 'I’m a military man – I ain’t going to 
dial somebody and have to wait for an hour while the guy shoots me in 
the face and is gone. Time is of the 
(essence). You only got so much.'

Maxwell's accomplices Ryan Dalton, 22, and Donnie Inabnit, 20, then fled, dragging the dead man with them. Jones said he was only sorry that two others who took part in the raid escaped unharmed.

'I was hoping another one would come up – I aimed right for his heart,' he said.

Jones also showed little emotion over killing 24-year-old Maxwell.

'It was simple,' he told the Enquirer. 'That man was going to take my life. He was hunting me. I was protecting myself.'

Police do not expect to charge Jones 
with a crime as Kentucky as the state has a 'stand your ground law' that
allows householders to use deadly force if they are in fear of their 
lives.

Jones is adamant that he was within his right to shoot the intruder at the home.

'I didn’t go to war for nothing. I 
have the right to carry a gun. That’s what I told the police this 
morning,' according to the Enquirer newspaper.

Dalton and Inabnit were arrested 
after they called police to report their friend had been shot and 
admitted they had been involved in the home invasion.

Scene: Jones was awoken just after 2 a.m. on Monday by a loud bang and reached for his gun

The two men, both from Dry 
Ridge, have been charged with second degree burglary and tampering with 
evidence.

Nationally 
the killing of criminals by individuals trying to defend their property 
has increased in recent years, from 196 in 2005 to 278 in 2010, 
according to FBI Uniform Crime Report statistics.

Jones’ home is not the only one that has been targeted in the area recently, neighbours said.

Annette Moore, who also lives on Violet Road, said thieves took a 
computer and TV from her home earlier this year.

Last Friday - two days before the break in at Jones' home - intruders stole another computer and some of Moore’s 
jewelry while she was out running errands.

'I feel bad Mr. Jones had killed someone, but if he wounded him, I would have been cheering,' Moore told Cincinatti.com.
