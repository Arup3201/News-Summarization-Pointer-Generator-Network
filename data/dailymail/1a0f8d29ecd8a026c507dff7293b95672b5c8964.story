Paris Saint-Germain lost 4-2 against Bastia in Ligue 1 but the result pales by comparison to the events in the French capital this week.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his PSG team-mates wore black armbands and held a minute's silence prior to kick-off as football showed its support following the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre. 

Elsewhere Swansea City's Bafetimbi Gomis celebrated their Barclays Premier League goal with a French flag, Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho donned a black armband and Roma manager Rudi Garcia gave every journalist a pencil at his press conference 'as a symbol of freedom'.

It all looked straight forward for PSG after 20 minutes, having taken a 2-0 lead through Lucas Moura and Adrien Rabiot.

But their defensive liabilities were yet again exposed by a side fighting relegation from Ligue 1, leaving PSG without a win in three games.

Bastia answered with four goals, starting with Ryad Boudebouz's penalty after 32 minutes.

That was soon followed by Francois Modesto's equaliser on the stroke of half time to make it 2-2.

After the break, it was the Julian Palmieri show.

The French attacking midfielder proved the difference, scoring in the 56th and 89th minute to secure the 4-2 win.

It means PSG manager Laurent Blanc squandered the opportunity to close the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Marseille.

Before the winter break, Blanc lamented his team's lack of aggression and rigor, particularly when defending set pieces - and two of Bastia's goals  came from corners. 

The pressure is firmly on Blanc now to return to winning ways against Saint-Etienne on Tuesday, when PSG face them in the French league cup quarter-final.
