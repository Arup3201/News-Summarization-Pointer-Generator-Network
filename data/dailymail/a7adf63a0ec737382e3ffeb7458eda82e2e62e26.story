One of the world's top modeling agencies has turned to Instagram in order to scout for new talent. 

As part of its worldwide We Love Your Genes model search, IMG Models, which looks after the likes of Kate Moss, Karlie Kloss and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is calling on any eager future fashion stars to upload their best selfies to Instagram, using the hashtag #WLYG.

But, determined not to judge the girls on just the one image, the agency's VP of scouting, Jeni Rose, explained to Fashionista that they want each person to create more of a digital portfolio, by posting a series of images which showcase their 'whole personality'.

Future fashion star: Isabell Klem from Hawaii was one of the first models to be scouted by IMG via her Instagram account. As soon as they spotted her beautiful pictures, they flew her out to New York to meet with them

Be yourself: Model Sofia Rivolta, who was recently signed to IMG after they noticed her potential via Instagram, advised other budding fashion stars to avoid using too many filters in their own selfies 

'Instagram allows us to see potential models' natural beauty in their everyday lives,' she said.

'They no longer have to spend lots of money on photo shoots or portfolios. Instead, they can come directly to us with simple smartphone snapshots and a lot of enthusiasm.'

While the agency will not yet reveal whether it has successfully signed any of the would-be Instagram models to its books, the official We Love Your Genes Instagram account says that it has already scouted 'dozens' of girls via social media. 

Ms Rose also admitted that IMG has received more than 14,000 submissions from young women who are eager to join its books.

Lookalike: After being scouted on Instagram, model Gabi Konopko was quickly catapulted to stardom, with many commented on her similarities with fellow IMG model Lara Stone

It is hoped that the idea of a social media model search might one day become a widely-accepted means of finding new talent - not least because it saves the agencies from having to send their scouts abroad in order to meet with potential models.

'We've been scouting via social for a while now and have developed proprietary methods to help us identify the best possible talent,' Ms Rose added.

'Those methods are now informing special tools we're building in-house that will help us move quickly and decisively while tracking thousands of accounts.' 

The We Love Your Genes Instagram account, which is run by Ms Rose and her colleagues, has now amassed nearly 12,000 followers - however thus far only a hand full of carefully-selected Instagram submissions have been chosen to feature on the account.

Going global: Thus far IMG have received more than 14,000 submissions from around the world, including London, Sweden, Spain and America

New IMG model Luna Sobrino is quoted on the account, which details her reaction to being scouted: 'I couldn't believe it! Literally not until I spoke to Jeni Rose on the phone I realized that I was given such amazing opportunity!” 

IMG are certainly not the first to turn to social media as a means of finding models - although this campaign is believed to be one of the biggest ever run. 

Both Marc Jacobs and Guess have held casting calls on Instagram in the past, with Marc Jacobs opting to use the social media platform in order to choose girls for both its Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 campaigns.  

'It seemed like a great idea to me, as casting through Instagram seemed cool, current and strong,' Jacobs told WWD after his fall campaign was unveiled.

'We wanted the ads to shout with youth and energy...to be fresh and reclaim the spirit that the collection had when we first conceived of it - to be another collection, not a second line.'
