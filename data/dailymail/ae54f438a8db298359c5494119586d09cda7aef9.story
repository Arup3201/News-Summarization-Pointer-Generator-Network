Living in a wealthy country doesn’t necessarily mean you will be happier, according to a study.

Researchers found that once a nation’s gross domestic product surpasses £22,200 per person, individual happiness begins to nosedive – as the worry of ‘keeping up with the Joneses’ kicks in.

The researchers said these high expectations in the world’s wealthiest countries were to blame for creating dissatisfaction among citizens.

The British study compared per capita GDP with data on life satisfaction gathered from the World Values Survey.

Wealth doesn't pay: Once a country's GDP per person tops £22,200 per person, the level of the nation's individual happiness starts to drop

In the poorest countries happiness rises as a country’s wealth increases and citizens are able to afford their basic needs.

People in countries with a GDP per capita of below £4,100 were 12 per cent less likely to report the highest level of life satisfaction than those in countries where it reached £11,100.

However, beyond a level of £12,600 per person, the link between increasing prosperity and happiness is much less marked.

Between this level and the very highest GDP per capita level £33,000, the probability of reporting the top level of life satisfaction changes by no more than two per cent.

Satisfaction peaked at £22,200, after which it appeared to dip in the world’s richest nations.

It means Britons, with a per capita GDP of around £22,800, should be fairly satisfied with their lives.

Lead researcher Dr Eugenio Proto, of Warwick University, said: ‘Whether wealth can buy a country’s happiness is a major question for governments. Many policy-makers, including in the UK, are interested in official measures of national well-being.

'Our new analysis has one very surprising finding which has not been reported before – that life satisfaction appears to dip beyond a certain level of wealth. 

‘In our study we see evidence that this is down to changes in the aspiration levels of people living in the richest countries.

‘As countries get richer, higher levels of GDP lead to higher aspiration. There is a sense of keeping up with the Joneses as people see wealth and opportunity all around them and aspire to having more.

‘But this aspiration gap – the difference between actual income and the income we would like – eats away at life-satisfaction levels.

‘In other words, what we aspire to becomes a moving target and one which moves away faster in the richest countries, causing the dip in happiness we see in our analysis.’

The findings, published in journal Public Library of Science ONE, seem to confirm the Easterlin Paradox – that the link between life satisfaction and GDP is more or less flat in richer countries.

But the study seemed to go further in suggesting a small drop in life satisfaction once countries go beyond a certain level of prosperity.

Based on the findings, residents of wealthier nations such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway should be less content than their UK counterparts because of the higher GDP per person.

But a separate UN study published earlier this year found all three countries rank in the top five most satisfied nations, while Britain was ranked in 22nd place.
