A gun store that featured a picture of comedy superstar Will Ferrell alongside a controversial assault rifle has been ordered to take down the advert by Hollywood executives, it has been reported.

Family Firearms, in Valrico, Florida, featured an image from the hit 2003 Christmas film, which made more than $220million worldwide, on a flyer for a 'Build-n-AR' event in December, where customers are taught to build and then take home an AR-15 rifle for $895.

But the company which produced Elf was not happy and sent the gun store a cease-and-desist order, reports TMZ.

Now the store has replaced the  Ferrell picture with a generic picture of an elf on their website.

Neither Family Firearms nor the production company were available for comment.

Ferrell was one of a number of celebrities to star in a video released by Demand a Plan, urging viewers to help end gun violence in the wake of a spate of massacres in the U.S.

The AR-15 was the gun used by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who killed 20 first grade children and six women at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012.

It was also the firearm used by James Holmes when he killed 12 cinemagoers at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises last July in Aurora, Colorado.

A proposal by President Barack Obama to stop civilians being able to buy rifles such as the AR-15 fell apart even before reaching Congress.

An estimated five million AR-15s are now in civilian hands.
