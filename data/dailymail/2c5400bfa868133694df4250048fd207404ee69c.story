Law and order: 140 offences were reported to police from the Parliamentary estate, including three sexual assaults, common assault and harassment

Police have investigated three cases of sexual assault on women working in Parliament, according to newly released data.

They are among some 140 offences reported to police that took place on the Parliamentary estate - which includes the House of Commons and the House of Lords - between March 2012 and last December.  

Three cases of common assault and three of harassment were reported from the House of Commons - and another harassment complaint at the Palace of Westminster. 

There were also 23 cases of malicious communications - a more than threefold increase from just seven in 2011, which included a complaint from former MP Louise Mensch, who was sent emails which threatened her children.

Internet 'troll' Frank Zimmerman, 60, was given a 26-week sentence suspended for two years and banned from contacting Mrs Mensch and a string of other public figures. 

At Cromwell Green, the visitors' entrance to Parliament, police and security guards seized cannabis, knives, CS gas and other weapons.  

The latest figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act to the Daily Mirror, also reveal the theft of £10,200 worth of laptops, iPads and iPhones.

Also reported stolen were 70 mugs taken on one single occasion, chocolate and a teddy bear.  

A spokesman for the House of Commons told the Mirror: 'Security is adequate and reviewed.'
