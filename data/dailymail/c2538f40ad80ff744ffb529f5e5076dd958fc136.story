These pictures show villagers in Borneo cooking an eating an orang-utan after it was shot in the jungle.

The villagers claim they found the endangered 
animal after it had been shot by hunters, who mistook it for for a deer.

They said they could not save the 
dying great ape - believed to have been at least 20-years-old.

Disturbing: A man shows some of the orang-utan's body parts - which was allegedly shot by hunters

One of the men who ate the endangered animal, Hanafi, 58, described the meat as delicious.

He said: 'Hot meat like venison, tough, but tasty, tastier than beef and pork.

Ignasius Mandor, 50, who also ate the orang-utan, said it was better to eat than leave it to die in the forest.

Having eaten the meat, he dried the skull on the roof of his house.

Other villagers were said to have been shocked by the news.

Remains: Two men show some of the endangered animal's body parts

Three men were arrested by the Indonesian Natural Resource Conservation Agency on Thursday. 

The head of the Indonesian Natural Resource Conservation Agency BKSDA, Siti Chadidjah Kaniawati, said an investigation found 
nothing to indicate the orang-utan died from a gunshot wound.

The images come at the start of Orang-utan Awareness Week, organised by the Orang-utan Foundation.

The foundation's director Ashley Leiman said: 'The plight of the orang-utan is very serious.

Arrest: Three men have now been arrested by the Indonesian Natural Resource Conservation Agency

Endangered: The ape, which can only be found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra, is endangered due to deforestation and poaching

'More than 80 per cent of their habitat has been lost over the past 20 years.'

Environment
Minister Lord de Mauley will launch the orang-utan season of the If 
They're Gone campaign - which raises awareness for the plight of 
numerous endangered animals - tomorrow.

Lord de Mauley said: 'Everyone can make a difference by buying products made with sustainable palm oil.'

At risk: The Orang-utan's habitat is rapidly being destroyed to make way for palm oil plantations

The great ape's habitat in Borneo has shrunk dramatically due to deforestation to make way for palm oil plantations.

The orangutans are the two 
exclusively Asian species of extant great apes. They can currently only 
be found in only the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra.

Both orangutan species are considered to
be endangered due to aggressive poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade.

It has been reported today that British soldiers will help fight Somali Al Shabaab terrorists thought to be slaughtering endangered animals to fund their war on the West.

According to the Sunday Express, troops from 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment will help wildlife rangers in Kenya in a bid to stop the 'blood ivory' trade.

The Al Qaeda-linked group is funding its terrorist activities selling rhino horns on the black market and is thought to earn the group £400,000 a month.
