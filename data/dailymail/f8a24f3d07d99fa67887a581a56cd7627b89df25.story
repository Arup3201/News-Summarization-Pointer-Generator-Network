Prosecutors in Utah will not seek criminal charges against the woman whose 11-month-daughter died after being left in her car in 90-degree heat for hours.

Washington County Attorney Brock Belnap said going after April Suwyn for the Aug. 1 death of little Skyah 'is not in the interest of justice,' KSTU reported.

'Because the purpose of the criminal 
justice system is to penalize a conscious wrongdoer, justice will not be
 served prosecuting April Suwyn, because she was not blameworthy of 
mind,' Belnap wrote, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

'The evidence shows that April was a loving,
 thoughtful caregiver who was operating under lack of sleep, changed 
routine, and stress.'

Tragic loss: April Suwyn, 32, left her 11-month-old daughter Skyah in a hot parked car for hours on Aug. 1

Baby Skyah
 was just one week short of her first birthday when Suwyn broke her 
normal routine and brought her beloved daughter along in the car to drop
 off her two young sons with a babysitter.

But
 the urgent need to use the restroom meant April parked her car and 
rushed back into her home, leaving Skyah behind in the hot parked car.

It was only when she went back to the car around 1pm that she noticed her grave mistake.

Paramedics life-flighted Skyah in extremely critical condition to Dixie Regional Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

Neither 
April nor her husband Micah have made statements regarding their only 
daughter's death, but Suwyn's sister Aimee Wright said the tragedy was an accident.

Prosecutors agreed.

'Rather than abandoning Skyah, [Suwyn] acted under the erroneous belief that Skyah was napping safely in her bedroom crib,' Belnap wrote.

The prosecutor added, 'an unconscious lapse of awareness is substantially different than a conscious decision to leave a baby in a car.'

April Wright says that Skyah's death was the result of a change of routine for her sister, who usually has a neighbor look after her daughter while she takes the boys to a babysitter.

But she decided to take Skyah along for the ride that day.

There was construction going on in the neighborhood so Mrs Suwyn had to park a few blocks away from her home, where she does nails in her in-house salon while watching Skyah.

Mrs Suwyn rushed out of the car after parking, since she needed to use the restroom, and went about her day under the impression she took Skyah out of the car and put her down for nap as usual.

She found her daughter hours later when she went back to the car to pick up her sons.
