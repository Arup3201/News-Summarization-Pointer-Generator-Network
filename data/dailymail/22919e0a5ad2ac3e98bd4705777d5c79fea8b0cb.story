Internet provider TalkTalk is to become the latest to block pornographic websites by default in an attempt to protect children.

Any customer who has so far ignored online prompts from the company will find adult material automatically filtered under a scheme being rolled out next month.

The move follows Sky’s decision to install a family-friendly filter unless households specifically ask for it to be turned off. Pressure was last night building on BT and Virgin Media to introduce similar safeguards to reduce the risk of children accessing hardcore images or videos.

Child safety experts said there was no excuse for the two companies, who between them have almost 15million customers, not to follow suit.

The latest move is another victory for the Daily Mail which has campaigned for an automatic block on online porn.

David Cameron has called on all internet companies to do more to protect children from the ‘devastating’ impact of accessing pornography.

New customers signing up to TalkTalk have its HomeSafe filter turned on by default. The group has also contacted the majority of its 4million broadband customers requiring them to choose whether to activate the filter – with the ‘on’ setting pre-selected.

But parents who have not visited the TalkTalk website will not have received the prompt, meaning it is possible their children could still see inappropriate material on the internet. Next month the company will roll out technology that targets customers who have not already opted to prohibit or allow adult content.

Anyone attempting to access a pornographic website will be told it is blocked, and required to log in with an adult’s details in order to turn off the filter.

TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding said: ‘Our HomeSafe technology is free for all our customers and lets them filter out categories of inappropriate content such as pornography, violence and gambling.’

All TalkTalk customers will be asked every 12 months to re-affirm their decision to allow or block adult websites. Child safety campaigners welcomed the move and called on BT and Virgin to implement similar measures. Simon Bass, chief executive of the Churches’ Child Protection Advisory Service, said: ‘There can be no excuse now.’

A BT spokesman said that by the end of this month it will have contacted all its existing customers requiring them to choose if they want to turn on its free parental controls.

A Virgin Media spokesman said: ‘Our customers are able to use the free tools and expert advice we offer but it is for individuals to choose what is right for them.’
