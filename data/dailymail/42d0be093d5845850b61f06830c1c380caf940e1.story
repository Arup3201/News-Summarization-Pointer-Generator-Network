Sheila Eddy, 17, prepares to plead not guilty to stabbing her one-time best friend as she appears in Monongalia County Court in Morgantown, West Virginia, on Tuesday

A West Virginia teen accused of stabbing her best friend to death has pleaded not guilty to first degree murder in court.

Seventeen-year-old Shelia Eddy also denied conspiracy and kidnapping charges when she appeared in Monongalia County court on Tuesday.

Prosecutors say Eddy plotted the murder with Rachel Shoaf, then the two girl lured Skylar Neese out of her house in 2012 and stabbed her to death.

The body was stashed under some branches in the woods across the Pennsylvania border. A potential motive has yet to be revealed.

Tuesday's trial was the first time the victim's family had seen Eddy.

Judge Russell M. Clawges, Jr. set a trial date of October 22.

Eddy's name first became public this month, when prosecutors transferred her case from juvenile to adult court.

Shoaf, meanwhile, has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is awaiting sentencing.

Investigators found Earl-Neese's Neese's 
body six months after the horrific slaying, but only after Shoaf 
confessed to the brutal murder.

The slain girl's father had hoped previously that Eddy would plead guilty, thus avoiding a revealing trial.

What went wrong?: The three girls were said to be inseparable friends before Neese was stabbed to death because the two teens allegedly no longer liked her

'I don't want to hear the grisly 
details of how Skylar was murdered,' Dave Neese said. 'I don't want to 
hear how she screamed and cried. But I do want these girls to get what 
they deserve.'

Proceedings will be held in open court going forward, prosecutors announced this week.

Cold blooded? Shelia Eddy, 16, pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and will be tried as an adult

Prosecutors have said they will recommend Shoaf receive a 20-year sentence, but the confessed killer faces as much as 40 years behind bars.

Court documents offer no insight into the motive for the crime.

WDTV reported that Dave Neese stated: 'They didn't like her anymore. That's the only response I got.

'I want a reason, I want some kind of reason (for this to) happen. There is no reason I don't care if you have the best reason in the world, but there's no reason (for this to happen).'

Neese added of Rachel Shoaf: 'I feel bad for your parents and I hope you rot in hell.'

The victim was last seen on surveillance video leaving her family's apartment voluntarily and getting into a car on July 6, 2012.

She was initially considered a runaway, but her parents soon suspected she was abducted.

Police chased numerous leads with no luck. The break finally came when Shoaf admitted plotting with another girl to kill her â€“ shocking even the investigators working the case.

'They look as normal as any other kid that you could ever see,' said barber BJ McClead. 'Not kids you would think would have anything to do with anything like this.'

It's unclear how long the three girls had been friends or just how close they were.

Surveillance
video showed her getting into a car at the end of her street in a quiet
residential neighborhood near West Virginia University.

With no sign of fear, no money and no contact lenses, she apparently expected to return.

Skylar Neese disappeared in July 2012 and was 
initially thought to be a runaway but her parents soon suspected she had
been abducted

Shoaf's family issued a public apology through a lawyer but has made no further statements.

'There is no way to describe the pain that we, too, are feeling,' they said.

'We
are truly sorry for the pain that she has caused the Neese family, and 
we know her actions are unforgivable and inexcusable.

'Our daughter has admitted her involvement and she has accepted responsibility for her actions.

'Our hearts are broken for your loss,' they told the Neese family, 'and we are still trying to come to terms with this event.'

Mary
Neese has declined interview requests. But the family has tried to 
spare others their agony, persuading legislators to pass 'Skylar's Law' 
earlier this year.

Shock: In Star City, West Virginia, the community was shaken. Barber BJ McClead (pictured) said of the accused: 'They look as normal as any other kid that you could ever see.'

Mystery: People in the small West Virginia town had wondered for months about Skylar Neese. She vanished after slipping out the bedroom of her Star City home in July 2012
