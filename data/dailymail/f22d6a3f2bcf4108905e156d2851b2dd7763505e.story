A former guest-house owner has been given a new lease of life after taking part in a rare three way kidney swap.

Jacinta Ormerod, 58, received a new kidney after her husband donated his to a stranger.

The kidney for Jacinta's transplant came using a kidney from an unknown male donor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. In return, her husband Bryn, 60, donated one of his kidneys to be used for another transplant.

Relief: Jacinta hopes her new kidney will last 20 years. She organ donation was made possible after her husband Bryn signed onto the National Pairing Scheme

Two other couples involved in the scheme also each gave a kidney - and received one in return.

The unusual procedure meant three patients received a desperately-needed organ. It is part of the National Pairing Scheme brought in in 2010 to try to ease a shortage of donors.

None of the donors were a match for their own partner but were able to help someone else by 'pairing up' with a stranger.

Jacinta, from Higher Moorgate Farm, near Rochdale, Lancashire, said having a healthy kidney was like winning the lottery.

She said: 'I now have a man's kidney, a large kidney which they had to put in upside down and literally jam in to get it working.

'Three friends and Bryn had joined the national donor scheme in the hope I could get a match but it was Bryn who came out as the one who could be involved in the three-way transplant.'

Jacinta, who has also battled skin cancer for 17 years, described the operation as one of 'military precision'.

She said: 'I was in the operating theatre when my kidney was on its way. Bryn was at hospital too having a kidney removed for someone else.

'Now it has been done, it's fantastic. It's remarkable how different I feel. The elation when it was actually working and I found out Bryn was okay, was incredible. He gave someone else his kidney so someone could help me. It was better than winning the lottery.'

Jacinta was treated at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. The couple have written to thank the anonymous donor

Jacinta, who was born with Spina Bifida, had a previous kidney swap, but it failed. Bryn then joined the National Pairing Scheme in a bid to find a matching kidney donor.

Jacinta, who met Bryn when she was 15, said: 'The fact is, six people are happier. I just feel lucky every day. I'd like to thank the staff and surgeons at Manchester Royal Infirmary for making it all possible.

'I just hope this kidney stays for the next 20 years.'

Both Bryn - a director of residential homes - and Jacinta want to raise awareness of the donor register and the National Pairing Scheme.

They have written to the anonymous donor couple thanking them for 'giving us our lives back'.

Bryn said: 'We don't know who they are, they don't know who we are, but maybe we can see them one day.

'The pairing scheme is incredible. It's so important to be on the transplant list. You can make an unbelievable difference to someone's life.'

Afshin Tavakoli, Renal Transplant Consultant at the MRI, said: 'Jacinta's case was very complex and it was thanks to the hard work of the whole team that it was successful.

'As one of the busiest transplant units in the country, we carry out a lot of complex transplants and the pooled donor programme allows us to help patients who may have otherwise still been on the transplant waiting list.

'Our team continue to work hard for the success of the transplant programme and that is always helped when we are able to see patients doing so well after transplant.

'We are really pleased to see Jacinta's positive progress and wish her all the best for the future.'
