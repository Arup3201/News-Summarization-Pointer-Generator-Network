They have been described again and again today as 'just another set of excited grandparents'.

But it is clear to anyone who saw Carole Middleton and the Duchess of Cornwall arrive at the Lindo Wing at St Mary's this afternoon that Carole and Camilla are no ordinary grannies.

They are the ultra groomed, ultra glamorous grannies of the future King.

The two arrived separately to visit the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son, Carole arriving at 3pm with her husband Michael, and Camilla at around 5.30pm with Charles.

And both looked the picture of elegance.

Fittingly, Carole chose a
pale blue printed dress by Irish designer Orla Kiely - a label worn 
frequently by both of her daughters - to meet the grandson she will have
such a hand in raising.

The dress, which was belted neatly at Carole's slender waist, was from the 2012 collection and would have cost around £160.

For
her part, the ever more glamorous Camilla, who was once lambasted for 
her dowdy style but is now so often the picture of elegance, wore a 
pretty white silk dress with frilled neckline.

While the third in line to the throne is the first grandchild for Carole, for Camilla it is her sixth.

The two sets of grandparents arrived this afternoon just moments before the Duke and Duchess were to leave the hospital for their journey back to Kensington Palace.

The new parents are set to spend two weeks at the Palace while William enjoys his two weeks of paternity leave.

Then, it is thought that Kate will travel to Bucklebury to the mansion Carole and Michael bought earlier this year where she will spend the next four weeks under the wing of the Middleton before the couple are likely to join the Queen in Balmoral where she will be for the summer.

Glamorous: Camilla was once criticised for her dowdy style, but in the years since her marriage to Prince Charles has blossomed into a truly elegant consort

Both grandmothers understand the leg-lengthening value of a pair of nude heels. And while Carole paired the dress with
nude mid-heel courts from Russell & Bromley Chic Pump mid-heel court, £175, Camilla wore a pair of cream and taupe courts.

In an indication of the key role the Middletons will play in the upbringing of the heir to the throne, they today became the very first members of the family to meet the Duke and Duchess's new 
son, almost 23 hours after the infant was born.

Until then the new parents had spent time bonding together with their baby. 

Carole declared her grandson, her first grandchild, to be 'beautiful' after the hour and a quarter-long visit. They are both doing really well,' she said. 'We are so thrilled.’

Carole added that the new parents were doing ‘fabulously’ - but wouldn't be drawn over the issue of naming the baby. No suggestions from them then? ‘Absolutely not!’ said Carole.

Carole and Michael arrived a short while after Kate's hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, unofficially confirmed that the Duke and Duchess would be departing today by arriving at the back entrance of the Lindo Wing wheeling along her kit bag.

The Middletons paused only for the 
briefest of moments at the top of the steps at the front entrance of the
Lindo Wing before disappearing inside, no doubt eager to meet the new 
arrival.

The boy, who 
is third in line to the throne, will be the first monarch of the 22nd 
century, and will succeed his father William, making him third in the 
line of Kings that will follow on from the Queen's lengthy reign.

Kate,
William and the new baby are expected to make their own appearance on 
the steps of the Lindo Wing, just like Charles and Diana did before 
them, at around 6pm today.

A member of the Royal household 
arrived at the same time as the hairstylist, carrying an opaque dress 
bag that looked to be holding at least three garments, thought to be the
selection of dresses Kate will choose from to make her first appearance
as a mother.

Speculation raged over what the Duchess might wear - but the odds were on her choosing a blue dress by a British designer.

exception. She chose the mid-heel court Chic Pump for today's 
appearance

It was one of the first clues that the Duke and Duchess would be leaving the hospital with their little prince today: Kate's hair stylist arriving at the Lindo Wing.

Accompanied by her assistant - who was carrying a baby car seat and a dress bag - the royal hairstylist, who also does the hair of Prince William and Prince Harry - arrived at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington shortly before Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton.

Amanda Cook Tucker, 50, often styles Kate's hair at home and has been cutting William and Harry's hair for years.

Amanda Cook Tucker has been Kate's hairdresser since the couple visited the Far East on a Diamond Jubilee Visit in September last year.

The blonde stylist was credited with giving Kate heat-proof hair that defied the humid Asian weather.

Previously Kate was a long-term client of the Richard Ward celebrity salon in Chelsea.

A source told the Mail on Sunday's Katie Nicholl last year: 'Amanda is an expert at what Kate loves – full glossy blow dries that hold.'

Mrs Cook Tucker’s ex-husband Neville Tucker also has Royal connections.

His Knightsbridge salon held the Royal Warrant from 1980 to 1994 and he worked closely with the Queen’s longest-serving hairdresser, Charles Martyn.

The Prince of Wales paid the cost of Mrs Cook Tucker throughout the tour last autumn, believed to be £300 a day plus travel costs.

A spokesman for the Duchess at the time said: ‘The Duchess’s hairdresser on the tour is a private individual paid for privately.'

A far cry from the throne he will one day occupy, the seat retails online for as little as £80
