Forget the norovirus, there is a new pandemic striking the nation: Facebook Fashion Fear.

The popular social media network is causing fear and unrest amongst young girls, with many feeling compelled to invest in a new outfit for every Saturday night out for fear of being snapped wearing an item of clothing they have already been tagged in.

A staggering 72 per cent of women admitted they only wear a party dress once, with over a third confessing they would cancel a night out if they didn't had something brand new to wear.

Facebook Fashion Fear is hitting the nation as girls become increasingly concerned by how their are perceived online

Social media platforms, including Instagram, which has recently taken over Twitter with daily mobile users reaching more than 7.8 million, have played a massive part in women's insecurities and fashion worries.

This pressure has caused a surge in the British female population placing the number of social media ‘likes’ they generate after posting a photo of themselves in an outfit as being more important then a compliment from their partner.

In fact, 40 per cent revealed ‘likes’ are the number one influencer on their mood and determines if they have a good Saturday night or not.

Females polled from Liverpool say the Facebook Fashion Fear (FFF) sets in from Monday lunchtime with 62 per cent revealing they order their next Saturday night outfit by Tuesday at the latest.

Leeds girls are slightly more relaxed with the majority saying they are happy to wait until Thursday before worrying about clothes for the weekend ahead.

The ladies from Liverpool, where Coleen Rooney hails from, are the most conscious while the Bristolians like Sophie Anderton are the most laid back

Bristol customers were the most laid back with 81 per cent of Saturday night orders made the day before for next day delivery.

AX Paris, who carried out the research, found that customers in Scotland and London say they would wear the same outfit more than once and avoid the FFF by mixing up accessories, with the maximum wear being three times for a party dress.

Monica Mistry, marketing manager for AX Paris, said: 'A high proportion of our customers are girls looking for the perfect Saturday night outfit, who want to look fashion forward and fresh in the photos that are shared across the many social media platforms.

'Everything we do nowadays is documented online and in the same way celebrities we admire wouldn't be papped in the same outfit twice, it seems neither would our customers.

'We were also interested in the buying behavior of our customers regionally and the report does confirm certain stereotypes, such as Liverpool ladies taking an exceptional level of care and planning their Saturday night look as early as the Monday before.'
