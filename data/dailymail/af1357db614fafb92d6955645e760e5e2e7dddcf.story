A man born with no arms of legs has fulfilled his dream of being a pro fisherman and now competes in one of the world’s top tours.

Clay Dyer, 36, has caught more than 7,000 fish weighing up to 44lb during the Bassmaster Open Series, a bass fishing tour across America.

Grasping the rod between his neck and shoulder to cast, he then uses his partial right arm to operate the reel, snapping the rod with his neck and shoulder to haul the fish into the boat.

Clay Dyer, 36, competes in fishing tours around America despite being born without arms or legs

Clay holds the rod between his neck and shoulder to cast, controls the reel with his partial right arm, and snaps the rod with his shoulder to flick the fish into his boat

He even refuses to use a specially adapted rod because he believes they give him an unfair advantage over the other competitors.

The unique method has never hindered his chances of bagging a prize catch, winning up to £5,650 ($9,500) in competitions.The largest fish he ever caught was a 44lb mackerel.

Clay, from Fayetteville in Tennessee, USA, caught his first fish when he was eight.

Clay refuses to use a specially adapted rod, because he believes it would give him an unfair advantage

Clay started fishing with his family and caught his first fish aged eight. The largest he has ever landed was a mackerel weighing 44lb

He said: 'I’ve been competitive my whole life - I was a three-sport athlete in school.

'I played baseball, American football and basketball. I used my right shoulder and right jaw to hold/swing the bat in baseball.

'I used my right arm and right side of my face to aim and throw and hold the basketball and football.

'But I chose fishing because it gave me the best opportunity to get to the top.

'There are modified rods and reels I could use but I’ve never looked into them. Other anglers don’t use anything special - I want it to be an even playing field.'

Growing up Clay was surrounded by fishing-mad family who would take him with them.

His unorthodox technique has never stopped Clay from landing a winning catch, and he has previously scooped $9,500 (£5,650) in prize money

Clay says he tried different kinds of fishing before settling on bass fishing because it is the most lucrative

He added: 'My family was always fishing - I caught my first fish in my grandparents pond.

'I loved all kinds of fishing from catfishing to browns but bass fishing is a lot more lucrative so that’s why I chose it.

'The competitive fishing circuit is like a great big family. We all compete but at the end of the day we all respect each other.'

Over the course of his career, Clay has landed more than 7,000 fish in disciplines including catfishing
