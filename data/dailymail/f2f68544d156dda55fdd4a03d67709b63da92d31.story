Former President Bill Clinton admonished the NFL on Wednesday for the way it 'diminished' domestic violence early on in the Ray Rice scandal and expressed skepticism over the former football star's claim that his abusive behavior toward his wife was a 'one-time incident.'

'God I hope that it works out alright for . . . I hope he really is OK, and he never does it again,' he said of Rice. 'Sometimes people don't, but it's rare.

'It will either happen again or it won't,' he later stated.

Clinton discussed the sensitive issue while in conversation with CNN host Erin Burnett at his non-profit's annual meeting in New York.

The 68-year-old philanthropist spoke about his own experience with domestic violence as a child and pushed for the National Football League to take violence against women seriously.

In an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett today at the Clinton Global Initiative today, Bill Clinton said the NFL should decide the consequences for domestic violence 'based on the facts' and 'how serious it was'

Clinton seemed skeptical that Ray Rice was a reformed abuser. 'Sometimes people don't' ever hit their partners again, Clinton said, 'but it's rare.'

'No incident should be ignored,' Clinton said, 'because if you do that, it just gets progressively worse.

'Based on my experience, I think it's a mistake to ignore it,' he said.

Clinton wouldn't say whether her thought there should be a zero tolerance policy for domestic violence in the NFL, but he did say 'there should be consequences for domestic abuse and every case they know about.'

'What the consequences should be should be determined by the facts,' he said, 'and of course how serious it was.'

Clinton, who signed the Violence Against Women Act into law 20 years ago this month, has been open about his stepfather's abuse of his mother throughout his younger years. The former president credits a confrontation with his stepfather at age 14 for the cessation of the disturbances.

'I just broke down the door of their room one night when they were having an encounter and told him that I was bigger than him now, and there would never be any more of this while I was there,' Clinton told journalist Joe Klein, then of New York magazine, in a January 1992 interview.

During his dialogue with Burnett at the Clinton Global Initiative gathering, Clinton drew on his intimate knowledge of spousal abuse while talking about Rice and domestic violence in general.

Clinton said that 'anybody who's ever been in a domestic situation knows' that abuse 'happens all the time.' The incident with Rice and his then- fiancee and now wife, is just one of many instances of spousal abuse taking place in America, he said.

'And look, I'm not minimizing what happened on the elevator, I'm just telling you that anybody who's ever been in one of these situations has seen it over and over and over again,' Clinton added.

'So I think we need to try to figure out how to make something good happen out all of this,' Clinton said.

The former Arkansas governor said society needs to realize that 'in real life there are people, good people, who lose their self control' and hit their spouses.

Victims of abuse know that they should probably leave their partners 'because they can't help it, they're gonna do it over and over again,' Clinton said.

'But they could be helped,' he interjected. And that's why 'we need to offer early intervention' and the violence prevention hotline 'needs to be answered all the time.'

'We should be trying to help people get beyond this, and then if they can't, there should be consequences,' Clinton said, referring to the abusers.

Speaking indirectly about Rice, Clinton said 'people who are rich and popular because of athletics or entertainment, or any other like that, they shouldn't be held to an impossible standard.'

'But they shouldn't be exempted from the general rule that we can't get away with abusing people because of [our] positions,' he noted.

Furthermore, Clinton said that society shouldn't write off every football player in the NFL as a criminal because of the abusive behavior of their current and former teammates. 

Many of them are 'good husbands and good fathers,' he said.

'I think it's really important that people not judge the whole league based on this, and that we wait to see what happens in this case,' he said.

Clinton also claimed in the interview that the concussions that football players receive on the field may lead to more domestic disputes.

Researchers have warned in the wake of the Rice affair that no conclusive evidence exists to support that theory, however.
