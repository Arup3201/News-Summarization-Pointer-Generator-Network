The 'conservative' family of two young sisters arrested in Cambodia for taking naked photos inside the Angkor Wat temple has told Daily Mail Online: 'They didn't mean any disrespect.'

Lindsey Adams, 22, and her 20-year-old sister Leslie, from Prescott, Arizona, were discovered apparently having dropped their trousers inside the temple complex.

They have been deported to Thailand, fined $250 each and banned from entering Cambodia for the next four years.

Cambodian officials have now confirmed earlier reports the sisters were being deported, saying 'the court decided to expel them from Cambodia' following their confessions.

Arrested: Lindsey Adams, 22, (pictured in an earlier holiday photo) and her sister Leslie, 20, were detained for taking naked pictures at Cambodia's sacred Angkor temple

Questions: Lindsay (left) and Leslie (right) from Prescott, Arizona, looked sullen as they spoke to police

Happier times: The sisters pulled funny faces and smiled in one of their more modest tourist snaps

Local police said the women 'lowered their pants to their knees and took pictures of their buttocks.' 

A world heritage site, Angkor contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries, and is Cambodia's most popular tourist destination. 

Chau Sun Kerya, a spokeswoman for the Apsara Authority, said the women's actions were offensive because Angkor is considered sacred ground.

According to Cambodia Expats Online the pair were charged with trafficking pornography and exposing their sexual organs.

Awaiting further action: Officials are debating what action to take and what charges to level against the girls

Admitted their mistake: The girls apologized to officials and said they realized it was wrong, police said

Scene of the incident: They were taking nude photos inside the Preah Khan temple, one of Cambodia's oldest

Father: James 'Grizzly' Adams is a qualified pilot

Lindsey and Leslie's younger brother told Daily Mail Online: 'They didn't mean any harm, they didn't mean to disrespect any one.'

Rosser Adams, who lives with his mother Joy in Prescott, added that the worldwide media attention had been 'annoying' for the family and said they didn't plan to comment further.

Lindsey and Leslie's parents are separated and live in different homes in Prescott.

Their mom Joy lives in a modest bungalow in a suburb of the town, while dad James owns a large five-bed, four bath house worth $500,000 on a posh estate.

Neighbors say the two girls attend college and have been away from home, but split their time between both parents' houses when back.

One neighbor, who asked not to be named, told Daily Mail Online: 'James is a really nice guy so this will have come as a shock to him.

'The family is very conservative, so this isn't the kind of attention they would want.

'James is a commercial airline pilot and he can be back and forth from his house.

'He has three children, two daughters and a son, they all seem like nice kids.'

Adams, 60, nicknamed 'Grizzly' by friends – a reference to the famous 19th Century California mountain man and bear trainer James 'Grizzly' Adams - wasn't home when Daily Mail online visited yesterday.

The Aviation Business Gazette published an article about Adams in September, 2013 saying the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had recognized him by including the pilot in the FAA Airmen Certification Database.

The database, which appears on the agency's website at www.faa.gov, names Adams and other certified pilots who have met or exceeded the high educational, licensing and medical standards established by the FAA.

Internet searches suggest Adams, originally from Louisiana, works as an airline transport pilot, a flight instructor, ground instructor and mechanic.

A Facebook profile picture shows him dressed in a pilot's uniform and shows he's a member of the Taildragger Pilots United Facebook group.

Family home: The girls' mom and brother live in this bungalow in Prescott, Arizona

Father: Both girls and their brother split their time between their mother's home and their father's home, also in Prescott, Arizona

Taildragger is the aviation term for aircraft with a conventional undercarriage.

In May last year Adams obtained a firs- class medical designation to fly solo.

He also has a Aeronica 7AC fixed wing, single-engine, two seater plane registered in his name.

The girls' arrest is the second time in the last fortnight that tourists visiting the sprawling temple complex have been caught without their clothes.  

Three French tourists were deported last weekend after they pleaded guilty to taking nude pictures of each other inside another temple within the complex. 

The three deported French men received a suspended six-month prison sentence on two charges - public exposure and making pornography - and will be banned from re-entering Cambodia for four years.

The trio were caught just days after a series of photos of Asian women posing nude at ancient Cambodian temples went viral online and outraged officials who vowed to step up efforts to prevent similar stunts.
