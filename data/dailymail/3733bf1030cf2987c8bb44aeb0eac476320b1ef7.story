Alaa Mahmad (above), five, was killed after being hit by a car less than one month following his family settling into a new life in Arizona

A five-year-old boy was killed after  being hit by a car less than one month after his family was settling into a new life in Arizona.

Alaa Mahmad and his relatives fled from the ISIS-occupied Sinjar province in Iraq because his father Farhan Beeso, an interpreter for the US Army for two years, had received death threats from enemy forces.

After relocating to Tucson as refugees, the child was crossing the road on Wednesday night with his parents and three-year-old brother, who has not been named, when Alaa left his mother's side and was struck by the car.

As they left behind a life of horror in Iraq, Alaa and his family had only been settled in Tucson less than 30 days before he passed away, according to Tucson News Now.

Beeso said that ISIS was fighting in the province and that he and sons went to the mountain and saw children dying because they were without food and water.

'It was a very simple life but scary because of my religion. I am Yazidi. The Muslims, they was against my religion,' said Beeso.

'They thought we are devils, we worship the devils but we do not. We believe in God too, we don't hurt anybody.'

He also said that Yazidi women in the area were being raped and kidnapped by enemy forces and so he sought for a new life of safety for his family in the United States.

The boy's parents said he was very attached to them and always slept between them because he was afraid

As the family mourns the loss of their son (above father Farhan Beeso, right, and mother, Khalida, left), neighbors in the community have come together in support as a makeshift memorial has been created outside their apartment

The memorial has been laid with hand-made cards, flowers and teddy bears from those within the community

'I liked to be free first and the best thing I wished was the best for my family. I want the best future for my kid, I didn't want him to die in Iraq,' said Beeso.

Alaa, who has been described as a 'funny' boy, had been with his family on the night of February 11, after they had purchased bananas and ice cream and were returning home.

Beeso had gone across the street without using the crosswalk with the groceries, according to police.

His wife Khalida and two sons followed shortly after when Alaa broke free from his mother's hand and ran after his father.
