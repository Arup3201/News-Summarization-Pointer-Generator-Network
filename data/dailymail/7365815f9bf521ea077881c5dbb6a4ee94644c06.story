Lewis Hamilton took to Twitter to reveal his 'Woman Crush Wednesday' - his partner Nicole Scherzinger.

The F1 driver posted a snap of his pop star girlfriend cuddling a huge teddy bear on Wednesday night underneath the tweet: 'My woman #WCW' - a popular weekly trend on the social networking site.

Hamilton goes head-to-head with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg on Sunday at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix knowing victory would seal his second F1 title.

Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will go head-to-head in the final race of the season to decide the championship

Hamilton posted a picture of himself on Tuesday posing in front of a plane with the caption 'Just a kid from the UK that had a dream' ahead of Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

The showdown  is poised to unfold over the next few days at the Yas Marina circuit and, after 18 grands prix, 17 points separate Hamilton from Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg ahead of 'The Duel in the Desert'.

Contentiously, and for the first time in F1 history, double points are on offer to the top 10, affording Rosberg greater opportunity to take the championship.

Victory for Rosberg, with Hamilton third or worse, will see him claim a crown won by father Keke in 1982.
