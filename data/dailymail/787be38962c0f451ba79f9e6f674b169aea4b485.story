Real Madrid are close to agreeing terms on a new contract with Karim Benzema but have not given up on the pursuit of Radamel Falcao from Monaco.

Benzema is poised to agree an extension until 2017 on £5.5million a year.

Falcao has been the subject of a loan offer from Madrid who are concerned about proof of his recovery from cruciate surgery. The deal would be around £10m for the year with a view to a permanent deal next summer.

Former Monaco star James Rodriguez has told Spanish paper AS that he would like to see Falcao follow him to Spain. 

He said: 'I am sure he could play here. But it is not up to me to decide if he will come. It is the decision of the President. He can come because he has the quality and the mentality of a winner. 

'I’ve known him for four years and have played by his side. We were only separated when he left for Atletico. He has a winning mentality and that’s something you want at Madrid. I hope he can come.'

TEENAGE TALENT AT OLD TRAFFORD 

Some of the world's best teenage talent will descend on Carrington next week as Manchester United play host to the Premier Cup World Finals also known as the Nike Cup.

The tournament kicks off on August 6 with the final being held at Old Trafford three days later. Twenty Under 15 sides will take part from around the world including United and Chelsea.

Hidden gems: Lionel Messi and Fernando Torres are among those who have graced the Nike Cup

However, it won't be overflowing with scouts. Owing to accusations of poaching in recent years, access is strictly guarded through the clubs and only affiliated staff are allowed in.

Carlos Tevez, Theo Walcott, Fernando Torres and Lionel Messi are just some of the names to have graced the competition in the past.

PALACE TO COMPLETE HANGELAND DEAL 

Crystal Palace will win the battle to sign Brede Hangeland on Thursday.

The towering 33-year-old was released by Fulham via email at the end of the season and has held talks with Hull City with Steve Bruce keen to add experience alongside Curtis Davies and new signing Harry Maguire.

However, Tony Pulis has managed to convince the experienced Norwegian to stay in London and form a partnership with Scott Dann for next season.

London calling: Brede Hangeland is set to join Crystal Palace after he was released by Fulham

Hangeland left Craven Cottage under a cloud after six-and-a-half years in west London. He said he would have been willing to stay with Fulham in the Championship had he received assurances about the future direction of the club.

He said: 'With the right signs and the right players coming in I would have been prepared to stay.

'There was a release clause in my contract which they decided to take. I would have hoped for at least (to have been told) face-to-face or a pat on the back after six-and-a-half years.'

Fulham have since insisted that 'all personal protocol was followed' when Hangeland was informed of his release.

Hangeland is likely to have the last laugh though as he agrees a two-year deal.

BORO CLOSE IN ON NSUE 

Middlesbrough are poised to sign Real Mallorca captain Emilio Nsue. Spanish sources say the club are closing on the former Spain Under 21 international after he held talks to cancel his contract.

Boro boss Aitor Karanka coached Nsue while in charge of Spain's Under 20 side and has decided to bring him to England because of his versatility.

The 24-year-old was due to sign for Arsenal in 2010 but a family bereavement forced him to abandon the transfer and return to Mallorca.

Nsue who can play right wing, forward and right-back and was also part of the successful Spain Under 21 side that boasted the likes of Juan Mata, Thiago Alcantara and David de Gea. 

CLAYTON IN DEMAND 

In demand: Adam Clayton has several suitors

Huddersfield midfielder Adam Clayton is a man in demand.

The 25-year-old, who sported a spectacular blue and white beard for part of last season, is being pursued by four Championship clubs and is considering his options.

Clayton was voted as Huddersfield fans' player of the year last season and Brighton had a £1million bid rejected in January.

They have returned as have Middlesbrough but the presence of Cardiff and Reading could prove more revealing.

Cardiff are in the throes of selling Gary Medel to either Inter Milan or Galatasaray and want to strengthen their midfield while Reading want a proven Championship player who can make the step up to Premier League should they gain promotion.

Clayton, a former Manchester City graduate, is ready to leave once the clubs agree a price with Huddersfield.

TOTTENHAM IN THE MARKET

Tottenham are showing an interest in Mateo Musacchio of Villarreal. The tough Argentine defender has impressed a lot of scouts in recent years. He is not the tallest but reads the game well and has all the hallmarks of former Argentina captain Daniel Passarella. 

He is well known to Maurico Pochettino who is looking to toughen up his defence and has already shown he is willing to listen to offers for Michael Dawson while doubts remain over Younes Kaboul. 

Tottenham are hopeful of concluding a deal with Sporting Lisbon for Eric Dier but 23-year-old Tottenham are showing an interest in Mateo Musacchio of Villarrealwould be ready-made for the first team if they step up interest.

He won't come cheap though - his buy-out clause is £39million.

Tottenham midfielder Iago Falque, meanwhile, is undergoing a medical at Genoa.

COSTA RICA INTERNATIONAL OFF TO THE SEASIDER 

Jose Riga looks like getting one of the players he has been wishing for with the arrival of Costa Rica international midfielder Jose Miguel Cubero at Blackpool

The 27-year-old, who came off the bench to appear in four World Cup games this summer, posted a series of pictures of himself with Blackpool boss Riga at Bloomfield Road saying 'My new home'.

He is having his medical on Thursday ahead of signing.

DATE SET FOR SUAREZ HEARING

Luis Suarez has been told August 8 is the confirmed date when he will learn his fate over the four month ban imposed by FIFA. The Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) has called to hear out the appeal regarding Suarez’s suspension, where the player is looking to reduce the entire ban or at least several of the conditions in order to join and train with his new club, Barcelona.

Suarez and his lawyers will be in Lausanne, Switzerland, to testify and hear the verdict on their appeal. He is unlikely to have the entire ban lifted, but is hopeful that the ban will be reduced enough to allow him to be formally presented and train with Barcelona.

Biabiany, who joined Parma two years ago from Sampdoria for about £2m and has since extended his contract until 2018, is also on Southampton's list of potential targets.
