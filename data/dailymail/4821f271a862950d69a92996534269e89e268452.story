A policewoman stole a credit card from her mother's partner and used it to pay off the bill for a £6,000 holiday to Dubai.

Natalie Scott, 36, from Barrow, Cumbria, had popped into her mother's house during a shift when she pocketed Christopher McKellor's card.

Scott, who had worked for Cumbria Police for 12 years, quickly tried to use the card to pay for the trip for four, but the transaction did not go through.

She later used the card at Manchester Airport and settled the bill for the 10-day holiday four-person holiday.

The victim received a phone call from his bank, explaining there had been a transaction which took his card over the limit.

Scott was arrested two days after she returned from her holiday.

During the hearing at North Cumbria Magistrates' Court in Carlisle, Scott admitted theft and fraud by false representation. But she was spared an immediate prison sentence.

The former police officer wept in court as the details of her crime, which took place on May 15, were heard.

Mr John Moran, prosecuting, told the court Scott was questionned after Mr McKellor 
received the phone call from HSBC.

He said: 'While on duty in full police uniform she has stolen her mother’s partner’s credit card.

'She said she saw the credit card by the door. She picked up the card and put it in her pocket and left the house.

'She said she was suffering from stress and depression due to her financial situation.'

In mitigation, the court heard the crimes came 'out of desperation' and were a 'spur-of-the-moment stupid decision'.

She had offered to reimburse Mr McKellor, magistrates were told.

Scott was sentenced to eight weeks custody, suspended for a year. She was also ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work, pay £5,996 in compensation and £85 in court costs.

After the hearing, a spokeswoman for Cumbria Constabulary said: 'We expect the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and conduct from all police officers at all times and any allegations are investigated thoroughly.

'It is vital that our communities have trust and confidence in Cumbria Constabulary.'
