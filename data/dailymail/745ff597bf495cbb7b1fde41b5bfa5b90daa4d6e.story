Luis Suarez could get his four-month ban for biting put on hold so he can play from the start of the season.

FIFA rejected an appeal by Suarez and the Uruguay Football Federation against his suspension for biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini.

Suarez is now considering an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), asking them to suspend the ban pending their verdict.

Chance: Suarez could still get his ban put on hold via the Court of Arbitration of Sport

CAS could refuse but, if agreed, it could mean Suarez being available at the start of the domestic season, which is expected to be with Barcelona when the striker’s move from Liverpool is confirmed.

The downside is that if the CAS agreed, Suarez would lose the close-season part of his ban and miss even more football if helost his appeal. That issue would be a key part of transfer discussions between Liverpool and Barcelona.

Suarez’s ban was imposed on June 26 and as well as the four-match ban from all football activity, there was a nine-match international ban and a £66,000 fine.

FIFA head of media Delia Fischer confirmed CAS could order the ban to be suspended while it dealt with the case.

Decision: Suarez has 10 days to request the full written reasons for the appeal being rejected by FIFA

If Suarez wants to pursue the matter he has 10 days to request the full written reasons for the appeal being rejected by FIFA, after which he can lodge a further appeal with CAS.

Barcelona have offered the £75million buy-out clause for Suarez and their club doctor has been sent to Uruguay to assess him before a medical.

However, the doctor is also visiting Brazil first to check on Neymar’s cracked vertebrae.

Barcelona are awaiting confirmation of Alexis Sanchez’s move to Arsenal before closing the deal with Liverpool but hope to unveil Suarez, 27, next week.

Meanwhile, Liverpool plan talks and medical tests for Lazar Markovic on Friday before a £19.8m move from Benfica.
