A lottery winner who split from his wife after they scooped a £148million jackpot will marry a stable girl in a James Bond-themed ceremony, it is claimed.

Adrian Bayford proposed to Samantha Burbidge, 16 years his junior, after just six weeks, friends said.

Miss Burbidge, 27, has left her job as head groom of a stables. It is thought she will walk down the aisle to the theme tune of the 007 films.

film The Man With The Golden Gun.

The
 eccentric wedding plans have been laid after a whirlwind romance which started just six weeks ago.

Adrian
 and Samantha are said to have met in January and just three weeks 
later, she gave up her job and moved in with her new lover.

Mr Bayford, who split 
from his wife Gillian, 41, in November, blamed the lottery win on the breakdown of his nine-year marriage.

Their nine-year marriage 'broke down irretrievably' 15 months after the second biggest UK lottery win ever

The couple said their marriage had ‘broken down irretrievably’ 15 months after scooping 
Britain’s second biggest lottery prize ever.

It
 is understood he proposed to Miss Burbidge during a candlelit 
dinner on the beach during their holiday at a plush £500-a-night resort in the Maldives.

Two weeks ago Miss Burbidge had posted a picture on Facebook of her standing on a sun-drenched beach.

The
 pair only returned from overseas this week and were spotted looking 
tanned and relaxed as they celebrated their engagement at a pub near his
 home in Haverhill, Suffolk, with steak, chips and pints of cider.

Adrian and Gillian Bayford bought this £6million Georgian mansion shortly after their big lottery win. However, they both moved out of it a few months later after announcing their decision to split

Later
 the 20st former postman left his new fiancée at home while he headed 
out for a celebratory kebab, according to The Sun. He confirmed to the paper 
that he was newly engaged.

'I
 didn't get down on one knee, but I proposed on the beach during a meal.
 It was beautiful. I'm over the moon she said yes,' he said.

A friend of Miss Burbidge said the pair had been 'like a couple of teenagers'.

'Samantha
 looks like the cat that's got the cream and Adrian is completely 
smitten with her,' the friend said, adding that Miss Burbidge was in 
'wedding planning overdrive'.

Mr Bayford is now said to be living in this £500,000 house in Suffolk with his new bride-to-be Samantha Burbidge

Miss
 Burbidge had been working at a stable in Thurlow, close to Mr Bayford's 
home in Haverhill, when the pair met in a pub in January. Three weeks 
later she had moved into his five-bedroom, £500,000 home.

Mrs
 Bayford, mother of Mr Bayford's two children, declined to comment when 
contacted by The Sun last night.

Last month it was reported that Mr
 Bayford – who actually bought the winning EuroMillions ticket – had developed a ‘friendly relationship’ with Polish-born Marta Jarosz, 30.

Miss
 Jarosz, who lives in a terraced home close to Mr Bayford’s, works as a 
nightclub bouncer and is thought to have met him while he was on a night
 out.

Mr Bayford told the 
Mail at the time of the split from his wife: ‘Gillian and I have split. 
When you win the lottery it’s so stressful. Things happen. Sometimes in 
life you have to move on. We’re all happy now and life goes on.’

Working relationship: Adrian Bayford at Stansted Airport with Marta Jarosz. He denied they were an item and said she was his 'bodyguard and driver'

They
 strenuously denied that anyone else was involved and Mrs Bayford 
brushed off rumours that she had become close to their bodybuilding 
groundsman Chris Tovey, 40.

He
 worked for the couple until he claimed he was hit by a golf buggy 
driven by Mr Bayford on their 200-acre estate and is now thought to be 
taking legal action against them.

In
 December, it was reported that Mrs Bayford was in a relationship with 
car dealer Alan Warnock, who sold her some of her fleet of cars.

They
 met in October last year, when the Bayfords visited Gillian’s parents 
in Scotland – and were sold five luxury vehicles at an Audi dealership 
by Mr Warnock.

Mrs Bayford, a
 former hospital healthcare worker in Cambridge, is now thought to have 
set up home with the sales manager in an exclusive estate in her home 
town of Dundee.
