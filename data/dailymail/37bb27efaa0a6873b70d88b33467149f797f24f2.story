Pest: Cannibal slugs have invaded Britain's gardens and eats carrion, excrement and its own kind

It sounds like the plot of a 1950s B-movie – giant slugs have invaded and gone on the rampage in English gardens and allotments.

The six-inch-long monsters have a voracious appetite and gardeners and growers fear their crops and prize plants will be annihilated.

The Spanish slugs, which have also been nicknamed killer slugs, also feed on dead mice, meat and even each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets.

Sightings have been reported as far afield as East Anglia, the West Midlands, the New Forest, the South East coast and London.

Victims of this modern Spanish armada include Graham Cornell, who found dozens of them feasting on his garden in Lode, Cambridgeshire.

‘I’ve never seen anything like them,’ he said ‘They’re huge and they leave a trail behind them half an inch wide,’ he said.

‘They don’t seem to be affected by pellets – the only way to stop them is to spear them. Luckily, I’ve finished growing many of the things in my garden so they haven’t done as much damage as they might have done.’ 

The gastropods – classed as among the 100 most invasive species in Europe – were first spotted here in 2010 but cold weather helped kill them off.

A large number were found in East Anglia last year and are believed to have hitched a lift on salad leaves imported from the Continent. 

This time the mild weather and, in particular, the lack of morning frosts has allowed them to thrive. 

There are fears they could breed with native species, creating a hybrid that can tolerate cold. 

Experts have warned of a ‘disaster waiting to happen’ if they become established in Britain because of their appetites and resistance to existing controls. Crops on farms could be devastated.

Despite their name, Spanish slugs could have originated in western France.

They eat dead or weaker members of their own species and other slugs.

Like all slugs, they are hermaphrodites – meaning just one can produce an infestation.

The Spanish slugs adapted to hot climates, where eggs are at risk of drying out, by laying hundreds. 

However, in our wet weather, most survive.

Predators such as hedgehogs, and ducks control slugs – but this species is less likely to be tackled by these animals.

A Cannibal slug is brownish in colour, is between eight and 12cm long and can be found in most of Europe. 

A typical black slug, in comparison, is normally between 10 and 12cm long and is mostly found in northern Europe. 

It is omnivorous, feeding mostly on dead animals, fungi and vegetation.  

They also threaten indigenous species – which are natural composters – by bringing new diseases and parasites.

Other countries affected by the slug – Latin name Arion vulgaris – include Sweden and Norway where their slime became a skid hazard on roads. Steven Falk, an entomologist with the charity Buglife, confirmed the explosion in numbers.

‘It was a very slug-friendly winter,’ he said. ‘Frost is the enemy of the adult and we haven’t had one.’

Gardening writer Colin Hambidge added native slugs had also benefited from the mild weather.

‘There are loads and many of them are pretty big too. It’s the worst we’ve ever experienced. We really need a much harder winter this year.’
