A toddler suffered severe nerve damage to his face after being attacked by a dog off its leash while playing in a park with his mother this weekend. 

One-year-old Kaidyn Sutton was rushed to the hospital with large gashes to his eyes and cheek after the black dog approached him and his mother in a French Valley, California park. He underwent surgery Friday night, but doctors say it's likely he'll be left with long-term damage from the mauling. 

The dog was later found at a house on the outskirts of the park and officials will now decide whether to return the dog to its owners or put the animal down.

1-year-old Kaidyn Sutton was viciously mauled by a dog this weekend while playing in a park with his mother 

The dog was identified the day after the attack, living at a house two doors down from the park. Kaidyn's mother says the dog did not have a collar or leash on at the time of the attack 

Kaidyn's mother Michaela says her son, just one month shy of his second birthday, suffered lasting nerve damage

Michaela Sutton, her son and the boy's godmother were playing in Primrose Park Friday afternoon around 4pm when the black dog suddenly approached and  grabbed hold of the boy's face.

'He was running around in the grass playing when a dog...came out of nowhere and attacked him -- latched onto his face and just mauled him,' the boy's grandfather Glenn Garrett told NBC Los Angeles.

Kaidyn's godmother was able to wrench the ferocious dog off him,  but not before the animal ripped up the little boy's face. 

The boy, just one month shy of his second birthday, was rushed to Loma Linda Medical Center where doctors performed surgery overnight to fix the injuries to his forehead and cheek. 

'He is out they said he did great, he looks great. There may be some nerve damage in his forehead and they fixed one tendon that works one eyebrow but couldn't exactly pinpoint the other but (because) he's so little they hope it will grow back,' Sutton said in a Facebook update. 

Doctors say the boy may need to undergo further surgeries before he is fully recovered.  He was expected to be released from the hospital on Sunday. 

On Saturday, the godmother identified the dog at a house just two doors down from the park. 

Residents expressed shock that the seemingly nice 6-year-old black lab named Dexter was responsible for the attack.

The dog was removed from the home by Animal Services and a hearing will be scheduled to decide whether to put down the dog or return it to its owners. 

They say the dog was not involved in any prior incidents, and that it was vaccinated for rabies and microchipped. 

Neighbors say the 6-year-old black lab called Dexter had always appeared to be friendly
