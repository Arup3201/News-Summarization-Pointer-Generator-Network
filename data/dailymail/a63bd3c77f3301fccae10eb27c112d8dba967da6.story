A former Fortune 500 executive has admitted that he killed a pregnant woman and her fiancé when he tried to kill himself by driving his pickup truck across a highway median into oncoming traffic.

Robert Dellinger, 54, pleaded guilty on Thursday to negligent homicide for the deaths of 24-year-old Amanda Murphy and 29-year-old Jason Timmons, of Wilder, Vermont. 

He also pleaded guilty to assault for the death of their fetus. Murphy was eight months pregnant.

Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was initially charged with manslaughter, but that was later upgraded to second-degree murder. 

Pleaded guilty: Robert Dellinger, 54, has admitted to killing two people as he tried to kill himself on a highway

Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013

'I’m extremely remorseful to the families, and to my own family, as well. I wish I could have that day over,' Dellinger said in court.

Negligent homicide is a lesser charge. Dellinger will be sentenced in April.

Dellinger, who held high-level posts at PPG Industries Inc., Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., told investigators he was trying to kill himself on December 7, 2013, when he steered his pickup across a highway median in Lebanon, New Hampshire.  

His truck became airborne and sheared the top off of the victims' SUV, causing injuries so severe that the medical examiner said the couple looked like they had been in a plane crash.

The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly.

Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median

Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter.

Miss Murphy, 24, was excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their unborn baby girl Reagan Elizabeth.

A week before the crash, the residential center where the couple worked together hosted a baby shower for them.

Catherine Amarante, executive director at the facility, described the couple as 'very loving'.

Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, 2013, a few days after the crash

Excited: Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons, pictured with one of his three children from a previous relationship, were looking forward to the arrival of their baby girl

Mr Timmons, 29, was also a father to three children from a previous relationship. 

According to prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his 
medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported.

'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' 

Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, 
however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a 
'productive and exemplary life.'

The married father had served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc.

He
 took a severance package worth more than $1 million in cash plus stocks
 when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

After
 his earlier arraignment, Dellinger had been freed on $250,000 cash bond
 and ordered to wear an electronic tag and undergo a psychiatric 
evaluation.
