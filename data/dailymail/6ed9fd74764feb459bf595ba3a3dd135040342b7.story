Reality TV star Jack Tweed is alleged to have harassed his ex-girlfriend, the glamour model and former Big Brother contestant Chanelle Hayes.

The 27-year-old, who was left a widower when wife Jade Goody died from cancer in 2009, faces charges of assault, criminal damage and threatening behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence. 

He is also facing a charge of using threatening behaviour to cause harassment, which relates to Miss Hayes, 27.

Officers were called to a branch of McDonald's in Chelmsford, Essex, at 4am in October. Tweed, 27, has now been charged and bailed until next month, when he will appear before Chelmsford magistrates, reports the Sun on Sunday.

He denied the charges when contacted by MailOnline. 

Chanelle and Jack, a club promoter, have had a rocky romance and she previously claimed they both can't live with each other or without each other.

Chanelle was dating former Middlesborough footballer Matthew Bates back in 2010 when she got pregnant with their child.

The two are now no longer in contact and Chanelle then moved on to Jack, dating during her pregnancy and splitting just three weeks before son Blakeley's birth, before later reuniting.

One of the reasons for their rocky romance was the grief Jack was still experiencing over his late wife Jade Goody, who died in 2009 following a cancer battle.

At one point it all became too much for Chanelle who tweeted: 'Absololutely f**king sick of living up to a ghost and never coming close. What's been the point to my last three years of my life then?!'

The two finally appeared to call it quits after Jack appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show last May, talking about his late wife.

Miss Hayes' representative refused to comment.
