Major League Baseball umpire Dale Scott says he is gay, the latest such disclosure in sports.

Scott has been a member of the big league staff since 1986 - meaning 29 seasons - and is a crew chief. He worked the World Series in 1998, 2001 and 2004.

The 55-year-old told the website Outsports.com he married Michael Rausch in November 2013 and that MLB and the other umpires were aware of his sexuality. 

Scott said he made a deliberate decision to go public in a low-key manner. He had provided Referee magazine a photo of himself with Rausch going to last year's opening series in Sydney for an October story.

The caption in the issue stated: 'He and his longtime companion, Michael Rausch, traveled to Australia for the 2014 season opener between the Diamondbacks and Dodgers.'

Scott said in a story posted by Outsports on Tuesday that 'My thought process was, is that there's a story about my career and how I got started in umpiring and they're talking to people I have known since junior high and it didn't seem right to have a whole story and pictures without a picture of Mike and I, someone who's been with me through this entire process. We met the October after my first year in the big leagues.

'Obviously, when I sent that picture to Jeff [Stern, Referee magazine's editor], I knew exactly what it meant. In a small way, this was opening that door in a publication that wasn't going to be circulated nationwide. It could be picked up, but it's not Time magazine. I made that decision to go ahead and do it because I felt it was the right thing to do.'

He continued, 'I realized that it could open a Pandora's Box, but this is not a surprise to Major League Baseball, the people I work for. It's not a surprise to the umpire staff. Until Mike and I got married last November, he was my same-sex domestic partner and had his own MLB I.D. and was on my insurance policy.

'This is not going to be some huge flashing news to Park Avenue [MLB headquarters], but I also didn't want to be making some coming out story, some banner headline, because that's not how I operate. It's not a shock to MLB management because they're well aware of my situation and it's not a shock to the umpire staff. If it would have been, I don't think I would have done it.'

Scott did not hear from anyone regarding the publication of the image showing him and his husband though he received congratulatory comments for the profile, Outsports reported.

According to the website, Scott and Rausch first crossed paths when they were both at the same Portland gay bar in 1986.

Scott told Outsports 'It's still a headline, look at Michael Sam. People scream at me because I'm an umpire. The last thing I want is people screaming at me because I'm gay. I'm an umpire who happens to be gay. I'm not trying to be some gay person who happens to be an umpire.'

Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig praised Scott.

'To his friends and colleagues throughout the game, Dale is universally regarded as a class act,' he said in a statement. 'All of us at Major League Baseball are very proud of him, just as we have always been.' 

Scott's decision to go public follows that of others in sports.

Basketball center Jason Collins became the first openly gay player in one of the major North American professional leagues in April 2013. He announced his retirement last month at age 35.

Defensive end Michael Sam, the Southeastern Conference's 2013 co-defensive player of the year, came out in February. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams with the 249th pick in May, cut in August, signed by Dallas for its practice squad, then released by the Cowboys in October.

Midfielder Robbie Rogers announced he was gay in February 2013 following his release from Leeds in England. He signed with Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy that May and has revived his career this year with a move to defender.

University of Massachusetts junior guard Derrick Gordon became the first openly gay player in Division I men's basketball in April. He made his announcement on ESPN and Outsports.

Other out professional players include WNBA stars Brittney Griner and Seimone Augustus and National Women's Soccer League players Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe.
