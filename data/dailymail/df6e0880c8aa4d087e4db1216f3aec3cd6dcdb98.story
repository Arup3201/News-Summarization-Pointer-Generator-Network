The Prime Minister praised the Westminster correspondents for probing, inquiring and scrutinising

David Cameron last night praised the vital role of the Press as the 'linchpins of our democracy'.

In a speech to journalists, he said media freedom in the UK is held up as an example around the world.

'At its best, the British Press and the political Press has a vital role to play in our country,' the Prime Minister said.

'Rowdy, tenacious, uncontrollable, sceptical, often uncomfortable for us politicians, British political reporting is deservedly respected around the world for the way it probes, inquires and scrutinises.

'These things are linchpins of our democracy.'

He said that newspapers can make life difficult for politicians but Britain was 'fortunate' to have reporters who call them to account.

Addressing a Westminster correspondents' dinner in the House of Commons – held for the first time since 1974 – the Prime Minister gave a self-deprecating speech about his various encounters with journalists.

But he finished on a serious note, recalling a trip he made to a Tamil newspaper in northern Sri Lanka at the end of last year while attending the Commonwealth summit.

He said the stories of the reporters who had suffered violence and even the deaths of their colleagues had reminded him of the value of Press freedom.

'It was an incredibly powerful moment. It was a reminder of just how fortunate we are in this country to have a Press that is free, that is open, that is able to stand up to the powerful,' he added.

'By the nature of our of jobs, the relationship between politicians and journalists is often a confrontational one.

'You slag us off, we rage about you, repeat ad infinitum,' the Prime Minister said.

'But at the heart of it we are all here because we care about politics and we care about public life.'

Mr Cameron also joked about the awarding of an MBE to his hairdresser, Lino Carbosiero, saying that his priority for 2014 was 'keeping the bald spot under control'.
