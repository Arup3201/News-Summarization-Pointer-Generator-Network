Jordan Stapleton was shot in his own home in Leeds just yards away from his sleeping son

A young father was gunned down in his bathroom just yards from his sleeping four-year-old son, police have revealed.

Jordan Stapleton, 21, was shot at around 11.45pm on Tuesday at his home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, and police have appealed for an unnamed man who made the 999 call moments after to come forward.

The father-of-one had a single gunshot wound to the chest and despite attempts to treat him at the scene he was pronounced dead a short time later.

Detectives believe the caller may hold
crucial evidence in the case. The mystery caller, who refused to give 
his name, used a phone box a short distance from the crime scene.

A
police spokesman said: 'He believed he had heard a gunshot as he walked
down a nearby alleyway. After the anonymous caller gave the address as 
the likely origin of the gunshot he is heard to hang up.'

As well as tracing the caller, murder detectives are also looking to trace single Jordan's movement in the hours before he died.

Speaking
today, Det Supt Scott Wood, of West Yorkshire Police's Homicide and 
Major Inquiry Team, said: 'Jordan Stapleton was shot in cold blood in 
his own home.

'The fact his 
young son was asleep yards away in his bedroom makes the crime even more
disturbing. I can confirm Jordan died of a single gunshot wound to the 
chest.

'Regarding the 
anonymous call, we really want that caller to come forward. He is a 
vital witness so we are tying to trace him. If he could come forward or 
anyone who recognises the voice.

'I am appealing for anyone who can 
help us piece together Jordan's movements on Tuesday evening. I want to 
hear from anyone who might have information as to who is responsible.

'The
mother of Jordan dropped him and her grandson off at 6pm at their home 
address. We know he was alive and well at 6pm and the shooting happened 
about 11.45. So it is those six hours we are really trying to nail down.

When
asked if there was any indication Jordan had any grievances with 
anyone, Det Supt Wood said: 'At the moment we are still putting that 
together, it's still early days from the shooting.

'We are still trying to get in contact with family, friends, relatives and we are gleaning that information.'

There was no sign of a break-in in at the house, the front door was open but it isn't known who left it open

Regarding the caller, he said: 'We are taking it at face value he is just a passer by, but there may be more to it than that.

'We wouldn't be foolish enough to think there may be no other background but as it stands he said "I walked by and I heard this" so he is a viable witness.

'I would like to reassure the caller that any information provided to us will be treated in the strictest confidence and I would urge them to get in touch.'

Det Supt Wood said there was no sign of a break-in in at the house, adding that the front door was open but it isn't known who left it open.

At this point he was unable to clarify what type of gun had been used in the crime. Jordan's son, who was unharmed during the incident, is staying with his grandmother.

'Jordan's son is fine, he is with Jordan's mother who is used to looking after him. The rest of the family are in shock,' said Det Supt Wood.
