Following reports of phones crashing and data being lost, more users have come forward to complain about other problems with their Apple devices since updating to the latest iOS 7.1.1 software.

Users have told MailOnline that phones are dying despite having battery life, while apps and Apple services have begun freezing or acting erratically.

Apple pushed out the minor update for its iOS software earlier this week and some users have been left having to restore their devices, consequently losing all their pictures, apps and other personal data.

Apple pushed out its iOS 7.1.1 software this week - but there are already reports of it causing problems.  Users have been posting on the official Apple Support forum complaining that the update has 'bricked' their phone - a term used to describe a phone that won't switch on

When updating an iOS device there are 
two options - over the air, or via iTunes.

When using OTA, the phone has
 to be plugged into a charger. 

Before any update, Apple advises users 
to backup their devices to iCloud or iTunes.

Users must also make sure they have 
enough storage space to accommodate the update.

If there isn't enough space, users can either use iTunes to update the phone, or remove content in Usage settings.

Go to Settings, General and Software Update and click Download and Install. 

When updating over iTunes, users must be running the latest version of the software.

More details can be found on Apple's official support page.

According to the initial reports, the majority of the problems occurred when trying to update the devices using Wi-Fi, also known as Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.

However, a number of customers have had the same issue when updating over a cable.

One person told MailOnline: 'Mine was on the cable all the time during the update and still it has crashed.

'I’ve tried restoring three times now and it fails with an ‘internal error’. Not sure where to go now, Apple are much less than helpful.'

Meanwhile, another Apple phone owner explained that since updating his iPad, Apple's Safari app freezes and crashes 'for no reason'.

There have also been reports of problems using the built-in email app with notes appearing randomly, for example.

Although the majority of affected users have been complaining about the phone crashing during the update, on user told MailOnline her phone updated normally, but has since 'switched itself off and still won't turn on'.

These complaints are a selection of those received.

The problems appear to have affected a range of models, including the iPhone 4S, iPhone, iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S, when using the wireless option.

An Apple forum user said: ‘I was installing the update and now I am stuck in recovery mode.  Have to restore device.’

Another added: ‘I'm also stuck in recovery mode after updating my iPhone 4s to 
7.1.1’, followed by: ‘First time it bricked my phone 
going from 7.1 to 7.1.1 on my iPhone 5.’

However, the reports seem to be coming from a minority, as other users have updated their devices with no problems at all.

Nigel
 Cartwright told MailOnline that 'tens of millions' of people have 
likely installed the update and the problems are simply coming from a 
small proportion.

There
 is also a distinction between 'bricked' devices which are typically not
 salvageable, and those which are in recovery mode and can be fixed via a
 reset.

The 7.1.1 update is a relatively minor release compared to the previous 7.1 roll-out. It was issued to improve battery life, fix bugs and update the software’s security.

The 7.1.1 update is a relatively minor update compared to the previous 7.1 release. It was issued to improve battery life, fix bugs and update the software's security as well as resolve a 'fade' problem with the TouchID fingerprint recognition on the iPhone 5S. This problem caused scans to intermittently fail

Elsewhere, the TouchID fingerprint recognition on the iPhone 5S has been patched as part of 7.1.1 to fix a 'fade' issue that caused scans to fail intermittently.  

It was also designed to sort out a bug that interfered with the responsiveness of the keyboard across older devices.  

Apple iOS 7.1.1 is compatible with all devices running iOS 7.1, including the iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5C and 5S, the iPad Air, iPad 2, 3, 4, iPad mini, iPad mini with Retina display and the latest iPod Touch.

The total update is around 26MB. 

Before any update, Apple advises users backup their devices to iCloud or iTunes and make sure they have enough storage space to accommodate the update. 

The latter has been known to cause problems in the past, and will prevent the update completing. 

MailOnline has approached Apple for comment.
