A retired police officer who 
investigated the scene of a baby snatched by a dingo has said he still 
has doubts about the case, despite the child's mother being acquitted of
murder and a coroner's ruling in her favour.

Frank Morris went 
to Uluru the night nine-week-old Azaria Chamberlain disappeared but he 
says there must have been some human intervention.

Speaking
about the result of the fourth inquest he said: 'If you go to 
court enough times, you are bound to get a win sooner or later.'

Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton said there was nothing she or her then husband, Michael could have done to change people's minds

Azaria went missing from an Outback 
campsite near Ayers Rock 32 years ago and the case divided Australia 
with half the country believing Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton's account that a dingo or wild dog 
took the baby from their tent and the other half saying her parents killed her.

There were emotional scenes yesterday 
when the verdict was delivered. Azaria’s mother Lindy, now 64, tearfully
embraced her former husband Michael and other family members in the 
courtroom.

Today she gave a rare interview today in the 
northern city of Darwin where Elizabeth Morris, the Northern Territory coroner, ruled in her favour saying she was 'satisfied that the evidence is sufficiently adequate, clear, cogent
and exact and that the evidence excludes all other reasonable 
possibilities' than that the baby was taken by one or more dingoes.

She
said she is writing a book about forgiveness and welcomed approaches 
from people who doubted her including one of the jurors who convicted 
her of murder.

Mrs 
Chamberlain-Creighton told Australian Broadcasting Corp: 'I think they 
have a huge amount of courage to admit that they were wrong.

'There are still people saying "I don't care what the evidence was. I've made up my mind and I don't want to listen to sense".'

Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton was convicted in 1982 when it was believed she slit Azaria's throat with a pair of nail scissors.

She
was given a life sentence for murder but served just three years in a 
Darwin prison before being exonerated and the case was depicted in the 
1988 film A Cry in the Dark.

In the 32 years since she cried out 
in the night ‘A dingo’s got my baby!’, there have been four inquests and
a government inquiry into nine-week-old Azaria’s death.

One
piece of evidence that continues to fuel doubt is the fact that her 
baby-grow was found in relatively good condition near a dingo lair in 
1986.

The coroner said would have been 'very difficult' for the animal to have removed it, but added that it was possible.

Many Australians had doubts about Mrs
Chamberlain-Creighton and her then husband, Michael, when they saw 
their cool demeanour on TV shortly after the tragedy.

Speaking about that she said there was nothing they could have done to change people's minds.

'It
wouldn't have mattered what we did. If we didn't react exactly the same
as the individual watching us reacted, that individual thought we were 
being weird.

Trial: Lindy and Michael Chamberlain leave a courthouse in Alice Springs, Australia in February 1982. She was originally jailed for murdering baby Azaria while he was given a suspended sentence

'So if you smile, that's dreadful; you
should be crying. And if you don't smile you're hard-hearted. And if 
you cry all the time, you're a drama queen,' she added.

She said Meryl Streep was surprised 
that her sense of humour did not match her public persona when the pair 
met before the actress played Chamberlain-Creighton in 'A Cry in the 
Dark.'

Streep said: 'I thought I had it all 
down pat, your role, but you've just blown me out of the water in 10 
minutes,' Chamberlain-Creighton told Nine Network.

Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton was released in 1986 after 
Englishman David Brett fell to his death while climbing Ayers Rock – 
known today by its Aboriginal name of Uluru – and landed beside a 
matinee jacket that was vital to her defence.

She had told police that no dingo saliva had been found on Azaria’s jumpsuit
because the baby was wearing a matinee jacket over the jumpsuit, but no
jacket was found at the time the child disappeared.

Ordeal: Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton served six years for her murder before being acquitted in 1988. She had always claimed that a dingo killed their child.

A third inquest in 1995 could not 
determine the cause of death. Mr Chamberlain, who was convicted of being
an accessory after the fact of murder but later exonerated, then fought
a long legal battle for a fourth inquest.

That inquest heard new evidence of dingo attacks, including three fatal attacks on children since the third inquest.

Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton, who has two
sons and a daughter who was born shortly after she started her prison 
term, has been spat at and abused by members of the public over the 
years.

Outside court, she said she was 
‘relieved and delighted to come to the end of this saga’ and that the 
verdict was ‘such a vindication’ for her and her former husband.

She wept when asked what she thought 
her Azaria might be like if she had lived – the day before would have 
been her 32nd birthday.
