Doreen Lawrence is being given a seat in the House of Lords, 20 years after her son Stephen was murdered by racists.

The respected campaigner for justice will be made a baroness in a list of peerages expected to be published today.

She will sit on the Labour benches as a working peer specialising in race and diversity.

Peerage: Doreen Lawrence is to become a Labour member of the House of Lords, 20 years after the murder of her son Stephen

Honour: As the co-founder of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, Mrs Lawrence received the OBE in 2003

Welcoming the news, Shami Chakrabarti,
 of human rights group Liberty, said: ‘Who can imagine transforming the 
grief of losing a child into a campaign to reform policing and the wider
 values of an entire nation?’

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna tweeted: ‘Arise Baroness Doreen Lawrence!’

Mrs Lawrence, 60, who received an OBE 
in 2003, has campaigned tirelessly for justice for her 18-year-old son, 
who was stabbed to death after being ambushed by five white youths while
 waiting at a bus stop in Eltham, South London, in April 1993.

She founded the Stephen Lawrence 
Charitable Trust to help young people from ethnic minorities pursue 
their ambitions, and has sat on Home Office and police panels.

Politics: In April senior politicians from all parties joined Mrs Lawrence at the 20th anniversary memorial of the death of Stephen - including, from left to right, Police Minister Damian Green, Home Secretary Theresa May, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Prime Minister David Cameron, Labour leader Ed Milliband, who recommended her for the peerage, and London Mayor Boris Johnson

Labour declined to officially confirm or deny the appointment yesterday.

The Daily Mail has long campaigned for justice for Stephen Lawrence's family, including front page headlines naming suspects in the case

But a source said: ‘Doreen Lawrence is
 a hero of modern Britain.

'The strength and courage she has shown in her
 fight for justice has had a profound impact on attitudes to racism and 
policing.

'Her campaigning has changed our country for the better.’

At a memorial service on April 22 – 
two decades after the tragedy – Mrs Lawrence said Britain had become 
fairer after her son made the ‘ultimate sacrifice’.

She added: ‘I’ve tried to focus on the
 positive since Stephen’s murder, and looked to see how I can make the 
lives of others better.’

Mrs Lawrence’s improved relations with
 police suffered a blow last month following disputed claims that 
officers tried to carry out a smear campaign against her family in the 
aftermath of Stephen’s murder.

It took nearly 19 years before she and
 her family saw two of Stephen’s killers jailed after Gary Dobson, 37, 
and David Norris, 36, were convicted of his murder last year.
