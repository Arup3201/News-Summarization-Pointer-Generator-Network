A cat hid undiscovered inside the engine of a campervan for four days while the vehicle underwent an MOT test and a service, it has been revealed.

Oliver was snuggled under the bonnet of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 316 vehicle - but was missed by mechanics, who carried out work including an oil change.

His owner Clare Waterfield, 49, and her two children Tara, 15, and Jorge, 12, had searched for their beloved tabby after he vanished from their home in Plymouth, Devon.

Missed by mechanics: Oliver was snuggled under the bonnet of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 316 vehicle

In the meantime, the family broke off from the hunt to take her motor home to her local garage for an MOT test and a full service.

Staff checked for faults and carried out essential maintenance before handing back the keys to her.

But after the car was back home, the family's other cat Benji began sniffing the campervan's bonnet - and they heard a quiet meow when they went to investigate.

They opened up the bonnet and were amazed to see Oliver beneath the engine block. It took her 30 minutes to coax the pet out of his hiding place but he eventually emerged completely unscathed.

Sports therapist Mrs Waterfield said: ‘We're just relieved to have him back. He's so timid and doesn't normally go out. It took us half an hour to coax him out of the motor home.’

Mechanics scoured the campervan for faults before failing its MOT because of an exhaust problem.

Nearly two years old: The family took in Oliver as a young kitten from a rescue centre in Devon

But despite changing the oil and cleaning the engine filters, missing tabby Oliver was able to avoid detection as they worked on the vehicle for several hours.

The family took in Oliver as a young kitten from a rescue centre close to their gated mews home.

Oliver, nearly two years old, managed to creep out when a stone got caught in a security door, leaving it slightly ajar overnight.

Mrs Waterfield, her husband Brian, 69, and Tara and Jorge, noticed he had gone on May 11.

Mrs Waterfield said: ‘We walked up and down the streets searching for him. I rang the vets, the RPSCA, everyone I could think of. Oliver is a member of the family. He's my daughter's cat so she was particularly upset. The campervan was parked in the street outside. I did have a look underneath but I couldn't see him.’

Semi-retired motor dealer Mr Waterfield was due, meanwhile, to take the campervan to a local garage for a service and MOT test. He broke off from the search on May 12 to deliver the vehicle before picking it up several hours later.

A day later Mrs Waterfield and Tara resumed the hunt, this time taking along ten-month-old Benji in the hope he could help find his missing feline pal.

Explanation: Oliver's owners think he probably crept out of the engine area while the mechanics worked on the car and hid in a different part of the undercarriage, possibly next to the vehicle's water tank

Mrs Waterfield said: ‘I saw Tara at the gate with Benji in her hands and said, “put him back, I don't want to lose another cat”. But Tara thought Benji could help us in the search so I let her bring him along.

Reunited: Mrs Waterfield, 49, said her beloved tabby Oliver was 'a member of the family'

‘A little later Benji started meowing and I realised I could hear a second meow coming from somewhere. I looked up and down the street and at the houses before I realised it was coming from the campervan. I shouted at Brian to get the keys and we looked under the bonnet.

‘All I could see at first was some fir then a head suddenly pooped out. He was right at the front, tucked up beside the radiator, and we had a real job coaxing him out with some food.

‘He smelt a bit oily but he was otherwise fine. We gave him two packets of cat food and a bowl of milk which he finished in one gulp - he hadn't eaten for days.’

Mr and Mrs Waterfield think Oliver probably crept out of the engine area while the mechanics worked on the car and hid in a different part of the undercarriage, possibly next to the vehicle's water tank.

Mrs Waterfield added: ‘He's quite timid but he likes the campervan and he's familiar with it. There are several little hidey-holes underneath. He probably went back to the engine afterwards because it's snug and warm.’

Her husband added: ‘The guys at the garage did a thorough job. He probably wasn't in the engine when they opened it up.

‘Ironically, it failed the MOT because of the exhaust pipe and had to go back in. They wouldn't have had any reason to check all the nooks and crannies underneath.’
