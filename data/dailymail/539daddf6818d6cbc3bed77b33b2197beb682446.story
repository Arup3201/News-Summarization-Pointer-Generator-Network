The makers of new horror film Devil’s Due weren’t content for the scares to be confined to movie theaters.

They thought up a devilishly mischievous prank that has been fraying the nerves of New Yorkers and filmed the results for a YouTube video called Devil Baby Attack.

There is absolutely no dialogue in the video – just screaming. And it’s not surprising.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Devil Baby has been terrifying New York shoppers

Passers-by are lured to the stroller by the sound of a baby crying

The producers made a remote-controlled stroller containing a horrifying animatronic ‘devil baby’ that suddenly sits up and emits a demonic, blood-curdling wail when approached.

Passers-by are lured to the stroller by the sound of a baby crying. Then, when they’re close, the Satanic occupant gives them the shock of their lives.

It even vomits and makes rude hand gestures.

Devil Baby has no respect for New York's finest

The devilish prank gave New Yorkers the fright of their lives

The YouTube video for the prank has received nearly three million views

Everyone that the prank targets - filmed by hidden cameras - seems genuinely frightened.

However, one person in the video, which has been viewed nearly three million times, remains bafflingly unruffled by ‘devil baby’.

He’s clearly made of tougher stuff.

Even the local wildlife is subjected to the wrath of 'devil baby'

Devil's Due, out on January 17, stars Allison Miller, Zach Gilford and Sam Anderson and is directed by Eli Roth.

Roth described the film as 'smart, creative, inventive, and fun' and 'very very scary'.

But possibly not as scary as the PR stunt for it.
