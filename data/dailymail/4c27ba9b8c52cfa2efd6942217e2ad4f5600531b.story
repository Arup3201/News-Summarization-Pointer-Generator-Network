A Malaysian boy aged six has been accused of raping his five-year-old cousin in a case believed to be the one of the first of its kind in the world.

Doctors discovered she had been sexually penetrated after a medical check-up - and despite initial scepticism a consultant urologist at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital said it was possible for a child that young to have an erection.

The extraordinary case came to light after the children's grandmother found them naked and playing 'mothers and fathers' at the family home in the town of Pendang, Kedah - a rural area covered with paddy fields

The girl's 32 year old mother, a medical assistant, then lodged a report on New Year's Day, Malaysia's Star newspaper reported.

But the paper said that the following day the mother told police she was not keen to pursue the case and had only reported it so her daughter could be checked at a hospital.

The doctor who examined the girl and 
found a minor tear in the hymen alerted the Malacca Action Group for 
Parents in Education.

Chairman Mak Chee Hin said: 'It is shocking that young children are capable of such acts.

'Blame should be levelled at the adults who do not give guidance and care to the children.'

He added that a full medical report would determine whether the six year old boy is the youngest predator in the country.

The case comes just weeks after a 
boy of 11 allegedly raped a six-year-old girl at a 
babysitter’s home in Alor Gajah.

The
 consultant urologist, who asked not to be 
named, told The Star that that it was possible for a boy of that age to 
have an erection, although such occurrences were more common among 
Caucasian children.

Sexual development began from a child's first year, he said, pointing out that some baby boys were even born with erections.

He added: 'In Western countries, medical reports suggest that young boys and girls can experience orgasm although boys will not be able to ejaculate until puberty.

'For Asian children, it is very rare, although there have been rare cases that are mostly attributed to surroundings and upbringing.'

This case, he added, could have happened due to exposure to pornographic materials.

'It could be due to witnessing an adult performing an intimate act or watching pornographic videos, said the urologist.

“Even if the child had an erection, it would have only lasted for a while and not to the extent of penetration.
