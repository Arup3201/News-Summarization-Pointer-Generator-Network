Love or hate Fifty Shades Of Grey, the release of the movie this week appears to be the perfect excuse to try a sexy new drink. Or, to be more precise, to get the object of your affections to try a sexy new drink.

Booze is surely already one of the biggest turn-ons there is (there's not much I won't do after a night on top shelf tequila). 

But the film seems to have inspired the nation's bartenders and drinks connoisseurs to get extra frisky: muddling, shaking, stirring and pouring their hearts into spicy new serves brimming with aphrodisiacs just in time to celebrate Valentine's weekend. 

Fifty Shades Of Grey appears to be the perfect excuse to try a sexy new drink

Who needs Viagra when you can drink a Watermelon Margarita (the melon is known to relax blood vessels and improve circulation)? 

Did you know that adding a dash of chilli to your date's cocktail could result in a rather fabulous hot flush (for both of you)? 

And I've even found a health-giving 'tantric' smoothie recipe for the morning after to kick things off again.

WATERMELON MARTINI by ao.com

Watermelon is known as the 'lycopene king' and said to have a Viagra-like effect on the body, as it relaxes blood vessels and improves circulation.

Ingredients:

½ medium watermelon, seeds removed

Juice of 1 lemon

Juice of 1 lime

2-3 tbsp icing sugar (or to taste)

120 ml Tequila

60ml Triple Sec (or Grand Marnier)

2 tbsp coarse salt for rimming glasses

Crushed ice to serve

Small slices of watermelon to garnish (optional)

Watermelon Margarita: Said to have a viagra-like effect on the body

Method:

Cube the watermelon and remove any seeds. Blend in a food processor until liquidized. Strain the juice through a fine sieve into a large jug, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract as much juice as possible.

Add the icing sugar, lemon and lime juice and stir. Add a handful of ice, the tequila and Triple Sec and stir.

Put the salt into a shallow dish. Rub a lime around the rim of your glasses and dip them into the salt.

Half fill the glasses with crushed ice and carefully divide the Margarita among the glasses. Garnish with a small slice of watermelon.

Frozen Watermelon Margarita

If you own a powerful blender then blend the margarita mix with a couple of handfuls of ice to create a frozen version.

For an even better frozen margarita, freeze the watermelon juice until solid (before you add any alcohol) then blend in a food processor together with the Tequila, Triple Sec and citrus juices.

FIFTY SHADES SHOP at Ocado

Planning on staying in? Ocado has plumbed the Fifty Shades trilogy (tough gig) to offer a selection of the drinks Christian Grey enjoys, including a few fizz-based options sure to impress... 

Try the Ocado Fifty Shades shop or the red wine and Bloody Marys at Harvey Nichols

RED WINE AND BLOODY MARYS at Harvey Nichols

Department store Harvey Nichols aren't leaving anything to chance this Valentine's Day with every aspect of their V day dinner menu designed to titillate.

Their love experts have identified what scents and tastes gets us in the mood (the smell of vanilla for men, red wine for women) and will be serving them up alongside more classic aphrodisiacs like oysters (twice as effective when paired with a Bloody Mary) and chocolate at their cafes and restaurants this weekend.

Two drinks that the 'dine-ology' experts recommend this weekend:

1. Red Wine: Contains resveratrol, the antioxidant known to boost endorphins and encourage flirtatious talk, particularly among women who drink less than two glasses of wine a day.

2. A Bloody Mary with Oysters: Due to their zinc content oysters crank up the production of testosterone and serve as an aphrodisiac and pairing with a Bloody Mary, because of its rich tomato content, can improve blood flow and increase sex drive even further. Bloody Marys, being the colour of love and passion are even known to both enhance a man's attractiveness and make men feel more amorous toward women.

The Valentine's Day menu is served in Harvey Nichols Cafés: £35 per person Includes a three course menu and Valentine's Cocktail, served from 6pm - 11pm

The Valentine's Day menu is served in Harvey Nichols Restaurant: £100 per couple includes a three course meal and glass of Champagne each from 6.30pm - 11pm
