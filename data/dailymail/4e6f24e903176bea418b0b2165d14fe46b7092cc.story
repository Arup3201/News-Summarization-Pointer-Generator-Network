Hull owner Assem Allam has warned he will stop 'throwing money' at the club if he cannot force through his controversial 'Tigers' rebrand.

Allam has been bankrolling Hull since saving the club from financial calamity in 2010, and has invested upwards of £70million in the team since then.

He believes the only route to sustainability lies in changing the official name from Hull City AFC to Hull Tigers, a move he thinks would lead to sizeable overseas investment.

Despite the Football Association Council throwing out his proposal in April, Allam backed manager Steve Bruce's rebuilding plans this summer with over £30million of transfer funds.

But the 75-year-old Egyptian, who is engaged in arbitration with the FA over its decision and has also put the club up for sale, insists there will be no more spending unless he gets his way.

'That [the money] stops now. It has to stop,' Allam told BBC's Football Focus.

'I won't pay out if I cannot create income. That is called 'throwing money at it'.'

'I won't throw money at a problem. I want to deal with the problem.'

Allam's latest intervention cannot have been welcomed by Bruce, who has done his level best to play peacemaker in an increasingly bitter stand-off between the owner and sections of the fan base for over a year now.

Hull have struggled on the pitch this season and haven't won in the Premier League since the opening day

That his words come on the eve of a home match against Crystal Palace, meanwhile, represents an unwelcome case of deja vu.

It was the corresponding fixture last season when protests against the name change plan reached fever pitch, with supporter demonstrations proving an unwanted distraction as Hull slipped to their first home defeat.

The atmosphere at the KC Stadium has been on a knife edge at times this term, with chants of 'City Till We Die' now booed by rival elements of the crowd.

Allam took over in 2010 and has since helped them get into the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final

What awaits in the stands on Saturday, when Bruce's main priority is a first win since the opening day of the season, is now an open question.

But the manager was pragmatic when asked to comment on Allam's position ahead of the match.

Bruce noted that no further spending was now possible until January but insisted he would not be shy about requesting funds when the time comes.

Hull manager Steve Bruce has had to act as a peacemaker between Allam and angry supporters 

'The window's finished and I'm sure he (Allam) is delighted, but it's my job to knock the door and want better and if I'm not doing that I'm not doing my job right,' he said.

'I will always, always ask the question. Of course it's not a bottomless pit, we understand that, and I have to say the chairman and the owners have assembled a wonderful squad together here.

'We can't argue or grumble about what we've been able to put together. So I wont be mithering him now but then the window doesn't open for another three months. I'll have a little nibble then.'
