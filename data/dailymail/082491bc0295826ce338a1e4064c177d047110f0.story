The 'nanny from hell' who refused to move out of a California family's home despite doing no work has hit back at her former employers saying they once tried to feed her dog food.

Diane Stretton, 64, spoke out for the first time after it emerged she told the Bracamonte family she could be out of their Upland home as long as her long list of conditions were kept.

The alarming demands include providing her air-conditioning and hand soap at all times, vacating the property between the hours of 8am and 5pm and giving her access to healthy meals - or cough up $200 so that she can go out for a meal.

But Stretton has now claimed in an interview that it was the family who were being demanding as they worked her as many as 10 hours a day without any lunch or coffee breaks.

Battle: Diane Stretton, pictured helping bake a cake for the Bracamonte's son in March, has denied she was lazy after moving into their home and simply said they overworked her

'There wasn’t a single day I was there, except for the two days I was sick, that I didn’t do dishes and about two or three hours of cleanup,' Stretton told KTLA in her first interview.

She called Marcella Bracamonte a 'drama queen' and 'Screaming Mimi' who spent most of her day on the phone 'just like a teenager' and who wanted her to work harder than her board was worth.

Mrs Bracamonte has previously said that her three children, aged 11, four and one, initially loved Stretton but after three weeks, she refused to help them and claimed she had health problems.

After sending her warning letters asking her to improve, the family eventually told Stretton that she needed to leave and within 12 hours, her cable, air conditioning and internet access were cut off.

But she claimed that it didn't stop there - because the family tried to feed her dog food.

Family: Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte hired Stretton through Craigslist to look after their 3 young children

Diane Stretton's letter to the family reads:

'Agreement: I will voluntarily agree to leave by 6pm on 7/6/14 if each and all of the following conditions are met:

1.
 My WiFi and TV and house air conditioning and water must be continuously
 on until I vacate. Electricity in my room must be operational.

2. Bathrooms must be stocked up with TP (toilet paper) and hand soap at all times.

3.
 Marcella and kids must vacate the premises between the hours of 8am and
 5pm until 7/6/14 whether I elect to leave during the day or not.

4. 
Between the hours of 5pm and 8am, I have full access to my room, the 
garage bathroom and the areas of the house between the front door and my
 bedroom. I will not linger in these areas.

5. I'm either given 
access to healthy food or given $200 to eat out. Said access to food 
shall be limited to hours between 8am and 5pm.

6. Neither the front 
door nor my bedroom shall be locked in a manner than prevents me from 
entering. This means the chain must be off and the locks cannot be 
changed.

In exchanged [sic] for the above, I will agree not to seek any of my legal remedies for your past violations of our agreement.'

'Right after she served that letter, she gave the kids three cans of dog food and told them to put it outside my room for my food,' she said. 'And so little Ralphie, four-years-old, knocks on the door and says, "Diane, your dinner's here, we got dog food for you".'

She said that she had planned to move out in 30 days, but the situation 'got complicated'.

But she now could be out of the house by the weekend - as long as certain conditions were met.

A letter Stretton sent to the Bracamontes and seen by MailOnline shows her demands, including that she has access to amenities, healthy food and a well-stocked bathroom.

'Marcella and kids must vacate the premises between the hours of 8am and
 5pm until 7/6/14 whether I elect to leave during the day or not,' one of the demands reads.

'I'm either given 
access to healthy food or given $200 to eat out,' she wrote in another. 'Bathrooms must be stocked up with TP (toilet paper) and hand soap at all times.'

The list says, if the conditions are met, she will voluntarily leave on July 6 and will not seek any of the legal remedies for 'your past violations of our agreement'.

Police had
 previously said they could not kick Stretton out of the home because 
they had willingly invited her into their home and she had established 
residency. If they wanted to get rid of her, they had to evict her, they
 said.

The Bracamontes were also not impressed with this latest correspondence from Stretton.

'She wrote it to get me really upset, to get me furious and she did get me furious, but I didn’t respond to her,' Mrs Bracamonte told MailOnline.

'She's
 playing games. She knows I have a very short temper and she's trying to
 wind me up. She's not going to do it because I know her game - I'm not 
going to get wound up.'

The nanny has cited the weather, the media and physical disabilities as the
 reasons she hasn't moved out of her former employers' home, but said 
she will be out this week.

In an email sent this weekend to the Bracamontes' lawyer, Stretton said she tried to move out of 
the house but there was 'always a bunch of news vehicles right in front 
of the house. The media needs to be completely gone before I continue 
moving.'

Stretton disappeared from the 
Bracamontes' house last Thursday morning and was later discovered in her car 
outside of a police station on Friday.

Asked if she's relieved Stretton has now said she will leave, Marcella said: 'I'm relieved and then not.'

'I'm 
relieved because the past few days she hasn’t been here,' she said. 'But
 then that also scares me because I don’t know when she’s coming.

'Say I want to go to the grocery store and then she comes, what is she going to do to the house? What if she comes and burns my house down. What if she comes in the middle of the night when I’m sleeping.'

Marcella and her husband Ralph are heading to her 
sister’s wedding in Mexico on Wednesday and have arranged for members of her husband’s family to move in to guard the house.

She said: 'I have to go, it’s my sister’s
 wedding and I’m maid of honor and this woman has stolen enough from us,
 stole enough piece of mind, time, energy, heartache, crying, tears, 
she’s not going to take my sister’s wedding away from me.'

Hiding out: Last week she was seen sleeping in her car - but the family lives in fear she will return

The saga began in March when Stretton responded to the family's Craiglist ad for someone to help around the house and watch the children in exchange for meals and a room.

A few weeks into being hired, she revealed that she suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a breathing condition, and all but gave up on work.

Since the story has made headlines, it has emerged that this is not Stretton's first experience with litigation, She is even listed on California's Vexatious Litigant List, 
which includes those who bring legal action that is 
frivolous or repetitive.

The majority of the lawsuits were 
directed at her own family members, particularly her two sisters, and last year she even attempted to sue her son.
