Former Florida Gov Jeb Bush likened the media to 'crack and heroin addicts' in an awkward rant when asked on Sunday about whether or not he would seek to run for president in 2016.

It was the end of a busy week of public appearances for Bush - including five on Sunday alone - as he plugs his new book, Immigration Wars.

On NBC's 'Meet the Press,' the strain of the book tour appeared to be getting to him when he was asked by host David Gregory about the prospect of following in his father and brother's footsteps.

Gregory asked: 'Who's the hottest Florida politician right now? Is it you or Marco Rubio? Who are we more likely to see in the White House?'

In response, Bush said: 'Man, you guys are crack addicts. You really are obsessed with all this politics.'

The 'Meet the Press' host interrupted, saying he'd been called a lot of things, but never a crack addict.

'OK, heroin addict. Is that better?' Bush shot back.

Bush is one of a handful of potential Republican contenders in the public eye in recent months, a list that also includes Rubio, of Florida, Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie.

'We've got big challenges, and Marco 
Rubio, to his credit, is working on those. And he deserves a lot of 
credit for it, and I'm very proud of him,' Jeb Bush said of his 
potential rival.

After Bush left the Florida governor's office in 2007, some urged him to jump into the 2012 race against President Barack Obama.

But his brother's low approval ratings could have dragged him down, and there seemed little interest in a national campaign.

But with Republicans looking for a new message and messenger, Jeb Bush is signaling he's open to the possibility.

'I'm not saying yes. I'm just not saying no,' Bush told NBC News last week.

Speaking to CNN's State of the Union, Bush said it is too early to seriously ponder a bid for the White House.

'When you asked me before 2012 - Was I 
going to run in 2012? - and I said no, I went through the process and 
decided it wasn't appropriate.'

'I've decided to defer any 
consideration of it until the proper time ... which is out more than a 
year from now, for sure... When I go through that process, I'll let you know.'

Bush's book tour has sparked a 
torrent of speculation about his political future, but he has shrugged 
off questions about his plans without definitively ruling out a 
presidential bid.

'I'm not viewing this as a political re-entry,' he told ABC's 'This Week' of the media tour for his book.

Bush has come under fire for appearing to backtrack on his support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.

A passage in his book proposes a path to legal residency for undocumented immigrants but tough conditions for citizenship.

'I haven't changed,' he said on CBS's Face the Nation. 'I support a path to legalization or citizenship so long as the path for people that have been waiting patiently is easier and costs less - the legal entrance to our country - than illegal entrance.'

Republicans have become more favorable to the idea of a path to citizenship since losing the Hispanic vote by a big margin in November, and Bush said he backs bipartisan Senate efforts to develop a comprehensive immigration plan led by a group including Rubio.

Bush invoked a rant by Bill Murray in the 1984 film Ghostbusters when he said: 'This is a very encouraging time, because if we can get immigration right, imagine, there's possibilities of cats and dogs living with one another in other policy areas as well.'

While Bush's father and brother were both presidents, he said he did not believe he would carry any 'Bush baggage' into a possible presidential bid.

He said his brother George's unpopular 2001-2009 tenure in the White House will eventually be viewed more favorably.

'I love my brother. I'm proud of his accomplishments. I love my dad, I'm proud to be a Bush and if I run for president it is not because of something in my DNA that compels me to do it,' he said on 'Fox News Sunday.'
