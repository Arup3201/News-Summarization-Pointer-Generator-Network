Ulrika Jonsson has spoken out after Sven Goran Eriksson confirmed their affair in his autobiography

Sven-Goran Eriksson boasted he would be able to beat Sir Alex Ferguson in a fight because he could run faster, his former lover Ulrika Jonsson has claimed.

Miss Jonsson, 46, said the former England manager hated Ferguson and the pair were 'constantly having explosive rows'.

The TV presenter, who had a four-month affair with Eriksson, has also said making love with the Swede was as dull as putting together Ikea flat-pack furniture.

Speaking to The Sun, Miss Jonsson said Eriksson once contacted her while she was at her mother's when he told her about an argument over the Manchester United manager allowing him to take David Beckham and Wayne Rooney for an England game.

She said: 'He said to me, "If it came down to a fight with Alex Ferguson, I'd beat him".

'I asked why. He said, "Because I'm a faster runner". He thought that was funny. To me it's the words of a coward.'

Miss Jonsson also said Eriksson often moaned his £4million England job was boring as they were only playing one game a month.

She described making love with Eriksson as 'devoid of passion' but said her fellow Swede loved to ‘talk dirty’ in broken English when they were in bed together.

Speaking in response to Mr Eriksson's 
tell-all book, serialised in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, Miss 
Jonsson said Eriksson lived in fear of his ‘feisty fruitcake’ girlfriend
Nancy Dell’olio who slapped him when their secret affair was exposed.

But she claimed the Italian should be grateful for the scandal because it made her famous.

Miss Jonsson’s affair with Eriksson began in January 2002, a month after they first met at a party.

Eriksson acknowledged his affair with Miss Jonsson for the first time in our excerpts from his autobiography.

He revealed that it started when they met for the second time at a function in Manchester.

He
wrote: ‘I was there with some people from the FA. For some reason, 
Ulrika was also invited. We met at the hotel the evening before and 
ended up spending the night together.

‘After that, Ulrika and I met when we could. Not daily, but now and then. It got to be more and more serious.

‘Nancy
did not suspect anything. She was travelling to Italy a lot during that
time. Once, Ulrika and I went to Portugal for a few days. Mostly we met
at her house outside London.’

Mr
Goran Eriksson said that that his then girlfriend Nancy Dell'Olio 
regarded Miss Jonsson as 'little more than a prostitute' in an extract 
from his book serialised by the Daily Mail this week

He said Miss Dell’Olio was livid when she found out about the secret relationship when it was revealed by a Sunday newspaper.

‘To Nancy, Ulrika was little more than a prostitute who was not worthy of being on the same planet as Miss Dell’Olio,’ he wrote.

‘Nancy’s mother called from Italy. She had read the story online — Italy was an hour ahead of England.

‘Nancy was livid, she said: “Was it true?” I said it was nothing to worry or get upset about, or something to that effect.’

Mr
Eriksson, now a football coach in China, said he did not feel he had 
anything to apologise for and claimed he received a positive reaction 
from the public.

‘I got
a lot of “thumbs up” from young men who laughed and said they wished it
had been them getting together with a beautiful woman like Ulrika.'
