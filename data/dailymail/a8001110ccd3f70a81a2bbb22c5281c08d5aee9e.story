Long suffering victims of hayfever may soon be breathing a sign of relief after it was revealed trials are under-way to inject trees with hormones to reduce allergens. 

Melbourne City Council are carrying out the tests on 18 London Plane trees in the busy cafe area of Lygon Street for the second year running. 

Last year hormones were injected into the trunks of the trees but it didn't seem to make any difference.  

The London Plane trees are causing problems for customers wanting to stop for a coffee in Lygon Street 

About three quarters of Melbourne's trees are London Planes and the council is now carrying out tests to try and reduce their allergins

These are the seed pods the council hope the hormones will help stop to produce 

Now the hormones have been injected into the tree soil and sprayed over the canopy. 

Traders have welcomed the move and said 'something has to be done' because the pollen problem is getting worse. 

It is hoped the hormone injections will stop the trees from producing seed pods, which are often blamed for causing nasal, throat and eye irritations for annoyed customers.  

Customers of coffee shops in Lygon Street have long complained of the pollen in Lygon Street 

Traders have welcomed the move and said 'something has to be done' because the pollen problem is getting worse

Marco Riggio, manager of Grinders Coffee in Lygon Street, says he suffers very badly from hayfever and would welcome any solution to the problem. 

The 30-year-old told Daily Mail Australia: 'The pollen problem is really bad round here and lots of customers who don't sit down in the seated areas because the pollen is just everywhere.

'I have seen customers sneezing outside and lots of them relate it back to the trees.   

Robert Doyle, Melbourne Lord Mayor said: 'It's a well known technique for orchardists and nut farmers to control the blossoming and flowering and the seeding of their trees'  

Last year Melbourne City Council trialled injecting the hormones into the tree trunks but it didn't work 

'There isn't a day that goes by that me and my staff have not sneezed ten times in the morning because of the pollen.

'It is because of the type of trees down here that is it so bad. 

'I have got really bad sinus problems and would welcome anything to try and solve it.'  

The council is now trying to inject the hormones into the soil and spray it over the canopy of the trees 

Traders say the trial is 'long overdue' and the problem is just 'getting worse' 

Mr Riggio said he often joked about the pollen problem with the manager of neighbouring coffee shop Cafe Lobello.

He said: 'The owner often says it's a problem and it is annoying for him because he has sit down customers outside.' 

Paul Ferraro, 45, one of the partners in University Cafe which has 56 outdoor seats for customers said: 'The pollen gets on the seats, sugars, in the coffee and it even gets stuck in your throat. 

'This was the wrong choice of trees for this area. I think the trial is a fantastic idea because some people can't breathe, it is a serious problem. 

'The pollen is pretty bad from the middle of September to the end of November. 

'I am very glad because it is long due, the pollen wasn't bad when the trees were babies but it is getting worse.' 

Robert Doyle, Melbourne Lord Mayor, told 9News: 'It's a well known technique for orchardists and nut farmers to control the blossoming and flowering and the seeding of their trees. 

'We can't spray ours from overhead like they can but we are going to experiment to see if we can without harming trees reduce the amount of seed debris.' 

Melbourne City Council's landscape manager, Ian Shears, told 774 ABC Melbourne: 'If you look around the [CBD] around 75 percent of the trees are London planes, and Lygon Street in the cafe strip in particular is where probably most of the concerns from the community come from. 

'They want to enjoy their cappuccinos just with milk froth rather than anything else on top of it, I think.'
