Formula 1 mogul Eddie Jordan, TOWIE star Amy Childs and Strictly Come Dancing's Kristina Rihanoff were among the celebrities in attendance at Royal Ascot today.

The trio joined thousands of punters who descended upon the second day of the glamorous racing event in Berkshire.

While Amy spent the early part of the day getting stuck into champagne, Kristina was kicked out for not adhering to the event's strict dress code.

Her blue dress, which was made entirely out of Coral betting slips, was deemed unsuitable and have have even been a publicity stunt.

A few hours later the blonde beauty reappeared wearing a massive grin and a more demure grey dress and dark blazer.

Yesterday's opening race saw Toronado cruise to victory in the Queen Anne Stakes.

However the day's big winner was Kingman, ridden by James Doyle, in the St James' Palace Stakes.
