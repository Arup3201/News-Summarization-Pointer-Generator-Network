'There is a lot of good stuff happening in the economy. But what we all know is there are still some challenges,' he said.

The couple, who have two daughters, Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, began dating after meeting at Sidley Austin in June 1989 and were engaged by 1991.

Their relationship has been subject to great public scrutiny, with a number of books claiming that the couple came close to splitting in their early years together.

In one, Mrs Obama is said to have even drawn up divorce papers after deciding her husband's burning political ambition was ruining their chances of domestic happiness.

In 2009, veteran Washington reporter Richard Wolffe claimed that the marriage almost collapsed nine years earlier because of Obama’s political drive and the family’s shattered finances. 

And earlier this year, under the headline 'Obama Divorce Bombshell!', the National Enquirer claimed the Obamas' marriage had dissolved in a string of ugly fights.

It said the disagreements were partly prompted by Obama taking a 'selfie' with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's memorial.

It added that Mrs Obama was sleeping in a separate bedroom from her husband and only standing by him until his presidency ends.

Obama will then return to his home state of Hawaii, while she will remain with their daughters in Washington, it reported. 

However, the National Inquirer quoted only anonymous insiders in support of the sensational claims, which the White House refused to comment on.
