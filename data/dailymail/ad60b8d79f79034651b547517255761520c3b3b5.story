Finals fan: Former Wasps and England star, now BT Sport pundit, Laurence Dallaglio enjoyed the back-end of the season as a player

Lawrence Dallaglio adores May’s league
 play-offs. Better weather. Faster tracks. Bigger crowds. Trophies on 
offer. A chance to upset the odds.

In
 his pomp as the English back rower everyone loved to hate, his Wasps 
side became masters in timing their run from the pack to peak at just 
the right moment.

Three 
years in succession they finished second in the pecking order but when 
the Premiership trophy was handed out at Twickenham a few weeks later, 
the roles were reversed. Gloucester, Bath and Leicester, teams that 
finished ahead of Wasps in the regular season, were all swatted aside in
 consecutive showpiece deciders from 2003 to 2005.

It’s
 a trend not confined to England. Topping the PRO12 table and securing 
the No 1 seeding for the play-offs has been no precursor to 
end-of-season glory. Just once in the four seasons so far since doing 
away with the first-past-the-post system has the No 1 team lifted the 
trophy.

Leinster have suffered twice, losing 
finals after leading the way into May, and they are now in that 
dangerous position again having topped the pile with no guarantee of a 
title. 

‘It’s 
exciting,’ enthuses Dallaglio. ‘The play-offs are here to stay now. 
Obviously, I enjoyed the concept [as a player] because we didn’t moan 
about them when they were introduced, we just got on and made sure we 
were well placed to win.

Last hurrah: Brian O'Driscoll could play his last game in the Pro12 semi-final against Ulster on Saturday

‘When
 you have international rugby that is played at the same time as club 
rugby and your best players, your international players, are taken away 
from you for a third of the season then to have a first-past-the-post 
situation is not really appropriate.

‘The
 play-offs are fair and equitable. It allows you to continue to produce 
players for international rugby without a club being penalised for them 
being taken away from you.’

The
 concept isn’t completely perfect, though. As someone who prided himself
 on being the best player he could be for his country, he believes it’s 
unfair that Test rugby has been pencilled in across the southern 
hemisphere on June 7 just a week after the finals in the various 
European leagues.

‘Maybe
 in another year we might get some common sense and the people who are 
planning things might plan things a little bit better,’ he says, 
dissatisfied that England, Ireland and France will all have very little 
time to prepare for their summer tours.

Fairytale: Dallaglio says it would be brave to bet against O'Driscoll enjoying the perfect finale

The Premiership is where Dallaglio 
still earns a crust, swopping his boots for the BT Sport mic. He was 
rostered in for Friday night’s semi-final between Northampton and 
Leicester (won 21-20 by Saints) but will be keeping an eye on the PRO12, particularly to see 
whether Brian O’Driscoll leaves Leinster behind the same way he did 
Ireland - with a trophy in his hand.

Dallaglio
 was the boogie man who inspired Wasps to ruin Martin Johnson’s going 
away party in 2005, going on at the time about how all the talk about 
the World Cup winning skipper retiring wound up the Londoners’ dressing
 room. The sense of mischief should naturally be similar in the Ulster 
dressing room.

As much 
as they respect O’Driscoll they will want to send him into retirement on
 a bum note, but Dallaglio believes there is no reason why the Irish 
legend can’t go out on a high. ‘When you have players of the stature of 
Martin Johnson and Brian O’Driscoll, then naturally there is going to be
 a huge amount written, quite rightly, about their success and the 
build-up to the fairytale ending.

‘Brian
 O’Driscoll will want to have a say in that as well and being the 
quality player he is there is no reason why the best players in the 
world can’t go out winning trophies… it would take a tough man to back 
against him.’

Retired 
himself since 2008, Dallaglio, an England World Cup 2015 ambassador, was
 in Limerick on Thursday to co-present with Keith Wood at the first 
European Sports Tourism summit.

While there he admits he detected a 
sense of hunger for Ireland to dream aloud and pitch for the 2023 World 
Cup. Having been involved in England’s operation, he suggests there is 
no obstacle to a competitive bid. 

‘There
 is no reason why Ireland can’t put together a very credible and strong 
bid that would require the collaboration of the whole country. I know it
 has been talked about and I’m sure it will continue to be something to 
be talked about and will gather more momentum and pace.

‘There seems to 
be a huge appetite to take a potential bid to the next stage. There 
needs to be a lot of agreement and discussion, and it will also need to 
involve various stakeholders which is the Irish government, the various 
cities that could potentially host the tournament and the different 
sports as well like soccer and GAA.

‘Clearly,
 in the same way in England the rugby community couldn’t host a 
tournament of this size on its own, I’m sure Ireland would agree that 
they would probably need to reach out to everyone in the country.

‘There’s
 lots of learning and sharing, isn’t there? The World Cup is the third 
biggest sports event on the planet and it’s quite hard to believe it’s 
now less than 500 days to go.’

Former England skipper 
Lawrence Dallaglio believes there is no greater sport than rugby to help
 disadvantaged kids get their lives back on track.

His
 Dallaglio Foundation has raised £7million for a variety of charities 
since 2009 and he’s especially inspired that the opportunity he provides
 to play rugby has been snapped up by numerous teenagers.

‘Rugby
 was a big part of my life and I feel very strongly we have a duty and 
responsibility to give back. Setting up the foundation allows me to 
channel that energy into something I feel very passionate about.

‘I
 run a rugby programme that goes all over the UK and delivers rugby to 
kids that have even been excluded or expelled from school. The values 
around the game have got the ability to help those types of young people
 turn their lives around,’ he said.

‘They
 can benefit from the support system which the values of the game 
provides. Rugby is about collective responsibility and doing things 
together. The difference between young kids who are successful and get 
on in life tend to be the support they receive, not just from their 
parents but from the wider community.

'Rugby
 certainly gave me a direction and focus in my life. I’m not talking 
about all these kids becoming Test rugby players but what it does is it 
builds up their confidence, builds up their self-esteem.’
