It roamed the countryside spreading death and terror – a giant, ferocious hell-hound with flaming eyes and savage claws.

For centuries, the beast that came to be known as Black Shuck struck fear into the hearts of all who crossed its path.

Just a single glimpse was enough to impart a fatal curse; the briefest encounter sufficient to suck the life from any hapless victim.

Discovery: These remains of a giant dog were found during a dig among the ruins of Leiston Abbey in Suffolk

Is it him? The bones are believed to date back to the 16th century, when the legendary hell hound Black Shuck (pictured in an artist's impression) was rumoured to roam East Anglia. They show the dog was a 'large male'

One thing, however, has always been 
absent from the many tales of the dog-like entity and its sinister 
appearances in the East of England flatlands: A single fact.

Now that may be about to change with an answer to the question: Did it exist only in folklore ... or was it flesh and blood?

Yesterday,
 500 years after Black Shuck first went on the prowl, archaeologists 
were examining the skeleton of a 7ft long dog unearthed in the remains 
of an ancient abbey.

It was 
discovered a few miles from two churches where Black Shuck is said to 
have killed worshippers during an almighty thunderstorm in August 1577.

What’s
 more, it appears to have been buried in a shallow grave at precisely 
the same time as Shuck is said to have been on the loose, primarily 
around Suffolk and the East Anglia region.

Site: The bones were uncovered in a 20-inch deep unmarked grave among the ruins of Leiston Abbey (pictured)

Experts will subject the bones and surrounding material to 21st century dating techniques.

But
 first, the legend. The beast’s most celebrated attack began at Holy 
Trinity church, Blythburgh. A clap of thunder burst open the church 
doors and a hairy black ‘devil dog’ came snarling in.

It
 ran through the congregation, killing a man and boy and causing the 
church steeple to fall through the roof. Scorch marks still visible on 
the church doors are purported to have come from Shuck’s claws as it 
fled.

Local verse records 
the event thus: ‘All down the church in the midst of fire, the hellish 
monster flew, and, passing onward to the quire, he many people slew.’

Next
 stop was 12 miles away in Bungay, where two worshippers were killed at 
St Mary’s church. One was left shrivelled ‘like a drawn purse’ as he 
prayed.

Brendon Wilkins, projects director of Dig Ventures, which organised the dig, pictured, said he believed the dog could have lived around 1577 because it was buried alongside pottery fragments from the period

Ruins: Dig Ventures projects director, Brendon Wilkins, said the grave was dug partly over the foundations of what appeared to have been a kitchen area - indicating it had been created after the abbey fell into disrepair

In his 1577 pamphlet
 A Straunge And Terrible Wunder, the Rev Abraham Fleming told how the 
Satan-like beast came ‘running all along down the body of the church 
with great swiftnesse and incredible haste, among the  people, in a 
visible fourm and shape’, wringing the necks of two parishioners as they
 knelt.

Spookily, a later work reveals: ‘Although his howling makes the hearer’s blood run cold, his footfalls make no sound.’

Subsequent
 appearances of Shuck – a name believed to derive either from an old 
English word for demon, or from local dialect meaning ‘shaggy’ – have 
immortalised it.

An image of Black Shuck is incorporated in Bungay’s 
coat of arms, and the nickname for equally legendary Bungay Town FC is 
the Black Dogs.

The bones of the giant dog were found during a dig among the ruins of Leiston Abbey in Suffolk

The bones 
uncovered in the ruins of Leiston Abbey, Suffolk, were first found by 
archaeological group Dig Ventures in a project last year.

Painstaking
 work revealed the skeleton of an extremely large dog.

Estimates suggest
 it would have weighed more than 14 stone and stood 7ft tall on its hind
 legs.

The grave was less than 20 inches deep and unmarked. Pottery 
fragments found at the same level date from the height of Shuck’s 
alleged reign.

Radio carbon 
dating tests will now give an exact age for the bones, results that will
 serve either to enhance the shaggy dog stories – or perhaps to support 
the far less entertaining theory that here lies a 16th century abbot’s 
beloved old hunting dog.

Folklore: The legend of Black Shuck is now so popular that images of the dog have been put up across Bungay. Above, a weather vane in the town

According to folklore, Black Shuck appeared during a storm on August 4, 1577, at Holy Trinity Church in Blythburgh, about seven miles from Leiston in Suffolk.

Villagers were reportedly sheltering inside the church when a huge clap of thunder caused the doors to burst open and the snarling dog crashed in.

It ran through the congregation, killing a man and a boy, before the steeple crashed through the roof.

The dog then fled, leaving scorch marks from its claws on the church door which are still visible today.

Later the same day, Black Shuck is said to have struck again 12 miles away, killing two worshippers during a service at St Mary’s Church, Bungay, while the storm was still raging.

Clergyman,
 the Rev Abraham Fleming, is believed to have described the appearance of the legendary hell hound in a pamphlet written in 1577, entitled ‘A Straunge and 
Terrible Wunder’.

He wrote: 'This black dog, or the divel in such a 
linenesse (God hee knoweth al who worketh all,) running all along down 
the body of the church with great swiftnesse, and incredible haste, 
among the people, in a visible fourm and shape, passed between two 
persons, as they were kneeling uppon their knees, and occupied in prayer
 as it seemed, wrung the necks of them bothe at one instant clene 
backward, in somuch that even at a moment where they kneeled, they 
strangely dyed.'

Historian W. A. Dutt also wrote about Black Shuck in his 1901 book, Highways and Byways, set in East Anglia.

'He takes the form of a huge black dog, and prowls along dark 
lanes and lonesome field footpaths, where, although his howling makes 
the hearer’s blood run cold, his footfalls make no sound,' he wrote.

The legend of Black Shuck is now so popular that images of the dog have been put up in buildings across the town - and the animal is even being 
incorporated into Bungay’s coat of arms.

There is also a Black Dog Running 
Club and a Black Dog antiques shop, while the nickname for the town's football club is 'The Black Dogs'.

And the legend has even infiltrated popular culture - with British rock band The Darkness featuring a track inspired by the devil dog on their debut album, Permission To Land.

The track, named 'Black Shuck', includes the lyrics: 'In a town in the east, the parishioners were visited upon by a curious beast.

'And his eyes numbered but one and shone like the sun, and a glance beckoned the immediate loss of a cherished one.'
