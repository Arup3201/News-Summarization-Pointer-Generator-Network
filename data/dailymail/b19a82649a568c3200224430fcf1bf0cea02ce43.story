Garish bedclothes have been revealed in a shortlist of the world's worst hotel bed linen compiled by a travel website.

The clashing hues of red, blue and orange are often paired with questionable carpet choices and flashy fixtures and fittings leaving travellers dazzled.

Chintzy flower patterns and seventies-inspired artwork are included in the 'top 10' of worst interior design. 

Chintzy: This flowery bedspread stands out a mile in the otherwise bland room

Where to start? The curtains, mismatched cushions and artwork pale into comparison next to the bed linen

Sea view: The only thing that saves this room is the sunny view

Garish: The brightly-coloured bedspreads are made worse by the addition of fake flowers

The travel blog, on Top10.com, holds up shining examples of how not to decorate rooms to give your guests a peaceful night's sleep.

Favourites include a bed bizarrely decorated with two clashing patterns, fake flowers above the bed and stomach-churning colours.

One room is marginally improved by a sea view but even that can't completely distract from the mismatched shades on the sheets and curtains.

Alex Buttle, co-founder of hotel price comparison website Top10.com, said: 'From Manchester to Mecca, Lisbon to Las Vegas, itâ€™s clear that garish colours and bizarre patterns abound globally in the mysterious world of hotel bedlinen.

Matching: The owners of this hotel liked the pattern so much, they decided to cover the headboard as well

Clashing: The bedspread's pattern jars with the chequered carpet in this room

Keep those sunglasses on! This room has clashing hues of red, blue and orange

Bizarre: Chintzy flower patterns and seventies-inspired artwork are included in the 'top 10'

'These bedspreads take your breath away. It would be interesting to know what the owners of these hotels were thinking when they chose these outlandish colour schemes.'

Mr Buttle gave his own advice for hoteliers that might be thinking of turning their hand to interior design.  

'Although we would advocate any hotel owner putting their own personal design stamp on their hotel, there are limits,' he added. 'Simple, neutral colours will always be more appealing.

'It looks like some holidaymakers might need to wear their sunglasses in their hotel rooms as well as when they're out and about.'

Nautical theme? These blue bedspreads are 'complimented' by the wallpaper border

Bad taste: The shiny green and pink bedspreads are made worse by the wood panelling
