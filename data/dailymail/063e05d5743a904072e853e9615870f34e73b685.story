A pensioner whose car mounted the pavement and killed a woman out walking her dog claims she was suffering a diabetic episode at the time, a court heard.

Anne Cole, 69, denied causing the death of pedestrian Hazel I'Anson by careless driving, and says the sudden onset of hypoglycemia had left her incapable of controlling her car.

As Cole approached a mini-roundabout, her vehicle failed to give way to a tipper truck on her right and then accelerated, swerving up on to the pavement and knocking Mrs I'Anson high into the air, a jury was told.

Anne Cole denies causing death by dangerous driving claiming she suffered a 'diabetic episode' 

A witness said the 51-year-old crashed down on to the windscreen before being thrown face first into a wall.

Jeremy Grout-Smith, prosecuting, said Cole was involved in a 'near-miss' at another mini-roundabout moments earlier when she also failed to give way.

The driver in that incident, who was brake heavily, said she was just staring straight ahead and did not make any eye contact.

At the second roundabout in Leyland, Lancashire the tipper truck driver also had to brake suddenly as Cole drove across in front of him.

Witness Sean Smith, who had his wife and daughter in the car with him, saw the vehicle swerve off to the left and up on to the pavement where Mrs I'Anson had no chance to get out of the way.

'It was like the roundabout wasn't there.

'We got out of the car and ran over.

'Mrs I'Anson was breathing, but only shallow. Another man came along and started CPR.'

Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard that the pensioner 'was totally incapable due to lack of blood sugar' 

Mr Grout-Smith told the jury at Preston Crown Court: 'Mrs Cole's defence is that she suffers from diabetes and she was having a hypoglycemic episode at the time.

'She was totally incapable due to a lack of blood sugar.'

The trial continues.
