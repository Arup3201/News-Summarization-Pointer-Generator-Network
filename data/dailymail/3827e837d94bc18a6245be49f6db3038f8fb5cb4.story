Girls at a private school are bring taught how to 'blow their own trumpet' to help them get ahead in their careers.

The pupils will be taught the art of boasting and how to promote themselves, amid studies that have found women are too timid when it comes to celebrating their success.

Pupils at the all-girl £4,668-a-term Wimbledon High School are learning how to push themselves forward in the same way that boys do, so they won't miss out on top positions.

Girls will write down their achievements and success on postcards, which will be displayed around the single-sex school in south London.

Headteacher Heather Hanbury says that girls are reluctant to celebrate themselves because they fear a backlash from their peers, and do not want to be perceived as arrogant or boastful.

She said: 'Within the world of work, 
women do find it hard to self-promote because they have this view that 
there will be a backlash; that being seen as too confident or vain will 
actually make people dislike them.

'Men have been shown to get over that because they want this job or this pay rise,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

But Ms Hanbury was keen to make sure the girls did not exaggerate their success, and come across like self-obsessed participants on reality TV shows.

The week-long initiative is also designed to foster a sense of applauding others' achievements, amid fears that they are quick to put down their peers' achievements.

Young women are being held back by 
the belief they should put their children before their own ambitions, a 
leading headmistress warned in December.

Girls are still being brought up to 
believe that raising a family is more important than pursuing their 
personal goals, according to Hilary French.

She said schoolgirls needed to learn 
they were free to make their own decisions about how to balance their 
careers with bringing up a child.

Mrs French, the new president of the Girls’ Schools Association, criticised the continuing assumption that women should be responsible for childcare.

A survey in December last year found that women do not get pay rises, simply because they do not ask for them - the survey found that they are reluctant to knock on doors and demand a higher salary.

Whereas the study, led by Andreas Liebbrandt and John List and published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in the Unites States, found that men were happily prepared to march into the boardroom and open negotiations

The survey found that women felt more confident asking for more money when they were told that the salary was negotiable, or when their boss instructed them to request a raise.

The salary gap between the sexes in Britain is thought to be around 9.6 per cent, as women's earnings gradually increase.

The Office of National Statistics records that full-time female workers are gradually closing the gulf between salaries, with hourly pay increasing by two per cent to £12.
