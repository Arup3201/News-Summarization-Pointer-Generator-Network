She captured the nation's attention for all the wrong reasons in December 2008 when she claimed she had been in a seven year long extra-marital affair with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.

But now Sarah Symonds - who touted herself as a professional mistress after indulging in multiple affairs (she counts Lord Archer among her conquests) - says she is the 'worm that turned' after setting up a Wife School to help woman prevent their husband cheating.

And controversially, 43-year-old Sarah's top tip for wives to ensure the fidelity of a husband is to stop spending so much time in the kitchen and act more like their mistress.

As a well-known mistress, Sarah Symonds has set up an online help forum called The Wife School to coach women on how to  to become their husband's mistress

Sarah, who is not married herself but is currently dating ('only single men!') believes that men’s needs are 
actually very simple, and if women are smart enough, they can satisfy 
them and stop infidelity creeping into a relationship.

'It’s all about "the skills". I call it the ESF rule: Men need to Eat, Sleep, and Fornicate,' she says in an exclusive interview with MailOnline

'Give them those in abundance and you might just get a monogamous husband.related]

'Yes, it is controversial that I founded 
this organisation as a well-documented Other Woman. But who better than 
someone who has been on the inside of infidelity for so many years?

'I didn't want to be that person anymore. I see it as a way of trying to give something back 
to the world, to try to make up for so many of the wrongs I have 
done,' she said.

Sarah, from Newport, Wales, established Wife School, an online advice forum, after the success of her Canadian show The Mistress, which followed her on her mission to rescue women caught in the despair of an extra marital affair.

Sarah then appeared on hit U.S. show Dr Phil 
and took five mistresses on the show with her to discuss their 
livelihood; the show proved to get the best ratings of the entire series.

Sarah says she is a changed woman - and despite claiming to have slept with Gordon Ramsay (who, for the record, said of the claim: 'Did I have a torrid seven year affair with her? Did I f***!) now says she sees the school as a way to make up for the wrongs she has done

After her success over the pond, she moved back to Wales and set up Wife School, a non-profit making organisation ('you can't ask women in despair for money'), after 
hearing from so many wives asking for her advice.

She
 now receives a constant flow of emails from wives in despair who worry 
that their husband is cheating and are desperately seeking tips on how 
to stop it happening.

Speaking about her latest venture, she said: 'Wife School found me. I was working on my show The Mistress over in Canada which highlighted the topic and I had so many wives contacting me for advice.

Sarah answers women's questions when they fear that their husband is having an affair or simply want to spice up their marriage to stop their husband cheating

'The school is 
geared towards making today’s marriages more successful and to 
ultimately lessen the divorce rates, and the subsequent demise to our 
society’s structure. 

'Any marriage or committed relationship needs daily
 maintenance and nurturing - people just don't seem to realise that. 

'Marriage should be likened to a high powered job, once you land that job
 you know you need to show up daily, put a huge amount of effort into 
your role in order to keep it - and prosper within it - otherwise there 
is always the risk that someone may come along and take it from you.

'Therefore, if more people treated their marriage as they do their job, 
more marriages would last the lifetime they are supposed to.'

Sarah
 maintains that she has a hawkeye when it comes to spotting the signs of
 cheating - and she wants to point them out to other women before it's 
too late.

The self-proclaimed relationship guru
 maintains that it's the men who bury their heads in the sand, those who
 join the gym, change their routine and influences are those having 
affairs, and she is keen to open women's eyes to this.

'Don't allow space in your marriage for other women to walk into,' she adds.

Her main advice to women is: Do more in the bedroom than the kitchen. Stay up late at night to see how his day went. Be affectionate and be a good listener.

'I'm not a trained professional but I can relate and I know how men lie; I've got secrets and tips.'

Her long term plan is to turn her 
online venture into a physical school for women to engage in self-image 
lessons, learn communication skills and even fitness tips.

I
 believe that the whole Sisterhood has to bond together to beat these 
cheats right out of the sheets,' she says. 'A lot of men should worry because I am here to beat the cheats.'

'I am here to wake other women up and teach them not to be a mousewife,' she adds. And if all else fails, there’s always Wife School.'
