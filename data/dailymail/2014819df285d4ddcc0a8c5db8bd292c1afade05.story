Looks like butter wouldn't melt in this adorable mutt's mouth. But is this pooch  responsible for ripping up a whole box of tissues on the floor of its owner's living room?

Keen to find out which of his two dogs wasted an entire box of tissues, a bemused owner says: 'OK, which one of you made the mess with this paper? Who did this? Who tore up the Kleenex?'

But whichever mischievous dog committed the crime, it seems the owner might have trouble finding out - and poker-faced pooch Gnarly seems to be keeping schtum.

Poker-faced Gnarly is keeping quiet about a pile of ripped up tissues strewn over the living room floor

At first, it looks like Gnarly is the troublemaker. Looking down from the sofa at the damage on the floor, it seems he might not get off the hook easily. Is that a hint of guilt in his eyes?

His owner asks: 'Gnarly...did you do that? Did you do this right here?'

But before he receives a telling-off, the camera pans round and all is revealed - Gnarly's friend Casey hasn't done a very good job of covering his tracks.

He's standing, facing the wall, with a box of Kleenex stuck on his head. Maybe he's thinking if he can't see anyone, no one can see him? 

As he looks at the scene of the crime, Gnarly the pooch doesn't seem like a particularly innocent party

Looks like someone had a lot of fun with a slipper, a box of ripped up tissues and what appears to be a disembodied plastic frog - all strewn across the carpet at the scene of the crime

Casey is the culprit - padding around bewildered with a key piece of evidence on his head. Case closed!

But Casey has been well and truly rumbled, as the key piece of evidence is stuck on his head.

As Casey hangs his head, and the tissue box, in shame, his owner says: 'Casey, did you do that? I think you did...' 

Luckily for Casey, his owner puts him out of his misery and removes the box that's obstructing his view. Someone's in the dog house!
