Chicago and Boston Marathon winner Rita Jeptoo failed a September doping test, her agent revealed Friday.

Federico Rosa said that the 33-year-old  Kenyan tested positive for a banned substance in a test in Kenya before she won the Chicago Marathon in October.

Rosa said Jeptoo's 'A' sample tested positive and that they were now waiting for testing on a 'B' sample.

Reaction: Rita Jeptoo, 33, tested positive for a banned substance back in September, her agent revealed Friday 

Rosa said he learned of the failed test 'a few days ago' and did not name the substance that showed up in the test. 

'We will legally go after the person or the people that convinced Rita to do this,' Rosa said, saying that her management had 'nothing to do with' the doping. 

'I am sorry for Rita,' Rosa said.

Jeptoo won back-to-back titles in both the Chicago and Boston Marathons, setting a course record in April in Boston. Doping tests at the time came back negative. 

She also currently leads the World Marathon Majors, a championship-style competition across multiple cities.

The series announced the postponement of the awards ceremony, scheduled for Sunday, because of the positive test.

'No athlete can win the World Marathon Majors Series title who has been in breach of IAAF anti-doping rules,' a series official asserted.

The International Association of Athletics Federations released a statement that it was 'not in position where it can confirm or deny' the results of the test.

'The case remains in the confidentiality phase,' the IAAF said, 'although that should be lifted within the next week.' 

A report detailing Kenya's issues with doping was released earlier this month that found athletes in several sports have been found to be using banned substances.
