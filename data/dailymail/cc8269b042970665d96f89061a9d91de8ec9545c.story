A drunken British Airways cabin crew ran amok while off-duty on a flight sparking angry complaints from passengers, it emerged today.

Stewards and stewardesses were seen downing bottles of champagne and red wine in front of stunned onlookers in First and Club premium cabins.

Passengers said the BA staff began screaming and shouting 'like spoiled brats'. Some reported them kissing and 'heavy petting'.

Airline chiefs were last night investigating the incident, which came as the off-duty crew flew from London to Washington to pick up other flights on January 26.

Passengers paying up to £7,500 per seat were left unable to sleep. After complaints to the on-duty purser, the crew were told they could have no more to drink — sparking an almighty row.

One onlooker told The Sun: 'They were behaving like drunken spoilt brats and were incredibly unprofessional.

'They were running up and down the aisles, falling over and disturbing passengers. They let the airline down badly.'

A BA spokesman said: 'We apologise to customers. We’re investigating and will take any appropriate action.'

Earlier this month an off-duty BA pilot was suspended for a second time in months after molesting a woman passenger.

And in January, a British Airways flight had to make an emergency landing as two drunken middle-aged women on board ran riot.

The
pair aged 50 and 43 swore in front of children, refused to return to 
their seats and tried to force their way into the cockpit after being 
seen drinking Malibu from the bottle.

One
passenger claimed they even threatened to track down and kill the 
family of a BA stewardess on the Gatwick to Tunisia flight.
