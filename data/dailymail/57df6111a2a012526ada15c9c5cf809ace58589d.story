Craig Bellamy has told Newcastle fans they will never be as big as Liverpool or Manchester United. 

The ex-Newcastle forward believes the expectations of supporters at St James' Park are too high, and that the North East club will 'always be on the outskirts' of the Barclays Premier League giants.

Alan Pardew's men are in rejuvenated form, having beaten Liverpool 1-0 and Tottenham Hotspur 2-1, and Bellamy says results like that lead Newcastle fans to demand a win against West Brom.

'I remember finished fifth up there (in Newcastle) and that wasn't good enough,' Bellamy told Sky Sports before Newcastle took on West Brom on Sunday.

'It's a great place to be if you're winning but they (Newcastle supporters) always expect more.

'After beating Liverpool and after beating Spurs, fans will come here expecting to win. I have a lot of respect for Newcastle.

'It's a great club to play for but they have this idea that they should be bigger than Liverpool or just as big as Liverpool or Manchester United - they aren't.

'For they will always be on the outskirts of that.'
