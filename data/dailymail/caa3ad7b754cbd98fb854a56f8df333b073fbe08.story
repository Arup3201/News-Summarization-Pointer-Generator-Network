For all the noise surrounding the red half of Manchester this summer, you could be forgiven for forgetting that this country's pre-eminent football club are Manchester City, Premier League title winners in two of the past three seasons.

From Manchester City, there have been no grand proclamations. No talk of an unlimited budget. No new signings ordered to train alone in public view. No round of rumours over who will wear the captain's armband.

Under the leadership of Manuel Pellegrini - and directed from above by Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain - it is a calm and confident approach.

Competition: Willy caballero signed from Malaga and will provide stiff competition for England's Joe Hart

Five trophies in four years, winning everything there is to win in the domestic game, and the signals are that Manchester City are only going to get stronger.

This summer, they have added sensibly, strengthening the midfield with the commanding Brazilian Fernando, providing competition for the excellent Pablo Zabaleta with a move for Bacary Sagna and they will, most probably this week, finally place a centre-half of elite standing alongside Vincent Kompany with the £32million signing of Eliaquim Mangala.

City's anxieties to conform to Financial Fair Play regulations may deny them one final venture into the market to sprinkle some further stardust into Pellegrini's attacking pool but the Chilean will make do with glittering options that vary from David Silva and Stevan Jovetic to Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko.

For much of last season, Pellegrini spoke of his desire not to have a fixed starting line-up but a fluid system of play that would allow any of his players to come in and perform to the same level, regardless of personnel. With a squad that is now blessed with two top-drawer players in every position, his ambitions are now coming to fruition.

Very few players are now assured a starting place, perhaps only Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Sergio Aguero.

Joe Hart will be under threat from Willy Caballero whose precise distribution appeals to Pellegrini and indeed the system of play that is being adopted at all levels of the club, from the youth teams at age 11 to the first team.

At full-back, Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov are at a similar level to Zabaleta and Clichy. Martin Demichelis has overcome his teething problems to enjoy a remarkable renaissance.

In the midfield, Fernandinho and James Milner offer smart cover for Toure and Fernando. You get the drift. City are inundated with gifted footballers.

They could quite easily field two teams of the highest quality. On the weekend, it could be: Hart, Sagna, Kompany, Demichelis, Clichy, Fernando, Toure, Silva, Nasri, Aguero, Dzeko.

For a midweek cup game, Pellegrini can shuffle his pack and the standard would barely dip: Caballero, Zabaleta, Nastasic, Mangala, Kolarov, Lampard, Fernandinho, Navas, Milner, Jovetic, Negredo.

City have plenty to prove this season. At home, these players must demonstrate that they have the mentality to defend a Premier League title, after releasing their grip so meekly the season before last. On the continent, City must finally arrive on the European stage and start providing the kind of unforgettable nights that have been the norm over the years at Anfield, Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford.

There, is, though a feeling that this football club is beginning to mature into a consistent force and their rivals will know that City, once again, will be the team to beat this season.

Options: Stevan Jovetic has been impressing in pre-season and gives ellegrini yet another option up front
