Tragic: Coporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, hanged herself in her room at Bulford Barracks, Wiltshire in 2011

Colleagues of a soldier, who hanged herself two years after claiming she had been raped, released a box of live crickets in her room as part of a bullying campaign, an inquest has heard.

Corporal Charlotte Berrill also told the hearing in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the Army failed to investigate another soldier who acted 'unprofessionally' by telling a colleague that Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement had 'cried rape'.

Cpl Ellement, 30, was found dead at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury on October 9, 2011.

Her sister, Sharon Hardy, has told the inquest that she had been left 'absolutely devastated' by the decision by military investigators not to prosecute the two soldiers who she claimed had raped her in November 2009, while she was posted in Germany.

Cpl Berrill said Cpl Ellement had 'desperately' applied to be posted back to the UK after she had been 'bullied' by colleagues in Germany who accused her of 'crying rape'.

Cpl Berrill, who became friends with her while they were posted together in Bulford, said that Cpl Ellement would describe how she had been targeted by other female soldiers in her barracks in Germany.

She said: 'She had two pet bearded dragons, at one point, shortly after the rape allegation, she left the room to use the bathroom and a box of live crickets had been released in her room and they were everywhere.

'She told me she would get bangs on the door from the girls in the corridor and she said that Charlene (Pritchard) had said she had cried rape.'

She continued: 'She said to me that she was no longer her usual bubbly self, she felt she couldn’t trust anybody, she didn’t want to go out anywhere because she felt she didn’t have any friends to go out with.

'She desperately wanted to come back on a compassionate and she was happy when she got that.'

Cpl Pritchard denied when she gave evidence to the court that she banged doors or said to Cpl Ellement that she had cried rape.

Her colleague Corporal Charlotte Berrill also told the hearing in Salisbury, Wiltshire, that the Army failed to investigate another soldier who acted 'unprofessionally' by telling a colleague that Cpl Ellement (pictured) had 'cried rape'

Cpl Berrill told the inquest that she had reprimanded a soldier, Corporal Craig O’Grady, for talking about the rape allegations at Bulford in April 2011.

She said: 'I heard him saying she was a bitch and she had ruined his best friend’s life by crying rape.

'I confronted Cpl O’Grady and said that although everyone is entitled to an opinion, it’s not the kind of subject you should be talking about in a police station in front of other people who do not know what happened and you yourself do not know what happened.

'I thought is was highly unprofessional for somebody to talk about something so sensitive to people who had nothing to do with it.'

She continued: 'I informed Anne-Marie about what I had heard and told her what Cpl O’Grady said, she was very upset about it and angry, she was clenching her fists a few times, her eyes welled up immediately.'

Cpl Berrill said that she was then reprimanded by the regimental sergeant major for informing Cpl Ellement about the comments and relieved of her informal position of junior welfare officer.

She said: 'He said I was professional and did the right thing at that stage by halting the conversation but I was unprofessional and had lost all the respect of my peers because I had told Anne-Marie what had happened.'

Cpl Berrill thought 'it was not fair, ' and alleged there was 'no suggestion' the matter would be investigated.

'I knew there wasn’t anyone else she could turn to in the unit, if she lost her trust and confidence in me, she couldn’t talk to anybody,' she said.

Cpl Berrill went on to say that Bulford had a 'horrible' working environment.

She said: 'It’s not a very nice place, the camp itself is not in a good location, it’s isolated, it has its own weather system which makes it a more miserable place to be.

'As for the company, it wasn’t a nice place to work.

'In my honest opinion, it didn’t feel comfortable, the working environment felt very seniors versus juniors, I didn’t feel like you could mix between the two.'

Cpl Berrill said that Cpl Ellement was also singled out by physical training instructors who called her fat.

She said: 'In several PT lessons, they would parade the fit people in one section and the unfit people, myself included, in another section.

'I can’t remember the exact words but they would say ‘the fit will be doing this PT, the sick, lame and lazy and the fat, you will be doing this PT’.'

She said comments made about Cpl Ellement included: 'She was a bit fat, always downgraded.'

'In PT I heard her being treated differently, I heard the comments at PT.'

Cpl Berrill said that Cpl Ellement was downgraded on her physical fitness report and that her ski-ing instructors had given her a 'hard time' on a recent trip.

She said: 'I can’t recall exactly, she said to me that they had bullied her and victimised her by picking her out from the group.'

Cpl Berrill told the hearing that she had been told of comments made by a superior officer on Facebook who had taken a file of Cpl Ellement’s work home to check it over. The comment, which did not name Cpl Ellement, said: 'I have seen better work from a child.'

She said that she understood that the officer’s wife, who she believed worked as a primary school teacher, had also posted a comment on Facebook that 'the kids she teaches could do a better job.'

Corporal Kareena Brooke told the inquest by phone-link from Diego Garcia that she had an argument with Cpl Ellement in the late spring of 2011 in which she was hit in the face with a bottle, although she was not injured.

She said they were friends but they had been 'living in each other’s pockets too much' by the time of the incident as they had rooms facing each other in the barracks at Bulford.

She said that they were in a group at a pub in Salisbury playing a game where they made each other’s drinks fizz over.

She said that Cpl Ellement accidentally spilled her drink on her dress, which led to the argument in which she was hit with the bottle.

Cpl Brooke said she did not know if it had been accidental or deliberate and did not make a formal complaint but did ask to move rooms.

She denied that she attempted to turn people against Cpl Ellement following this incident.

She said: 'I do not know why I would turn people against her. Me and Anne-Marie, we obviously didn’t get on for a while after this, she had been asking for the guys to lie for her after that night so I wasn’t happy about it.

'I didn’t want to report it, I just wanted to move rooms.'

Cpl Brooke told the inquest that Cpl Ellement was in a good mood when she celebrated her birthday a few days before her death.

She said Cpl Ellement sang in a concert at a local village hall and they went on to a karaoke night in a pub in Amesbury.

Cpl Brooke said: 'She just seemed happy and in really high spirits, like really proud.'I had never noticed if she was upset or anything that night, she seemed quite happy in herself.”

Asked if she was aware of text messages sent to Cpl Ellement on the day of her death stating that her current boyfriend was ending their relationship, Cpl Brooke said: “I knew they had split, I do not know why, I cannot remember when I found out about it.'

Deputy coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon Nicholas Rheinberg told the court that police had been informed of an allegation of interfering with a witness of the inquest.He said: 'The matter has been reported to the police for investigation.

'Should it be the case the culprit is discovered, it’s likely that very severe penalties would follow, not only for breaches of the criminal law but also contempt of court and, on the facts being proved, a term of imprisonment would be on the cards.'
