West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard will have no reason to complain about the state of the Upton Park pitch on Saturday because of new rules saying the grass cannot exceed 30 millimetres in height.

After Liverpool won 2-1 in the corresponding fixture last season Gerrard, who scored two penalties, complained about West Ham’s direct style, the distance the team bus had to park from the ground, the temperature of the changing rooms and the pitch.

Allardyce said: ‘We’ve all got “grass size” this year — a certain size of grass that we can’t go beyond. It’s one of the most bizarre rules I’ve ever seen. Someone’s got a measuring tape to see what size your grass is.’

Steven Gerrard's complaint about the pitch at Upton Park is nullified by new grass rules, says Sam Allardyce

Gerrard won Liverpool's returning match in the Champions League against Ludogorets with a penalty

Two penalties from Gerrard saw Liverpool claim a tough victory over West Ham last season

Gerrard claimed after the win in April that West Ham had ‘tried everything to upset’ them.

Allardyce said: ‘They came and said that the coach couldn’t park where it should have parked, the changing rooms were too hot, the grass was too long and they still managed to win by two penalties.’

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has hit back at Allardyce’s claim that a lack of focus caused Liverpool’s 1-0 defeat by Aston Villa last week because of their return to the Champions League. Rodgers said: ‘No we weren’t complacent. We are allergic to complacency here.’
