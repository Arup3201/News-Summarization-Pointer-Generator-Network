Radamel Falcao's time at Manchester United seems set to be curtailed at the end of the season after a faltering year from the Colombia international.

The 29-year-old striker has only hit the net four times in a barren season so far at Old Trafford.

He was seen heading to a restaurant for lunch in Manchester on Wednesday, taking time away from his side's preparations to play Liverpool on Sunday by enjoying some food in his adopted city.

Falcao arrived in Manchester on a deadline day loan deal, with United having the option to make the move permanent for £43million at the end of the season.

But the attacker's role at United has diminished as the season has progressed, with manager Louis van Gaal notoriously electing not to bring him off the substitutes bench in the 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final defeat at home to Arsenal.

His team currently occupy the fourth and final Champions League position in the Premier League but face an examination of their credentials when they play Liverpool on Sunday.

Liverpool are only two points behind United in the Premier League table and can usurp United and move fourth with a victory.
