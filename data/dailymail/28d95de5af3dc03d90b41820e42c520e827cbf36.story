A series of 10 beautiful, vintage Ferraris are gearing up for what could be the most impressive car auction of all time, with most expected to fetch more than $1m.

The classic supercars come from the Maranello Rosso Collection, were manufactured over four decades and all come with rich racing history.

Spearheading the auction is the 1953 Ferrari 250 Mille Miglia Berlinetta, which was tailor-made to compete in long distance races and was one of the quickest cars of its time.

The 1953 250 Mille Miglia Berlinetta is the auction's star attraction. It was designed for long distance racing and can do 0-60mph in just 5.1 seconds. It was a race winner in its debut meeting and, as possibly the most special car in the collection, It is valued at around $12m

The 1968-69 Dino 166/246T Formula 2 is a classic racing car, and is a back-to-back Tasman Championship winner. It is expected to sell for around $1.8m at auction

The Ferrari 365 GTC (left) is a two-seater coupé and the first street car from Maranello to feature all-independent suspension. The 250 GT Series 1 Cabriolet (right) is the eighth of just 40 made, and is estimated to sell for up to $8.5m

This 312 T3 Formula 1 Racing Ferrari is expected to make around $2m at auction. This particular car has finished on the podium at F1 events, while Gilles Villenueve won the 1978 British Grand Prix in the sister car

In May 1954, Road & Track magazine tested future World Champion Phil Hill's own sister Ferrari 250MM and reached 0-60mph in just 5.1 seconds, and 0-100mph in 13.7 seconds.

The magazine said: 'Never before have I accelerated so rapidly, travelled so fast, or decelerated so suddenly.'

The Gran Turismo car's racing history began in California in 1953 when American racer Bill Devin made his public debut in the new Ferrari at the Sports Car Club of America San Francisco Region's third Annual Members' Madera race.

The 1962 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Speciale Aerodinamica is valued at $7m and is one of only four made on this short wheel base chassis. It is ove of the most exclusive Ferraris by Pininfarina

The 1969 Dino 206 GT (left) has been exhibited for many years in the late-Fabrizio Violati's Collezione Maranello Rosso's developing museum. The beautiful 1969 365 GTB/4 Daytona Berlinetta Competizione (right) competed during the 1970s

The 1981 512 Boxer Berlinetta Bellancauto Le Mans Endurance Racing Competition Coupe took part in two Le Mans races and also competed at World Championship level at Monza and Mugello

He finished third in the novice event before handing the car over to fast-rising Santa Monica star driver Phil Hill, who won the main event that day in it.

In 1986 the car returned to its native Italy and joined the collection of Count Vittorio Zanon di Valgiurata, who co-drove the car in that year's Mille Miglia Storica event.
