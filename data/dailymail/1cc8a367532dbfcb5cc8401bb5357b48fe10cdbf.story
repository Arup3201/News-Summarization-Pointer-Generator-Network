A crewman has died and 11 others had to be rescued when stormy seas overcame their vessel in the North Sea.

The Vos Sailor was damaged and took on water during severe weather overnight. Coastguard launched a rescue mission after a mayday call at 4.30am and 11 crew members were winched to safety.

Police said one man was fatally injured however. His body has not yet been recovered.

Meanwhile, a major rescue operation took place in Sunderland this afternoon after 15 fishermen were knocked off their feet by waves which crashed over Roker Pier.

The men were fishing on the pier and
a man in his 60s was left with a broken leg following the incident at 1.30pm. 
He was winched off the pier by helicopter and taken to hospital in Newcastle. Rescue teams were forced to evacuate the other men through a tunnel 
underneath the pier.

The stricken vessel in the North Sea, which was deployed on the Balmoral Oil 
field, sustained significant damage.

At present emergency services cannot board the boat, and are trying to return it to shore.

'It appears at this time that one crew member has suffered fatal injuries,' a Grampian Police spokesman said.

'Next of kin have been informed of this situation although no details can be confirmed at this time. 

'Efforts are ongoing to recover the vessel which will be brought in to Aberdeen harbour in due course.

'As is normal in such circumstances a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.'

Aberdeen Coastguard was contacted 
just before 4.30am by a nearby installation who heard the faint mayday, 
as stormy weather wreaked havoc across the country.

The
vessel in difficulty sustained significant damage and became disabled 
while on standby vessel duties 120 miles Northeast of Aberdeen.

Six
other vessels, and three helicopters were sent to the scene. This 
includes the Coastguard Search and Rescue helicopter from Sumburgh, an 
RAF helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth and Bond 1 – the BP Jigsaw 
helicopter.

At the time, winds in the area were reported to be south-easterly 60-75 knots with 6.5 metre seas.

Non-essential crew on the nearby North Sea Producer, a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, were evacuated to other rigs as a precaution because the disabled boat was drifting.

The incident in Sunderland took place at about 1.30pm this afternoon. A total of 15 fisherman were hit by two huge waves, which knocked them off their feet.

Bev Allen, watch manager for Humber Coastguard, said: 'We had a number of people on the pier at Roker who were knocked off their feet. One sustained a broken leg and they all had to be evacuated off.

'They were anglers hit by two successive waves which knocked them all over. If anybody had of gone into the water it would have been very dangerous.'

The man with the broken leg was winched off the pier by a rescue helicopter while the remaining fisherman were evacuated through a tunnel under the pier. It has now been closed to the public.

More than 120 areas across the UK are on flood alert this morning with heavy rain set to lash the country over the weekend.

The Environment Agency increased the number of areas at risk overnight as rain continued for a second day.

While
the worst affected places are in the South West, 128 areas across the 
South East, Midlands, central and northern England, Wales and southern 
and central Scotland are also on alert.

The
weather has been so severe that pensioners were forced to flee their 
homes because of raging coastal floods in Aberdeenshire.  

High tides and drastic conditions led to 25 people being taken from sheltered housing complexes at Stonehaven.

They were taken to St Bridget's Hall in the town, where a rest centre was set up.

Further north at Peterhead, about 30 people were evacuated from properties in the Roanheads area.

Some stayed with friends while others were given accommodation at a hotel, according to Aberdeenshire Council.

People at a care home in Huntly, which
sits inland at the River Deveron, were told to prepare to leave but 
later given the all clear.

Willie
Munro, of Aberdeenshire Council, said: 'Trained council staff and 
emergency services personnel are on hand at St Bridget's Hall to provide
support for the people who have been evacuated.

'High
tide in Stonehaven has passed and, while we continue to monitor the 
levels of the River Carron closely, there are currently no concerns that
the river will flood.'

Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse 
said: 'Local emergency services moved quickly to deal with the aftermath
of the flooding, which was caused by unusually high tides and high 
winds, in Stonehaven and Peterhead.

'Emergency staff are also monitoring 
the situation at Lossiemouth. They have all demonstrated the utmost 
professionalism in the face of very challenging weather conditions.

'Local residents affected by the 
floods have been moved to safety and offered support. I want to express 
my sympathy for their ordeal.'

The heavy rain is expected to stay for the weekend, before a brighter start to the week, although the rain will return on Thursday

Authorities took the action because of unusually high waters, which also affected other parts of Scotland.

In Wick, on the far north coast, roads were closed and fishing boats were damaged in high winds.

About 12 cars were moved from a car park when a strong surge breached a river bank, police said.

Several roads were closed by debris thrown up by the waves.

A further 15 areas across the west, as
well as in Northampton and Warrington, are expected to flood, the 
Environment Agency said.

Around
30 commercial properties were flooded yesterday in the coastal town of 
Looe, south Cornwall, as a band of heavy rain swept in from the 
Atlantic.

Tom Tombler, 
meteorologist for MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press 
Association, said: 'The heavy rain will affect mostly the western parts 
of the the UK and southern England as well as Wales.

'The risk of localised flooding remains throughout the day, especially in areas which saw heavy rain yesterday.

'Between 10mm and 20mm is expected in the worst-hit areas.

'Temperatures will remain milder though, around 10C for most areas.'

The heavy rain is expected to stay for 
the weekend, before a brighter start to the week, he added, although the
rain will return on Thursday.

Firefighters praised the speedy actions of three hunters who found a man desperately clinging to a tree following a flash flood.

Early this morning crews were called to a brook, near the River Exe in Devon, which had swollen to around 6ft deep.

More than 12 firefighters helped rescue the man, who was taken to hospital suffering with hypothermia.

The fire service said it believed he had taken a wrong turn while walking back to his home in Exwick, near Exeter, before slipping into the brook.

Sean Faulkner, from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Luckily there was a group of three gentlemen who were out hunting and they heard his cries, because it was in the middle of nowhere, and they raised the alarm.

'If it wasn't for the swift actions of the men and the crew it could have been a different outcome.'

A spokeswoman for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said crews received a 999 call to the incident at around 1.15am today.

She also added the service had received around 10 calls relating to flooding within the past 24 hours.

Yesterday Plymouth endured 29mm of rain, while Culdrose in west Cornwall received 21mm in 18 hours.

The Environment Agency is still advising people to stay away from seafronts, quaysides and jetties along the south coast to avoid powerful waves.

A spokesman said: 'The strong winds and high tides can be quite dangerous for people walking along the coast, with waves breaking on to coastal paths.'

The combination of warmer temperatures and flash floods have dashed hopes of a white Christmas.

Met Office forecaster George Goodfellow said: 'It’s mild and wet at the moment and it looks unsettled with showers of spells of rain ahead all the way into January, with low pressure for much of the time.

'There’s no signal for a colder spell in the Christmas period. Temperatures are expected to be around average - and snow is rare in the South in late December.

'There’s always a higher chance of snow on hills and mountains in Scotland and the North, but there’s no indication of a widespread wintry spell.

'Rain will be accompanied by strong winds and perhaps gales in exposed northern and western areas at times.'MeteoGroup forecaster John Lee said:

'Christmas looks unsettled with south-westerly winds keeping it mild. A white Christmas is unlikely.'
