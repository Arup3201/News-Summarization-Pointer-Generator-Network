E-fit: How Italy's top Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro could look after a fresh sighting

Police have revealed a new e-fit of Italy's most wanted Mafia boss after an informant saw him in hiding - where he has been for 21 years.

Convicted murderer Matteo Messina Denaro, now 51, was last seen at a beach resort in 1993 and is said to have boasted of killing enough people to fill a cemetery.

The new image has emerged just three months after police swooped on the town where Messina Denaro grew up in Sicily and arrested his sister, cousin and nephew.

Police claim the fugitive, nicknamed Diabolik after an Italian comic book master villain, still runs many of the Mafia's rackets in Sicily around the small town of Castelventrano where he grew up.

The son of a Mafia boss, he is alleged to have used guns aged 14 and committed murder at 18 but could now be blind in one eye thanks to a retina disease, Italian news agency Ansa reported.

His disappearance from a resort in Tuscany two decades ago came after the so-called 'boss of bosses' Salvatore 'The Beast' Riina was given life in jail for ordering bomb attacks on two state prosecutors.

Police say he was involved in five car bomb attacks in Florence, Milan and Rome which rocked the country over the summer of 1993, leaving 10 people dead, injuring 93 and damaging Florence's Uffizi Gallery, which includes such treasures as Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus.

Rare sightings of Denaro came in the mid-1990s at an eye specialist in Barcelona, Spain, where he concealed his identity by omitting his second surname - which translates as 'money'.

Over the years, as many other Mafia bosses were captured or killed, Denaro moved up police rankings to claim the spot of the nation's most wanted man.

In 2002, he was jailed for life in his absence for murder, Mafia association and other crimes.

The new images are notable because despite Denaro's eye problems, one of the photo-fits does not picture him wearing glasses.

New descriptions of him suggest he is taller and heavier-set than thought before, with a receding hairline and hair which remains remarkably dark for his 51 years.

The new image is the first in recent history to be based on an actual sighting, instead of computerised age progressions which were modelled on his driver's licence.

Police have never captured an image of Denaro on CCTV, despite his reputation as a playboy with a love of sports cars and designer watches.

Yet investigators believe he has not strayed far from his home town, which has a population of just 30,000.

A police statement in December said the Castelvetrano crime clan had 'an almost monopolistic control of the construction sector'.

One project the Mafia group is said to have infiltrated was the building of a wind farm to generate electricity for public roads and restaurants.

Police commander Mario Parente said his team was closer than ever before to Denaro in December after the arrest of 30 people, including his sister.

Patrizia Messina Denaro was led away to a police car at 3am after investigators claimed wire taps showed she had been in contact with her fugitive brother, and played a key role in transmitting his directives to other mobsters.

Prosecutor Teresa Principato told a press conference his 'sister can carry out a role, traditionally held by males. But this doesn't mean that men weren't capable of taking Matteo Messina Denaro's place'.

Mario Messina Denaro, the fugitive's cousin, and Francesco Guttaduro, his nephew, were also among those arrested.

Police said in December that they had more suspects lined up, but were choosing to follow them covertly rather than arrest them and destroy a possible channel to Denaro's whereabouts.
