Developers are building homes on green fields rather than on derelict sites in towns and cities because of new Government planning rules, a report said yesterday.

It said that the Whitehall push for a construction boom is overriding concerns that ‘brownfield’ sites should be used first.

The report from the National Trust and a local government think-tank said developers are successfully arguing that they can only build on green fields by claiming that brownfield projects would lose money.

The claim by the charity and the Local Government Information Unit, a body largely funded by local councils, adds to the pressure on ministers over the new planning rules, brought in a year ago amid a wave of criticism.

Opponents say the rules will lead to building over large areas of countryside against the wishes of those living in the suburban and rural areas.

Ministers anxious to provide more and cheaper homes for a fast-rising population have told councils to produce local plans which include room for large-scale housing projects.

Their rules also say planning decisions should be biased in favour of ‘sustainable’ development, a rule which conservationists say simply means the planning system will be skewed in favour of builders.

Developers claim the new system led to a 45 per cent increase in the number of projects given the go-ahead last autumn. Chancellor George Osborne added to the new homes push in the Budget by offering interest-free state loans for five years to those who buy new houses or flats.

The loans will be worth 20 per cent of the value of homes costing up to £600,000.

Yesterday’s report said the National Planning Policy Framework is tipping the scales against brownfield development because it requires councils to produce local plans including housebuilding that can be completed inside five years.

This means that 400,000 sites across the country which already have planning permission for homes are unlikely to be included in development plans because builders say it will be too expensive to start construction inside five years.

Brownfield sites are more expensive than virgin land because they need to be cleared and cleaned.

‘The fact that greenfield sites are more profitable to develop than brownfield sites, and therefore more viable, is forcing councils to propose development of these sites,’ the report said.

Peter Nixon of the National Trust, said: ‘We are very concerned that the principal of “brownfield first” is being eroded as the new plans emerge.

‘Our research suggests a growing number of greenfield sites are being prioritised for development with developers arguing that brownfield sites – many of which already have planning permission for construction – are now unprofitable to build on.’

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has insisted ‘we are making the most of every single square inch of brownfield land’.
