Aldi has taken an axe to the spiralling cost of Christmas trees, with a bargain price that appears to undercut all its rivals.

The retailer’s Scottish-grown Nordman Fir is just £19.99, around half the price of a similar real tree at some other stores.

With the addition of a box of decorations for £1.99, Aldi is promising customers a completed Christmas tree for £22.00 – just 70p a day if they have it up for a month.

A similar 5 to 6ft tree of the same variety at Homebase comes in at £35, while one from John Lewis would set you back £65. The move is likely to trigger an all-out price war, as other shops and tree farms struggle to compete.

Furniture giant IKEA is offering a 6ft Nordman Fir for £25, along with a £20 gift voucher for the store.

But the vouchers can only be used between January 19 and February 8 2015 – too late to pick up any of this year’s decorations. Each year more than £1billion is spent on Christmas trees, which are now sold everywhere from farms and street corners to garden centres and supermarkets.

More than 90 per cent of real tree sales take place during the first two weekends of December.

Charlie Reynolds, 19, who owns and runs the Keele Christmas Tree Farm in Staffordshire, said his team expect to have sold more than half of their 7,000 trees by the end of tomorrow. But he said that while he sells 5ft Nordman Firs for £35, prices can vary in different parts of the country.

‘I’ve got friends who work on tree farms further south and they charge mad money for it, sometimes double what we sell them for,’ he said.

‘We’ve sold 2,000 trees already this year and I expect to do another 2,000 by the end of this weekend. That will mean that by Monday we’ll have sold more than 4,000 trees and it will only be December 8. It’s very unusual.’

Nordman Firs account for around 80 per cent of the 6.5million Christmas trees purchased in the UK every year.

They are popular due to the fact they hold their needles for weeks and have a pleasant fragrance.

The Norway Spruce was once a traditional favourite because it grows faster and can be harvested earlier – although it has a reputation for dropping its needles quickly if not kept properly watered.

Its decline in popularity is reflected in this year’s prices, with Homebase offering 5-6ft Norway Spruce trees for just £15.

Nordman Firs – the UK’s most popular Christmas trees – originate from the mountains on either side of the Black Sea, primarily in Turkey and Georgia.

They have dark green, glossy needles and tend to grow into a neat, conical shape.

Needles are flat, gently rounded and slow to fall compared with other firs, even as the tree dries out.

They grow between 3 and 8 inches a year and if left in the wild can reach more than 100ft.

Most Christmas trees sold in the UK are between 5 and 6ft tall. It takes a Nordman Fir about seven years to reach this height.

Christmas trees first became popular in England in 1841 when Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert, brought one over from Germany for Windsor Castle.
