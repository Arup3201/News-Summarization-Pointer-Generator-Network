A number of ‘very high profile’ figures are to be arrested over new child sex abuse allegations, a top prosecutor has revealed.

Detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal and other historic sex allegations are preparing a dramatic new wave of celebrity arrests.

In an extraordinary public statement, Nazir Afzal of the Crown Prosecution Service said child sex abuse inquiries are a ‘growing industry’ and more arrests are planned for the next few weeks.

Paedophile Gary Glitter and PR guru Max Clifford have both been arrested and bailed as part of Operation Yewtree

Mr Afzal, who has specialised in 
prosecuting child grooming cases, said those due to be detained were not
directly linked to Savile – regarded as Britain’s most prolific 
predatory paedophile.

Instead, he said, they were among the ‘others’ 
identified by detectives as having committed similar alleged offences.

‘This is a growing industry,’ said Mr 
Afzal. ‘There are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks. Some 
are very high-profile figures.’

He added: ‘They are people whose names 
have come forward because of the high profile of child abuse in recent 
months. There are people you will be interested in.’

Mr Afzal’s comments came as he took 
part in a London seminar on tackling child abuse, organised by the 
Policy Exchange think tank.

Historic claims: The Jimmy Savile scandal has prompted a wave of fresh accusations against several celebrities

His comments are likely to prompt a backlash
from showbusiness personalities who claim they are the victim of a 
post-Savile ‘celebrity witch-hunt’.

As chief crown prosecutor for the 
North-West, Mr Afzal is overseeing the prosecution of former It’s A 
Knockout presenter Stuart Hall over historic child sex allegations.

Mr 
Hall, 83, has described the claims as ‘pernicious, callous, cruel and 
above all spurious’.

Mr Afzal is also overseeing the 
prosecution of Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell, 48, who is 
charged with 19 sexual offences against a child including rape, indecent
assault and sexual activity. He denies the charges.

Privately, a number
of senior police and legal figures were stunned that Mr Afzal, tipped 
by some as a potential future Director of Public Prosecutions, had 
chosen to hype up the impending arrests of yet more celebrities for 
alleged child sex abuse.

New claims: Dave Lee Travis outside his home in Bedfordshire yesterday

Dave Lee Travis yesterday insisted his ‘conscience is clear’ as he faced a fresh wave of sex assault claims.

The former Radio 1 DJ, who was first arrested in November, was re-arrested and questioned about new evidence by Operation Yewtree detectives after answering bail on Monday.

It is understood officers quizzed him about 11 ‘incidents’ after further women came forward.

Travis, 67, who was bailed until April, said his reputation has been ‘tarnished and dragged through the mud’ despite nothing having been proved against him.

Outside his £1million Bedfordshire mansion he said: ‘The last four months have been extraordinary. Allegations which I strongly deny have been put to me by the police and to which I have given full and complete answers.

'I have fully co-operated and my conscience is clear. They are carrying out a wide-ranging investigation concerning allegations made against many people over many decades.

‘I’m simply one of those people. I ask you to take into account that I was not and have not been charged with anything by the police.’

The original claims against Travis involved two adult women who claimed he molested them in the 1970s and 80s.

One was former Sky presenter Vivien Creegor, 55, who said he groped her while she was reading the news on Radio 4.

The Magic AM presenter, who was taken off air after his first arrest, said his wife had been ‘extremely distressed’ at the way he has been treated. He added that he has had ‘amazing support’ from many people.

But child protection campaigners 
believe his comments reflect mounting concern that police failed to 
protect young girls from Savile and other predatory celebrities 
suspected of decades of offending.

Earlier this week HM Inspectorate of 
Constabulary warned in a highly critical report that officers had 
repeatedly failed to respond to evidence of Savile’s criminal activities
over nearly 50 years.

Detective Chief Superintendent Keith 
Niven, the head of Scotland Yard’s child abuse command, told the Policy 
Exchange meeting, however, that more offenders would now be brought to 
justice and said cases being reported to the Met had ‘rocketed up the 
scale’ since the Savile scandal broke.

Meanwhile, 11 more alleged offenders 
have been arrested or questioned under Operation Yewtree, set up by the 
Met to investigate crimes by Savile and his accomplices, plus other 
historic sex abuse crimes. Those arrested include PR consultant Max 
Clifford, comedian Freddie Starr and DJ Dave Lee Travis, who all deny 
any wrongdoing.

Last night a Crown Prosecution Service
spokesman, asked about Mr Afzal’s comments, said: ‘This is an 
operational matter for the police.’

Scotland Yard indicated its officers 
were not intending to make any new celebrity arrests, prompting 
speculation that Mr Afzal was referring to planned arrests in the 
North-West.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
