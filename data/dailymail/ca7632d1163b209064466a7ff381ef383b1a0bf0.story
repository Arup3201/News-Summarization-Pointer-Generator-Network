Researchers from the University of Manchester have used CT scanning to take high-resolution 3D images of a caterpillar as it morphs into a painted lady butterfly. 

The scientists were able to track every stage of the caterpillar's development and discovered never-before-seen details, including how early the adult respiratory system appears. 

The scientists were trialling the use of CT scanners, which are traditionally used by doctors to find tumours and internal injuries in humans, as an alternative to dissection.

These images show the pupa of the painted lady butterfly. Taken using CT scanning, the images show anatomical details of the pupa as it grows. The red section is the pupa's digestive organs, also known as the midgut. You can also see the growth of the antennae and the eyes

There are four stages of a butterfly's development; the egg, larva, pupa and butterfly.

Butterfly eggs are usually tiny and laid on the underside of host plants.

Eggs may also be left in areas around the host plant.

If eggs are laid early enough in a season they will become butterflies within about a week.

If they are laid later in the season the eggs may have to wait until the following season to complete metamorphosis. 

The next stage is the caterpillar.

Caterpillar's can be hairy and their appearance varies between species.

Throughout the larval stage a caterpillar has to shed its skin several times in order to grow.

The time between these sheddings is called an 'instar', there are usually five 'instars' and they last between two to four weeks.

During the final 'instar' the pupa emerges.

It is usually camouflaged against the plant they live on.

The pupa stage lasts about two weeks, in which time the butterfly develops and breaks out of its chrysalis.

Dissection requires killing different specimens at each stage of development to learn more about the insect. 

Computed Tomography (CT) is a non-intrusive way of scanning the inside of living beings and was used to get detailed images of tiny insects. 

The Manchester research team scanned nine Vanessa cardui pupas as they morphed into the painted lady butterflies.

The pupas studied were 5mm big. 

They were hung inside a drinking straw and were slowly spun round. 

The CT scanner was then able to take 2000 X-rays as the caterpillar grew and broke out of its chrysalis.

As the insects grew, the 3D images showed the development of the anatomy of the butterflies, including the tracheal airways, the antennae and the midgut.

Researchers say that this new technique could be used to study the development of a wide range of insects.

The CT scanners used by the University of Manchester to analyse the insides of the painted lady's 5mm pupa captured high-resolution 3D images. On the left of this image you can see the insides of the pupa, including the red midgut and the blue veins. The image on the right is shows the development of the eyes, wings and antennae

These images show how the dorsal (back), lateral (side) and ventral (abdomen) of the pupa changed from day one to day thirteen of the study by University of Manchester.

By day 14 of the study, the pupa was ready to morph into the butterfly. In this CT scan image you can see the eyes at the top, the midgut and main internal organs in the centre, and the wings at the bottom

It could specifically be used to see how pesticides affect the development of bees, as the number of honey bees in particular are falling across many regions. 

The scientists also said they could use CT scanning to see how genetic manipulation affects the development of the fruit fly. 

Co-author of the study, geologist Russell Garwood told LiveScience: 'To a first approximation, every living thing is an insect, so they're worth understanding'.

He claimed that between 50 and 85% of animals on the planet are insects, but most scientists only study a small selection of these bugs. 

This leaves room to learn much more about insects and how they develop.

'Insects are the main pollinators for the majority of our crops,' so understanding what causes them to become ill is critically important, Garwood said.

The researchers also said they can also see the technique being used in forensics to study flesh-eating maggots that eat decomposing bodies.

The study featured in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.
