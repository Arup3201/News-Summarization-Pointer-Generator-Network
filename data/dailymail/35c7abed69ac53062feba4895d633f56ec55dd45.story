More than a third of Britons go on holiday without sufficient insurance, with the average cost to receive treatment abroad totalling £747.

Treating broken bones and suffering sickness bugs are the two top complaints for the 37 per cent of these holidaymakers who have needed medical treatment while abroad.

Infections, alcohol-related conditions or accidents and dehydration make up the top five most popular complaints travellers without insurance have required attention for.

Broken limbs on holiday was the top reason for treatment in hospitals while on holiday (posed by model)

More than 1,700 adults who had been on holiday at least once in the past year were questioned for the survey.

Initially, respondents were asked ‘Have you ever travelled abroad without taking out travel insurance, for a holiday, business or any other reason?’ to which 66 per said no. 

The 34 per cent who indicated that they had travelled without insurance were then asked if they had ever received medical treatment while abroad, to which 63 per cent answered no. 

The 37 per cent, who had answered yes, were asked to provide information on the medical treatment required while they were abroad.

Worth the risk? Out of 1732 Brits asked 34% travelled without insurance in last two years

Broken Limbs (67 per cent), sickness bugs (56 per cent), viral infections (34 per cent), drinking related conditions/accidents (28 per cent) and dehydration (21 per cent) make up the top five medical treatments holidaymakers without travel insurance have needed.

The average cost of treatment was revealed as £747.

Matthew Wood of vouchercloud.com, which carried out the survey, said: ‘I think that what this shows is a need for education in how cheap travel insurance can be, with some single-trip insurance being as low as £15.

‘Surely that is a better price to pay for the security of knowing that if you need medical assistance abroad, you aren’t going to be stung with an enormous bill and potentially ruin your trip.

‘The unexpected can happen at any time to anyone, so for the sake of an extra few pounds, it really isn’t worth the risk.’
