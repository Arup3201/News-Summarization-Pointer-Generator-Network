Killer: Christopher Halliwell's ex-girlfriend has told how they had sex hours after he murdered 22-year-old Sian O'Callaghan

The former lover of killer Christopher Halliwell has revealed how they had sex just hours after the taxi-driver assaulted and murdered office worker Sian O'Callaghan.

Heather Widdowson was unaware when she got into bed with her 48-year-old partner that he had abducted and stabbed 22-year-old Sian while out driving his cab in Swindon in the early hours of that same morning.

'He took me to bed that afternoon just hours after he killed her,' the 55-year-old said, as she described her revulsion at discovering what 'sick' Halliwell had done.

'I don't know how he managed to keep his feelings to himself but I remember he was laughing and joking,' she said.

Ms Widdowson also told The Sun the divorced father-of-three text her to tell her he loved her shortly before he carried out his brutal attack on Miss O'Callaghan in March last year.

The office worker was making her way back to the home she shared with her boyfriend after leaving Swindon's Suju nightclub when she got into Halliwell's green Toyota Avensis taxi.

Instead of taking her home, the killer drove Miss O'Callaghan to nearby Savernake Forest where he sexually assaulted and killed her.

The taxi-driver was jailed for life for her murder at Bristol Crown Court on Friday.

Ms Widdowson told how, the morning after the savage attack, her then partner awoke unusually early and told her he had 'a lot to do', before taking his cab to a car wash.

She now knows Halliwell's early-morning errand was an attempt to cover up his horrific crime.

The cab driver also moved Miss O'Callaghan's body to a location in Uffington, Oxfordshire. He eventually led police to her remains following his arrest on March 24 2011.

Halliwell's ex-wife Lisa, a nurse, has told how the killer collected his teenage son in his taxi the day after his attack on Miss O'Callaghan.

Halliwell seemed 'completely normal' the day after the attack, according to his then girlfriend Heather Widdowson

She said the 48-year-old, who will serve at least 25 years in prison, has sent a grovelling letter to his family begging their forgiveness.

Ms Widdowson, who met Halliwell in 2003 and moved in with him following his split from his ex-wife, told how he put posters of missing Sian up in the cab he used to abduct her as police searched for the 22-year-old following her disappearance.

Halliwell's former partner said he grew ashen-faced when asked to give a DNA sample by police who were interviewing local taxi drivers as a routine part of their investigation. He was arrested on March 24.

To Ms Widdowson's horror, she learned the taxi driver also led police to the remains of another victim, Becky Godden-Edwards. She had been dead for at least six years.

It has now emerged that Halliwell could now face questioning over a string of unsolved killings.

'In all the years I'd been with Chris, he was hiding this sick secret,' his ex-partner said.

Sentencing Halliwell to a minimum of 25 years for Miss O'Callaghan's murder, Mrs Laura Justice Cox DBE said he had abused his position as a taxi driver.

'There was here a prolonged period of time in which she would have suffered extreme fear and terror as well as severe pain from the injuries you inflicted upon her,' the judge said.

Investigation: Police officers are seen searching a wooded area near Uffington, Oxfordshire, where Sian O'Callaghan's body was found

In an emotional statement outside the court, Miss O’Callaghan’s mother Elaine said: ‘There is never total closure, just accepting my life has changed for ever. I am just a mother who wants her daughter back.’

While the sentencing would not bring her daughter back, it would mean Halliwell could not take any more, she said.

Karen Edwards, the distraught mother of Becky Godden-Edwards, was also at the hearing on Friday.

But Halliwell escaped justice over the charge related to Miss Godden-Edwards death after a judge ruled his legal rights had been breached by detectives during the course of their investigations.

The outcome was slammed by Karen Edwards, who said: 'What is wrong with this country when Halliwell's rights are more important than ours?

'He led police to my daughter's body, but he can't be tried for her murder? It doesn't make any sense,' she said.

'All we want is justice for Becky.'

A heroin addict since the age of 16, troubled Becky left home on December 17 2002, promising her mother she would return when she was clean.

But police arrived at her mother's door in April last year- on what would have been Becky's 29th birthday - to tell her that her daughter's remains had been found in a shallow grave in a field.
