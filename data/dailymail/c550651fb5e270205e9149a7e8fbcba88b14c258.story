Controversial David Silvester - a member of Henley Town Council - spoke out at an extraordinary meeting last on Tuesday evening called to consider whether he should resign

A UKIP councillor who said the floods plaguing Britain were caused by the homosexual marriage law,  has been expelled from the party after saying gays should repent.

Controversial David Silvester - a member of Henley Town Council - spoke out at an extraordinary meeting last on Tuesday evening called to consider whether he should resign.

He made national headlines two weeks ago when he wrote a letter to his local newspaper saying that the deluge of floods was caused because of David Cameron’s successful move to change the law about same-sex marriage.

At a meeting of the town council on Tuesday evening, members voted unanimously to distance themselves from their councillor colleague’s views.

Bizarrely, Mr Silvester also voted for the motion.

However, he took the floor at the meeting to refuse to resign and outspokenly called for gay people to seek repentance from God, adding that he stood by his earlier comments in the Henley Standard.

Mr Silvester was suspended and subsequently expelled from UKIP over his letter to the newspaper in which he warned David Cameron that 'natural disasters' would follow the passing of the same sex marriage Bill.

Speaking to a packed town hall chamber, Cllr Silvester said: 'Never was it my intention to insult the gay community and I certainly apologise to them if personal insult has been their perception.'

He added that his aim had in fact been to criticise the Government for passing the Bill and ignoring 'the national textbook, the Holy Bible.'

'I have read that I am barmy to connect this to the weather - if that is the case then I am in good company,' he said, citing senior bishops blaming floods on 'abandonment' of bible teachings.

'The Jesus I serve welcomes all possible types of person, whether straight or gay,' he said.

'All they have to do is come to him in repentance and faith.'

In 2007, The Right Reverend Graham Dow, Bishop of Carlisle, argued that the floods that year were a judgment on society’s moral decadence and the fact that 'every type of lifestyle is now regarded as legitimate.'

Cllr Silvester said he was exercising his right to free speech by writing to the newspaper, which he claims held back his letter for three weeks and added his political and town council affiliations.

'I have had endless support from all over the country and the world and have the confidence to stand by every word I wrote,' he said.

Mr Silvester wrote another letter to the Henley Standard in April 2012 in which he told David Cameron not to legalise gay marriage and warned of 'disasters' if he did

However, he conceded he will be 'more circumspect' in his views in future and said he intended to serve on the council for his full four-year term.

Several councillors spoke to distance themselves from his views but added that he had served Henley-on-Thames well, in voluntary roles at Oxfam shops, community groups and on the council.

Councillor Laila Meachin said: 'I would not support David’s resignation as I know he is a good councillor for Henley on Thames. However, I feel there is a huge danger in ostracising anyone, whether it is intended that way or not.'

Councillor Samantha Evans, in distancing herself from his comments, added: 'I am a Christian too and I have a sister who is homosexual and I lived through what she went through with homophobic comments, remarks and all sorts.

'Mostly fear and sometimes hatred comes from things that are not understood and not known about.

'To say that a section of our community - and whether they choose to get married or not is to blame for this - comes very close in my opinion to crossing the line between expressing an opinion and inciting hatred.'

In a 20-minute session for the public to speak, several residents also spoke of the need to protect free speech while others called for Mr Silvester’s resignation.

His wife, Eileen, said they had owned a caravan which up until last year was on a site run by a lesbian couple they 'loved and respected.'

'This is nothing to do with individuals, it is all to do with the fact that the word of God says marriage is for a man and a woman,' she said.

Sarah Butcher, who started a petition calling for his resignation which has reached 25,000 signatures, said: 'There is a huge gay community in Henley-on-Thames, which he represents to one degree or another, which has been incredibly upset and hurt by his comments.

'His comments only serve to make life more difficult for young people struggling with their sexuality.'

Edwin Denning said: 'Everybody has a right to their opinion in this country and it is very dangerous to start saying that is not the case and have people reprimanded for that.'

Lucy Thaxton added: 'If somebody put forward views that were as harmful to an ethnic community as those put forward about the gay community by Mr Silvester, we wouldn’t be having this discussion here today.'

However, John Street said: 'In the case of David Cameron’s decision to redefine marriage, I think that it is a shameful and wrong thing to do and takes no account of the constitution of this country. I support the councillor in his views.'

Mr Silvester declined to comment after the meeting.
