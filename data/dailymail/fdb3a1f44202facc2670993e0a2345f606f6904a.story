A man who cut through his arm to the bone in a chainsaw accident at work claims that he was turned away by two GP surgeries even though he was dripping with blood.

Larry Smith, 62, of Fairford, near Cirencester, Gloucester, was felling trees when the horrific accident happened.

He says that he ran to his closest surgery - Lechlade Medical Centre - but staff allegedly told him that they could not see him because he was not a registered patient.

Accident: Larry Smith sliced his arm to the bone with a chainsaw and was turned away from two doctors practices in Fairford, Gloucestershire

Cuts and bruises: Larry Smith eventually bandaged himself up at a local branch of Boots before driving 10 miles to hospital, where he needed 10 stitches

Mr Smith then drove himself to Hilary Cottage surgery, where 
he is a registered patient, but was allegedly turned away again because staff were
 too busy.

Despite being turned away from two doctor's office, Mr Smith knew that he needed urgent medical attention.

He said that he did not rush to the hospital straight away because he knew his wound needed to be bandaged first.

He said: 'Being a first responder I knew I'd done something serious to my arm. I also knew it was repairable but it needed immediate bandaging first.'

'I couldn't believe I was turned away. I was actually bleeding on their floor.'

He added: 'I finally went to Boots pharmacy and patched myself up. I then realised I shouldn't be driving so I got my wife to take me to the hospital.'

The couple drove 10 miles to Cirencester Hospital where Mr Smith was eventually seen.

Doctors attended to Mr Smith's wounds and gave him ten stitches. But he now has a long scar down his arm.

Lechlade Medical Centre and Hilary Cottage surgery were not prepared to comment on the matter this week.
