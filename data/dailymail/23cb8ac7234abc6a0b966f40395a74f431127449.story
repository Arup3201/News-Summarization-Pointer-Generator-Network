THE ex-girlfriend of TV  comedian Justin Lee Collins demanded £20,000 from him after their relationship ended, a court heard yesterday.

Anna Larke allegedly threatened to ‘hurt’ Collins and demanded money in return for not going to the police with her claims of physical and verbal abuse.

The accusations emerged during the trial of Collins for harassment at St Albans Crown Court.

Miss Larke, 38, has claimed the TV 
star forced her to produce a dossier of her sexual past and throw out 
DVDs with actors she might fancy after they moved in together.

The former PR worker also claims 
Collins slapped her, pulled her hair and spat in her face during the 
nine months they were a couple.

Sonia Woodley QC, defending Collins, 
claimed Miss Larke had bombarded him with 103 texts in a single day 
after they split in July last year.

At the time Collins – who found fame 
on Channel 4’s The Friday Night Project with fellow comedian Alan Carr –
was recording a show for a radio station.

Miss Woodley said: ‘You rang him on 
one occasion realising he was not going to come back. You said: “Give me
£20,000 or I’m going to hurt you and I’m going to go to the police”.

‘He said, “I’ve offered you all sorts of help but I’m not getting involved in blackmail”.

‘You wanted money. Is that what part of this case is about, Anna?’

Miss Larke replied: ‘I never said 
that. No, no, no. Oh my God, it’s absolute lies. If I wanted money I 
would have gone straight to the press. Why would I have put myself 
through all this?’

Miss Larke has admitted that before 
giving evidence, she told a police officer she would go to the PR guru 
Max Clifford if Collins was found not guilty. She said: ‘I’m not sure 
what I was thinking when I said that.’

Miss Larke also admitted that she had told Collins that a previous boyfriend had compared her behaviour to a ‘monster’s’.

Later the court heard from Miss 
Larke’s father Jeremy, who said his daughter had looked ‘haggard’ during
her relationship with Collins.

He said he had noticed ‘reddish’ marks
on her face and ‘bruises on her arms’ but she had been ‘evasive’ about 
how they had happened.

Miss Larke returned to her parents’ home in Hertfordshire after her split with Collins last summer.

Her father said: ‘She was completely torn apart, I would say. Completely irrational and torn apart.

‘She did say there had been some sort of fiery end to it.’

Miss Larke’s mother Penelope told the 
court her daughter had been ‘a bit thoughtful’ and ‘a little bit 
unhappy’ during her relationship with Collins.

She said: ‘He had a bad temper and 
everything had to be perfect. He was pressing her to tell him about her 
past. I told her it is nobody’s business. He told her, “If you don’t 
tell me you can eff off out of my house”.’

She also said her daughter had told her Collins had slapped her in the face on one occasion and grabbed her hair.

He also allegedly told Miss Larke to close down her Facebook account, stop using Twitter and abandon her email address.

The court was told he even banned her
from looking at other men, saying: ‘When you’re with me you look at the
****ing ground, you look at a tree... you don’t look at any other 
****ing human being.’

Miss 
Larke said he had abused her for being overweight calling her a ‘fat, 
****ing dog’ and said she was ‘riddled with cellulite’.

Under cross-examination, Miss Larke 
admitted Collins had showered her with gifts including a laptop, digital
camera and diamond ear rings.

She
also told how Collins had paid for her to take three months off work as
a Christmas present and had taken her on ‘expensive and luxurious’ 
holidays.

Asked why he 
had bought the computer, Miss Larke – who gave evidence from behind a 
curtain – said: ‘I imagine it’s because he was very guilty. He also 
abused my cat, he’s an animal abuser as well.’

Miss
Larke also claimed Collins bought her clothes, including a $1,000 
leather dress from New York, because he wanted to control what she wore.

Miss
Larke said Collins had given her ‘thousands’ of bruises’ and some could
be seen in pictures taken of them on holiday in Miami last year.

Despite
numerous visits to her GP, she said she had not shown the doctor her 
bruises because she did not want to get Collins into trouble.

A tearful Miss Larke said: ‘Justin was the love of my life. I still loved him. I’m not going to grass up my boyfriend.’

The jury of nine women and three men has heard Miss Larke went through menopause at the age of 36 and ‘despised herself’ 
because she couldn’t give Collins children, they were told.

Mrs Larke agreed Collins had been 
generous to her daughter – a bankrupt and recovering alcoholic – in 
giving her gifts and holidays to America.

She also claimed her daughter had not 
drunk during the relationship and bought a breathalyser device to prove 
she had not been drinking.

The court was also shown cards Miss 
Larke had written to Collins during their relationship. Part of one 
read: ‘My darling I missed you so much, I love you. I can’t be without 
you, please think about us both making small changes for an amazing life
together.’

A series of text messages between the 
two after their split were also read to the court. In one Collins said: 
‘I’m going to get the help I need my gorgeous girl. I am sorry I hurt 
you baby. I love you so much.’

Another said: ‘You walked out on me. You were supposed to worship me.’ 

Bitter feud: Collins allegedly repeatedly threatened Miss Larke, 38, and forced her to detail her sexual history

Miss Larke's father Jeremy today said she became ‘nervous’ and appeared to be ‘walking on eggshells’ when she started dating Collins.

He told the court she had stopped 
wearing make-up and started looking ‘haggard' and he had noticed a red 
mark on her face and bruising on the back of her arms.

Mr Larke said: 'I tried to ask her if she was okay and she would just fob me off.

'Eventually I noticed marks on her arms and her face. I questioned her about it but she dismissed it again.'

He
told jurors he did not know about the extent of some of her problems, 
including the fact she was diagnosed as being a chronic alcoholic prior 
to dating Collins.

'It’s all a great shock to me. I’m very upset about it, very upset,' he said.

Prosecutor Mr Shaw opened the case by saying that the relationship was 'characterised by this defendant exerting control over her, verbally abusing her and physically assaulting her.'

He went on: 'He engaged in a campaign of verbal and physical abuse against Ms Larke. He was very controlling of her and took a prurient interest in her past sexual history, which he then used against her, again and again in arguments and assaults against her.'

Collins, of Kew, south west London, denies the single charge of harassment by causing Miss Larke fear of violence.

The case continues.
