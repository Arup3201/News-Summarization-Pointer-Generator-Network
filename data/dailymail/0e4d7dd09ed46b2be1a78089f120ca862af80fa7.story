With that distinctive head of red hair and a cheeky smile, this looks like Prince Harry posing with a group of glamorous admirers.

But it won’t be giving Cressida Bonas any cause for concern.

These 12 American women are competing for the affections of an eligible young man they believe to be Prince Harry as part of a reality TV show.

Marry Harry: These are the 12 American women who are convinced that the Prince Harry impersonator they are competing to wed on TV is real Royal blood

Fooled: The women participating on the show will be under the impression that they are romancing Prince Harry - actually impersonator Matthew Hicks (pictured)

Fox TV’s I Wanna Marry ‘Harry’ follows
 the dopey dozen as they assemble in a grand English country house to 
fight for the chance to join the Royal Family.

But their host, 
unsurprisingly, was actually professional Prince Harry impersonator 
Matthew Hicks.

Publicity 
for the show, which is due to air in the US in May, reads: ‘Will he 
convince them he’s regal? And will they fall for the crown, or fall in 
love with the real him?’

I
 Wanna Marry 'Harry' will follow the single ladies as they
stay with the so-called prince at Englefield House in Berkshire.

Hicks will keep up the prince charade for the entire show, and only break the news about his real identity at the very end.

The show is being produced by Ryan Seacrest and ZigZag Productions and was put into development last August under the secret title 'Dream Date'.

It is in the same vein as Joe Millionaire, another dating reality show that aired in 2003.

On Joe Millionaire, the women were convinced that they were competing to marry Evan Marriott, the heir to a million-dollar fortune.

At the end of the series, the last two women were informed that Marriott was not a rich man, but just a working-class construction worker.

The woman who decided to stay with Marriott once his secret was spilled was rewarded with a surprise $1million dollars, and though the pair didn't last they did split the prize money.

Joe Millionaire was thought up by Fox producer Mike Darnell, who also ordered 'Harry' before leaving the network in May. The show will now be tun by British-born Simon Andreae.
