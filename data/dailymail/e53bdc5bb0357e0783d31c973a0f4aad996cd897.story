Arrest: Gordon Collins-Faunce told police he picked up his baby son by his head and threw him in a chair when he became overwhelmed caring for him

The grandfather of the ten-week-old boy who was beaten to death allegedly by his father last week wants to know why previous abuse was not flagged up by Child Protection Services.

Gordon Collins-Faunce, 23, from Maine, is accused of picking up baby Ethan Henderson by the head, squeezing his skull and throwing him so violently into a chair, he snapped his neck.

When Ethan arrived at the hospital, doctors noted he had older brain injuries andÂ  described him as a 'dirty child' with nappy rash and an unwashed belly button.

He died three days later from severe bleeding to the brain.

His mother, 23-year-old Christina Henderson, was at work at the time.

Irving Faunce - former mayor of Gardiner and Wilton selectman, and a health care consultant - wants to know why the family were not contacted or why CPS did not act.

'A report and follow-up could easily have prevented Ethan's death,' he told the Portland Press Herald.

He also made a promise to his grandson that he would not let anything like that happen again.

'My wife and I would do whatever we can do to make sure this doesn't happen again,' Mr Faunce said. 'I also promised that we would work on his behalf to make sure that those who should be accountable (for) what had happened to him are held accountable.'

Legislators also want answers. The Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee held a hearing on Wednesday to explore how the state Office of Child and Family Services responds to reports of abuse and what obstacles may inhibit its response.

After Collins-Faunce was charged with the murder, he admitted to detectives he had broken the boys arm because he became frustrated as he was changing his diaper.

He told doctors at the time the child had caught his arm in his crib.

Victim: Baby Ethan sustained severe brain damage and died three days later. His father also admitted he had previously broken his arm when he became stressed while changing his diaper

After Ethan's death, he admitted to police he became frustrated with the boy when he started crying.

'He said he stood up straight and held Ethan by the head with both hands for "one minute max",' the police affidavit said.

'He then hurled Ethan into a chair in the living room, seeing the boy's head snap back as he landed. On a scale of one to ten, he estimated his force to be eight or nine,' the affidavit read.

Grandfather: Irving Faunce wants to know why CPS did not do anything when baby Ethan was treated for a broken arm last month

He has been charged with depraved indifference murder and is being held on $100,000 bail in the York County Jail.

Friends told the Press Herald that Collins-Faunce had been targeting Ethan, and that his girlfriend had never known.

'He's been targeting Ethan and she just didn't realize it,' Nicole Tucker said.

Officials are refusing to comment on the case citing confidentiality laws and the fact it is an open, ongoing investigation.

Sue Hadiaris, a spokeswoman for Southern Maine Medical Center, said: 'There is an investigation that's open right now. There's not any way we would be able to make any kind of a comment about where Ethan received his care or the care he received.'

A Department of Health and Human Services worker told police that a daycare provider reported that Ethan's half sister, three, had come to daycare 'covered in bruises'.

It is not yet clear if any action was taken following this report.

According to the Portland Press Herald, Irving Faunceadopted Gordon Collins-Faunce and his two sisters when Gordon was eight years old and had been in a succession of foster homes.

He was said to have been sexually and physically abused and was taking medication for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Faunce - an administrator at a nursing home in Penobscot - said he wants to understand where mistakes were made and how to correct them, so that what happened to his grandson doesn't happen to anyone else.

He said: 'I work in the health care business. I'm very aware of mandated reporting. It just strikes me how an infant could go through having a fractured arm and have it seen by two physicians and it didn't go to someone.'

The DHHS rarely comments on cases involving child abuse and neglect, citing a state law that requires it to keep much of its child protective information confidential.

Anger issues: Collins-Faunce was discharged from the military after he held a knife to a roommate's throat

The affidavit also noted that Collins-Faunce has been taking medication for post-traumatic stress disorder as he was physically and sexually abused as a boy by various foster parents.

He told police he was discharged from the military after he held a knife to a roommate's throat and had been an alcoholic throughout 2010 but had since stopped drinking.

His medication for post-traumatic stress disorder had recently changed, and he was having trouble sleeping. But Tucker said his new mood stabilizers seemed to be worked.

'The day this happened, he didn't take his meds,' she said.

Collins-Faunce is being held in the York County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail.

The other two children were removed from the home but Henderson is now petitioning to have them returned now her fiance is out of the house.
