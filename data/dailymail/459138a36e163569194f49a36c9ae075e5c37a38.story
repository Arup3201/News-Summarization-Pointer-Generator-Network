Boss: Antonio Horta-Osorio, chief executive, of Lloyds Banking Group went on a month's sick leave after being diagnosed with fatigue and stress due to overwork

Bankers at bailed-out Lloyds relaxed from the strains of Britain's worst economic downturn for a century by escaping to a luxury spa.

A dozen senior executives were sent on breaks at Champneys to show them how to be better 'hunter-gatherers in the corporate jungle', it emerged today.

The resort, more commonly associated with Premier League footballers and celebrities, created a 'bespoke programme' to protect the bosses from 'bail out, burn out or being booted out'.

The executives were advised on the latest techniques used in 'physique management', the skills needed to be 'alpha males and females' and even anti-ageing methods.

It is unknown how much the break at Champneys' Tring resort in Hertfordshire cost, but comparable stays start at £995 per person.

The shocking revelations will outrage millions of hardworking Britons, who learnt the grim news this week that the UK has plunged into the first double-dip recession since 1975.

Lloyds Banking Group, which is around 40% owned by the UK taxpayer, to whom it owes about £20 billion, sent staff on a two-day trip intended to show them how to 'manage their chaotic lives', the Guardian reported.

Tim Bean, the celebrity trainer, instructed the 12 bankers about the 'little-known, but highly effective methods of the UK's leading physique and corporate longevity specialists'.

He gave the 12 bankers tips on 'executive nutrition' and devised a workout programme for each of them.

Mr Bean, who uses the nickname 'The Merciless Mr Bean', revealed one seminar called Hunter-Gatherers in the Corporate Jungle was arranged to 're-equip them with the skills of alpha males and females'.

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, told MailOnline: 'Taxpayers are still picking up the pieces from bailing out the banks.

'Bosses at those institutions cannot carry on living the high life when it’s taxpayers who are propping them up.

'Lloyds chiefs should focus on paying back what they borrowed rather than spending their time on corporate spa breaks.'

A spokesman for Lloyds said: 'It is important to stress that this was a free one-off event that a small group attended last year at the request of a customer who wanted feedback on a new programme they planned to launch.

'It was arranged by a senior executive who no longer works for the group.'

But Stephen Purdew, chief executive of Champneys, told the Guardian: 'Of course they bloody paid for it.'

The bankers arrived at the Tring spa, which is surrounded by 170 acres of parkland, on November 3 - the day after Antonio Horta-Osorio, the Lloyds' chief executive, went on a month's sick leave after being diagnosed with extreme fatigue and stress due to overwork.

As part of his treatment, Mr Horta-Osorio checked into the Priory clinic, where he slept under constant medical supervision for eight days and nights.

The Lloyds bankers got up at 6am on November 4 to attend a 'dawn-breaker exercise class' and later went to a 'build before you burn' session, which advised them not to take on heavy workloads in a rush.

At the end of the day, they were encouraged to 'de-stress or detox' in the spa, where they were able to choose from more than 100 'relaxing, energising and rejuvenating' treatments.

The names of the Lloyds employees have not been disclosed but Mr Bean said they were an 'executive team'.

It is not the first time that a stay at Champneys has landed somebody in the public eye in hot water.

Sir Paul Stephenson quit as commissioner of the Metropolitan Police after it emerged he accepted £12,000 of free hospitality from Champneys.

At the time, Neil Wallis, the former News of the World executive editor arrested in connection with the phone-hacking scandal, had been working as a PR consultant for the spa.

Last December, it emerged Lloyds sent ten bosses to comedy school to brush up on their leadership skills.

The bank signed up for a two-day workshop with The Comedy School in London, as part of a six-month training scheme for department heads.

Among the courses offered by the school, from around £75 per person for a half day, were improvisation classes and lessons in clowning.
