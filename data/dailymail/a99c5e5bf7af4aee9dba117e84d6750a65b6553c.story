He was one of Hollywood's finest comic talents raking in almost $10m per film at the height of his fame. 

But Chevy Chase, 71, looked a shadow of his former self when he appeared at the 40th anniversary of the Saturday Night Live show. 

In an excruciating interview with Carson Daly, Chase wiped sweat from his brow and made a garbled and confused speech to the TV anchor.

A plump Chevy Chase made a confused and awkward interview while at the 40th anniversary of SNL

At the height of his career, Chase was one of America's most popular comedians and a visible celebrity

Chase, whose real name is Cornelius, rose to fame as an original member of the SNL crew in 1975

Chase, who was part of the original Saturday Night Live crew in 1975, said: 'I left after the first year because I thought this isn't going anywhere... I liked [hosting]. I liked it. 

'But I missed it more for not being a part of the cast because I left after one year, I had reasons to leave. 

'I'm sorry if I'm perspiring, but I just had to run through a gauntlet. But I liked it a lot, and I still like it. I love Lorne (Michaels, the creator of the show). We're like brothers now.' 

Following the toe-curling chat on the red carpet, viewers on Twitter commented on the 'awkward' interview saying it was one of the most cringe-worthy things they had ever seen.

They also mocked Chevy's famous catchphrase 'I'm Chevy Chase...and you're not' which he used during the Weekend Update segment of SNL. 

One quipped: 'He's Chevy Chase and I'm not, thank God'. 

Viewers watching the 40th anniversary celebrations took to Twitter to comment on the cringe-worthy chat

Kevin Negandhi, from ESPN, remarked on the 'weird' interview and said he hoped Chase 'is OK' 

After rising to fame on SNL, Chevy - whose real name is Cornelius - embarked on a highly successful movie career in such hit comedies as Caddyshack, Three Amigos! and National Lampoon's Vacation.

In the late 1980s, Chase, a father-of-three, earned around $7m per film.  

More recently, he campaigned for Democratic candidates Bill Clinton and John Kerry during Presidential Election races.  

He famously referred to George Bush as an 'uneducated, real lying schmuck dumb f***' during the 2004 Election. 

In 2012, Chase abruptly left the sitcom Community after a public feud with Dan Harmon, the show's creator and former executive producer.

Messages Chase left on Harmon's voicemail surfaced online, revealing the actor's dissatisfaction with the direction he felt the show was taking.

In one message the actor was heard saying Community was a 'mediocre sitcom' and accused Harmon of not understanding 'what it is I do that's funny'.
