Watford have signed Mexico international Miguel Layun on loan from Granada.

The versatile defender only joined Granada on Wednesday from Club America and signed a five-year deal but he has been sent on loan to Vicarage Road for the rest of the season.

Layun, 26, has 22 caps for his country and also has a Spanish passport. He can play left-back or right-back.

Layun started his career with Veracruz before moving to Serie A outfit Atalanta. He returned to his home country for the 2009/10 season to join America.

'Thank you to the board of directors and Club America for all the support you've offered me,' Layun wrote on his Twitter account. 

'This will be a new challenge and a dream to strive for.'

Watford now have seven loanees in their squad but only five can be used on a matchday.
