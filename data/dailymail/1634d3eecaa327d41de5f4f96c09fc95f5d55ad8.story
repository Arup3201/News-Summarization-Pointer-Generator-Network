Jordan Henderson had never been beaten as Liverpool captain. He had won eight, drawn one, and lost none, yet Sod's law dictated that record had to be ended by their great rivals.

Liverpool lacked a leader in the first half, prompting Brendan Rodgers to bring Steven Gerrard on at half-time, and Henderson handed him the armband, as per.

No sooner had Gerrard put it on his left bicep than he had to give it back, as he was sent off after just 38 seconds, and his deputy led Liverpool in their first Barclays Premier League defeat of 2015.

It was in June 2012 that Henderson received criticism, namely from Joey Barton, after being selected in England's squad in place of the injured Frank Lampard. 'If Henderson got in,' Barton wrote, 'any Englishman not currently in the squad has to feel aggrieved.'

Sir Alex Ferguson echoed that in 2013, writing in his book that the midfielder ran from the knees.

Henderson is a different animal these days, however. Thierry Henry deems his transformation 'truly unbelievable', while England manager Roy Hodgson calls it 'meteoric'.

He has grown into a leader and was preferred in the starting XI to Gerrard - the man that scored twice and celebrated by kissing the camera at Old Trafford in March 2014. 

Yet that authority was absent amid a dire first 45 minutes. United, with Angel di Maria on the bench, were all over the team that had not been beaten in the Premier League since December 14.

By the 20th minute, Liverpool had one shot to their name - an effort from Daniel Sturridge that never troubled David de Gea. The visitors had 64.8 per cent possession, too. One-sided, to say the least.

Even by the 30th minute, goalkeeper Simon Mignolet had more touches than Henderson. 

It wasn't working against Louis van Gaal's quite brilliant team, and a change was needed.

Liverpool had lost the four previous games in the Premier League when trailing by half-time, and Gerrard emerged from the tunnel, kitted with the captain's armband already on.

His stamp on Ander Herrera meant they would be the underdogs for some 44 minutes, and Henderson could sense his unbeaten record  was about to end. Liverpool, to their credit, battled like a team that had not been beaten since late 2014.

Yet  it was too little, too late, even after Daniel Sturridge gave them a glimpse of hope. That goal in the 69th minute was their first shot on target, but they could not find a second.

Henderson, then, has become Gerrard's natural replacement, and will be required for the next three games against Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United in his absence.
