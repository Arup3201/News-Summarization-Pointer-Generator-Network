Passengers travelling Tigerair Australia and Jetstar should be prepared to pay a fee of up to $85 if carry-on exceeds 10 kilograms, following recent crack-down warnings from the two arch-rival airlines. 

Tigerair Australia will begin tighter measures for carry-on bags from September 18, after eight months of warning passengers not to exceed its baggage limits.

Now anyone who does not abide by Tiger's free of charge carry-on baggage limit of 10 kilograms, will incur a $70 fee for a flight less than 1 hour and 45 minutes, or $85 for a longer flight, and if your baggage exceeds 15 kilograms, expect to pay even more.

Passengers have the first three months of the crackdown, to get used to the strict fees, with the airline allowing a 40 per cent discount of the penalty, before full fees kick in.

Since the start of the year, Tiger has began positioning extra staff at departure gates, policing carry-on limits and issuing warnings to anyone that did not adhere, Sydney Morning Herald reported.  

'From now on we are simply asking all passengers to play by the rules as there will be increased monitoring and the risk of a penalty charge for those that ignore them,'  said Tiger commercial director Adam Rowe.  

A customer service officer from Jetstar told Daily Mail Australia that staff at Jetstar has been told to look out for people who try to avoid oversized baggage penalties. 

'Passengers regularly try to trick staff and avoid  paying for bags that exceed limits.

'Now we are watching out for anyone that tries to work the system and unfortunately for the ones who do, they will have to pay the price.'

Jetstar has also announced it will be cracking down on cabin baggage limits.
