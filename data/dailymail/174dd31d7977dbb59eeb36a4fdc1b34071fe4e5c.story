This distressing last photograph of a dying mother of four crawling on a hospital floor in agony shocked the nation.

Margaret Lamberty’s family complained she was ignored by medics and left to die in a side ward.

Despite their pleas for an apology, the Royal Stoke University Hospital refused to admit any wrongdoing in the run-up to the 45-year-old’s death.

Almost a year on, however, a damning report has confirmed that the family’s complaints were justified – and the hospital has been forced to say sorry.

Shocking: Margaret Lamberty, who was pictured crawling on a hospital floor in agony, was overlooked by medics, a report has revealed

Mrs Lamberty, pictured with her eldest daughter Laura in 2012, died after doctors missed a treatable blood clot in her stomach

The independent report revealed that Mrs Lamberty was indeed repeatedly overlooked by medics who were ‘too busy’ to treat her.

It found she died as a result of a treatable blood clot in her bowel that was missed due to ‘substandard management’, including a lack of record-taking.

The results are vindication for Mrs Lamberty’s family who, following her death on April 30 last year, said: ‘Mum was failed by the doctors and the nurses. We are determined to get justice.’

Mrs Lamberty, who was a divorced grandmother of eight, was taken to casualty by her family with chronic stomach pain on April 27 last year.

She was left for two hours with her pain registering a maximum score on a medical scale until she was finally given drugs to ease her distress, the report said.

Mrs Lamberty is said to have crawled out to reception to plead for painkillers after staff told her daughter she could only have paracetamol

Staff at the hospital failed to check whether the medication was effective in the days up to her death, despite her pleas for a re-examination.

At around 6pm, after Mrs Lamberty had been at the hospital for nine hours, her eldest daughter, Laura, 29, pressed an emergency buzzer as her mother screamed in pain.

Vindicated: Mrs Lamberty's daughter Laura said the hospital made her family appear as if they were 'liars'

She says she waited 30 minutes for assistance, but no one came to help, so she had to go to the reception desk to ask for more painkillers. Staff told her they couldn’t give her anything other than paracetamol. In desperation, her mother is alleged to have crawled on her hands and knees down the corridor to beg them for pain relief.

Mrs Lamberty’s family told staff of her history of blood clots but medics failed to carry out a scan that would have detected the clot until it was too late, stated the report drawn up by a senior nurse and doctor.

And when nurses sought to have her condition reassessed, she was denied an examination by senior doctors. Instead, Mrs Lamberty was left in a side ward. The report found her intestinal condition was ‘notoriously difficult to diagnose’.

The stay-at-home mother left behind three other children: Sarah Lamberty, 27, Tony Hills, 19, and 14-year-old Gemma Riseley. Mark Hackett, the hospital’s chief executive, has issued an ‘unreserved apology’ and promised to learn from the mistakes. The hospital trust said the care given was unacceptable.

But speaking on behalf of her family, mother-of-five Laura, from Chell Heath in Staffordshire, said: ‘They have made us out to be liars but these reports back up everything we say.

‘I don’t want to talk to the hospital again and will take these reports straight to our solicitor.’

The case has been referred to the General Medical Council.

Mrs Lamberty’s death was the latest scandal at the hospital, built just three years ago at a cost of £400million.

Great-grandmother Lillian Baddeley, 81, died eight months after catching four superbugs. And two premature babies died after contracting a bug because staff did not wash their hands.
