One of Britain’s biggest banks has been fined £56million for an IT glitch which locked millions of customers out of the bank accounts - equivalent to £8.60 for every affected customer.

The record penalty on Royal Bank of Scotland has been levied by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, which imposed a £42million fine, and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, which fined the lender £14million.

Some 6.5million  customers of RBS, NatWest and Irish subsidiary Ulster Bank endured a week of chaos in June 2012 when a software upgrade went spectacularly wrong.

The ensuing IT meltdown left customers unable to make or receive payments, with many hit with hefty charges for breaching their overdraft limits and not receiving their wages.

The scandal has already landed RBS with a £175million bill to compensate customers and pay overtime to staff as the bank was forced to extend opening hours at branches to sort out the mess.

Former chief executive Stephen Hester forfeited his bonus of up to £2.4million over the fiasco at a bank which is still 81 per cent owned by the taxpayer.

The fine – which is the biggest ever for an IT failure – comes just days after RBS was one of six banks fined £2.6billion for rigging the £3trillion a day foreign exchange market.

RBS was hit with a £400million penalty by UK and US regulators, with regulators publishing damning transcripts of its traders bragging about the conspiracy.

The IT failure has raised concerns about the state backed lender’s creaking computer systems which have continued to let down customers in recent years.

RBS suffered another systems outage in December on the busiest online shopping day of the year, the third time in about 18 months that such a problem had prevented customers from using cards, cash machines and online banking services.

RBS bosses admitted previously they had failed to invest enough in their IT systems for decades, following a computer meltdown that hit millions of customers.

The extraordinary admission a after a string of glitches where millions of  debit card cash withdrawals and purchases, some credit card transactions, plus online banking and banking via mobile phone, were blocked.

RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said the most recent systems failure was ‘unacceptable’, and admitted: ‘For decades, RBS failed to invest properly in its systems. We know we have to do better.’ 

In 2012 a junior technician in India was blamed for causing the RBS computer meltdown which froze millions of British bank accounts. 

But it later emerged it came from their Edinburgh headquarters.

It says it has been ploughing billions of pounds into bolstering its IT systems to help ensure that similar problems do not reoccur.

The lender recently pledged to invest an extra £1billion in its digital and IT services as it attempts to persuade more of its customers to bank online and on their mobile phones.

But it has repeatedly denied reports that the problems in the summer of 2012 were caused by workers in the Indian city of Hyderabad, where it set up an IT support centre to cut costs.

The results of its internal investigation into the source of the failure have yet to be published as it waits for the FCA’s verdict.

Last night one expert suggested RBS has escaped lightly.

David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Given the size of the trangression and the damage caused to customers this fine is nothing more than symbolic.

We are talking about a bank which could not even get the basics right - stuff that affects people in their day to day life. It’s little wonder there is a complete lack of trust between banks and their customers.’

RBS declined to comment.

Before the 2008 financial crisis, Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world.

The bank was founded in Edinburgh in 1727, but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the City of London too as the UK capital became the world's leading financial centre.

RBS sealed its place at the top table of British banking in 2000 when it bought NatWest, which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the 'Big Four' retail banks in the UK.

Fred Goodwin, right, became chief executive of RBS the following year and pioneered a gung-ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division.

One of the biggest deals came when RBS joined a consortium to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro for £49billion, which was later revealed as a major overvaluation.

With the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil, RBS was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations.

The Labour Government felt it had no option but to step in, and in October 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for £37billion of new capital.

As the bank's losses spiralled and it required even more bail-out money, the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent.

Much of the blame for RBS's troubles was attributed to Goodwin, who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004.
