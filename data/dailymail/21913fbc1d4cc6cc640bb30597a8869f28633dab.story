With handsome, blue-eyed Jude Law as a 
father and sultry Sadie Frost as a mother, Rafferty Law has some of the 
best genes in the business.

And the 17-year-old proved himself to be the model son, when he made his catwalk debut at the DKNY menswear show in London on Sunday.

If that wasn't enough, the teen - who was first signed lead model agency, Select, back in October - 
has now made his glossy magazine debut in a cool new fashion spread.

He's headed for big things: It's been a good week for Jude Law's son Rafferty. The 17-year-old saw his star rise when he walked in DKNY on Sunday and now he's posing for a high fashion mag azine

Rafferty joins fellow male models Oliver Cheshire, True Blood's Giles Matthey and English judo athlete, Ashley McKenzie, for the black and white shoot in high fashion magazine, D Section.

The story was based around 'my hero' and the boys were invited to talk about their personal heros whether it be their fathers or musicians who have inspired them through their lives.

Sadly for A-list actor Jude, Rafferty didn't cite his father as his hero and instead opted for Joe Strummer from the Clash.

Like father like son: Rafferty was the first 
child he had with ex-wife Sadie Frost in 1996 and they share a physical 
resemblanceÂ

Raff, as he is known, goes on to explain that the musician's music and lyrics have inspired his own melodies.

'There have been all sorts of different musicians from different genres that have inspired and influenced my writing styles and technique,' he says.

'Joe Strummer is the most influential because of his image as a whole and the music he wrote and stood for is similar to what I'm trying to do with Dirty Harry's.'

Dirty Harry's is Raff's four-piece band, of which he is singer and guitarist. Although he's still studying, the band is his main passion and he and his bandmates are currently gigging around London.

Oliver Cheshire, who is dating Pixie Lott, cites his fireman father as his idol, while Giles Matthey chose his two best friends.
