CCTV footage that reveals the precise moment that Paul Walker's Porsche Carrera GT careered into a tree and burst into a flames has been released - as one witness claimed that the crash was an accident not a drag race.

Accident investigators 'have received eyewitness statements that the car involved was travelling alone at a high rate of speed' the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a written statement on Monday. 'No eyewitness has contacted the [department] to say there was a second vehicle.'

The surveillance footage shot from a nearby rooftop camera and obtained by OMG! Insider shows a plume of black smoke billow into the sky in the seconds after the crash, just moments before what appears to be a large detonation sends a huge fireball skywards.

Tribute: Fast & Furious star Vin Diesel spoke to crowds who'd gathered at the crash site

Heartfelt: Vin Diesel thanked the crowd 'for showing that angel up in heaven how much you appreciate him' 

On Monday Walker's Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel joined crowds who'd gathered to pay their respects.

Speaking through a police car loudspeaker, he said: 'If my brother were here right now and saw all the love that you're bringing here. If he could see for himself that all of you have showed up to show my brother love at this hard time. That his family gets to see all of you show the love that you've shown Paul. It's going to stay with me forever.

'I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for coming down here and showing that angel up in heaven how much you appreciate him. It's going to stay with me for ever.'

The footage of the deadly crash which 
claimed the lives of Walker, 40 and driver, Roger Rodas, 38, was 
released as images of the dramatic moment cops and emergency workers 
physically wrestled one of the Fast & Furious star's friends away
 from the scene also came to light.

And following the harrowing 
video and images, a professional driver who was at the charity show in 
Santa Clarita has come forward to claim that Rodas and Walker took their car out to check for a suspected mechanical issue and not for a joyride as has been claimed.

'As they were backing up the Carrera 
to put into the garage, it started stalling. I heard someone say, and I 
think it was Roger, "Why is the car stalling? Let’s take it around the 
block", the unidentified witness told Hollywood Reporter.

'Paul said, "Let me go with you really quickly".

'The whole premise of taking the car out for a drive was because something was wrong.'

The
 individual, who has declined to be named, said from his experiences with 
Walker and Rodas that the two were not likely to engage in a high-speed race
 with the Porsche Carrera GT - a car that is notorious for its handling 
issues at speed.

'These
 guys are business owners and Paul was a celebrity. They are responsible
 people. It was more like, "What the hell is wrong with this car? Let’s 
see what’s wrong and go for a drive".

'These guys were more like, "That’s weird, the car is stalling, let’s figure it out".'

The dramatic images from the minutes after the crash show how Walker's friends arrived on the scene and desperately tried to put out the flames with fire extinguishers and reach their friend.

However, it is alleged that the situation was so hopeless that one of Walker's friends named Nute was so upset at being held back that he punched a firefighter - but was not charged by Sheriff's afterwards according to TMZ.Com

The 30-second video clip, obtained by OMG! Insider, also appears to show that there were no other cars in front or behind of Walker's Porsche in the seconds before the crash - adding to claims that he was not involved in a high-speed drag race before the incident.

Instead, it shows cars eventually rush to the scene as friends and passersby heard about the wreck.

While investigators appear to have ruled out racing of any kind as they seek to determine the cause of the crash, video of Fast & Furious star Walker has emerged in which he boasts of driving at 185mph on a freeway.

The tragic actor made the boast on the GT Channel in 2011, while he was test-driving a Nissan GT-R in Japan.

'The fastest I've ever gone is 184 to 186,' Walker says on the video as he then reveals his top speed on a legitimate racetrack is actually less.

This comes as law enforcement look into the possibility that speed was a factor in Saturday's deadly crash - although it was Rodas and not Walker who was driving the Porsche super-car at the time.

In fact the impact from the crash was so fierce that debris from the Porsche destroyed parts of a landscape garden and shattered windows of buildings hundreds of feet away.

A property manager for a complex located more than 100ft from the scene told radaronline.com that the crash hit the building where he works.

'Debris flew down the hill into our parking lot,' said Melvin Termain. 'A tree got broken, it messed up a little of the landscaping.

'Debris flew up and hit the window in the furthest unit'.

The Fast & Furious star spoke to gathered crowds through a police car loudspeaker.

He said: 'If my brother were here right now and
 saw all the love that you're bringing here. If he could see for himself
 that all of you have showed up to show my brother love at this hard 
time. That his family gets to see all of you show the love that you've 
shown Paul. It's going to stay with me forever.

'I
 just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for coming down here and 
showing that angel up in heaven how much you appreciate him. It's going 
to stay with me for ever.'

The witness who spoke to the Hollywood reporter said that the fire was already burning when he and the star's friends arrived to try and battle the blaze.

'There were pieces of the car that flew into the parking lot next to the tree. Also, the front fascia of the building next to the crash was about three stories tall and made of glass,' said the driver to the Hollywood Reporter.

'I looked up and saw the crash broke the window at the top of the building.

'I thought, 'That must have been a sizeable crash.'

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Richard Cohen had told CNN that authorities received a phone call tip on Sunday suggesting that another car was at the scene when the Porsche slammed into a light pole and burst into flames. The crash site was reportedly a popular site for drag racing.

But after Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station traffic investigators ruled out a second vehicle at the crash the probe will now center on the speed of the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, driven by Paul's racing team partner and friend Roger.

Indeed, as a security tape put up on TMZ shows the massive fiery moment of impact - and the website reports: 'There appears to be no other cars either immediately in front of or behind the Porsche at the time of the crash.'
