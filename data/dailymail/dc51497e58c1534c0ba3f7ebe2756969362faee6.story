Milos Raonic remains in contention as the race for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals hots up after he made it through to the second round of the Swiss Indoors in Basle.

The Canadian fourth seed powered down 12 aces to push his way past American Steve Johnson 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 and maintain the momentum of a career-best season with a 44-16 match record.

Raonic, who now moves up to ninth place in the race to London just behind British number one Andy Murray, admitted that he found it tough in the opening set against Johnson.

'I really just stuck around in that first set,' Raonic told the ATP Tour website. 'I made the most of my opportunities in the tie-break.

'I felt I was getting a little bit better and better. Obviously I need to get significantly better for my next match, but I feel like I'm on the right track.'

He will face American Donald Young next and he remains on course for a potential quarter-final meeting with Rafael Nadal if they both win their next two matches.

Swiss third seed Stan Wawrinka suffered his third successive first-round defeat in front of his home fans in Basel as he was beaten 6-4, 6-7 (1-7), 6-3 by Mikhail Kukushkin. 

Wawrinka made 23 unforced errors in the first set to gift the world No 84 the advantage, but the Swiss star could still have recovered after coming within two points of taking it himself at 5-4.

Kukushkin held his nerve to see out the danger on his serve and claim the set, before Wawrinka hit back in the second with a dominant performance in the tie break.

Thoughts that Kukushkin may fold at that point were dashed when he took a 3-0 lead in the decider and, although Wawrinka came back into it, he managed to claim the victory in two hours and 15 minutes.

Eighth seed Ivo Karlovic's serve was too hot to handle for Lukas Rosol as the Croatian hit 23 aces on his way to a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 triumph. 

Qualifer Kenny De Schepper is next up for Karlovic after the Frenchman beat Federico Delbonis 7-6 (7-3), 7-5.

Elsewhere, Benjamin Becker cruised to a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Portuguese qualifier Gastao Elias, Ivan Dodig emerged victorious from a titanic battle with Marco Chiudinelli 6-4, 6-7 (7-9), 6-4 and Vasek Pospisil overcame Jarkko Nieminen 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4.
