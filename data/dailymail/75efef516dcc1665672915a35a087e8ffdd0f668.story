The Islamic State's affiliate in Egypt has released a video purporting to show the beheading of eight Bedouin men it accused of working for the Egyptian and Israeli armies.

The video, posted on the group's Twitter account late on Monday, also showed what it said were victims of Egyptian military operations in the restive Sinai Peninsula.

An insurgency there has killed scores of policemen and soldiers. 

The Islamic State's affiliate in Egypt Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis has released a video purporting to show the beheading of eight men it accused of working for the Egyptian and Israeli armies. The group last year posted a similar video (above) in which four men, accused of being Israeli Mossad spies, were executed

The jihadist group, known as Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis before pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group last November, has released footage in the past showing the execution of alleged informants.

In the latest video, masked militants in camouflage behead eight men, some of them in broad daylight at a major thoroughfare in north Sinai.

The men were first made to confess they worked for the armies of Egypt and Israel, which borders the Sinai and have been attacked by militants from the peninsula several times over the past three years.

It came as suspected Islamist militants set off five bombs in Egypt's second city Alexandria today and air raids afterwards in the Sinai Peninsula killed 15 suspected extremists.

It was not clear if the air raids in Sinai were in retaliation for the Alexandria blasts. Military officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

Three blasts near police stations in eastern Alexandria wounded 10 people, while two other bombs went off in the area without casualties, said Major General Amin Ezz al-Din, an assistant interior minister for Alexandria.

Later on Tuesday, 15 suspected militants were killed and eight others wounded in air raids in the Sinai town of Sheikh Zuweid, security sources said.

Security sources also said a two-year-old boy was in critical condition after being wounded in clashes between militants and the army south of the border town of Rafah near the Gaza Strip.

Frequent small-scale attacks such as the bombings in Alexandria have hurt Egypt's efforts to project an image of stability after four years of turmoil triggered by the 2011 Arab Spring uprising.

Egypt hosts an investment conference next month in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh in the southern Sinai Peninsula, and hopes to attract funds to turn around an economy battered by instability.

The Egyptian affiliate of Islamic State, the militant group controlling large parts of Syria and Iraq, claimed responsibility for attacks on security forces in Sinai late last month that killed at least 30 people.

Sinai's Islamist militants have stepped up their attacks on security forces since the army toppled president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 after protests against his rule.

Egypt has launched a crackdown in Sinai in response and systematically repressed Muslim Brotherhood supporters and other political opponents across the country.

The Brotherhood, which says it is committed to peaceful activism, has accused the military of staging a coup and curbing freedoms won in the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak.

The government says it is committed to democracy and faces a long battle against militancy.
