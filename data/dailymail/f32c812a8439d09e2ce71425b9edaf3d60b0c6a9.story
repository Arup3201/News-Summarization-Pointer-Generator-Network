Brussels was the butt of further mockery today after unveiling an 'official sash' for the European Parliament.

The golden-tasselled cloth ribbon, emblazoned with the EU flag, was announced via an email sent to MEPs yesterday.

Europhile members of the public can also buy the azure sash for an eye-watering £107.

The new European sash  can be bought by members of the public for £107, but has been ridiculed by UKIP MEPs

The revelation that the EU is developing its own Parliamentary uniform, comes after UKIP MEPs turned their backs on the European anthem at the opening of the new EU Parliament.

When the new parliament met in Strasbourg last week, it was officially opened with a military ceremony conducted by the Franco-German Eurocorps battle group.

To Nigel Farage's fury, the battle group raised the European flag to Beethoven's Ode To Joy - the EU's official anthem.

Paul Nuttall, Ukip's deputy leader, ridiculed the development.

He said: 'These people are so pompous they are beyond parody. Just how silly would you feel walking about town in an official European Parliament Sash?

'I can safely say they will not become the must-have fashion item this season.'

But the new European sash was defended by European officials - many of whom want to see more pomp and ceremony in Brussels.

'Why shouldn't our MEPs dress up too? This is the world's first transnational parliament and it is special,' an official told the Telegraph.

An email obtained by the newspaper read: 'Please note that the design of the sash was made in agreement with the Protocol Service of the EP. In this regard, this is considered to be the official EP sash.'

The official piece of clothing, made by the Mauquoy Medal Company, is available at www.epsash.eu.

Nigel Farage and other UKIP MEPs turned their back as an orchestra performed the official European national anthem in the EU parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday July 1

The development comes after Mr Farage accused MEPs of descending into 'naked militarism' by 'goosestepping' the EU flag around Brussels at the opening of the Parliament earlier this week.

The UKIP leader said European leaders were ignoring growing euroscepticism across the continent by pushing ahead with 'ever closer union'.

In his speech Mr Farage said the Prime Minister's humilating defeat trying to block Jean-Claude Juncker from becoming Commission President proved that Britain would not be able to renegotiate its position in the EU.

He said Mr Cameron was 'whistling in the wind' because the master of Europe was Germany's Angela Merkel who was not going to give way.

Mr Farage said: 'He ran into the new golden rule of EU politics which is when Mrs Merkel speaks the other member states obey.'

He added: 'What have we seen in the last 24 hours? We've seen naked militarism, with the EU flag being virtually goosestepped around the yard, we've seen the European anthem.'

Mr Farage's controversial speech today came after he was accused of 'shocking disrespect' for turning his back on the EU's national anthem as the European Parliament was opened in France.

Mr Farage met the new Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels this week. The former Luxembourg PM said freedom of movement within the EU was not up for negotiation

But Mr Nuttall said: 'We don't recognise or respect the EU flag or anthem. They are both symbols of our servitude inside a political union which the British people reject.

'We will do everything we can in European Parliament to oppose the Federalist system which ignores our national democracy and pushes millions of people across Europe into poverty and unemployment. We stand up for our people, not the EU flag and anthem.'

But Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder criticised the UKIP MEPs for their 'shocking disrespect' during the opening ceremony, describing their actions as "rude'.
