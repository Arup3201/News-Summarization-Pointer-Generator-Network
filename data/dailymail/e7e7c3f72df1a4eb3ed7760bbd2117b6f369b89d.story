On the run: Hans Mills ditched his son, 10, who is fighting cancer, and a 14-year-old Down Syndrome daughter, to flee Canada

A Canadian father-of-four has been dubbed the 'world's worst dad' after he 'abandoned' his children for a new life in the Philippines.

Hans Mills ditched his ten-year-old cancer sufferer son Steven, daughters Jackie, 14, who has Down Syndrome and Maggie, 17, who is fighting depression, and his eldest boy, a 19-year-old drug addict.

The 53-year-old education software expert said a court ruling which made him pay $4,000 a month to his ex-wife in child support would financially ruin him.

And so, with extensive work contacts in South East Asia, he sent his former love Donna Mills an email saying he had left the country for good.

He wrote on November 2, 2011: 'The result of the legal instrument you recently designed and implemented is there's no possibility of a comfortable life or (secure) retirement for me in Canada at all.

'Therefore I have left the country to seek greener pastures elsewhere, and will never return. Well done Einstein. Good luck and goodbye.'

It saw him join the legion of 120,000 parents in Ontario wanted for being in arrears on spousal and child support payments.

Speaking to thestar.com from his new Manila home, he said he blamed a 'broken' Family Court system that 'forced him to cut and run'.

He said: 'I did a terrible, awful thing, because I had no reasonable option. I miss my children terribly. I abandoned Canada, but not my children.

'My hope is some day I reconcile with my children, but not in Canada, a morally bankrupt state. The Philippines is about as far as I could go.  If I'd a spaceship I’d be much further away.'

He said his children were 'innocent bystanders who got caught in the crossfire' and added that it was 'not my intention to hurt them'.

He also revealed he would 'never, ever, ever, ever' pay spousal support nor return to Canada. It is a blow for his ex-wife, who has spent eight months trying to get Ontario's Family Responsibility Office to find him.

She told thestar.com: 'Financially, emotionally, physically, and spiritually, I am approaching bankruptcy. If I go down, the kids go down, and I can't let that happen.'

The trouble began when the couple split in 2005. After a two-day trial, they agreed Mrs Mills would have sole custody of the children and stay in the $1.2million Lake Ontario house.

He would pay child support, and she would pay $175,000 to buy him out of the house, which had a $600,000 mortage on it. She would also receive $2,000 a month in rent from a separate flat.

But Donna later said she was 'rushed and
 pressured and did not read' before signing, and that she did not 
understand she would never receive any future spousal support.

Mr
 Mills said: 'Donna got the million dollar lakefront mansion and full 
custody of the children with child support, but no spousal support, in 
exchange for the house.

'Everyone at the time agreed that my spousal support obligation had been met fully.'

The
 feud grew for several years until a new trial was scheduled for autumn 
2011 after Mr Mills had reportedly tried to take his ex-wife to court 
three times.

She decided to 
use it as an opportunity to ask a court to grant her spousal support. 
This was granted before the trial when, in June 2011, a judge issued a 
temporary order for the payments.

He also awarded her retrospective 
payments and court costs. Mr Mills left the country before the trial 
could take place. He now lives in Dasmarinas City, 30 miles south of 
Manila, with his new wife, former caregiver Rosemarie Espiritu.

He
 has since said his fleeing was a 'purely tactical response to an 
untenable situation' and accused his ex of using their son Steven's 
cancer as a 'weapon' against him.

He
 said that, as far as he knew, the disease was 'in check' and that their
 eldest son, who is being treated on a methadone programme, was now an 
adult and so not a dependent.

And he said that he was not 'in greener pastures' by saying: 'I live in the Philippines for Heaven's sake.

'This
 is not a country club. I have to keep a loaded shotgun beside my bed at
 night in case of attack, of which there have been several.'

Former
 teacher Mrs Mills, a Danish immigrant with both a Canadian and European
 passport, in the meantime said she cannot work because of her 'onerous'
 family responsibilities.

And
 the situation looks unlikely to change as the Philippines is beyond the
 reach of Canadian laws, even though he owes $28,000 arrears and his 
debt is growing by $3,772 per month.
