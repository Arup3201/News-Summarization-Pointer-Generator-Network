This is the astonishing moment an illegal immigrant jumped back into the water after he was rescued attempting to cross from Africa into Spain in a rubber dinghy.

The man was part of a seven-strong gang who made the dangerous crossing from Tangier in Morocco to Tarifa in Spain in the flimsy inflatable raft.

After getting into difficulty in the choppy sea, a ferry had to rescue them from the dangerous waters.

Cold: Despite being captured, the group of seven men can count themselves lucky that they did not lose their lives

Police and customs officials 
were soon called out to the ferry to detain the men. But as these 
incredible pictures show, so desperate was one of the gang to avoid 
capture, he jumped straight back into the sea. He was eventually rescued
 and detained by police officers.

Despite Europe's financial crisis, illegal immigrants continue to attempt 
to enter Europe through the Spanish coast in the hope of a better life.

Just this year alone, more than a thousand would-be immigrants have been rescued by 
Spanish authorities while trying to cross the Strait of Gibraltar from 
Morocco to Spain.

They often carry out the dangerous journey on small boats known as 'pateras' - completely aware that their lives are at risk.

In a sign of how desperate many of the men are to improve their lives, an oar used by one of the captured illegal immigrants says  'You won't be humiliated anymore. Don't be afraid, you won't be dishonor again. You will forget humilation'.

Since 1988, more than 20,000 immigrants have died on attempted crossings
 to the Andalusian or Canary Island coasts and many others are missing.

Earlier this year, police in Spain arrested a suspected illegal immigrant found clinging onto the engine of a powerful catamaran ferry on its way to Tarifa.

The shirtless man was stood over the propeller of the vessel, risking his life in the hope of entering Europe.

Police said they thought he planned to jump of the boat and swim to the coastline once near the mainland.

The
 port of Tarifa is notorious as an entry point for illegal immigrants. A
 grim sign of the fate awaiting many of those who attempted to cross can
 be seen by the port's mass grave . It contains nine bodies after the first reported would-be immigrants died attempted to cross into Spain in 1988.

It also contains a grave for Yacouba Cone, 26, from the Ivory Coast. He died on April 17, 2013 when his inflatable raft sunk while crossing the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco.
