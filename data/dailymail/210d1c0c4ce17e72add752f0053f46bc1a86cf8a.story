A woman who fell behind on  her yard work was sent to jail for not complying with city regulations regarding the maintenance of her overgrown lawn.

Karen Holloway, from East Tennessee, was cited by Lenoir City officials in June for not keeping proper maintenance of her yard.

She told WVLT-TV that while her yard was in dire need of attention and did look overgrown she did not think that it was a criminal offence.

Shock: Karen Holloway said her busy schedule was the reason that her yard had become overgrown

Back yard: Holloway admits that her yard, seen here, was in dire need of attention and did look shabby

Citation: In July, she received a citation from the city stating that she had broken the law under Section 302.1 of the City of Lenoir City Property Code which requires all exterior property to be maintained

The mother-of-two said her busy schedule and other personal family issues were the reasons that her yard became overgrown. 

She said: 'With my husband going to school and working full time, me with my job, with one vehicle, we were trying our best.

‘[The bushes and trees] were overgrown. But that’s certainly not a criminal offense.’

In July, she received a citation from the city stating that she had broken the law under Section 302.1 of the City of Lenoir City Property Code which requires all exterior property to be maintained.

It went on to suggest that she had not complied with the city's request for her to cut her grass under Section 302.4, which requires all grass to be cut to less than 12 inches. 

It meant Holloway faced jail, and on Tuesday, she turned herself in and made an appeal to city officials.

Grass: The city requests, under Section 302.4, that grass be cut to less than 12 inches

More time? Judge Vann has set up a follow-up hearing for Holloway in November to check on her  lawn

Judge Terry Vann initially handed her a five-day jail sentence, before amending it on Tuesday to just six hours. 

She said that she had offered to do five days of community service instead, but Vann refused her offer and said she should serve time behind bars.

The judge admitted that she is not a criminal and it was not a criminal case - making Holloway believe that she was being used as an example.

She said she felt 'bullied,’ and claims that she was not read her rights or told she could have a lawyer present.

She said: ‘It’s not right, why would you put me in jail with child molesters and people who have done real crimes because I haven’t maintained my yard up to the city’s standards?’ 

‘This opens a floodgate to everybody in Lenoir City being put in jail for silly things.’

Holloway said she has received several citations from the city  in the past while her husband was serving overseas in the military. But none of them turned out like this. 

Judge Vann has set up a follow-up hearing for Holloway scheduled for November to check on her progress and suggested that additional jail time may be added if the city is not satisfied with her lawn.
