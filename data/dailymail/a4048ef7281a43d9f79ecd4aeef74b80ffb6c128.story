Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's Anthony Byrne said women travelling to the middle east to become jihadi brides 'are being passed around as sex slaves after their partners are killed'

Australian women heading to Syria and Iraq as brides for members of the terrorist organisation Islamic State are being turned into sex slaves once their husbands die.

Intelligence information has revealed that a number of Australian women that travelled to Syria have suffered this fate, prompting officials to warn others against following in their footsteps, according to News Corp.

'Our information is that women are being passed around as sex slaves after their partners are killed,' Anthony Byrne, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's deputy chair told the Daily Telegraph.

'They are literally selling women for sex. Young Australian women should know that it's not an adventure… it's a slave trade.' 

It comes after a pamphlet outlining ISIS' 'laws' on sex slaves was released by The Research and Fatwa Department of the Islamic State.

Published in full by the Jihad and Terrorism Threat Monitor, the list of 'Questions and Answers on Taking Captives and Slaves' states that it is acceptable to have sexual intercourse with children, beat female slaves and sell them.

'It is permissible to buy, sell, or give as a gift female captives and slaves, for they are merely property, which can be disposed of as long as that doesn't cause [the Muslim ummah] any harm or damage,' the rules state.

'It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse; however if she is not fit for intercourse, then it is enough to enjoy her without intercourse.'

The list of prices that women are being sold at by the terrorist organisation was also made public by Iraqi News in November last year.

It revealed that girls between the ages of one and nine were priced at about 200,000 Iraqi dinars, just over $200.

Between 10 and 20-years-old, a woman is listed as being worth 150,000 dinars and from between 20 and 30 years they are sold for $100,000 dinars ($100 AU).
