When Portland Timbers were facing Seattle Sounders, the home side were keen to let the visitors know what they think of their fierce MLS rivals.

It all seemed innocent enough when a Wizard of Oz tifo began with a banner that read: 'There's no place like home.'

It soon turned sinister as Dorothy emerged, clutching a can of petrol, at the back-end of the yellow brick road which  led to a landscape of Seattle and its world-famous Space Needle on fire.

All looking normal: Portland Timbers fans during the game against main MLS rivals Seattle Sounders

It begins: The tifo emerges and a large banner that reads 'there's no place like home...' props up in the crowd

Not so innocent: A large Dorothy figure emerges holding a can of petrol at the end of the yellow brick road

Good match: Another banner showing Seattle and its Space Needle on fire emerges at the opposite end

Sadly for Portland, though, it did little as they lost the game 4-2 on Sunday despite their energetic display designed to get their players in the mood.

Newcastle fans may recall Obafemi Martins who, now with Seattle, bagged a brace during the win.

Nevertheless, those in Portland can be proud of coming out on top in the battle of the tifos.
