Mario Balotelli has his work cut out to impress new Italy manager Antonio Conte - a strict disciplinarian with little respect for reputations.

The new Liverpool signing had a disappointing World Cup for Italy this summer, and Conte has insisted that he will be picking players based on current form.

The former Juventus coach told Gazzetta dello Sport that, 'whoever joins the national team must then deserve to stay there.'

Point to prove: Mario Balotelli scored against England at the World Cup but had a disappointing tournament

New boss: Former Juventus manager Antonio Conte has taken charge of the Italian national side

Picked on merit: Conte has said Balotelli must prove himself again if he wants to make the Italy squad

Unsure: Conte said he wasn't sure Balotelli's decision to move back to England was a positive one

'The man is more important than the footballer... talent is secondary. First you've got to sacrifice yourself for the squad.'

Conte added that he wasn't sure Balotelli's decision to move back to England was a positive one.

Balotelli was heavily criticised in Italy after the Azzuri were  eliminated at the group stage of the World Cup, which prompted Conte's predecessor Cesare Prandelli to resign.

The Liverpool striker has a decent scoring record for Italy though, with 13 goals in 33 games, and will expect to keep his place in the Italy squad.
