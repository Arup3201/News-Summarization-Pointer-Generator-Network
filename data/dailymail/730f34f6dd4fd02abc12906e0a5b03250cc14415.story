An illegal migrant has finally been sent to prison a decade after killing an air hostess in a motorway smash.

Zahid Masood was driving at up to 90mph and talking on his mobile phone when he ploughed into 19-year-old Charlotte Smoker’s car.

But police allowed the 47-year-old to leave the scene of the November 2003 crash because he said he was suffering from shock.

Charlotte Smoker, 19, was killed after Zahid Masood, 47, drove into her at speed before fleeing police for years

He had given them a false name and quickly fled to his native Pakistan.

Incredibly, he returned to Britain 
under his true identity in 2007 – but used the false name again to start
a new life in Rochester, Kent, where he set up a temping agency and 
became a governor at his children’s school.

He was finally trapped last November 
when credit checks revealed his deception. He was arrested and charged 
with causing the crash.

Charlotte’s parents – Michele, 51, and
Ian, 52 – had had to make the devastating decision to turn off the life
support system keeping their daughter alive.

Mr Smoker, who served as an RAF 
engineer for 31 years, said Masood should be deported immediately to 
serve his sentence in Pakistan.

He was given four years for causing death by dangerous driving and nine months for perverting the course of justice.

Mr Smoker – from Basingstoke in  
Hampshire – said: ‘He only got nine months for perverting the course of 
justice, and we had nine years of struggle to come to terms with what we
lost that evening.

‘He was able to come and go from this 
country as he pleased, using a different name and passport and move on 
with his life – never paying for what he did.

‘Masood was able to set up a life for himself in this country, getting married and having children.

‘When police told him what he had done
the day Charlotte died he simply ran away with no regard for the 
consequences of his actions – no regard for our laws. As a family we 
want to see him deported back to Pakistan. We do not understand why he 
has been treated like a British citizen when he never behaved like one 
in the first place.

‘Why should he have the benefit of our taxpayers’ money and all the services we provide prisoners?’

Mr Smoker, who was on a posting in 
Cyprus with his wife on the day of the fatal crash in November 2003, 
said he would never get over it. ‘When we came back to the UK after the 
accident Charlotte was laid there on life support,’ he added.

‘Her mum and her sister painted her 
nails and we said our goodbyes. She was so young – she was incredibly 
bright, she was our blonde haired sparkly eyed girl and she was robbed 
from us.’

Privately-educated Charlotte was stranded in the outside lane 
of the M25 after she lost control of her Fiat after leaving Stansted 
airport in Essex, where she worked for Ryanair.

The court was told other cars swerved 
past her Cinquecento but Masood failed to see it because he had been 
travelling at speeds of up to 90mph in his Ford Focus while making 
business calls on his mobile.

Nearly one in five murder or rape suspects last year were born overseas, according to police statistics.

The figures show that 93 of the 555 murder charges in 2012 were laid against foreign nationals.

For the 3,436 rape cases, 632 of the accused were foreign nationals.

Many of the cases will still be making their way through the criminal justice system.

The only constabulary in the survey of 43 police forces in England and Wales not to have foreign citizens on its books for rape or murder was Dyfed-Powys in rural Wales.

Hampshire refused to reveal the nationalities of the eight foreigners it has charged with rape, saying it could lead to ethnic victimisation.

In London, more than a third of the 210 rape suspects charged in 2012 were from overseas.

Twenty-four were from Jamaica, 14 from Nigeria, 13 from Poland and ten from Portugal.

Of the 180 the Met charged with murder, 41 were foreigners, including seven from Jamaica and five from Turkey, Poland and Sri Lanka.

Following the crash police officers 
took down Masood’s details but allowed him to leave the scene to recover
from the ‘shock and trauma’ of the crash.

Within a year he was travelling back 
and forth between Britain and Pakistan on business. In 2007, he returned
to the UK using his real name and was given student status while 
working full time for his business, Universal Workforce.

Allister Walker, prosecuting, told 
Maidstone Crown Court that Masood had given the name Ahmed Mukhtar to 
police at the scene of the crash.

‘In fact, the defendant was an illegal
entrant into the United Kingdom. After the collision he left the United
Kingdom,’ he added.

‘He told police he returned after 
marrying his Romanian partner in 2007. This time he returned as Zahid 
Masood – his true identity.’

At the time of the crash, Masood, who 
was convicted by a jury, had no insurance and held only a provisional 
driving licence. He first came to Britain in 1999, using false papers. 
He was told he faces deportation when he leaves prison. Judge Philip 
Statman said: ‘You had no right to be on the motorway unsupervised as 
inevitably you were.

‘The telling feature in this case in 
my judgement is that you were distracted because you were using a mobile
phone to make a business call.

‘You made absolutely no effort on your
return to the United Kingdom to surrender to the authorities. You 
probably thought you had got away with it.’

Kent Police insisted last night it was not common procedure to arrest a driver at the scene of a collision.

‘We review all wanted person files and no case like this is ever fully closed,’ said Detective Constable Dave Holmes.

‘I am satisfied the Smoker family have finally been given some justice for their tragic loss.’
