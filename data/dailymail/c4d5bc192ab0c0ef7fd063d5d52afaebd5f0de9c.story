The son of singer Marvin Gaye is recovering at home after a successful kidney transplant and he has an appearance late last year on Entertainment Tonight to thank for finding a donor.

Marvin Gaye III appeared on ET in November after he filed a lawsuit against the writers of Robin Thicke's smash hit, Blurred Lines.

In the suit, filed in October, Gaye claimed that Blurred Lines was an illegal rip-off of his father's 1977 funk/disco classic Got to Give It Up.

When Gaye appeared on ET to discuss the lawsuit, his lawyer David Rudich also put out an appeal out for a new kidney for his client.

At that point Gaye had been receiving dialysis for renal failure for three years as a result of hypertension and diabetes.

A previous public appeal to find a donor hadnâ€™t met with any success, but his appearance on ET changed all that.

Rick Greene of Cincinnati came forward after being moved by Gaye's plea for help.

A spokeswoman for Gaye said he underwent surgery at UCLA Medical Center last week.

ET is currently preparing a follow-up segment to air in the coming weeks.

The lawsuit - which remains unresolved - also involved Thicke's co-writers Pharrell Williams and rapper T.I. (real name Clifford Harris Jr.).

Strangely, Gaye filed the claim to counter a suit filed last August by Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell in which they asked a judge to declare that the song did not infringe on Gaye's copy written work.

The original suit followed internet rumblings that the song bore a striking resemblance to Got to Give It Up.

 in first: Co-writers Pharrell, Robin and T.I. lodged a preemptive suit last August asking a judge to rule that they had not copied their hit

Attorney Owen Sloane explained why the plaintiffs filed first, saying, 'They wanted to do a preemptive move. There was a dispute and they could've waited to be sued, but it looks worse if they're on the defending side.'

According to Gaye, he may not have even pursued legal action had he not been sued first.

'It didn't even get to that point,' he said. 'They felt the need to jump the gun, so here we are.'

He said his lawsuit had one main objective, 'I want to see my father get credit for his work,' he said.
