A ban on books being sent to prisoners designed to stop smuggling of drugs and other contraband has today been criticised by the Chief Inspector of Prisons.

Nick Hardwick says the Government is trying to 'micromanage' Britain's jails and the restriction on reading materials should be 'considered a mistake'.

Pressure on Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to perform a U-turn is increasing daily, with even senior Tory colleagues calling the ban 'unenlightened'.

Disapproval: Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick, left, says banning sending of books to jails is a mistake, ramping up further pressure on Chris Grayling, right, to perform a U-turn

It was brought in as part of a new 
‘incentives and earned privileges’ regime introduced by the Ministry of 
Justice.

But it has led to a chorus of criticism, including from some of Britain’s best known authors.

An extraordinary letter damning the ban was signed by Jeffrey Archer, Salman Rushdie, Britain’s poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, Alan Bennett, Julian Barnes, Ian McEwan, David Hare, Irvine Welsh, Joanne Harris, Sarah Waters, Ian Rankin, Nick Hornby and Deborah Moggach.

Now the prisons boss Nick Hardwick has added his voice to the campaign.

'The problem in this case is trying to micromanage this, with the centre describing very detailed lists of what prisoners can and can't have,' he told the Independent.

'I think that's a mistake.

'I think that once the policy intention is clear, how that's implemented should be left much more to the discretion and the common sense of governors, so that they can reflect the needs of their particular prison population'.

Critics: Ian Rankin, left, and Mary Beard, right, are two big names who have come out against the new prison scheme

Backing: Other signatories include Salman Rushdie (left) and Britain's poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy (right)

The
 scheme has caused uproar among writers and civil liberties groups - one
 of which likened it to measures seen at the Guantanamo Bay detention 
camp. They argue there should be no restrictions on access to books in 
prisons, supposed to be places of rehabilitation and education.

The new regime prevents prisoners 
being sent parcels, previously allowed at the discretion of jail 
governors, except in exceptional circumstances such as for provision of 
medical supplies.

Reform campaigners say that as well as books, other 
items, such as underwear and stationery, are being restricted. Inmates 
have to buy items from prison shops instead.

Attack: Civil liberties groups say that the Ministry of Justice is trying to impose a policy used at Guantanamo Bay, but the Government says it will stop the flow of drugs

The
 Justice Secretary has insisted that parcels being sent into 
prisons had been a vehicle for ‘contraband’ and there were not enough 
staff to check them all properly.

He insisted prisoners could access 
books from jail libraries and could purchase more using money earned by 
working inside.

‘Parcels
 are an obvious conduit for getting drugs into prisons. If we allowed 
all prisoners to have access to parcels from home, it would be an 
impossible volume of post to go through systematically,’ Mr Grayling 
said.

‘What we have done is set out rules 
that say when people can have parcels from home. The idea that we are 
banning access to books for prisoners is frankly ridiculous'.
