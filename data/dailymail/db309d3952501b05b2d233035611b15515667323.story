'I'm being victimised': Bob Crow says he is under no moral obligation to move out of his council house

Union firebrand Bob Crow has said he has ‘no moral duty’ to move out of his council house – despite earning £145,000 in salary and expenses.

The general secretary of the rail union RMT still lives with his family in taxpayer-subsidised social housing even though millions of much more needy people are stuck on  waiting lists.

Challenged in a radio interview about his failure to buy his own home, he claimed he was being ‘victimised’ and denied there was any ethical obligation for him to do so.

‘I have no moral duty at all,’ he said. ‘I was born in a council house, as far as I’m concerned I will die in one.’

Mr Crow, 52, spoke on the day that he revealed his union could strike for a whole working week in response to plans by Transport for London to close ticket offices across the Tube network, with the loss of 750 jobs.

He appeared on London’s LBC radio sporting a tan just after returning from holiday.

Presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer challenged the union boss about why he was still living in a housing association home in North London, when he was on such a high wage.

She suggested that if he moved out, the home could be used for a family on a waiting list for social housing who might currently be living in overcrowded accommodation. Mr Crow said that if he did move out into a private home, it would be unfair on his family.

‘Yes I could buy my own place but why don’t you ask the rest of my family who live at home with me whether they should have to move as well?’ he said.

‘Why is it just down to me to buy a house? Why should my family who have lived there for 30 years, with all the friends they’ve got, have to move because of the job I’ve got?’ The RMT leader suggested that if he did move he would be seen as having deserted his working class roots.

‘If I moved out of my house tomorrow the first thing you’d say is Comrade Crow leaves his roots,’ he said.

Staying put: Mr Crow, who earns £145,000, said 'I was born in a council house so I will die in one'

‘It’s an absolute nonsense. I’m the only one down my road who pays their rent and I’m being victimised.’

He said it did not say anywhere in the rules that ‘someone who pays their rent every week, doesn’t claim social security’ should have to give up their council home. Mr Crow said the reason behind the shortage of social housing was not because of people like him, but because of Margaret Thatcher’s policy of right to buy, which allowed council housing tenants to buy their own homes.

But a ban on councils building their own homes meant that these were never replenished – causing a shortage.

He also denied he was the recipient of ‘subsidised rent’, even though his rent will be much less than the market rents for similar properties in his area.
