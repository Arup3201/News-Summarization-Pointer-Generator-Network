A San Francisco parks worker who allegedly ran over and killed a mother who was sunbathing with her baby, will be charged with manslaughter.

Thomas Burnoski, 58, is expected to be charged this afternoon in relation to the alleged fatal hit-and-run incident, which took place on Sept 5 in Holly Park, in the city's Bernal Heights neighbourhood.

Victim Christine Svanemyr, 35, suffered lethal injuries to her head and chest; her eight-month-old baby and her dog were unharmed in the incident.

Victim and suspect: Christine 'Christy' Svanemyr has been identified as the woman who was run over and killed at a San Francisco park and Thomas Burnoski (right) is in custody and today expected to be charged

According toÂ NBC Bay Area, Burnoski 
was driving his green Recreation and Park truck on an asphalt path in 
the park but strayed off onto the grass where Svanemyr was lying, his 
attorney said.

Burnoski, who has worked as a part of 
the city's Parks and Recreation department since 2006, was taken into 
custody after police found him and his city-owned maintenance vehicle 
not far from the scene of the accident.

He was placed on administrative leave without pay pending the investigation. His bail has been set at $350,000.

According to the San Francisco 
Chronicle, Burnoski has a clean criminal record aside from a 2012 
citation for talking on a mobile phone while driving.

Ms Svanemyr, a Zen monk known by 
friends and colleagues as 'Chrissy', had spent the past 10 years as an 
enrollment director at San Francisco-based New Ventures West, a school 
that says it specialises in helping people reach their full potential in
life.

Horrible turn: Mrs Svanemyr was sunbathing alongside her 8-month-old daughter and was fatally injured when a car hit her on the grass on Thursday

'Christy was full of brilliance, passion and kindness,' the school said in a statement after her death.

'Her high energy and infectious 
enthusiasm impacted everything and everyone she touched. Those who knew 
her say it was impossible not to be moved by her.'

After being struck, Svanemyr, of Daly City, was taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

Her daughter and dog were returned to the woman's grieving husband, colleagues said.

According to her company profile, Mrs 
Svanemyr graduated magna cum laude from West Virginia University with 
degrees in anthropology, sociology, and ecotourism and recreation 
management.

She was a lifelong dancer who once 
performed at the World Cup in South Korea as part of the professional 
African dance group Azagano.

She was a practitioner of 'Big Mind' meditation, a process that uses western psychological techniques and Buddhist teachings.

She said her greatest joy and teacher is her daughter.

The profile said she understands 'it's
no longer a good idea to "save all sentient beings" but her 
responsibility to try to do as much as possible to make this world a 
kinder, gentler place for our sons and daughters to be in.'

Parks department General Manager Phil 
Ginsburg said employees were devastated, and the agency is fully 
cooperating with the ongoing investigation.

County Supervisor David Campos, whose 
district includes Holly Park, said the Board of Supervisors would look 
at the rules governing park vehicles. He told KTVU-TV that he had 
expressed concern to Ginsburg about the incident.

Her husband, Vegar Svanemyr, is the school's communications director. The couple previously lived in Salt Lake City.
