A leading civil servant who was sacked after she claimed hundreds of pounds on expenses to pay for a meditation course is suing the Government for £1m.

Dr Angelika Hibbett said she endured 'workplace stress and bullying' from bosses while working at the Home Office in London after she suffered from mental health problems.

She was fired for gross misconduct after it emerged she had put in a claim for £390 to pay for a 'relaxation and meditation' training course to combat her depression.

The Government has refuted the allegations and claims that Dr Hibbett who earned a salary of £63,000 was 'defensive and refused to accept criticism.'

After joining the home office in 2007 Dr Hibbett worked as a programme director in the crime and policing group’s research and analysis unit.

The statement she gave to the tribunal said she was 'diagnosed with work stress-related (reactive) anxiety and depression'.

She said she decided to take the relaxation and mediation therapy course when her doctor told her she would require medication for a 'long time'.

The 56 year old says the £390 expenses claim she put in for the course, was approved by automatic government software, according to The Evening Standard.

However, she repaid the sum when bosses threatened to bring gross misconduct charges against her, the tribunal was told.

Dr Hibbett, says her health suffered as a result and she was forced to endure more stress and bullying in the workplace.

As a result, she claims, she was sacked in 2010 despite being off sick for more than four months.

The crime and policing group’s director of finance and performance, Stephen Webb, told the tribunal that the expenses claim amounted to 'insubordination' and it was his job to 'guard public money'.

He said his department had 'bent over backwards to accommodate Angelika'.

The tribunal is due to finish today.
