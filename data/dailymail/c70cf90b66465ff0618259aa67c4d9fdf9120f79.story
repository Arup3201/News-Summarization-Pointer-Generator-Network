A couple who weighed a combined 32st were shamed into slimming by their own family - during Christmas dinner.

Margaret Gibson, 37, and her husband, James, 41, from Biddulph, Staffs, started piling on the pounds after the birth of their two children just over a decade ago.

But after taunts during the festive feast - and a warning from James's doctor that he couldn't undergo a procedure because he would 'die on the operating table' - the pair took action and have lost more than 7st between them.

Wake up call: James, 41, and Margaret Gibson, 37, have shed a combined 7st in the last 11 months

By last Christmas Margaret tipped the scales at 12st 5lb and James weighed an unhealthy 20st.

But the mother-of-two received a stark wake-up call when her father made a hurtful comment about her size.

Margaret, a law firm secretary, said: 'I can't remember exactly what my father said but he made some sort of flippant comment to me about our appetite and I was really embarrassed.

'It was literally while we were having Christmas dinner and I wasn't very impressed at all, but that's when I decided it was time to start losing weight.'

Since joining Weight Watchers in January, Margaret lost 2st 5lb to reach a healthier 10st and husband James shed 4st.

Margaret, has dropped from a hefty size 18 to a size 12, and James's waist measurement has shrunk from 44in to 34in.

'It was literally while we were having Christmas dinner and I wasn't very impressed at all, but that's when I decided it was time to start losing weight.'

The pair piled on the pounds after buying a house, having children and enjoying a 'blow out' for a while

'We have just changed our style of cooking. Instead of buying a jar of sauce, we make our own with the Weight Watchers recipes. We make sure to eat as a family.

'I feel much better than before. I have more energy. Our weight loss has helped the kids as well. 

'Being heavier did not stop us doing things before, but we are more active now.'

Self-employed hairdresser James added: 'I went to the doctor about a varicose veins operation and the consultant said 'If I operate on you, you will die on my table'.

'It was a kick up the backside. And then Margaret had the comments about her weight over dinner last year, so we decided to do something about it.

'Weight Watchers is easy to follow. We tried other diets before, but this is the one we have done well with.

'We used to eat fairly healthily, but on a weekend, we would go to McDonald's with the children and we would go to the local chip shop one night a week.

'Now, we eat less takeaway and try to make things from scratch. Our children have benefited from the meals as well. 

'We go to meetings together to support each other, if one has a bad week, the other is there.

'We are finally getting back to the size we were when we got married. 

'You do not realise, you don't see the weight creeping on to you.

'People ask where the "big, fat hairdresser" has gone and I am like "I am still here".'

Margaret ensures the family eats together and she has swapped out store bought food for homemade dishes

The Gibsons followed the ProPoints system, which allots food a value depending on the amount of protein, carbohydrate and fat it contains.

Just weeks away from December 25, the family is looking forward to enjoying slimline seasonal festivities.

Margaret said: 'We can enjoy our Christmas dinner this year without having to feel too guilty.'
