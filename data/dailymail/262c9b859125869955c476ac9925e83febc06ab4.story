EU inspectors have found indications of tobacco smuggling from Gibraltar into Spain after the Spanish government claimed if all of the cigarettes imported to the enclave were legal every citizen would be smoking nine packs a day. 

The EU's Fraud Office - OLAF - has now written to the Spanish and British governments urging judicial investigations, according to reports in the Spanish press today.

The letters state: 'There are reasons to believe that the crimes of tobacco smuggling and the laundering of capital affecting the financial interests, or of another nature, of the European Union have been committed in Gibraltar,' said the reports.

The letters were sent to the Spanish Treasury and to the United Kingdom's permanent representative at the EU to be 'transmitted to the Gibraltar authorities', at the end of last month,the reports state.

The OLAF conclusions followed public visits by inspectors from the European Commission to Gibraltar and the town of La Linea on the Spanish side of the frontier in September 2013, July this year, and an unreported visit in March this year.

The inspections came following complaints by the British and Gibraltarian governments about Spanish customs and police checks on the border frequently causing delays lasting hours.

Spain repeatedly countered that the checks were necessary because of massive cigarette smuggling across the frontier from the Rock and the use of Gibraltar's banking system to evade Spanish taxes and launder EU money.

The European Commission's recognition of illegal activities on the frontier was a 'triumph for the Spanish government' reported El Pais, the country's most read daily newspaper.

Gibraltar, with a population of less than 30,000, imported 117 million packets of cigarettes in 2013, reported El Pais. 

The newspaper quoted a Spanish government official as saying: 'Every Gibraltarian, including unweaned babies, would each have to smoke nine packets a day.'

Cigarettes in Gibraltar cost almost half what they do in Spain.

The State Prosecutors office at the National Criminal Court in Madrid has said that it was opening an investigation into cigarette smuggling and money laundering in Gibraltar following the OLAF report, a copy of which reached the court at the beginning of this month.

The court had jurisdiction because they were crimes committed by Spanish subjects abroad, an official told the national newsagency EFE. 

A recent law banned the court from handling cases outside Spain unless Spaniards were involved either as suspects or victims.

A dramatic increase in tobacco smuggling from the Rock into Spain over the past four years indicated that organised crime was involved, said the official.

Figures supplied by the Spanish Foreign Ministry claimed that the number of packets of cigarettes seized on the frontier rose from 636,499 in 2012 to 971,463 last year. And in the first two months of this year 137,815 were seized.
