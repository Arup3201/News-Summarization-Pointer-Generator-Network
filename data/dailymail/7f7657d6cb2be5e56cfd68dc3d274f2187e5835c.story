A brutal rapist who terrorised elderly women in a suburb for more than a decade was told today he will live out his days behind bars.

Michael Roberts, 45, has become the first man to get a 'life means life' sentence for rape after raping three victims - one aged 83 - and viciously attacking a fourth in Bermondsey, south London.

Known as the Bermondsey Beast, he evaded justice for 15 years but was captured after a cold case review by Scotland Yard using advances in DNA.

Jailed: Michael Roberts, 45, joins a small group of 'life means life' prisoners after raping three victims - one aged 83 - and viciously attacking a fourth in Bermondsey, south London

Following a trial at Southwark Crown Court, the 45-year-old, of no fixed address, was given four life sentences by Judge Stephen Robbins.

Judge Robbins said: 'I do sentence you to imprisonment for the rest of your natural life ... your utter depravity knows no bounds, these are very grave offences.'

After the sentence was read out Roberts 
said: ‘I will only say this my lord, I am absolutely not guilty and I 
will...’ before he was dragged from the dock by prison guards.

Roberts subjected his terrified victims to horrific ordeals
during a series of violent burglaries in south London in the late 
1980s.

At the time, the crimes sparked nationwide outrage and mass media coverage but Roberts eluded capture.

He has also been nicknamed ‘The Praying Rapist’ after crossing himself 
and uttering the words from the Roman Catholic prayer for the dead 
during one attack.

Roberts was caught because he had given a DNA sample after attacking an elderly man in his own home.

DNA matches from the scene threw up a partial match to his DNA in 2005 and it was realised he fitted a description of his now dead victims.

In addition his 
methods of attack matched that of some of his other many crimes which did not involve violence. 

Roberts struck for the first time on 
Boxing Day 1988, breaking into the home of a 57-year-old woman in Lant Street, Southwark - 800 yards from his then home in Gaywood
Street.

The woman was a virgin who had mobility problems.

He beat her up and raped her before escaping with £75 and six packets of cigarettes.

On September 11 1989, Roberts attacked a 77-year-old who lived in the same building in Lant Street.

The pensioner was also a virgin and had difficulty getting around.

Roberts raped her and stole £5 and lose change before he left the flat.

On October 7 1989, Roberts, entered 
the home of a 66-year-old woman in Rotherhithe and 
raped her, before stealing two purses containing £30 in cash and a bank 
card.

Between February 28 and 2 March 1990,
he burgled the home of an 83-year-old woman in Keetons Estate, Rotherhithe, beating her up severely and stealing her 
pension book and bank card as well as a handbag.

The addresses of the third and fourth victims were within 300 yards of his address at the time in St James’ Road.

Jurors unanimously convicted Roberts of three rapes and the brutal beating of a fourth victim following a short trial last month.

Although he was only tried for four 
attacks, he has been blamed for other similar crimes 
during the same period, including the rape and murder of 68-year-old 
Irene Grainey.

The grandmother was sexually attacked and stabbed to death with a kitchen knife on May 31, 1990.

Her body lay undiscovered for six weeks at her council maisonette in Rotherhithe, May 31, 1990.

After the jury delivered its verdicts the court heard Roberts had been 
linked to two other violent attacks on victims aged 68 and 78 in 1989.

But the murder of Mrs Grainey remained unsolved.

Judge Stephen Robbins, likening the case to the case of ‘Night Stalker’ Delroy Grant and said: ‘Your depravity knows no bounds.

‘These are very grave offences. The victims of your offences were all elderly. You broke into their houses and in the middle of the night.

‘You then proceeded to submit them to humiliating and degrading sexual 
attacks and, unlike Delroy Grant, your offences are aggravated and 
marked by terrible violence.

‘I’m quite satisfied that you are a danger to society therefore I do 
sentence you to imprisonment for the rest if your natural life.’

Roberts appeared 
in the dock wearing light beige trousers and a black shirt.

He evaded capture hiding a distinctive scar on his forehead from his victims by wearing his hair in a floppy fringe and warning the victims not to look at his face.

But other features gave him away, including his back, which one of the women accurately said was covered in brown marks and moles, and his clothing, including a dirty green tracksuit.

His fourth victim was so badly beaten that she remembered nothing about her attacker.

Roberts confessed that assault to his girlfriend at the time after hearing it reported on the radio, the jury heard.

Material recovered from the attacker’s semen and saliva from cigarettes he smoked only provided ‘partial’ matches to Roberts’ profile, with a one in 79,000 chance that it did not come from him in one sample down to as much as a one in 16 chance in another.

But prosecutor Allison Hunter said all the evidence taken together, with partial matches found at three different scenes, alongside the visual identifications, the confession to his girlfriend and other circumstantial evidence, the jury could be sure he was the attacker.

Judge Stephen Robbins likened the case to the 'Night Stalker' Delroy Grant, pictured, who attacked pensioners over 17 years

Roberts lived within a few hundred yards of all four victims, and staked out their homes prior to the attacks.

He chose elderly woman living alone in ground floor flats, and attacked them in their homes late at night before making off with small amounts of cash and jewellery.

His victims described how he smelled strongly of alcohol, and told one of them he had been at the pub before the attack.

The jury heard evidence from the two women Roberts lived with during the period of the attacks - Julie Warner and Leanne Ward.

He had been violent to both women and Miss Ward described in a statement how he was a petty criminal who would often return home late at night with handbags he had stolen.

She told the court he used to scan newspapers for coverage of his exploits, believing at the time that he was referring to lesser crimes.

Miss Ward also said she remembered he owned a pale green tracksuit similar to that described by one of the victims.

Miss Warner said that after hearing about the fourth attack on the radio, the savage beating of an 83-year-old woman, he told her: ‘I did that, but I didn’t rape her.’

Although he did not give evidence during the trial, Roberts’ barrister Ali Bajwa, QC, told the jury in his closing speech that the Crown had not produced enough evidence to prove he had committed the offences.

Roberts, formerly of St James’ Road, Rotherhithe, was convicted of three counts of rape, four counts of burglary, two counts of indecent assault, two counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, and one count of buggery.

Speaking outside court, a son of one 
of his victims said: 'Today’s sentence for the families is absolutely 
brilliant. He deserves everything he got.' 

Detective Inspector Nathan Eason, one
of the investigating officers on the case, said: 'Michael Roberts is a 
sexual predator who preyed on vulnerable women in the late 80s and early
90s. 

'Unfortunately none of his victims 
lived to see him being brought to justice today but the family members 
of the victims have expressed deep satisfaction with handed down today. '
