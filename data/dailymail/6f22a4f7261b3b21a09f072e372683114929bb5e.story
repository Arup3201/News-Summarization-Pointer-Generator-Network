David Blunkett, the former Home Secretary, said Miliband needed to highlight to voters that he was heading up a team

David Blunkett suggested last night that Labour should underplay the fact that Ed Miliband is their leader during the election.

As doubts grow over Mr Miliband’s stewardship of the party, the former Home Secretary said he needed to highlight to voters that he was heading up a team – and not to concentrate campaigning on him alone.

‘The offer is a Labour government, not a Labour presidency,’ he said.

And he suggested that Mr Miliband was not exciting, saying that former leader John Smith had once told him: ‘If you want excitement, go to the races.’

The suggestion that Labour should campaign for victory without drawing attention to their leader will not be seen as helpful to the beleagured Mr Miliband.

Concern about his performance has dramatically deepened after Ukip finished a close second – just 617 votes from victory – in Thursday’s by-election in the Labour heartland of Heywood and Middleton.

As doubts grow over his leadership, Ed Miliband will address a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party this afternoon.

One MP said: ‘He will face some tough questions. But there is such disillusionment in the party that many people might just not turn up.’

Yesterday Harriet Harman was forced to deny that Mr Miliband will be ditched for a more popular leader before the election.

She said in a TV interview that there would ‘absolutely not’ be a change of leader - and claimed there was no ‘wobble in the ranks’ of the Labour party over his future.

Former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay became the first party figure to openly call for Mr Miliband to go - saying the beleaguered leader was a ‘complete disaster’ and should quit to ‘make way for an election winner’.

Mr MacKinlay was the MP for the seat of Thurrock in Essex - which was a top target for Labour at the next election, but which Ukip are now predicted to win amid deep concerns about immigration.

The senior ex-MP said the party’s performance in the Heywood by-election was not that of a ‘government in waiting’ and described Mr Miliband’s leadership as ‘a complete disaster’.

But Alan Johnson, the charismatic former postman who was home secretary under Gordon Brown, dashed the hopes of Labour MPs who want to see him return as leader by ruling it out.

Mr Johnson said he ‘hated’ being on the front bench in opposition – serving briefly as shadow chancellor - and said he had made it ‘perfectly clear’ to Mr Miliband that ‘I left and I’m not coming back.’

In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Blunkett said he was determined to do no harm to the Labour leadership.

‘I am doing and saying nothing that in any way would damage the chances of electing a Labour government,’ he said.

But, in comments which were seen as admitting there is an Ed problem, he said: ‘There is no point in Ed Miliband being something he is not.

‘I think he needs to build on two strengths: one is the idea of having a conversation with people rather than performing in front of them in a kind of parade; and secondly building a team, as he has been doing, so this is a team approach.

‘Of course, led by him. But actually the offer is a Labour government, not a Labour presidency.’

He added: ‘It is perfectly feasible for someone to have a different style of leadership and be able to deliver.

‘If people want something that is just a performance, then they will be taken in by Nigel Farage. John Smith once said to me, ‘If you want excitement, go to the races.’

Ukip’s best ever result in a Labour-held seat, on the day they won their first MP from the Tories in Clacton, has triggered criticism that Labour has failed to confront voters’ concerns about immigration.

It follows a lacklustre performance by Mr Miliband in the Scottish referendum campaign, which had to be salvaged by Gordon Brown, and a widely panned party conference speech.

Miss Harman yesterday insisted: ‘There is not a wobble in the ranks and nor should there be.

‘I think what is absolutely evident is that the anger and concern there is amongst people when they’re being told that a recovery has arrived and yet they’ re not getting better off and feeling disconnected from politics.

‘That is being picked up on by Ukip.

‘But actually Ukip, although they’re tapping into that sense of despair, they don’t provide the answers.

‘It provides a very big responsibility on us as the Labour party when people see the economy not delivering for them, they’re worried about the health service, it is our responsibility to listen to those concerns and work together to make sure that we get rid of this government and address those concerns.’

Another current MP Graham Stringer said the party could not stand up to the ‘street fighting’ skills of Nigel Farage and should never have come so close to losing a safe seat.

Mr Miliband penned an article for a Sunday newspaper setting out how he would deal with immigration, and saying people’s concerns needed to be addressed.

He reiterated his party’s two policies on the issue– to somehow better control who is coming in and out of Britain’s borders and to enforce the minimum wage so firms cannot undercut British workers by hiring deeper foreign Labour.

Miss Harman said Mr Miliband’s article on immigration yesterday was ‘about a new approach which is saying ‘we do want to talk about immigration, we do have these policies, and that these will actually solve the problems’ not just set out a number like the Tories did’, referring to the target to reduce net migration to tens of thousands which the coalition has failed to meet.

But he faces another potential crisis in the coming months as Tories signalled they are determined to force a Commons vote on the issue of English votes for English laws.

Mr Miliband has so far refused to accept David Cameron’s suggestion for a divide, which would mean Labour’s 41 MPs North of the Border would not be able to vote on English-only issues.

But he faced criticism of this from former Labour home secretary Charles Clarke who said he could no longer avoid the issue, and must come up with proposals ‘very quickly’.

He claimed Mr Miliband’s stance on the issue – promising to hold a constitutional convention in a years’ time was ‘hopeless’ and ‘foolish’ and suggested Labour did not care about England.

Miss Harman denied the Labour party was like a ‘latte-sipping Liberal north London intelligentsia’ as put forward by one unnamed Labour MP.

She told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 (keep) ‘That is not the reality, that is not the Labour party. There are people like myself from professional middle-class backgrounds representing a seat in London. But there are people representing the north east, labour MPs from the north west, west midlands, from Wales and Scotland.

‘Actually, we have people in the Labour party from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds and from different parts of the country. And it’s working together, that broad-based team that listens and understands all parts of the country. That is how we’re going to make the way forward under Ed Miliband’s leadership.’
