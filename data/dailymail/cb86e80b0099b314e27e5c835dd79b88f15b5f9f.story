Town Halls could be legally forced to empty black bins every week, under plans being considered by the Tories.

The move follows revelations that more than five million families have lost weekly bin collections since the Government came to power - despite a pledge to stop the slide to fortnightly pick ups.

Under proposals being considered by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles councils will be required to meet a 'minimum service standard' when it comes to waste collection.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has called weekly bin collections a 'funadamental right' - because it stops rubbish building up like this in Liverpool

Ministers have decided to act after a series of measures designed to stop councils axing weekly collections failed.

Half of councils have switched to fortnightly collections - rejecting a £250million Government bribe introduced in 2012 to encourage them to maintain their weekly service.

And earlier this year Mr Pickles issued a 'bin bible' to try to stop councils from axing weekly rubbish collections.

The Tory Communities Secretary said the guidance - issued to all local authorities - exposed the false claims made by council 'bin barons' to justify scaling back services.

And two years ago, Mr Pickles even claimed that having bins emptied once a week was a ‘fundamental right'.

But cutbacks to the service have accelerated under his watch. At least 60 councils have introduced a fortnightly waste collection since May 2010. By the time of the election next year, 18.5million families will have lost weekly bin rounds.

Mr Pickles has now decided to force councils to change their policy by making it a legal requirement to collect people's black bins every week, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The Local Government Secretary said: 'The UK Government will continue to standing up for hard working people who deserve a decent bin service.

'One option being considered by the Conservatives is the introduction of a minimum service standard, which would reinstate the previous legal requirement for councils to collect rubbish weekly.'

Doretta Cocks, the founder of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collection, said: 'This news is most welcome and our Campaign members will be delighted.

'As councils are now seeking to reduce general refuse collections to once every three or four weeks, legislation is obviously necessary to prevent them from doing so. Weekly collections are essential, especially in summer months.'

But Labour's shadow local government secretary Hilary Benn said: 'Eric Pickles has already announced that he wants to bring back weekly collections and he has totally failed to do so while wasting a quarter of a billion pounds of taxpayers money in the process.

'He should let local councils work out what works best for their residents and stop trying to tell them what to do, especially when it would be more expensive for council tax payers.'

A spokesman for the Local Government Association added: 'Our own polling shows the vast majority - about 80 per cent - of people are happy with the way their bins are collected.

'Satisfaction rates are broadly the same regardless of whether people have weekly or alternate weekly collections.'
