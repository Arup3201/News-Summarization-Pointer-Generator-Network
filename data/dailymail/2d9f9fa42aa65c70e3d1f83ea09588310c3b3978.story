Military chiefs are urgently reviewing the protection offered by the Army’s heavily-armoured Mastiff vehicles after three British soldiers were killed in one by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan.

They are the first troops to have died in one of the 23-ton personnel carriers which have withstood hundreds of attacks since they were brought in specifically to combat the threat from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in 2007.

Six other soldiers were injured by the Taliban bomb which may have contained up to 440lb of high explosives.

The blast does not appear to have penetrated the £1million Mastiff’s armour.

Instead, the casualties were 
apparently caused by the vehicle being blown into the air and the force 
of the impact when it landed and rolled on to its roof.

Yesterday David Cameron confirmed he wanted defence chiefs to look into whether the right equipment was being used.

He said: ‘We have done an enormous 
amount to improve the quality and quantity of protective vehicles that 
our soldiers use out in Afghanistan and, as I understand, it had a 
pretty good record of withstanding blasts from IEDs.

'I’m sure we’ll want
to look at that carefully and put in place everything we can to make 
sure that our brave men and women have the best protective equipment 
they have.

‘The troops have said to me they were 
pretty satisfied with what they had, but we must always look at this.’

The Prime Minister added that the UK had paid a ‘very high price’ for 
the work to stabilise Afghanistan.

General Lord Dannatt, the former head 
of the Army, said: ‘The Taliban have found a way of countering the 
protective qualities of the Mastiff. It would seem that this was an 
extremely large bomb that was so powerful it was able to cause 
fatalities within the vehicle itself.’

He warned that Britain must brace 
itself for more bloody attacks in Afghanistan before 9,000 combat troops
are pulled out by the end of 2014.

Lord Dannatt said the history of any
campaign showed that ‘often those we are fighting increase their 
efforts towards the end to try and play up the fact that they have 
driven us out or to increase their hand in bargaining at the negotiating
table’.

Two of the soldiers who died in the attack on Tuesday were 
Corporal William Savage, 30, and Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, from the 
Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment Of Scotland 
(2 SCOTS).

The third was Private Robert Hetherington, 25, a reservist 
with the 51st Highland, 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment Of Scotland (7 
SCOTS), who was deployed with 2 SCOTS.

Cpl Savage – nicknamed Sav – who 
was born in Irvine, Scotland, was described as a ‘shining example of a 
soldier and a rising star’. His wife Lyndsey, who is expecting their 
first child, said: ‘I am completely devastated but extremely proud of 
Sav. I have lost the love of my life.’

Fusilier Flint, from Blackpool, was 
described as a ‘vastly impressive soldier’. His family said they were 
‘completely devastated’.

Pte Hetherington had represented 
Scotland at lacrosse and was said to have ‘epitomised everything that is
excellent about the reserve forces’.

The men and their six comrades were on
a routine patrol in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province when 
they were attacked. The deaths take the number of British soldiers 
killed in Afghanistan to 444.

The IED, which may have been dug into 
the tarred road surface when it softened during the winter, could have 
been detonated remotely. The Mastiff carries electronic counter-measures
to jam remote-controlled IEDs, and investigators will check for links 
between the massive blast and Iran which is suspected of providing the 
Taliban with bomb training as well as equipment and techniques to avoid 
jamming devices.

Major Chris Hunter, an ex-British Army
bomb disposal operator, said: ‘The Mastiffs are the most 
heavily-armoured vehicles we’ve ever used in a counter-insurgency. But 
any system can be overcome given sufficient time, money and resources.’

Overdue: The MoD's other main armoured vehicle, the Warrior, was heavily criticised by a coroner five years ago for not having enough protection. Improvements were finally made in June 2011

Lieutenant Colonel Lincoln Jopp, a 
former commander of troops in Helmand, said: ‘Whilst you can do 
everything possible to try to mitigate the risks, you can’t eradicate 
them totally and nothing is indestructible.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘If you have an
explosion that’s big enough to lift a vehicle and roll it, you always 
have the possibility that it will lift and soldiers will be killed. You 
can never armour a vehicle enough to withstand every kind of blast.’

The attack came three days after the 
Taliban launched its ‘spring offensive’ against coalition forces. The 
Taliban said they would infiltrate ‘enemy ranks’ to conduct ‘insider 
attacks’ and target military and diplomatic sites with suicide bombers.

A total of 444 British troops have been killed in Afghanistan since Western forces invaded the country in 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks.

In addition, more than 2,000 American troops and over 600 soldiers from other countries in the Nato coalition have died as a result of fighting with the Taliban.

The latest deaths bring the total of British casualties in 2013 so far to six, all in the dangerous Helmand Province which is often considered a Taliban stronghold.

Blown up: The deaths of (top row left to right) Sergeant Nigel Coupe, Corporal Jake Hartley, Private Anthony Frampton and (bottom row left to right) Private Christopher Kershaw, Private Daniel Wade and Private Daniel Wilford in March last year was the biggest-ever single loss at the hands of insurgents

Sapper Richard Walker was killed in January in a 'blue on green' attack from a rogue member of the Afghan National Army.

Kingsman David Shaw died weeks later when his checkpoint came under fire from insurgents - he was airlifted back to the UK for hospital treatment, but did not survive.

In March, L/Cpl Jamie Webb, 24, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, died after an attack by Taliban militants in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand.

Last year, six British servicemen were killed when a roadside bomb struck their armoured vehicle.

The attack was the worst single loss of life for UK troops in Afghanistan since a Nimrod crash killed 14 in 2006.

The deaths of Cpl Jake Hartley, 20, Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, and Sgt Nigel Coupe, 33, was the biggest-ever loss at the hands of insurgents.

While many parts of the country remain unsafe, the rate of British casualties has been slowing as Western troops have gradually pulled out of their operations in Afghanistan.

All combat forces are due to leave by the end of next year, when security will be handed over to the Afghan army and police.
