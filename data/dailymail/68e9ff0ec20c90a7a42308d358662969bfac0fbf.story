A man who became obsessed with 1960s fantasy sitcom I Dream Of Jeannie when he was just four years old has finally met the show's star, 46 years later.

Greg Cochrane, 50, from Sarasota, Florida, is such a fan of the show, he has several mannequins dressed as Jeannie, played by Barbara Eden, and takes them around with him.

Now, ,decades after he first watched Ms Eden on the small screen of his childhood home, Mr Cochrane has flown to Kansas City to meet his idol.

And of course, he took his favourite mannequin with him.

Greg Cochrane took his plastic replica Jeannie to meet the show's star, Barbara Eden, and even bought it its own plane seat

In a trip filmed by TLC for their show My Crazy Obsession, Mr Cochrane packed up his life-size mannequin of Jeannie and headed off to Missouri.

The footage shows him sitting next to his doll on the plane - he bought it a seat to avoid it being checked in like luggage, and then taking it to the theatre where Ms Eden was starring in a play.

The actress invited Mr Cochrane, who spent $1,000 on the trip, up on to stage and he told her breathlessly: 'I've waited 46 years to meet you.'

Ms Eden was so overcome with the excitement of it she tripped over, but after picking herself up she said: 'Well, I'm so happy that you did.'

Mr Cochrane, who has long collected classic Hollywood memorabilia, said: 'I've just met Barbara in person - it is no longer a fantasy for me.

'It'll always be a part of my memory.' 

Mr Cochrane began watching the cult 1960s show when he was just four - now 50, he has finally met the show's star

As Mr Cochrane was introduced to Barbara Eden, he whispered: 'I've waited 46 years to meet you'

Greg Cochrane was happy to buy his Jeannie replica her own plane seat to avoid having the doll thrown in the hold

In the show which was broadcast last night, Mr Cochrane added: 'After all these years of collecting, it's finally paid off.'

Mr Cochrane has collected all kinds of Hollywood memorabilia since he was a child, but Ms Eden's iconic character, and the show she starred in, held a special significance for him,and he admits having watched it over and over again.

He has several life-size Jeannie mannequins, as well as board games, videos, dolls and one of the original genie bottles used in the show.

In the original TV show, Barbara Eden wore exactly the same revealing costume as that worn by Mr Cochrane's doll

Barbara Eden, who is now 78, seemed delighted to meet her most ardent fan, and quickly regained composure after tripping over

I Dream Of Jeannie, created by legendary writer Sidney Sheldon, starred Larry Hagman along with Ms Eden and began a five-season run in September 1965.

Ms Eden starred as a 2,000-year-old genie who eventually falls in love with her master, Major Nelson, played by Mr Hagman.

In most of the shows, the Jeannie character wore a revealing costume but was forbidden from showing her navel.  Censors agreed that it was OK that she - an unmarried woman - lived in the same house as another man because she slept in her bottle.

Mr Cochrane has an all-encompassing selection of memorabilia related to the 1960s show, including a board game, above
