Northern Ireland forward Kyle Lafferty felt his team sent out a massive statement with a stunning win over Group F favourites Greece in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Athens.

Lafferty sealed the points six minutes into the second half finishing off a superb counter-attack after Jamie Ward had given Michael O'Neill's side a ninth-minute lead. 

The Norwich striker led the cheers in the dressing room after the emphatic result saw the visitors make it three wins from three - their best ever start to a qualifying campaign.

'I'm lost for words,' Lafferty told Sky Sports 2. 'That was great. The lads worked hard all week. We got a great result against the Faroe Islands (2-0 win on Saturday). Coming here, we knew it would be a tough game, but we have a great spirit in our team.

'We believe in ourselves. Michael's put that belief in the team. Every single player believes we can qualify for the Euros. We sent out a massive statement tonight.'

On his fine personal form which has seen him pick up man of the match in each of their qualifiers, Lafferty added: 'To score three goals in three qualifying games, I'm delighted.

'But it's not all about myself - it's about the team. We got the three points we came here for and we're sitting top of the league on nine points.' 

O'Neill admits his history-making side are well ahead of schedule on the road to Euro 2016 in France after they added Claudio Ranieri's Greece to a list of victims that already included Hungary and the Faroe Islands.

O'Neill is keen to play the pragmatist, insisting third place and a play-off remains his primary objective, but he also had a feeling that a big result was in the offing in Athens.

Lafferty is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring - he praised the side's belief and unity after the match 

'We wouldn't have expected to win our first three games but I had a good feeling about this one,' he said.

'I said to the players if we had six points after four games we'd probably be relatively pleased, now it's nine from three.

'I thought we were magnificent. The players are delighted too, but I don't think they're surprised.

'They believed they could come here and get something from the game.

'The players have performed so well that there was confidence in them and we got a performance of real discipline and excellent quality when we had the opportunity to break and counter attack.'

Lafferty, 27, struggled for form and fitness last campaign under O'Neill, but the manager now believes the powerful forward has matured into a force to be reckoned with on the world stage.

'Kyle has all the attributes to play right at the top level of the game - pace, technique, power, size. What he has done in the last three games is bring it all together,' said O'Neill. 

'International football suits him, particularly away from home when there is space.

'When he plays like that, he is as good as any centre forward that you'd wish to have.

'What we've seen in the last three games with his focus is a top class international striker developing. Long may it continue.'
