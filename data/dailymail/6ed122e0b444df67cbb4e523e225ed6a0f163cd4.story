A new photograph has emerged of the lucky flying fox pups that were rescued after an extreme heatwave killed thousands of their mothers.

The seven baby bats, which were bundled up in colourful blankets and pictured lying in a row, are among over 400 of the young flying mammals that were saved in northern New South Wales over the weekend.

In stark contrast to the adorable picture, are the photographs of up to five thousand adult bats that died before falling out of their trees in the small town of Casino when temperatures soared to 44 degrees on Saturday.

Over 400 young flying foxes, aged between one-day-old to four-weeks-old, were saved after they were found clinging to their dead mums

Up to five thousand bats died in the small town of Casino, when the temperature soared to 44 degrees over the weekend 

'The flying foxes were dead and dying in the trees and they were just falling like rain from the trees all around us,' Renata Phelps, the critical incident coordinator for wildlife rescue organisation WIRES, told the ABC.

'All those females that fell had little babies tucked under their wings.

'Corpses all over the ground with dead babies crying on their mum's bodies.'

The orphaned bat pups, which are aged between only one-day-old and four-weeks-old, are in the process of being transported to carers across New South Wales and even some areas of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.

'The feeding of these pups is around the clock, making up bottles, feeding, washing up bottles and teats,' a spokesperson for the organisation said.

Local photographer, Dee Hartin, captured photographs of the tragic scenes in Casino, where thousands of bat carcases littered the streets.

A spokesperson for Wires explained that 'the extreme heat, low humidity and lack of shade' too early in the season, led the flying foxes to die in droves.

By 1pm on Saturday, the first flying foxes began falling to the ground after dying in their trees.

'The feeding of these pups is around the clock, making up bottles, feeding, washing up bottles and teats,' a WIRES spokesperson said

The Rural Fire service was called in to spray trees with water in an effort to provide humidity relief to the surviving bats 

'The task is ongoing; carers are working round the clock and emotions are tested as carers do what they can to ensure each and every little flying fox is taken care of whilst dealing with the sight of thousands of adults and juveniles dead and dying,' a WIRES spokesperson said.

Meanwhile the Rural Fire service was also called in to spray trees with water in an effort to provide humidity relief to the rest of the bat colony.

Although temperatures have since cooled in the small town, WIRES has expressed fear that the overly warm weather expected for the coming weekend could lead to more deaths.

While most of the carcases have now been cleared, the local council has issued a health warning for those that remain by an inaccessible riverbank

The streets of Casino, in northern New South Wales, are still being cleared of the carcasses after temperatures soared to 44 degrees on Saturday 

While most of the carcases have now been cleared, the local council has issued a health warning.

'Some areas along the riverbank are inaccessible and the stench from the rotting carcasses will be quite unbearable for some time yet,' John Walker, the general manager of Richmond Valley Council, said.

'People should avoid the area and not try to help living bats themselves as they could bite and scratch and some carry the lyssavirus.'

'Young children could be attracted to the bats on the ground but there could be serious health risks if they pick them up,' Mr Walker said.
