More than half of Real Madrid's supporters would be happy for the club to accept a bid in excess of €150million (£118m) for Gareth Bale, a survey on AS.com has revealed.

Reports on Tuesday suggested that Manchester United are lining up a world-record £120million bid for the former Tottenham winger, and in a survey of over 30,000 readers, 53.75 per cent admitted they would be happy to let him go.

Bale has already won four trophies in his time at the Spanish club - the Champions League, Spanish Cup, Euro Super Cup and, this week, the Club World Cup - but his days at the Bernabeu could be numbered.

Louis van Gaal refused to comment on the reports at his press conference on Tuesday, suggesting that the matter is something he will discuss with the Manchester United hierarchy and not the press. 

'I cannot discuss that with you,' Van Gaal said. 'I discuss that with my CEO and not with anyone of the media.'

Despite the poll, Bale is well-loved among the Madrid support, having scored 33 goals in his first 66 appearances for the club. In that time, he has provided 24 assists too.
