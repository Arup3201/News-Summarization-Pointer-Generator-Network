The fate of the United Kingdom was being 'closely' followed by the Queen last night, as she is poised to lead an attempt to heal the wounds of Scotland’s rancorous independence battle. 

Palace officials said the monarch was being kept abreast of the latest news from counting centres across Scotland as votes against independence mounted. 

And senior advisers were due to meet from 1am to plan the official response to the break-up of the Union or the need to heal the bitter divisions of the campaign.

With all 32 local authorities declared, it was revealed this morning Scotland voted against independence with a majority of 55 per cent.

The Queen had been due to host her annual Ghillies Ball last night for workers on her Balmoral estate.

But it was delayed by a day to allow her staff to cast their vote and give the Queen the opportunity to be updated on the results as they came in.

Palace aides said the Queen was following the result 'closely' and 'being kept abreast of matters by officials in Edinburgh and London', Sky News reported.

It is understood that staff were to hold a meeting overnight to plan the Queen's official response, when the result became clear. 

The referendum followed a two-year campaign that has riven a nation and stirred resentment in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Prime Minister David Cameron was also 'following events closely' and made a statement on Friday morning 

Sources said the Queen was also considering delivering a message to the country over the coming days in an attempt to encourage unity

From remote Scottish islands to the tough city estates of Glasgow, people were divided over a vote being watched intently across the world.

Yesterday, church leaders urged both unionist and separatist campaigners to come together to build harmony in the wake of the vote, which has divided friends and family. 

Sources said the Queen was also considering delivering a message to the country over the coming days in an attempt to encourage unity.

Though Buckingham Palace stressed her political neutrality, she intervened in the closing days to urge Scots to ‘think carefully’ about their votes in what was widely interpreted as a counsel of caution.

David Cameron is also expected to make a televised address from Downing Street today. 

The Prime Minister made a series of visits to Scotland during the campaign to deliver increasingly desperate appeals for the Scots to stay in the Union.

Downing Street sources said Mr Cameron was 'following events closely'. 

The Queen's deep interest in last night's events follows her dramatic intervention in the campaign on Sunday when she urged caution over the referendum.

Her Majesty told a member of the public that voters should 'think very carefully about the future' as she emerged from the morning service at the church she attends near Balmoral.

It came after Prince Harry also revealed that he expected Scotland would remain in the United Kingdom next year.

The Queen's comment was widely viewed as urging voters to take caution before backing independence, which would chime with comments made four decades ago that she wanted to rule as the Queen of every country in the UK.

Unusually, reporters were allowed to listen in to the Queen talking to wellwishers outside the church.

In 1977 when there were calls for a devolved parliament in Scotland, the Queen used a speech to issue a blunt warning against breaking up the Union.

She said: 'I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and of Northern Ireland. 

'Perhaps this Jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of the United Kingdom.' 

But Buckingham Palace last week issued a stern warning that the 'Monarch is above politics' and stressing that 'those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case'.
