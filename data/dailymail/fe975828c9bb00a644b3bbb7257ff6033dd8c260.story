A Royal Protection officer has been arrested after bullets were found hidden in personal police lockers in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

The 9mm ammunition was found in a dedicated 'police station' within the palace grounds and is believed to be from the Metropolitan Police's own supplies.

The officer was arrested at his home on suspicion of misconduct in public office and unlawful possession of ammunition.

He is in custody at a London police station and will be suspended from duty, the force said.

The officer 'normally works in a protection role' but was not assigned to guard any individual member of the Royal family, police said. He has not been charged with an offence.

He was arrested after an investigation by the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards which began a few weeks ago.

The probe was triggered by other Royal Protection officers, who found ammunition in their personal lockers and belongings before raising the alarm with their bosses.

Investigators are believed to be considering whether the officer could have deliberately placed the bullets in a bid to ‘discredit’ colleagues in the tight-knit unit.

The palace 'police station' in which the bullets were found is just inside an entrance known as Electricians Gate, on the south side of the Royal residence. 

Guarded: The Palace has round-the-clock protection from specially-trained elite officers from the Met Police

The lodge houses a parade room, lockers and armoury for the squad of officers charged with protecting the Queen, her family and guests.

A Met Police spokesman said: 'Investigators have been searching the officer's home address and the police building where the ammunition was found.

'Established security procedures are unaffected by the investigation, which does not affect the daily work of the officers providing personal protection to the Royal Family.

'These units include some of the most highly trained and professional officers in the Met. They recognise the great responsibility their roles carry, and the privilege that goes with these positions.

'The Royal Household is aware of the on-going investigation and has been briefed on today's development. The IPCC have been informed.' 

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'It is a matter for the Metropolitan Police. We would never comment on security issues.' 

Scotland Yard refused to reveal their suspect's age or the area in which he lives for 'operational reasons', despite these two details almost always being available after any arrest.

Any misuse of bullets would be an extremely serious breach of police protocol and a potential criminal offence.

It is a further embarrassment for the prestigious command at a time when security is already under review at high-profile buildings in the wake of the Ottawa shooting. 

Last week the Met announced it was shaking up the structure of its protection wing after a litany of scandals including Plebgate. 

Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said restructures had revealed 'a few pockets of poor behaviour which would not be tolerated'.

He added: 'Nothing below the highest standards of personal behaviour is acceptable.' 

Senior commanders want to break up this unhealthy working culture and cut the jaw-dropping cost to taxpayers of protection operations, which include Royals, senior politicians and visiting dignitaries. 

A Buckingham Palace sergeant remains suspended from duty over separate claims earlier this year that he took knives, umbrellas and other items surrendered by public visitors and sold them on eBay. 

Officers from the elite unit have been tested by several breaches at Buckingham Palace, which was completed in 1850 and has 24-hour protection.

In 2004 a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner dressed as Batman broke through heavy security to climb onto a balcony an unfurl a banner.

And in 1982 the Queen infamously spent ten minutes talking to a man who had scaled a drainpipe to climb into the monarch's private apartments.

Known as SO14, the Royal Protection unit is one of the most elite in the force. Officers are picked from the Met's most experienced staff and receive specialist training.

The eye-watering cost of protecting the royals is famously kept secret by authorities on security grounds, but has been estimated at around £100million by previous investigations.

Several members of the Royal family as well as their homes and palaces have 24-hour protection, including some who have not been subject to any particular terror threats. 

One member of the SO14 squad, Jim Beaton, famously took three bullets for Princess Anne during a kidnapping attempt as she returned to Buckingham Palace in her limousine in March 1974.

The altercation, which remains the closest anyone has ever come to kidnapping a member of the Royal family, took place outside the palace on the Mall.
