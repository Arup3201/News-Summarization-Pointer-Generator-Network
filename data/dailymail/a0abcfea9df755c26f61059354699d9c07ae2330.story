Tottenham will launch a bid for Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez in the coming weeks.

Although the England forward is recovering from surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, the White Hart Lane club are convinced he will be back in action before the end of the year.

Southampton have already fielded bids of £25million from Manchester United for Luke Shaw and £20m from Liverpool for Adam Lallana and are now braced for Tottenham's opening gambit for Rodriguez.

Earning his Spurs? Jay Rodriguez is a summer target for Tottenham

In good form: Rodriguez scored 17 goals for Southampton before his season was cut short by injury 

The 24-year-old was in excellent form for Southampton prior to his injury scoring 17 goals and was pushing for inclusion in Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad.

Tottenham, who could yet appoint Southampton coach Mauricio Pochettino as their new manager, want more homegrown players to blend with the large influx of foreign players they invested heavily in last summer.

Some of those will go, with Romanian centre-back Vlad Chiriches, Erik Lamela, Etienne Capoue, Roberto Soldado and the more established Jan Vertonghen all attracting interest - predominantly from Italian clubs.

Rodriguez can play from the left of the attack or behind a main striker and his pace and intelligence gave Southampton a cutting edge that had hem pushing for European contention at one stage of the season.

They face a difficult summer and will be fighting off more bids with Calum Chambers, Morgan Schneiderlin, Victor Wanyama and Dejan Lovren all subject to interest from Premier League rivals.

Reunited? Mauricio Pochettino and Rodriguez could both be at Spurs next season

Hammers eye move for defender Peruzzi

West Ham are showing an interest in Catania right-back Gino Peruzzi.

The 21-year-old was due to sign for Sunderland last summer but the club pulled the plug on the deal as he had failed to recover sufficiently from a knee ligament operation.

Argentina international Peruzzi had flown to England and agreed personal terms but medical reports meant Sunderland did not want to take a chance and a £5m move from Velez Sarsfield was put on hold. Peruzzi, however, went on to prove his fitness and secured a move to Italy for £4million.

He has gone on to play 22 games this season but was sent off for a second bookable offence at the weekend.

Manager Sam Allardyce will hold a meeting with co-chairman David Sullivan tomorrow about the club's summer plans and will also find out about his own future.

If the club wish to change manager it may mean Peruzzi will stay in Italy. Allardyce has been looking for around six new players and is also considering the likes of Norwich City's Robert Snodgrass, AC Milan striker M'Baye Niang and Southampton target Aaron Cresswell at Ipswich Town.

One-time Allardyce target Josip Drmic at Nuremburg has signed for Bayer Leverkusen.

Norwich, Cardiff, Wolves and Boro keen on Huddersfield's Clayton

Huddersfield are struggling to hold on to highly-rated midfielder Adam Clayton.

The former Manchester City trainee has 12 months left on contract and is attracting a lot of attention from rival Championship clubs after another impressive season in which he was voted Huddersfield's player of the year.

Wanted man: Huddersfield's Adam Clayton celebrates scoring is attracting interest from a number of clubs

Huddersfield rejected a £1million offer from Brighton in January for a player they bought from Leeds for £350,000 in 2012. They want him to stay but the 25-year-old is ambitious and Brighton remain keen while Norwich, Cardiff, Wolves and Middlesbrough also have an interest.

Burnley set to move for Mallorca captain Nsue

Premier chance: Burnley could move for Emilio Nsue

Burnley could be poised to allow Real Mallorca captain Emilio Nsue to finally realise his Premier League dream.

The 24-year-old was due to sign for Arsenal in 2009 only for personal tragedy to shatter his hopes.

The former Spain U21 international had had his medical and was due to discuss terms with Arsenal when news came that his father had collapsed and died.

Nsue cancelled the move to be with his grieving family and returned to Mallorca. The highly-rated right winger was part of Spain's European Championship U21 winning squad in 2011 along side Juan Mata and David de Gea but has since opted to play for Equitorial Guinea in tribute to his late father.

Nsue, however, is now ready to make his mark in England and Burnley are among those to have shown interest with the possibility he can leave Mallorca for free. West Bromwich Albion have also shown an interest.

Sunderland, Spurs, Southampton, West Ham and Hull keen on Swansea's Taylor

Swansea defender Neil Taylor is in demand this summer as well as teammate Ben Davies.

The left-back who was the subject of a failed £4million bid from Fulham in January, is weighing up his next move ahead of a summer of change at Swansea.

Taylor, who has started 18 games this season, is keen to be playing more regularly and will discuss his future with Swansea boss Garry Monk over the coming weeks.

In demand: Neil Taylor could leave Swansea this summer

The 25-year-old has two years left on contract but has interest from Sunderland, Tottenham, Southampton, West Ham and Hull City.

Gosling set for Bournemouth move

Dan Gosling is expected to sign for Bournemouth over the coming days. The Championship side made their first approach for the Newcastle midfielder in March and are proposing a long term contract to persuade the 24-year-old to move back to the south coast.

Gosling, who began his career at Plymouth, has failed to reach his potential following his acrimonious move from Everton to Newcastle. He made 24 appearances this season including a loan spell at Blackpool where he scored two goals and has made four starts for Newcastle since returning in February.

Heading south: Dan Gosling is set to join Bournemouth

QPR keen on midfielder Sammir

Queens Park Rangers are planning ahead for the summer by watching Getafe midfielder Sammir.

The 27-year-old was born in Brazil but has been capped by Croatia and holds a Croatian passport.

An attacking midfielder, Sammir rose to prominence at Dinamo Zagreb where he replaced Luka Modric and scored 46 goals in 173 games.

Heading to England? Getafe's Jorge Sammir is being watched by QPR

He joined Getafe in February but is interested in a move to England with Getafe three points above the relegation zone with one game left.

QPR are expecting a high turnover of players this summer regardless of whether they go up or stay in the Championship. Sammir, full name Jorge Sammir Cruz Campos, is affordable at around £3million.

Blow for United as Reus commits future to Dortmund

Marco Reus has seemingly ruled out a summer move to Manchester United by insisting he is staying with Borussia Dortmund.

United were poised to bid for the 24-year-old who has a release clause of £27.5million. Yet in an interview with Kicker-Sportmagazin, he said: 'It's safe to say I will be playing for Borussia Dortmund also in the 2014/2015 season.

Staying put:  Marco Reus says he is staying at Dortmund

'Basically I do not need to stress all the time that I am feeling great being with the club. As far as leaving (Borussia Dortmund) that is no issue for me, and I am not affected by it (the transfer release clause).'
