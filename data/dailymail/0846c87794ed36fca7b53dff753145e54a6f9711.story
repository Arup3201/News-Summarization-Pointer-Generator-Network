Meet Britain’s most badly behaved pets which include a pug that climbs blinds, a cat that licks milk cartons, and a Labrador that shreds any doormat in sight.

Three hundred pets contended for the crown, but it was German Shepherd and Keeshond cross Yodie who was voted the naughtiest animal in a survey carried out by online blind firm Direct Blinds.

Owner Laura Vitty, 25, who is a teacher from Newcastle, said her beloved pet had caused hundreds of pounds worth of damage to her home.

Yodie, a German Shepherd and Keeshond cross was voted Britain's naughtiest pet after shredding these cushions up

She said: ‘When I first saw the mess Yodie had made, I actually thought it was scrambled egg, but it’s the inside of cushions.

‘It was all over the entire house - I was picking up bits of cushions for hours.’Yodie, who is a rescue dog, has a habit for shredding cushions but Miss Vitty says she loves him all the same.

She said: ‘This particular cushion attack occurred when he was very bored as he had to stay indoors for three weeks on vets orders.

‘Although he has chewed and destroyed his dog bed and countless other items, he is a lovely dog and I couldn’t be without him.’

Laura won a new blind and a £500 prize for her troubles.

Harry came second in the competition to find Britain's naughtiest pet for his newspaper shredding antics

A recent study found that pets are responsible for more than £1.2bn in damage to owners’ homes every year.

Dogs are the worst culprits, with 52 per cent damaged items put down to mutts wrecking the home when owners are out, with cats responsible for 40 per cent and the remaining eight per cent taken up by hamsters, rats, gerbils, rabbits, birds, snakes and micropigs.

Second place in the nationwide competition was claimed by a dog that loves to shred newspapers and magazines.

Harry, owned by Kyle and Kay Gregory, from Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, loves to leave a paper trail all over the house.

In third place came Stoops, a black cat owned by Sarah Bateman, which regularly opens the fridge and hops in to lick to top of the milk bottle at her home in Burnley.

Stoops the cat came third thanks to her habit of entering the fridge and licking the tops of milk cartons

In fourth place, Dolly the doormat destroyer caught red pawed by owner Sarah Fawcett from West Yorkshire
