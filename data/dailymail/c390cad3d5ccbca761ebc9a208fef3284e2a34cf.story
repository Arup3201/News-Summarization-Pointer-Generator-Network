Arrested: Margaret Henry, 48, is accused of running down her ex-husband's fiancee as the couple stood in a driveway, seriously injuring the woman

A 48-year-old woman has left her ex-husband's fiancee an amputee after allegedly driving across a Virginia front yard to mow her down.

Margaret Henry has been charged with malicious wounding after allegedly plowing a 2013 Hyuandai into the woman in a driveway.

Police found the unidentified victim 'entangled in the windshield' of the vehicle with major leg fractures.

NBC Washington, citing search warrants, reported Henry drove a car off Belmont Boulevard and across the front yard, hitting the woman as she stood with her fiance.

The car then reportedly hit a utility 
trailer before stopping near a tree.

Henry's ex-husband, who she divorced several years ago, restrained 
her until police arrived.

Emergency crews treated the victim at the scene before rushing her to Inova Fairfax Hospital.

The woman's lower leg had to be severed because her injuries were so severe.

Police investigators used the search warrant to get blood and other samples from the wrecked Hyundai.

Neighbors told NBC Washington Henry and her ex-husband used to have loud arguments when they were married.

'It
 was evil,' Delores Moseke said. 'I heard them screaming bloody 
murder, using foul language. She was tough. She was a tough bird.'

Jeanne Clapp said Henry, who moved to Triangle after her divorce, had a tumultuous relationship with her ex but didn't expect her to resort to violence.

'She hadn't said anything like, 'I'm going to go kill somebody'. She didn't say that,' Clapp said.

'My first feeling for a few days now has been shock. I would have never thought she'd do that.'

Clapp and her husband Don received permission to visit Henry next weekend in the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center.

Don Clapp, a chaplain, wants to take Henry a Korean bible.

'We wanted to remind her Jesus loves her and we love her and itâ€™s never too late to give your life to The Lord,' he said.

The Clapps said Henry mentioned having brothers in Korea, but they didn't know if she had relatives in the U.S.

Henry's next court date is February 24.
