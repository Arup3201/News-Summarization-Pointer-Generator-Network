Lille's on-loan midfielder Marcos Lopes would be keen to stay with the Ligue 1 club beyond the end of the season if he is not sure of regular playing time back at Manchester City.

Lopes, 19, is on a season-long loan with Les Dogues, making 19 appearances in all competitions to date.

'When I came to Lille I was hoping to get playing time, but this season has gone beyond my expectations,' Lopes told L'Equipe reporters.

'I feel really good now. I feel more responsibility. This is important, because it means they believe in me.'

Asked about his future plans, the playmaker added: 'I have a contract with Manchester City. But I feel at home at LOSC and it is possible I will stay. 

'What interests me is to be at a club where I can play. I have to make up my mind at the end of the season.'

Lopes is yet to appear in a Premier League match for City but made four cup appearances last season, having made his debut in the FA Cup in 2013.
