A critically ill nine-year-old boy whose body was ravaged by swine flu has finally received a kidney from his mother after doctors performed life-saving surgery, it emerged today.

Robert 'Boo' Maddox, from Louisiana, is currently recovering after the seven-hour surgery which was vital to save his life due to complications from the the H1N1 virus.

After contracting the virus - which killed more than 1,200 children in the U.S -  in 2009, he spent more than 500 days in hospital battling it and other infections.

At the time, machines were acting as his heart and 
lungs while he fought off near-fatal infections. His  pancreas and spleen were failing as were his kidneys, which could no longer filter his blood.

Boo had to undergo surgery to fuse a vein and artery in his arm to enable blood flow so he could easily receive dialysis treatments - a procedure known as arteriovenous fistula.

But as a result of this, the engorged vessel caused a blood pressure spike in his lungs, which meant a kidney transplant was not an option for him.

Dr Mikel Prieto, who performed the risky surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told ABC: 'He was told by many doctors that he was
not a candidate for a transplant. I talked to his dad and said, "I think maybe we can fix 
this".'

He found a way to reverse the fistula.

'It was scary in the sense of "I hope 
I'm right",' he said. 'It was bold, but it needed to be done to fix 
this problem.'

Boo would have died if the move had 
backfired. But the reverse procedure worked and the blood pressure in 
Boo's lungs dropped to a normal level, meaning he was ready for a kidney 
transplant.

Miraculously, both of his parents were matches, but because his mother Renee was the healthier of the two, his parents decided she would donate her kidney.

Renee is also recovering well from surgery and though it was a success, Boo suffered from a blood clot soon after which landed him back in intensive care.

But father Robert told ABC he is doing well and are putting their sons miraculous recovery down to God.

'We've had nowhere to turn but look up. People say every day, "I don't know how y'all do 
this". But the beauty is we don't do it alone.

'He's doing good now, talking to us. We've been to school [the last four years] on learning how wonderful life is and how each and every day is so important.'

He also revealed that Boo is looking forward to eating real food again as he has been fed through a tube since December 3.

'He watches the Food Channel every 
single day,' he said, noting that Boo's favorite show is the Food 
Network's Dinners, Drive-ins and Dives. 'He wrote down every place 
they've ever been and decided he's going.'

The nine-year-old might also be able to go to school for the first time since kindergarten.

'He's never been to school except for 
about two months,' he said.

'But he's sharp as a tack, taught himself to 
spell and write. I taught him to count money and tell time in an hour.'
