Spiked with lashings of spice for Scoville-shattering levels of searing heat, this is the pizza that chefs claim is the hottest in the world.

And after a notably dismal attempt at eating it, FEMAIL can confirm that tongue-tingling dish deserves the title.

Made with N'duja spicy sausage, chilli flakes and jalapeno powder, the eye-watering pie is the brainchild of executive chef Michael Lecouteur of Mayfair Pizza Co.

The Hottest Pizza has three of the hottest chillies in the world – Reapers, Scorpions and Scotch Bonnets – in its sauce

The Hottest Pizza, to give it its official name, also contains three of the hottest chillies in the world – Reapers, Scorpions and Scotch Bonnets – in its sauce.

While the N'duja sausage and pork rib  are not searingly spicy themselves, the base of the pizza packs a real punch.

Cult street food favourites, The Ribman's For The Love of God and Christ On a Bike hot sauces, raise the heat levels from a gentle tingle to a full-on burn.

The punchy pizza also comes adorned with an array of fiery toppings including chilli flakes, smoked jalapeno powder and sliced raw chilli.

The £14 pizza is the creation of executive chef Micheal Lecouteur of Mayfair Pizza Co. (pictured) 

The FEMAIL team could only manage two slices before our eyes began  watering and we started to need the accompanying side order of creamy burrata to ease the burn.

Ingredients: 70g tomato sauce; 22g The Ribman For The Love of God Chilli Sauce; 35grams pork rib; 22g N'duja spicy sausage; pinch of chilli flakes; 45g Scotch Bonnets; 60g Burrata; Smoked Jalapeno Powder; 20g Christ on A Bike sauce

Method: Tomato and chilli sauce is spread across the pizza base . Topped with pork rib, N'duja spicy sausage, a pinch of chilli flakes, scotch bonnets, smoked jalapeno powder and mozzarella. Cooked in the pizza oven at 500oC for three mins. Once removed it is finished with a Christ on a Bike Sauce, burrata and rocket. 

'I used to live on Brick Lane so naturally developed a taste for all things spicy,' explains Lecouteur.

'It was here I bought a lot of sauces from The Rib Man to use and experiment with at home.

'This led me to coming up with the Hottest Pizza for Mayfair Pizza Co. by combining two of The Rib Man's hottest sauces with our rustic, freshly-made Italian pizzas.

'Loaded with three of the world's hottest chillies — reaper, scorpion and scotch bonnets — it packs a fiery punch while still being enjoyable. Try it if you dare.'

The Hottest Pizza, which costs £14, is available until the end of August at Mayfair Pizza Co.

The modern Italian restaurant is famous for its sweet pizzas based on traditional desserts, among them Wild Strawberry, Limoncello and Lime, and Banana Tiramisu and Nutella Calzone

The news of the world's hottest pizza comes shortly after another London restauranteur attempted to create the world's hottest burger. 

Made from a slab of beef infused with ghost and cayenne peppers and pure chili extract, the burger is smothered with Hellfire Sauce before being served with habaneros and jalapenos relish.

The sizzling Hellfire Burger is the creation of Loren Gingrich, owner of Xtreme Smokehouse and Grill in Washington, Iowa.

It's so hot that Mr Gingrich has asked the Guinness Book of Records to create a new category for it.

Reportedly clocking in around 1,000,000 Scoville units (about half the burn of pepper spray), customers have to be over 18 to order the meal.

The burger arrives at the table with protective gloves, eyeswear and a waiver, which mentions the possibility of loss of life.
