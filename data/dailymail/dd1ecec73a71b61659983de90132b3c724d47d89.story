Incredible surveillance video shows a brazen band of robbers smashing a BMW into an Apple store and then frantically scooping up a haul of products.

But the September 6 heist at the Apple store in Temecula, California was a botched job from beginning to end - a masterclass in how not to rob a store.

Among other mishaps, the thieves got trapped in the store and the BMW’s license plate fell off and was left at the crime scene.

Charged: Alleged leader of the robbery, 22-year-old Equonne Howard, pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. Howard allegedly used his own BMW X5 to crash into the Apple store last Thursday

Smash and grab: Surveillance footage shows the BMW crashing into the Californian Apple store around 5am on September 6

The alleged leader of the gang, 22-year-old Equonne Howard, used his own 2003 BMW X5 to crash through the storefront’s glass and metal security gate around 5am last Thursday, police said.

Surveillance footage from inside the store shows a masked thief leap out of the car and sweep up as many iPods and iPads as he can.

Of course, Apple’s long-awaited iPhone 5 was not available to be swiped as it had not been released on the day the robbers struck.

The gang’s mine sweep was cut short after the store’s security gate dropped back down, trapping them and the BMW inside.

Shocking surveillance video shows the BMW repeatedly drive further into the store – smashing into tables of merchandise – then reverse back into the gate to ram through it.

The getaway was made all the harder as the car already had two flat tires from the initial break in.

After eventually escaping the Apple store, Howard allegedly stopped at a 7-Eleven where police say he stole some Fix-a-Flat, a product to mend flat tires.

Later that day, Howard returned to the Apple store to try and fetch his car’s license plate which had fallen off mid-robbery.

Police were waiting for Howard, who is already on parole for a previous robbery, and promptly arrested him. Howard had the BMW car keys in his pocket when he was arrested. 

Howard pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges of vandalism, burglary, and theft of electronics.

He is being held on  $600,000 bond, which authorities said was the estimated damage to the Apple store, which was still boarded up this week.

Three other suspects believed to have taken part in the robbery have not been identified.
