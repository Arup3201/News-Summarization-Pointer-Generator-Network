Defence chiefs have spent £440million on school fees for the children of soldiers and civil servants in four years despite making deep cuts to frontline forces.

Taxpayers’ money has been sent sending children to some of the country’s most exclusive schools including Harrow, Eton, Millfield, and Winchester.

It is the latest evidence of the perks and allowances funded by the state which have been spared the axe in the age of austerity.

Taxpayers money has been used to send children to Eton as part of a fund for forces personnel and Ministry of Defence staff posted overseas

Between 2009 and 2013 more than 23,000 staff claimed for school fees under the Continuity of Education Allowance.

The fund is used so that children can stay in education in the same school if their parents are forced to move around the globe as part of their work in the forces.

Over four years the Ministry of Defence spent £439,629,000 on the allowance.

It includes £3.7million of payments through the Boarding School Allowance (BSA), and covering on average 69 children a year.

Parents have to contribute at least 10 per cent towards the fees.

MoD civil servants can claim the BSA if they are working abroad and their children aged three to 18 in full time education.

The remaining £435.9million of payments was made through a Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA), which is available to forces personnel for children aged eight and over.

Parents are expected to contribute 10 per cent towards the boarding school fees.

The Ministry of Defence insisted it had made changes to the scheme which had so far saved £16million

The number of people claiming BSA has dipped from 6,020 in 2009-10 to 4,950 last year, while the total cost of CEA also fell from £111.3million to £98.8million.

The cost of BSA decreased from £972,260 to £903,289 over the same period, with the number of staff claiming the allowance down from 95 to 70.

An MOD Spokesperson said: ‘Service personnel should not be disadvantaged because of their duty and the Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA) makes sure Armed Forces children have continuity of education, regardless of where their parents are posted.

‘It is open to all ranks and we are determined that it should go only to those who really need it.

‘We tightened the regulations criteria in 2011 and 2013 which has resulted in savings of £16m.’

Last month it emerged how British taxpayers are forking out millions of pounds each year so that diplomats can continue to live the high life.

It included £14.9million on UK boarding school fees for diplomats’ children,  continuing to pay out long after their parents return from their postings overseas.

This is 14 per cent higher than at the last election, because every year the maximum fee that Foreign Office staff are allowed to charge rises well in excess of inflation.

The 442 staff enjoying the perk received an average of £33,769 each last year on top of their salary, allowing their children to go to top public schools such as Marlborough, Fettes and Roedean.

The UK’s embassies and consulates blew £8.8million on hospitality, allowing ambassadors to enjoy fine wines, good food and lavish parties at our expense.

This is 12 per cent higher than at the last election – even though the Coalition has demanded cuts across Whitehall.
