David Moyes has revealed that having overweight players in his Manchester United squad was the reason he banned chips.

The Real Sociedad boss, who was sacked by United in April last year after less than a season in charge, came in for criticism from Rio Ferdinand after removing chips from the players' menu.

But Moyes insists his decision was for the right reasons, even if some members of his squad weren't happy with their traditional pre-match meal being tampered with.

In an interview with FourFourTwo, Moyes said: 'Yes, I did ban chips.

'It was because a couple of players were overweight and I didn't think chips were good for their diet.'

In his autobiography #2sides, Ferdinand wrote that it was a 'ritual' to have 'low-fat chips the night before a game'.

The QPR defender, who left Old Trafford at the end of last season, also said the United players 'loved' their chips but within a week of taking charge Moyes had banned them 'for no good reason'.

Ferdinand claimed 'all the lads were p***** off' with the decision, while adding that chips returned to the menu as soon as Ryan Giggs took temporary charge after Moyes' departure. 

Midfielder Anderson, who left United to sign for Internacional on deadline day, had problems with his weight during his eight-year spell at Old Trafford.

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News shortly after Moyes' arrival in the summer of 2013, the Brazilian said: 'Training is hard under David Moyes but that's good for me. I need to train hard. I need to run and I'm feeling good, with power in my legs.

'I need to get fit and lose weight. I need to lose two more kilos to be at my best weight.'
