A drunk salesman threw himself to his death under the wheels of a three-tonne caravan while arguing with his girlfriend about whether she loved him, an inquest heard yesterday.

Dominic Goddard, 23, was trying to get a taxi with Kirsty Eastwood, also 23, after a work Christmas party - when he told her: ‘The next car that comes down here, I am going to let it run me over.’

Moments later he stepped in front of a Jaguar X-Type car towing a caravan. The driver avoided Mr Goddard, of Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, but he was hit by the caravan and dragged underneath.

He suffered fatal crush injuries and died at the scene. In the moments before his death, Mr Goddard had kept jumping into the road and at one point jumped onto the bonnet of a taxi.

Tests showed he would have been four times the drink-driving limit and had drunk the equivalent of 12 pints of beer or 21 single measures of spirits, Huddersfield Coroner's Court was told.

An inquest heard Mr Goddard, who worked for a recruitment company, indulged in a weekend ‘drinking culture’. Tragedy struck on Boxing Day 2013 when he went to a party with Miss Eastwood.

She told the hearing: ‘He seemed fine, absolutely fine when we first got there. I was tired and didn’t really know anyone at the party but once I said I would go he was absolutely fine.

‘He took four beers and had some vodka there. But at some point he started to get emotional and started saying he did not think I loved him and did not feel the same way about him.

'I just told him to calm down.’  Miss Eastwood left Mr Goddard for 15 minutes but found him still agitated and upset on her return.

She added: ‘He came into the living room and said to his friend that he needed to make more of an effort to be friends with me or he didn’t want anything to do with him.

'I love you': Miss Eastwood said she told her boyfriend to 'calm down' when he was agitated

‘Everyone was getting upset now and one of the girls said she would take me home but I didn’t want to leave if while he was like that.’

Eventually she decided they should both head home and called a taxi. But as the pair walked along a road in to meet their taxi, Mr Goddard kept asking Miss Eastwood ‘do you actually love me?’

Miss Eastwood added: ‘He was shouting and he kept jumping in the road and then would come back to the pavement. He was all over the place.’

As they were walking along the road in Gomersal, a village next to Cleckheaton, he jumped on the bonnet of an oncoming taxi before jumping off. The taxi driver inspected his car for damage and drove off.

Miss Eastwood said: ‘I shouted for him to come back to me when I saw the car coming down. He was at the side of the road and just ran in.

‘At this point I just started to try and calm him down saying “I love you, I need you to calm down.” But he kept saying he was fed up of how people thought of him.

‘I saw the caravan coming down the road and he was standing at my side at this point but as it came closer he sort of moved into the road. There was no warning. He suddenly moved out.

‘He had a clear view of it coming. It all happened so quickly. He was stuck underneath. It was horrific. I think it was an attention seeking thing.

‘He had that much to drink, he wasn’t thinking straight. He had done this before and it was for attention then as well.’

Eyewitness Helen Kilroy told the inquest: ‘I saw the couple walking up the pavement on the far side of the road. He was shouting and at that time I could not hear the words.

‘He began to randomly run into the road and back onto the pavement. He was shouting at the female.’

She said as Mr Goddard and Miss Eastwood walked further up the road toward her house she heard Mr Goddard say ‘I am a fat, black, ugly and psycho.’

Ms Kilroy added: ‘I remember it was strange as he was slim, white and tall. The female was very distressed and he was not in control of his emotions.

Horrific: Miss Eastwood said the incident leading to her boyfriend's death 'all happened so quickly'

‘The shouting continued and I heard him say “the next car that comes down here I am going to let it run me over”. When I heard that my heart started to pound in my chest as I didn’t know what was going to happen.

‘I saw lights coming down the road through the trees and seconds later there was an almighty bang. It was shocking.’

A toxicology report revealed Mr Goddard had 325 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 80mg.

Mr Goddard’s co-worker Nicola Teale, who hosted the Christmas party, said: ‘Toward the end of the night Dominic appeared to be talking to Kirsty. The two moved to the kitchen. The discussion seemed to turn from a discussion to an argument but it wasn’t a shouting argument.

'Dominic can be emotional at times but he appeared in good spirits. It was unusual to see him having an argument with his girlfriend.’

The hearing was told Mr Goddard had ‘lost it’ during a previous row with his girlfriend when he stood in the road threatening that ‘I might as well get hit’, only to move to safety when a car approached.

In a statement, his father Mark Goddard said: ‘Dominic was involved in a binge drinking culture. He wouldn’t usually drink during the week whilst at work but at weekends he would drink to excess.

‘Every so often he would get into a situation where he had to call his brother because he was drinking and could not look after himself.’

The hearing was told Jaguar driver Terence Stocks, who was on his way to Spain with his wife for three months, could not avoid a collision.

PC James Harrison said: ‘He had seen Mr Goddard jump in and out of the road and in order to give him as much space he move across on the opposite carriageway, making as much space as he could.

‘He was travelling at 25mph and heard a 
bang and knew that his caravan had hit Dominic. He got out and checked 
and found Dominic trapped under the caravan and got his wife to phone 
the emergency services.’

'He had a clear view of it coming. It all happened so quickly. He was stuck underneath. It was horrific'

Recording a conclusion of accidental death, assistant coroner Mary Burke said: ‘Although Dominic intentionally took this act, I am satisfied this was not an intentional act on Dominic’s part to take his life.

‘Dominic would undertake acts intended to provoke a reaction. He was in a highly charged emotional state and found it very difficult to control his emotions.

‘In addition the level of alcohol in his system would have affected his ability to think clearly. He did not appreciate what tragic consequences would unfold.’

Soon after his death at 1.30am on December 27, Miss Eastwood said in a tribute on Facebook: ‘Words can’t describe how much I miss my boy. I might have only known him six months, but we shared so much together and I know we’d have been together so much longer.

‘We had so many things planned for next year and I can’t believe he’s gone. Waking up and looking at my phone knowing I’ll never have my morning text from you is the hardest feeling.’
