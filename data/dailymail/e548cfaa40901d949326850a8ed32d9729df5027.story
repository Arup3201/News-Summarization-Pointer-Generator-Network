President Barack Obama announced his intention today to send up to 300 U.S. military advisers into Iraq to help train the country's military.

The president expressly stated that the move does not 'foreshadow' a military intervention and said sending troops back into Iraq to fight radical extremists would not benefit the U.S.

'American forces will not be returning to combat in Iraq,' Obama said, ' but we will help Iraqis as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the Iraqi people, the region and American interests, as well.'

The president also said the U.S. was currently ‘identifying targets’ associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorist group and that the U.S. would take ‘targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it' - an obvious nod to air strikes.

President Barack Obama announced today that the U.S. would send in up to 300 soldiers to train and advise the Iraqi military. American forces still won't be engaging in combat he promised

After meeting with national security advisers early this afternoon, the president said in a statement that the U.S. intended would coordinate with Iraqi security forces, put up joint operation centers in Baghdad and share intelligence with the Iraqi government.

Already, the president had deployed 275 armed marines to protect State Department personnel working at the embassy in Baghdad.

He had also sent the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier with 
its usual battleship escort, the USS Mesa Verde, an amphibious transport 
ship that can carry 550 marines and helicopters and armed F-18 Super Hornet warplanes to do surveillance.

Obama told members of Congress during a meeting on Wednesday that he did not need their permission to take the actions he was considering.

However, he said on Thursday that he would continue to work with Congress to provide additional equipment to the Iraqi military through his newly created Counterterrorism Partnership Fund and that he would consult Congress, as well as Iraqi leaders, if he decided to pull the trigger on air strikes.

Iraqi
 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, has asked President Obama for air 
strikes against the Sunni Islamist militants who have been carving a 
wide swath through his country, but Obama has been slow to comply.

The President told congressional leaders yesterday that the U.S. does not have strong enough intelligence at this time to carry out the strikes, an aide with knowledge of the discussion told the Huffington Post yesterday.

Obama also expressed anxiety about the number of civilian casualties that the strikes could cause, as well concerns about instability within Iraq's government.

The president said last week that he would not provide Iraq with military assistance until the country's leaders made serious moves toward putting their sectarian differences aside.

Vice President Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday with Maliki, the country's Sunni parliamentary speaker and the the 
president of the country's self-ruled Kurdish region.

He
 praised their efforts to bring together their respective communities in
 a televised show of unity against ISIS, the White House said.

Lawmakers
 have been putting pressure on Obama to call for Maliki's resignation 
for days, and the Associated Press said reported Thursday morning that 
Obama might ask Maliki to resign as a Hail Mary effort to stop the 
country's civil war.

However, Obama repeatedly said on Thursday, 'It's not the place for the United States to choose Iraq's leaders.'

There
 is an 'urgent' need for Iraq to convene a new parliament that gives all
 Iraqis the sense that they are part of a unity government, though, Obama said.

'Right now what is happening is the fate of Iraq hangs in the balance.'

The U.S. president hedged when asked at a presser Thursday after his statement if he had lost faith in Maliki to lead
 the country and referred back to his previous statements.

US President Barack Obama meets with Congressional leadership including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (2nd R), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (L), House Speaker John Boehner (2nd L), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R), in the Oval Office of the White House on June 18, 2014 in Washington, DC. The leaders met to discuss strategy on Iraq

Former U.S. general David Petraeus, 
who led the 'surge' that finally brought calm to Iraq, struck a cautious
 note on Western intervention on Wednesday.

Speaking
 at a conference in London, General Petraeus said the Iraqi government 
needed to reach out to the Sunni minority before the US got involved 
militarily.

He said: 'If
 the US is to support the Iraqi government it would have to be a 
government against terrorism, rather than one side in a civil war.'

'This
 cannot be the United States being the air force for Shia militias, or a
 Shia on Sunni Arab fight,' he told the Margaret Thatcher Conference on 
Liberty.

President Obama 
expressed concern at doing just that on Thursday and again called on 
Iraq's government to come together to fight the common treat to their 
nation.

He also fired a warning shot at Iran.

The
 U.S. welcome's the country to play a 'constructive role' in Iraq, he 
said, but 'If Iran is coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of 
the Shia, and it is framed in that fashion, that probably worsens the 
situation.'

'Obviously 
what has happened in Syria in part is the result of Iran coming in hot 
and heavy' on one side, Obama said, referring to the upheaval in that 
country.

Obama said he hopes Iran will take a 'more promising path' in Iraq, 'but old habits die hard.'

Yesterday's surveillance missions mark the first declared U.S. flyovers since American troops left Iraq at the end of 2011.

Reports 
first surfaced on Twitter from ABC, NBC and Fox News about the sorties, 
which are taking off and landing on the USS George H.W. Bush, an 
aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf.

The Obama administration had already authorized 'manned and unmanned' surveillance flights, Fox News reported. But F-18s are not surveillance aircraft.

They are attack planes.

A
 U.S. official hinted to Fox that part of the strategy is to project 
strength by rolling out the big guns even on routine video and photo 
missions.

'It's not so much about looking as it is being seen,' the official said.

The White 
House told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that the president is still 
undecided about whether to commit military force to the country that 
once hosted 143,000 American servicemen and women.

Obama said on Thursday that he would prefer Iraq's neighbors in the region step up instead.

On that note Obama said he would be sending Secretary of State John Kerry to the Middle East and Europe to meet with the U.S.'s allies abroad about working together to quell the violence in Iraq.

'Rather than play whack-a-mole where these terrorist networks pop up,' the president said, the U.S. has to be able to build effective partnerships.
