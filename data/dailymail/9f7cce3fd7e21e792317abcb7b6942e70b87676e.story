'The Werewolf': Former police officer Mikhail Popkov (pictured) murdered at least 24 women who reportedly looked like his mother

A former policeman known as a 'perfect husband and father' led a secret life as serial killer who murdered at least two dozen women in Siberia.

Mikhail Popkov axed, stabbed or strangled full-figured women 'who resembled his mother' who allegedly abused him in childhood, it was revealed today.

Russian investigators say the 49-year-old has confessed to 24 murders, though police suspect him of at least 29 and crime experts fear even more.

Nicknamed variously The Werewolf and the Wednesday Murderer - after the day of the week when many of his victims were found in forests - he eluded police for two decades as investigators catastrophically ignored evidence that the mystery killer could be one of their own officers who used his uniform to gain trust.

The father of one - who faces life in jail - selected victims who resembled his mother, say Russian reports of the case, which is centred on Angarsk in the Irkutsk region of Siberia.

Police earlier said that of the 29 he was suspected of killing, 25 were aged 19 to 28, and four were from 35 to 40.

'He beheaded at least one woman and gouged the heart out of a victim,' reported The Siberian Times.

'Popkov claimed he suddenly stopped killing after he "became impotent", suggesting a sexual motive to his murder spree.

'Typically, his victims were slightly intoxicated when he lured them to their deaths.

'He snared them after they had been to bars or parties. He is suspected of seeking revenge on his mother who was an alcoholic and allegedly abused him in his childhood.'

Victim: Viktoria Chagaeva holds a picture of her 20-year-old sister Tanya Martynova, who was killed by Popkov after attending a concert with a friend in 1998

Investigators have established his killing spree lasted from 1992 until at least 2000, but have been unable to prove any killings since then.

Popkov was finally arrested in June 2012 after around 3,500 police officers, serving and retired, were forced to take DNA tests.

He told officers: 'I just felt I wanted to kill a woman I was giving a lift to in my car.'

The Siberian Times goes on to say: 'He murdered the women with a slipknot, knife, awl, screwdriver or an axe which he used up to 17 times on some victims.

'He used his police uniform and car to gain the trust of at least some of his victims.'

Tragedy: Tanya's mother Lubov (pictured with Tanya's daughter) died aged 66 in 2007 after becoming overcome with grief following her daughter's death

Only one victim, known only as Svetlana M, escaped his brutal attack when he left her for dead naked in the snow in midwinter.

She told how an officer in a police car gave her a lift, then took her to the forest where he forced her to strip before crashing her head against a tree trunk.

The police did not investigate properly after Popkov's wife Elena, now 47, who claimed he was a perfect husband and father, gave him an alibi.

Innocent: Yulia Kuprikova, who was murdered with her friend Tanya Martynova

She also served in the police, and the couple have a daughter Ekaterina, now 26, a schoolteacher.

Former policeman Nikolai Kitaev, who has criticised the handling of the case, said that Svetlana M was shown a picture of Popkov 'and clearly confirmed it was him' but investigators chose to believe Popkov's wife.

Kitaev is convinced there are at least a dozen more cases in police files that are likely to be Popkov's victims. Many of the details from the crime scenes match his modus operandi, he said.

After leaving the force, Popkov became
 a security officer but bought and sold cars on the side, and frequently
 travelled to and from Vladivostok on Russia's Pacific coast.

'He had plenty of opportunity for other killings but this has not been checked by police,' said one source.

Earlier,
 as policed fumbled to find the killer, a detective predicted that they 
must be dealing with someone who 'is charming and sociable. Women like 
him but he is a beast inside, and it is always hard to fight a 
werewolf.'

Tatiana (Tanya) Martynova, 20, was found dead with her friend Yulia Kuprikova, 19, on 29 October 1998 in an Angarsk suburb.

'It
 happened 15 years ago, but the pain does not go away - it was me who 
gave Tanya a ticket to go to a concert, and she was killed after 
attending it,' said her sister Viktoria Chagaeva, 46, who owns a beauty 
salon in Angarsk.

Tanya was married with a child and was having a rare night out. Their bodies were found by a shepherd.

'It was 1am when Tanya's husband Igor and I came to the police,' she said.

'Igor was absolutely devastated and only repeated - "She was killed, she was killed".

'I was shocked too, but I simply could not believe it and replied - "what are you talking about?"

'Later, we were told that their bodies were found next to each other, both girls were raped, cut and chopped.'

Popkov has also been accused of raping the corpses of his victims.

Chagaeva added: 'The experts told us that at first they were killed then raped.

'My elder brother Oleg went to the morgue to identify Tanya. He had flown from Moscow immediately.

'He
 felt sick when saw the body, she was so mutilated. He was almost green 
when he came out of there - he just could not say a word.

'I did not dare to go in and look.'

After the concert, the two women had been for a drink. Like almost all his victims, he targeted women who had taken alcohol.

Their mother Lubov died early, aged 66 in 2007, unable to cope with the trauma, she said. 

'She
 felt as if she had died with Tanya, life became useless for her. She 
lived only because she was visiting various mediums one by one, looking 
for the killer and wasting her money.

'Nobody gave her any serious information but she kept doing it.'

After
 Popkov's arrest last year, Viktoria realised she vaguely knew the 
killer. They had both been involved in biathlon at the same sports 
ground.

'I was stuck with horror when I saw the picture of this maniac in the paper and online,' she said.

'My sister's killer was looking into my eyes. I immediately felt as if I'd met him. Looking at him, I could hardly breathe.

'Some
 minutes later I looked at him another time and thought - oh my God, I 
know him. I was so shocked, I even took a knife and cut his face in the 
newspaper, I needed to let this horror out of me.

'I remember him as a tall slim man, he was always alone, with a slippery and shifty glance.'

Dmitry,
 a former police colleague of Popkov's, said: 'When I read about him in 
the press I literally choked, because I used to work with him and 
thought I knew him.

'He was an absolutely normal man... he liked biathlons... once on duty he shot a rapist during an arrest. There was an investigation and he was not punished, the chiefs considered he had taken fair action.'

Angarsk psychiatrist Alexander Grishin said: 'The fact that only drunk women attracted him could be the result of his childhood problems and associations - his mother used to drink alcohol and often abused him.

'Maybe in his childhood other drunk women abused him too, and all this affected his behaviour later in his adult life and led to such horrible consequences.'

Among Popkov's other victims were Maria Molotkova, 20, who worked at a water pumping station in Angarsk. She was found dead in the forest after going missing on 17 August 1999.

Friends Marina Lyzhina, 35 and Lilia Pashkovskaya, 37, were buried on 8 June 2000 after he picked them up in his police car in the middle of the night as they were returning from a night out.
