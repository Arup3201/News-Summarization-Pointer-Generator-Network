Motorists waste up to 66 hours a year in traffic jams, a study shows.

Britain’s drivers spend an average of 32 hours annually in gridlock. But while London has the longest delays, it is beaten by Manchester for having the worst jams.

This is because researchers measured not just the length of delay but also the ‘intensity’ of gridlock and the degree to which it is greater than normal free-flow traffic conditions.

Gridlock: Britain's drivers spend an average of 32 hours annually in traffic jams, data from traffic information company INRIX showed

Manchester drivers suffer congestion 24.8 per cent worse than normal and waste 45 hours a year. The worst period is 9am to 10am on a Tuesday.

London drivers suffer jams that are 23.8 per cent worse than normal, but endure 66 hours a year of delay.

Liverpool is third with jams 21.3 per cent worse and delays of 39 hours, followed by Belfast at 20.6 per cent worse and 34 hours of gridlock.

The best day for traffic is Monday – especially in the afternoon – found traffic information company INRIX.

Across Europe, Britain is fourth for jams behind Belgium (55 hours), Holland (50 hours) and Italy (29 hours).

Nationwide, the worst time to be on the roads was in London between 4pm and 5pm, when it took an average of 33 per cent longer to complete a journey than in uncongested conditions.

Overall, a journey along a UK major motorway during peak-time driving hours took, on average, 17 per cent longer than in jam-free conditions.

Among UK cities, the biggest decline in hours wasted in traffic last year was in Birmingham, where drivers spent eight hours less in queues than in 2010.

Londoners spent seven hours less, with drivers in Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham and Glasgow all spending five hours less.

For European countries, the biggest drops in congestion between 2010 and 2011 were in Portugal (down 49 per cent), Ireland (down 25 per cent), Spain (down 12 per cent) and Italy (down 12 per cent).

INRIX Europe senior vice president Stuart Marks said: 'So goes traffic, so goes the economy.

'Traffic congestion is an excellent economic indicator telling us whether people are going to work, businesses are shipping products and consumers are spending money.'
