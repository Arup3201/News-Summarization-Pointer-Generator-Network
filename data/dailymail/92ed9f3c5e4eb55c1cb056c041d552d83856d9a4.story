Newcastle have made provisions for Papiss Cisse and Cheick Tiote returning from international duty in Africa in light of the Ebola outbreak.

Cisse and Tiote have been representing Ivory Coast and Senegal respectively during Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers this week.

And with the deadly virus having killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa, United manager Alan Pardew says precautions have been taken for their players.

Manager Alan Pardew says the club would be naive not to take precautions following the Ebola outbreak

‘We'd be naive not to have concerns,’ he said.

‘We have a strategy for when they return and making sure they and their families are taken care of.

‘They're essential to us and our doctor has looked into the problems that might arise and also protection for them and to make sure we do our very best to help them.’

There has been a suggestion that January’s finals in Morocco could be postponed should the virus not be contained.

And Pardew added: ‘That's something that will play out as we go along. That kind of decision is a big, big one and I'm sure the countries will make that rather than club managers.

‘It's something to be concerned about and we have to be on our guard.’

Tiote was part of the Ivory Coast side which won 2-1 away to DR Congo on Saturday before losing 4-3 against the same opponents on Wednesday.

Cisse, meanwhile, drew 0-0 with Tunisia in Dakar before losing 1-0 in the return fixture.

And Pardew, whose side remain in the bottom three and face Leicester on Saturday, went on: ‘The two boys who travelled to Africa are not back yet but reports are that they're both well.

‘We're pleased about that, particularly for Cheick who had a tough game and Ivory Coast were down to 10 men for most of the second half.

‘We'll have be careful with him. It'll just be a warm down for him. Tactically it's difficult for all the managers but we'll try and cram in as much as we can on Friday before the game.

‘Of course it's a worry when you've got players such a long way away, you're just looking at your phone hoping no messages come thorough that are negative. We've been lucky this time around.’
