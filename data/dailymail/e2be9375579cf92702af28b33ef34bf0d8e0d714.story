BBC Radio 3 has been accused of dumbing down as it suffered its lowest ratings during a Proms season for 15 years.

The classical music channel normally benefits from a ratings boost during its summer concert season but saw its weekly listening figures slump by almost six per cent in a year.

This year’s proms featured a performance by the Pet Shop Boys and soul singer Laura Mvula alongside its more traditional fare of Brahms and Beethoven.

But the populist programme failed to boost the station’s ratings. In the three months to the end of September it attracted a weekly audience of 1.9million, down from 2million in the third quarter of last year.

Although the figure was a slight rise on the number who watched in the second quarter of this year, the total number of listening hours, 11.2million, was the smallest for a Proms season.

Radio 3’s former controller, Roger Wright, stepped down from his post in March. He was hit by repeated accusations that the channel had been dumbed down to compete with commercial rivals by scheduling a lighter repertoire including more soundtracks.

Classic FM also saw its listening figures drop in the last quarter, to 5.2million, down from 5.3million at the same time last year.

BBC insiders insisted the main reason for the reduced listening figures was that it had encouraged more listeners to tune in online via its mobile apps and iPlayer service, which are not included in the quarterly listening figures.

But spokesman for lobby group Friends of Radio 3: ‘Radio 3’s current editorial strategy didn’t stand much chance of retaining the station’s audience, still less building it up.’

Earlier this month, culture minister Ed Vaizey revealed at the Radio Festival that he never listens to Radio 3. Asked why not, he said: ‘Because I love Classic FM, it’s an absolutely brilliant station I love it, it plays lovely music and is run by an amazing person.

‘What’s wrong with Radio 3? That’s a real half empty question. The question is what’s right with Classic FM? It plays music I love in an accessible and informal fashion.’

The incoming Radio 3 controller Alan Davey insisted he would not be ‘dumbing down’ the station and could dontinue to offer highbrow programmes to his listeners.

He said: ‘It’s one quarter’s listening figures we are talking about. We don’t yet have a trend. I will be addressing it by doing what Radio 3 does best – offering complex culture, arts and ideas within the reach of lots of people.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The station has never chased ratings and its audience has fluctuated around 2 million since records began. Recent listening figures are consistent with this trend and we have also seen on-demand listening and audience appreciation at record levels.’
