A seven-year-old girl who became Beijing’s first human case of the new strain of bird flu has been discharged from hospital today.

A daughter of poultry traders, she was the first confirmed case of H7N9 virus in the Chinese capital, but has made a full recovery, state authorities said.

The new strain of avian flu has claimed 16 lives since the outbreak two weeks ago, with the 78th human case of H7N9 virus confirmed in China today.

The seven-year-old waved at the cameras in what appears to have been an attempt by health officials to calm the bird flu panic spreading across eastern China.

Both the girl and her parents, who have been in quarantine with her, wore face masks at Wednesday’s press conference, something which health officials claim was a measure taken to protect their identities.

The seven-year-old told press she feels ‘much better’, and added that: ‘I miss home. I want to go back and play,' The Australian reported.

Her remarkable recovery was marred by the news that two more people have died from a new strain of avian influenza, bringing the death toll to 16.

The latest victims were from the 
commercial capital of Shanghai, where the majority of the 78 cases have 
been found, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The exact source of infection remains unknown and no human-to-human spread of the virus has been confirmed.

Samples have tested positive in some birds in poultry markets that remain the focus of investigations by China and the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

‘Because the source of the infection has 
not been effectively controlled, it is possible that the number of cases
of infections could continue to rise,’ Xinhua said, quoting a risk 
assessment of the virus by the National Health and Family Planning 
Commission.

Zeng Guang, the chief scientist in charge of epidemiology at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre (CDPCC), said about 40 per cent of the victims have no clear history of poultry exposure, the Beijing News newspaper reported on Wednesday.

‘How did these people get infected? It's a mystery,’ Zeng said.

An analysis on Tuesday confirmed only ten out of the then 77 victims had 
contact with poultry.

The latest outbreak of bird flu has had dire consequences for the country’s poultry industry.

The term Typhoid Mary refers to Mary Mallon, the first confirmed asymptomatic, or healthy, carrier of typhoid fever in the US.

She is presumed to have infected more than 50 people between 1900 and 1907 when she worked as a cook in New York, and between quarantines later in life.

She was quarantined three times before she died in 1938, not from typhoid, but pneumonia.

The
sector has recorded losses of 10billion yuan (£1.06billion) as Chinese 
shun eating chicken and duck in fear of catching H7N9.

Authorities 
have slaughtered thousands of birds and closed live poultry markets in 
Shanghai and Beijing in an attempt to reduce the rate of human 
infection.

An international 
team of flu experts will go to China this week to help with 
investigations into the virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said 
yesterday.

China said on 
Sunday the virus had spread outside the Yangtze River delta region in 
eastern China, with cases reported in the capital Beijing and the 
central province of Henan.
