The Israeli military committed war crimes during the final days of its war against Gaza this summer, according to Amnesty International.

The destruction of four multi-storey buildings during the last four days of the 50-day conflict was carried out 'deliberately and with no justification', officials said.

The human rights organisation said the bombings amounted to 'a collective punishment against the people of Gaza' designed to destroy livelihoods, rather than take out military targets.

Israeli warplanes also dropped large bombs on the 12-storey Zafer 4 Tower (above), said the Amnesty report

Amnesty is now calling for a team to be allowed into the country to investigate the alleged crimes, and says the perpetrators should be brought before a court. 

More than 2,100 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed in the war between Israel and Hamas-led militants, which ended on August 26. Another 11,000 were injured.

On the Israeli side 73 people were killed, 67 of them soldiers.

One of the buildings destroyed was the Municipal Commercial Centre in Rafah, which contained a shopping mall, a medical clinic and offices.

All told, the businesses inside provided livelihoods for hundreds of Palestinian people.

Residents were warned an attack was about to take place by telephone calls and 'knock on the roof' missiles - a small bomb dropped on the top of a building in advance of a larger warhead.

However, the report said people were not given enough time to clear important belongings out.

When the attack came, the blast was large enough to destroy the entire building along with neighbouring homes, injuring dozens of people.

Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Philip Luther, said Israel had a responsibility to chose a method of attack that would minimise civilian casualties.

He added: 'The Israeli army have previously conducted air strikes on specific apartments in high-rise buildings without their complete destruction.'

Israeli authorities tried to justify the attack by saying that one building housed a command centre of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, and that another had 'facilities linked to Palestinian militants'.

Israeli warplanes also dropped large bombs on the 12-storey Zafer 4 Tower, the 16-storey Italian Complex and the 13-storey al-Basha Tower in Gaza City.

The blasts at the high-rises were so large they damaged surrounding buildings and injured dozens. Amnesty said Israel has weapons that allow it to target specific parts of a building, but did not use them 

Amnesty said that it asked Israel to list the justifications for carrying out each separate attack, but that officials failed to provide an adequate response.

According to the BBC, the Israeli embassy in London accused the report of ignoring Hamas' use of the buildings for military purposes, and made unfounded allegations.

Diplomats said Amnesty should be investigating Palestinian rockets launched at their civilians. 

Jerusalem has refused to cooperate with a United Nations inquiry into possible war crimes during the conflict, accusing it of bias.

The Israeli army has launched a series of criminal investigations into incidents in the war, including the shelling of a UN school that medics said killed at least 15 people and the bombing of a beach where four children died.

Critics, however, have said that the investigations by Israel will not be independent.
