The NBC News crew exposed to Ebola were forced into mandatory quarantine after chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman violated their voluntary isolation to visit her favorite soup restaurant, reports revealed.

The 62-year-old was one of seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days on Friday as doctors treat the station's cameraman Ashoka Mukpo for the deadly disease.

It emerged this weekend that the crew would have been allowed more freedom if it weren't for Snyderman's alleged trip to Peasant Grill in Hopewell Boro, New Jersey, last Thursday.

Ventured out: Nancy Snyderman violated her voluntary isolation to visit her favorite soup kitchen, according to reports

Witnesses claimed Snyderman arrived at Peasant Grill in Hopewell Boro, New Jersey, wearing shades

Witnesses claimed the physician and broadcaster wore sunglasses with her hair in a ponytail as she pulled up outside the restaurant and a man dashed in to grab the order, according toTMZ.

The website confirmed today the man who ran inside was a member of the NBC crew who was also under quarantine.   

Nancy Snyderman and NBC News had yet to respond on Monday to MailOnline's requests for comment. 

 Dr Snyderman is said to be a regular at the restaurant and has often used their catering service. 

The team had initially been encouraged to isolate themselves following Mukpo's diagnosis.

The group was reporting on the Ebola outbreak for NBC News in Liberia when Mukpo was diagnosed with the deadly virus just a day after he was hired to work on the team.

However, someone in the NBC crew violated the voluntary agreement forcing New Jersey officials to step in and issue a mandatory quarantine order on Friday night.

The cameraman was infected in West Africa but is being treated in Nebraska.

Mr Mukpo returned to Twitter on Monday to thank well-wishers for the 'good vibes' and say that he was feeling better. It also emerged this weekend that the freelance cameraman was facing half a million dollars in medical bills.

A page on charity fundraising site, Gofundme, revealed he had raised close to $48,000 towards the cost of his treatment.  

A spokesman for NBC said the network could not comment on any individual case, but noted that the team was deemed to be low-risk upon its return from Liberia.

He added that they had agreed to follow the guidelines set by local health authorities which included the 21-day isolation period.

He said: 'We fully support those guidelines and continue to expect that they be followed.

'Our team are all well with normal temperatures, which they check multiple times a day, and they are also in daily contact with local health officials.'

Meanwhile, in a phone interview with the Today show last week, Dr Snyderman said all the gear she and her crew used was being disinfected because they all shared work space and vehicles.

The State Health Department insisted the rest of Mukpo's crew remains symptom-free and there is no reason for concern of exposure to the deadly virus to the community as further diagnoses are revealed

She also said that she believed she and her team were at a low risk because they have been 'hyper-vigilant'.

Hospitals across the U.S. remained on high alert on Monday over the outbreak of Ebola.

Despite wearing protective clothing, a nurse in Texas was diagnosed this weekend with the disease after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first man to be diagnosed in the U.S.

Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas was one of the team of medical staff at Texas Health Presbyterian where she treated Mr Duncan. 

She is now being kept in isolation at the same hospital and is said to be in a stable condition.

Around 150 travelers per day from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will now be stopped and checked with contactless thermometers at JFK Airport in New York in an attempt to prevent the disease getting into the United States again.

The 2014 Ebola outbreak has been most prevalent in three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and smaller outbreaks have been reported in both Senegal and Nigeria.

The new scheme will be expanded over the next week to Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport.
