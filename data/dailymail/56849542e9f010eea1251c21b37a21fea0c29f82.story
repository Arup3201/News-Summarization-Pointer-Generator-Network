Passionate: Prince Albert, writing in German on November 15, 1839, told his 20-year-old fiancée he dreamed of the moment their hands touched

A passionate love letter Prince Albert sent to Queen Victoria describing his all-consuming desire will be unveiled for the first time.

He describes how her beauty burned his 'whole soul', and how he dreams of the moment their hands touched.

The German royal had returned to Coburg in Germany for a few weeks to settle his affairs before their wedding on February 10, 1840.

But it seems even a moment from his 20-year-old fiancée was unbearable.

The poetic note, dated November 15, 1839, told her: 'I need not tell you that since we left, all my thought have been with you at Windsor, and that your image fills my whole soul.

'Even in my dreams I never imagined that I should find so much love on earth.

'How that moment shines for me still when I was close to you, with your hand in mine. Those days flew by so quickly, but our separation will fly equally so.'

In May, more than 174 years later, the heartfelt exchange between two of the nation's most revered leaders in history is set to be displayed at the Drawings Gallery in Windsor Castle.

It is one of a number exchanged by the besotted young leaders in the months after Victoria proposed.

The couple, first cousins, met in England on Princess Victoria's 17th birthday in May 1836 at the suggestion of her Belgian uncle King Leopold I.

A year later, her uncle, William IV died,
 and the 18-year-old rose to throne. She would become Britain's 
longest-serving monarch to date.

Historic: It is an unprecedented revelation of the emotional exchanges between two of the nation's most revered leaders. The first cousins are pictured here in 1845, five years after their marriage

Love: Victoria, here with Albert at their wedding in February 1840, proposed on their second meeting

The defiant young ruler was determined to stand strong and alone, but the next time she met Albert, in late 1839, she was moved by his beauty, and asked for his hand on October 15.

The letter, written in his native German, Victoria's first language, shows Albert's unwavering emotion was just as strong.

It starts: 'Theuerste innigst geliebtre Victoria,' which translates as: 'Dearest, deeply loved Victoria'.

Albert's letter to 'deeply loved Victoria' (pictured left as a newlywed and right 15 years later) says her image fills his 'whole soul' and explains he has been ill. The document will be exhibited in Windsor Castle in May

Amidst the impassioned words, he also sends love from his brother, Ernest, and explains he fell ill on the boat ride.

Lauren Porter, the curator of the exhibition, told the Sunday Telegraph the letter 'provides a fascinating personal insight into the depth of Prince Albert’s thoughts and feelings for his bride-to-be'.

She added: 'Such a heartfelt expression of love and devotion is particularly striking as it sits in contrast to the popular idea of the Victorian era being a period of emotional restraint.'
