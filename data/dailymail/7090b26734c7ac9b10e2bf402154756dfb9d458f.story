Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's cancerous tumor has shrunk in half thanks to chemotherapy treatments, his brother revealed Tuesday.

Doug Ford said the malignant growth in his abdomen — which doctors had initially said was 4.7 inches by 4.7 inches in size — is now down to 2.4 inches by 2.4 inches.

Mr Ford says his ex-mayor brother will be finishing a fifth round of chemotherapy soon and will also get radiation treatment.

All smiles: Dough Ford said if all goes according to plan, doctors will be able to remove his brother's tumor in the fall

Speaking to reporters at Mount Sinai Hospital, Doug Ford said that his brother will be home for Christmas next week after wrapping up Round 5 of chemotherapy.

He will have 18 days off and then undergo radiation treatment for 25 consecutive days, reported the Toronto Star.

'Rob was signing Christmas cards, he was ecstatic,' Doug Ford said. 'He knows he is in a battle for his life.'

If his condition continues to improve, doctors will perform surgery to remove the tumor from Rob Ford's abdomen in the fall of 2015. 

Doug Ford said: ‘It’s the first positive news we’ve received since Rob’s down there. It’s still a long, long journey but, when you don’t hear positive news for a long time, you grab anything you can. We want to thank everyone for their prayers and wishes.’

Last week, the cancer-stricken former mayor said he was gearing up for the mayoral race in 2018, but the following day he appeared at a City Council meeting looking ill and told colleagues he was feeling 'rough.'

Ford was diagnosed with a rare form of abdominal cancer called liposarcoma in September and dropped his bid for mayoral re-election shortly afterward. Instead, he ran for a seat on the city council and won.

In late November, Rob Ford said his tumor had not shrunk, but had not gotten larger either.

Notorious: Rob Ford's term as mayor was plagued by scandals involving public drinking and crack cocaine use

While the family is happy to now be getting more positive news, Doug Ford said it's too early to celebrate because his brother still has a long journey ahead of him, calling it an 'emotional roller-coaster.'

'He's doing well,' Doug Ford said, adding: 'I'm all smiles.'

Rob Ford's term as mayor was plagued by scandals involving public drinking and crack cocaine use.

After months of denials, Ford in 2013 acknowledged he had smoked crack cocaine in one of his 'drunken stupors,' but he refused to resign. 

The City Council stripped Ford of most of his mayoral powers but lacked the authority to force him out of office because he wasn't convicted of a crime.

Ford's antics made him the target of late-night television comedians in the US. Last March, he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after months of wooing by the talk-show host, who introduced his guest by saying he 'has tripped, bumped, danced, argued and smoked his way into our national consciousness.'
