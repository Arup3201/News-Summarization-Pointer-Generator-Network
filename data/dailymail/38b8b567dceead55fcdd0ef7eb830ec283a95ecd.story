An ancient Chinese paperweight purchased by a widower's late husband for £70 has sold at auction for £170,000.

Made of jade, the highly sought after paperweight was dated as far back as 1368 and created sometime during the Ming Dynasty - a period of China's history from which cultural artifacts now sell for exceptionally high prices.

The owner was a woman from Cheltenham, whose late husband had purchased the three-inch wide item when he taught in Hong Kong five decades ago.

The beautifully crafted Ming Dynasty paperweight, thought to be more than 600 years old, sold for £170,000

The antique depicts a reclining greyish-green horse and was sold along with the original 1962 sale receipt from Hong Kong antique dealer Dunt King.

Robin Fisher, the director of Mallams Auctioneers in Cheltenham, said he did not expect it to sell for such as high price, estimating its value at £30,000 to £40,000. 

He told the Western Daily Press: 'On a good day, I thought it might have sold for around £40,000 but not as much as it did.'

'Over the years, there has been a massive rise in Chinese buyers, especially for art like this piece and that is why we get people who come to us with items which their relatives, who worked abroad, may have brought back with them.'

The sale of the tiny paperweight is just the latest example of a booming demand for Chinese cultural relics.

In April, a 500-year-old wine cup from the Ming Dynasty - described as the 'holy grail' of Chinese art - smashed the world record price for porcelain art.

Liu Yiqian, an 'eccentric' multimillionaire art collector from Shanghai, purchased the white cup at Sotheby's Hong Kong for £20million.

The 500-year-old treasure, which measures 3.1 inches in diameter, is known as a 'chicken cup' due to its decoration of a cockerel and hen tending to their chicks, and is one of only 17 in the world.

The price of art and antiques in China has soared over the last decade as the country experienced an economic boom.

Thanks to a strong sense of national pride, many of the most desired pieces are Chinese in origin, with works by artists still largely unknown internationally selling for millions.

One piece, a painting by Zeng Fanzhi which re-imagines Leonardo Da Vinci's famous 'Last Supper' in an Asian setting, sold for £13million last year - a Chinese modern art record

However, many of the very highest prices are commanded by ancient items such as Ming Dynasty chicken cups and vases.

The previous record for Chinese porcelain was set in 2010 when a Qianlong vase sold for £19.4million.

There has been much talk of Chinese art prices falling following the market slowdown in 2011, but as the sale of the chicken cup today proved, the richest art collectors are still making major purchases.

In fact, Chinese buyers drove Christie's auction house sales up by 14 per cent last year, with the total sale price of £4.27billion a record by any company ever in the art market.
