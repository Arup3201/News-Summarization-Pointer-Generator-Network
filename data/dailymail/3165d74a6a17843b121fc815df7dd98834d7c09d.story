Manny Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles to be met with the accusation that he has 'losing in his mind' ahead of his £160million clash with Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

Pacquiao completed the first part of his training camp in the Philippines before joining up with trainer Freddie Roach at his Wild Card gym.

But Mayweather has taken another swipe at his long-time rival ahead of their £160million mega-fight in Las Vegas on May 2.

Pacquiao had earlier watched his basketball side slump to defeat in the Philippines 

 

'That only thing I know is win, so is losing in the back of his mind? Absolutely! Why? Because he probably lost three or five times before, so losing is in his mind,' he told Fight Hype. 'Losing is not in my mind because the only thing I know how to do is win.'

Pacquiao arrived at LAX on Sunday and was taken away in a Cadillac Escalade as he waved to waiting fans. He had earlier been on the touchline as his basketball side Kia Sorrento lost 115-104 to Blackwater Elite.

Pacquiao lost both controversially and conclusively to Timothy Bradley and Juan Manuel Marquez in 2012 but has won his last three fights.

And Mayweather added: 'When you look at the tale of the tape, I have a longer reach, I'm taller, I'm stronger and I'm more accurate.

'I use a little bit of everything. I use my reach, I use my height, I use my movement; I use different techniques, whereas he's not as versatile as Floyd Mayweather. I think that's the difference between us two.'

Mayweather will begin his training camp on Monday at his gym in Las Vegas.
