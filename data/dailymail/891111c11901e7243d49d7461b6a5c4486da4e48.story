Police investigating the murder of nightclubber Melanie Hall who was brutally murdered 17 years ago, have received new leads after an appeal.

Detectives from Avon and Somerset police have been contacted by members of the public after a BBC Crimewatch appeal aired last night.

It came after police released a photo of a
 white VW Golf GTi hardtop that disappeared from official records 
shortly after Melanie vanished.

Detectives investigating the murder of Melanie Hall believe this car may be linked to the murder

The car - registration C752 CYE - disappeared from official records around the time of Miss Hall's death

Melanie, then 25, disappeared on a night out in Bath, Somerset, in June 1996.

Her remains, dumped beside a slip road on the M5, were not found until 13 years later.

The hospital worker had been battered around the head and her body was wrapped in black bin bags and bound with blue rope.

The vehicle - registration C752 CYE - was last known to be registered on August 7, 1996.

Police say they do not know what happened to it since - and are appealing for anyone with information about it.

They are particularly interested in sightings around the Bath area at the time Melanie disappeared.

They also say the car was linked to the Pentwyn area of Cardiff around the time.

Detective Superintendent Mike Courtiour, leading the inquiry, said: 'We had a reasonable number of calls that are of interest to us and which warrant further investigation.

'We are still keen to reach as many people as possible who may have information about the white VW Golf GTi between April and August 1996, particularly people from the Pentwyn area of Cardiff.'

Last November a 44-year-old man from Bath was arrested and questioned for two days before being released on police bail pending further inquiries.

Detectives also searched a property on an estate in the city.

He was the fourth suspect to be questioned about Miss Hall’s murder since her remains were discovered.

At the time, her father Steve, who lives near Bradford-upon-Avon, Wiltshire, said the development was 'progress'.

He said: 'We are hopeful that progress is being made. It is a long and painful process 17 years down the line.

'This would appear to be connected to the appeal we made at the beginning of October, which is great. We are keeping our minds open on these things.

‘The police are keeping us informed and we are hopeful. It is not the first time someone has been arrested in connection with her death but we are remaining positive.’

Miss Hall, who worked in a hospital, was last seen in June 1996 after apparently arguing with her doctor boyfriend in a nightclub.

Despite a huge police operation, no trace of her was found until 2009 when a workman found parts of her skeleton hidden in plastic bags.

He was clearing undergrowth just a few yards off the northbound slip road at junction 14 of the M5 near Thornbury, Gloucestershire, when he found the remains.

The find was almost 30 miles from where the psychology graduate was last seen in Cadillac’s nightclub.

Five bin-liners contained or covered her remains, including arm and leg bones and her pelvis and skull.

Other parts of her skeleton were found partially buried nearby.

In the four years since Melanie's discovery, her parents and sister Dominique have issued repeated appeals for members of the public to help police with their inquiries.
