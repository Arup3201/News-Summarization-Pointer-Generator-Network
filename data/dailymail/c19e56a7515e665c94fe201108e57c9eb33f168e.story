Celtic could face disciplinary action from UEFA after their fans let off a flare during Thursday’s match against Dinamo Zagreb.

Croatian police then intervened — appearing to spray the away supporters with a liquid — near the start of the Europa League encounter. 

Unconfirmed reports suggest local police used CS spray in order to control fans of the Scottish Premiership outfit.

A bright red flare lit up the away end during the opening stages of the Europa League encounter before the police moved in to try to stop any potential trouble from erupting during the game.

It has been suggested that a policeman, dressed in full riot gear, was seen approaching Celtic supporters.

Ronny Deila's side finished second in their Europa League group after winning just two of their six games.

Kris Commons, Stefan Scepovic and an own goal by Josip Pivaric were not enough for Celtic to claim all three points in Croatia as a Marko Pjaca hat-trick and a goal by Marcelo Brozovic ensured victory for the home side.

Celtic will learn who their next opponents are on Monday. The Scottish giants are unseeded having finished in second spot so could face the likes of Everton, Inter Milan and Napoli.
