The daughter of an oil magnate and his ex-wife who just slammed a court's ruling saying that the $1billion payout she is set to receive in her divorce is 'inappropriate' and 'not fair' was married in a very private and secretive ceremony in the middle of her parents contentious trial.

Jane Hamm, whose mother Sue Ann Arnall just received the second highest divorce settlement in United States history from her husband, and Jane's father, Harold Hamm, wed Thomas Lerum at the Grand Del Mar resort and hotel in San Diego, California.

And shockingly, the ceremony happened on October 4, as Miss Arnall and Mr. Hamm were in the middle of their 10 week trial over her divorce settlement.

They do: Jane Hamm tied the knot with Thomas Lerum in the middle of a highly contentious divorce trial between her parents Harold Hamm and Sue Ann Arnall

Private affair: The ceremony took place on October 4 and was very hush hush, with no coverage and few photos, such as this one of the two sharing their first dance

Appealing: Miss Arnall has filed an appeal less than a month after she was awarded $1billion in her divorce from ex-husband, saying she is worth much more

The  event was so hush hush that photos are few and far between and there was never any media or society coverage of the nuptials.

It is uncertain if both Mr. Hamm and Miss Arnall attended their daughter's wedding, though mother and daughter were in conversation on Twitter in the days following as Miss Arnall checked in with her daughter following the wedding, making it appear that the mother of the bride was in attendance for the big day. 

The attractive, young newlyweds, who got engaged in November 2013, live in California where Jane works for the Republican Party of Los Angeles County according to her Facebook.

They honeymooned at the pricey and private Rosewood Mayakoba resort in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.

Miss Arnall and Mr. Hamm also have a second daughter, Hilary, who attends Dartmouth College.

Miss Arnall has appealed the ruling made last month in an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma courtroom, citing 78 alleged errors and missteps that caused a judge to grossly undervalue her stake in one of America's greatest oil fortunes.

The oil fortune she refers to is that of Continental Resources, the company founded by her ex-husband Harold Hamm in 1967, who himself is worth $9billion.

The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. 

Pay up: Mr. Hamm and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup, meaning she is entitled to half the assets earned during their marriage

Real estate portfolio: Miss Arnall also picked up three properties in the divorce, including this home in Enid, Oklahoma

This as Miss Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with the couple's two of their Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling.

Mr. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma.  

As for the appeal, Miss Arnall made it clear just days after the November 10 ruling that officially made her a billionaire that she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued.

The only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the United States was Jocelyn Wildenstein, who reportedly received $2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband Alec in 1999.

Relaxed living: The Enid home has been valued at $800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in Oklahoma

All good?: Miss Arnell's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce

Miss Arnell stated that she felt that the decision by Judge Howard Haralson to allow lawyers for both her husband and for Continental Resources to be involved in the proceedings was 'inappropriate' in that it allowed them to 'double team' her.

The crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and Mr. Hamm made beginning in 1988, the year he and Miss Arnall were married.

During the trial it was argued that Continental’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors, such as rising oil prices, and, under Oklahoma law, only the 'active' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division.

Miss Arnall’s lawyers contend however that Judge Haralson miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $14billion rise in the value of Mr. Hamm's Continental shares during the marriage - 6 percent.

'As Sue Ann has stated previously, 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage, and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal,' her legal team said in a statement. 

The Mansion: Miss Arnell also got the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million

Big growth: During the course of their marriage, Mr. Hamm's company's worth jumped from $50million to $20billion

Miss Arnall, who worked as a lawyer for Continental when she and Mr. Hamm married, and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company, also claims that Judge Haralson undervalued her own contributions to the couple’s wealth.

Most estimates have stated that Continental Resources was worth around $50million in 1988 when the couple married, which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $20billion behemoth it is today. 

A behemoth that Mr. Hamm has a 68 percent stake in, a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be 'separate property.' 

All this, combined with lingering timeline questions presented by Miss Arnall that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple's 1988 wedding, will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years.

And there's somehow more.

That aforementioned $9billion fortune of Mr. Hamm's was in fact a $20billion fortune as recently as August, with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil.

Started from the bottom: Mr. Hamm was born one of 13 children to a sharecropper 

Working his way up:  He pumped gas when he was 20 and slowly saved up his money to drill his first well

Filing for divorce in March 2013, Miss Arnall alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair, citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage.

Mr. Hamm had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world, a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the American dream.

Born one of 13 children to a sharecropper, Mr. Hamm worked his way up, picking cotton as a child, pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well.

And while Mr. Hamm, who was previously married and has three children from that union, is no fan of the spotlight, he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years.

In 2012, Mr. Hamm became a big part of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser, a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future.

Mr. Hamm also hosted a fundraiser at his $4.6 million Nichols Hills, Oklahoma mansion for the Republican candidate, which raised more than $2million.

It is worth noting that the Nichols Hill mansion is no longer Mr. Hamm's but, along with a $800,000 home in Enid, Oklahoma, the property of Miss Arnall.

Big score: In 2012, Mr. Hamm was one of the select few named to the Time 100, an event he attended with his wife

Friends in high places: 2012 was also the year Mr. Hamm became an adviser for the Romney campaign 

It was also in early 2012 that Mr. Hamm earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was named to the Time 100 for that year.

He and his wife attended the ceremony together that April in New York that also honored, among others, Marco Rubio, Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Rihanna.

The two posed on the red carpet together, smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another, looking happy and excited. 

Miss Arnall would file for divorce less than a year later.
