'Rich man's toy': Philip Hammond, the Transport Secretary, admitted only the wealthy can afford rail travel

Rocketing fares mean that the railways have become a ‘rich man’s toy’, Transport Secretary Philip Hammond admitted yesterday.

He acknowledged that inflation-busting
ticket increases meant that customers who travel by rail have 
‘significantly higher incomes’ than the general population.

He added that some fares on the West 
Coast Mainline had become ‘eye-wateringly’ expensive and that the 
planned new high speed link would probably be out of reach to ‘factory 
workers’.

His comments to MPs on the Transport 
Select Committee will enrage commuters because the increase is blamed on
the Government’s decision to reduce the costs to the public purse of 
running the rail network.

'Uncomfortable fact number one is that
the railway is already relatively a rich man's toy,' Mr Hammond told 
the Commons Transport Committee.

'People who use the railway on average have significantly higher incomes than the population as a whole - simple fact.'

The minister described ticket prices on the West Coast Mainline as ranging from 'eye-wateringly expensive to really quite reasonable if you dig around and use the advance purchasing ticket options that are available'.

But he insisted that even those who are too poor to enjoy rail travel would still benefit from projects like the planned HS2 high speed rail link between London and northern England - because their bosses will be able to get around easier.

'If you are working in a factory in Manchester you might never get on HS2 but you would certainly be benefiting from it if the sales director from your company is routinely hopping on it to jet round the world from Heathrow in a way that brings in orders that keep you employed,' he said. 

'Eye-wateringly expensive': Mr Hammond said it was a 'simple fact' that people who travel by rail on services like the West Coast Mainline earn more than most

Commuters reacted with horror last 
month when the government announced it was changing the formula for 
calculating fare increases from the rate of inflation according to the 
Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 1 per cent to RPI plus 3 per cent.

With
July's RPI remaining unchanged at 5 per cent, it means season ticket 
holders face a hike in fares of an average 8 per cent in the new year.

Worse
still, the 8 per cent rise can be taken by train companies as an 
average, meaning passengers could face even higher increases in their 
commuting costs.

At the time, Mr Hammond said raising fares was 'a difficult decision' but extra money was needed to guarantee improvements to ensure railways were better value for money in future.

That would allow us 'to put the era of above inflation rises in regulated fares behind us', he added.

But shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said the Government was 'totally out of touch with the cost of living crisis facing commuters' and failed to understand how 'eye-watering rail fare rises' would add to the burden on families.

David Sidebottom, director of rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said regulating some fares was in passengers' interests but allowing train companies to set fares on individual routes was 'deeply unfair'.

Transport workers union the RMT even warned that the price rises could cost the Tories key marginal seats as passengers voiced their anger at the ballot box.

Economic benefits: Mr Hammond said the extra investment higher fares could bring would help executives do business more easily

Responding to Mr Hammond's comments, Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport said: 'Philip Hammond's description of rail fares as "eye-watering" must lead the minister to reconsider the steep fare rises currently planned by Government.

'Far from being simply "a rich man's toy" trains are also vital for many of those on more moderate incomes who need to get to work, and the Government will price many off the railways if it carries on with its plan to increases rail fares at three per cent above inflation over the next few years.

'Instead, the Transport Secretary's promised fare review must deliver simpler, fairer and affordable rail fares.'
