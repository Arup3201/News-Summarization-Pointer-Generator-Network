Alberto Contador will end his career with Tinkoff-Saxo in 2016, the multiple grand tour winner has announced.

The Spanish rider has committed to the squad for his final season before retiring at the end of 2016.

Contador wrote on Twitter: 'Hello all, happy to announce that in 2016 will continue being rider of @tinkoff-saxo'.

Multiple Grand Tour winner Alberto Contador has announced he will end his career with Tinkoff-Saxo in 2016

The 32-year-old Spaniard is one of just six riders to have won all three Grand Tours

Tinkoff-Saxo team boss Oleg Tinkov said on Twitter: 'Best stays with the best'. 

Contador is among the favourites for the 2015 Tour de France, which begins on July 4 in Utrecht.

The 32-year-old is one of six riders to have won all three grand tours - of France, Italy and Spain.

In 2014 Contador crashed out of the Tour de France, but responded by winning the Vuelta a Espana.

Contador won the 2007 and 2009 Tours de France - he was stripped of the 2010 title for an anti-doping infringement - the 2008 Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta in 2008, 2012 and 2014.

Tinkov said in a media release: 'I'm very happy that Alberto will lead Tinkoff-Saxo in 2016 as well, because I truly believe he is the best cyclist in the world and I am convinced he will continue to be so for a few more years.

'Unfortunately, he decided he would retire at the end of next year which means he will race with my team for two full seasons. I would have, obviously, preferred him to stay longer but that was his personal decision.

'However, I am very proud that Alberto's impressive career will conclude in my team and I hope he takes the Tinkoff-Saxo colours to the top step of the Tour de France podium in 2015 and 2016.'

Contador added: 'I am very happy to have closed the deal. It is already five years that I have been working with (team manager) Bjarne Riis and the possibility to continue for another year is satisfying.'
