Jay Z and Solange Knowles’ lift incident isn’t the first time celebrities or VIPs have caused havoc in a luxury hotel (nor will it be the last).

From
 Michael Jackson dangling Blanket from the Adlon in Berlin, to the 
Chateau Marmont in LA banning Lindsay Lohan after she failed to pay her 
$46,000 bill, getting into trouble with hotels is par for the course for A-listers .

As Jay Z, Beyonce and Solange kiss and make up, Travelzoo has compiled a list of the top 10 most scandalous hotels in the world.

The aftermath: Jay Z looked shellshocked as the trio left the elevator after the fight at the Standard Hotel in New York, which scoops first place on the Travelzoo list of scandalous hotels, on May 5

Number one: The Standard Hotel in New York City has been ranked the most scandalous hotel in the world

With
 the Standard hotel in New York City scooping the top slot for the Met Ball 
elevator ‘fight’ this month, the travel deals website names Prince Harry’s Las 
Vegas antics in second place. 

The
 fourth in line to the throne partied at the five-star Wynn in 2012, 
getting snapped stripping off in a game of ‘naked billiards’.

Holiday
 Inn Flint, in Michigan, is in third place, where Keith Moon, drummer of
 The Who, managed to blow-up a toilet, reverse a car into the swimming 
pool and smash his front tooth out whilst slipping in birthday cake on 
his 21st in 1967.

The
 event, which coincided with the band’s first tour of America, resulted 
in a lifetime global ban to the country, which was actually lifted in 
1999, for The Who.

The
 Adlon Hotel in Berlin is named in fourth place, thanks to the former 
King of Pop Michael Jackson dangling baby Blanket out of the window of 
his fifth-floor room in 2002.

He
 apologised afterward saying: ‘I offer no excuses for what happened, I 
got caught up in the excitement of the moment. I would never 
intentionally endanger the lives of my children.’

While
 the Beverly Hilton, in Beverly Hills, makes up the top five. The 
five-star venue, where the Golden Globes are held annually, is 
reportedly where US president John F Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe would 
enjoy romantic liaisons. 

It’s
 also where Angelina Jolie jumped in the pool in her ball gown after 
promising to do so if she won an award for her performance in GIA.

Angela Dow, chief curator of hotels at Travelzoo, said: ‘Following the recent leaked footage from the family argument involving Jay Z and his sister-in-law, Travelzoo has come up with a list of nine more properties where celebrities have behaved in a way perhaps they wish they hadn’t.’

In
 sixth place, Travelzoo ranks Hotel Sofitel Cardales in Buenos Aires, 
where a half-naked Harry Styles and Niall Horan were filmed on CCTV 
jumping down a corridor in May.

And
 the Mohegan Sun Resort & Casino in Connecticut, where Britney 
Spears’ children allegedly trashed their room causing $20,000 of damage 
in 2009, comes seventh.

They reportedly drew on the walls with crayons and even went to the toilet in the hotel pool.

He was arrested and charged, being led from the property in handcuffs on 7 June 2005, describing the situation as: ‘Possibly the most shameful situation that I've ever gotten myself in... and I've done some pretty dumb things in my life.’
