Victim: Pc Keith Blakelock was murdered after he was ambushed by an armed mob yelling 'kill the pig', a court heard today

Constable Keith Blakelock was stabbed more than 40 times and almost decapitated by a mob screaming ‘kill the pig’ during the 1985 Tottenham riots, a court heard yesterday.

The police officer was beaten and stabbed ‘without mercy’ by up to 20 rioters as he lay helpless on the floor, it was said.

Details of the ‘ferocious’ murder – in which a knife was left embedded in his neck – emerged on the first day of PC Blakelock’s murder trial yesterday.

Nicholas Jacobs, 45, is accused of murdering the policeman during the riots 29 years ago when he was 16.

The Old Bailey heard that the 1985  riots had a ‘more sinister edge’ than  those of 2011 because some rioters ‘appeared to have as their target the death of a police officer’.

The riots broke out a day after the death of Cynthia Jarrett, who suffered a heart attack when officers searched her home looking for evidence against her son.

PC Blakelock was in a group of 11 officers who were attacked on the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham, North London, on October 6, 1985.

They were attempting to protect firemen who were trying to put out fires when an armed mob surrounded them.

Fearing they were about to become trapped by a much larger group of thugs, the officers and firefighters ran for safety. As they fled, PC Blakelock and PC Richard Coombes fell and were immediately attacked by rioters shouting: ‘Kill the pig.’

Allegations: Richard Whittam QC (right) told the Old Bailey Nicholas 
Jacobs (centre) was armed and part of an armed mob which stabbed Pc Blakelock to death

Family: Elizabeth Johnson was accompanied to the Old Bailey by sons Lee, Kevin and Mark Blakelock (left to right)

Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said PC 
Coombes suffered serious injuries and ‘was very fortunate to survive’. 
He added: ‘PC Blakelock did not. The attack on him was without mercy.

‘He was beaten and stabbed to death before his colleagues were able to force the attackers away.

‘PC
 Blakelock suffered something in excess of 40 stab type injuries and 
there appears to have been an attempt made to decapitate him.

‘The attack left him with a knife embedded in his neck.

‘That was recovered from his body at the post-mortem examination.

‘He had many cuts to his arms and caused by bladed weapons as he tried to defend himself from the mob.’

Mr Whittam said Jacobs, known as  Nicky, was part of an ‘inner circle’ of  up to 20 rioters who kicked and stabbed PC Blakelock.

He said that Jacobs ‘was armed with a bladed weapon and he used it as part of the joint attack’.

Support: Protesters outside the Old Bailey, as Nicholas Jacobs stands trial today for murder during the Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham in October 1985

Denial: Last year Nicholas Jacobs was pictured with a sign denying the murder of the police officer in 1985

‘There is no dispute that PC Blakelock was murdered,’ Mr Whittam said.

‘There is no dispute that Nicky Jacobs was involved in the public disorder that night, as were some of the witnesses.

‘Nicky
 Jacobs is the sole person on trial. He is on trial for the murder of PC
 Blakelock.’ The officer’s widow Elizabeth Johnson and their sons Lee, 
Kevin and Mark sat stoically in court as details of the murder emerged.

The 1985 Tottenham riots erupted the day after a man was arrested in connection with a suspected stolen vehicle tax disc.

When
 officers searched the man’s home address, his mother, Mrs Jarrett, died
 from a heart attack, ‘fuelling further the existing community 
tensions’. ‘Many members of the local community believed that the police
 were responsible for the death,’ Mr Whittam told the jury.

Aftermath: Police watch the devastation following the riots in Tottenham, North London where a mob stabbed PC Blakelock to death on Broadwater Farm estate

Disorder: Police on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, north London, during the riots in which Pc Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death

Tributes: Police officers inspect floral tributes left for PC Blakelock close to where he was killed

Funeral: PC Keith Blakelock's coffin, draped in the blue Metropolitan Police flag, is carried by six policemen into St James' Church, Muswell Hill, north London

‘The
 anger and grief of the family and friends of Mrs Jarrett spread to 
other members of the community and a demonstration was planned to take 
place outside Tottenham police station on Sunday, October 6.’

About 300 people were convicted of public order offences after the riot, jurors were told.

Mr
 Whittam told the jury of seven men and five women that there had been 
two investigations into the murder before the current one. The first 
inquiry in 1985 resulted in three juveniles and three adults being 
charged for murder. The case against the juveniles was dropped and all 
three adults were convicted on March 1987.

Their
 convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991 after doubts 
over the authenticity of notes taken during police interviews emerged. 
Two detectives were prosecuted over failings in the investigation, but 
they were acquitted at the Old Bailey.

Jacobs, of Hackney, East London, denies murder.

The trial continues.
