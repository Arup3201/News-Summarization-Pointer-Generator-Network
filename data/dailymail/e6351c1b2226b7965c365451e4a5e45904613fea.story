He may have been allowed to leave the club without ever playing a league game for the first team, but Kristoffer Olsson still showed Arsenal some love as he departed.

The 19-year-old Swede, whose only first-team appearance for the Gunners came off the bench in the Capital One Cup last season, has joined FC Midtjylland this week on a permanent deal.

But, as the news was announced, Olsson took to Twitter to say 'Once a Gunner, always a Gunner'.

The tweet reflects Cesc Fabregas' comments when he left the club to join Barcelona, although the Spanish midfielder has sinced joined rivals Chelsea, after Arsene Wenger opted not to buy him back.

Olsson has been on loan at FC Midtjylland since the beginning of the season, playing six times in the Danish top flight.

The Sweden U21 international said on joining permanently: 'this is a club that believes in me and sees my potential.'
