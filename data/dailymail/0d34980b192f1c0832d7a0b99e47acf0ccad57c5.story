Plans for secret courts to be voted on by MPs today will undermine centuries of open justice and erode Britain’s moral standing in the world, according to a hard-hitting new report.

A paper by senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie - a campaigner on human rights - and leading QC Anthony Peto, calls on the government to rewrite its plans to hold court cases covering national security behind closed doors.

Cabinet Minister Ken Clarke has watered down the controversial Justice and Security Bill following a series of humiliating defeats in the House of Lords.

But ministers are still facing a rebellion despite attempts to buy off Liberal Democrat MPs opposed to secret justice.

And today Mr Tyrie publishes a report for the Centre for Policy Studies think tank branding the plans ‘neither just nor secure’ and arguing that they need to be ‘substantially rewritten’.

He said plans to hold civil court hearings on whether British spies colluded in torture will lead to a cover up of the dark side of the war on terror.

‘The Government must make major changes to the Justice and Security Bill or risk prejudicing both Britain’s system of open justice and our moral standing in the world,’ the report says.

The Daily Mail has led criticism of plans to allow secret courts, under which civil cases would be conducted entirely in private.

Ministers claim they need to hold some cases behind closed doors so that judges can hear evidence on intelligence matters.

The Government has paid millions of pounds to terror suspects who accuse it of complicity in torture and rendition, after ministers said it was impossible to defend such claims without releasing secret material.

But under the plans for ‘closed material proceedings’ defendants or claimants will not allowed to be present, know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security-cleared advocate, rather than their own lawyer.

The new report says: ‘That Britain allowed itself to be dragged into complicity in extraordinary rendition - the kidnap and torture of individuals as a matter of policy - is a disgrace.

'That, nearly a decade later, the extent and limits of Britain’s involvement are still unknown is almost as shocking.

‘Far from bolstering that confidence, the Justice and Security Bill... would weaken it.

'The effect of the Government’s proposals would make it more difficult to establish the truth about Britain’s complicity in kidnap and torture. The Bill would provide a route neither more just nor more secure.’

The report calls for new rules which would mean summaries of the national security sensitive information be provided to the excluded party and his or her legal representatives.

It demands a five year sunset clause, which would force Parliament to reconsider how the secret courts are operating in the next Parliament.

The report warns that MPs must also stand firm to oppose the removal of the courts’ power to hear applications which seek the disclosure of information held by UK authorities, in cases deemed to be “sensitive”.

This was the principle used by detainee Binyam Mohamed’s lawyers when he was contesting charges that could have resulted in the death penalty.

‘Removing it will make it harder to uncover official wrongdoing in matters such as extraordinary rendition,’ the report argues.

And Mr Tyrie also argues that Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee be given far more powers to hold the security services to account.

At present it reports to the Prime Minister and was widely derided for failing to get to grips with MI5 and MI6’s knowledge of rendition.

He said: ‘The title of the Bill is classic doublespeak; it brings us neither more justice nor greater security.

To agree only to the amendments suggested by the Lords is not going far enough, as the Lords simply did not have the time to put all their concerns over this Bill in the form of amendments.’

A government source said Mr Clarke had bowed to concerns raised by the Lords and by Parliament’s Joint Human Rights Committee (JCHR).

The source said: ‘The Bill is being substantially rewritten to accommodate the Lib Dems and clauses have been rewritten to achieve what the JCHR wanted.’
