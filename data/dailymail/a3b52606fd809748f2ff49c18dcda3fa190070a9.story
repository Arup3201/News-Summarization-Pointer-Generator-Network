A mother of three severely disabled young children is suspected of smothering them to death.

Tania Clarence, 42, was last night described as a devoted mother who ‘doted on her children’.

She was arrested after police discovered the lifeless bodies of three-year-olds Ben and Max and four-year-old Olivia at the family’s £2million home in south-west London.

Friends said all three children 
suffered the degenerative condition spinal muscular atrophy – sometimes 
described as ‘floppy baby syndrome’ – and received specialist care 
around the clock.

Their 
father, investment banker Gary Clarence, 43, had travelled to the 
couple’s native South Africa with their eldest daughter Taya – who was 
not disabled – to celebrate her eighth birthday.

Last
 night Mr Clarence was flying back from Johannesburg but Mr Clarence’s 
brother Kevin said the family were too upset to discuss the deaths.

Mr
 Clarence, a trained lawyer, studied at Stellenbosch University and in 
Holland before joining Investec in 1999, two years after the couple 
married in South Africa.

He began working in its financial department, before moving to the US for 18 months and eventually becoming a director, responsible for international healthcare clients.

Spinal
 muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease sometimes called ‘floppy baby 
syndrome’ that affects between 5,500 and 6,000 people in the UK.

It
 causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement as the nerve 
cells connecting the brain and spinal cord to the body’s muscles break 
down over time.

Muscles
 used for activities such as crawling, walking, sitting up and moving 
the head become gradually weaker, but mental abilities remain 
unaffected.

In the 
most severe forms of SMA, types I and II, fatal respiratory problems 
often develop early on and it is the leading cause of genetic death in 
infants and toddlers.

Depending
 on its severity, children may need surgery, exercises and  equipment to
 improve mobility and breathing. There is no cure.

SMA is caused by a faulty copy of a gene, which is activated when both parents carry it.

Around
 one in every 40 to 60 people carry the gene. It can be tested for 
during pregnancy, although the test can increase the risk of a 
miscarriage.

Joanna 
Mitchell, from the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Trust, said: ‘There can be 
terrible pain and it can be challenging for parents to look after 
children with the condition.’

The couple had Taya in 2006. But while pregnant with the twins Mrs Clarence discovered that their second daughter Olivia had a degenerative genetic illness.

The twins, who were born prematurely in Lisbon in 2010, were soon discovered to have inherited the same illness.

All
 three children were left with severely limited development and doctors 
warned that Olivia was unlikely to survive to her teens.

The
 couple threw everything into providing for their children. Mrs 
Clarence, a talented graphic designer, gave up her career to look after 
them and the family renovated a seven-bedroom home in the commuter belt 
in New Malden.

They moved in
 last year after builders gutted the home and installed special 
features, including a lift and ramps, during a nine-month project.

The couple also employed a nanny and carers were regularly seen  visiting the children at all hours of day and night.

New
 Malden councillor Ken Smith said Mrs Clarence had contacted him 
recently with concerns about an uneven pavement that was hindering her 
children’s wheelchairs.

He 
added: ‘She absolutely doted on the children. When I spoke to the lady 
she was very, very concerned about the children and that they were 
looked after properly. This is a tragedy.’

All
 three disabled children attended Bedelsford School, a highly respected 
school for the disabled in Kingston, where staff said they were ‘deeply 
saddened’ by the deaths.

Police discovered the bodies after they were 
called to the couple’s three-storey Victorian mansion on Tuesday 
evening.

Family friends had dialled 999 after becoming concerned when they couldn’t contact the family for more than 24 hours.

Gary and Tania Clarence spent almost a year renovating their £2million home to make it suitable for their disabled children before moving in.

The couple bought the house in 2011 for £1,060,000 but it was derelict and needed extensive renovation.

They shelled out hundreds of thousands of pounds on the seven-bedroom property in New Malden, Surrey, stripping it back and rebuilding it almost from bare foundations.

When it was finished it included a state-of-the-art lift for their second daughter, Olivia.

The couple spent another £50,000 on a new driveway, removing a tree and fitting a sloping entrance to the front door that could be used by wheelchairs.

The property also boasted a 140ft south-facing garden for the children to play in and the fridge in the kitchen included a holder for wine glasses.

Neighbour June Dodd said they spent ‘months and months’ doing it up before moving in from their previous home in nearby Wimbledon, South London.

Ethel Winstanley, who lives opposite the couple, said she congratulated them on the house’s ‘transformation’ last summer.

The
 three children were found dead in their upstairs bedrooms. Police 
suspect they may have been suffocated.

Mrs Clarence was taken to St 
George’s Hospital, Tooting, south London, and arrested on suspicion of 
murder after treatment to minor wounds.

She remained in police custody last night.

Neighbours
 said two tearful women were standing in the street as police and 
ambulances arrived. Both were so upset they could barely speak.

Michele 
Bacchus, 38, who helped them, said: ‘They were sobbing and very upset. I
 don’t know if it was them that found the family. It was awful.’

Last night a family friend said: ‘She had to cope with so much, she was a very loving mother.’

Shocked neighbours said it was a tragedy and called the family ‘really, really lovely people’.

Retired
 nurse Joy Devis, 86, said the deaths came as a ‘huge surprise and 
shock’ and other neighbours said they had last seen the children playing
 in the front garden on  Sunday ‘larking about’.

They
 and other well-wishers created a poignant makeshift memorial to the 
children outside the house yesterday, leaving teddy bears, bouquets of 
flowers, pot plants and a child’s skipping rope in the driveway – which 
was guarded by police officers.

A
 Metropolitan Police spokesman said post-mortem examinations, undertaken
 by a specialist paediatric pathologist, are likely to take place today.
