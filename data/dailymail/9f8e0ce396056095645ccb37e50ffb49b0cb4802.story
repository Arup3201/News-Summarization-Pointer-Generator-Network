Police in Ohio say an 18-year-old man killed himself while playing Russian roulette.

The Columbus Dispatch reports that Rashaun McCrae died on Monday night, and it took Whitehall police several days to confirm his cause of death and investigate the accounts of friends in the house at the time.

Police reports say an 18-year-old friend told officers that McCrae was sitting in a kitchen spinning the cylinder of a revolver and asked him if he wanted to play Russian roulette.

Ohio teen: Rashaun McCrae, 18,  of Ohio died in a game of Russian roulette on 141 Beechford Road in Whitehall, Ohio on Monday 

The friend declined, left the room and heard a gunshot.

A 23-year-old woman told police that McCrae showed her and a friend the gun, loaded it with one bullet, held it to his head and fired.

'He showed them it was loaded with one round and spun the cylinder three times,' the police report states.

'He said something to the effect of, "Have you ever played Russian roulette?” held the revolver to his head and fired.'

One 911 caller said she heard shouts of 'Why would you do this?'

A second 911 caller told police he saw the teen carry the gun upstairs. 

As defined by the Merriam Webster dictionary Russian roulette is,'  a dangerous game in which people fire a gun with a single bullet at their heads without knowing if the bullet will be shot or not.'
