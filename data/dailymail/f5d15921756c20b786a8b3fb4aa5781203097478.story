Former Conservative communications chief Andy Coulson is still being held in a high-security prison alongside terrorists and murderers - despite a judge recommending that he be sent to an open prison.

The 46-year-old ex-News of the World editor was sent to the notorious maximum-security Belmarsh prison in south east London after being convicted of conspiracy to hack phones on July 4.

His lawyers had been expecting him to be moved to an open prison.

But six weeks later Mr Coulson, who was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones, has still not been categorised, meaning he is not yet eligible for a move.

At a costs hearing last month, Mr Justice Saunders, who presided over the phone hacking trial, expressed concern that Mr Coulson remained in Belmarsh, a category A prison holding high-risk prisoners.

He offered to write to the prison governor, Phil Wragg, more than a fortnight ago. 

However, despite having done this, it emerged last night that the authorities still haven’t completed the paperwork for Mr Coulson’s move to another establishment.

By comparison, disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris, who was found guilty of a series of child sex offences, has already been downgraded to the Bullingdon Category C jail in Oxfordshire – despite being sentenced on the same day as Mr Coulson.

Mr Couslon, a father-of-three, is being held alongside a number of Islamic terrorists and convicted killers.

Neville Thurlbeck, the News of the World’s former chief reporter who was also jailed in Belmarsh for phone-hacking, wrote this week on a blog that ‘despite being left in a Category A prison, Andy Coulson is in good spirits and is getting on well with his fellow inmates’.

He added: ‘Reports that he has been attacked are totally untrue. 

'We have been in each other’s company for between 22 to 24 hours per day and I have witnessed nothing other than the hand of friendship to both of us. We would like to put the record straight on this.’

It is believed that if and when Mr Coulson is transferred, it would be to Standford Hill open prison in Kent, near his home.
