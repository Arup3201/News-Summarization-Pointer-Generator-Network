Fenway Sports Group will underwrite the redevelopment of Anfield with an interest free £114million loan.

Liverpool have confirmed that work will finally begin on Monday to increase the capacity of their stadium to 53,500, with the Main Stand being remodelled and an extra 8,500 seats being added.

The project, which has been two years in the planning, will be completed for the start of 2016-17 season.

Repayments to FSG – who took control of Liverpool in October 2010 after the doomed Tom Hicks-George Gillet reign – will be made from the extra £20m a year revenue the extra seating will bring, over a five-and-a-half year period.

The Main Stand will have two new tiers added to take the capacity to over 53,000 by the start of the 2016-17 season

45,522 - Anfield's current capacity

58,800 - Anfield's potential new capacity

8,500 - Phase one to extend the Main Stand

4,500 - Phase two to extend Anfield Road end 

£75m - cost of extension by 2016/17 season 

£260m - cost of overall regeneration in Anfield

The estimated cost of the build is £75m with £39m going on costs.

Steven Gerrard told Liverpool's official website: 'It's very exciting news that we have finally got around to extending Anfield. For me, it was all about staying at Anfield. As much as I like new stadiums, I'm more traditional and I like the old stadiums like the Camp Nou and places like this, where all the history and all the memories happen.

'There have been so many unbelievable nights and memories here, it would have been a shame to leave it all and for this to have become houses or apartments. 

'Now that they are going to extend the stadium, it's going to become even bigger, better and noisier. Hopefully there are many more fantastic memories to come.'

There are no plans to sell naming rights for Anfield but the new stand could be sponsored, with Liverpool having held initial talks with interested parties about a potential £10million agreement, which would work out roughly at £1million per season.

The redevelopment of Anfield has been an enormous issue for Liverpool since the turn of this century, with Hicks and Gillett famously declaring when they bought the club from David Moores in February 2007 that they would 'have a spade in the ground' within 60 days.

They had intended to build on a site on adjacent Stanley Park but their plans were doomed to failure, which is why this announcement is regarded by Chairman Tom Werner and Ian Ayre, the club’s managing director, as being a 'momentous day' in Liverpool’s history.

Anfield is soon to be altered after Liverpool won permission from the city council in September

Liverpool's new Main Stand will be made up of three tiers and will include premium seating for Reds fans

1. 75,731 - Old Trafford, Manchester United

2. 60,362 - Emirates Stadium, Arsenal

3. 52,405 - St James' Park, Newcastle United

4. 48,707 - Stadium of Light, Sunderland 

5. 46,708 - Etihad Stadium, Manchester City

6. 45,522 - Anfield, Liverpool  

‘It was just over two years ago that we said our preference was to stay at Anfield and here we are today announcing that the expansion is going ahead,’ said Werner. ‘We have made more progress in the last two years than in the last decade.’

FSG had considered building a complete new ground but, having explored a number of possibilities, they have favoured pursuing a project on the lines of how they redeveloped Fenway Park, the home of the Boston Red Sox baseball team.

Werner added: ‘Having experience of expanding Fenway Park and being through a similar and very successful project of the Red Sox, everyone at FSG is extremely proud and excited to be part of the expanding of Anfield.’

Carillion are the construction company that has been entrusted with the task of building the Main Stand and Liverpool also have planning permission to redevelop the Anfield Road stand – which would add another 4,500 seats – in the future. But, as yet, there is no urgency to pursue that.

‘The football club for many years has been looking for a solution and although it has been a long time coming, under this ownership it has actually been a quick process,’ said Ayre. ‘We spent the first 18 months looking at a variety of solutions and decided staying at Anfield was the best.

‘It has taken two years to get where we are today where we have certainty. What we always said is we did not want to create any false dawns. Finding the right economic solution in the best interests of the club.’

A significant chunk of the new seats will go to corporate clients but, at a time when Liverpool supporters have been protesting about the cost of admission prices, Ayre has argued it is a necessity to supplement incomes if Liverpool are to keep pace with their Premier League rivals.

‘If you use the word “affordability” – I don’t think there’s a football club in the country who could afford to spend money on a new stand without the assistance of corporate hospitality,’ said Ayre. ‘It pays. It will probably pay two thirds or more of the payback of this facility and that is a fact of life.

‘You can’t find economic solutions that work in big new stadiums that don’t have corporate. We will still be some way behind the corporate hospitality numbers they have at old Trafford and probably around the same sort of level they do at Arsenal. It feels right for the model we have created.’

When asked about his favourite Anfield memory, Gerrard said: 'I think personally, it would have to be the Olympiacos game or even the Chelsea victory with the so-called "ghost goal". 

'From the outside, I think it would be difficult to pick one other memory because there's been so many from so many fantastic players and so many great sides. It's difficult to pick one. From my own point of view, it would probably be Olympiacos.'
