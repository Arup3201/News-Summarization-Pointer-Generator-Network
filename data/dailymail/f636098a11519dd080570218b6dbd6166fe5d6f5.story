A physician and national expert on the world of zombie neuroscience sparked fury among listeners of a radio show when he pretended that a zombie invasion was really happening – and people believed him.

Dr Steven Schlozman, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Lecturer in Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, was interviewed on the radio show, Coast to Coast, hosted by Ian Punnett.

Schlozman was on the show in 2011 to talk about his book, The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks From the Apocalypse, which was released that year.

Zombie 'scientist': Steven Schlozman spoke about his book, The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks From the Apocalypse, on a radio show as though it were based on true events

Fun and games: The host of Coast to Coast, Ian Punnett, left, is known for his radio show's format in which interviewees pretend they are talking about real-life events when speaking about their science fiction novels. He interviewed Schlozman about his 2011 book, The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks from the Apocalypse

In an article he wrote on Sunday for the New York Times, the physician and author writes about the experience and why he thinks people believe in hoaxes.

The radio programme is known for its format, in which Punnett takes a creepy work of outlandish fiction and interviews the author as if what he’d written were actually true.

Schlozman wasn’t even the first zombie author to be featured: Max Brooks discussed his novel World War Z with Punnett in much the same format. 

According to Schlozman, the Coast to Coast broadcasts are entertaining and not a little unsettling; the late-night venue probably adds to the verisimilitude.

'Everything is just that much easier to believe when you’re listening alone in the dark,' says Schlozman.

On the show Punnett asked him to help make sense of a new and 'terrifying threat' to our planet.

So, Schlozman told him about a 'newly-uncovered disease' that he had learned about from a manuscript penned by a doctor from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had succumbed to a zombie plague while studying its origins.

The disease was called Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency syndrome (A.N.S.D.), Schlozman explained on air, saying that it might have been engineered by nefarious hedge-fund managers, in hopes that the stock market would plunge and become vulnerable to manipulations as the chaos spread.

Schlozman says in the New York Times that he thought listeners knew he was messing with them.

Instead, the show generated a ripple of genuine concern.

Emails showed up in his inbox, and he got questions along the lines of: ‘What’s the best medicine to stave off the zombie infection?’ and ‘How do I keep my house safe from the zombie onslaught?’.

‘Some people who contacted me — and realised that we were fooling around — were furious that I had even toyed with such an idea in a public venue. One person went so far as to suggest that I had violated my Hippocratic oath,’ said Scholzman in piece he wrote for the New York Times.

According to the physician, he felt surprised by the reactions.

‘I was, after all, talking about an exceedingly well known, undeniably frightening but nevertheless entirely fictional pop-culture phenomenon. I didn’t really expect anyone to take me seriously.’

What happened to Schlozman also happened to another, very well-known science fiction author, Orson Welles.

On October 30, 1938, Welles performed a dramatic adaptation of the H. G. Wells classic War of the Worlds. 

Panic: Orson Welles broadcasts his radio show of H.G. Wells' science fiction novel The War of the Worlds in a New York studio in 1938. Many believed the realistic account of an invasion from Mars

It was the night before Halloween, and the young Welles’ program was ‘interrupted’ with an announcement from ‘Intercontinental Radio News’ that there had been a series of strange gas explosions on the planet Mars. From there, the world proceeded to end.

‘The show set off a wave of scattered but intense panic. And when listeners found out the invasion wasn’t real, boy, were they mad,’ said Schlozman.

More than a thousand people wrote to the CBS network to complain, and the newly created Federal Communications Commission fielded more than 600 letters and telegrams.

According to Schlozman, the Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency syndrome, the disease that he simply made up, now has its own website, which he did not create himself.

It appeared after he posted a fake medical paper online on the ‘putative virus that causes zombification’.

Internet hoax: The 'website' of Dwayne Medical Center, created by multimedia artist Virgil Wong, led many to believe that men were having babies

The author said another example of people believing in hoaxes was the male pregnancy ruse in 2007/2008.

This was roughly the time that the first male pregnancy was reported at the world-famous Dwayne Medical Center and word of the medical achievement spread virally online.

However, there is no such place as the Dwayne Medical Center, and of course, there’s no male pregnancy among humans.

The entire website was created by a multimedia artist named Virgil Wong.

‘It isn’t that hard to show this site to people naïve to the story and get them to believe it,’ said Schlozman. ‘As the noted skeptics Agents Mulder and Scully might suggest, the truth is out there. But when you search for it online, the truth may turn out to be whatever you need it to be.’
