A prisoner who asked warders for a Bible was offered pornographic magazines to help him ‘get to sleep’, a report has found.

Academics conducting ground-breaking research into sex among inmates in British prisons said the incident proved that it was often tolerated by staff.

Sex is not allowed in jails but former prisoners and reform groups say it is widespread and mostly unprotected.

The study, for a commission established by the Howard League For Penal Reform pressure group, said some jails were not providing inmates with condoms to stop the spread of sexually-transmitted infections behind bars.

Even though sex between prisoners or with staff is not allowed, inmates are supposed to have free access to condoms if they are thought to be at risk of catching a disease.

The Commission on Sex in Prisons was established amid concerns ministers were burying their heads in the sand over the issue of sex behind bars despite the World Health Organization claiming health risks are a ‘serious problem’.

Researchers were refused permission by the Ministry of Justice to interview current prisoners. Instead, they spoke to 26 former prisoners who claimed sexual behaviour was ‘tacitly accepted’ by prison staff.

The report said: ‘One interviewee recalled how, feeling “overwhelmed and nervous” on his first night in prison, he asked the night staff for a Bible.

‘After some time, an officer returned and apologetically explained that he could not find a Bible but he could lend instead a selection of pornographic magazines “to help you get to sleep”.’

Gay and bisexual male prisoners said they were ‘fairly’ or ‘totally’ open about their sexuality on the wing, while being discreet about their sexual relationships and activities.

The research project found that the availability of condoms to minimise the risk of STIs – and the potential for them to be passed on to future lovers in the general population – was varied among prisons.

Some prisoners who were indebted to others or who had limited money for tobacco, other commodities or illegal drugs would offer sexual favours in lieu of payment, said the report.

It also claimed rapes and sexual assault in prison may be more widespread than acknowledged by the Ministry of Justice, which said there were 170 reported attacks last year.

The Howard League has spent two years looking at all elements of sex in prisons in England and Wales, from consensual to coercive sex.

Ministers insist that sex is not common in jails but that condoms are available to all prisoners from qualified members of the healthcare team.

Sex is banned but inmates should be offered protection to prevent STIs
