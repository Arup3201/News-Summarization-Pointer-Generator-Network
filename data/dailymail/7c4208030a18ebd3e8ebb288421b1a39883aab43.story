They are already at risk from oil spills, hunting and habitat destruction.

Now scientists say that decompression sickness, also known as the bends, can be a killer for endangered sea turtles.

The sickness has been diagnosed for the first time in loggerhead sea turtles and creatures that are accidentally caught in fishing nets are most likely to suffer, experts say.

Decompresion sickness, or 'the bends' has been diagnosed for the first time in loggerhead sea turtles (stock picture) and creatures caught in fishing nets by accident, are most likely to suffer, experts say

The bends is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and tissues following a sudden drop in surrounding pressure, such as when a diver rapidly ascends from a deep dive, or a turtle is pulled quickly from the depths.

In humans, it can produce many symptoms from joint pain to paralysis and death, but it is not known what animals feel.

A team of international scientists including experts from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) diagnosed the sickness, which was previously thought to only occur in humans and some whale and dolphin species that have ascended too quickly from diving.

Sea turtles are often caught accidentally in commercial fishing nets and those that appear to be active are usually released immediately back to sea.

Loggerhead turtles are the most abundant of all marine species.

But their population is declining due to pollution, shrimp trawling and the development of their nesting areas.

The species has been on the threatened species list since 1978.

They can be found in colder waters around the world but prefer costal habitats.

Loggerheads has large heads, strong jaws and a reddish-brown shell.

Adults can reach three feet long (one metre) and weigh 250lbs (113kg)

They feed on jellyfish, crabs and fish as well as seaweed.

Adult females swim thousands of miles to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs.

They have an average lifespan of 50 years and have a top speed of 15mp (24kph). 

This study, published in the journal Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, suggests that some live turtles, while appearing initially active, possibly have the bends and may die following release.

‘This is the first time that the bends has been confirmed in a marine reptile,’ Dr Paul Jepson, co-author of the study and marine vet at ZSL said.

‘It also shows that endangered sea turtles accidentally caught in fishing nets are at risk of dying, even if they initially appear to be still alive when brought up to the sea surface.

‘Ideally we want to avoid sea turtles being caught in commercial fishing activities but, if they are, I hope that this research will make fisheries more vigilant about unintentionally catching sea turtles and the risks of decompression sickness from rapid ascent.’

In the study, 29 sea turtles accidentally caught in commercial fishing nets off the coast of Spain were found to suffer from the bends.

Two of the creatures were treated with human recompression protocols carried out at Oceanographic in Valencia, and responded well. They were subsequently released back into the Mediterranean Sea.

The findings have direct implications for the conservation of sea turtles, because many more may die as a result of commercial fishing activities than previously thought.

Marine turtle populations are declining in the Mediterranean Sea, and six out of seven sea turtle species are endangered worldwide.

Divers can avoid the bends by making safety stops and ascending gradually at a pace of less than 10 metres a minute (stock image)

Decompression sickness, or the bends, is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and tissues following a sudden drop in the surrounding pressure, such as when a diver rapidly ascends from a deep dive.

Nitrogen makes up 70 per cent of the air we breathe and during a dive, large amounts of the gas are taken into the body’s tissues, because the diver - or animal - is breathing at a higher pressure than if they were at the surface.

The quantities of dissolved nitrogen depend on the depth and length of the dive, NetDoctor reported. The deeper and longer the dive, the more nitrogen is taken up by the body.

As a diver begins the journey to the water’s surface, the surrounding pressure falls and nitrogen is exhaled.

But if they ascend too quickly, the gas forms bubbles in the blood and tissue.

This can be avoided by making safety stops and ascending gradually at a pace of less than 32ft (10metres) a minute.

In humans, the bends can produce symptoms including severe pains in the joints and chest, skin irritation, cramps, and paralysis, which can lead to death. It is not known what animals feel.

It is treated with pure oxygen and fluid at the site of the accident. Later, a diver may have to sit in a decompression chamber - a steel tank that's pressurised.

Lasting for around six hours, the pressure inside the chamber is increased to correspond to the pressure found some 59 ft (18metres) or more, under water and then gradually reduced again until the diver reaches surface pressure.

The bends is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and tissues following a sudden drop in the surrounding pressure, such as when a diver rapidly ascends from a deep dive, or a turtle is pulled quickly from the depths. Humans are treated in decompression chambers (pictured)
