Two teenagers had to be rescued by firefighters on Saturday after the chuck of ice they'd foolishly stepped onto broke away from the shore and started floating out into Lake Michigan.

The males, ages 17 and 18, were roughly 40 yards into the lake when the Racine Fire Department arrived to rescue them just after 12:40 p.m., reports The Journal Times.

Three divers in scuba gear from the department had to swim out to rescue the pair.

The firefighters, with help from Kenosha's Coast Guard, gave the teens life vests to put on and then pushed the chunk of ice back to shore.

They then put a ladder down for the two to climb back to safety. Neither teenager was injured, reports Racine Uncovered.

The incident took place at the beach behind Racine Zoo. Frequent visitors to the lake say it is currently difficult to tell where the beach ends and the ice begins.

The incident is the second strange ice rescue this week - on Thursday a U.S. Coast Guard ship was cutting ice on frozen-over Lake St Clair when they came across a young man walking out on the ice alone in sub-freezing temperatures.

When crew members brought the curious 25-year-old man on board, he said he was trying to walk from Detroit to Toronto.

Detroit lies on the southwestern shore of Lake St Clair, and the unidentified ice-walker was found just half a mile from Seaway Island on the opposite shore. From there it's a 201-mile journey on land to reach Toronto.

For the second consecutive winter, bitter weather has threatened to turn the surface of the Great Lakes into a vast, frozen plain.

During February there were days when as much as 85 percent of the lakes' surface area was covered with ice, the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory has reported.

Records show the lakes' most widespread freeze was 94.7 percent in 1979. The ice cover topped out at 92.2 percent last March.

Significant portions of the lakes typically froze over decades ago, Leshkevich said, but the frequency of severe winters has declined since the late 1990s.

'Two almost record-setting years back to back would be very unusual,' he said.

One likely explanation for the rapid buildup this month is that 2014's freeze lasted so long — Lake Superior wasn't completely ice-free until June — and summer was so mild that the lakes didn't absorb much heat, he said. 'So we started this season with below-water temperatures to begin with.'

Rescued: The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man on Thursday morning, who they found walking alone on the middle of frozen-over Lake St Clair 

The ice blanket reaches across more than 90 percent of Lakes Superior, Huron and Erie, while Lakes Michigan and Ontario are more than halfway covered.

It has produced some spectacular visual images, from ice caves along the Lake Michigan shoreline to a glacial buildup making it appear that Niagara Falls had frozen in place.

But it's a headache for the Coast Guard, whose cutters open channels for vessels hauling vital cargo such as heating oil and road salt. 

The Detroit-based tug Bristol Bay has struggled for days to free the Arthur M. Anderson, a freighter stranded about 70 miles east of Cleveland in ice up to 10 feet thick. 

The Canadian Coast Guard has dispatched an icebreaker to assist.

The job has taken so much longer than expected that the Bristol Bay's crew ran low on food and had to receive a delivery by helicopter, which lowered supplies in their rescue basket.

Things will get even busier in mid-March, when the shipping season begins for the lakes' regular traffic of vessels carrying iron ore, coal, grain and other bulk cargo.

'We're probably going to be looking at situations like we had last year, where we had to put together convoys — lots of vessels together to make it through,' Coast Guard spokesman Lorne Thomas said.
