A traffic warden is fighting for his life in hospital after claims he was savagely beaten by a driver because he gave the man a parking ticket.

The warden, who is in his 40s, is understood to have been hit over the head with a piece of wood in Bounds Green, north London, just before 4.45 yesterday afternoon.

Police say they arrested a 29-year-old man on suspicion of GBH half an hour after the attack, while the victim remains in a 'serious but stable' condition.

Onlookers described a 'running battle' along busy Myddelton Road as both men hit out at each other before the parking warden collapsed.

An anonymous source who spoke to the Evening Standard said: 'I broke them up but the warden continued to fight as well. At one point the warden picked up the man and threw him.

'At another stage the warden was on the ground and the man was repeatedly punching him in the face. It was really sickening. He is lucky to be alive.'Â 

Meanwhile another witness, Afroulla Yiannopoulou, 48, told the paper that a first aider and a passing nurse stopped to help before an ambulance arrived.

A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said the traffic warden was taken as a priority to hospital with a head injury, while a second man was also injured.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called to Myddleton Road, Bounds Green, shortly before 4.45pm on Tuesday to reports of an assault.

'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended and found two injured males.

'One, a traffic warden, had suffered a serious head injury after being struck with a blunt object. He has been taken to an east London hospital where his condition is serious but stable.

'A second male sustained a non-life-threatening eye injury and was taken to a central London hospital for treatment.

'Around an hour after the incident a 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of GBH and taken into custody at a north London police station. Officers from Haringey are investigating.'
