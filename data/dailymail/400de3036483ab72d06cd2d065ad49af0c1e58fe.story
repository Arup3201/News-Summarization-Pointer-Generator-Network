At first glance, this might look like the most expensive traffic jam in history.

But the drivers of this 964-strong Ferraris convoy are in fact car-enthusiasts, who have descended upon the race circuit to smash a world record.

The flash supercars, worth more than £100 million in total, are part of a world record parade of the iconic Italian carmaker.

Fanatics from across Europe went to the Silverstone race circuit in Northamptonshire in the hope of beating the 2008 record of 490 set in Japan.

Owners from across Europe smashed the previous record held by Japan with almost twice as many Ferraris lapping the world famous racetrack on Saturday

And they smashed that figure when almost twice as many Ferraris lapped the world famous racetrack on Saturday.

Ferrari today estimated the fleet of 964 cars boasted more than 500,000bhp - with models from the past 40 years taking part.

There were so many Ferraris taking part that there was only 250m of road free on the 3.6 mile track.

F1 ace Felipe Massa led the pack from behind the wheel of a black Ferrari 458 Spider.

Speaking after setting a new World Record, Felipe Massa said: 'It was a really unforgettable experience.

'It's a great honour for me to be here for such a special event, with so many cars all brought together on one race track, which produced an unprecedented spectacle for all Prancing Horse fans.'

There were a number of million-pound Ferrari Enzos in the convoy as well as the iconic Ferrari F40 - which are worth around £400,000 each.

It is estimated the total value of the Italian convoy was well in excess of £100 million.

Dave Whiteley, 61, a semi-retired engineer from Birmingham, drove his 1983 Ferrari 308 in the parade.

He said: 'I've never seen so many Ferraris in one place and I've been a member of the Ferrari Owner's Club for 14 years.

'It's incredible, a lot of people appreciate Ferraris and this has made a lot of people's day. I took part in the 2007 record and then the Japanese beat it.

'Hopefully today has made it impossible for them to beat. It has been exceptional.'

The record- breaking convoy took Ferrari and the Ferrari Owners Club of Great Britain more than nine months to organise.

Peter Everingham, secretary of the Ferrari Owners Club for the past 20 years, was at the front of the pack. He said: 'It was a unique experience to be in the course car ahead of more than 900 other Ferraris.

'It is something that might never happen again and I am so proud to have been involved in the event.

'The enthusiasm from everyone was palpable, the whole feeling was extraordinary.'

In 2007, Ferrari managed to get 385 models onto Silverstone at a racing day to set a record.

But this was beaten the following year when the Ferrari Owners Club in Japan achieved 490 cars at the Fuji Speedway Circuit.

For every car which took part, Ferrari donated £5 to 'BEN', the automotive industry charity.
