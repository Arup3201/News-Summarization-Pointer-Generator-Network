It's a question that divides families and friends, men from women and North from South: Do you prefer brown sauce, red sauce... or no sauce at all?

Well, it seems that we like tomato ketchup the best.

In a survey, 50 per cent said they prefer ketchup overall, with 34 per cent voting for brown and the other 16 per cent undecided or preferring no sauce.

Ketchup is king: Red sauce has been voted the best overall, beating its brown rival into second place in a survey commissioned by website Ask Jeeves

But things change when it comes to bacon sandwiches. Some 42 per cent choose brown against 32 per cent for red, and 26 per cent who like neither.

Ketchup gets the vote from women, adults aged 44 and under, and those living in London, the South East and the South West.

It is also the overwhelming choice as an accompaniment to chips – 60 per cent against 16 per cent – with only the Scots demanding brown.

Men say brown is best on sausages but women prefer ketchup.  Older Britons are more likely to ask for brown sauce, particularly if they are men, as are people in the North West and Wales.

Hearty victory: When it comes to bacon sandwiches, however, more people choose brown sauce over ketchup

Bacon sandwich – brown 42 per cent, red 32 per cent, neither 26 per cent;

Chips – brown 16 per cent, red 60 per cent, neither 24 per cent;

Sausages – brown 45 per cent, red 35 per cent, neither 20 per cent;

Eggs (fried or scrambled) – brown 21 per cent, red 30 per cent, neither 49 per cent;

Toasted cheese sandwich – brown 28 per cent, red 17 per cent, neither 55 per cent.

Overall – brown 34 per cent, red 50 per cent, neither 16 per cent

The website Ask Jeeves decided to commission the survey of 1,000 adults after receiving frequent questions about which sauce was best with each food.

But a spokesman for Ask Jeeves admitted: ‘Somehow, I don’t think this will settle the argument once and for all.’

While it is all a question of taste, it is clear that some habits have formed whether it is by region, gender or age.

Older Britons are more likely to ask for brown sauce, as those in areas like the North West and Wales for instance.

London and the south east has a clear preference for red while other regions vary a lot more from food to food, said Ask Jeeves.

Men are more likely than women to demand brown on most foods, except chips, and brown is also more popular among older generations in general but men in particular.

A spokeswoman for Ask Jeeves said: 'The results of the poll confirms that the great issue of red or brown continues to split the nation.

'Maybe brown is more an acquired taste, it certainly seems to get more popular the older you get.

'Red appears more popular overall but somehow I don’t think this will settle the argument once and for all.'
