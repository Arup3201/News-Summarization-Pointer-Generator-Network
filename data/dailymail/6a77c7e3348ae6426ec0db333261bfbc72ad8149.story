Marouane Fellaini appeared to land a nasty elbow to the face of Joe Allen during Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales on Sunday night.

The Manchester United and Belgium midfielder was caught on camera as his elbow collided with the face of his Welsh opponent, before escaping without punishment.

The incident, midway through the second half of Belgium's 0-0 draw with Chris Coleman's Wales, resulted in Allen having to temporarily leave the field, his face gushing with blood.

Fellaini was given a yellow card last season when he elbowed Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta

It is not the first time Fellaini has been involved in an incident of this nature. In March, he was criticised for an elbow on Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta which resulted in a yellow card.

And on the first day of the season, Fellaini appeared to land a blow to the face of Swansea midfielder Ki Sung-yueng; the outcome this time a yellow card to Ki.

The 26-year-old has twice courted controversy when he appeared to spit on an opponent, formerly in the aftermath of the Zabaleta elbow, and recently on Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero.

Wales held on for an invaluable point in Belgium, a result which leaves them top of Group B after four matches.
