It was an emotional day for Jose Mourinho as he lifted his first trophy since returning to Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday evening.

It ended a 'drought' of 914 days since Mourinho last won a competition, and the Chelsea boss looked close to tears at the final whistle, before celebrating the success with captain John Terry and the rest of his team. 

Mourinho heaped praise on his players after winning the 21st trophy of his managerial career, above all on those who did not even play in the final but had played a big part in getting the Blues there, such as Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Luis.

However, with another London derby against West Ham coming up in the Premier League in midweek, the Portuguese also said Sunday's celebrations would be kept to a minimum - 20 minutes to be precise.

In lauding his entire squad, rather than just those who featured on Sunday, Mourinho said: 'We took the competition seriously. Everyone was fantastic in this run.

'All these guys are men of the match for me, maybe more than John (Terry) and maybe more than the lucky ones to play this final.

'I feel really sorry for the other ones who didn't play, so for me they are the man of the match because this is a team.'

He added: 'I'm really proud of the guys, but celebrations in 20 minutes, (then) over, goodbye, train tomorrow, we have another game on Wednesday.'

Mourinho was quick to praise Tottenham and their manager Mauricio Pochettino after the match as well.

He said: 'I'm really happy. I think I should start by talking about Tottenham and about Mauricio, because they are a fantastic team.

'He's building a great team, they gave us a very difficult match and I feel sorry for them. He (Pochettino) is doing a fantastic work and is having a great evolution in his career.'
