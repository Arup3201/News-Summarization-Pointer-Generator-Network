With Christmas around the corner, many chefs might be wondering how to add the wow-factor to their roasts.

They might want to consider an elaborate recipe made by Tudor chefs, who crafted monstrous roasts by stitching pigs and chickens together to make a truly memorable meal.

Tudor chefs came up with the idea of the ‘cockenthrice,’ which can take the form a pig’s upper body sewn onto the lower body of a turkey – including the bird’s long legs.

Tudor chefs came up with the idea of the 'cockenthrice,' which can be a pig's upper body sewn onto the lower body of a turkey - including the bird's long legs, as is pictured here. The dish has been recreated by an experimental historian

Originally created in the 15th Century, the recipe was revived in later years with a mixture of animals and has been recently recreated by one experimental historian, The Atlantic reported.

Richard Fitch, the project coordinator for the historic kitchens at Hampton Court Palace, Greater London, which regularly served extravagant meals to king Henry VIII, recreates meals described in historic cookery books and writes about them for his blog.

He made the cockenthrice based upon an old recipe that instructs a cook to boil and drain the animals before slicing them in half at the waist and sewing them together so that the pig’s upper body is on the chicken’s lower body and vice versa.

The recipe then demands that the chef stuff the creature as he would a pig and then ‘putte hem on a spete, and Roste hym’ which means roasting the meat on a spit over an open fire.

Just before the creation is ready, the recipe says to brush egg yolk mixed with a little saffron, ginger and the juice of parsley over the meat so that it goes golden.

The recipe suggests the chef should ‘erue it forth for a ryal mete’ or serve it quickly for a royal meat option.

While the dishes were designed to be culinary show-stoppers, they were by no means the most complex Tudor dishes for raucous dinner parties.

Some were designed to be the entertainment as well as the main course and one, called Rôti Sans Pareil was an intricate version of Turducken, which is a a duck stuffed inside a chicken stuffed inside a turkey.

It was created by stuffing 17 birds into one another like Russian dolls, ranging from the smallest at the centre of the dish – the Warbler – to the largest – a Giant Bustard.

Historians believe the cockenthrice might have been inspired by explorers’ trips to the Americas and the tales of strange animals which lived there.

They also suggested that the Tudors’ love of classical civilisations with their many hybrid animals and monsters, might have provided inspiration.

For anyone contemplating cooking up a feast fit for a Tudor king this Christmas, historical chefs at Hampton Court Palace are offering live cookery demonstrations in the palace's vast old kitchen.

Heston Blumenthal has also recreated the dish as part of his television series, Heston's Feasts
