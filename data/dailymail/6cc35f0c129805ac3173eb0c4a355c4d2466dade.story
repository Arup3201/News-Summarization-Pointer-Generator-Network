A man wanted in connection with the murder of a suspected London drugs gang boss has been named by police.

Detectives want to talk to Jamie Marsh-Smith, 23, after Zafer Eren was shot dead outside his home in Southgate, north London, in April.

The shooting of Mr Eren, thought to have been a senior figure in a Turkish drugs gang, is believed to have been part of an ongoing 'turf war' between two rival gangs which has been linked to around 15 deaths in the capital.

Police have offered a Â£30,000 reward to anyone who can help catch Eren's killers.

Witnesses to the April 18 shooting said they saw a masked gunman flee in a burgundy Peugeot 308 after killing Mr Eren, who had a month-old baby.

Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: 'Today we need the public to help us trace and arrest Jamie Marsh-Smith. We are keen to speak to him in connection with the murder of Zafer Eren.

'We know that allegiances shift over time and now months on from Zafer's murder, people may have the confidence to talk to us.'

Two other shootings are being investigated as part of the same inquiry - one on April 22 in Tottenham, north London, where the victim managed to escape; and the other on December 30 2012 in Lower Edmonton, north London.

Scotland Yard believes that Mr Eren's murder was part of violent tensions between the Tottenham Boys and the Bombacilar (Bombers) for control of the heroin trade in north London.

So far a 20-year-old man has already been charged with the murder of Mr Efren and is due to stand trial at the Old Bailey on November 11.

Det Chief Insp McHugh added: 'Anyone with information of the whereabouts of Jamie Marsh-Smith is asked to call the incident room on 020 7321 7228 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

'For an immediate sighting of him, please call 999.'
