A young ballerina has given an insight into her punishing daily routine, after creating a video diary.

Australian performer Benedicte Bemet is a member of the Australian Ballet Company.

The 20-year-old dancer is a coryphée - ranking above a member of the corps de ballet and below a soloist.

The video begins showing Benedicte travelling to rehearsals at 9am.

An hour later she begins a Pilates session, which she explains helps her get in the right frame of mind for an evening’s performance.

At 12.30pm she begins a one-to-one training session with one of the Austalian Ballet’s teachers.

Two hours later she is given a massage session before taking lunch at 3.30pm.

During her afternoon break, Benedicte explains that she does sewing in order to help herself relax before she goes on stage at 8pm. 

At 6.30pm, Benedict begins to get ready for the evening show, putting on make-up and changing into her costume.

At 7.55pm she is ready to go on stage for her 90-minute performance.

Shortly after, she heads backstage for an ice bath to help her body recover from the rigours of the performance before she finally heads home around 10pm.

Benedicte was born in Mackay in 1994, and started ballet at the age of three.

She grew up on the Gold Coast and began her training at the Ransley's Ballet Centre.

When she was ten her family relocated to Hong Kong, where she continued her ballet training at the Jean M. Wong School of Ballet.

She left her family in Hong Kong to move to Melbourne a and was accepted into the Australian Ballet School when she was 14.

A year later she was given an award for excellence and was sent to New York and Canada to represent the school in the exchange program.

Benedicte toured with The Dancer's Company in both 2010 and 2011, and was offered a contract with the company two years ago.

'It was really difficult to leave my family but it’s all paid off now,' she says. 'My parents have never been anything but completely supportive my entire life. I owe everything to them.'

After working her way through the ranks of The Australian Ballet Company, she was later promoted to coryphée and was awarded the People’s Choice Award in the 2013 Telstra Ballet Dancer Awards.

Since joining the Australian Ballet Company at the age of 14, Benedict says that she has worn out 123 pairs of point shoes and the 20-year-old admits the hours can be hard.

She said: ‘You put your body through a lot of stress but it’s worth it, I love dancing and there are so many parts I’d love to dance one day. I want to be Juliet in Romeo and Juliet and Odette in Swan Lake.

Like anything you are passionate about, it can make you so happy and of course there are days when it can make you quite upset if you are disappointed in yourself.

‘But you put your point shoes on and you get up and what’s most important is still coming.’
