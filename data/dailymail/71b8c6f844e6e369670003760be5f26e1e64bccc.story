A man has sued a New Hampshire cemetery after discovering that someone else is buried in his plot.

Kenneth Dame bought the plot for himself and his wife at Bayside Cemetery in Laconia in 1987.

Due to an administrative error, restaurateur Michael Girardi, who died last year, is buried next to 11 members of the Dame family.

Kenneth Dame says the plot he bought at Bayside Cemetery in Laconia, New Hampshire, is now occupied by a total stranger

Now buried in the Dame family plot is Michael Girardi, a restaurateur who died last year and was placed in the lot due to an administrative error

Girardi's family has not given permission to have him reburied at a different plot.

'This is Michael’s home,' said Girardi's long-time girlfriend, Carol Clancy, to WMUR. 'This became Michael’s home, and that’s why he’s buried there.' 

Clancy said Girardi died unexpectedly of a heart attack in August 2013. 

'All of us were grief-stricken,' she told WMUR. 'Nobody in a million years thought that this was another family’s grave site, and even when we found out, we were just horrified. What do we do?'

Carol Clancy (left) says there's no easy solution to fix the mistake that landed her long-time boyfriend Michael Girardi (right) in the wrong cemetery plot. So far, Girardi's family has refused every offer from Kenneth Dame

Dame's lawsuit says he was offered another double plot, about 60 feet away. 

Dame's lawyer said the proposed solution 'is much too far for him to agree to.'

Cemetery Trustee Edwin Burliegh declined to comment.

A lawyer for the cemetery said it could take several months before a judge comes to a decision.
