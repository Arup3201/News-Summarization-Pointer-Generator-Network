Housed in a dome almost the size of Big Ben and containing a mirror nearly half the length of a football pitch, it wasn’t exactly rocket science for astronomers to find a name for this telescope.

And, sure enough, they came up with the European Extremely Large Telescope – just about the only routine thing about the world’s largest and most powerful ‘eye on the sky’.

Astronomers reckon it may finally shed light on whether there really is life somewhere out there by helping them find Earth-like rocky worlds that are home to other beings.

And British scientists might be among the first to find out – as their work is crucial to the project.

Key
instruments for the telescope will be developed thanks to £3.5million 
funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council. 

The device in the Atacama Desert, Chile, will be built in a dome that covers an area the size of a stadium.

It
has a sensitivity to visible and infrared light tens of times greater 
than any previous telescope, and is designed to help astronomers peer 
back to the first galaxies 14billion years ago.

This
could unlock secrets of dark matter and dark energy – little-understood
forces in space – to help explain how the universe evolved, according 
to the plans.

The British 
instruments are being developed by the universities of Durham and 
Oxford, with the UK Astronomy Technology Centre and Rutherford Appleton 
Laboratory.

They will include spectrometers to 
analyse the light received from space, as well as gadgets to help remove
blurring distortions caused by the Earth’s atmosphere, a process known 
as adaptive optics.

This will produce pictures 15 times sharper than those taken by the Hubble space telescope, which has been in orbit since 1990.

Professor
Isobel Hook, E-ELT project scientist at the University of Oxford, said:
‘This new financial commitment from the STFC means that UK astronomers 
will have access to the earliest scientific results from this 
revolutionary telescope – an exciting prospect.’

It is believed the telescope will 
bring hundreds of millions of pounds of benefits to British companies 
involved in building it.

They
include a consortium based at the OpTIC Technium in North Wales, which 
is developing prototypes for the huge segments needed to make the 
43-yard mirror.

Engineers 
will have to blast the top off Chile’s 9,900ft Cerro Armazones mountain 
peak to build the telescope if final approval is given by the European 
Southern Observatory’s 15 international partners in December. It is 
hoped the observatory will be operating by 2020.

The E-ELT will be the latest tool to join observatories operated in Chile by Europe.

The Atacama is a favoured location because the dryness and clarity of the air provide exceptional observing conditions.

Established
telescopes include the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, a set of dishes 
that forms the highest observatory in the world at 16,000ft.
