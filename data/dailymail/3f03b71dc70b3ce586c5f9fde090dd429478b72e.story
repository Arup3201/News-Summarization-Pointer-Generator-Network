Manchester United striker Robin van Persie has put his early season dip in form down to finding it 'difficult to get back into the flow' after competing in international tournaments with Holland.

Van Persie played a major role in the Dutch national team's progress to the World Cup semi-finals under the guidance of now Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal.

The Red Devils star took part in Holland's World Cup play-off match against Brazil on July 12 before joining up with his Manchester United team-mates on August 4 after being given an extended break by Van Gaal.

The 31-year-old was part of the Dutch national team which reached the 2014 World Cup semi-finals 

Van Persie, speaking to Sky Sports before his side's match against Liverpool, said: 'I have played in five tournaments now and based on the period after it was always quite difficult to get back into the flow.

'It was a tough start for me and the team. I think it was easier for me because I was working with Van Gaal for the past two years with Holland.

'You have to concentrate all the time, even before you go to bed. It is going to be a couple of intense years but great years.'

The 31-year-old, who scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season against Liverpool, believes he can play at the top level for another eight years despite struggling for consistency this season.

'When you pass 30 it is the age thing suddenly. Over the years I have been hearing loads of things such as I am injury prone but now it is age.

'I can play for another eight years. I can play for a number of years at the highest level.'
