More than 100 secret documents detailing the private discussions between Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and George W Bush before the Iraq war are set to be declassified and published.

The Mail has learned senior civil servants are ‘close’ to a deal to let the Chilcot Inquiry into the war publish the documents after more than a year of wrangling.

Records of telephone conversations between Mr Blair and Mr Bush, notes between the two men and even papers documenting Cabinet discussions on the war are expected to be released to the public.

Private notes: George W Bush and Tony Blair in February 2001

Senior Whitehall sources say that the 
papers are likely to be published within three months - clearing the way
 for the publication of the report, nearly five years after Sir John 
Chilcot began his inquiries.

Sir John has repeatedly complained that he has been prevented from publishing his conclusions because Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was blocking publication of the key papers on which his judgments were based.

Last month Sir John wrote to David Cameron to say the Cabinet Office had ‘not reached a final position’ on whether to release the requested documents.

But a senior Government source has now revealed that Sir Jeremy intends to release as many papers as possible, in contrast to his predecessor Sir Gus O’Donnell, who counselled against publishing any of the Cabinet discussions or private notes between prime ministers and Mr Bush.

The source said yesterday that ‘good progress’ had been made towards declassifying many of the records and added: ‘There will be a lot more than people were expecting.’

Some of the contents of the documents will be blacked out for national security reasons and to prevent US and British relations being damaged.

Release: Telephone records, notes and even documents from Cabinet discussions are to be made public

However, the source said: ‘There is an 
ongoing process of declassification, which is attempting to strike a 
balance to ensure you are not setting a legal precedent that could 
oblige you to publish other documents in the future or damage national 
security.

‘There are likely to be some redactions - but only where absolutely necessary. The intention is to be transparent.’

The documents at issue include up to 200 Cabinet-level discussions on the Iraq war, notes sent between Mr Blair and Mr Bush, and more than 130 records of conversations between either Mr Blair or Mr Brown and the White House.

Tony Blair’s spokesman said: ‘The inquiry of course had full access to all documents, including all the confidential correspondence between president Bush and then prime minister, Mr Blair.

‘In addition, Mr Blair agreed at the last inquiry hearing to answer questions in a way that specifically revealed the contents of the correspondence on the issues that interested the inquiry.’

But Mr Blair told Sir John: ‘I think it is extremely important that the British prime minister and the American president are able to communicate in confidence, and if something is given in confidence it should be treated like that, but I am very happy to tell you the basis of what I said.’

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The Government is currently engaged in discussions with the inquiry, which the inquiry recognises raises difficult issues, including legal and international relations issues.

‘These issues are being worked through in good faith and with a view to reaching a position as rapidly as possible.

‘The inquiry should be allowed to publish its findings and we should not pre-empt the content of the report.’
