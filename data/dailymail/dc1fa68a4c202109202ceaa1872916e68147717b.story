With their well-pressed shirts and Cath Kidston totes at the ready, these shoppers look like they're waiting patiently for the farmers' market to open, or perhaps a new branch of Boden.

In fact, the queuers - all 300 of them - are waiting for a new Aldi store to open - the discount supermarket that has become the darling of the recession-hit middle classes.

Demonstrating perfectly how the well-heeled have taken the German chain to their hearts, they parked their Aston Martins, Jaguars and Range Rovers and then queued politely from 3am for the opening of the supermarket in Knutsford, in Cheshire.

Affluent locals in Knutsford, once dubbed Tory Utopia, were keen to get their hands on an Aldi bargain

Having an Aldi, which does not do internet delivery, nearby is now something to be proud of rather than ashamed, and the Cheshire set were happy to wait in line for the no-frills supermarket to open its doors.

Locals in the town, deep in Chancellor George Osborne's solidly middle-class constituency of Tatton, Cheshire, rejected Aldi when it tried to open a supermarket there in 2008.

But times have changed.

Voted both Grocer Of The Year and Supermarket Of The Year last month, Aldi is now a shop to be seen in, with those in the know boasting of their finds there.

It does not stock any of the big brands like Hellmann's or Kellogg's, but it has won awards for the taste and quality of its own brand alternatives, which come at a fraction of the price.

Middle-class shoppers flock to Aldi for its Prosecco, its rose wine, and its seeded bread.  Its cleaning products are also highly regarded, as is its gin.

What to buy: The Grocer magazine named Aldi Grocer Of The Year and gave 16 products a coveted gold medal

The Knutsford shoppers knew all this: more than 2,500 people visited the new Aldi on its first day of business, hundreds of whom had queued since dawn to be sure of getting in when the doors opened at 8am.

Staff arriving for their first day trading were surprised to see the queue snaking round the car park, and handed out Willy Wonka-style golden envelopes containing prizes to the first 100 people in line.

There were also prizes of Prosecco and flowers, televisions and hampers, as well as samples of its award-winning range of foods.

Store manager Mike Taylor said: 
'There has been a hugely positive response from the Knutsford community 
to the opening of our new store, and it was so pleasing to see hundreds 
of shoppers queueing outside before 8am.

Gleaming cars waited in the car park - Knutsford is known for the affluence of its 13,000 inhabitants

Affluent Knutsford, in Cheshire's Golden Triangle, rejected Aldi in 2008 but has embraced it now

Aldi has seen sales rise by 31.5 per cent this year, outpacing Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons.  It keeps its overheads down with minimalist store interiors, few staff, and charged-for plastic bags.

The supermarket has made a huge effort to attract the middle classes, introducing a range of superior products at budget prices on olive oils, spirits, wine, coffee, and Aberdeen Angus steaks. Its own-brand Champagne, gin and Prosecco have all won awards, while many of its wines have been hailed by critics.

With its wine bars and designer boutiques, affluent Knutsford is the epitome of comfortable, aspirational Tory Britain - the perfect location for a new Aldi.

Desirable: Knutsford lies within George Obsborne's Tatton constituency and is a sought-after place to live

Lying within the Cheshire Golden Triangle of villages favoured by celebrities and entrepreneurs, Knutsford is surrounded by rolling countryside but also just 15 miles from Manchester and five miles from its airport.

With 13,000 inhabitants, the leafy town is staunchly Conservative, barring a blip from 1997 to 2001 when independent former television journalist Martin Bell stole the seat of Tatton from Tory Neil Hamilton, in disgrace over the cash for questions row.

George Osborne won the Tatton seat back for the Conservatives in 2001 and has held it ever since.

Popular local events include the RHS Tatton flower show, and the Cheshire County Show in nearby Tabley.
