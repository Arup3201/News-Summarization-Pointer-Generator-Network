The rain was of almost biblical proportions as the Queen made an historic Diamond Jubilee visit to Northern Ireland yesterday.

Indeed her ground-breaking trip was briefly delayed as her plane from London to Enniskillen had to be diverted to Belfast because of the weather.

The Queen arrived slightly late in County Fermanagh by helicopter.

Delight: Thousands of well-wishers gathered to give The Queen a warm welcome as she arrived in Enniskillen on her Diamond Jubilee tour

Visit: The monarch wore a powder blue coat and hat with white detail for the first day of the historic trip

But the conditions did not deter 
people turning out in their thousands to greet her as she and Prince 
Philip travelled into the town by car for a service of thanksgiving at 
Enniskillen Cathedral.

The Queen’s two-day tour is 
particularly momentous as today she will – almost certainly under the 
glare of the cameras – shake the hand of former IRA commander Martin 
McGuinness, now Northern Ireland’s Deputy First Minister.

Enniskillen was devastated by an IRA bomb during a Remembrance Day service in November 1987.

The Queen's colourful fashion choices
are often a topic of interest for royal watchers, but today's 
distinctive blue-and-white ensemble attracted more interest than usual.

The white floral design across the 
powder blue crepe wool coat and hat gave the outfit a likeness to the 
signature pottery of Wedgwood.

Indeed, while the hat is no different 
in shape to the millinery she has worn for decades, some have - perhaps 
unfairly - compared it to a covered cheese dish from the crockery 
manufacturer's iconic Jasperware collection, first designed in the late 
18th Century.

The garments, designed especially for her visit to Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, were designed by royal couturier Angela Kelly.

Her Majesty paid tribute to her hosts in the form of a dazzling diamond shamrock brooch.

The look was otherwise accessorised in
typical style, with pearl earrings and necklace, white gloves and her 
favourite black Launer bag

Eleven people were killed that day – 
with one dying later – in one of the worst atrocities of the Troubles. 
The royal couple met some of the families affected.

The Queen also went on an impromptu 
walkabout to meet dozens of the those who had been waiting patiently to 
catch a glimpse of her.

She wore a Wedgwood blue outfit and 
hat by Angela Kelly, which featured hand-embroidered white lace on the 
coat and dress, and was finished off with a shamrock diamond brooch. She
collected dozens of posies from cheering well-wishers.

Although her controversial meeting 
with Mr McGuinness is being heralded as a significant step in the peace 
process, it will undoubtedly prove difficult for the 86-year-old 
sovereign who has seen members of her own family, notably Prince 
Philip’s much-loved uncle, Earl Mounbatten of Burma, murdered by 
republicans. He was assassinated by an IRA bomb planted in his fishing 
boat in 1979.

The gesture has also been the subject 
of huge debate among Sinn Fein members. But Mr McGuinness, who still 
faces questions about the true extent of his terrorist past despite his 
move into politics, himself made clear yesterday that he approved of the
move.

‘This is about stretching out the hand
of peace and reconciliation to Queen Elizabeth who represents hundreds 
of thousands of unionists in the north,’ he said. ‘I am an Irish 
republican now. After I meet with Queen Elizabeth, I will still be an 
Irish republican, and just as passionate about freedom, justice and 
peace, and reconciliation, as I was the day before.’

Following complaints by republicans 
that the handshake could be seen as condoning the jubilee, it will now 
take place at a neutral venue – a celebration of culture at the Lyric 
Theatre in Belfast – and will also be attended by the President of 
Ireland, Michael D Higgins.

The Queen, who is making her 20th 
visit to Northern Ireland, will initially meet Mr McGuinness in private 
alongside a handful of VIPs. While a photograph of the moment was ruled 
out last week, sources have now said discussions are continuing about 
allowing the handshake to be recorded.

Yesterday, in a sign of inclusiveness,
clerics from all denominations took part in the service at the Anglican
cathedral including the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, 
Cardinal Sean Brady. The jubilee was celebrated with prayers for those 
who serve their communities.

The Queen’s trip to Enniskillen also 
saw her make her first visit to a Catholic church in either Northern 
Ireland or the Republic.

She made the short walk across the 
street from the Anglican cathedral’s deanery, where she privately met 
seven survivors of the Enniskillen bombing, to St Michael’s, where she 
met community groups.

just as passionate about freedom, justice and peace, and reconciliation,
as I was the day before.'

It is the Queen's 20th trip to Northern Ireland since ascending to the throne in 1952.
