A woman who had been quarantined at Newark Airport due to stricter screening protocols on Friday after reporting contact with Ebola victims was seen exiting an ambulance in a hazmat suit later that evening as she made her way into an isolation unit at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said the woman arrived at the airport on a flight on Friday from West Africa. He earlier announced that additional screening protocols were being implemented  at JFK and Newark International Airports.

The woman, who initially showed no symptoms of the deadly virus, just  hours later developed a fever according to the New York Times.

But she has now tested negative for the virus.

New rules: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left, listens as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie talks at a news conference on Friday. The governors announced a mandatory quarantine for  'high risk' people

The governors issued a mandatory quarantine for travelers who have had contact with Ebola-infected patients in West Africa.

Any person traveling from the three West African nations who had contact with infected, or possibly infected, people will be automatically quarantined for 21 days. This includes doctors.

It will be coordinated with local health departments. 

The Governor tweeted on Friday: 'Today, a healthcare worker arrived at Newark Airport, w/ a recent history of treating patients w/ Ebola in West Africa, but w/ no symptoms.' 

He said that the New Jersey Department of Health determined that a legal quarantine order should be issued.

He added: 'This woman, while her home residence is outside of this area, her next stop was going to be here in NY.' 

On person who did not know about Friday's announcement was New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, whose people revealed that neither he or the city's Department of Health were notified about this new policy change.

What's more, they do not seem to be completely in favor of the measures taken by Cuomo and Christie. 

'The mayor wants to work closely with our state partners, but he wants to make sure that there will not be any sort of chilling effect on medical workers who might want to go over to help,' said spokesman Phil Walzak.

Also on Friday, the Illinois Department of Public Health announced a mandatory 21-day home quarantine for high-risk individuals who have had direct contact with an individual infected with the Ebola virus while in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, this according to ABC 7.
