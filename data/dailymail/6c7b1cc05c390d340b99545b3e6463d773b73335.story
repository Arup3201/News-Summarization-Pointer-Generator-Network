The man accused of shooting dead 12 cinema goers and injuring 58 others at a midnight showing of the Dark Knight Rises was involved with a number of different prostitutes in the months before the massacre, it has been alleged.

It was reported last week that alleged Colorado shooter James Holmes had visited and posted on a number of sex websites. Sources told TMZ that he also wrote on a message board specifically for potential clients to write reviews for hookers in the Colorado area.

A number of posts on the message board went up under Holmes' alleged screen name. In the posts, he writes detail about a number of sexual experiences he had with different prostitutes - some of them more than once.

Bizarre behavior: James Holmes, pictured at his first court appearance on Monday, was involved with a number of prostitutes in the months before the massacre

James Holmes has been forced to wear a face guard in prison because he will not stop spitting at guards

When TMZ spoke to three of the hookers Holmes' allegedly rated on the forum, two of them said they couldn't be sure if it was the same guy while a third said she was positive she had met up with more on more than one occasion and maybe as recently as last August.

The woman, who goes by the name Tiffany told TMZ: 'I had no issues with him…he was really nice.

'He felt bad that I wasn’t getting more customers while in Colorado, so he called a few days later and we met up again.'

The news comes the day after it emerged that Holmes has been forced to wear a face guard as he keeps spitting at the guards there.

It was also revealed that when authorities placed evidence bags over the 24-year-old's hands to preserve gunshot residue, he began playing with them as if they were two puppets, the sources told CALL7.

He is being held in isolation at the Arapahoe County Jail but the continual spitting has forced authorities to cover his face while he is being moved.

It is just the latest example of Holmes'
 bizarre behavior and comes as his mother revealed she feared he had 
been disturbed for years and was concerned about his social isolation.

Arlene
 Holmes, who lives in San Diego, California and was only made aware of 
the shootings when a reporter called her for a comment, is said to have 
urged her son to seek counseling.

The claim in the Washington Post about 
Mrs Holmes, a nurse, is the first sign that she could have averted the 
massacre and raises grave questions over what else she knew.

When
 she was called about the shootings on Friday, she told an ABC reporter 
'you have the right person' - in an apparent indication that her son was
 the likely gunman.

But
 on Monday, her lawyer spoke out to claim Mrs Holmes's statement had 
been mischaracterised, and she had in fact been confirming that she was 
the 'right person'.

According to reports, the neuroscience 
graduate was adopted and Mrs Holmes, 58, and husband Robert, 61, a 
software developer, raised him as one of their own.

The reports come just one day after 
Holmes's startling first appearance in court on Monday, where he rolled 
his eyes, stared directly ahead and swayed from side to side.

He also displayed a disheveled mop of
 orange hair, apparently fading from the red he had dyed it in an 
attempt to resemble Batman's arch nemesis, The Joker.

He stayed silent throughout the appearance at Arapahoe County Court and at times appeared as if he was under heavy medication.

But a jail employee has claimed that the 12-minute catatonic appearance was an act, not the result of any drugs.

'We don’t just hand out meds,' the Arapahoe County Detention Center worker told the New York Daily News. 'It just doesn’t work like that. If he was acting sleepy, he was faking it.'

The source added: 'I heard he’s not cooperating. He’s trying to act crazy. I know the people here believe 
it’s an act, but only he knows for sure.'

Dr Joan Neff, a criminologist from the
 University of Virginia, told MailOnline that Holmes' appearance was 
consistent with someone who was suffering from a mental illness, such as
 schizophrenia.

She said this would also explain why he dropped out of his PhD so abruptly.

'We
 know that certain types of psychoses tend to have an onset in the early
 20s; if that's the case he may be in the midst of coping with that. He 
may not know what's going on,' she said.

Alternatively,
 she said the conditions of his jailing - especially for someone who has
 never been in trouble with the law - may have brought on an episode.

'Sometimes that can be an experience in and of itself,' Dr Neff said. 'So his appearance is not very surprising.'

Jailors at the facility agreed Holmes has been 
acting bizarrely ever since arriving and 'thinks he's acting in a 
movie', they told the New York Daily News 

'He was spitting at the door and 
spitting at the guards,' a released inmate said outside the jail. 'He’s
spitting at everything. Dude was acting crazy.'

Mental illness is something the suspected gunman would be educated in, after completing a neuroscience degree before dropping out of his PhD program last month.

Holmes was previously awarded a $26,000 federal grant from the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, part of the US Department of Health.

The sum covered a stipend and his tuition at the University of Colorado in Denver. He was one of six neuroscience students at the school to receive the money, WNEW News reported.

As
 well as mental illness, there have been other suggestions at a motive, 
including reports Holmes had recently split from a girlfriend and the 
fact he had been struggling in school before dropping out.

Whatever the
 cause, families are now reacting to the killings by unleashing lawsuits
 on the Century 16 Theater where the shooting took place, Holmes' 
doctors and Warner Brothers.

TMZ reported that Torrence Brown, Jr. was in the cinema when Holmes shot dead 12 people and wounded another 58.

One of his friends, 18-year-old A.J. 
Boik, was killed in the massacre, and Brown is now suffering from 
extreme trauma, according to his attorney Donald Karpel.

His lawsuit,
 which has not yet been filed, will name the theater, for not properly 
securing the emergency exit and Holmes’ doctors, for allegedly 
prescribing medications, as defendants.

It will also name the studio Warner Brothers, claiming that Dark Knight Rises is too violent.

Outpouring: Thousands of people continue to visit the makeshift memorial to leave gifts or messages

Never forgotten: The community continues to come together as questions remain about the killer

After his brief appearance on Monday, Holmes is back in solitary confinement - but the families of the victims said they saw enough.

'I saw the coward in court today,' said Tom Teves, whose son Alex was among those killed. 'Alex could have wiped the floor with him without breaking a sweat.'

Holmes is being held without bond and will hear the formal charges against him next Monday. The County District Attorney is considering whether to seek the death penalty.

Legal experts told the Denver Post that Holmes's attorneys are likely to pursue an insanity defense.
