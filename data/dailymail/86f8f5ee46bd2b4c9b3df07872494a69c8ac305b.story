The Queen plans to scale back her public duties and give Prince Charles a bigger role as ‘co-head’ of the royal family, well-placed sources have revealed.

Buckingham Palace and  senior figures in Whitehall  began discussing how to deal with the monarch’s advancing years several months ago, the Mail understands.

They concluded that her 64-year-old son – the longest-serving heir apparent in British history – should take a more prominent position representing the sovereign at key events, particularly those abroad.

Handing over the reigns: The Queen is reportedly planning to scale back her public 
duties and give Prince Charles a bigger role as ‘co-head’ of the royal 
family

Royal aides denied that Her Majesty¿s recent ill-health is behind the decision to increase the Prince's role

In a sign of things to come, for the first time in 17 years the Queen will be accompanied by her eldest son at the State Opening of Parliament, which takes place today. The Duchess of Cornwall will also join them.

It follows the surprise announcement by Buckingham Palace yesterday that, in a 40-year first, the Queen will not attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference. Instead, Charles will take her place at the two-day event in Sri Lanka in November.

Aides reluctantly admitted what has been suspected for some time: that the monarch, who reached the age of 87 last month, was not up to making frequent long-haul trips.

But Charles’ presence at Parliament today suggests it is also part of the carefully-choreographed plan to share the burden of responsibility.

One senior royal source told the Mail the decision for the Queen not to go to Sri Lanka was part of a ‘wide-scale review’ of her travel plans, although they insisted that it was largely ‘business as usual’.

Aides were also swift to deny that Her Majesty’s recent ill-health – she was hospitalised in March for the first time in ten years after being hit by gastroenteritis – had anything to do with the development.

But the fact is that the elderly 
monarch, who still conducts more than 300 engagements each year, has 
been gradually scaling back her diary at home too and her illness was a 
clear sign that her legendary stamina can no longer be taken for 
granted.

The Queen now spends only about three 
days a week in London or away on official visits, and prefers to read 
her official papers over a long weekend at Windsor Castle.

In addition, she is understood to be 
concerned not to put too much strain on her husband, Prince Philip, who 
will be 92 next month and still accompanies her on most trips.

It is not long since he received hospital treatment for a heart condition and a recurring bladder infection.

The Mail has also learnt that there 
has even been tentative discussion of a change in the law which would be
 required to allow Prince Charles to become regent.

Historically, regents have only been 
created when the monarch is seriously incapacitated – for instance, when
 George III was mentally unwell.

Buckingham Palace sources have said the Queen is to allow Prince Charles to take over the long-haul trips because of her age

Constitutional experts regard the idea
 of making Charles regent – an effective co-monarch – as a controversial
 and indeed unprecedented step while the Queen remains healthy.

Should 
it ever be contemplated, it would almost certainly require an amendment 
to the Regency Acts.

One well-placed source said the Queen 
would ‘never, ever abdicate’ given the unhappy family history which saw 
Edward VIII ‘abandon’  the throne in favour of the Queen’s father, 
George VI.

On the eve of her 21st birthday she 
memorably vowed to serve her country for the rest of her life, ‘whether 
it be long or short’.

‘But there is an increasing sense 
that she cannot go on as she has been,’ the source said. ‘She is 
approaching her 90s. She has extraordinary stamina for a woman of her 
age.

Significant: The Prince of Wales will represent the Queen, who is head of the Commonwealth, at the meeting in Sri Lanka in November. He is pictured recently with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall

Important: The Queen is pictured in Perth, Australia at the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting

But some of the more  challenging foreign trips are increasingly not possible for her and more particularly Prince Philip.

Prince Charles and Camilla are to attend the State Opening of Parliament today for the first time.

The royal couple will watch as the Queen sets out the government's plans for new laws for the year.

It is the first time the Prince of Wales has attended since 1996 and will fuel speculation that he is taking a more active interest in the role of monarch.

Charles and Camilla will travel in their own procession ahead of the Queen, Clarence House said.

A Clarence House spokeswoman said: 'The Prince of Wales often supports the Queen on state occasions, and his and the Duchess's diaries were clear on this occasion.'

‘Her appointments across the  board 
are going to be reviewed  and Prince Charles, who is already doing more,
 will become more prominent.

‘What is being discussed is whether 
that happens informally, as it has been for some time, or whether 
something more formal is pursued.’

Yesterday’s short statement by 
Buckingham Palace that ‘The Queen will be represented at this year’s 
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting by The Prince of Wales’ belied 
the extent of thought that had gone into it.

The Queen, who has attended every 
meeting since 1973, views her stewardship of the Commonwealth as one of 
the most important legacies of her reign and would not have taken the 
decision lightly.

The next meeting is due to be held in 
2015, when she will be 89. Unless it is held in London, her visit to the
 Perth meeting in 2011 may turn out to have been her last.

The decision to send Charles may also
 have been motivated by the fact that in recent years some Commonwealth 
countries have questioned whether the Prince of Wales should 
automatically become head of the Commonwealth when he becomes king.

Despite suggestions that the role move
 to an elected individual, the Prince feels strongly that it should be 
his, and his presence as the Queen’s representative can only strengthen 
his case.

Commonwealth Secretary-General 
Kamalesh Sharma welcomed the decision, saying: ‘This decision reflects 
the wish of Her Majesty at this time in her reign to limit her long 
distance travel.’

Significantly, a decision about the future of Charles’s own son, Prince William, is due to be announced in two weeks.

Joint visit: In 2007, both the Prince and the Queen attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Uganda. The Queen is pictured at the time

Duty: The Uganda trip was the first time Charles had been to an overseas Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and was seen as an important event for the heir to the throne

Busy: The decision to send the Prince to Sri Lanka instead of the Queen also signifies a son's commitment to easing the burden on his parents in their advancing years

It is believed that the second in line
 to the throne will quit his role as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot for
 an army ‘desk job’ which will allow him to take on more royal duties.

This will continue the move to get 
younger members of the royal family to take on more official business, 
which started in earnest last year when the Queen delegated all her 
foreign Diamond Jubilee travel to them.

That is not to say that she or Prince 
Philip, who recently returned from Toronto, won’t make any visits abroad
 at all. But they will, almost certainly, be extremely few and far 
between.

A palace source said: ‘From now on any long-haul trips will be looked at on a case by case basis.

There is no suggestion that the 
Queen’s diary will become less busy but it is part of an ongoing process
 looking at the Queen’s long-haul travel arrangements.’

According to the Queen’s official 
list of engagements, she has seven visits planned for the rest of this 
month, both with the Duke of Edinburgh.

Last night the couple attended the rededication of the refurbished Temple Church Organ in the City of London.
