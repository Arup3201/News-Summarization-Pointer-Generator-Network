French President Francois Hollande last night announced his  separation from Valerie Trierweiler – 15 days after he was caught cheating on her with an actress.

After a day of frenzied speculation, Mr Hollande announced: ‘I am making it known that I have put an end to my shared life with Valerie Trierweiler.’

Ms Trierweiler’s position has been considered untenable since Mr Hollande’s two-year affair with Julie Gayet, a 41-year-old actress, was exposed on January 10.

But the notoriously dithering socialist head of state continually claimed that it was all a ‘private matter’.

The announcement effectively ends Ms Trierweiler’s tenure as France’s First Lady.

Her
 split from Mr Hollande also means she loses her office with five staff,
 and numerous other perks including chauffeur-driven limousines and 
homes across France.

Yesterday’s
 statement came as  48-year-old Ms Trierweiler set off on a 
‘humanitarian’ visit to India, where she is expected to speak for the 
first time since the scandal broke.

Last night she tweeted her first reaction, writing: ‘All my gratitude goes to the extraordinary staff at the Elysee. I will never forget their devotion or emotion at the time of departure.’

Pointedly,
 she had refused to sign the separation agreement with Mr Hollande – 
insisting that she was prepared to forgive him and continue as First 
Lady, according to Elysee Palace aides.

‘This is the kind of problem which has held up a formal announcement of a separation,’ said one.

As
 the farce descended to new depths, senior journalists were briefed 
yesterday morning that Mr Hollande would announce his  separation from 
Ms Trierweiler ‘imminently’.

Leading
 newspaper websites and  satellite TV channels ran the news as their 
main item until about 2.30pm. It was then that an Elysee Palace 
spokesman backtracked and said: ‘There will be no announcement today. 
There are false rumours circulating in the French media.’

Then, shortly after 6pm, Mr Hollande finally put the separation statement out to French news agency AFP.

Ms
 Trierweiler is increasingly being viewed as a ‘loose cannon’ who may 
attempt to humiliate Mr Hollande for dumping her just  one-and-a-half 
years into his term of office.

Mr
 Hollande, who has never married, is now set to concentrate on his 
relationship with Ms Gayet. On January 10, photographs appeared in 
Closer magazine showing Hollande sneaking in and out of their Paris love
 nest, trying to disguise his identity with a crash helmet.

The
 notoriously volatile Ms Trierweiler, who is twice divorced, first flew 
into a rage and then checked herself into a Paris hospital for eight 
days, suffering from emotional shock.

She
 is said to have thrown valuable Elysee Palace property at Mr Hollande, 
although claims that she caused £2.5 million worth of damage to 
antiques, including a vase dating back to the reign of Louis XVI, have 
been denied.

The 
announcement came as a new opinion poll confirmed that Ms Trierweiler 
was by far the most unpopular First Lady in the recent history of 
France.

Just eight per cent
 of respondents to the survey for the Parisien newspaper backed Ms 
Trierweiler, a journalist for magazine Paris Match, as a popular First 
Lady.

After checking out of
 hospital, Ms Trierweiler raised eyebrows by moving into La Lanterne, 
one of the most luxurious presidential palaces in France, inviting her 
mother and other family members to stay with her.

Situated
 in Versailles, west of Paris, it comes complete with a heated swimming 
 pool and one of the best stocked wine cellars in  the country.

This
 caused huge embarrassment to Mr Hollande, a socialist who claims to 
‘dislike the rich’ but who has been blamed for his country’s spiralling 
unemployment rate and cost of living.

Up
 until today, Ms Trierweiler had been desperate to salvage her 
relationship with Mr Hollande, telling friends she ‘forgave him’ and 
wanted to get back to work.

She
 was particularly keen to accompany Mr Hollande on a trip to America in 
February, when the couple were due to stay with the Obamas at the White 
House.

Meanwhile, the 
delighted Ms Gayet is already said to have held a party for close 
friends and family to celebrate her  relationship with Mr Hollande being
 made public.

A photograph 
of the smiling actress, who has appeared in more than 50 French films, 
is splashed across the cover of the latest edition of Paris Match. In 
the picture, she is seen walking close to her parents’ country estate in
 south-west France.

The 
picture will infuriate her love rival – Ms Trierweiler has been a staff 
writer on Paris Match for more than 20 years, even holding on to  the 
job when she became First Lady in 2012.

Both
 women have used the media constantly to bolster their careers, and 
their strong links with France’s most intrusive popular magazines has 
been another cause of embarrassment for Mr Hollande.

Earlier this week, his advisers said he should remain a ‘bachelor president’ to avoid further scandal.

On Friday he went to visit the Pope in Rome, but refused to comment publicly about his colourful private life.

Ms Trierweiler’s trip to Mumbai was organised by French aid agency Action Against Hunger while she was still First Lady.

She
 will be accompanied by the actress Charlotte Valandrey. They are due to
 visit a slum and attend a gala charity dinner at the Taj Mahal Palace 
hotel on Sunday.

Many in 
France believe Ms Trierweiler is unwise to carry on with the visit, not 
just because she has just checked out of hospital, but because she no 
longer represents France on the world stage.
