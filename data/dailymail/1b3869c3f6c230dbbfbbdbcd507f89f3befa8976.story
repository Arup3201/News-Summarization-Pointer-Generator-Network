They are some of the most recognisable faces in the world.

But can you spot the celebrity behind the laughter lines and mass of grey hair?

These A-listers work hard at looking their best, employing nutritionists to craft calorie-counting diets and personal trainers to put them through grueling exercise regimes to try and stop the clock on the dreaded ageing process.

Image manipulation experts at Worth1000.com have given us a glimpse of how the years may treat Titanic star Leonardo DiCaprio, left. And right, how Miley Cyrus may look in years to come

Meanwhile some take more drastic measures, resorting to a little nip and tuck on the surgeon's table.

Image manipulation experts at Worth1000.com have peered into the future and given a glimpse of what the years may have in store for these well-known faces, fastocreate.com reported.

From Leondardo DiCaprio to Miley Cyrus, Megan Fox to Madonna the images were created for the website's 'Fountain Of Age' contest.

The images were created by the site's skilled photoshoppers, each taking a well-known face and adding laughter lines, furrowed brows, grey hair, crow's feet and sagging skin to create their entry.

The contest aims to test the users' Photoshop prowess. Past competitions have seen the experts turn stars into renaissance masterpieces, and leading men into leading ladies.

But for the latest batch of photos the future was the inspiration, and the results show the years may be kinder to some.
