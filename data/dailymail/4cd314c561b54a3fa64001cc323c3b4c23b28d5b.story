Edith Piaf tried to seduce French rocker Johnny Hallyday when he was a teenage star and she was in her forties, he has revealed.

Hallyday, 69, was terrified and 'ran away' from the legendary singer, he said in a book of interviews published yesterday.

'I was sitting beside her and, in the 
middle of the meal, I felt her hand climbing up my thigh,' recalled Hallyday, who was just 16 or 17 to her 44 years.

'I hesitated. Then I left and ran away from there. I ran away from Piaf.

'I was almost a virgin at the time. I couldn’t see myself in bed with her. As far as I was concerned, she was an old woman.'

Dans Mes Yeux (In My Eyes) - a book of interviews with novelist Amanda Sthers - does not say when the encounter happened.

However, it appears to have been 1960, the year Hallyday released his debut record after bursting on to the scene as the first successful French rock ’n’ roll performer.

His 17th birthday was in June, while Piaf would have been 44.

'Piaf used to come and see me singing every night,' he added, according to The Independent. 'I was flattered but never at ease with her.'

Hallyday is now a French icon, but at the time, he was being attacked in the national media as a corrupter of youth.

At the start of 1960, Piaf was the undisputed queen of 'la chanson française' but down on her luck after car crashes, drug abuse and failed love affairs. 

She made an impressive comeback that year with Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien, but died just two years later.

Piaf is known for preferring younger men but this is the first time that her attempt to seduce teenage Hallyday has been revealed.

In an interview with Le Parisien newspaper, Hallyday described the moment differently, calling it 'tender' and putting his reticence down to shyness.

'I was a minor at the time,' he said. 'I have never spoken about it before but it was rather a tender moment. I was sick with shyness and she overawed me. That’s why I ran away.'
