Tom Ince has told Gareth Southgate that he does not want to play for England Under 21s.

The 23-year-old – currently on loan at Derby County from Hull City - has 18 caps for the young Three Lions and has been a key part of the set-up under Southgate.

But Ince, after a discussion with dad Paul, has decided he no longer wants to be considered for selection, ruling him out of this summer’s European Championships in Czech Republic. 

Tom Ince has been left out of the latest England Under 21 squad by Gareth Southgate at his own request

Southgate said: ‘I have had discussions with Tom and his dad over the last week or so and he has decided he does not want to be considered for the Under 21s.

‘I have to say I was surprised. He has obviously been a regular for us all the way through the campaign. But he feels at this moment in time he has got some priorities at club level. There is some uncertainty about where he is going to be at club level next season.’

Ince has had a whirlwind year in club football, moving from Blackpool to Hull City in a deal that involved a drawn-out £2million compensation case between the two clubs.

It even looked like Ince could have moved abroad at one point with his father's former club Inter Milan said to have shown interest.

He has since been on loan at Nottingham Forest and Derby in the Championship. 

Southgate was told that Ince did not want to be selected and sought clarification from the player and his father

Southgate was speaking at Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium after announcing his squad for the forthcoming friendlies with Czech Republic and Germany.

He has, of course, lost Harry Kane to the senior squad, but hopes to have the Spurs striker available for the Euros.

‘Myself and Roy (Hodgson) are constantly talking about that and he’s made it clear we’re able to pick any players who are eligible,' he added.

‘One or two have been up to senior team but haven’t yet established themselves. It’s nice to have them back in the fold.

‘It’s great that Harry has gone up this time – it sends a message to the rest of the squad that the pathway is there.'
