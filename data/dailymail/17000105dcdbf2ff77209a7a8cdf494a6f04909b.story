Europe was last night poised to start printing billions of euros in a desperate bid to prop up the region’s moribund economy.

The European Central Bank is today expected to announce a programme of so-called quantitative easing as it steps up its fight against deflation and stagnation.

The bank is set to provide £40billion of newly-created cash every month for up to two years – potentially a total of almost £1trillion.

Europe was last night poised to start printing billions of euros in a desperate bid to prop up the region’s moribund economy; the European Central Bank is today expected to announce a programme of so-called quantitative easing as it steps up its fight against deflation and stagnation

The policy – which involves the ECB buying up government bonds across the 19 nations of the eurozone – is intended to lessen the pressure on banks and encourage them to lend more money.

It is hoped this will help households and businesses by making loans and mortgages cheaper. But critics of the policy say the banking system in Europe is so fragile that even with the huge injection of cash, banks will not feel secure enough to lend any more money.

They also fear that it will let irresponsible governments off the hook too easily – and could discourage them from taking the tough decisions needed to tackle the root of the problem.

The move, by ECB president Mario Draghi, will be closely watched in Britain as the eurozone is the UK’s largest trading partner. Just as the collapse of the single currency bloc could wreak havoc in the UK, a stronger and more prosperous neighbour could boost confidence on this side of the Channel and help exports.

George Osborne has warned that the UK is not ‘immune’ to the problems in the eurozone.

But critics fear the ECB’s plan is too little too late, and say it could tempt governments in the single currency bloc to renege on the reforms needed to boost growth and employment in the long-term.

Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, said: ‘If quantitative easing is successful and creates confidence then that is a good thing. The risk is that the political progress on reform gets put on the back burner. Then we get a lack of confidence.’

Axel Weber – chairman of financial services firm UBS and former head of Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank – said the ECB can only ‘buy time’ for the eurozone. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said that governments must take tough decisions to make the region more competitive.

He said that without such action ‘there will always be questions about the viability’ of the single currency.

It is a crucial week for the eurozone, with today’s landmark decision by the ECB to be followed on Sunday by elections in Greece that could see the radical Left-wing Syriza party seize power.

It is feared that Syriza’s attempts to renegotiate Greece’s bailout and tone down austerity will see the country leave the euro altogether – plunging the single currency bloc back into crisis.

Mr Draghi is expected to outline his plans to save the euro in Frankfurt today, following months of discussions amid stiff opposition to money-printing from Germany.

But, with prices across the eurozone falling 0.2 per cent in December, stoking fears of a prolonged period of deflation, Mr Draghi looks to have garnered enough support to act.

A prolonged period of deflation – such as suffered in Japan – can cripple economies as it makes debts harder to repay and can lead to businesses and households holding off spending. This then has a kock-on effect, hitting corporate profits, wages and jobs.

Mr Weber said the ECB risked making a mistake. ‘If the ECB continues to buy time and the time is not used then you have to ask whether doing more of the same is the right policy,’ he said. ‘Europe needs to continue to work at integration.

‘If that does not happen, the single currency area becomes an increasingly difficult project to run.’

He added: ‘However much [time] Mario Draghi decides to buy I don’t think you will see inflation for years.’
