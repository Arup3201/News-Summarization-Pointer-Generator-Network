Jennifer Benito-Kowalski traveled 9,000 miles from home to meet her son for the first time after hiring an Indian surrogate - a common practice for American women desperate to find a cost-effective way to have a baby.

After spending more than $30,000 on 20 unsuccessful rounds of intrauterine insemination, Jennifer and her husband Steve Kowalski turned to a well-known 'baby factory' in India.

The Kowalskis say it's a win-win formula - the gestational carrier gets paid more than she could earn in a lifetime, and the affluent couple gets a healthy baby with their own DNA.

However critics say the practice of 'human baby farming' is exploitative, turning vulnerable women, usually from developing countries, into 'ovens'.

For the Kowalskis, their son Kyle is a gift that could only be delivered through outsourcing.

The couple from San Carlos, in California, shared their story with the San Francisco Chronicle.

They said the Akanksha Infertility Clinic was a last resort after four years of failed IVF, fertility treatments and normal conception.

'Some people just get to have sex,' Steve, 41, said. 'It's not fair.'

In 2012, Jennifer, 40, began researching commercial surrogacy and found the financial and legal obstacles in the U.S. were extraordinary.

Only a handful of states had clear surrogacy laws, and the service could cost more than $150,000.

That's when she discovered the Indian treatment center whose head clinician, Dr Nayna Patel,  appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2007. The service would only cost $20,000.

'I feel like we're helping each other,' Jennifer said of the surrogate mother. 'I'll be eternally indebted to her for helping us with our family, and in turn, we're helping her.'

In late 2012, Dr Patel embedded two of their four embryos into Indian mother of two Manisha Parmar's uterus.

Although
Manisha, 29, and her husband Raman Parmar, 38, a flour mill worker, 
felt 'ashamed' at selling Manisha's body, the $7,500 payment would be 
life-changing.

Raman earns less than $50 a month.

'We feel a little ashamed about it,' Raman admitted. 'I had a lot of financial problems. I had to bring her here.'

Of India's 1.2 billion people, 70 percent live on less than $2 a day.

About 23 percent of its 587 million girls and women work, many toiling in low-paying, physically intensive jobs.

Surrogacy has become a viable money-maker for many Indian women - it is estimated to be a $2 billion industry. 

Akanksha is just one of India's 150 known fertility clinics, about 60 percent of which offer commercial surrogacy.

Other leading destinations for commercial surrogacy include Panama, Thailand and Ukraine.

Dr
Patel's clinic has more business than it can handle with more than 100 
pairs of aspiring parents on its surrogate waiting list. It began 
offering surrogacy services in 2004.

San Francisco Chronicle reported life for Manisha - and the other 80 surrogates at the clinic -  'was pleasant if monotonous' during their pregnancy.

Nurses kept close tabs on the women, who lived four to six to a room.

They had regular sleeping patterns, ate healthily, and took classes in trades when they weren't being injected with vitamins.

During their final trimesters, the women move from their dorms into the main clinic in the center of town.

Manisha eventually delivered Kyle by C-section, and although she wished to keep the baby, she knew that wasn't part of the contract.

Jennifer and Steve were overjoyed after nine months of waiting.

'We've been waiting so long,' Jennifer cried. 'Now we can say 'him' instead of 'it.' '

The couple spent 24 days in India after Kyle's birth dealing with red tape - passports, flights and other documentation.

While the wait was excruciating and the risks were high, the Kowalskis said their only regret was waiting so long before turning to a surrogate.

Manisha and her husband, meanwhile, had to live with the shame and family who disapproved of the process.
