Grief-stricken friends gathered at the tragic scene where a young woman died after tripping in front of a garbage truck.

Josie Edden fell over while she was crossing a road in Melbourne's central business district and was hit and killed by a garbage truck on Tuesday morning.

The 24-year-old was on her way to work, just two blocks from her apartment when she was struck at about 6.15am when walking across Collins Street near Southern Cross station.

Paramedics and a driver who witnessed the incident attended to the woman for around 15 minutes but she died at the scene.

Distraught friends and colleagues consoled one another at the scene after Ms Edden didn't turn up to work at the Code Black Coffee cafe.

Work mate, Rita Hanna, described how surreal it was to discover the moment that all of Ms Edden's colleagues at the cafe realised the tragic accident was their dear friend.

'The crazy thing is we all walked past the scene in the morning, we were all running to work, we were all late because there were no trams,' she told News Corp.

'We all got to work, we were all talking about it. Then we found out the person that had passed away was one of ours and that was devastating news.'

Sergeant Mark Rose said the truck driver, who is helping police with inquiries, would not have seen Ms Edden and did not appear to be at fault.

'It appears she was running, or walking very quickly ... has cut the corner against the flashing red man, tripped over, the truck's completed his turn, not seen her and ran her over,' he told reporters on Tuesday. 

Victoria Police acting chief commissioner Tim Cartwright said pedestrians, particularly in the city, are vulnerable which is why speed limits are lower.

'We know we have pedestrians, bike riders in the CBD who get injured,' he said.

'We know that every 10km off the speeds that we take off, that's a corresponding percentage who will survive collisions like this,' he said on ABC radio.
