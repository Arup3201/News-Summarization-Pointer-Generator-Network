This year’s Black Friday sales will have Walmart throwing open their doors earlier than ever before.

Opening at 8pm on Thanksgiving Day, two hours earlier than last year, the world’s largest retailer says they hope to relieve shoppers’ anxiety while also guaranteeing three of their most popular items for a special one hour.

If lined up inside the store between 10pm and 11pm on Thanksgiving day, those three items guaranteed are: an Apple iPad 2 with Wi-Fi for $399 plus a $74 Wal-Mart gift card; an Emerson 32-inch LCD TV for $148, down from the original $228; and an LG Blu-ray Disc player for $38, about half off the original price.

Early rush: Walmart plans to open their stores this Black Friday at 8pm this year, their earliest time yet

If those inside during that one-hour window find the product sold out, Wal-Mart will offer a guarantee card for the item.

Top items: Guaranteeing to have their top three items in stock, this iPad 2 with Wi-Fi is one of them with an expected sale price of $399 that includes a $74 Wal-Mart gift card

The item must be paid for by midnight and registered online. The product will then be shipped to the store where it was purchased for the customer to pick up before Dec. 25.

'We know it's frustrating for customers to shop on Black Friday and not get the items they want,' said Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer at Wal-Mart's U.S. division.

To satisfy customers' demands for coveted items, Wal-Mart 'bought very deep' on products that matter to its customers, he said.

Mr MacNaughton declined to offer 
details but he told reporters on Wednesday the discounter is offering 
sharper discounts and broader, deeper assortments for the kickoff and 
the rest of the season compared to years past. For example, Wal-Mart 
doubled the number of tablet computers it's bringing in for the winter 
holidays.

The 
stepped-up strategy comes as Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., is 
counting on keeping its momentum going at its U.S. business, which 
started roaring back late last year after struggling during a more than 
two-year slump.

It's critical for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for as much as 40 per cent of a retailer's annual sales.

Wal-Mart's strategy raises the competitive stakes for the start of the holiday season.

American retailers have increasingly 
expanded their hours on Black Friday to get ahead of the competition, 
but now the kickoff is creeping earlier into Thanksgiving Day.

Starting with the 8 pm sale on 
Thanksgiving, Wal-Mart will have two more rounds of sales that will also
include a consumer electronics sale two hours later and a sale at 5 am 
on Friday.

Last year, Target, Best Buy, Macy's and Kohl's were closed on Thanksgiving and kicked off Black Friday sales at the stroke of midnight, their earliest starts ever. Best Buy Co Inc, Macy's and Kohl's all plan to open at midnight again, while Target has not given its plans yet.

Outlook: Seen lined up outside a Walmart store on Black Friday in 2008, the store expects their one-hour guarantee of select items will alleviate some shoppers stress

Guaranteed: If those inside during their one-hour window find the product sold out, some shoppers seen waiting to enter the store in 2008, Wal-Mart says they will offer a guarantee card for the item

Sears Holdings Corp's (SHLD.O) Sears and Kmart stores will be open on Thanksgiving Day. Last year, Sears kept its discount chain Kmart open on Thanksgiving but the Sears chain was closed.

This year, Sears stores will open at 8 pm on Thanksgiving Day and stay open overnight until 10 pm on Black Friday. Kmart has been open on Thanksgiving for the last 21 years.

In 2011, Walmart began with deals on toys, home items and clothing at 10 pm on Thanksgiving, followed by electronics deals at midnight and other offers at 8 am on Friday, November 25.

Most Walmart stores will be open on Thanksgiving, unless they are required to close by local or state law.

Walmart has faced protests in various U.S. cities lately and some workers have planned to walk off the job on Black Friday. Such actions are being sponsored by groups including a contingent of workers called OUR Walmart that receives union support.
