An investor’s website has released its list of the worst companies to work for in America as identified by the employees who hate them.

24/7 Wall St. has sorted through the 250,000 companies measured by job review site Glassdoor.com.

Out of the most poorly rated, 24/7 Wall St. chose the nine publicly traded companies that scored the lowest and they’re mostly industries where customer interaction is key.

Mean: DISH was rated the worst in a survey of employee reviews on job advice website Glassdoor.com. The television provider was also rated 'Meanest Company in America' by Business Week

Meanwhile, three of the namesake Dillards under the company’s employ—Mike, William, and Alex—raked in a combined salary of $54 million over the last three years.

Discount retailer Dollar General came in just behind Dillard’s at number 4 on the list.

Investor website 24/7 Wall St. looked at job advice website Glassdoor.com's 250,000 reviewed employers and found the nine most poorly rated. Retailers make up four of the nine worst.

1. DISH

2. Express Scripts

3. Dillard's

4. Dollar General

5. RadioShack

6. ADT

7. Sears

8. NCR

9. Fiserv

The stores number a whopping 10,000 and employ 90,000-plus people, many of whom aren’t happy. Complaints often revolved around hours at America’s self-described ‘largest small-box retailer,’ especially for overworked store managers.

Theft, too, was a hot-button issue at Dollar General, though some said it is customer theft and others complained of abundant employee theft.

More service-based companies helped round out the list.

Employees at security company ADT complained that too much focus was placed on clinching a sale while higher-ups ‘could care less about customers after sale.’ This no doubt makes things difficult for service representatives who deal with customers in the thereafter, though with little help from a management team they often called ‘weak.’

This
was the Dish Network television provider’s second year as the dubious 
winner of 24/7 Wall St.’s list. Employees complained of low wages, 
strenuous hours, and unpleasant work conditions.

The company that received the poorest ratings: DISH.

The television provider, once called 'America's Meanest Comany' by Business Week, also proves that unhappy employees mean unhappy customers. The most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index ranked them behind competitors AT&T, Verizon, and DirecTV.

Of the eight other dreaded employers, four are in the retail sector.

'Treated like pawns': Retail companies made up much of the list from 24/7 Wall St. Dillard's Department Stores was the the lowest rated of the retail bunch

Dillard’s
Inc., Sears Holdings Corporation, Dollar General Corporation, and 
RadioShack Corp. all scored lower than 2.5 on Glassdoor.com’s 1-5 
ranking system.

The worst 
of the retail bunch, Dillard’s, came in at number 3 on the list. The 
company’s reviews bemoan its low wages and long hours.

‘The
benefits are pitiful and the salaries are not current with industry,’ 
wrote a reviewer. ‘I should know as I work in a [department] that sees 
the salaries.’

But for unhappy employees willing to make a change, there could be light at the end of the tunnel.

If they’re willing to leave the service and retail sector.

Another recent Glassdoor.com survey showed that the top 25 companies for ‘Work-Life balance’ are mostly in the technology field.
