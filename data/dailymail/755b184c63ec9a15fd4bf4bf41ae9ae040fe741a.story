Many people under emotional stress are reluctant to head to bed because they don't know, like Shakespeare's Hamlet, 'what dreams may come?'

Now scientists have found that dreaming - which is the Rapid Eye Movement phase of sleep - is actually essential to help us cope with inner turmoil.

Participants found it far easier to cope with emotional images once they had some sleep

Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, found our brains process emotional experiences during dreams and this takes the painful edge off difficult memories.

Study author Els van der Helm, said: 'During REM sleep, memories are being 
reactivated, put in perspective and connected and integrated, but in a 
state where stress neurochemicals are beneficially suppressed.'

The team studied 35 healthy young adults for their study, who were divided into two groups.

All of them viewed 150 emotional images, twice and 12 hours apart, while an MRI scanner measured their brain activity.

Half of the participants viewed the images in the morning and again in the evening, staying awake between the two viewings. The remaining half viewed the images in the evening and again the next morning after a full night of sleep.

Those who slept in between image viewings reported a significant decrease in their emotional reaction to the images.

MRI scans showed sleep caused a dramatic reduction in reactivity in the amygdala, a part of the brain that processes emotions. This allowed the brain's 'rational' prefrontal cortex to regain control of the participants' emotional reactions.

In addition, overnight recordings of the participant's electrical brain activity showed levels of stress neurochemicals reduced during sleep.

Co-author Professor Matthew Walker, 
said: 'The dream stage of sleep, based on its unique neurochemical 
composition, provides us with a form of overnight therapy, a soothing 
balm that removes the sharp edges from the prior day's emotional 
experiences.'

Did Hamlet have PTSD? The Shakespeare character, portrayed here by Michael Sheen, famously fears sleep. Scientists believe dreams help people to deal with emotional troubles, but could malfunction in those with post-traumatic stress

The findings, could explain why 
people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as war veterans,
 suffer reoccurring nightmares.

The researchers said the therapy element of sleep may malfunction in PTSD sufferers.
 Therefore when a flashback is triggered by, say, a car backfiring, they
 relive the whole experience because the emotion has not been properly 
stripped away from the memory during sleep.

While we spend one-third of our lives sleeping, there is no 
scientific consensus on the function of sleep.

These latest results, published in the journal Current Biology, offers some of the first 
insights into the emotional function of REM,
which typically takes up 20 per cent of a healthy human's sleeping hours.

Professor Walker said dreaming was vital in softening the emotional strength of experiences.

'We feel better about them, we feel we can cope,' he said.
