Scottish Football Association performance director Mark Wotte insists Ryan Gauld has no reason to worry - despite being demoted to Sporting Lisbon's B team.

The former Dundee United playmaker sealed a £3million move to the Portuguese giants earlier this summer.

But boss Marco Silva has sent the 21-year-old to play with the Lions' second string after admitting Gauld was struggling to adapt to life at his new club.

Wotte, though, insists the Scotland Under 21 star is in good hands.

Speaking at Heriott Watt University as the third intake of youngsters were welcomed into the Scottish Football Association's Performance Schools system, the Dutchman said: 'Playing for a club like Sporting Lisbon who have a history of creating world-class players is exciting for Ryan.

'He has been moved into their B squad but perhaps the B squad in Lisbon is better than the first-team squad at Dundee United.

'He will still be training with their A squad players on a daily basis and that will help him improve as well.

'I think it is a clever move from Sporting as it will make sure he can play a game every week and help him settle in.

'The rule in Portugal is that you can play for Sporting Lisbon A 72 hours after you have played for the B team.

'So there is nothing wrong with what they have done. They are very clever at talent management and they know what they are doing.

'There is definitely nothing for Ryan to worry about at this stage. He is just starting out over there. If he is still playing for Sporting Lisbon B in two years' time, then he should be worried.'
