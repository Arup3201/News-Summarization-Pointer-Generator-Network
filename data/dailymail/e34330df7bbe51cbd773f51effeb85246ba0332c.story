The hack attack against Sony Pictures may have been an inside job and not carried out by North Korea, cybersecurity experts have said.

Representatives from an independent cyber intelligence company briefed FBI agents yesterday on findings which indicate that disgruntled former Sony staff and piracy-advocates were behind the hack.

The FBI maintains that the hack was carried out by North Korea, but are now looking into the possibility that Pyongyang hired hackers from outside the
country, an official close to the investigation said on
Monday.

Not Pyongyang: FBI agents have been briefed  on findings which indicate that disgruntled former Sony staff and piracy-advocates were behind the hack in November this year

As North Korea lacks the capability to conduct some elements
of the sophisticated campaign by itself, the official said, U.S.
investigators are looking at the possibility that Pyongyang
'contracted out' some of the cyber work.

Some private security experts have begun to question whether
Pyongyang was behind the Sony cyberattack at all.

An investigation by cybersecurity firm Norse has found that it is likely a Sony insider might have helped launch the attack, the FBI was told during a briefing yesterday.

'We are very confident that this was not an attack master-minded by North Korea and that insiders were key to the implementation of one of the most devastating attacks in history,' Kurt Stammberger, a senior vice president with Norse, told CBS News last week.

Norse believes that a woman calling herself 'Lena', who claims to be part of the hacking group 'Guardians of Peace', may have worked for Sony for a decade before leaving last May.

Consulting firm Taia Global said the results
of a linguistic analysis of communications from the suspected
hackers suggest they were more likely from Russia than North
Korea. 

'I think the government acted prematurely in announcing
unequivocally that it was North Korea before the investigation
was complete,' said Mark Rasch, a former federal cybercrimes
prosecutor.

The FBI maintains that the Sony hack was carried out by Pyongyang over the release of The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un

'There are many theories about who did it and how
they did it. The government has to be pursuing all of them.'

While U.S. officials investigate whether North Korea
enlisted help from outside contractors, the FBI stood by its
previous statement that Pyongyang was the prime author of the
attack against the Sony Corp unit.

'The FBI has concluded the Government of North Korea is
responsible for the theft and destruction of data on the network
of Sony Pictures Entertainment,' the Federal Bureau of
Investigation said in a statement to Reuters.

North Korea has denied that it was behind the Sony attack
and has vowed to hit back against any U.S. retaliation.

The people who claimed responsibility for the hack have said
on Internet postings that they were incensed by the Sony
Pictures film 'The Interview,' a comedy about a fictional
assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Because of the hackers' threats, major U.S. cinema chains
refused to show the film. Last week, Sony struck deals with some
320 independent theaters to distribute 'The Interview' and also
made the film available online.  

The hackers released the email caches of Sony executives, including Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Amy Pascal and its CEO Michael Lynton

The FBI said its determination that North Korea was behind
the hack was based on information from a variety of sources,
including intelligence sources, the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, foreign partners and the private sector.

'There is no credible information to indicate that any other
individual is responsible for this cyber incident,' the agency
said.

Kevin Mandia, whose security firm was hired by Sony to
investigate the attack, said the only way to know who the
culprits are is to trace the network traffic from the infected
machines back to the hackers' machines. Only the government and
Internet service providers have that kind of visibility, he
added.

'I don't have the data that they have to come up with that
conclusion,' Mandia, chief operating officer of FireEye Inc, said.

'Every attack loops through numerous machines,' he said.
'You have to peel that onion all the way back. It isn't an easy
thing to do.'

Mandia, who has supervised investigations into some of the
world's biggest cyberattacks, said the Sony case was
unprecedented.

'Nobody expected when somebody breaks in to absolutely
destroy all your data, or try to anyway, and that's just
something that no one else has seen,' he said.
