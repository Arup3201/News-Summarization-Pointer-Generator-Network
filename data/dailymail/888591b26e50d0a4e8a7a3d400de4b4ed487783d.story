Sunday's Super Bowl was a tense match - and Crusoe the dachshund was driven to distraction as he watched his team get crushed in the final few minutes.

Ryan Beauchesne, 26, from Ottawa, Canada, filmed his sport-loving pup yelping out and pacing to and fro as he saw the Seattle Seahawks miss out on victory against the New England Patriots.

As he sees the final 24-28 score, Crusoe lets out a defeated bark while plunging his head into a bucket of popcorn in a bid to console himself.

Getting into the spirit of things, Crusoe donned a headpiece shaped like a giant foam finger with the '#1' printed on it.

He watched the game at home from the comfort of the couch, with some sporting snacks within paw's reach.

The 2015 Super Bowl was pegged as one of  the more exciting matches in recent memory. 

Both teams held the lead at different points during the game, but a clutch interception by Malcolm Butler assured the Patriots another Super Bowl win.

It was the Patriots fourth win since 2001. 

Many fans of Crusoe the dog deemed his football-viewing antics 'cute' and 'adorable'.

Beauchesne, a web developer, and his girlfriend Laurence Dionne started creating handmade costumes for Crusoe several years ago. 

The canine has since scored a burgeoning online following with more than 17,000 Instagram followers and two million YouTube hits.

He has previously dressed up in a scuba diving suit, a chef's outfit, a Batman suit, and a Wile E Coyote costume, complete with a rocket.
