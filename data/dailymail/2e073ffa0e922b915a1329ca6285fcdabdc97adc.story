Offended: Howard Blake was told to send a demo when he offered to help on the sequel to The Snowman

As the man behind the haunting theme to The Snowman, Howard Blake thought he was well qualified to help out on the sequel.

After all, his original score – Walking In The Air – has sold over a million copies and has become synonymous with Christmas.

The composer, however, found his pride well and truly dented when he offered his services and was told to submit a demo tape for consideration.

Yesterday Mr Blake said the only song he had so far heard from the sequel, The Snowman and The Snowdog, sounded like ‘X Factor style pop’ which he feared would upset fans of the first film. 

He said: ‘There are some people who watch The Snowman every year with their whole family, so to them it is something almost sacred.

'It’s an icon that is part of the entire English Christmas. It really holds a very dear place in people’s hearts.’

He’s particularly upset the follow up does not feature the original theme.

He said: ‘I don’t think it can be a proper sequel without some version of Walking in the Air.

It could be sung by a different voice, it could be updated. But it’s so much part of The Snowman that people will be expecting it.’

Mr Blake, 74, wrote Walking in the Air in 1970 on a beach in Cornwall after escaping from London where the pressures of a massive workload had driven him to a near breakdown.

It wasn’t until over a decade later when he was shown plans for the film of The Snowman that he realised he had the perfect musical accompaniment.

In the 1982 film, based on the book by Raymond Briggs, the song plays as the boy and snowman glide over the countryside.

Follow-up: A scene from The Snowman and The Snowdog. Mr Blake said it would not be a proper sequel unless it had some version of Walking in the Air in it

In the sequel, the snowdog joins them as they fly across London before heading for the North Pole, over a new soundtrack written and recorded by former Razorlight drummer Andy Burrows and British composer Ilan Eshkeri.

Mr Blake, who first made his name in the sixties writing scores for TV shows, said that after being belatedly told about the new film his assistant approached the show’s producer, Camilla Deakin, to ask if she wanted him to write any music for it.

He added: ‘She said if you care to submit a demo, we’re asking anyone who can write music to send in demos for our consideration. It’s unbelievable.

Fears: Mr Blake that the only song he had heard from the sequel sounded like X Factor style pop

Original: Walking in the Air which featured in The Snowman (pictured) was originally sung by St Paul's choirboy Peter Auty

‘I wrote a polite letter saying I don’t do demos but if you would like me to come and look at the script you are proposing I could let you know if I might be interested in composing a score for it.

I never had a reply. That is extremely offensive.’ Walking in the Air was originally sung by St Paul’s choirboy Peter Auty.

A version sung by Welsh chorister Aled Jones released three years later reached Number 5 in the charts.

The new film will air on Channel 4 over Christmas. A spokesman for the broadcaster said: ‘The Snowman and The Snowdog is a brand new sequel with an original storyline and new soundtrack. 

‘John Coates, who died earlier this year, produced the original film and was instrumental in getting Raymond Briggs’ blessing and bringing The Snowman and The Snowdog to screen.’
