Facebook is banned in China, so it's likely that the authorities there won't particularly 'like' a portrait of the social media network's CEO that's made up of thousands of images of Chinese people.

The striking portrait is one of 67 of the Facebook founder that are currently hanging in a Singapore art gallery.

Called ‘The Face of Facebook’, the installation features artworks ranging from oil paintings to digital prints that are based on a portrait of Mr Zuckerberg that appeared in the 20 September issue of the New Yorker.

Face-inating: This portrait of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the ShanghART gallery is itself made up of tiny portraits of Chinese people

The exhibition has been has been curated by Chinese artist Zhu Jia

The exhibition, at the ShanghART gallery, has been curated by Chinese artist Zhu Jia – and the portraits were made by more than 50 of his friends.

Contributors include Liu Xiaodong, Wang Guangyi, Yan Peiming, Zhang Xiaogang, video artist Yang Fudong and upcoming artist Sun Xun.

None of the works have signatures on them, so visitors are left to guess who made what.

The portraits are based on a photograph of Zuckerberg that appeared in a September 2010 edition of the New Yorker

Frame game: A visitor looks at the portraits, which number 67 and will be sold as a single artwork

According to local media, they will be sold as a single work for $700,000 (£435,000).

Mr Jia’s artwork generally examines political, economic and social change in China.

The Facebook exhibition runs from October 23 to December 9.
