Baltimore Ravens star running back Ray Rice was arrested over the weekend for getting into a physical fight with his fiancee at an Atlantic City casino.

Rice's attorney confirmed the arrest, telling the Baltimore Sun it was over a 'very minor physical altercation' and that Rice's fiancee was also charged and arrested.

Police have not identified Rice's 
fiancee, but he has been dating Palmer since 2008. Together they have a 
daughter, 2-year-old Rayven.

Stand-out: Rice has been a star player for the Ravens ever since he was drafted in the second round of the 2008 draft. Prior to that, he played for Rutgers University

A spokesman for the Ravens issued a statement following the weekend arrest.

'We are aware of the Friday night situation with Ray Rice and his fiancee. We have spoken with Ray, and know that they returned home together after being detained.'

Philadelphia-based attorney Michael Diamondstein has been hired to represent Rice.

'We haven’t seen any charging documents yet,' Diamondstein said. 'There was an argument that included Ray. I can’t give any specifics because we haven’t seen the document yet.'

'Once we’re able to go through the evidence, it should wind up to be little more than a misunderstanding,' Diamondstein said.

Rice has been a stand-out player for the Ravens ever since he was drafted to the Maryland team from Rutgers University in the second round of the 2008 draft.

He helped bring the team a Super Bowl victory in 2013, and his daughter came out on the field after the victory to celebrate with dad.
