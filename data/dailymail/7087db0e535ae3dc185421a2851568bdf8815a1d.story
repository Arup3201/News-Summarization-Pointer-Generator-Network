Argentine goalkeeper Agustin Orion was struck in the head by a rock during Boca Juniors' Copa Sudamericana clash with Rosario Central.

The Boca goalkeeper was seen bleeding from a cut sustained when the rock thrown from the home fans hit him, as an intense atmostphere turned nasty during the second-round match.

At first Orion seemed remarkably unperturbed by the incident, strolling across to receive medical attention, but as the blood started to flow he was treated lying down on the pitch.

Bloodied: The Boca Juniors goalkeeper sustained a cut by his right eye from the rock

Treatment: Orion was treated on the pitch but decided he was fit to play on in the 1-1 draw

However, the keeper was able to continue after the treatment and went on to complete the game.

Ten-man Rosario Central equalised in the fifth minute of stoppage time to secure a draw in the first leg of the tie, but the match was overshadowed by the ugly incident. 

Earlier the Rosario Central fans had welcomed their team out onto the pitch with a dramatic display of flag-waving and flares.
