It has been touted as the future of computing, the next revolution in technology, and also been barred from many establishments before it even goes on sale.

However, until now, it has not been clear exactly how Google Glass, the search giant's eyewear, actually works.

Luckily, a designer has taken it upon himself to create an infographic showing exactly how Google manages to project an image into a user's view.

How Glass works: A German designer created this infographic to show how the eyewear projects an image

The infographic also reveals how Glass is focused so the image always appears sharp

'Depending on how you wear the Google Glass, the layer appears in the 
upper right corner or in the middle of the visual field,' says Missfeldt.

'When the Google
 Glass is high on the nose, so that you can practically see through 
underneath, you must turn the eye up to view the image sharp.

'Because 
the prism is semi-transparent you can also place it directly in front of
 the pupil. In that case, you have the sharp layer directly in front of 
the eyes.'

Martin Missfeldt, a German designer, said he created the graphic to show people how the Google system works.

'Google Glass is a technical masterpiece,' he said.

'It combines numerous functions and features in a very small unit. In addition to phone and camera (photo, video), it offers Internet connection, including GPS.'

Glass is set to go on sale later this year, although will initially be limited to developers and selected members of the public.

It is expected to cost under Â£1,000 when it becomes widely available.

'The core feature of Google Glass is a visual layer that is placed over the reality ('augmented reality'), explains Missfeldt

'This layer opens a door to amazing new possibilities.

'In the Google Glass contains a mini-projector, which projected the layer via a clever, semi-transparent prism directly on the retina in the eye.

'Because of this the image, even though it is so close to the eye, is sharp and clear.

'You can move the front part of the Google Glass easily to optimize the focus.'

Google has so far only released limited video footage of how Glass will actually look

Wearing glasses and using glass could be impossible, warns Missfeldt

Missfeldt also warns those wearing glasses with prescription lenses may struggle.

'The biggest challenge for Google will now
 be to make the Google Glass also usable for people with normal glasses 
(to compensate for a low vision).

'In this case the Google Glass has to 
be placed ahead of normal glasses - which doesn't look and feel well or 
like a glass.

'Or Google has to manufacture individual customized prisms, 
but this would be considerably more expensive than the standard 
production.

It comes as it emerged people wearing 
Google Glass eyewear could be banned from strip clubs, cinemas and 
casinos because their owners donâ€™t want them filming there.

Bosses
 for establishments in the US said that due to privacy concerns they 
would be asking anyone wearing the glasses to remove them or they wonâ€™t 
be let in.

Lap dance clubs 
said that they would treat Google Glass wearers the same as anyone 
caught filming a stripper - and would kick them out.

American technology guru Brian Fung predicts wearable devices like Google Glass (pictured) will be expensive as the hardware will probably not be subsidised by phone companies and consumers will have to upgrade their data plans

t is believed Google Glass (pictured) will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity but it could also spark an increase in the cost of data plans - possibly for all consumers even if they are not taking advantage of the new technology
