For several years, a £500,000 painting by an acclaimed artist had pride of place in the home of one of Britain’s richest residents.

Aline Foriel-Destezet, 73, wife of the billionaire founder of Adecco, the world’s largest recruitment business, displayed the oil on canvas La Ciotat, 1907 in the hall of her London home.

After all, it was purportedly signed by French painter Emile-Othon Friesz and was purchased from a company run by respected fine art dealer, Simon Dickinson.

So you can imagine Mme Foriel-Destezet’s shock when one of Mr Dickinson’s staff contacted her to say the picture she bought in good faith for 670,000 euros in 2007 - £525,000 at current rates - was the work of one of the world’s most notorious art forgers, German Wolfgang Beltracchi.

The French-born philanthropist was outraged when Mr Dickinson’s aide then informed her that the case fell outside the statute of limitations and therefore his company had ‘no liability’ towards her, though they had a desire to ‘act honourably and look to reach an equitable conclusion’.

No such settlement has been agreed, with Mme Foriel-Destezet - a keen supporter of the Royal Opera House - ‘very distressed’ that she has not been offered a full refund.

She has instructed top City law firm Withers to represent her in her legal battle with Jermyn Street dealer Mr Dickinson.

The saga started in March 2007 when Mme Foriel-Destezet, a collector of mainly 19th century art, bought ‘La Ciotat, 1907’ purportedly by Emile-Othon Friesz, and signed and dated ‘Othon Friesz 1907’.

The painting was acquired for a purchase price of €670,000 at the world famous Maastricht art fair from the US trading arm of Simon C Dickinson Limited, known as Dickinson Roundell.

In May 2013, Simon C Dickinson Limited, through their German office in Berlin, wrote to Mme Foriel-Destezet saying that the painting would have to be shipped to Germany to be checked by a laboratory which had carried out chemical tests on other paintings thought to be the work of master forger Beltracchi.

The crook was jailed for six years in 2011 after being found guilty of counterfeiting 14 pictures as part of an elaborate and skilful scam that netted him and his gang £14million. In 2012, he sensationally admitted he may have placed as many as 2,000 bogus pictures by 50 different artists on the market.

One such picture, was ‘La Ciotat, 1907’ - the one purchased by Mme Foriel-Destezet.

In September 2013, Mr Dickinson’s German office suggested in an email to her that – following chemical analysis of the painting - she had bought a fake.

The email went on to say: ‘The findings indicate that titanium white was used in a number of instances, making it impossible for the painting to have been painted before 1938 (the titanium white used in the painting was sourced from rutile, a method that was patented by W.J. Kroll in 1938; before that date titanium white in its pure form was only available from 1910 onwards, so either way, the presence of titanium white is a sign that the painting cannot pre-date 1910). This strongly suggested that the painting we have analysed is indeed a forgery and most probably comes from the workshop of Mr Beltracchi’.

The following month Emma Ward, managing director of Simon C Dickinson Limited, wrote to her to say that as the case fell outside the statute of limitations, Dickinson Roundell Inc. had ‘no liability’ though they had a desire to ‘act honourably and look to reach an equitable conclusion’.

According to lawyers representing Mme Foriel-Destezet, Mr Dickinson’s firm have made it clear that they do not agree to her request for full reimbursement plus her legal costs.

A friend said: ‘Aline was very distressed and shocked to find out it was a fake and she expected that Simon Dickinson would reimburse her in full, as the painting is not what he purported to sell her – it is in fact a forgery. Aline feels it is morally incorrect for him not to return the money in full.

‘He is a well-known dealer with a long career who surely should have done his due-diligence considerably better than he has as the painting has proven to be a forgery.’

Added the friend: ‘Mme Foriel-Destezet has been put in the extraordinary position of effectively being asked to ‘bid’ against herself. Dickinson have refused to say what they would be willing to offer her and instead have asked her to put forward a figure herself - but less than the reimbursement of the purchase price plus her costs.’

A spokesman for Dickinson Roundell said: ‘The context to this matter is that the main international auction houses and many other leading dealers were duped by this wide-reaching and sophisticated forgery ring.

‘At the outset Dickinson Roundell in New York obtained confirmation from the worldwide Friesz expert, Odile Aittouares (the author of the catalogue raisonné of the artist), that the painting was genuine. Upon suspecting that this painting might possibly not be genuine, they approached Mme Foriel-Destezet suggesting they investigate the matter on her behalf.

‘Once it was confirmed by scientific analysis that the painting was a forgery, in a desire to act honourably despite the matter being outside the statute of limitations, they suggested over 14 months ago that they should meet to discuss how the position might be ameliorated, but were rebuffed. The matter has since been the subject of correspondence between the lawyers of the two parties.’

Four years ago the Mail revealed that Old Masters expert Dickinson was at the centre of a legal wrangle concerning the commission on a £4.2 million Leonardo da Vinci sketch. The case was finally resolved after a flurry of writs and years of litigation.
