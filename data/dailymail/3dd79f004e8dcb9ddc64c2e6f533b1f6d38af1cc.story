There’s no place like home, as Alan Pardew will testify. It’s two games, two wins for Crystal Palace’s new manager and his decision to quit Newcastle and return to the club where he spent five years as a player is looking an astute one.

Having secured Palace’s first win in nine matches in beating Dover, he maintained his 100 per cent start to life at Selhurst Park with this victory over Tottenham.

Having fallen behind to Harry Kane’s strike, Palace turned the game around. If Pardew’s Eagles aren’t quite soaring, their wings are finally flapping. And that is more than could be said for the side under former boss Neil Warnock.

Alan Pardew has won 13 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League boss.

There is an inescapable sense that these players want to perform for their manager — to give him the homecoming he dreamed about.

We won’t see the fruits of Pardew’s work on the training field for a few weeks, though keeping possession seems to be a key objective. Pardew said following the FA Cup win at Dover that his side would be taking risks on the ball. That was certainly the case on Saturday.

One passage of play in the 14th minute, which saw Palace’s defenders pass their way out of trouble, drew applause from the supporters.

Players were often satisfied just to clear their lines under Warnock. If Saturday is anything to go by, those days are gone.

The reintroduction of Barry Bannan is an indication of the passing style Pardew wants to implement.

The Scot was a peripheral figure under Warnock and Tony Pulis but has started both games under Pardew. Bannan isn’t one to hoof the ball — he saw plenty of possession before being subbed at half-time having picked up a yellow card.

Bringing back Bannan suggests Palace will play with a technically gifted midfield pivot. Whether Bannan is that man long-term remains to be seen. He needs to cool his temper first.

A clearer idea of how Bannan fits into Pardew’s plans will emerge once captain Mile Jedinak is back from Asia Cup duty with Australia. Indeed, the pending returns of Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie, who is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Congo, will provide Pardew with a massive boost in the coming weeks.

Bolasie, in particular, will add a fresh attacking dimension — not that Palace looked short of ideas against Tottenham. There was a tendency under Warnock to overuse the flanks, relying on the pace of Bolasie, Wilfried Zaha, Jason Puncheon and Dwight Gayle to get in behind the opposition.

That remained a fruitful avenue on Saturday as second-half goal-scorers Puncheon and Gayle caused a host of problems.

Likewise, Zaha’s blistering 20-minute cameo will raise hope the forward, on loan from Manchester United, can recapture the form that made him the most sought after youngster in the country two years ago.

Pardew, though, is determined to strengthen his squad. Palace have been rebuffed in a loan move for Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert, though the club may revisit that deal later in the window.

Bafetimbi Gomis of Swansea is in the frame, but Jermain Defoe is likely to be out of Palace’s price range. Arsenal’s Yaya Sanogo is expected to arrive this week.

Pardew said: ‘This result doesn’t change my mind about the transfer window. We still need one or two. That is progressing well and we hope to have some news this week.

‘I had a chat with Brendan Rodgers but Rickie isn’t going anywhere. I know Jermain from my West Ham days and I know what he can do.’
