City fat cats have seen their wages soar to 180 times that of an average worker, a new report revealed today.

On average the bosses of Britain's 100 biggest companies took home £4.7million last year - up from £4.1million the year before, according to the High Pay Centre. Ordinary workers, meanwhile, earned £26,884.

The gap between bosses and workers has soared over the past 20 years - from just 60 times the average wage in the 1990s.

The High Pay Centre today urged to take 'radical action' to close the gap, such as requiring firms to cap executive pay at a fixed multiple of their lowest paid employees.

It said shareholders were still signing off soaring executive pay despite being given the power to vote them down at annual meetings.

The think tank said trust in business was being damaged by the perception that an executive 'elite' were reaping all the rewards from economic growth.

High Pay Centre director Deborah Hargreaves said: 'It's time to get serious about tackling the executive pay racket. The Government's tinkering won't bring about a proper change in the UK's pay culture.

'We need to build an economy where people are paid fair and sensible amounts of money for the work that they do and the incomes of the super-rich aren't racing away from everybody else.

'A maximum pay ratio would recognise the important principle that all workers should share in a company's success and that gaps between those at the top and low and middle earners cannot just get wider and wider.'

While FTSE chiefs take home millions each year, ordinary families are sinking into debt. A report last week revealed how Southampton, Peterborough and Newcastle were the most indebted places in the country

A Business Department spokesman said: 'The Government has introduced comprehensive reforms to give shareholders more powers in order to restore the link between top pay and performance, which in recent years has become excessive and increasingly disconnected.

'We've seen chief executive pay increase substantially over the past three decades, with CEOs earning 139 times the average employee in 2011, up from 47 in 1998. It's only in the last few years that we're beginning to see more restraint applied.'
