The son of Neil Kinnock plans to stand for Parliament as a Labour MP, it emerged yesterday.

Stephen Kinnock, 44, becomes the last member of his family to enter politics after being shortlisted for Aberavon.

The father of two is married to Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt – who took the notorious ‘selfie’ with David Cameron and Barack Obama at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service.

Unusual: Stephen Kinnock hopes to stand for election in the UK, while his wife Helle Thorning-Schmidt is still Prime Minister of Denmark, something she has as admitted is 'unusual'

Dynasty: Mr Kinnock hopes to follow in the footsteps of his father Neil, who led Labour from 1983 to 1994. Pictured in 1992 are (left to right) Stephen Kinnock, his mother Glenys, sister Rachel and father Neil

In what she has admitted is an 
‘unusual’ move, the couple plan to pursue separate political careers in 
their home countries. Mr Kinnock, who has been based in London since 
2012, faced controversy in Denmark – where he was embroiled in a tax 
scandal and the couple were forced to deny ‘grotesque’ rumours that he 
was gay.

Speaking of his 
decision to enter British politics, Mr Kinnock told BBC Radio Wales: ‘I 
have been a member of the Labour party since I was 15 years old, and of 
course politics is in my blood.

‘But it was always important for me to build my own career before making the decision to stand.’

Mr
 Kinnock’s father Neil was Labour leader between 1983 and 1992 before 
becoming a European Commissioner. His mother Glenys was a Labour MEP 
before she took a life peerage and a job as Europe Minister under Gordon
 Brown. Both now sit in the Lords.

Sister
 Rachel was a research assistant for her mother in Brussels before 
serving Gordon Brown and is now a member of Ed Miliband’s inner circle.

Mr
 Kinnock, who works for business advisory company Xyntéo, is now hoping 
to take a Welsh seat that Labour has held since 1922 as one of Labour’s 
‘Red Princes’.

He joins a list of other politicians’ sons hoping to 
become MPs, with Jack Straw’s son Will already securing a seat and David
 Prescott and Euan Blair both on the lookout.

Tory
 MP Philip Davies last night mocked the way Labour officials have 
cleared the way for Stephen Kinnock, adding: ‘I just hope that he’s not 
as much of a windbag as his father.’

Labour has agreed that Aberavon should be one of two seats where men are allowed on the candidate shortlist in Wales.

He must now make his pitch to the constituency in the hope of being selected to stand in the 2015 general election.

Labour has a majority of ore than 11,000 in the seat, vacated by Hywel Francis who is standing down.

While Mr Kinnock hopes to enter the Commons in 2015, his wife Helle Thorning-Schmidt is not planning to quit as Danish PM.

Smiles: Miss Thorning Schmid made headlines around the world last month after poising for a selfie with British PM David Cameron and US President Barack Obama

If Stephen Kinnock makes it to the Commons he will join a growing list Labour figures following in the footsteps of family members who defined the party for a generation.

Will Straw, son of former Home Secretary Jack, has been selected to contest the seat of Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire.

David Prescott, son of former Deputy Prime Minister John, missed out on becoming the candidate for the seat of Greenwich but was has not given up hope of finding a berth.

Euan Blair, son of former PM Tony, reportedly has his eye on finding a seat, but after being linked with Coventry North West, incumbent Geoffrey Robinson was reselected.

Jo Dromey, son of Labour MPs Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey, has denied being on the look out for a seat but many in the party expect him to stand.

Emily Benn, granddaughter of Tony and niece of Hillary, stood in the 2010 general election anbd could do so again.

She made headlines around the world last month when she was seen posing for a selfie with David Cameron and US President Barack Obama during Nelson Mandela’s memorial service in South Africa.

She has admitted the plan for her husband to seek election 700 miles from her home in Copenhagen is ‘unusual’.

She told journalists last month: ‘We have lived an unusual life in many ways and we always make it work. I’m absolutely convinced we will make this work as well.

‘So to all of you who are worried about the way we will make it work in our private household, don’t worry too much.’

The couple have two daughters. She was elected as Prime Minister in 2011 and a year later Mr Kinnock moved to base himself in London.

After leaving university in 1992 – the year his father lost the crunch election to John Major’s beleaguered Tory party – Mr Kinnock worked in Brussels, Russia, Africa and Switzerland.

In the run-up to a Danish general election a scandal erupted over claims Mr Kinnock was paying tax in Switzerland and not Denmark. He was cleared by an official report later but he did not meet residency rules because he spent so long out of the country.

The couple later gave an interview denying rumours he was gay with Miss Thorning-Schmidt saying the claims were ‘grotesque’.
