Gay men in relationships could be able to give blood for the first time since the Aids epidemic of the eighties under a shake-up of medical laws being proposed by ministers.

The move to allow homosexual men will mark a significant change to current rules which prevent gay men from giving blood unless they have been celibate for a year.

This rule was put in place because gay men are more statistically likely to have hepatitis B and HIV.

However, campaigners suggest that this is illogical as many gay men who lead promiscuous lifestyles are still able to donate without being tested.

Michael Fabricant, MP for Lichfield is now pushing for a reform of the law, especially in light of the growing acceptance of same-sex marriages.

Ministers from the Department of Health plan to look into the possibility of changing the law to allow gay men more leniency when giving blood.

Jane Ellison, minister for public health has also asked for a review into whether it is possible for gay men who have been tested for sexually transmitted diseases to donate blood.

In 2011, a blanket ban on gay men donating blood was scrapped.

Mr Fabricant said: 'I, of course recognise the absolute requirement for gay men giving blood to be safe and free from infection. 

'But there is a growing shortage of blood donors and a fundamental unfairness needs to be addressed.'
