These dramatic pictures show the aftermath of a brazen robbery in which the offenders used a stolen digger to smash their way into a Marks & Spencer store before stealing the cash machine.

The thieves left a trail of destruction after removing the ATM from inside the store during the raid at Malvern Retail Park in Worcestershire.

They ploughed the stolen JCB-style digger into the building - just yards from the front doors of the store – in the early hours of this morning.

The thieves used the mechanical arm of the digger to remove the ATM from the wall, leaving only rubble behind

They then made their escape in a second vehicle after ripping the cash machine from the wall using the mechanical arms of the digger to tear it free.

West Mercia Police said officers had arrested one man on suspicion of theft following the raid but confirmed the force was still hunting other members of the gang.

A force spokesman said: 'Officers were called at around 2am to reports of a break in at a Marks & Spencer store in Malvern.

'We believe they struck between 1.50am and 2.01am and they escaped with an ATM cash machine.

'The digger involved was reported stolen from Madresfield in Worcestershire between 4pm on Monday and 2am on Tuesday.

'One man has been arrested on suspicion of theft but we believe others are involved.

'We are appealing for anybody who witnessed anything or saw any suspicious vehicles in the area to get in touch with us.'

The dramatic pictures taken at the scene this morning show a gaping hole in the front wall and the red digger still parked in front of the shop but sealed off with police tape.

Residents and workers from Malvern Retail Park expressed their shock at the raid in the market town.

An Argos employee, who did not wish to be named, said: 'When we got here this morning police were everywhere.

'It takes some audacity to smash your way into a massive store like that and steal a cash machine.

'It's like something from a Hollywood movie.'

Tina Katarro, 33, who lives nearby, said: 'I heard a noise in the middle of the night like a dull rumbling sound but I thought nothing of it until I heard sirens soon after.

'This is a nice quiet rural town and nothing like this happens here, we are all very shocked.'

Marks & Spencer customer Ian Yates, 77, added: 'I come to the cafe each day for a nice muffin and I couldn't believe my eyes when I arrived and saw a huge hole in the wall.'
