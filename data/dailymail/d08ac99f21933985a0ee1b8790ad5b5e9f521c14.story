This flow chart reveals the tortuous web of cash transactions made by DJ Chris Moyles in a bid to avoid paying £1million in tax.

It shows how the Radio 1 Breakfast Show DJ moved his earnings around a string of banks and charitable trusts to claim that he had incurred huge losses as a second-hand car dealer.

Many of the organisations involved in the scheme are based in low-tax and highly private jurisdictions such as Jersey, the Channel Islands and the British Virgin Islands.

Head scratcher: This flow chart shows how tax advisers working on behalf of Chris Moyles advised him to make a complicated series of international transactions in a bid to avoid paying £1million in tax

But Moyles now faces a whopping bill 
after a tax judge said he did not believe the former Radio 1 star had 
been buying and selling used cars.

He
 had been using a scheme dubbed 'Working Wheels', promoted by a firm 
called NT Advisers, which advised their high-earning clients to claim 
they suffered business losses which could be claimed against their tax 
bill.

Variants of the 
scheme, which was used by about 450 clients of the firm, included 
claiming losses from dealing in other high-value items such as watches or cash
 receivables.

A spokesman 
for HMRC told MailOnline: 'The scheme is highly artificial and relies on
 complex rules concerning overseas dividends, which provide for relief 
on payments which are representative of dividends paid on shares which 
are loaned to other persons.'

Chris Moyles is thought to have earned around £700,000 a year from his time presenting the BBC Radio 1 breakfast show, which he tried to offset using a tax avoidance scheme popular with high earners

A tax tribunal concluded: 'A realistic
 view of the facts shows that the aim was that the appellants, "as 
though by magic", should appear to have incurred vast fees in order to 
borrow modest amounts of money they did not need in order to invest it 
in a "trade" they had no desire to pursue.'

Last night Moyles publicly admitted his ‘mistake’ and said he had ‘learnt a valuable lesson’.

But he has fought hard to hush up his use of tax avoidance schemes.

When
 it emerged in 2012 he had used the same legal offshore scheme as 
comedian Jimmy Carr, who was paying as little as 1 per cent, Moyles 
claimed it would breach his human rights if he could not keep his 
membership secret.

Separately,
 Moyles, 39, was one of 450 celebrities, fund managers and other top 
earners to try to avoid tax by taking part in a scheme called ‘Working 
Wheels’.

It worked by 
allowing members to say they had incurred huge fees while working in the
 second-hand car trade, which they could claim back against their tax 
bill.

On the self-assessment
 tax return he filed for the financial year ending in April 2008, when 
he was presenting the BBC Radio 1 show, he claimed he ‘had engaged in 
self-employment as a used-car trader’.

He claimed he had made a loss of £1million, but the tax tribunal ruled this was just a ruse to save tax.

The working wheels scheme is reportedly popular with the rich of Britain, as it allows people to claim a significant amount of money back off of large earnings

It found that, far from being a car dealer, Moyles had never supplied any vehicles and had ‘no interest’ in doing so.

Nor did he have the faintest idea how 
much the cars he was supposedly trading cost to buy and to sell.

When HM
 Revenue and Customs rejected the scheme, Moyles and two other members 
appealed to a tax court.

Yesterday,
 tax judge Colin Bishopp rejected the appeal, saying it was clear he 
‘entered the scheme for no purpose other than to achieve a tax saving’.

He said the ‘scale of Mr Moyles’ borrowing was driven solely by the 
amount of the tax loss he wanted to achieve, in his case £1million.

The
 ruling said Moyles was ‘anxious to be reassured the scheme was lawful, 
and that he would not have to undertake any trading himself’.

Moyles 
later took to Twitter to say: ‘Upon advice, I signed up to a scheme 
which I was assured was legal. My knowledge of the dealings of the 
scheme were naive. I’m not a tax expert and acted on advice. This was a 
mistake and I accept the ruling without reservation.’

The
 'Working wheels' tax avoidance scheme, popular with Britain's high 
earners who want to avoid paying their full tax, involves posing as a 
used car salesman on you tax return form.

The self-employed person then registers certain losses and costs in the process of running their second-hand car 'business'.

These registered costs and losses can be stuck off as expenses necessary in the line of running the 'business'.

In Moyles' case, he claimed he had totalled £1million of losses during the course of selling £3,731 worth of used cars.

He tried to offset the claimed £1million loss in the 2007-08 financial year 
against tax he owed on his other income, his estimated £700,000
 salary from the BBC, funded by the British public who pay the television license fee.

Chris Moyles took to twitter to issue a reply to the news that he had partaken in a tax avoidance scheme

But
 he was not so keen to speak about the case when he still hoped to win 
it. During his year-long battle with the taxman, Moyles desperately 
tried to keep his avoidance scheme secret.

His legal team argued the 
tribunal should be heard behind closed doors so as not to infringe his 
‘right to respect for his private and family life’.

His
 lawyer also said if his membership were exposed, ‘his career might be 
damaged’. As Breakfast Show host, he earned £500,000 a year.

Judge Bishopp rejected this on the grounds there was an obvious public interest in keeping tax  cases public.

Jimmy Carr took significant flak from audiences after revelations of his use of tax avoidance schemes, especially since he had previously made jokes about it on the show Ten O'Clock Live

In 2012, comedian Jimmy Carr took flak for having taken part in a different tax avoidance scheme called K2.

The
 scheme, based in Jersey, involves people resigning from their company 
and receiving all further payments or salary to an offshore trust.

The
 individual then receives a small part of those payments as a 'salary' 
and the rest as a 'loan' which does not accrue tax because technically, 
it can be recalled.

This means that by using the K2 scheme people can cut their tax bill from £127,000 to £3,500 if they have earnings of £280,000.

Carr
 took insults from audiences following the revelations of his tax 
avoidance, and eventually apologised, but not before telling an audience
 who attended one of his shows: 'I pay what I have to and not a penny 
more.'
