Manny Pacquiao remains positive that his £200million mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr will happen despite the continued protracted negotiations between the two camps.

Talks between the two fighters have been ongoing since last year and WBO welterweight champion Pacquiao is believed to have agreed to all of Floyd Mayweather's terms.

The Filipino said last week that he was hoping for an answer from the undefeated American this week and Pacquiao is still upbeat that the fight the whole world wants to see will happen this year.

Asked by reporters on Friday how talks were progressing Pacquiao's response was 'positive', and the 36-year-old said that he was simply waiting for the paperwork.

'I'm waiting for a contract,' Pacquiao declared before admitting that it wuld not be up to him to announce the fight.

'I would not announce it, Mayweather would announce it,' he confirmed.

The fight is being planned for May 2nd at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas and Pacquiao revealed last week on Fox News that he was thinking 'passionately' that a deal for the fight will be thrashed out.

A video clip had earlier appeared on Mayweather's Instagram page showing him and Pacquiao in private discussing the potential bout. 

He said: 'I congratulate him (Pacquiao) on his career, he had a wonderful career, and I have had a wonderful career, but before we leave this sport of course we have to make this fight happen.'  

And he wrote: 'From the looks of this video... I'm telling Manny Pacquiao that we have to give the world this fight.'
