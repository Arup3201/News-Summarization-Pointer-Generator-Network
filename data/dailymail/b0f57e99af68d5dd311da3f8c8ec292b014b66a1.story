Horror: A father allegedly bludgeoned his daughter to death with an axe because he was ashamed she worked in a beauty salon

A father allegedly bludgeoned his daughter to death with an axe because he was ashamed she worked in a beauty salon.

That is the claim of Allah Ditta's children who watched him hack Shagufta to death near their home in the Adiala suburbs of Pakistan.

Police said the accused was arrested and confessed killing his 32-year-old daughter, a mother of one.

A blood-stained axe he was believed to have used to kill her, was also found, reported Dawn.com.

Shagufta had a young son and had divorced about three years ago.

Police quoted the younger sister as saying  'My father tied her to a tree in the jungle near our house and swung the axe at her neck, killing her instantly.'

The victim's brother, Fiaz Ali, said in a police statement that his father was angered after a lady that Shagufta worked for as a maid, offered her a position in a beauty salon. 

The younger sister said that Shagufta was beaten by her father the night before her death when she announced her intention to join the salon.

She said that the family intervened and they thought the debate was closed. 

But in the night she woke up and saw her father taking Shagufta away, holding a piece of rope and an axe in his hand.

When she went to watch the scene unfold with her brother, watching as Shagufta was taken away by her father to 
the nearby jungle.

There he allegedly tied her to a tree, abused her and 
then smashed her neck with an axe, killing her on the spot, according to the pair.
