A man who was caught with thousands of photographs of child pornography kept his stash of sick pictures hidden in a secret room.

Kenneth E. Smith, from Vancouver, had been collecting child porn for 12 years when the FBI visited him last July, but he went to extreme efforts to prevent his obsession from being uncovered.

His computer on which the graphic images were stored was kept on the second floor of an outbuilding on his property.

To get there, investigators had to open a hidden elevator; the operating switch of which, was disguised as a glue can.

Smith had been caught sharing child pornography online and subsequently found to have thousands of images showing toddlers and older children being sexually abused.

His hidden computer was kept in a room full of marijuana plants. The PC was disguised and used to control a sprinkler system to grow the plants and also store the illegal pictures.

Smith pleaded guilty to possession and distribution of child pornography.

He will now be heading to prison today for the next eight years.

Federal prosecutors noted how Smith failed a lie detector test when asked whether he personally sexually abused children.

He also refused to undergo a more thorough examination of his sexual history following his guilty plea.

Trying to downplay the allegations, Smith claimed he’d downloaded photos of older children after being distraught following a breakup.

Investigators found more than 8,000 files showing children of all ages being raped and abused.

'Smith’s actions contributed to the demand for these horrific images of child abuse,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Marci Ellsworth said in court papers.

'Every participant in the chain – producer, distributor, consumer – sustains the market for these images, and each victim, whether identified or not, suffers not only when an image of him or her is created, but each and every time an image of him or her is viewed.'
