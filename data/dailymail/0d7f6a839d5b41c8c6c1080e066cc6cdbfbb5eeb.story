AC Milan is the right move for Torres

Fernando Torres arrived in Milan ahead of his two-year loan move from Chelsea.

The Spanish striker was pictured at Milan Linate Airport on Saturday and will undergo a medical before completing his Serie A switch.

The 30-year-old replaces Mario Balotelli as Milan's lead striker following the Italian's £16million transfer to Liverpool. 

The Rossoneri confirmed on Twitter that Torres had landed at Milan's Linate Airport, where he was greeted by 200 fans, and posted a picture of the player holding an AC Milan scarf before announcing he was at the Madonnina Clinic undergoing his physical tests. 

AC Milan coach Filippo Inzaghi is hoping to guide Torres back to form.

He said: 'It's not up to me to describe his worth on the pitch, it's up to me to help him return to being the player we all knew.'

Torres, meanwhile added: 'I want to maybe stay here many years.'

The 30-year-old has moved to the San Siro on a two-year loan deal.

The £50million Stamford Bridge flop had two years left on his £150,000-a-week deal at Stamford Bridge and it is believed that his representatives negotiated a significant severance package before Torres agreed to a move. 

After a difficult start at the Bridge following his move from Liverpool, Torres' form never really picked up for Chelsea.

He managed just 45 goals in 172 appearances - equating to a staggering £1.1million per strike.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was keen to offload Torres before the transfer window closes on Monday in order to bring in an alternative forward - with Loic Remy now close to completing a move from West London rivals Queens Park Rangers.

Milan were believed to have been interested in bringing Queens Park Rangers's Adel Taarabt back to the San Siro but that move is now off following Torres' arrival.

The mercurial QPR winger spent the last six months of the 2013-14 season on loan with the seven-time European Cup winners, scoring four goals in 16 appearances.

Harry Redknapp remains keen to offload Taarabt once again.
