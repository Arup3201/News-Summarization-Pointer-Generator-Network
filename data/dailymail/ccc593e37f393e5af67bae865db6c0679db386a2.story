She has been home-schooled for almost three years - too scared to return to the place that made her life insufferable.

So deep were the wounds of her bullying, Renata was became afraid to go out in public, scared of being called 'that girl with the big nose' one more time.

'Im just afraid I'll never have any friends or anyone to be there for me,' she said through tears during an interview with TODAY.

But the 15-year-old, who did not share her last name or hometown publicly,  took her first steps of confidence in a long time when she set out to get plastic surgery to regain some of her self-esteem.

Fifteen-year-old Renata wanted to get plastic surgery so she can stop being teased about her nose, saying through tears she was worried she'd never have any friends.

Renata, who has been home-schooled for years because of bullies, said she was constantly referred to as 'that girl with the big nose'

She then made a decision to change her physical appearance in order to help her emotional state

Renata sent a letter to Dr Thomas Romo at the Little Baby Face Foundation in New York, a non-profit organization that help children with birth defects who can't afford corrective surgery

The teen was convinced that changing her physical appearance would help change her emotional outcome.

However there was a problem - Renata's mother could not afford a cosmetic operation.

A nose job from a well-regarded surgeon in Manhattan, for example, costs around $7000.

But after some research, Renata discovered the Little Baby Face Foundation, a plastic surgery group that treat children with birth defects for free.

The leader of the foundation, Dr. Thomas Romo - the director of facial, plastic and reconstructive surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital - said the group received hundreds of letters from children every year requesting surgery after being bullied.

Dr Romo defends such practices, comparing the results to the gratefulness of a heart surgery patient that is able to go jogging again.

Renata's mother agreed with her daughter's choice of surgery, saying that 'unfortunately people are judged on how they look'

'We can't go after the bully - but we can try and empower the children,' he said.

Renata's mother agree, maintaining elective surgery did not mean the bullies had won.

'I dont think it's sending the wrong message - (Renata) still sees what she sees in the mirror and it has an affect on her self esteem and confidence regardless of what anyone says,' the mom said.

'Parents crack children's teeth with braces to make their teeth straighter - they're still the same kid on the inside.

'Unfortunately people are judged on how they look.'

Dr Romo agreed to take on Renata's case after meeting with her.

He determined she had a deviated septum and a lopsided face and agreed to do the surgery.

Dr Romo removed the bandages from Renata's face following her surgery and recovery

What a difference: Renata's appearance is noticeably different following her surgery, in which she had a nose job and a chin implant

Happy: Renata says she is pleased with the result and is now ready to return to school, having spent the past few years being home-schooled

Renata then underwent a rhinoplasty procedure.

Dr Romo also put in a cheek implant to balance out her face.

The teen said she is happy and thankful for the results.

'I think if (the bullies) see you getting the surgery to fix something that they teased you about it would make them feel bad and maybe it would change their mind about doing it,' she said. 

Renata will this year start at a new school.

The full report will appear on Dateline NBC on Sunday.
