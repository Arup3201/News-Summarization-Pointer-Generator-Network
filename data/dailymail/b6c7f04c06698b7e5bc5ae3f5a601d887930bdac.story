The grieving husband of deceased right-to-die advocate Brittany Maynard has spoken out about the difficult Christmas he's had less than two months after his cancer-stricken wife took her own life.

'The holidays have been tough,' Dan Diaz, 43, told the New York Daily News. 'The last two holidays we hosted my family for Christmas Eve. We didn't do that this year.'

In spite of their terrible grief, Diaz and Maynard's mother Debbie Ziegler both recently wrote touching odes to Brittany's strength that affirmed her decision to end her suffering with a lethal dose of prescription drugs November 1.

'The holidays have been tough': Dan Diaz has spoken out about the pain of going through Christmas less than two months after his right-to-die advocate wife Brittany Maynard took her own life after suffering through terminal brain cancer

Brave daughter: Brittany Maynard's mother Debbie Ziegler (pictured) has also described how her daughter chose to forgo potentially life-extending treatment in order to remain more like 'herself' in her final months

Diaz wrote in his exclusive letter to the Daily News that Christmas conjured bittersweet memories of his vivacious wife. 

'It was Brittany who decorated inside,' he recalled, 'With lots of holly and wreaths.

'Sometimes my emotions drift from sadness to anger. I can't help asking, ''How did this come apart?'' But there's a saying: you can smile that it happened or choose to be sad that it's over.'

Debbie Zeigler reflected in her letter on the determination her daughter showed when she chose to extend her ability to speak and interact like her regular self as long as possible by forgoing potentially life-extending treatments that could compromise those abilities.

Zeigler writes:  

'She chose to live as fully as she could in her remaining months, planning trips to Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon and Olympic National Park in Washington. 

'She organized her trips and expeditions around relocating to Oregon where she would be free to utilize the law providing end of life options.'

'This ability to decide to live, to decide to notice beauty, to decide to be the most that she could be and then go before everything that made her who she was – was diminished, is what made Brittany the bravest and most intelligent woman I've ever known. I miss her terribly.'

'It was Brittany who decorated inside,' Diaz recalled as he face Christmas without his beloved wife, 'With lots of holly and wreaths'

Maynard ended her suffering November 1, leaving her loving husband to grieve despite his full support of her decision to take her own life

Maynard revived a national debate about physician-assisted suicide when she ended her life November 1 by swallowing lethal drugs made available under an Oregon law allowing terminally ill people to choose when to die

Maynard revived a national debate about physician-assisted suicide when she ended her life November 1 by swallowing lethal drugs made available under an Oregon law allowing terminally ill people to choose when to die. She would have been 30 on Nov. 19.

Maynard had been in the spotlight since publicizing that she and  Diaz moved to Portland from Northern California so that she could take advantage of the Oregon law. 

She told journalists she planned to die Nov. 1, shortly after her husband's birthday, but reserved the right to move the date forward or push it back. 

'She died as she intended — peacefully in her bedroom, in the arms of her loved ones,' said Sean Crowley, a spokesman for the advocacy group Compassion & Choices.

Crowley said Maynard 'suffered increasingly frequent and longer seizures, severe head and neck pain, and stroke-like symptoms. As symptoms grew more severe, she chose to abbreviate the dying process by taking the aid-in-dying medication she had received months ago.'

The issue of physician-assisted suicide is not new, but Maynard's youth and vitality before she became ill brought the discussion to a younger generation.

Working with Compassion & Choices, Maynard used her story to speak out for the right of terminally ill people like herself to end their lives on their own terms.

'She chose to live as fully as she could in her remaining months, planning trips to Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon and Olympic National Park in Washington,' said her mother. 'She organized her trips and expeditions around relocating to Oregon where she would be free to utilize the law providing end of life options'
