A Japanese hair salon is rewriting the meaning of cutting edge after taking fashion inspiration from the humble tomato.

The innovative design has emerged from Osaka's trendy Amemura district and is already spreading across the internet.

Stylist Hiro says the hairdo, called 'Ripe Tomatoes' or kanjuku tomato in Japanese, is his masterpiece.Â

Saucy: Sections of hair have been dyed green to look like the stalk, while the rest if bright tomato red

The look involves cutting the hair into a rounded crop before dying it bright tomato red.

Sections from the crown are then shaped and coloured green to resemble a tomato's stalk.

Sadly, like the fruit, the style has a shelf life.

The red and the green fades quickly and the 'leaves' are difficult to shape after being washed.

Ripe Tomatoes is one of a number of bold designs to emerge from the salon Trick Store.

As well as fruit, Hiro has also looked to the world of nature to inspire him.

One model sported a half red and black spotted ladybird hairstyle, which was teamed with pink girls on the other side.

A male model had part of head dyed yellow with black spots that resembled a cheetah.

Other edgy hair-dos included multi-coloured cartoonish rainbow effects.

One model's tresses were given a monochrome look with black and white stripes.

As well as colour, Trick Store staff are also not afraid to experiment with texture.
