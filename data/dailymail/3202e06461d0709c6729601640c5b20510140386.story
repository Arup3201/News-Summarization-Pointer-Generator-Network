A young teenager is the latest to be injured after a faulty USB charger gave him an electric shock - sparking warnings about the dangerous items and crackdowns on businesses stocking them.

On June 20, a 13-year-old boy was hurt after he connected the device to a power point behind a bed.

As he pulled the charger out of the power point, the casing must have dislodged from the frame, a Fair Trading spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

'He touched the live wires that were exposed.' the spokeswoman said. 'He received an electric shock and reported his arm was sore.'

Consumers have been warned about the dangers from knock-off chargers which do not meet Australian safety standards after a 13-year-old boy was hurt by a USB charger last month

The charger had been given to the boy as a gift by a relative and he had it for about two months.

His mother is now trying to contact the relative to find out where the charger was purchased.

On Monday, the boy's mother contacted Fair Trading after learning about the death of Sheryl Aldeguer, who was electrocuted and killed by a faulty $4.99 charger in her North Gosford home.

Another teenage boy, 14, was also lucky not to suffer serious injuries when an imitation USB iPod charger exploded near his head on June 20, reported The Daily Telegraph.

On the back oft these latest cases of USB device-related injury, Fair Training Minister Matthew Mason-Cox has warned the public not to use any unapproved knock-off USB-style chargers and electrical articles.

A stern warning has also been issued to retailers and importers who must ensure any products they are selling or importing are approved and comply with Australian standards.

Fair trading inspectors have been conducting raids across Sydney and in the Wollongong areas to prevent the sale of the devices

After receiving a tip off about dangerous USB chargers being sold, Fair Trading seized unapproved travel adaptors in a Bankstown store in Sydney's west on Tuesday and also at a Haymarket store in central Sydney today.

Inspectors found unapproved travel adaptors during the raids and warned the business to remove all unapproved products from sale and investigations are ongoing.

'Anyone importing or selling electrical products must be aware that they may be putting lives at risk if they sell unapproved products,' Minister Mason-Cox said.

Fair Trading has the authority to stop businesses selling unsafe electrical goods and can make them recall any unsafe electrical goods.

To ensure consumer safety, there are 56 classes of declared electrical articles, all of which must be approved and bear approval marks.

If retailers sell, import, hire or exchange electrical goods not listed among the declared articles, they must still ensure they are safe and meet minimum safety requirements.

Consumers are advised to check with suppliers to make sure electrical items comply with safety standards.

Fair Trading electrical safety experts also conducted covert inspections at Dapto markets, south of Wollongong and Haymarket Paddy’s Markets in central Sydney over the weekend and inspected two importers at Auburn and Silverwater in Sydney's west in relation to the possible supply of unapproved USB chargers to market stallholders.

Four stall holders at Dapto markets and two at Paddy’s Markets were selling unapproved USBs and the products were seized for inspection.

Thanks to tips off from local media, raids have also been conducted at other Wollongong and Bankstown stores.

Mother-of-two Sheryl Aldeguer was electrocuted and killed by a faulty charger on April 23.

Her husband Luigi Aldeguer told The Daily Telegraph his wife was speaking to a friend who was in Dubai when the incident happened.

The charger, which did not meet Australian safety regulations, had inadequate shielding causing 240 volts to 'arc' and pass from the charger through the phone into her body.

It is believed that Mrs Aldeguer died instantly and her body, which had burns to the chest and ears, was found the following day by friends and her landlord.

Police closed down a stall in Campsie in Sydney's southwest in June after a friend of Mrs Aldeguer told police that the faulty charger had been bought there.

Police seized a large amount of stock, including phone chargers, power boards and travel adaptors, which were found not to meet Australian safety requirements.

NSW Fair Trading Commisioner Rod Stowe said the rip-off, cheap chargers seized by the commission were low quality plastic that could melt and did not have insulation on pins or approval marks.

The accessory stall in Campsie faces fines of up to $87,500 and/or two years' imprisonment and Mr Stowe said it was very likely the commission would pursue prosecution.

This is the only know fatality to date that seems to be connected to the devices, but Mr Stowe said the public needed to be informed immediately to avoid further deaths.

'It's a wake-up call to people who buy cheap electronic products without realising potential hazards,' said NSW Fair Trading Commissioner Rod Stowe. 'If the deal's too good to be true, it usually is and it can prove fatal.'

Fair Trading Electrical Product Safety Expert Lynelle Collins said it had been five years since a similar death caused by a faulty electronic device but there was a serious risk of further deaths.

'Particularly with the Internet, people can buy stuff directly from overseas wholesalers that may not meet Australian safety standards,' she said.

It is believed that the voltage arced and passed through the charger into Mrs Aldeguer's body while she was talking on the phone

Police initially suspected Mrs Aldeguer was killed by her laptop, which she was also using at the time of her death.

As well as talking on the phone, Mrs Aldeguer was wearing headphones, which were plugged into her laptop. The laptop was also plugged into a charger.

It is believed the voltage completed its circuit by travelling from the faulty charger into the phone, into her body, then through her headphones into her laptop and then through the computer charger back into the wall.

Ms Collins said that even without the laptop the incident could have proved fatal.

Police in the Brisbane Waters Local Area command are investigating the woman's death and did not want to release more information about the death.

Consumers who have already bought non-approved USB-style chargers for phones or tablets are advised to bend the pins on the chargers and throw them away immediately.

People are also warned not to use devices while they are charging or plugged in.

Anyone with more information about the dodgy chargers should contact Fair Trading on 13 32 20.
