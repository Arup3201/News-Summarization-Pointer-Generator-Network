She may have shot to fame on TOWIE thanks to her permatan and vajazzling skills but Amy Childs is ready to be taken seriously.

The reality TV star has unveiled and modelled her new AW14 collection, which she says  definitely takes a step away from classic ‘Essex style’ and a step towards the catwalk.

With bold prints, strong lines and mesh detailing, Amy’s new collection takes inspiration from the AW14 runways.

New look: Amy Childs, who found fame on ITV2's The Only Way Is Essex, has unveiled and modelled her new AW14 collection, which she says definitely takes a step away from classic ‘Essex style’ and a step towards the catwalk.

Speaking about her new range, the 24-year-old told MailOnline: ‘This season is so different as I’ve really embraced the trends and moved away from my comfort zone. I also have more of a diverse range of prices as well as styles making more affordable pieces starting from £39.99, as well as designing for all shapes and sizes.

'My Christmas collection is going to be amazing, I shot it the other day and let’s just say it’s very Hollywood glamour and red carpet - perfect for the Christmas party with someone special.’

Autumn marks a busy couple of months for Amy as she is set to release a new capsule range in collaboration with high street giant Dorothy Perkins, her newly eponymous fragrance, her fake tan range and her new nightwear collection, which will be hitting the shelves in the next couple of weeks.

Speaking about her hectic schedule, Amy admits she wouldn't have it any other way. ‘I’m truly blessed. I’m doing what I love every day of the week. I get so involved with everything - that’s probably the reason why my tan took almost two years to make. I am too much of a perfectionist.'

Amy even says her selective nature is not solely business-centred: ‘I’m quite picky with men. I am so busy at the moment with everything I’m doing but I definitely am starting to think about love. 

'I do want marriage and kids down the line - just right now I’m so manic and focused on my career. I’ve been on a couple of dates but nothing serious. I am definitely single! 

'I love being in a relationship but it has to be the right person.’

Something for everyone: The businesswoman, who admits to having a cheeky crush on Harry Styles, says that she's included shapes and sizes for a variation of women

Speaking about her celebrity crushes Amy said: ‘I love Harry Styles. My friend met him once and I was so jealous! I also love a bit of Leo di Caprio – where do you think my Bulldog got his name from?.'

Amy’s hard work is clearly paying off. Her empire and business portfolios trumped her previous TOWIE co-stars' net worth in The Sun’s Reality TV’s Richest List.

She also spoke out recently about her surgery regrets, with her breast implant forcing her to stop exercising and causing her pain. ‘I did too much too young. My boob was so painful - I’ve only just started working out again,' she said.

The starlet has been showing off a trimmer figure at her perfume launch which she claims was down to ‘backgarden workouts and 3D Lipo treatments’ she recently has undertaken. 

Looking for love: Single Amy admits that she's picky with men and is so busy right now but is still on the hunt for a man (watch out, Harry Styles!)
