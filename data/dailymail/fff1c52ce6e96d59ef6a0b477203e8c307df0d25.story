Shattered: Keri-Anne just misses out on Olympic glory

What a splendid day for a dip in the lake.

The sun was shining and the water was warm. A perfect setting, it seemed, for double world champion Keri-Anne Payne to win an Olympic medal in the Serpentine.

But despite the roars of the crowd, and a formidable turnout by her mates from Team GB, she just couldn’t manage to refloat Britain’s swimming pride.

The 24-year-old from Stockport came fourth in the gruelling ten-kilometre event, crossing the line just four tenths of a second away from bronze after a race lasting nearly two hours.

But hey. The girl did her best. And 
from what she was saying afterwards about being caught in a scrum which 
swam only inches apart for much of the course, this wasn’t exactly 
sports day at Cheltenham Ladies’ College.

‘It was a little bit violent,’ she 
said with a smile. ‘It seemed to be a pretty tough, violent race from 
the start. I’m not really a fighter – I’m more of a lover I guess. 

‘I struggled in the pack with all the 
fighting that happened and I got hit quite a few times in the face. I 
tried to deal with it as best I could but it just took a lot more energy
out of me than I was expecting.’

Her failure to gain a medal after 
being tipped for success mirrors a disappointing Olympics for our 
swimmers, all of whom were trying to cheer her to victory yesterday from
the sideline.

Every time she swam past, they jumped,
wriggled, shimmied and cheered her on. Sir Steve Redgrave joined 
Keri-Anne’s bridesmaid-to-be Rebecca Adlington in the throng, as did her
fiancé and team-mate Dave Carry.

Before the race Keri-Anne found time 
to text Carry to remind him to put some sun-screen on.

They are getting 
married in Aberdeen next month and a panda-eye suntan for the wedding 
photos would be a definite no-no. Perhaps in anticipation, the official 
Olympic factsheet already has him listed as her husband.

Keri-Anne said later that she was 
caught off guard by the fast pace of the race, which, incidentally, she 
normally sets.

Heartache: Kerri-Ann Payne finishes fourth, just seconds behind her rivals in the 10km swimming marathon in Hyde Park today

But she also admitted making a mistake when she stopped 
off at the feeding station on the third lap. In open water races, 
swimmers tuck gel packs into their suits and are handed drinks on long 
sticks as they go by the feeding areas, usually flipping over on their 
backs, like an otter, to take a few sips before flipping the bottles 
away. But at one point she dropped the bottle.

TV cameras caught the 
green liquid spewing into the water.

This is a tough race, and not just because of the pain and endurance involved. There are other potential difficulties, too.

In the 2007 world championship in 
Melbourne Keri-Anne was stung in the mouth by a jellyfish. Swimming in a
Chinese river before the Beijing Olympics, she found herself competing 
against floating dead dogs.

And the 282-year-old Serpentine didn’t
meet with universal approval. 

One swimmer inspecting the water 
described it as ‘murky’. American broadcasters delighted in telling 
folks back home that the 28 acres of water was widely known as the 
Turpentine, despite strenuous efforts to clean it.

Furthermore, GB performance manager 
Mark Perry’s assertion that the royal swans had been rounded up and sent
to a holiday camp for the day with their families proved not to be the 
case.

Payne was just unable to keep up with the race leader, Eva Risztov of Hungary, and ultimately finished fourth in an exciting finish

Five minutes before the athletes 
walked on, 11 of the blighters glided by for a peek at the start line. 
They got a big cheer when they tried to return but were herded up and 
driven off by Locog cowboys in kayaks.

By the time the race was an hour 
old, Keri-Anne was among nine swimmers who had started to put a gap 
between themselves and their increasingly flagging opponents. And on the
last turn, with 1,000 aching, tortuous, exhausting metres still to go, 
the front four began to create a vast space of clear water behind them.

Keri-Anne’s tank was clearly running 
low. Still, however, she refused to give up. In the end, fractions of a 
second counted for everything.

Little wonder she looked exhausted 
afterwards. Touchingly, however, the first thing she did when she pulled
herself out of the water was to take a deep bow towards each side of 
the lake, where thousands of spectators had loyally cheered every stroke
of the way.

‘Fourth in the world is not too bad but not really what I wanted,’ she said rather glumly afterwards.

Her fiance said: ‘Yes, it was 
disappointing but the thing is I’m going to be getting married to her, 
so I’m just so very proud of her, and to see her smiling all the way 
through the interviews as well has made me feel a lot better.’

Rebecca Adlington tweeted: ‘Absolutely
so proud of @KeriannePayne can’t believe I get to call her a friend!’ 
she gushed. ‘She’s amazing! 4th in the world at such a tough event!!’

All true, all very flattering. But GB 
swimmers know they’ll have to do better than this to safeguard the 
future of the sport’s £25.1million annual funding.
