It looks like there really is no way back for Katy Perry's marriage to Russell Brand.

For removal vans were pictured removing the stand-up comedian's belongings from theirÂ  luxurious Hollywood Hills mansion today.

It is understood the California Gurls singer will be holding onto the $6.5 million property, and today it was being pared of her estranged husband's belongings.

A worker was seen opening the gate for the large Wetzel and Sons Moving and Storage truck.

The truck was seen driving down the lavish property's long winding driveway until it came to the gate.

The couple had purchased the home together just a few months ago.

It was later seen pulling up at another large house in the Beverly Hills area, which appears to be camp comic Brand's new US home.

Job done: Once it had finished its stop off at the expensive property the truck rolled down the long driveway

Once it had completed its rounds the truck was again spotted leaving the former Big Brother's Big Mouth presenter's flash new abode.

However Russell was spotted on Monday enjoying lunch in London, and it is unclear whether he is back in the States yet.

Brand announced on December 30 that he was filing for divorce from Perry, saying said: 'Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I'll always adore her and I know we'll remain friends.'

It also recently emerged that he had taken off his wedding ring in a video he posted the video on porn website Nudevista as he began a week-long tour of various universities in America.

After talking about how excited he is to visit college sororities, he is seen taking his ring off in full view of the camera, before adding: 'I'm just going to place this somewhere very, very safe for the next week.'

It also emerged today that Brand is being tipped to face a comedic onslaught from irreverent Ricky Gervais when he hosts the Golden Globes on Sunday.

Irish bookmaker Paddy Power taking bets on who he will turn his comedic eye on, and they are offering short odds on the couple becoming his verbal punchbag when he takes to the stage.

At 5/1 they are favourites to be joshed ahead of the likes of Madonna at 11/2 and Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore at 10/1.

Meanwhile Katy's father Rev Keith Hudson has apologised for making anti-Semitic remarks at a recent sermon at the Church on the Rise in Cleaveland, Ohio.

He said: 'I deeply regret the hurtful and ugly language I used in my message in Ohio.

'We can do lots of harm even to those we 
love simply by using words irresponsibly. I apologize for the hurt 
that I caused my Jewish friends.'

He added that he will not make such comments again.

The church's Pastor Paul Endreialso defended Hudson, saying: 'Even though this is wrong and it was not a right comment, he wasn't preaching about Jews, neither was he ranting against Jews.'

He added that he received only one complaint from among the roughly 300 people who heard the sermon, and that he would welcome Hudson back.

Jewish human rights organisation The Simon Wiesenthal Center denounced the remarks as anti-Semitic earlier this week.
