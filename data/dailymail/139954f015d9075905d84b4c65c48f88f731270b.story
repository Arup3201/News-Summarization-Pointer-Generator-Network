Another difficult foreign assignment. Another remarkable performance and result from Tommy Wright’s indefatigable  St Johnstone.

The Scottish Cup holders didn’t quite match their victories in Trondheim and Grodno of a year ago but this was still an outcome to be treasured for all concerned.

Looking every inch seasoned European campaigners, the men from Perth sucked up just about everything a lively Lucerne side could throw at them before daring to grab the away goal that gives them reason to believe in a week’s time.

Joy: MacLean celebrates the vital away goal as St Johnstone put in a superb display in Lucerne

Response: Schneuwly's scrappy goal meant that Saints could only return level for the second leg

Steven MacLean, the scorer against Minsk a year ago and the man who finished the job in the Scottish Cup Final against Dundee United, added another memorable strike to his growing collection with a goal shortly after the interval that temporarily winded the Swiss.

Truthfully, it would have been harsh on the home side had they lost on the night but the scrappy manner of Marco Schneuwly’s equaliser will rankle with  the Scots as they make their way home this morning.

But it’s unquestionably advantage  St Johnstone now. And, provided they display the same nous and discipline they oozed here, there is no reason to believe a third successive European adventure will end here.

The 17,000 capacity Swissporarena — a larger, sun-kissed version of Almondvale — made for a scenic  setting for Saints’ first competitive  outing since their Cup triumph.

Subs not used: Banks, May, Rodger, Kane, D Easton.Booked: Wright, Wotherspoon, Easton.Referee: Benoit Bastien (Fra). Attendance: 8,902.

Mercifully for the Scots, the oppressive heat of the afternoon had relented somewhat come kick-off and the sight of the surface largely enveloped in shade was welcome.

Lucerne might not be as big a name as the Rosenborg side Saints defeated a year ago, but a fourth-place finish in their league last season underscored the scale of the task.

Wright opted not to risk talismanic striker Stevie May on account of a thigh injury meaning MacLean was handed the sole striker role ahead of a compact five-man midfield.

The Saints boss had identified the diminutive Jahmir Hyka as the man his side had to watch and the winger soon showed why — forcing an early stop from goalkeeper Alan Mannus after floating away from Gary Miller then having a low strike blocked by the defender’s outstretched leg.

That aside, the Perth men looked comparatively comfortable in the early exchanges.

Backing: Plenty of St Johnstone fans made the trip to Switzerland to see their team get a good draw

Battling hard: St Johnstone were disciplined throughout and played like European veterans

Wright was frustrated that his side didn’t make their height superiority count at two dangerous set plays and gradually the Swiss awoke from their slumbers.

St Johnstone passed up several opportunities to clear their lines and were relieved to see Remo Freuler flash a shot over the  top after an almighty goalmouth scramble.

Adrian Winter then eliminated Saints’ defender Brian Easton with a beautifully-crafted diagonal and only Mannus’ fingertips prevented Hyka’s volley rocketing into the net.

As the home side cranked up the pressure, Schneuwly fizzed a  20-yarder off the crossbar with  Mannus this time looking every inch a beaten man.

Saints briefly bought themselves some respite with a cleverly worked free-kick. Wotherspoon looked to have overcooked his cross to the far post but Dave Mackay had timed his run to perfection.

Clearly taken by surprise, keeper David Zibung threw out his right hand to prevent the skipper’s hooked volley beating him at his near post.

The sound of the half-time whistle was still music to the ears of the Scottish Cup holders. Another gem of a cross by Hyka picked out Freuler and only Easton’ s intelligent  positioning on the line maintained parity.

Saints were well disciplined, although Frazer Wright could have no gripe when he picked up the only booking of the first half after taking out Winter following a clumsy touch on the halfway line.

The travelling party would have spent the interval praying for the same blank score come time up, so they were in clover when MacLean edged them in front three minutes after the break.

It stemmed from David  Wotherspoon’s deep in-swinging corner which caught Lucerne defender Francois Affolter off guard.

MacLean’s initial attempt to guide the ball home was blocked by the defender but he kept his cool, and arrowed the ball into the far corner of the net. The blue section of the stadium exploded with joy.

It might even have better before the hour-mark. Mackay’s header looked in all the way until Affolter swept it to safety from under his bar.

With the game stretched, the base of the post denied Kaja Rogulj’s header after the defender had bounded forward to connect with Winter’s centre.

Wotherspoon and Easton’s bookings were indicative of Saints’ increasing anxiety and on 68  minutes they could hold back the tide no more.

An untidy sequence of play ended with Schneuwly being fed with his back to goal on the penalty spot. With Mackay for company, he bobbed and weaved to create  half-a-yard and produced an incisive finish on the turn to square the game.

Substitute Dario Lezcano rippled the side-netting with the aid of a Wright deflection then made a  rickets of an Oliver Bozanic cross with the goal at his mercy.

But the Scots were not to be denied a result that promises so much for the return in Perth.
