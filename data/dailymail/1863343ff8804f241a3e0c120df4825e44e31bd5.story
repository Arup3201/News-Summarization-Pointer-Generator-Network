The death toll from an outbreak
of the Ebola virus in the Djera region of northern Democratic
Republic of Congo (DMC) has risen to 31 people, as on the other side of the continent more than 1,900 people were confirmed to have died.

The DMC Government confirmed the 31 deaths today, which are due to a different strain of the disease to the ongoing epidemic in West African nations including Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

Previously, the government said there were 13 dead. Seven healthcare workers are among the dead.

The separate outbreak in West Africa has killed more than
1,900 people since it was first reported in the forests of
southeastern Guinea in March, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said.

The organisation said the outbreak in Congo, in the remote Boende district around 750 miles from the capital of Kinshasa, was a
'distinct and independent event, with no relationship to the
outbreak in West Africa'.

It said that there were a total of 53
cases and said health care workers were tracing 160 contacts.

A statement from the WHO added: 'These findings are reassuring, as they exclude the possibility that the virus has spread from West to Central Africa.' 

The Zaire strain of the deadly virus is indigenous to Congo
and there have seven outbreaks in the country since it was first
discovered there in the remote Equateur province in 1976.

The first victim of the current Congo outbreak was a
pregnant woman who butchered a jungle animal in the village of
Ikanamongo and died on 11 August.

The WHO explained that the virus finds its way into the human population following contact with infected bushmeant - usually fruit bats or monkeys. 

Meanwhile, British Ebola survivor William Pooley told today how he feared for his life after catching the deadly virus.

The volunteer nurse, 29, has been given the all-clear and discharged from a London hospital, having received the experimental drug ZMapp to combat the disease he contracted in Sierra Leone.

He praised the 'world-class' treatment he was given after being evacuated back to the United Kingdom.

Mr Pooley, from Suffolk, was flown home by the RAF and cared for in a special unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

He told how he had been woken by a doctor in a full protective suit after blood tests proved he had Ebola while working in west Africa.

He said: 'I was worried I was going to die.

'I was worried about my family, I was scared.'

He said the worst thing had been having to tell his parents that he had Ebola, adding: 'No one wants to upset their parents in that way.'

He said he had no regrets about going to an area where the epidemic was rife but said he had no plans for the future at the moment.

He joked: 'They incinerated my passport so my mum will be pleased to know I cannot go anywhere at the moment.'

Mr Pooley is heading home to Eyke in East Anglia, where his parents Robin and Jackie live, to recuperate with friends and family, he said.

He said he was 'wonderfully lucky' to have survived a disease that had killed more than 2,000 people in Africa.

Infectious diseases consultant Dr Michael Jacobs, who treated Mr Pooley, said: 'The virus is clear from the body and there is no risk to the wider community in any way.'

The disease victim told how he had undergone blood tests after feeling ill in Sierra Leone.

He said he went to sleep feeling sick and was woken by a World Health Organisation doctor wearing personal protective equipment after the tests came back positive.
