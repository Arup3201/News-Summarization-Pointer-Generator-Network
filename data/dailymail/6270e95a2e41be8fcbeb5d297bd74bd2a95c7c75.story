As far as marriage proposals go, it is certainly one this couple won’t forget in a hurry.

For when Sharif Uddin, 31, tried to propose to girlfriend of four years Stephanie Jackson, 32, he became so overcome with nerves that he fumbled and dropped the engagement ring into a murky lake.

Instead of toasting their happy engagement, the couple were forced to spend three hours sifting through the mud and sediment to find the diamond ring – and she had no hesitation in saying yes.

Sharif Uddin, 31, left, and Stephanie Jackson, 32, right, both of Walsall, West Midlands, met four years ago while working together at the Royal Bank of Scotland

Mr Uddin dropped the ring into the 3ft deep murky pond water as he went down on one knee at Royal Victoria Park in Bath, Somerset, on April 5

The pair, who met while working together at the Royal Bank of Scotland, had travelled from their home in Walsall, West Midlands, for a romantic weekend getaway in Bath, Somerset.

Mr Huddin had planned to propose on a small bridge over a lake in a scenic country park but was so nervous as he got down on one knee that he dropped the ring into the 3ft deep water.

Incredibly, the loved-up couple managed to get the engagement ring back – but only after wading into the lake and fishing it out with rubber gloves and a sieve.

Bride-to-be Stephanie, 32, said: ‘There was a lot of swearing - he dived into the pond pretty much straight away, forgetting completely he had his mobile in his pocket.

‘Sharif had designed the ring himself, so I know he was very keen for me to see it.

Mr Huddin went to buy rubber gloves, wellies, sieves and a pair of swimming shorts before wading into the pond, left. He spent hours scooping up mud and sediment before putting it through a makeshift sieve, right, in an attempt to recover the lost diamond ring

Stephanie Jackson, 32, was relieved her husband-to-be eventually found the ring and said yes once she was finally presented with the sparkler, above

‘We ended up buying sieves and wellies and after about ten trips to the bottom of the pond, scooping up mud and that, we finally managed to find the ring.’

Miss Jackson hadn’t even had a chance to see the ring before it fell into the water during the hapless proposal on April 5.

The pair attracted quite a crowd of onlookers, who cheered when the ring was finally recovered from the muddy lake.

She said: ‘I couldn't believe it when Sharif scooped it out of the mud.

‘I hadn't even managed to have a look at the ring when he proposed - I wasn't disappointed.

‘It was a hilarious comedy of errors from the start, but at least it ended well.

‘I think it's pretty miraculous, really. Now I'll never forget my proposal. It was like a scene out of a movie.’
