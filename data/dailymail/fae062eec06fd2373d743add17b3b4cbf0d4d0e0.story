Anyone who has ever had their bike stolen will know exactly how Olguiemar Freyre feels. 

The 19-year-old student locked up her $700 bicycle outside an art shop only to discover hours later it had gone on Monday.

Furious, she penned a strongly-worded letter not for the faint-hearted for the thief and pinned it to the rack where she left her beloved bike outside Lakeview Art Supply, in Chicago, where she works.

According to Miss Freyre she worked hard to pay for the bike with the intention that it would be her only mode of transport because she could not afford to travel everyday on the trains.

So the student, who attends DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois, didn't hold back with her use of vocabulary in her letter to the thief.

The potty-worded tirade quickly went viral but despite being laced with swear words it led to a good Samaritan coming forward and buying the cash-strapped student a new pair of wheels. 

Miss Freyre initially didn't want to accept the kind offer from the man, believed to be well-off, but finally agreed when he explained the same thing happened to him when he was 20.

She told The Huffington Post: 'He really felt for me and just wanted to buy me a new bike.' 

The pair met at a shop where they bought Miss Freyre a new bike so she can get to university.

She told The Huffington Post: 'I didn't post the note because I wanted a new bike and I didn't post it because I wanted this attention. I did it because I was so mad.' 

Her new set of wheels did not cost as much as her old bike because she said she didn't want to man to spend that kind of money. 

The artist is now thinking of organising a bike drive to help others are victims of bike crime.
