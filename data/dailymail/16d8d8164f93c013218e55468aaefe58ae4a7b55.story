Schoolchildren as young as 14 are being used as drug mules by London gangs to transport hundreds of rocks of crack cocaine to villages in the Home Counties.

Scotland Yard smashed a large criminal network yesterday allegedly trafficking boys and girls to rural parishes and towns in Kent and Hampshire where they were forced to carry crack cocaine and huge quantities of heroin worth thousands of pounds.

Around 250 officers swooped on eight members of a Lewisham gang suspected of recruiting children directly from south London schools and youth clubs.

Police fear that London street gangs are increasingly using children to smuggle Class A drugs as they attempt to find new lucrative markets in leafy towns and villages around Canterbury, Portsmouth and Folkestone where there is less competition.

Under pressure from high-profile police tactics that have led to the break-up of dozens of criminal networks in the capital, drug dealers are shifting their operations to areas in the Home Counties considered a ‘soft touch’.

Over the past six months 15 boys and girls aged between 15 and 20 have been arrested in Kent and Hampshire carrying up to 200 rocks of crack cocaine or large amounts of heroin.

Many are forced to stash the drugs under their clothes as they travel by train from the gang’s south-east London stronghold to a series of rented houses where they deal on the streets.

Yesterday officers swooped in dawn raids on six London and four Kent and Hampshire addresses, arresting eight people, including most of the gang’s ringleaders, on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs, inciting supply of class A drugs, child trafficking and money laundering.

One of the network’s chief suspects was arrested on suspicion of trafficking and conspiracy to supply Class A drugs at an address in Tottenham, north London, with £3,000 worth of crack cocaine found at the home.

While the gang’s 20-year-old alleged moneyman was dragged into a police van outside a four-storey Victorian stucco building in New Cross, and arrested on suspicion of laundering the organisation’s proceeds.

As part of Operation Pibera, a four-month operation targeting the gang, police seized £1,500 in cash from a property in the North Downs village of Petham, five miles from Canterbury as well as raiding addresses in nearby Aylesham, Folkestone, and Portsmouth.

They recovered a large quantity of crack cocaine and a press used to package drugs.

The arrests included an 18-year-old man from Lewisham, a 20-year-old man in Haringey, a 32-year-old man in Kent, a 42-year-old man and a 31-year old woman in Hampshire.While a 20-year-old man, a 15 year-old youth and a 36 year-old woman were produced from prison.

Detective Superintendent Tim Champion, of Trident central gangs unit, told the Evening Standard: ‘This is a gang that has evolved to use children. The controllers of the network stay in London most of the time and use the young people to take all the risks involved in drug dealing.

‘It means all the points where they could be intercepted with drugs is taken by these young people.

‘They can recruit through schools or other means.

‘They are given the promise of money or goods in exchange which never materialises.

‘If drugs are lost or seized debts are incurred and the links to the organised criminal network strengthens. It doesn’t start with a threat, it starts with a promise. It will become mental or physical abuse at the end.

‘They will pick people who the criminal network deems to be vulnerable and perhaps children who are getting into bad habits.’

Scotland Yard identified more than 250 gangs operating in the capital last year, which has been cut by a third, with nearly 900 gang members in prison and another 200 subject to other measures including antisocial behaviour orders.

Although many of London’s gangs are territorial, based on postcodes and estates, the crackdown has led to a spike in offences being committed outside the capital as groups spread into new potentially lucrative areas.

But neighbouring forces are waking up to the new problem on their doorstep.

Kent Police Superintendent Andrea Bishop said: ‘To use teenagers to commit those crimes is despicable and would have far reaching consequences for them, as well as the public, if police hadn’t intervened to disrupt this London based organised crime gang.

‘Kent is the gateway to the UK and Europe and criminals may think that because of our location we are a soft touch. We are not. Our message to anyone who thinks they can pedal their crimes in our county is do so at your own risk.’

Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Dennis from Hampshire Constabulary added: ‘We identified that drug gangs from London were sending young people into Portsmouth to deal. These young people are themselves victims and we have taken steps to safeguard them and to work with them.’
