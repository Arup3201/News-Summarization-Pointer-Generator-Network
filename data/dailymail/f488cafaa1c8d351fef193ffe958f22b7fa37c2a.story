A would-be groom was stabbed to death at his own engagement party while trying to break up a fight between his two brothers and a restaurant owner.

One of the restaurant workers jumped into the fight with the newly-engaged Anthony Lacertosa, and the worker came wielding a butcher's knife.

'This guy stabbed me! Call an ambulance!' were Mr Lacertosa's last words as he clutched his side.

His fiancée Bridgette Schneider, 24, 
tried to help by administering CPR, and friends used restaurant linens 
to try to absorb the bleeding, but nothing worked.

Murdered: 27-year-old Antonio Lacertosa was fatally stabbed while celebrating his engagement

Proposal: Antonio Lacertosa proposed to his girlfriend Bridgette in December

They put him in a car and began driving to the hospital before flagging down an ambulance that they saw en route.

Mr Lacertosa, 27, was taken to Staten Island University Hospital where he later died.

The night started as a celebratory 
one, as Mr Lacertosa and his high school sweetheart Ms Schneider 
gathered with family and friends for a formal engagement dinner.

The group ended up having drinks at a restaurant where an argument apparently broke out with the management staff, according to a police source. 

Mr Lacertosa's sister, Antonia, told the New York Times that things got heated, with a fight breaking out into the street at around two o'clock on Saturday morning.

She said her brother went outside to see what was going on and was stabbed.

Crime scene: The area surrounding the restaurant was cordoned off, with a trail of dried blood stretching across the driveway and blue forensics gloves abandoned in the gutter

Brutal: Witnesses said a restaurant worker was seen grabbing a kitchen knife and plunging it into Lacertosa's chest

Witnesses added that a worker was 
seen grabbing a kitchen knife and plunging it into Lacertosa’s chest. 
The restaurant manager turned himself into police for questioning, but 
it is now thought that it was the manager's associate who was the one 
who stabbed Mr Lacertosa.

'He
had everything,' Antonia, 29, said. 'He would have made a great father.
No one would ever say anything bad about my brother.

'He was the greatest. He was a great brother, son, uncle, friend. He was big, and muscular, but he was a teddy bear.'

The suspect fled the scene, leaving Mr Lacertosa, from the Pleasant Plains neighbourhood of Staten Island, bleeding to death outside.

The area surrounding the restaurant was cordoned off, with a trail of dried blood stretching across the driveway and blue forensics gloves abandoned in the gutter.

Investigators have not yet identified the killer.

Planning now for a funeral instead of a wedding, Mr Lacertosa’s fiancée, Bridgette, was too distraught to talk.

In love: The pair were due to marry in eight months. Lacertosa popped the question in December

Long term: Antonio Lacertosa and his fiancee Bridgette were childhood sweethearts, having met at Tottenville High School

A photo on their wedding website shows a smiling Mr Lacertosa with his arm around a beaming Bridgette.

The couple, who met at Tottenville High School, were shopping for a house in the neighborhood, Mr Lacertosa’s brother said.

The brother added that Mr Lacertosa was 'a good kid. He carried this whole household.'
