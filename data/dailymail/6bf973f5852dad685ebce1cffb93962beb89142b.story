As Marussia follow Caterham into administration, former FIA president Max Mosley has warned that the two Formula One teams ‘may not be the last’ to struggle in the face of the sport’s high costs.

'It’s not a fair competition any more,' Mosley said.

'The problem is that the big teams have so much more money than teams like Caterham and Marussia.'

Both teams have been allowed to miss the US and Brazilian grands prix while a buyer is sought.

Mosley, 74, who led the sport's governing body from 1993 and 2009, tried to introduce a cost cap five years ago but those plans fell through and similar proposals were also abandoned earlier this year.

'In the end, they (teams such as Caterham and Marussia) were bound to drop off - and they may not be the last,' he added.

'From a sporting point of view, the sport should split the money equally and then let the teams get as much sponsorship as they can.

'A team like Ferrari will always get more sponsorship than Marussia, but if they all get the same basic money, then they all start on a level-playing field, particularly if you have a cost cap where you limit the amount of money each team is allowed to spend.'
