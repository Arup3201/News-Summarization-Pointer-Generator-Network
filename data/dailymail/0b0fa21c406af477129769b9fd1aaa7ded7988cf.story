A photographer has spent the last three years capturing the men and women of the U.S Marshals working in dozens of cities across the country.

Brian Finke documented America's oldest federal law enforcement agency by following their daily lives as they transport criminals, protect witnesses and track down some of the most dangerous fugitives in the United States.

His latest book differs significantly from his previous publications, having successful shadowed the world of American footballers, cheerleaders, flight attendants and construction.

Mr Finke, from New York, became interested in the U.S. Marshals after speaking to his childhood friend Cameron Welch, a current U.S Marshal.

The pair reconnected in 2010, which led to Mr Finke spending time in what he calls his own version of the TV show 'Cops'.

'I witnessed sex-offender round-ups in Las Vegas, Conair prison extradition from Cuba, intense Texas/ Mexico border activity, like in the wild west,' he said.

'But I never felt my life was in any danger. Maybe I was a bit naïve in some situations, but the Marshals are all about overwhelming force when going to serve the warrants. It's amazing watching them do their thing.

'I always try to start photographing without any preconceptions. For me the experience was amazing, putting on bullet proof vests and riding in right behind them. I had total respect for what they do.'

Mr Finke was thrown straight into the thick of the action as his first ride-along included a 120mph pursuit of an escaped convict in Huntsville, Texas.

He accompanied U.S Marshals in between his magazine and advertising assignments over three and a half years, following them during training right through to capturing fugitives.

He added: 'The pictures in the beginning, they almost felt too propaganda-feeling. It was just such an amazing experience - being there with them and being in awe of what they do.

'Normal, everyday men and women going to work and working really hard at what they do, complete respect.'

Mr Finke, who uses on off-camera flash technique, has already announced his next project, which will focus on the women who star in hip hop music videos.

Speaking about his documentary photograph work, Mr Finke said: 'It's a process I really enjoy, I like getting completely obsessed with an idea, thinking about it all the time, totally exhaust it then move onto the next project. It's a process that really works for me.
