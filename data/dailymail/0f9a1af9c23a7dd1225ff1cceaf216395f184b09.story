White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite posed as a UN aid worker in a bid to try and trick police into escorting her to a military base so she could bomb Kenyan soldiers in Somalia, it has been reported.

The British fugitive, who is a mother-of-four and originally from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is said to be one of the leading players in Somalia's radical al-Shabaab group.

The Muslim convert, aged 30, is on the run after she was suspected of helping to coordinate last September's attack on a Nairobi shopping mall in which 67 people were killed including five Britons.

According to security sources in Kenya, a woman fitting Lewthwaite's description, tried to trick police into escorting her to a military base using fake documents in April.

But it is thought border officials in the coastal town of Lamu stopped her and she left with three men before they had a chance to question her.

A security source told the Daily Mirror: 'This could have been one of the biggest chances to catch Samantha Lewthwaite.

'There are severe suspicions this was an audacious attempt to reach the camp in Ras Kamboni to plant an explosion and murder scores of soldiers.'

Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, pictured, who killed 26 people in the London Tube train attacks in July 2005

It is also believed that Lewthwaite and the men fled in the same Toyota 4x4, which was used in the shooting of two soldiers in Milmani last week.

Last week sources claimed the British fugitive married suspected warlord Hassan Maalim Ibrahim who is also known as Sheikh Hassan.

He is a senior commander in the radical terror group al-Shabaab which is linked to al-Qaeda.

Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations.

She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam and is believed to have moved to Kenya in 2007, just months after she condemned the deadly role her husband Lindsay played in the 7/7 London bombings that killed 52.

She moved to South Africa in 2008 and adopted the identity of an unsuspecting young woman who had moved to the UK with her parents as a baby.

Lewthwaite went into hiding in December 2011 after she convinced anti-terror police to let her go when she was arrested following a raid on an al-Shabaab cell.
