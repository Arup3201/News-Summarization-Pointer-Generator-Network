Swansea midfielder Pablo Hernandez is the subject of a £4million bid from Al Arabi in Qatar.

The club is managed by former Chelsea defender Dan Petrescu who has also tried to sign Xavi Hernandez from Barcelona.

Swansea paid £5.5million for Pablo Hernandez two seasons ago and may struggle to get that money back but he is 29 now and that may be the best offer they get. The Spaniard held talks in the Middle East last week and is eager to sign up with other members of Swansea's Spanish contingent also being targeted by Qatari clubs.

Light up top: Michu is expected to complete a move to Napoli with Wilfried Bony a target for others

Michu though is expected to finalise his move to Napoli in the coming days if Swansea can agree to an initial loan with £8million to follow in a year's time.

Sensing the upheaval, chairman Huw Jenkins is not letting Wilfried Bony or Ben Davies leave cheaply.

Liverpool have been put off paying over £20m for Bony and are weighing up other options. Similarly they believe left-back Davies is over-priced but £10m may represent a good investment eventually for the promising 21-year-old. If they don't pay they know that Tottenham may do as they like both players and are continuing to barter.

Liverpool will discuss a deal for Sevilla's Alberto Moreno again but it will be separate from the deal they strike for striker Iago Aspas with the Spanish side keen to loan the 26-year-old.

Swansea have held talks with Sturm Graz about 24-year-old Bosnia international midfielder Anel Hadzic. The move could see former Arsenal and Barnsley midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong move to Austria to replace Hadzic.

Aston Villa are looking into an improved contract for defensive linchpin Ron Vlaar following his impressive Woirld Cup.

Roma have already emerged as one of the clubs keen to tempt the 29-year-old Dutchman away from Villa Park as the Italians look to replace Chelsea and Manchester City target Mehdi Benatia who is continuing to agitate for a move.

Villa are also aware Fabian Delph's contract is running down. However, so far, they have been unable to agree terms. West Ham are among clubs keeping a keen eye on negotiations.

Villa have held talks with Swansea over a deal for South Korean midfielder Ki Sung Yeung but full-back Antonio Luna is likely to leave with Hellas Verona keen to take him while Yacouba Sylla has completed his move on loan to Turkish side Kayseri Erciyesspor.

Ki, who had a loan spell at Sunderland last season, would prove a cheaper and younger option than Esteban Cambiasso who Villa have also discussed as have West Ham.

The soap opera that is Leeds United produces new plots every day. The club have sent Switzerland international defender Jonathan Rossini back to his club Sassuolo just days after agreeing a loan.

The 25-year-old joined up with his new teammates at the pre-season training camp in Italy last week. However, Leeds have pulled out of the deal after he spent just a few days training with the club.

Colourful club owner Massimo Cellino pinpointed Rossini's attitude saying it was not right for Leeds.

Cellino said: 'We want special players at Leeds United. Rossini didn’t show enough during the three days he trained with the rest of the team.

'After speaking to him, it is clear that he didn’t have the right attitude to join Leeds, so we have allowed him to leave.'

Feyenoord are to rival West Ham, Aston Villa and Celtic in the bid to sign Chelsea's Christian Atsu.

Feyenoord are eager to build up their squad with Graziano Pelle going to Southampton, Daryl Janmaat discussing a move to Newcastle while Porto are keen on Bruno Martins Indi and Manchester United and Lazio have spoken about Stefan de Vrij.
