A teenager and a six-year-old girl have been gang-raped in separate incidents at their schools in the latest in a growing spate of sex attacks across the country.

Police said her body was found outside the school premises in the village of Bal Singh Khera, just 10 miles from a village former American President Bill Clinton was visiting.

Outrage: Hundreds of parents protest outside the school at Marathahalli where a six-year-old was allegedly raped in Bangalore

Reports that a six-year-old girl was raped at a school in Bangalore have sparked protests among parents

Local police Superintendent Soumitra Yadav said: "The exact cause of death can be established only after the postmortem report arrives. 

"But according to our preliminary investigation, this is a being perceived as a case of gang-rape."

Security is 
being ramped up in the area due to the visit of President Clinton who is visiting the neighbouring village of Mohanlalganj to promote the 
work of his Clinton Foundation.

Meanwhile, a younger
 child was allegedly targeted by a security guard and a gym teacher at 
an upmarket school in Bangalore.

The 
six-year-old's parents, from the eastern state of Odisha, only 
discovered what happened after their daughter complained 
of a stomach ache and was taken to hospital.

Two men have been arrested in connection with the attack that allegedly happened on the school campus during class hours.

A
 gym instructor and a security guard were questioned by Karnataka 
police, but a second identification parade is being held to confirm 
their involvement.

Bangalore's Deputy Commissioner of Police T.D. Pawar, who is leading the investigation, said: "We have a tough job on hand. There are 27 gym instructors in the school.

"The two we have now are suspects. The girl is traumatized and we are trying to check with her as to who harmed her."

Reports
 of the rape sparked protests outside Vibgyor School, near the city's 
Kundalahalli Gate, as hundreds of parents pulled down its gates and 
shouted slogans.

"They have handled it very shoddily," said Vivek Sharma, parent of a boy studying in the school.

On
 Thursday, school chairman Rustom Kerawala addressed a meeting of the 
parents where he offered his 'sincere apologies' and promised 'full 
cooperation' with the police in investigation.

According 
to parents, this was allegedly the third sexual molestation case in the school
 in the last six months, and the girls had revealed the same following 
the latest incident.

"We
 strongly suspect the role of the PT and sports trainers, as the victims
 are pointing fingers at them. However, the school authorities are 
protecting the culprits. We are worried about the security of our 
children," one of the parents complained.

It
 has been alleged that the school opens its gates after 4pm as the 
playground and swimming pool have been leased out to other agencies. But
 the parents have been objecting to this.

"Most of the time, we find people, who are neither employees nor 
students of the school, loitering in the premises. They cannot keep the 
gates open like this," they alleged. 

Meanwhile, Bangalore witnessed another alleged incident of gang-rape by unidentified men against a 16-year-old girl at a seminary in Hennur on Thursday.

The assailants reportedly rang the door bell around 2pm, and when the girl opened the door, they sprayed a substance on her face.

After the girl fell unconscious, they raped her. 

Former
 local member of the Legislative Assembly Nandish Reddy, whose child 
studies in the same school, said the parents have submitted a memorandum
 to the management to enhance the security.

The
 two cases are the latest in a series of sexual assaults that have made 
headlines in India, a country where rape offences are reported every 21 
minutes on average.

A new focus on sexual 
violence has swept the country since the 201 gang-rape attack in which a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital 
New Delhi.

More recently, it emerged last week a 14-year-old
 girl was dragged into a forest and raped on the orders of a village 
council in remote eastern India in retaliation for a sex assault blamed 
on her brother.

The attack took place after midnight on Sunday in a small village in Jharkhand state's Bokaro district.

Last
 month, two teenage girls were allegedly raped before they were found 
swinging from a mango tree in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

The
 new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised a zero tolerance approach
 on crimes against women, but violence and discrimination against women continue to plague India.
