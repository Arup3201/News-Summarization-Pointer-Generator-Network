A day without tea is a day without joy, goes the Chinese proverb. 

And Britain has more than adopted this notion over the last 370 years, as the hot milky drink is the nation's most popular choice.

The ubiquitous cuppa is as much a part of British life as indifferent weather or the BBC. 

The drink, since its arrival here in the 17th century, has shaped our history, our culture and our lives.

Tea time: The hot milky drink is now the nation's most popular choice after tap water

A new book charts its fascinating story from its origins to its arrival in Britain in the 1660s, to its development as something quintessentially British, slowly but surely integrating itself into our culture, language and society.

Written by famed food author Paul Chrystal, Tea: A Very British Beverage charts our loss of the American colonies, the Opium Wars, female emancipation and victory in the Second World War.

These events all owe something to a nice cup of tea, according to the author.

'Tea is synonymous with [the nation]. The story of our intimate relationship with tea is in effect the social history of Britain,' says Paul.

The beverage reflects aspects of the nation's trade, manners, fashion, art, drinking habits, industrial legislation, foreign policy, and health.

So put the kettle and learn ten weird and wonderful bits of tea trivia selected and edited by Femail, from the book. 

Some is legend... but most of it's true, especially the last one (Note: It's tea first, then milk, then take the tea bag out - and no sugar!).

Britons drink 165 MILLION cups per day

On average we each drink 3.5 cups of tea every day, which totals 165 million cups per day or 62 billion cups per year.

Seven in ten of the population (over age 10) drank tea yesterday; and more than 25 per cent of all the milk consumed in the UK goes into your cup of tea.

Why does tea keep you awake? Not caffeine... 

One of the legends surrounding the origin of the cup of tea tells how Bodhidharma, an Indian prince who embraced Zen Buddhism in the 6th century BC, travelled to China to spread the faith.

Meditation could be a 24-hour occupation. One night he (not unreasonably) fell asleep after meditating in front of a wall for nine years.

He angrily cut off his eyelids to prevent a recurrence, and legend says the discarded lids grew into the first tea plant: 'Cast to the ground, the severed eyelids grew into a tea plant which, when brewed, could banish sleep!'

Monkey pluckers: Enlisting angry monkeys in the harvesting of tea in China, a traditional method

Tea was harvested by angry monkeys

One of the ways in which tea was harvested was in a village in which monkeys pick the tea: the villagers stand below the monkeys and annoy them; the monkeys get angry, grab handfuls of tea leaves and throw them down at the villagers.

Nowadays 'Monkey-picked tea' (Ma nau mi ti kuan yin) is extremely rare but still available. It's a wild Chinese tea containing powerful antioxidants, and picked only by specially trained monkeys.

The drink that delivered boozy Britain from the cold 

The arrival of tea in Britain was perfectly captured by the American Agnes Repplier in her 1931 essay, To Think of Tea!:

'Tea had come as a deliverer to a land that called for deliverance; a land of beef and ale, of heavy eating and abundant drunkenness; of grey skies and harsh winds; of strong nerved, stout-purposed, slow-thinking men and women. 

'Above all, a land of sheltered homes and warm firesides - firesides that were waiting - waiting for the bubbling kettle and the fragrant breath of tea.'

Methodists think tea causes paralysis... and death 

John Wesley (1703 - 1791) is credited as one of the founders of the evangelical movement known as Methodism. 

One might assume, in his pursuit of virtue, he would have been an advocate of the social, medical and psychological benefits of tea, particularly as he was known to drink it. Not so.

He preached that it caused 'numberless disorders, particularly those of a nervous kind' and was alarmed by 'some Symptoms of a Paralytick disorder… when you drink tea it has brought you near the chambers of death'.

Tea leads men to idleness and women to prostitution

William Cobbett (1763 - 1835), a well-known beer swigger, believed that tea leads men and boys to idleness. It encourages 'a softness, an effeminacy, a seeking for the fireside, a lurking in the bed, and in short, all the characteristics of idleness' he said.

But for women, the beverage apparently, leads them to prostitution. It 'does little less for the girls, to whom the gossip of the tea-table is no bad preparatory school for the brothel'.

Drinking tea makes women ugly

According to Jonas Hanway in 1756, tea will 'convulse the bowels' and causes bad teeth, particularly amongst the ladies. 

Hanway insinuated that tea drinking amongst women made them ugly: 'there is not quite so much beauty in this land as there was'. 

He asserted that the children of poor mothers were dying because their mothers were spending their money on tea: 'those will have tea who have not bread'.

The great tea fraud

Adulteration of tea - a then-luxury, expensive drink - was rife for decades. 

Chemically enhanced tea was bogus leaves boiled with ferrous sulphate, coloured with a palette of Prussian blue, verdigris, tannin, or black carbon before resale; molasses, clay, sulphate of lime or gypsum were also used to bulk up tea and masquerade the fraud. 

'Smouch' was particularly noxious: this comprised ash tree leaves dried and soaked in sheep's dung then mixed with a sprinkling of real tea. 

Some tea contained no tea at all.

So pervasive was the practice of counterfeit tea that Parliament passed an Act in 1725 condemning it.

Plenty of tea for our men 

In the First World War the 12,000 officers and 320,000 men  of the Army Service Corps had the unenviable task of catering for the five million British troops - three million of whom were on the western front alone - on an everyday basis.

In 1914 the daily ration included 5/8 oz. (17.7g) of tea, which was plentiful, considering the average tea bag weights about 2g.

Other beverages issued were 1/10 gill (14ml) of lime juice and half gill of rum (70ml) at the discretion of the battalion commander - though some of these officers were teetotal and prohibited their men from having any.

The Germans, on the other hand, could enjoy 9/10 oz. of coffee, or 1/10 oz. of tea; the commanding officer dispensed 0.17 pint of spirits, 0.44 pint of wine, or 0.88 pint of beer at his discretion. 

Tea kept us together through WWII

'Tea is more important than bullets' said Winston Churchill. To the historian A.A. Thompson tea was England's secret weapon, 'what keeps 'em together is tea', 'em' being the armed services and the Women's Institute. 

Within two days of the declaration of war against Germany, the government requisitioned all tea stocks and dispersed the supplies around the country to spare them from destruction by German bombing. 

Rationing was introduced in 1940 in response to the German naval blockades: two ounces of tea per person per week for those over the age of five, enough for two or three cups a day of weak tea.

Tea causes violent disputes over how it should be made

George Orwell (1903-1950), [A Nice Cup of Tea: Evening Standard, 12th January 1946] was an incurable tea lover with strong views: 'Tea is one of the mainstays of civilisation in this country and causes violent disputes over how it should be made.' 

Orwell was a strictly no sugar, tea in first man. He goes on to expatiate on his eleven cardinal points regarding the correct way to make a cup of tea.
