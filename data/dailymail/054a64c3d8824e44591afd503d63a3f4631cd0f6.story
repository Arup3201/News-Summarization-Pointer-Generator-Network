Last week, it was easy picking for Sky Sports showing Manchester United live. Seven days ago, all they really needed was to point a camera at Jose Mourinho and let the Chelsea manager deliver the telly gold.

This week, however, it was more about the bigger picture. They had an entire city to cover. This they did by laying it on thick and heavy with the match they dubbed ‘The Derby’.

Now there will be plenty of you thinking, well hold on, what’s all that about with the ‘The’? A derby, yes. A good derby, again yes. Almost certainly one of the great ones, even? But ‘The’?

Regardless of where it is in the derby pecking order, the big point really was with this game, is that it was the two Manchester teams carrying a bit of baggage with them at the moment. So local rivalries aside, it was a big Premier League game for the pair of them.

Nevertheless, there were plenty enough of these games in the past that did ignite and remind us what a derby match is all about. Or as Andy Cole put it when discussing the belter he was involved in 1996, it was all about ‘three points, and bragging rights’.

From here, you may have thought a few old stagers once again locking horns might have been the ideal set up for a traditional tie like this one. But Sky Sports decided not to travel too far down memory lane.

They couldn’t have got more contemporary, for example, than they were with one of the ‘mini derbies’ they arranged prior to kick off. New United hero Angel di Maria was sat down alongside his fellow Argentine and City favourite Pablo Zabaleta to set the match up. And via subtitles, the midfielder was nicely on point when he told us ‘all derbies are clasicos’.

While in excellent English, the right back from the blue half was somewhat more mischievous when he said the two were ‘not going to be friends on the pitch’, before nodding at his mate and adding, ‘he’s not understanding what I’m saying. Don’t say nothing to him’.

But the highlight of Sky Sports production for this game was the other head-to-head they had arranged. This one, between their pundit, and former United right back, and the man behind one of Manchester’s most successful exports, Oasis.

Noel Gallagher and Gary Neville locking horns and swapping snipes was a real treat. Sat together at a much too empty counter in a rather too fancy bar for my personal tastes, they popped away at each other like the couple of hardcore fans they clearly are.

Gallagher was the man with the most to say. Happy to remind Neville of ‘the sheer comedy of Dzeko not knowing the score’ when City put six past United. That Rooney’s overhead was good but ‘he did shin it’. And that he hates the ‘hypocrisy’ of United, especially most recently after they sacked David Moyes and suddenly it’s ‘raining tenners’.

But Sky’s man was not to be outdone. Turned out he was just biding his time to get his digs in. When Noel told him Oasis had once had a meeting about the band investing in City, Gary chuckled ‘that would have brought some stability to football!’.

He then brandished the sleeve of a new Gallagher CD ‘In the heat of the Moment’ - half red, half blue - and asked incredulously ‘you signed that off?’. ‘All about one love’ was the musician’s awkward reply.

But it was all in good humour, and most entertaining in the process, too. What’s more, you were not left wondering if Gallagher might actually be one of those modern day ‘prawn sandwich’ supporters. ‘I learned how to sing on the Kippax’ he remembered fondly. Although there may have been a whiff of the posh nosh when he also happily proclaimed ‘I haven’t paid to get in for years’. Well we all would if we could, wouldn’t we?

So Sky Sports certainly delivered their all-star moment to get their match coverage going. Although I do wish there had perhaps been a red button alternative to it.

I’d love to have seen the ‘other brothers’ in action, too. Liam and Phil, down the local, with Phil trying to ask serious questions, while Liam threw cheese and onion crisps at his head.

A little idea for the return derby at Old Trafford in April, perhaps? You can have that one on me, telly people.

But hold on, you might be saying? What about the action on the pitch? Quite right, too. How could I forget that penalty save! What a blinder that was from Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff at half time.

All those years in the slips clearly paid off.

Although his opposite number from A League of their Own, Jamie Redknapp, was far from impressed. ‘He keeps telling me he’s a Preston fan’, said Jamie. ‘Now he’s kissing the City badge’. Very Gallagher brother, I’m sure!
