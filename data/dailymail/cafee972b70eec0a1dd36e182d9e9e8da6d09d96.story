A  pensioner has been bombarded with   personal NHS letters about sex change patients because his address is similar to a gender identity clinic.

For the past two years Vic Kellagher, 84, has been inundated with confidential papers detailing patients' intimate sexual and gender problems.

Mr Kellagher has a similar address to The Laurels, an NHS gender identity clinic. But anyone typing The Laurels into Google instead finds Mr Kellagher's address at the list.

Mr Kellagher, a former Met Police detective chief inspector, has lived at his current address in Exeter since 1995.

It was shortly after the clinic opened in Exeter in 2012 that he received the first unwanted letter.

He said: 'It was addressed here so I just opened it as normal and it contained very personal details about this man's sexual problems.

'It was a bit of a shock and obviously those details were very personal and confidential.

'My obvious worry is that should this sort of information fall into the wrong hands then it would leave the person described open to blackmail.'

Mr Kellagher contacted the South Devon Healthcare Trust, which apologised, and he returned the letter.

But  more letters arrived and, after one was picked up by a messenger, Mr Kellagher was given a batch of pre-paid envelopes to return any more.

Mr Kellagher said there was a brief period of respite when local health officials realised their mistake. 

But they were then replaced by letters from doctors and specialists around the country, including Plymouth, Brighton and Gloucester.

The most recent arrived on December 5, again giving names of individuals with their medical difficulties itemised on a separate sheet.

Mr Kellagher said: 'It seems the matter has been sorted out by the local health trusts who have put the word out but there seems no way of getting through to all the other doctors around the country.

'It is not the postman's fault and I know it is the responsibility of the sender to address letters correctly but I am hoping the clinic might be able to do something about its address.'

A spokesman for The Laurels said: 'We are very sorry that Mr Kellagher continues to receive our post in error.

'We have written to him to apologise and will do everything we can to minimise the chances of it happening in the future.'
