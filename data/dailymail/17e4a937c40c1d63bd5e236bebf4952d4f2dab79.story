A mother has hit out after a Princess Elsa entertainer at her daughter's fifth birthday party looked nothing like the Disney character.

Luci Hindmarsh, from Hackney, east London, had previously provided her own entertainment  at daughter Misty's birthday parties, but decided to pay £175 this year for the professional Frozen act.

She has been left furious after the entertainer turned up late and wore an ill-fitting wig and a sweaty dress that kept falling down.

A mother had hit out after performance firm AEIOU Parties sent this entertainer - who was supposed to be Princess Elsa, the snow queen from Disney's hit musical Frozen - to her daughter's fifth birthday party

Ms Hindmarsh said the entertainer  sung a 70s rock ballad rather than hit song from the Disney film

Ms Hindmarsh, 35, and husband Adam, 40, paid party firm AEIOU Parties £175 to provide the entertainment, but were left waiting 20 minutes for the performer to arrive and a further 15 minutes for her to put on her costume.

Ms Hindmarsh said the entertainer looked 'like she'd left a rave at 6am' and sung a 70s rock ballad rather than hit song from the Disney film.

Writing on her blog, she wrote: 'Apparently the Elsa outfit had been worn by another entertainer earlier that day and was wet with sweat.

'So our entertainer decided to put the outfit on over the top of her own clothes, which happened to be black.

'She didn’t even bother to put the costume shoes on and wore a pair of tatty black flat shoes. The dress came undone at the back, someone did it up for her, but it wouldn’t stay done up, so she left it to hang off.'

When one of the children asked the woman where Princess Elsa was, she replied: 'Elsa couldn’t come to the party, so I am here instead.'

Ms Hindmarsh added: 'The last thing our daughter said quietly to me before she went to bed that night was: "Mummy, why didn’t Elsa come to my party?” Which is not how I had imagined her birthday party day would end.

Ms Hindmarsh said parents struggled not to laugh as the stand-in performer struggled through the act

'The poor service also ruined the party for my husband and me. Previously we’ve done the entertainment ourselves at parties, and this year we had wanted to relax and enjoy watching our daughter having fun at her party.

'This was our daughter’s 5th birthday party, it was meant to be a really special and magical occasion for her. We worked really hard as parents to make it happen. We were totally let down.'

Ms Hindmarsh - who had paid half up front - phoned up the agency to complain during the party, but was told to hand over the rest of the cash otherwise she couldn't later complain.

The married mum, who runs blog Mums Make Lists, posted a photo of the apparent-lookalike on her personal website, which has been viewed more than 30,000 times.

One mum wrote said: "Genuinely appalled at @AeiouParties - be ashamed of yourselves! Princesses spread magic, not shatter dreams!? 

The company, which said an alternative performer had to be brought in at the last minute, has apologised to Ms Hindmarsh and agreed to pay a 50% refund.

Explaining the appearance of the entertainer in the photos, a statement on its website read: 'Sometimes pictures, we all know, can look worst than reality because of the moment too. Anyway we agree that she didnt have the time to prepare all well.'

The statement went on: 'We, entertainers, are humans, and as any other person, feel pressure and go down when we feel nothing we do is ok. The entertainer suffered a lot of judgement and it made it much more difficult.

'We assume the responsibility of the delay, the wet costume and therefore not having the right amount of time to prepare, but I think that if the party was so important as we also think it should be, Luci should have go to the entertainer [sic] and give the time she needed to look great.'
