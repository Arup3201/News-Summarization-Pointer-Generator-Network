Have you ever experienced deeply 
pleasurable tingles that begin in the back of your head and spread down 
throughout your body and limbs, triggered by certain sounds or physical 
sensations?

This
 can be anything from getting a haircut, hearing a paint 
brush against canvas, to listening to someone whisper. If you have, you are experiencing what is being referred to as ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response,  dubbed a 'braingasm' by those who experience it.

Canadian film-maker Lindsay Ragone is exploring the phenomenon - and the enthusiastic community which has sprung up around it - in a new documentary, Braingasm.

As sweets are unwrapped and paper clips arranged (common triggers, perhaps), voices tell us of what they feel when they hear their 'special sounds': 'I feel tingles going off from the top of my head, travelling down my spine.,' breathes one.

Another adds: 'The brain orgasm... leaves you surprisingly relaxed and soothed.'

Ragone is appealing for more stories to complete her documentary.

Rhodri Marsden, one of the first to write about the ASMR in The Independent, says it is sparked off by 'expertise, precision, reassuring speech patterns and gentle sounds.'

He says: 'I once saw a man talk for 10 minutes about the benefits of purchasing a pack of 10 blank video cassettes, and it left my head gently buzzing in a way that's hard to describe. The more gentle and redundant their explanations are, the more pleasure I get.'

Rhodri is not alone. The recently-discovered phenomenon, like so many others, came to 
light through the internet and now has its own dedicated fan-base, 
research page and soon, the first scientific study looking into brain 
patterns of people experiencing ASMR.

A YouTube search for AMSR turns up
 thousands of videos. Most commonly, they are young women, speaking in 
soft, whispery monotones about nothing in particular.The most popular, by theWaterWhisperers, has so far has had almost 800,000 views.

The ASMR Facebook page, which has 11,200 members, describes the phenomenon as 'a pleasant, often intense tingling sensation that begins in the head and travels down the body to varying extents.'

'It is often accompanied by a euphoric feeling, and can overwhelm the experiencer of a particularly strong ASMR event. Some ASMR experiencers are triggered from an uncontrolled external stimulus; other experiencers can control an ASMR event through conscious thought triggers.'

Birds of a feather: ASMR proponent 'Heather Feather' brushes her hair for hours for the listening pleasure of the ASMR community

One particularly interminable one made by 'Heather Feather' begins with a breathy explanation of what the viewer is about to see: Heather Feather brushing her hair while it's wet. Then, she plans to dry the hair, and then brush her hair while it's dry - all for your aural pleasure. The video goes for more than an hour and has 32,604 views.

Another, made by theWaterWhispers and called Let Me Take Care of You, features a young woman in a maternal/nursemaid role, caressing the camera, speaking softly to it, and assuring it that it's going to be OK, and dabbing its fevered brow with a washcloth. For 13 minutes.

One might expect such videos to be the object of ridicule, but it's just the opposite - people seem to let down their guard and let a stranger's soft whispers or the sound of someone brushing their hair comfort them.

Margaret Bennett commented on Let Me Take Care of You: 'Thank you very much for﻿ making this; couldn't seem to wind down till I found this, and now I'm all tingly and warm... time to crawl into bed and finally sleep. I'll definately [sic] be poking around on your channel.'

berecca123 said, 'This is by far my favorite video! Please do another similar because I could probably recite this due to how many﻿ times I've watched it haha. I LOVE the wet towel and the tucking in. It made me feel so cozy :) thanks a lot Xxxx.'

Comfort: Ilse at theWaterWhispers dabs her camera's hot forehead with a a damp washcloth in the immensely popular Let Me Take Care of You video

The owner of theWaterWhispers channel, who refers to herself as Ilse in her videos, is a Dutch ASMR enthusiast. She's made 211 videos, which include 'Saleswoman role play - shoe shopping', where she pretends to sell you a pair of shoes, 'Relaxing chocolate tasting' and another where she talks - whispers - the viewer through her grandmother's jewellery collection.

It's hardly edge-of-your-seat stuff. But for the ASMR community, this stuff is like a drug.

Sadah1986 wrote: 'I finally know I'm not the only one with tingly dealing if someone looks at thing or makes noises. I had it as a child an nobody understood... I finally know I'm not the only﻿ one.'

Another commenter wrote that 11:40 was his favorite part of the jewellery video - featuring Ilse scraping her finger over an earring.

In her videos she refers to herself as Ilse, but when she spoke to MPBN, she said her name was Maria. She said some of the subscribers to her videos include soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.

'And they share with me how much they struggle with their nightmares that they get,' she said.

'And the ASMR whisper videos, they actually help them fall asleep better, which is amazing because they sometimes say medications don't work, but these videos work instead.'

There are also 'unintentional' ASMR videos - instructional videos such as someone demonstrating Japanese bookbinding, making origami or, as many ASMR experiencers say, the late Bob Ross, whose combination of softly spoken words and demonstrating technique seems to push a lot of ASMR buttons.

Unintentional: It's unlikely the maker of this instructional video had any idea it would be a trigger for ASMR

It's unlikely that AMSR is a new phenomenon. YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have changed the way people communicate and share ideas and information - there's a forum for everything and our tendency to 'overshare' online has created diverse interest communities.

AMSR is the same - it began in 2009, a Yahoo! group called the Society of Sensationalists formed  'in hopes of finding people who experience the same sensation.'

In 2010 Andrew MacMuiris started a blog called The Unnamed Feeling, on which is a timeline of ASMR. That same year  Jenn Allen, who founded the site asmr-research.org site, and coined the term AMSR.

After that point, the timeline becomes crowded with events, media attention and group meetings. In September 2012 an ASMR app was released for Apple iOS.

So where to next for the mysterious ASMR and its devoted community? Well, a Reddit user and Dartmouth College undergrad Bryson Lochte announced earlier in the year that he plans to perform brain scans to study it for his thesis.

Lochte said he planned to release his preliminary discoveries on ASMR in the next few months. We're tingling with anticipation.
