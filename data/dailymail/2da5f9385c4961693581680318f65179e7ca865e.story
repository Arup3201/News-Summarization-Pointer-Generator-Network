The European Parliament is to spend £6million on a 'youth camp' to promote Brussels days before crucial elections.

Eurocrats are accused of ‘nothing short of bribery’ by organising the event for 5,000 16 to 30-year-olds ahead as voters prepare to go to the polls to elect new MEPs.

The bizarre event includes role play games, concerts and ‘idea labs’ to debate youth unemployment in the European Parliament’s Strasbourg headquarters.

Party venue: The European Parliament building in Strasbourg will host the Youth Camp next May, just weeks before Euro elections

The event has attracted controversy because it seeks to ‘strengthening a participative European democracy’ just before elections to the European Parliament in May 2014.

Young people will be chosen by charities, youth groups and the Parliament’s offices across Europe.

But more than 700 MEP will also be able to sponsor 10 young people each to send to the event, which it is claimed could breach rules on ‘treating’ voters during election time.

The event, which is set to cost £1,200 per head, is linked to Europe Day and organisers hope to attract heads of state and ‘renowned personalities’ from across the continent.

Tory MEP Martin Callanan said: ‘This is European Parliament largesse at its most breath-taking.

‘Sending impressionable young people on a taxpayer-funded trip a few days before an election is nothing short of bribery.

‘The European Parliament's authorities have really misjudged this idea.’

The extraordinary use of public funds comes after David Cameron declared war on EU waste, brandishing a colouring book at a summit which showed how it takes four Eurocrats to send a letter and depicting them travelling around town in taxpayer-funded limousines.

The plans for the event on May 9-11 next year include a televised question and answer session with the candidates running to be President of the European Commission, meets with heads of state or governments and an open air concert.

There will be a 'Youth Village' outside the European Parliament  and a street festival of cultural performances across Strasbourg. Stages will be erected for dance and sports performances.

Role play games will allow young people to ‘step into the shoes of European decisionmakers, lobbyists or media-makers’.

Waste: Prime Minister David Cameron has used repeated visits to Strasbourg and Brussels to call for an end to extravagant spending

There will also be a Debating Club competition and networking events based on ‘an adapted form of speed dating’.

Mr Callanan added: ‘Young people want the EU to help them into work, not to fly a hand-picked selection to Strasbourg for a busman's holiday.

‘With 23 per cent of under 25s unemployed in the EU, I can think of many more useful things to spend this money on like training and apprenticeships. 

‘At a cost per person of £1,200, this event will reinforce the view among British taxpayers that the European Parliament wastes their money.

‘These pet projects have to stop. The European Parliament's authorities have really misjudged this idea and should think again. Encouraging debate and youth participation is a good thing, but it should be done for a fraction of the cost, outside of election time and in a location with far better and cheaper transport links than Strasbourg.’

Controversy: Sitting MEPs will be able to take up to 10 people to the three-day event, just weeks before seeking re-election

The taxpayer could pick up the bill for some groups to travel to Strasbroug, and even pay for meals. Others will pay for their own travel.

A European Parliament spokesman said: ‘The Youth Event 2014 will give the young people who are amongst the hardest hit by the crisis the opportunity to actively engage in a dialogue about ways of improving their chances.

‘The European Parliament will open its doors to young people from all over the EU and invite them to meet with inspired thinkers and speakers with a wide range of professional experience to exchange ideas and perspectives on youth-related issues, develop new, innovative ways and solutions to crucial questions for the future and experience the rich cultural diversity within the European Union through the staging of various cultural performances.

‘Young people will be invited to get actively involved in all activities throughout the event: developing and formulating new ideas for a better  Europe in various formats and shaping parts of the programme with their own  contributions; and drafting the final report for presentation to the newly elected MEPs.’
