Prince Harry is set to receive £10million of his mother Diana's inheritance when he celebrates his 30th birthday.

He faces a £4million deduction due to inheritance tax, but experts say he could slash the bill if he gives some of the money to charity.

Harry, who is currently in Chile after watching England’s disappointing World Cup exit in Brazil on Tuesday, currently earns £38,847 a year as an Army captain.

Legacy: Prince Harry is expected to inherit £10 million from Diana's inheritance on his 30th birthday

According to the Sunday Mirror he could limit the duty to £3.6million if he donates the cash when he receives the sum on September 15.

When William received the same amount of his mother's estate two years ago, 40 per cent went was given straight to the tax man. 

A royal source told the paper: 'There is no way Harry would dodge the tax.

'There are few similarities between the average person and Harry and William but when it comes to tax, they also have to pay their way.

'William got hit with a hefty bill when he turned 30 and so will Harry. His aides have to work out the most tax-efficient way for him to handle the money.'  

Estate: The Princess (pictured with Harry in Hyde Park) left her sons £12,966,022 after an inheritance tax of £8,502,330 was deducted

The milestone means he will take control of half of a trust fund believed to be worth more than £20million.

Princess Diana bequeathed the trust to the Duke of Cambridge and his brother, Prince Harry, who were 15 and 12 at the time of her death in 1997.

Diana left a net estate of £12,966,022 after inheritance tax of £8,502,330 was deducted.

It is widely believed that with shrewd investment the fund has almost doubled.

Her estate comprised stocks and shares, jewellery, cash from her £17million divorce settlement, dresses and other personal belongings at her Kensington Palace apartment.

Diana stipulated that it would be held in trust to be shared equally between her two sons, even though William will inherit income from the Duchy of Cornwall estate when he becomes Prince of Wales.

In her original will, drawn up in 1993, the princess had stipulated that both princes would be entitled to their entire share of the capital on reaching 25. 

But details of the will were changed by a variation order granted by the High Court on Dec 19 1997 - three months after her premature death in a Paris car crash. 

Deduction: A royal source has said there is no way Harry would be able to avoid the duty. He visited the British embassy in Santiago, Chile, after flying from Brazil following England's exit from the World Cup
