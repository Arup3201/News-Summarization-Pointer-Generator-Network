In the predominantly male-dominated world of computer games, it doesn't help when one of your employees makes a joke that could be seen as being derogatory to women - under any circumstances.

Such a gaffe occurred at the at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) when Microsoft showing off its next-generation Xbox One hardware and games

During a demonstration of 'Killer Instinct' a male producer of the game was matched up against a woman, who appeared to be bad at playing video games.

Unfortunate remarks: A Microsoft presenter slipped an apparent rape reference into a Monday presentation at Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the biggest video-game conference of the year

Are women even allowed? In the male-dominated world of computer games, the 'rape' joke does nothing to entice female game players to want to join in the fun

One blog described the woman as 'playing a video game like a girl' perpetuating the stereotype that women are not serious gamers.

'I can't even block correctly, and you're too fast,' she says.

'Here we go. Just let it happen. It'll be over soon,' her male partner says.

The audience laughed at the remark, but many have interpreted it as a rape joke.

The banter continued between the duo laden with sexual innuendo.

'You have a fight stick,' she says.

'Wow, you like those,' he retorts.

'No, I don't like this," she responds.

Terrible instincts: The remark was made during a public demo of the game 'Killer Instinct' where the male presenter told his female opponent 'Just let it happen. It'll be over soon.'

On Twitter, the audience reacted right away.

'Wow. This is really gross. Male overpowering a female in a game, so of course, rape joke. Good one, Msoft,' @Vahn16 tweeted.

'Oh
 my god. One of the people just made a rape joke onstage and the 
audience actually liked it. That's sick,' @IatosHaunted tweeted.

'Even
 if it was unintentional, Microsoft should've realized they shouldn't 
make a rape joke in an environment already toxic with misogyny,' @stillgray tweeted.

'Let's 
bring a woman on stage and joke about how she's bad at games, and say 
stuff like 'relax, just let it happen, it'll be over soon'??' @Jonathan_Blow tweeted.

Boys only: Attendees play XBox One games at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, California

A spokesperson for the company released a statement: 'The comments in question during the 'Killer Instinct' demo were not scripted. The demo was meant to include friendly gameplay banter, and there was no ill intent.'

Microsoft has issued an apology for an inappropriate joke made during a demonstration of 'Killer Instinct' at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) on Monday.

During a demonstration a male producer of the game was matched up against a woman, who appeared to be bad at playing video games.

There was some awkward banter between the two gamers that was interpreted as a rape joke by the audience, when the man said: 'Just let it happen. It'll be over soon.'

Microsoft apologized for the behavior of its employee and issued this statement from Microsoft Studios corporate vice president Phil Spencer.

'Yesterday, during the Xbox E3 briefing, one of our employees made an off the cuff and inappropriate comment while demoing 'Killer Instinct' with another employee. This comment was offensive and we apologize. At Microsoft, being open and respectful with others is central to our code of conduct and our values. Bullying and harassment of any kind is not condoned and is taken very seriously. We remain committed to make gaming fun for everyone, and in that effort, we must lead by example.'

This is the second rape debacle in as many years at E3. Last year gamers were disturbed by a cuty-scene in video game Tomb Raider where players were required to save Lara Croft from being sexually assaulted.

Though 47 per cent of gamers are female, according to a report by the Entertainment Software Association, sexism in the gaming industry has long been a problem.
