Manuel Neuer is philosophical over missing out on the Ballon d'Or but hinted it would be tough for a goalkeeper to win the prestigious award.

The Bayern Munich and Germany shot-stopper finished third in the overall result, behind winner Cristiano Ronaldo and second-placed Lionel Messi.

Asked whether he was disappointed with the result, Neuer admitted in quotes on the German Football Association's official website: 'I was always aware that it was going to be difficult to beat the strikers.

'Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi made their mark on world football last year. As a goalkeeper it's more difficult to do that.

'When a game of football is on, the first thing that anyone asks is who scored the goals and not about how the goalkeeper has performed. I don't think that'll change.'

Neuer was named in the team of the year after helping Bayern to the Bundesliga title while he had a starring role in Germany's World Cup triumph.

'I'm a good sport and I picked up an award anyway - I was named the goalkeeper in the team of the year,' he added.

'It was a special evening. Us Germans picked up a lot of awards, so maybe a personal victory was a bit too much to ask for.

'Being in the top three isn't just for me, it's for all goalkeepers. I'm proud about this. The nomination is also for goalkeepers who performed well in previous years.

'It's a year that I'll have good memories of when I grow older and look back at my career. It's certainly something that will be difficult to improve on.'

The 28-year-old's brilliant year was completed by helping Germany to win the World Cup last summer

But Neuer was at least named as the goalkeeper in the FIFPro world team of the year
