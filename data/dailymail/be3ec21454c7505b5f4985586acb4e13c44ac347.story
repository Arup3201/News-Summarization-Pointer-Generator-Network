PFA chairman Ritchie Humphreys says the players' union supports Greg Dyke's proposals to increase homegrown talent in the Premier League.

Dyke – the FA chairman who also heads the commission tasked with improving the national team – revealed this week that he wants to increase the minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12.

He also wants to redefine 'homegrown' as three years spent at a club before a player's 18th birthday, not his 21st as it currently stands.

And Humphreys, who is also a member of the FA Commission, told Sportsmail: 'Any foreign player who comes to this country we welcome to the Union.

'But we also have a duty of care to our national game and to homegrown players and their development.

'Everything we are working towards on the FA Commission is with the aim of making our national side more competitive at elite level.

'The PFA supports that. We want to see homegrown players – such as Harry Kane – given that chance at first-team level.

'The proposals will make clubs think differently about recruitment and will hopefully see more homegrown players given game-time.

'I got my opportunity when I was 18 at Sheffield Wednesday in the Premier League. I probably had a bit of good fortune as well, but the opportunity was there and we want that pathway to be there for players of this generation. 'The best foreign players will still play in the Premier League – this does not mean no foreign players, far from it.

'But there were 83 non-homegrown players who played less than 10 games last season, and we feel that number could be reduced.'
