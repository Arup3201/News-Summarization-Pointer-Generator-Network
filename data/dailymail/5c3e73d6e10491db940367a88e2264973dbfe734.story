The Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima were among the crowds that flocked outside to watch the partial solar eclipse this morning.

Resplendent in a crimson ensemble, 43-year-old Maxima donned protective glasses and watched from a wharf in Hamburg alongside her husband.

Perhaps not finding the eclipse quite as dramatic as she had hoped, the Argentina-born royal soon began laughing and whipped off her glasses.

The Dutch royal couple are currently in the middle of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany with Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg on their itinerary.

In Britain, millions turned out to watch the first solar eclipse of this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness.

Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the Moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country.

Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic, resulting in a partial eclipse across the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. 

Is that it? A less enamoured Maxima took off her glasses early and turned away

On tour: The Dutch royals are touring Hamburg today as part of a brief 48-hour tour of northern Germany

Meeting: They are attending a meeting aimed at boosting Dutch business and trade links

Gas: The royal couple are also being shown a new barge that is fitted out to carry liquefied natural gas

Maxima and Willem-Alexander arrived Germany yesterday, after completing a short three-day tour of Denmark.

Having waved goodbye to their Danish hosts at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport, they flew on to Lübeck where they were greeted by excited well-wishers clutching hand-painted portraits.

After a lunchtime reception, they then continued on to the Thünen Institute for Organic Farming in Trenthorst, where Maxima came dangerously close to getting her shoe stuck in some silage.

Along with watching the eclipse, today's schedule includes a meeting at Hamburg's Fischauktionshalle to discuss business opportunities for Dutch firms in Germany.

The royals will also be shown a newly-built barge, named the Hummel, which is designed to carry liquefied natural gas.

All natural: Yesterday, Maxima came close to treading in some silage (fermented hay) during a farm visit

Warm welcome: The couple arrived in Lübeck to be met by well-wishers proffering portraits of them

Maxima and Willem-Alexander will also tour the Joop van den Ende Academy, which focuses on innovation  in theatre technology - also a speciality of the Dutch performing arts sector.

So keen are the Dutch royals on giving local performers a boost, they flew four dancers from Amsterdam to Copenhagen for a performance on Wednesday night.

The men, all from the Het International Choreographic Arts Centre, got their big moment during a banquet hosted by Maxima and Willem-Alexander for the Danish royals.

Designed to give Dutch culture a platform, the minimally-clad performers treated Denmark's Queen Margrethe and her family to an unusual modern dance performance.

Watching from the front row was Maxima herself, elegant in a patriotic russet dress beside the Scandinavian country's Crown Prince Frederik.  

Interesting: The couple spent their last night in Denmark treating their hosts to a Dutch dance performance

Keep smiling: Maxima appeared to enjoy the modern dance performance and beamed throughout

Looking good: The 43-year-old Dutch Queen looked fabulous in a patriotic russet gown

Round of applause: All the royals politely applauded at the end of the performance
