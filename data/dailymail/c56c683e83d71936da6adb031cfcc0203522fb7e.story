Parts of southern Britain were spoiled with beautiful sunshine today - but not after thick fog caused early-morning havoc to aeroplane passengers.

Much of the South was blanketed in fog this morning with flights delayed as visibility dropped to less than 350ft in places.

Some of the worst conditions were in Kent, with other parts of south-east England, London, East Anglia and the East Midlands also affected.

'Be aware': The Met Office issued a severe weather warning, with fog affecting much of the South East

In
 London, the Woolwich Ferry was unable to operate, while Kent Police 
warned the public to take care. The Met Office issued a severe weather 
warning.

A spokesman said: 
‘Widespread fog is affecting much of East Anglia, south-east England and
 the East Midlands this morning with visibility reduced to 100 metres (328ft) or
 less in places.

‘The public
 should be aware that this will lead to difficult travelling conditions 
during this morning's busy period. The fog should gradually lift and 
disperse during the morning.’

Earlier, a
 London City Airport spokesman said on Twitter: 'We're experiencing some delays 
this morning as a result of low visibility - check with your airline 
before you travel.'

Meanwhile, 
thousands of Britons were also affected by Air France pilots beginning a
 week-long strike in a dispute over cost cuts, which has seen about half of the airline’s flights cancelled.

This is the moment a twister-like phenomenon was photographed piercing through the clouds.

Liam Langley, 35, captured the strange cloud formation swirling above his home in Netherton, Merseyside, at around 6pm last night.

The images show the unusual cloud piercing through the dark skyline towards the ground only a short distance away from Mr Langley’s home.

He said: ‘I just watched it whizzing around as it got wider and then thinner. It was an amazing thing to see - it’s not something I’ve seen before.’

Experts said the cone-shaped cloud was probably a funnel cloud and not a mini-tornado.

A Met Office spokesman said: ‘There are a couple of showers forecast in that area right now.

'But we are not seeing anything to suggest a tornado or twister.

‘It is more likely that what people are seeing are funnel clouds which are cone-shaped clouds.

'(These) extend from the base of a cloud towards the ground without reaching the ground.’

Funnel clouds are formed in the same way as tornadoes, but they do not reach the surface of the Earth.

When a funnel cloud reaches land it is classed as a tornado - or if it reaches a body of water, it becomes a waterspout.
