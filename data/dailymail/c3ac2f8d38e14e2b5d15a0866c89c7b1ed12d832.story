Attorneys for a federal agent charged with killing a man in a McDonald's restaurant in Hawaii says his client was protecting himself and others, despite his victim being unarmed.

State Department Special Agent Christopher Deedy made his first court appearance Thursday on charges of second-degree murder in the November 5th shooting of 23-year-old Kollin Elderts of Kailua.

The 27-year-old agent from Arlington, Va., was in Honolulu to help with security for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.

Attorney Brook Hart told The Associated Press the early-morning incident started because Elderts 'was harassing and bullying another person' at the McDonald's.

Hart says Deedy has been staying in Honolulu with his wife since he was released on $250,000 bond.

Deedy's case has been forwarded to Circuit Court, where he is scheduled to appear Monday.

An official spokesman for the Department
of State confirmed to MailOnline that Deedy was in Hawaii to protect 
U.S. dignitaries at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which was attended by President Barack Obama and the First Lady over the weekend.

Deedy, who is attached to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, was charged with second-degree murder and using a firearm in the commission of a felony.

Honolulu
police said Deedy was released from jail at 5:15 am the morning following his arrest.

Police
spokesman Carolyn Sluyter said Mr Elderts, Deedy and two other men were
involved in a confrontation at the restaurant when the shooting 
occurred after an earlier altercation at a nightclub.

Mr Elderts suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Deedy was arrested at the scene, Ms Sluyter said. She did not identify the other two men.

Michael Green, an attorney for Mr 
Elderts' family, said the victim and Deedy didn't know each other and 
that Mr Elderts was unarmed.

The shooting came as security was ramped
up in the area for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit which started the next day.

According to Mr Green, Deedy followed the victim to the McDonald's at 3am.

The lawyer said the victim 'was in a club and got 
into a beef with a guy who turned out to be a federal agent. The guy 
followed [Elderts] to McDonald's and shot him once in the chest'.

Mr Green did not know the name of the nightclub. He added: 'Nothing good happens at three o'clock.'

Mr Green told Hawaii News Now: ‘If you have a group of people, including this agent, at a bar or club, what’s the likelihood of all of them winding up at this McDonald’s shortly after that, before the club is closed? Someone apparently followed someone.’

He added: ‘He’s an agent of the federal government and my guess is he’s on duty 24 hours, just like our Honolulu Police Department people are.

‘And so there are some issues involved and there are some legal questions that have to be answered.’

The attorney said that a blood alcohol test was likely to take place.

'We can't wait to see those test results,' he added.

Mr Green said he was in the process of tracking any surveillance videos from the McDonald’s and surrounding businesses.

Mr Elderts, 23, was a graduate of Kalaheo High School in Kailua.

His criminal record consisted of a 2008 disorderly conduct violation, for which he was ordered to pay $150 and a 2010 petty misdemeanor for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, for which he paid a $300 fine.
