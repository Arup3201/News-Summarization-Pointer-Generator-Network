Yaya Toure claims nobody cares abut Ivory Coast's controversial exit from the World Cup because they are African.

The Elephants were knocked out in the last minute of their final group game against Greece when Georgios Samaras converted a disputed penalty.

And Manchester City midfielder Toure insists their exit has been brushed under the carpet.

'I desperately wanted the referee to spot the simulation of Samaras,' told France Football.

'Once again, the refereeing was not on our side. We had at least two penalties turned down during our game against Japan.

'And this time, one is invented against Greece. Of course, it does not upset anyone because it only concerns an African team.

'Who really cares about the injustices of an African team? This mistake deprives us of something huge. It is a scandal that unfortunately does not seem to bother many people.'

Ivory Coast were within 90 seconds of reaching the last 16 but a reckless foul by substitute Giovanni Sio enabled Samaras to rifle in the penalty to secure a 2-1 win in Fortaleza and allow Greece to progress to the last 16 for the first time in their history.

Wilfried Bony had earlier equalised Andreas Samaris's opener before the spot kick was awarded.

Greece were knocked out on penalties by Costa Rica on Sunday following a 1-1 draw.
