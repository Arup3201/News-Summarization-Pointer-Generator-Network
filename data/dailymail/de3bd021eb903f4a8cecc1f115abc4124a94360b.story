Emmy Award-winning comedian and writer Tom Davis - who along with Al Franken formed the comedy duo 'Franken and Davis' on NBC's Saturday Night Live - has died aged 59.Mr Davis, hailed as one of the best comedy writers of his generation, died of throat and neck cancer on Thursday at his home in Hudson New York, his wife Mimi Raleigh told the New York Times.

The entertainer grew up in Minnesota where he met Franken, and the two formed a comedy duo when they were teenagers.

Emmy Award winning comedy writer Tom Davis is famed for forming one half of The Franken and Davis Show on Saturday Night Live, (seen here performing in 1978)

Mr Davis wrote for Saturday Night Live from 1975 to 2003, and famously shared a writing salary with Franken when he first joined the show.

One of the best known sketches Mr Davis helped create on the show was 'Theodoric of York.'

The sketch starred comedy actor Steve Martin and was about a barber surgeon who relied on bloodletting to cure any ailment.

Mr Davis also worked on Saturday Night Live's popular 'Conehead' sketches about a family of aliens living in the United States who famously consumed 'mass quantities' of beer and cigarettes.

He co-wrote the 1993 film adaptation along with Dan Aykroyd, who starred as the alien father 'Beldar' in both the show and film versions.

The talented writer won three Emmy Awards for his work on Saturday Night Live and one for The Paul Simon Special in 1977, and was nominated for another nine.

Mr Davis reminisces with old friend and fan Mary Duffy while signing books in Minneapolis in 2009. He died in New York on Thursday aged 59

Mr Franken, who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008 to represent Minnesota after a long career in show business, remembered Davis as 'a great friend, a good man, and so funny' and he called his death 'a sad day for all of us who loved Tom.'

In a statement, he said he had spoken with Davis' mother on Thursday 'and she recalled fondly all the laughter that would come from the basement when Tom and I first got started in comedy.'

Lorne Michaels, the creator of Saturday Night Live, credited Davis with helping to get the long-running show off the ground.

'He was there from the beginning,' Michaels said in a statement.

'No one saw things the way that Tom did.

'He was funny, he was original and he was always there to help, no matter the hour - and I always trusted his laugh. I can still kinda hear it.'

Jim Downey, a long time writer for Saturday Night Live who began working with Davis in 1976, called him 'a loyal friend, a generous and supportive collaborator, and utterly unthreatened by the success of talent of those around him.'

'His old pals have known for some time that this day was coming, but still it's hard to accept that he's now no longer out there, somewhere, thinking those crazy thoughts that no one else would think.'
