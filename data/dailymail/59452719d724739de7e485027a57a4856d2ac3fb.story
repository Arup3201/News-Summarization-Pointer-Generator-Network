Manchester City will be entitled to up to £2million if Gareth Barry signs for Everton upon the expiry of his contract this summer.

The 33-year-old midfielder’s deal at the Etihad Stadium runs out at the end of June and he will then be free to talk with clubs in England and abroad as he looks to find a club ahead of the new season.

Barry was on loan at Everton last season and he enjoyed an excellent campaign as Everton challenged for a Champions League place before ultimately just falling short in their attempts to secure a position in the top four of the Barclays Premier League.

Windfall: Manchester City could cash in if Gareth Barry completes a move to Everton

Everton manager Roberto Martinez is hopeful of persuading Barry to sign on permanently at Goodison Park this summer but it might come at some cost to the Merseyside team.

Sportsmail understands that as part of last season’s loan agreement, a clause was inserted that entitles City to a staggered windfall if Barry decides to join Everton.

If he signs a one-year deal at Goodison Park, City will scoop £1m but that figure will rise to £1.5m if the contract is a two-year agreement. If Barry signs a three-year deal, then Everton will be obliged to shell out £2m to the Manchester club.

Ordinarily, clubs are reluctant to offer players in their thirties deals that go beyond a year and a three-year contract would certainly represent a deviation from the norm, but with Everton facing competition for Barry’s signature, they may be forced to offer him a deal that he cannot refuse.

Barry is expected to renew discussions with Everton later this week.
