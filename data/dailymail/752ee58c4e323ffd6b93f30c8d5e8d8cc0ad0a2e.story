A seven-year-old boy miraculously survived three nights stuck down a roadside service shaft in freezing temperatures of -10C after his faithful dog kept him warm.

Raul Kutliakhmetov was trying to rescue the stray dog when he slipped and fell - leaving them both stuck in three-metre deep roadside service shaft.

The boy and the dog were trapped inside the hole in for three days and nights - only managing to survive and avoid hypothermia by hugging each other for their body warmth. 

Man's best friend: Seven-year-old Raul Kutliakhmetov became trapped down a three-metre deep roadside service shaft while trying to rescue a stray dog near his home town of Bulgakovo in the Urals

Keeping each other alive: Raul and the dog huddled together to keep warm as temperatures in the shaft plummeted to -10C

A doctor who treated Raul told The Siberian Times: 'We are in awe at how he managed to survive, sitting inside there for three days. He told us that all that time his dog and him were clutching to each other trying to warm each other up.'  

More than 200 people joined the search to find Raul but it wasn't until rescuers heard the dog barking from the hole 72 hours later that they found the schoolboy.

Raul, who was left weak and exhausted by his ordeal, and the dog were then both pulled out of the shaft.

Speaking shortly after his rescue, Raul told the newspaper: 'I was coming back home from school and heard a strange noise. It was coming from inside the uncovered hole on the side of the road. I looked inside and saw my favourite dog down there'.

Raul said he had often played with the dog in his home village Bulgakovo, in Bashkiria in the Urals, so didn't want to leave him trapped in the shaft.

Large operation: More than 200 people joined the search to find Raul who was missing for three days

Saved: Doctors were amazed that Raul manged to survive in such freezing conditions

He then walked home to change clothes before returning to rescue the dog. But Raul then fell three metres down into the shaft and was unable to climb out.

He said: 'I wanted to save the dog and fell inside; I was calling but no-one heard me. I'm shivering a lot and my legs and arms and aching'.

The stone walls meant that Raul's calls couldn't be easily heard by rescuers.

But road engineer Maksim Belskiy heard about the missing boy on the radio and decided to check the service shafts around the area with a colleague.

They heard the dog barking and went in search of the noise. Then they discovered the boy and the dog huddled together.

The stray dog was also rescued alive but has since disappeared.
