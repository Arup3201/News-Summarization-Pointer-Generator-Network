A staggering 11 billion of them are sold every year in the UK alone – and they have been cited as one of the best reasons for visiting an Ikea store.

And now the furniture giant is planning a twist to its famous Kottbullar meatballs by introducing a vegan version from April.

The decision came about after heavy lobbying from animal rights activists PETA, which successfully convinced the Swedish home giants to add a meatless version to its restaurant menu.

 'PETA hears every day from shoppers calling for animal-friendly on-the-go options', said PETA Director Mimi Bekhechi. 

'Vegan snacks spare animals suffering and benefit human health, which earns IKEA a round of applause from PETA.' 

IKEA was caught up in the international food fraud scandal in 2013 when it emerged that its famous meatballs, made with beef and pork, actually contained a significant amount of horse meat.

Tens of millions of the meatballs were removed from sale in store restaurants and shops across Europe, including in the UK.

PETA's petition alone snagged 25,000 signatures, GrubStreet reported, and the outcry was enough for Ikea to confirm that the new meatballs will be available in their restaurants from Spring.

The website revealed that an Ikea representative told animal-rights group Viva! that the 'the veggie ball does not have any animal content and is therefore also suitable for vegans'.

Frozen bags for takeaway are being planned for later this year. 

Louise Bangee, IKEA UK Food Manager, said, 'At IKEA we want to offer healthy food choices that are delicious, sustainable and affordable for the many people, based on our Swedish identity. 

'We are currently developing our food range to provide options that meet the different preferences of our customers. 

'One of the exciting new products is a Veggie ball which will be launched in our stores from April and onwards. The veggie ball does not have any animal content in the ingredients. We will share more information about our new veggie balls nearer the time of the launch.'

Last spring MailOnline reported that the store decided to tinker with the family favourite by creating a green and vegetarian option.

Joanna Yarrow, head of sustainability for Ikea, said the company's meatballs were the most carbon-intensive dish on its menu. 

This is in part because of the beef and pork content but also because of the sheer volume it sells.

Miss Yarrow was reported to have told a sustainability conference: 'We are looking at all our food products from a sustainability perspective but specifically meatballs.'

Ikea's stores feature restaurants and also sell typical Swedish food, including the so-called Kottbullar meat balls.

Ikea estimates it has sold 11.6 billion Swedish meatballs and 1.2 billion hotdogs to its British customers since it opened in the UK in 1987.
