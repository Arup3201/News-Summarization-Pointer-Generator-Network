A cancer survivor who had all of the bones in her leg replaced with titanium has landed a job as a model.

Elesha Turner, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2013 and medics warned she may have to have her leg amputated.

But medics performed an operation which removed her femur bone, knee and the top part of the tibia, replacing them with titanium.

Miss Turner said: 'To think that I’ve gone from thinking I might lose my leg, to becoming a model, is just so surreal.

MissTurner, 20, was struck down with potentially life-threatening bone cancer which could have seen her leg amputated

'When the doctors told me I had cancer, it was just a nightmare - I don’t know anyone that’s been affected by it before, so it was so scary.

'When they told me about the surgery, I couldn’t believe it, it’s amazing what doctors can do.

'I had the surgery the day before my birthday, so I woke up on my birthday cancer free.

'I’d always thought I was too short to be a model, but I read about Models of Diversity - a company that specalise in disabled modelling - when I was reading an article about them in hospital.

'I feel so lucky to be alive, and to be living out one of my dreams.'

She added: 'When I was told about the operation I thought it was amazing that such an operation even existed.

'I was so worried about losing my leg so it was such a relief. The surgery was about six and a half hours and after the operation I remember seeing my leg when they were changing my dressing.

'I just thought my leg looked awful - they’d had to remove two of my thigh muscles too so it looked like someone had taken a great big bite out of it.

'I didn’t want to look at my leg, it was really thin.'

But after grueling rehabilitation she was soon back on her feet and was able to retrain her muscles.

She said: 'I started doing my rehab pretty much straight away. I had to learn to walk again which was very strange.

'I had to retrain my muscles to work in a certain way. It was a slow process as my prosthetic began loosening so I needed a second operation, but eventually I was mobile again.

'If I’m going out for an entire day I might need to use my wheelchair, and at the moment I rely on crutches, but I should be without them in the future.'

It was during her recovery that Elesha read an article about Models of Diversity - a company who campaign to get more diversity within the modeling industry.

Elesha said: 'After my surgery I was reading a magazine and spotted an article about Models of Diversity.

'My auntie and I thought it looked really interesting so I got in touch with Angel, the founder.

'I’m going to be one of the face of their disability campaign and I’m really excited - I can’t wait to challenge people’s perceptions.

'It’s crazy because before all this, I’d never even thought I could be a model as I’m too short, but it’s been amazing.'

Miss Turner first began experiencing symptoms of bone cancer on holiday in Egypt in June last year.

She said: 'I was in Egypt for ten days with my friend, and I woke up one morning with a stiff leg and pain in my knee.

'We’d been up dancing all night, going out clubbing, so I just thought it was that. It was more annoying than anything else.

'But when I came back I mentioned it to my doctor I was sent for an x-ray, I think I knew straight away that it was something serious.

'When I was eventually told I had bone cancer, I couldn’t believe it, it was my worst fear.

'I just burst into tears, and then I started the long journey to get better.'

'It’s weird because all of this has happened in the space of one year.

'I can’t quite believe how much my life has changed.

'I’m just happy to put all this behind me, and see what the future might bring.

“I’m also working with Bone Cancer Research Trust to raise some much needed awareness of bone cancer.'
