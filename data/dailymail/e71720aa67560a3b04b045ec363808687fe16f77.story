Female celebrities whose nude naked images were hacked are threatening to sue Google for $100 million for allegedly  'making millions from the victimization of women'.

Top Hollywood lawyer Marty Singer, who represents over a dozen of the women affected by the leak, has written a letter to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, accusing them of 'blatantly unethical behavior'.

The letter, which also reached executive chairman Eric Schmidt and the company's lawyers, alleges that Google failed 'to act expeditiously, and responsibly to remove the images'.

It compares their alleged lack of action to the NFL leadership's handling of the Ray Rice affair, Page Six reports.

Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Amber Heard, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Cara Delevingne were among the female celebrities affected by the leak when images were hacked from iCloud accounts. But it is unknown which women Singer represents.

The letter, exclusively seen by Page Six claims in knowingly accommodating, facilitating, and perpetuating the unlawful conduct, Google is making millions and profiting from the victimization of women'.

Singer claims his firm Lavely & Singer sent a notice to remove images four weeks ago - and several more since - but many of the images are still on Google sites BlogSpot and YouTube.

He writes: 'Google knows the images are hacked stolen property, private and confidential photos and videos unlawfully obtained and posted by pervert predators who are violating the victims' privacy rights… Yet Google has taken little or no action to stop these outrageous violations'

Actress Amber Heard, fiancée of Johnny Depp, is one of the victims - with over 50 pictures surfacing

The letter continues: 'Because the victims are celebrities with valuable publicity rights you do nothing - nothing but collect millions of dollars in advertising revenue … as you seek to capitalize on this scandal rather than quash it.'

Singer then compares Google's behavior to the NFL's handling of the 'Ray Rice affair' - an incident in which a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City elevator

'Like the NFL, which turned a blind eye while its players assaulted and victimized women and children, Google has turned a blind eye while its sites repeatedly exploit and victimize these women,' it says.

The latest wave of naked images are also alleged to feature  American goalkeeper Hope Solo (right) and Parks and Recreation actress Aubrey Plaza (left) was victim to the earlier leak

Actress Gabrielle Union said in a statement photos of her that were published online are genuine

Actress Vanessa Hudgens (left) and The Big Bang Theory star Kaley Cuoco have also been named as victims
