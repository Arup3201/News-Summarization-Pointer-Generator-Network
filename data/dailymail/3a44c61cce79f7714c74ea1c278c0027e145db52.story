London Mayor Boris Johnson is facing calls to ban ‘poor doors’ in upmarket blocks of flats, which force people on low incomes to use different entrances.

Developers in London are promising wealthy tenants they will not have to share their smart lobby entrances, courtyard gardens or secure parking with people living in flats classed as ‘affordable housing’.

The practice faces being banned in New York after a backlash and has sparked a political row in the UK with Labour condemning the covert ‘segregation’.

The problem stems from rules which are supposed to stop areas becoming ghettos for the very rich.

When planning permission is granted, developers are often told to set aside a set number of units for affordable housing.

From the outside, there is often no way of telling the more basic homes from the hi-spec apartments aimed at the super-rich.

But behind the façade, less well-off tenants are forced to enter through different doors and use separate bicycle racks, bins and post boxes.

Labour’s shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds told MailOnline: ‘I am strongly against this kind of segregation. There shouldn’t be separate doors for people living in affordable housing.

‘Many of the developers that I have been to haven’t had this distinction but I am deeply concerned that it is something happening in the UK.’

A furious row erupted in New York earlier this month when the city council approved a proposal by one of the largest real estate developers in the city to build in a 'poor door'.

It would force affordable housing tenants at a high-rise next to the Hudson River to walk through an entrance located in a back alley behind the building to enter, leaving the more prominent front entrance for tenants paying for nicer apartments.

New York Mayor Bill De Blasio moved to say it should be allowed, blaming the previous administration of Michael Bloomberg.

A spokesman said: ‘We fundamentally disagree with that approach, and we are in the process of changing it to reflect our values and priorities.

‘We want to make sure future affordable housing projects treat all families equitably.’

But according to a report in the Guardian, many developments in London are promising wealthy prospective tenants the same segregation.

It found a ‘bespoke entrance lobby ... with the ambience of a stylish hotel reception area’ at One Commercial Street.

But some residents are not able to use the main entrance with a 24/7 concierge and must instead use a side door near a trade entrance for Pret a Manger.

One development at Queen’s Park Place, north-west London, states ‘affordable homes will have a separate entrance’.

‘Affordable tenants will not have use of the main private residential entrance, private courtyard gardens or basement car and cycle parking. Services, including postal delivery and refuse storage are also divided.’

Judy Brown, had also expected to be able to get to her flat through the main entrance. 'I call it the posh door. I feel a little bit insulted. It's segregation.'

David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, said the revelations were ‘disturbing’ and asked: ‘Will Boris follow De Blasio and ban them?’

Green party London assembly member Darren Johnson said: 'This trend shows contempt for ordinary people, and is about developers selling luxury flats to rich investors who don't want to mix with local people.'
