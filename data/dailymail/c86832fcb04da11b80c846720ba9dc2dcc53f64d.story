The British might have a reputation for prim propriety but it seems that wasn't always the case, as a recently rediscovered cache of 18th century tiles reveals.

Kept under lock and key since their discovery in a Fleet Street pub in 1962, the reliefs offer an explicit peek into Georgian bedrooms and prove that far from being strait-laced, the 18th century was a considerably more risque place than previously thought.

Now the tiles are to go on display for the first time during a late night event at the Museum of London, although, as you might expect, it's strictly for those aged over 18.

Piquant: One of the set of eight erotic 18th century tiles discovered after a fire in a Fleet Street pub

Late London: City of Seduction gives visitors a peek into the bedrooms of London's historical inhabitants, with Romans rituals, ancient erotic sculpture and Georgian prostitutes among the stars of the show.

But even the raciest of Romans would find it hard to outdo the 18th century tiles, most of which offer viewers graphic depictions of couples enthusiastically indulging in the pleasures of the flesh.

'Erotic material – such as these relief 
tiles – was widely available in the 18th century, if one knew where to 
go and had the means with which to acquire it,' explains curator, Jackie Keily.

'For obvious reasons these tiles are not 
normally out on public display so we are pleased to show the complete 
set for the first time ever - just down the road from where they were discovered.'

Fragments: Some of the tiles are broken and in poor condition because of the fire

Raunchy: Although some show a moment of post-coital bliss, many more are extremely explicit

She is history's most famous lesbian, best known for a series of lyrical poems that speak of her mostly unrequited love for other women.

Now papyrus fragments discovered in the head of a mummy by Oxford University papyrologist Dr Dirk Obbink have revealed that the poet was a devoted sister as well an ardent lover.

One causing particular excitement among historians is a poem that speaks of her love for brother Charaxos who is gently teased for being in love with an Egyptian slave girl.

Touchingly, it also includes an exhortation to pray to [goddess] Hera 'so that Charaxos may return here, with his ship intact; for the rest let us leave it all to the gods, for often calm quickly follows a great storm.'

Whether Charaxos did indeed make it home to his sister, frustratingly, remains unknown. 

Unlike Keily, the descendants of the Georgian tile makers didn't appear to be quite so appreciative, with the reliefs hidden by layers of obscuring plaster during the Victorian period.

The tiles only came to light again after a fire at the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub in 1962 but, thanks to their explicit content, were swiftly bundled into a vault by the team that found them.

Now they have been uncovered once more and are currently being studied by historians, who believe that the tiles, found in an upstairs room, were used to decorate a fireplace.

Quite why the fireplace required such racy decoration is more of a mystery, although researchers believe they could have been intended for temporary use, put up when the room was being used as a brothel or as the haunt of a men's drinking club.

'London has always been a hotbed for the seductive, saucy and down-right sordid,' added Keily.

'From the bath-houses of Roman Londinium and the stews of medieval Bankside to the Restoration Rakes and Soho’s swinging sixties, this city has long traded in the currency of sex.'
