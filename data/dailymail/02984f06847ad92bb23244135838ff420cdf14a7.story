Schneiderlin scored the equaliser last Sunday as his side salvaged a 1-1 draw at home to Ipswich Town in the FA Cup third round. 

Sunday afternoon's game sees fourth-placed Southampton hoping to beat Manchester United and leapfrog them into third in the Premier League.

Just a single point separates the two sides in the table, with the Red Devils on 37 and the Saints on 36.

Southampton will be hoping to continue the good run of form that saw them collect 10 points from a possible 12 during the festive fixtures - beating Arsenal, Everton and Crystal Palace and drawing with Chelsea.
