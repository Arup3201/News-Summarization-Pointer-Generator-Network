A carer thought she would lose her eye after having an egg thrown at her from a passing car by a group of thugs.

Jacquie Crump, 55, who looks after Alzheimer's and dementia patients, was knocked over after being hit as she tried to cross the road in Blackwell, West Midlands.

She initially thought her eye had fallen out and only realised she had been egged when she spotted bits of shell on her clothes.

Anger: Jacquie Crump, 55, was left with a swollen black eye after the attack in Blackwell, West Midlands. She said she initially thought she had lost her eye in the attack - and she only realised what had happened when she saw egg shell on her clothes

Mrs Crump suffered a black eye in the attack but said the group could have caused her permanent damage.

'They need to be told how dangerous it is, it's not funny, it's not a joke,' she said.

'I was crossing and a car whizzed up. I stopped to let it pass. It was a gang of lads inside, there was loud music and they were laughing.

'One leaned through the side window and I leaned back and thought "he's going to throw a brick".'

Although she tried to take cover, the carer was hit in the face by the egg.

'I thought it was a brick that hit my eye and the stuff running down my cheek was my eye or blood. It was horrendous,' she said.

Anger: Dementia patients' carer Mrs Crump said that a pensioner could have been blinded if they had been targeted

She continued on her journey home after the attack - and was walked to her front door by a group of women who took care of her.

'They took me to my door. There are some bad apples but then you get someone so nice like that,' she said.

'My husband was very shocked. We were sat in the hospital and you could see the worry on his face.'

Doctors at Sandwell Hospital said she did not suffer any lasting damage in the attack but she will have to undergo further checks to make sure her vision is unaffected.

Mrs Crump said if the gang had targeted a pensioner the consequences could have been far more serious.

She said: 'I'm of a disposition where I suck it up and get on with it, but an elderly person could have been blinded.'

Police are now investigating the incident which happened at around 7.30pm last Friday. Anyone with information should contact Sandwell Police on 101.
