A BBC football pundit has apologised for saying two Premier League players had behaved ‘like a pair of girls’.

Former Liverpool and England striker Robbie Fowler was discussing the Tottenham-Chelsea game on Final Score on Saturday when he made the comment.

But his apology left fans claiming it was another example of the BBC’s obsession with political correctness.

During the game, Chelsea striker Fernando Torres and Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen had been involved in a series of clashes.

Fowler said: ‘Torres and Vertonghen were at each other’s throats all game, like a couple of girls – pulling each other’s shirts and pushing each other.’

Less than half an hour later, Fowler apologised on the live BBC1 show. ‘I made a comment about women’s football. I do apologise,’ he said.

‘I’m a big, big fan of Liverpool Ladies actually, who have a chance of winning the league tomorrow. I’ll be watching that.

'Anyone at home who was offended – I’m deeply sorry. I hope that’s the end of that.’

Within minutes, football fans used Twitter and online forums to criticise the decision to issue an apology.

Jones tweeted: ‘Robbie Fowler being made to apologise for saying 
Vertonghen and Torres were fighting “like girls” is an absolute joke. 
It’s political correctness gone mad.’

James Wilson added: ‘This is a massive low. Embarrassing.’

Another critic wrote: ‘What a ridiculous situation for the BBC to force an apology. For what? Describing an incident on a football pitch which certainly did look like two young girls fighting.’

But others said Fowler’s views were sexist and that it was right he apologised.

One wrote: ‘He was being misogynistic – regardless of whether or not it was unintentional – and so he’s been made to apologise.’

Last night the BBC denied it had asked Fowler to apologise for the remark and said the pundit decided to do it himself.

‘Robbie was concerned it may have caused offence, so decided to make an apology before the end of the show,’ it said.

Two months ago Fowler’s former club Liverpool released a list of words and phrases that they want to ban from the terraces, including ‘play like a girl’ and ‘don’t be a woman’.
