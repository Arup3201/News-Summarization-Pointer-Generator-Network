Harassment: Ruby Cooper, pictured outside court in May, has been convicted of breaking restraining orders banning her from contacting RBS employees

A former bank worker who was arrested for sending poison to RBS chief executive Stephen Hester has escaped jail after being found guilty of harassment.

Ruby Cooper breached a restraining order when she emailed the bank boss accusing him of conspiring against her and threatening to publicise his children's address.

She also wrote an aggressive letter to prosecuting barrister Simon Blackford, claiming he was guilty of perverting the course of justice.

Cooper, 52, was arrested in October last year after Mr Hester received a letter containing a vial of liquid which purported to be poison.

She subsequently sent the RBS boss an email in which she accused him of framing her, writing: 'I intend to flush you out Mr Hester, as I believe it is you behind this.

'You tried repeatedly to have me framed and fitted up over the past few years.

'There are two options: either you fabricated the letter or there is a nutter out there who may attack a member of your staff.

'I intend to publish the address of where that person can find your children and your wife and your new wife on 19 November. If you have something to fear you will resolve this with me pronto.

'If you were behind this, you will not settle this case with me, so by November 19 I will know.'

Cooper was arrested once again and charged with breaching a restraining order, and was found guilty by a jury earlier this year.

She has not faced any charges related to the alleged poison which was sent to Mr Hester, who stepped down as the bank's chief executive earlier this month.

Last month, Cooper emailed Mr Blackford, who represented the Crown Prosecution Service in her trial.

'Barrister and part-time judge Simon Blackford on behalf of the CPS in May 2013 perverted justice and allowed an abuse of process plus a few other dirty tricks to gain two convictions which he knows were gotten by the CPS by deceit.

'He knew that 78 crimes that I had reported had not been investigated properly and that the Met police tampered with evidence but did not stop the trial which he should have and yet this man is a judge.'

As he handed Cooper a suspended prison sentence at Snaresbrook Crown Court, judge Martin Zeidman said: 'I had hoped that since her conviction she would have learnt a lesson - I am afraid she has caused a real disappointment.

'I was worried about the mental state of this defendant as she had told me she had suffered from depression and there is no doubt she has had a hard life. She is a highly intelligent and articulate person but I fear that she is suffering from some real problems.

'Since the last hearing there has been more material sent to the court with some of it being long-winded and polite and some have been of a more aggressive style. For example, an email addressed to me and Mr Blackford makes reference to "Nazis" - I take no personal insult, as she apologised the next day in yet another email.

'Also in reference to Mr Blackford there is some scandalous defamation on the defendant's website and I would just like to comment, he has acted to the highest standards of the bar throughout proceedings.

'I have no doubt she is not prepared to cooperate and see a psychiatrist and despite her undoubted good characteristics she does have, I fear that she is now just outside the prison door.

'I am going to make a restraining order in the real hope that she complies - I make absolutely clear any further breach and she will go to prison.'

Grudge: Cooper had a vendetta against NatWest, owned by RBS, because of a run-in with an employee

Cooper was sentenced to three months in jail, suspended for two years, and is banned from contacting various public officials, including any director or former director of RBS, and anyone involved in her court case.

The defendant must also pay Â£3,500 costs for bombarding the CPS with emails and will be under supervision for two years.

Representing herself, Cooper said: 'My website is very emotive - I should imagine you have not had time to read all of it but every time I make a claim I show a document that proves they did pervert justice.

'The trial took place because the police would not help me. You have said that what I said is nonsense on the website and I have between 1994 and 2003 reported numerous crimes to the police which were never dealt with properly.'

Cooper has spent nearly 20 years campaigning against the bank after being 'freaked out' by a member of NatWest's call centre staff who allegedly took her home address from the bank's computers and paid her repeated visits even after she moved home.

Cooper, from Barnet in North London, continued to contact the bank about her concerns, and was convicted of harassing former chairman Sir David Rowland in 2000.

She was then banned from contacting any employees of NatWest or RBS, or any police officers involved in her case.

Privately educated Cooper, who has a degree in psychology and social anthropology from the University of Stirling, worked for NatWest - now part of RBS Group - from 1977-78.

She said she had a turbulent upbringing, with divorced parents living in different countries threatening to kidnap her.
