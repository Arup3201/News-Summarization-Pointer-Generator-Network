She is known for being one of Britain's most outspoken personalities.

Clinging onto that title, Katie Hopkins, 40, caused outrage on Twitter on Friday evening as she posted a series of messages criticising Kelly Clarkson's weight.

While watching the American singer, 32, perform on The Graham Norton Show, the 40-year-old tweeted: 'Jesus, what happened to Kelly Clarkson? Did she eat all of her backing singers?'

'That is not baby weight. It is fat': Hopkins' judgemental rant which led many fans to jump to Kelly's defence 

The sharp tongued columnist also added: 'Happily I have wide-screen. #grahamnorton'.

Sticking up for Clarkson, many users on the micro-blogging site pointed out to Hopkins that Kelly had become a mother for the first time just eight months ago.

However this information only fuelled Katie's rant and she continued: 'Darling, if you had a baby a year ago, that is not baby weight. It is fat. Quit calling it cute names to make yourself feel better.'

As more people took to Clarkson's defence, the former Celebrity Big Brother contestant then wrote: 'Baby weight, puppy fat, muffin top. We're so weakwilled we have to make up cute names for fat.

'Babies, puppies, muffins. Nope. Just fat love'.

Unimpressed with Hopkins' jibes, one person tweeted: 'No, @KTHopkins - it is never ok to slate someone for their weight or appearance. It says much more about you than it does about them.'

While someone else commented: 'I think raising her child is more important than hitting the gym. Kind of like how tweeting mean things is for you.'

'@KTHopkins Thankfully Kelly Clarkson probably doesn't have a clue who you are. You're a nobody compared to her. And that's what matters', were the words of another Twitter user.

Doing what she does best: Clarkson, 32, made an appearance on the show to promote her latest single

Following her tirade, on Saturday afternoon Hopkins safeguarded herself by asserting that she was free to say what she pleased on her social media profile.

She wrote: 'Let's remember boys and girls and haggard old bags, if you don't like what I say, you don't have to read it. My voice comes with choice.

'No one needs to agree with my views. Accepting we all think differently is the joy of life. Unless you are fat. Then clearly you're wrong.'

Earlier this week, Kelly opened up about her feelings about her appearance and how she copes with pressure on her looks.

During an interview on BBC Breakfast at the TV studios in Manchester, the American singer admitted that she doesn't really care what people think or say of her, as long as they like her work.

'I don't think that stops at our industry, I think that's in general,' Kelly said, of the criticism over women's bodies in the music business.

'And that's because the female form - even back in the days - the statues were of us. We're beautiful creatures. We're held in high esteem and so with that comes scrutiny.

'I don't know, I've always been confident in my talent and what I love to do, it's never really gotten me down. How I grew up, I've never been super concerned with [how I look].'

Sticking by her words: The former Celebrity Big Brother contestant is known for her brutal opinions

Disclaimer: On Saturday, Katie asserted that she is free to voice her controversial opinions on Twitter 

She went on: 'I'm always just worried that I've gotta sound great. I get destroyed if I suck somewhere. 

;It destroys me for like, a week. If I have a bad show and then you're like "oh God, they think I sound like that regularly". That's when I really go down the rabbit hole.'

The star - who rose to fame after winning the first series of American Idol back in 2002 - had previously also admitted that her strong character is down to her mother.

'I think we call that Texan,' Kelly joked, when asked about her 'bolshy' temperament. 'I've always been a confident person.'

The new mother - who gave birth to her first daughter with husband Brandon Blackstock last year - also admitted that it was she who put pressure on herself to get back to work after taking time off, rather than her record label.

'I was the person going 'when are we gonna put something out?', because I love working. I love being a mother as well, what's awesome is that I can do both.

'I make for a better parent and individual as long as I'm being productive,' the bubbly star added.  

Katie Hopkins has become famed for making controversial remarks and voicing her opinion on everything from benefits' claimants to people's weight.

The former Apprentice star became embroiled in a row with Loose Women star Coleen Nolan earlier this month after she called out the TV personality on posting cruel jibes about her sister Linda.

Hopkins, 40, posted vile messages about Linda on Twitter when the former singer appeared on Celebrity Big Brother last year. 

On an episode of Loose Women starring Hopkins earlier this month, Coleen kept her cool as she took the chance to confront Hopkins about her nasty comments.

Explaining that her sister was a breast cancer survivor, she told the controversial star: 'When my sister was in Big Brother you constantly, day in, day out, went on about how "fat" she was', she said. 

'[Saying],"I wish she'd put her fat arm away, I wish she'd pick up her very droopy breasts. She looks like an old person that smells of urine."

'As a family, that was very hard. Can you imagine someone saying that about you?'

However, Hopkins - who was runner-up to Katie Price during the CBB final two weeks ago - refused to back down.

She refused to apologise and retorted: 'I get insults every day – I accept what people throw at me.

'If you put yourself out there on TV you have to expect people won’t like you.' 

It came after Police Scotland said they were looking into an insulting tweet from the provocative TV star about Pauline Cafferkey - the British nurse who contracted Ebola.

In December last year, officers said they were investigating posts by Hopkins which called the nurse a ‘sweaty Glaswegian’ and referred to Scots as ‘Jocks’.

She wrote: ‘Little sweaty jocks, sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glaswegians just isn’t cricket.’ 

Her remarks caused outrage on Twitter, with many accusing her of racism, while journalist Piers Morgan branded her a ‘repulsive creature’.

The star also caused controversy during her TLC documentary called 'My Fat Story' in which she put on four stone before attempting to lose it all again to prove it was possible to lose weight. 

During the show, Hopkins met with a group of five women in London who all work independently as plus-size activists or diet bloggers, so that she could hear opposing views on her claims that 'fat people are lazy'.

However, Hopkins quickly upset some of the group and size acceptance campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki stormed out of the room to call the police.

She accused the outspoken star of 'hate crimes' after Hopkins told her: 'I’m looking at you and I’m making an assessment that it is not healthy to carry that much weight on your knees.'

She continued: 'I just don’t believe you’re healthy in that state.

Ms Szrodecki responded: 'Do you not realise where you’re going with this? This is actually to do with a hate crime,' before calling the police. 

Last year, Hopkins also attacked Benefit Street's White Dee in a furious television debate in which she called her 'the patron saint of drug users and drop outs'.

She also famously got embroiled in a debate about children's names on This Morning with Holly Willoughby.

Hopkins revealed that she would not let her children play with anyone called 'Tyler, Chardonnay, Charmaine or Chantelle' after claiming she wouldn't like those sorts of children'.

And in 2013 - when Hopkins posted a tweet joking about Scottish life expectancy in the wake of a Glasgow helicopter crash that killed ten people - people wanted her off their television sets.

She cause outrage by tweeting: 'Life expectancy in Scotland is 59.5. Goodness me. That lot will do anything to avoid working until retirement.'

She also once said that ginger babies were: 'Like a baby. Just so much harder to love,' and famously said she would never employ an obese person.
