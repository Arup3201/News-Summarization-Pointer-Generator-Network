A rookie New York cop attacked by a hatchet-wielding maniac has taken his first steps unassisted as he continues a slow but steady recovery from his hospital bed.

Officer Kenneth Healey, 25, is believed to have taken a few steps around his hospital room without the aid of a walker.

The rookie NYPD officer was rushed to hospital after being bludgeoned in the back of the head by Zale Thompson last Thursday, in an unprovoked attack targeting himself and three other officers he was with.

Police sources have said Officer Kenneth Healey is now improving and his condition 'progressing nicely'

The New York Post cited police sources as saying his condition was now improving.

The source said: 'He’s progressing nicely. He’s getting stronger and better. Every day he has a better frame of mind — and his spirits are getting higher.

'He wants to get better so he can go back to being a police officer like his dad.'

A number of fundraising sites have also emerged online for visitors to donate or simply pass on messages of goodwill.

Meanwhile, a chilling picture has been released showing Officer Healey and his three colleagues in Queens, taken seconds before they were ambushed.

Officer Kenneth Healey, 25, and his three comrades are all smiles in a portrait taken by Dominick Williams last Thursday afternoon.

Mr Williams spotted the officers and asked them to stand for a picture. Seconds later, Zale Thompson ran up to the cops - who where standing against a wall in Jamaica, Queens - and started swinging a sharp hand ax.

Mr Williams says he scrambled for safety as the officers wrestled with Thompson. He hacked Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, in the arm before smashing Healey in the skull.

The other officers opened fire, killing Thompson but also accidentally shooting and gravely wounding a bystander who was caught in the crossfire. 

Mr Williams' camera captured the frantic aftermath of the attack. 

Officer Healey - who had just four months on the job - can be seen laying face down on the sidewalk - a bloody gash in his head.  

Another officer can be seen tending to his fallen comrade, holding a cloth over the gushing wound in his head.

Officer Healey was taken to the hospital in critical condition, but is expected to survive the injury.

The pictures also capture Thompson dead on the sidewalk.

His body is face up with the hatchet, still in his had, laid across his chest.

Mr Williams estimated that the officers fired seven shots. 

NYPD top brass has called the attack 'an act of terrorism.' Thompson was a self-radicalized Muslim extremist who had an interest in ISIS beheadings. 

His family described him as a 'recluse' with mental health problems.
