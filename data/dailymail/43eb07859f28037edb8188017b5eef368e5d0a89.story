Heavy snow has caused more damage to the crumbling Colosseum in Rome putting the iconic monument under even more strain.

The damage has meant the famous attraction has had to close its doors to the public, disappointing thousands of tourists.

Other buildings in the historic walled town of Urbino have also started to deteriorate under the weight of snow.

Exceptional weather: Experts have been surveying the damage to the Colosseum this week and are trying to work out ways to stop further movement

About 7,000 people a day visit the Colosseum - a 50,000-seat amphitheatre completed in 80 AD and used for gladiator contests and mock sea battles in the Italian capital - paying 12 euros each for a ticket.

It is already in dire need of restoration and is due to undergo a long-delayed 25million euro restoration this year.

In December slabs of ancient lime plaster fell from the 2000-year-old attraction on Christmas Day and Boxing Day putting staff on high alert for more falling debris.

However, the latest erosion has been caused by an exceptionally large amount of snow this year, the weight of which has put pressure on the building.

Freezing temperatures led to ice 
forming on the walls of the monument, expanding and pushing the external
plaster masonry causing pieces to crumble.

If the pieces fall from a certain height they could pose a risk to visitors.

Locals say this year has been the coldest in Italy for 30 years. When the snow fell earlier this month the city ground to a halt as 
buses struggled to climb icy hills and authorities accustomed to a warm 
climate fought to cope.

As well as the Colosseum, visitors were also stopped from entering the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, 
the former home of Rome's ancient emperors, over fears they could slip 
on ice.

Rome had not seen heavy snow in 26 years. The last substantial snowfalls in Rome 
were in 1985 and 1986, though there have been other cases of lighter 
snow since then, including in 2010.

Experts have been surveying the damage to the Colosseum this week and are trying to work out ways to stop further movement.

Under strain: Heavy snow has caused extensive damage to the medieval walled town of Urbino and further deteriorated the Colosseum in Rome which is badly in need of repair

Rossella Rea, archaeologist and 
superintendent of the Colosseum, told CNN: 'Tests and evaluation of the 
damage is still ongoing, especially on the second level of arches.'

The building is expected to re-open to the public on Thursday.

David Pickles, senior architect at English Heritage, said the damage was an extreme version of the natural wear and tear buildings face during everyday weather.

Meanwhile, in Urbino, two convents have had structural problems following the bad weather and the roof of the Church of the Capuchins has also caved in.

The town's cathedral is also shut following water damage and there are concerns about some historic homes which have wooden joists and delicate roofs might now need additional support.

Italian environmental group Legambiente has frequently raised the alarm about the venue's precarious state.

It claims car fumes and vibrations from a nearby subway are damaging its travertine exterior and brick and tufa interior.
