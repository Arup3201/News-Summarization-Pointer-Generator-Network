The world's first ever airport terminal for animals is set to be built at JFK Airport in New York City, US.

Humorously called 'The Ark,' the facility is set to be open for business early 2016, and is scheduled to cost around £32 million ($48 million). 

A 30-year lease has been agreed between The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey with Ark Development for the projected 178,000 square feet development.

The facility at JFK Airport is expected to cater for domestic animals, as well as farm animals

Around 110 jobs are set to be created by the construction, with estimates of £70 million ($108 million) to be generated in revenue over the 30-year period. 

The Ark will provide both airside and landside services to board, kennel, quarantine, import, export and transport large and small animals.

There will also be a Paradise 4 Paws kennels, an aviary and a veterinarian, all designed to relax the animals before they fly out.

Additional services will include transportation in dedicated climate controlled vehicles from aircraft, terminals, cargo facilities and other airport locations. 

A livestock export handling system designed by Professor Temple Grandin, the leading authority on livestock movement, will allow for the safe and efficient handling of cattle, goats, pigs and sheep from truck to aircraft.

Families will now be able to send their loved pet of for some pampering in their very own airport terminal

Cliff Bollman, who is an architect with Gensler, one of the firms tasked with the design, said: 'Gensler is accustomed to designing airports with an eye to fostering well-being for people, yet The Ark at JFK posed a unique design challenge for us: to create a place that could ease and simplify the sometimes complex process of transporting animals by plane. 

'For the animals who pass through The Ark, as well as the people who own them, air travel can be stressful and confusing.' 

He added that, 'aligning the needs of quarantine with kenneling and elevating the experience for animals and their owners, our design team sought to create a comfortable, healthy environment for them all.'
