These are the horrific injuries suffered by a greyhound which was dumped by the roadside covered in dog food after being used as bait for illegal dogfights.

Bentley was left to die in a quiet country lane with puncture wounds over his body, including deep cuts to his neck and wounds to his legs.

The five-year-old greyhound was found on the border between West Boldon and Sunderland on Monday night with biscuits attached to his collar and his body smothered in dog food. 

This led to suspicions that he was used as bait in a dog fight and another animals may have attacked him.

He was taken to the King's Road Veterinary Practice in Sunderland by freelance dog warden Lisa Scott and is now recovering after emergency surgery.

'Everyone is absolutely disgusted by what has happened to this dog. It looks like Bentley was used for dog fighting,' said Miss Scott.

'It appears someone has set another dog onto him. This other dog was probably kept starving and has been attracted by the smell of the food smothered over Bentley and the biscuits around his neck. He has then been attacked badly and suffered terrible injuries.' 

Bentley is now recovering at the home of volunteer Beverley Reed, from South Shields.

She said: 'Bentley is such a gentle and lovely dog. When I first brought him home, he was unsettled at first but he had a good sleep the next night.

'He is also eating well now and is a lot brighter. The vets have been fantastic in helping him to recover from such nasty wounds.

'There is still some way to go but he's getting there.'

Northumbria Police investigated the incident and said there is no evidence of a criminal offence. 

Bentley's ordeal prompted dog lovers from across the region and other parts of the country to donate more than £1,500 to help towards his care. 

Susan Oliver, 42, of Wardley, said: 'Bentley's injuries were horrific and made me sick to the stomach. I can't believe someone would do this to the poor animal.

'Those responsible should be found and punished severely.'

Mark Brown, manager of MyPetStop, said: 'Everyone has been horrified by what happened. We can't believe Bentley has suffered such injuries. So we decided to give him a big treat.

'Our main business is boarding and looking after pets, but we also have a grooming salon and hydrotherapy pool.

'Once Bentley is feeling better we will invite him here, give him a bath, groom him, give him a swim in the pool and offer him treats from our shop.

'We want to show that there are still people out there who care for animals.'

Leanne Plumtree, RSPCA spokesman for the North East, said: 'We haven't had any calls to our cruelty line about Bentley the greyhound, but it sounds like he was in a terrible state when he was found.

'If anyone has any specific information about Bentley they can contact us on the RSPCA's inspector appeal line 0300 123 8018 and leave a message for RSPCA chief inspector Michelle Charlton.'

A police spokesman said: 'The dog has been treated and it is believed no criminal offences have been committed.'
