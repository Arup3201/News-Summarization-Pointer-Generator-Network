Andrew Shanahan weighed 16st 5lb after too many sandwiches, crisps and lager

In 2011 I took a selfie which saved my life. It’s a truly horrible image showing the full extent of my 16st 5lb body, featuring a distended gut topped with the sort of boobs that could make a pre-teen girl wince with envy.

I took the guttie to send to a friend as a laugh, but when I contemplated the image the full extent of my issues with weight hit me. I had to change.

I had no idea that the mission would ultimately include thousands more gutties, the launch of a new magazine called Man V Fat and even gained support from Jamie Oliver.

My weight had initially suffered when I was working hard on building my business and balancing the demands of being a dad to two lovely boys, while trying to squeeze a bit of a life in at the sides.

The stress of work was leading to a procession familiar to many working types where I trudged from bed, to desk, to sofa and back to bed.

My food choices were geared towards comfort and the temporary alleviation of tiredness. My four food groups were sandwiches, crisps, chocolate and lager.

All of this was playing havoc with my health – I had developed atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to a higher chance of having a stroke), I no longer played sport and my confidence was in tatters.

Something about the guttie cut through all of that though – it left me with nowhere to run – I knew I had to change.

The thing that I wasn’t prepared for is that according to the weight loss industry: men don’t diet. No matter how hard I looked I couldn’t find anything that was aimed at helping me: a normal, fat bloke who just wanted to get some no-nonsense advice about how to lose weight. 

The diets, the magazines, the weight loss
 groups were all women only. What I saw was an industry that has simply 
jettisoned the notion that men – half of the market – might want to lose
 weight.

The gut selfie that triggered his weight loss (left) and another as he began to lose it. He blamed his 16st 5lb frame on 'too many sandwiches, crisps and lager'

He said: I lost' weight slowly, by making more and more healthy choices. I learned about nutrition and the science behind weight loss.'

The Diet Coke Man is a man precisely because the notion of a man dieting is anathema to the weight loss industry. I did join several weight loss classes, but as the token man in a class of 30 women there’s only so many times you can hear about how menstruation affects your weekly weigh-ins before realising that you’re not the target market.

What I learned is that rather than diet, men get fit. Instead of advice about what foods to cut down on and how to make really tasty, healthy food I was bombarded with messages about how I could get a six pack, build bigger arms and perfect my deadlift form.

All of this wildly overlooked the fact that at 40 per cent body fat I was far more likely to be drinking a six-pack than seriously contemplating developing one.

I began to wonder how many other men out there were being led down the same cul-de-sac that I was and finding that their hopes to simply shift a bit of weight were being met with the unrealistic expectation that they tone up, rather than slim down. 

All of this wouldn’t be such an issue if 
the scale of men’s weight problems wasn’t so vast. In the UK alone we 
have over 20.4 million men who are overweight or obese. Some figures 
suggest that by 2030 over half of all men in the UK will be obese.

Today, he weighs 13st and having discovered on his weight loss journey there are few resources to help the 'average bloke' lose weight, decided to launch a free weight loss magazine

This is the single biggest public health issue that we can actually do something about – millions of lives can be saved and immeasurably improved simply by providing more support. Every year the NHS is faced with a £6 billion bill for illnesses related to weight – more than the cost of illnesses related to smoking and drinking.

Lord McColl, a former professor at Guy’s Hospital, has warned that the obesity epidemic will shortly bankrupt the NHS. Despite all of this we continue to leave men dangling in the wind. 

I lost weight slowly, by making more and more healthy choices. I learned about nutrition and the science behind weight loss. 

What stunned me was that it was so 
simple! How could an entire industry have been built up around the 
indisputable scientific fact that you lose weight by expending more 
energy than you take in?

And yet there it was – a baffling array 
of approaches, products, quick-fixes, no-effort cures and out-and-out 
quackery – but still I couldn’t find anything to help men.

The first issue of Man V Fat is out on May 5th. The magazine was a crowdfunded project

Once I’d lost nearly 50lb I felt like a new man – I was no longer embarrassed of my gutties and I had started to enjoy yoga and boot camps at my local gym. I couldn’t ignore the fact that men were being abandoned though and so a new business was born: Man V Fat – a free digital magazine that supports and champions weight loss in men.

I wasn’t sure if there would be enough public demand for it so I set up a crowdfunding project and when we cruised past our £9,000 target and got support from Jamie Oliver, the National Obesity Forum and the British Dietetic Association, I realised that this was a project whose time had come. We’ve already had thousands of subscribers before the first issue has even launched – you can get your free copy simply by adding your details here www.eepurl.com/M_NXf.

The first issue is out on May 5th and it contains all you need to lose weight if you are a man and avoid ever having to take a guttie of your own
