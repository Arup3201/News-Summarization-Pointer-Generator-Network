Remorse: Sasha Long, 36, crashed his go cart into a crowd during a soap box derby event leaving two children in critical condition

A man who left two children fighting for their lives after crashing into them in a go gart while taking part in a soap box derby has told how he said he feels 'terrible'.

Sasha Long, 36, was at the wheel of a ‘canoe-type’ homemade racer when he lost control and slammed into a crowd of spectators, injuring seven, including the two three-year-old children.

The boy and girl, who were cousins, are said to have suffered serious head injuries after the accident in Warbleton, East Sussex. They remain in critical conditions in South London hospitals, according to Sussex Police.

Speaking from his farmhouse home in a nearby village a visibly distressed Mr Long told of his sorrow for the injured children and adults.

He said: 'I feel terrible towards the families of the injured people, especially the children who are still in critical care.

'I do not want to say anything else at the moment without first consulting the families of the children.

'I am so very tired.'

Mr Long was taking part in the annual ‘Soap Box Derby’ hosted by the local Black Duck Pub, an event open to adults as well as children.

Witnesses say he lost control at the first corner after going over some hay and mud, before careening into a crowd of people stood behind safety straw bale barriers.

The girl, from Hailsham, East Sussex, was flown by air ambulance to King’s College Hospital in London, whiule the boy, from Herstmonceux, East Sussex, was airlifted to St Georges Hospital in South London.

Mr Long received a minor knee injury and his 60-year-old mother, who was travelling on the back of the cart, is thought to have broken her hand.

Around 700-1000 people had gathered 
along the closed off road for the third annual race, which saw 40 people
 enter with their homemade carts along the 500yd stretch of closed-off 
road.

Other spectators 
injured included a 20-year-old woman, a four-year-old boy and a man aged
 37 who all suffered leg and arm injuries.

The
 terrible crash happened on the 37th run of the day, at the very end of 
the first corner. After the crash, the event was immediately cancelled.

Landlord Nikki Kinnell, who organised 
the ‘Church Hill Challenge’ event with husband Gary for the third year 
running, said they were devastated by the accident.

She said: 'We’re very sorry that this accident happened. Our thoughts are with the families.

'We had been racing all day and the accident happened after 36 carts had gone down without incident.

'We had all the proper safety measures in place, marshals and huge straw bales we kept asking people to stay behind.

'It was an accident. Accidents happen, but this is a really bad one.

'We’re all devastated.'

A local, who witnessed the crash, said: 'It’s not like anyone was to blame really.

'You can’t blame people who got hurt, even if they may have been stood where they were told they shouldn’t.

'It certainly wasn’t the driver’s fault.

'The day was meant to be a bit of fun, nothing dangerous or risky.

'What a tragedy. I hope the little ones are pull through.'

However one local slammed the organisers over the lack of safety. 

Valerie Patience, 72, who went to watch the race with her husband Brian, 74, queried why St John Ambulance crews were not on standby at the event.

She said: 'I don't think it was properly organised for safety, someone should have been down there and said "You can't stand right on the lane, you have to go behind the hay bales".

'I have got grandchildren and there is no way they would have been there on that bend.'

Describing the carnage of the crash she added: 'It was absolutely dreadful with the two little ones getting hurt.

'A woman, either an aunt or a mother, ran with the little girl in her arms from the bottom to the top of the hill.

'The little boy was taken up on a quad bike to the pub.'

Mrs Patience said the kart track had been lined with hay bales but on the corner where the crash happened the young children were standing in front of the bales and sitting on top of them.

'We stood behind the bales for safety but on that bend they had come in front of the bales so there was no protection whatsoever,' she said.

'The kart skidded and went right into them.

'It was just terrible, after that other people were calling for first aiders in the crowd, they didn't realise how bad it was.'

Sussex Police said: 'Police have 
carried out initial enquiries and have spoken to the event organisers 
and witnesses, and are also keeping in contact with the victims and 
families involved.

'We are 
also supplying information to Wealden District Council so that they can 
establish the full circumstances and decide what action should be taken,
 as the road was closed at the time.'

Crowds: Around 700-1000 people had gathered along the closed off road for the third annual race, which saw 40 people enter with their homemade carts along the 500yd stretch of closed-off road

The terrible crash happened on the 37th run of the day, at the very end of the first corner. After the crash, the event was immediately cancelled.

The
 event featured 38 entrants from the local area, competing to see whose 
homemade kart could travel the furthest and fastest down the hill 
outside the pub, around the corner where the accident took place and up 
the other side.

Around 1,000 people gathered to watch 
the race, which was marked out by hay bales and raised money for a 
prostate cancer charity.

Videos
 have emerged on social media of other karters crashing into hedgerows 
on the same bend, but the drivers and passengers in each case appear 
unhurt.

Nikki Kinnell, who 
runs the Black Duck pub with her husband Gary and organised the said: 
'We are both really sad that this has happened and our thoughts are with
 those injured. We have held the event for three years without any major
 incidents.

'The children are in a bad way but they are improving and showing good signs, they are awake and talking to their parents.'

A boy and a girl, both aged three, are in a critical condition in hospital after a man 'lost control of his homemade buggy' as he raced downhill during an event in Warbleton, East Sussex (file picture from previous year's event)

Five other spectators, including a four-year-old boy, were also injured after the pedal-driven go-kart ploughed into the crowd on Bank Holiday Monday during an event organised by the Black Duck Pub (pictured)

The
 race, which still had three entrants left to run, was stopped after the
 accident as air ambulances landed on the field behind the pub and 
paramedics attended.

Mrs 
Kinnell declined to say who the family involved was but said they had 
visited the pub on a number of occasions and had taken part in the derby
 itself in previous years.

A Sussex police spokesman said: 'We have carried out initial inquiries and have spoken to the event organisers and witnesses.

'We are also keeping in contact with the victims and families involved.

'We
 are also supplying information to Wealden District Council so that they
 can establish the full circumstances and decide what action should be 
taken, as the road was closed at the time.'
