The major high street banks have all been found to be among the worst available when it comes to customer satisfaction, a survey by Which? has found.

Santander and Halifax scored the lowest 
results with just 46 per cent and 48 per cent of their customers saying 
they were satisfied - well below the average score of 62 per cent.

Also performing poorly were the Bank of 
Scotland, which scored 49 per cent, RBS at 50 per cent, Lloyds at 51 per
cent, Barclays at 54 per cent, NatWest at 56 per cent and HSBC with 60
per cent.

Not satisfied: The Which? consumer survey has revealed Santander and Halifax scored the lowest results for customer satisfaction

The findings show just how reluctant customers are to swap banks. The bottom eight banks - starting with Santander as the worst, followed by Halifax, Bank of Scotland, RBS, Northern Rock, Lloyds TSB, Barclays and NatWest - have 75 per cent of all UK current accounts.

The consumer group Which? asked its 
members over the last year how satisfied they were with the services 
provided by 30 financial brands.

Top of the table for customer satisfaction were First Direct, The One Account and the Co-Operative Bank with 86 per cent, 80 per cent and 79 per cent respectively.

1) Find a current account that provides what you need and charges fees you are prepared to pay. Our MoneyMail page can give you advice.

2) Ensure that you switch accounts on a date that suits you. Avoid dates in the month that come just before large standing orders or direct debits are due to go out as you may find payments are missed. Confirm the switch date with your current and new bank.

3) Tell your employer about the switch immediately, to avoid any delay in receiving your salary.

4) Compile a complete list of all direct debits and standing orders. Make sure when these are being transferred to your new account that none has been missed, and that previously cancelled payments have not been re-started.

5) Once the new account is activated, check everything. Report any problems immediately.

Customers were asked how satisfied they are with their current account, savings account, credit card and mortgage provider for the main UK financial service providers and whether they would recommend them to a friend.

Members were also asked to rate their bank on aspects of their services including experience of customer service, how good banks are at resolving problems, how knowledgeable bank staff are and whether banks keep their customers informed about charges and the best deals.Savings account customers were the most unhappy with many frustrated that loyalty does not seem to pay and complaining they have to check up on interest rates and switch accounts to get the best deals.Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director, said: 'Consumers are constantly being let down when it comes to customer service.

'This is not good enough, we want to see fundamental changes in the culture of banking and a return to banking for customers, not bankers.

'Our survey shows that those banks that go the extra mile to keep their customers happy are rated far higher than banks who may offer slightly better products or interest rates.'All banks need to start putting customers first.'

Scoring low: The Halifax also fared badly in the poll of how satisfied customers are
