While the universal popularity of selfies is now indisputable, some could be forgiven for thinking the latest photo trend in Japan won't catch on.

The latest bizarre craze to come out of Japan is a fascination with dogs' backsides - with owners sharing pictures of their pets' butts in a bid to cheer up each others' lives.

The snaps of man's best friend from the rear reportedly started with a bizarre online posting from Twitter user Kazue.

She posted a snap of her shiba inu dog Hana-chan, a dog native to Japan, which she claimed melted 'all of my worries away'.

The trend apparently started when a Twitter user claimed a photo of her pet dog's bum cheered her up

The craze is sweeping the nation, with artwork of dogs' bums now on sale and dog bum beauty contests held

Kazue's snap of her dog's rear end included the message: 'I printed out this shiba butt and stuck it on the wall of my room. All of my worries have since melted away.'

The picture was not only shared by other users who seemed to agree it had a calming influence, but it also made its way into mainstream media.

One commenter said: 'The sheer majesty of this pupâ€™s back end dwarfs many of the tiny troubles we encounter in our daily lives.

'How is it that something can be both so adorable and so veritably grand?'

Other tweets included such messages as: 'What a beautiful butt picture! I feel so refreshed!' and 'standing against this lovely sky, this is a masterpiece'.

Others included 'this butt is too cuuute' and 'what a lovely vantage point!'

Not content with just one dog butt, others are now sharing snaps of their dogs' backsides.

Viewers' comments on the dog bum images include 'I feel so refreshed' and 'what a lovely vantage point'.

Fans of the dog butt pictures claim they are relaxing and cheer up those who view them

There have been numerous comments in response by Japanese internet users extolling the aesthetic virtues of dog butts.

Most recently the craze has involved dog butt beauty contests as well as framed pictures on sale in art shops.

Not to be outdone, Japanese cat lovers claim they have known about the relaxing advantages of cat butt pictures for some time, and there is even a range of best selling cat rear end trophies that are hung on walls.

The cat pictures were created by Popolare, an accessory maker who runs her own shop retailing natural gemstones.

She found her business in cat rears took off when she started looking at alternative handicraft projects.

She made her framed felted bottoms in three designs, each measuring about 12.8cm tall (including the tail) by 7.5cm wide, and all three designs were sold out straight away.

It is said looking at the images of dog's backsides gives off a calming influence and brings joy

The trend follows on from the much publicized 'hamster butt' trend which took over Japan earlier this year
