Ministers have been condemned as ‘shameful’ and ‘devious’ after they blocked international efforts to ban plastic bags.

David Cameron once claimed his government would be the ‘greenest ever’, and signed up to efforts to reduce the number of throwaway bags handed out at tills.

But it has emerged that ministers have been secretly working behind the scenes in Brussels to kill off controls.

Italy had brought in controls in 2011 after study found 73% of man-made waste on coast was plastic bags

UK blocked the ban citing EU law, despite the dangers plastic bags cause to wildlife in Britain and abroad

They have used the EU legal system to overturn the Italian government’s ban on thin plastic bags in their own country.

In 2011, Italy brought in controls on plastic bags following studies which found that they made up 73 per cent of the man-made waste settling on the sea bed around its coast.

But the UK claims this is illegal under European law. Its intervention has stopped the measure in its tracks – and prevented other European governments from adopting similar schemes.

Britain’s decision has apparently put the commercial interests of plastic bag manufacturers ahead of the need to tackle litter, blight and harm to wildlife.

It contradicts pledges made by Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg dating back to February 2008, when they offered their support to the Daily Mail’s ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign.

Italian ministers and environmental campaigners are furious about the role played by the Government.

Italy’s environment minister, Andrea Orlando, said: ‘The bags are a serious problem, above all at sea, and it is astounding that Britain, which is serious about the environment and has a seafaring tradition going back centuries, does not want to defend the seas from plastic pollution which suffocates and kills many marine animals.’

The Daily Mail campaigned against the use of plastic bags for five years and it was backed by Cameron and Clegg

Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who at 
one time was an adviser on green issues to the Prime Minister, condemned
 the Government’s failure to tackle ‘plastic poison’ bags.

He said: ‘It is bad enough that the Government’s rhetoric on this issue is miles away from any meaningful action, but using EU bureaucracy to stop other nations doing the right thing is just shameful. The sheer deviousness of this latest move will be surprising even to cynics amongst us.’

Dr Sue Kinsey, of the Marine Conservation Society, said: ‘It seems extraordinary that a government that has badged itself as the greenest ever should seek to stop a ban on carrier bags.

‘It seems hypocritical to agree on the one hand that something needs to be done to reduce the number of carrier bags given out in the UK and on the other to block a ban on bags in Italy.’

The department for environment, food and rural affairs, run by Tory secretary of state Owen Paterson, and the business department, run by Lib Dem Vince Cable, could not agree on who was responsible for blocking the ban.

Eight billion plastic bags are issued in the UK - more than six billion are used in England

Both claimed they were simply trying to uphold European packaging laws and protect the interests of UK manufacturers.

A Government spokesman said: ‘While we are determined to tackle the blight 
caused by discarded carrier bags, the proposed Italian scheme is illegal
 under EU packaging laws.’

But many countries have introduced charges for bags in an attempt to cut down on their use.

The Welsh government introduced a 5p charge on plastic bags in October 2011, reducing the number handed out at tills by 90 per cent and raising tens of thousands of pounds for good causes.

Northern Ireland brought in its own 5p charge earlier this year, while the Scottish Parliament is expected to follow suit.

Dr Kinsey said: ‘Although this block came from “Britain” or the “UK” I am sure that Wales and Northern Ireland – which already have bag levies and Scotland which is considering one – would not agree with this position.

‘Yet again England is left isolated on this issue as the only part of the UK not to be doing anything to reduce the number of bags.

‘Perhaps they should get their own house in order before interfering with others.’ Ministers have stood by while the number of plastic bags given out at tills in England has risen dramatically over the past two years.

Currently, around eight billion single use bags are issued by stores across the UK each year. England accounts for 6.77billion of these.

The majority end up in landfill where it is estimated they can take up to 1,000 years to rot away, while others are discarded to blight streets, seas and the countryside.

Once in the environment, they are a threat to birds, dolphins, whales and turtles.

The Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign, launched in 2008, won the backing of politicians from all parties as well as countryside and clean-up groups. At the time, Marks & Spencer took the lead by introducing a 5p charge across the country, cutting billions of bags and raising cash to clean up green spaces and beaches.

Earlier this year, leaders from Keep Britain Tidy, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Marine Conservation Society and Surfers Against Sewage met environment minister Lord de Mauley to call for action to introduce charges in England.

But he brushed their concerns off, and promised no action beyond monitoring how the schemes work in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
