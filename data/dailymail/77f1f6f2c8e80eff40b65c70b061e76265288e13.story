A fresh revolt may be brewing within party ranks but it was all smiles last night as MPs put on a show of unity at the Conservative Party summer ball.

The guestlist for the event, hosted by exclusive Phillips de Pury & Company auction house in London's Victoria, was a veritable who's who of the Tory elite.

But behind the jolly handshakes and practiced smiles simmered a swirl of resentment after the Prime Minister refused to guarantee a referendum over Europe and made clear he wants Britain to stay in the EU.

Bashful PM: Mr Cameron appeared keen not to be seen as he swept into the event behind the tinted windows of his ministerial limousine

Happy side: Even embattled Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has repeatedly faced calls for his resignation over his relationship with Rupert Murdoch appeared to be enjoying himself. As did Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke, right

Mr Cameron appeared keen not to be seen as he swept into the event behind the tinted windows of his ministerial limousine.

Yesterday he told MPs that he wants
to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels but made clear that 
he thinks Britain’s destiny lies in Europe.

But guests appeared to have put their party's troubles to one side as they hobnobbed late into the night.

Even embattled Culture Secretary 
Jeremy Hunt, who has repeatedly faced calls for his resignation over his
relationship with Rupert Murdoch appeared to be enjoying himself.

Other
guests included Transport Secretary Justine Greening, Environment 
Secretary Caroline Spelman, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke, 
Communities Minister Eric Pickles and the party's Paymaster General 
Francis Maude.

Senior
ministers are privately furious at his handling of the issue and MPs 
openly compared him to John Major, whose premiership was destroyed by 
infighting over Europe.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox yesterday became the most senior figure to demand an immediate renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

In a bid to placate furious Eurosceptics, Mr Cameron said he would not rule out an in/out referendum after the next election which could lead to the UK withdrawing from the EU altogether.

But he flatly refused a call from 100 Tory MPs that he pass a new law before 2015 guaranteeing a nationwide vote in the next Parliament.

Mr Cameron urged his MPs to show 
‘patience’ over renegotiating the terms of the UK’s EU membership while 
the ‘firestorm’ of the eurozone crisis is continuing.

But
senior ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson are understood to 
have expressed displeasure at the tone of his remarks in Brussels on 
Friday, in which he ruled out an in/out referendum before 2015.

Five
ministerial aides have written to Mr Cameron demanding a referendum and
indicating that they are prepared to quit if they don’t get what they 
want.

Mr Duncan 
Smith’s parliamentary private secretary Conor Burns – one of those who 
has written to the PM – condemned the ‘broken promises’ of leaders over 
Europe and said: ‘Our credibility hinges on delivering a clear, binding 
promise for a referendum.’

Under pressure: David Cameron is facing opposition from within his own party over Europe

But
Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘There are those who argue for an in/out 
referendum now. I don’t agree with that because I don’t believe leaving 
the EU would be best for Britain. But nor do I believe that voting to 
preserve the exact status quo would be right either.

‘Far
from ruling out a referendum for the future as a fresh deal in Europe 
becomes clear, we should consider how best to get the fresh consent of 
the British people.’

Former defence secretary Liam Fox has called for the UK to renegotiate its relationship with Brussels

Dr Fox explicitly rejected Mr Cameron’s claim that now is not the time to negotiate.

‘We
should not wait for EU leaders to recognise the failure of the 
ill-conceived euro before we set out what we want for the British 
people, he said. ‘Britain’s destiny is not a debating issue for leaders 
on the Continent. It must be made in Britain.’
