Three panhandlers were arrested Wednesday for stabbing a woman to death on Hollywood's star-lined 'Walk of Fame' Tuesday night.

Christine Calderon, 23, took pictures of the homeless men before she was stabbed once in the torso, according to KTLA.

Police found Calderon bleeding in front of the American Eagle Outfitters around 8.30pm. Witnesses said bystanders tried to stop the bleeding.

Investigation: Police arrested three suspects in the fatal stabbing of  Calderon who was murdered on Hollywood's 'Walk of Fame'

Police said Christine Calderon died in front of an American Eagle Outfitters near Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue in Los Angeles

'The girl was just laying on the ground with blood everywhere,' Monta Cobbin, an employee of the American Eagle store, told NBC. 'Everyone was trying to help her stop the blood.'

'She was wearing jeans and I think it was a white tank top and it was covered in blood,' said a street vendor who did not want to be identified.

Calderon, of Lynwood, California, was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center but died during surgery around 11.40pm.

Homicide detectives said Calderon was walking along Hollywood Boulevard with a male co-worker when she stopped to take a picture of a cardboard sign one of the men was holding, according to the Los Angeles Times. She had been amused by the rude words and smiley face on the sign.

The men wanted Calderon to pay $1 for the picture, but she refused, igniting a dispute that ended in Miss Calderon's life.

One of the men jumped on Calderon, pushing her to the ground, as her co-worker was pinned against a wall, according to the Times. Miss Calderon was bleeding as she ran away.

The suspects were identified at the scene around midnight using photographs Calderon and her friend took.

The men, who are believed to be homeless, were found near the scene by homicide detectives. Police say the men are all white and in their late twenties and early thirties. 

Miss Calderon's mother Yolonde Tassin told the Times she became worried about her daughter when she stopped texting her back on Tuesday night. She knew Calderon was dead when detectives showed up at her home the next day.

'I said, "My daughter's dead isn't she?"' Ms Tassin said. 'And he gave me a slight nod.'

The grief-stricken mother said that in the last few years, her daughter had been working to make her life better, had given up alcohol and drugs and was studying to become an engineer.

She told the Times: 'She didn't want to waste years. She wanted to get in there and do it right.'

Police cautioned others to be careful when approaching anyone on the street.

'Just be aware of your surroundings and be careful. Generally, in my experience as a law enforcement officer, people, transients don’t like their pictures being taken,' LAPD Officer Cleon Joseph said.

'I'm not saying that’s a cause or reason for anything, but you just at the end of the day need to be careful,' Joseph added.

The area where Calderon was killed is usually packed with tourists, attracting beggars and costumed street performers hoping to cash-in on their ignorance and demanding money for posed pictures.

Calderon's family told the Times she hung out in the area with her friends.

Police patrols along the street were beefed up after the fatal incident. Witnesses reported seeing armed officers on rooftops on Wednesday night.
