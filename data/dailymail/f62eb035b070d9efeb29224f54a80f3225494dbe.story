Sajid Javid, the Culture Secretary, will pledge that the Conservatives will set up a 'small business conciliation service'

The Tories will today promise a crackdown on the scandal of late payments totalling £40billion to small businesses.

Sajid Javid, the Culture Secretary, will pledge that the Conservatives will set up a ‘small business conciliation service’ to help smaller firms resolve disputes with larger customers.

In his speech, which marks Small Business Saturday, he will say that his upbringing above a shop means he understands what small companies go through.

When Mr Javid was four, his father took over a ladieswear shop in inner-city Bristol, and the family moved into a two-bedroom flat above it. He will say: ‘Recent figures showed that last year alone there was £40billion still owed to small businesses. This is an absolute scandal.

‘We lived above the shop – my parents and their five sons. And that upbringing seared something onto our souls: a belief in enterprise, opportunity, reward for hard work.

‘So I know what it’s like for small businesses. Your fortunes, your happiness – they fluctuate with the day’s takings.

‘We are fed up with the way so many hard working, reliable people are being treated.’

He will add: ‘Today I can promise that we will take action. We will legislate to take action against unfair contractual practices I am confident our measures will help thousands of businesses get the billions of pounds they’re owed. And it’s right we do so. Because you’re the backbone of our economy, and you shouldn’t have your backs broken by clients who don’t keep their side of a deal.’

Speaking in Birmingham, Mr Javid is expected to promise legislation to make sure 30-day payment terms are passed down the supply chain on all public sector contracts. Poor performers on late payments will be named and shamed through the Small Business Bill, and there will be a requirement for all government suppliers to adhere to the prompt payment code. Suppliers who flout the code will be struck off.

And in addition to the Conservative manifesto pledge to set up a ‘small business conciliation service’, business minister Matt Hancock will write to all FTSE 350 companies asking them to adhere to the prompt payment code.

The department of Business, Innovation and Skills will also launch a survey of businesses on how the code can be strengthened, and there will be action to stop big companies changing contract terms retrospectively.
