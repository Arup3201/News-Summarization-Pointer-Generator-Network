These are the two men who appeared in court this morning accused of murdering an off-duty police officer during a Christmas night out.

Christopher Spendlove, 30, and Andrew Taylor, 28, are accused of beating newlywed officer Neil Doyle to death in an 'unprovoked and vicious attack' in Liverpool city centre.

The men, who are both former non-league footballers who also played in the U.S., were remanded in custody at today's hearing at Liverpool Crown Court.

PC Neil Doyle (pictured), who got married just five months ago, was with two other off-duty officers when they were attacked in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Friday. PC Doyle died of a fatal bleed on the brain

Up to 40 people crammed into the public gallery for the brief hearing, which lasted no more than 10 minutes.

Among those on one side of the gallery was believed to be Spendlove's mother, who gestured warmly to her son as he was led from the dock.

The defendants, both from Liverpool, spoke only to confirm their names and dates of birth. Spendlove confirmed his date of birth as last Thursday.

PC Doyle, who got married just five months ago, and two other off-duty officers were attacked in the city's Colquitt Street in the early hours of Friday.

A post-mortem examination concluded that PC Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain.

The other two officers, named in court today as Michael Steventon and Robert Marsh, were treated in hospital for facial injuries.

Both defendants, who are well known on the non-league football circuit, also face charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The incident occurred in Liverpool's Colquitt Street at 3.15am on Friday

Both defendants also face charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to those two officers.

No applications for bail were made as the Recorder of Liverpool, Judge Clement Goldstone QC, adjourned the proceedings and said a trial date would be set at the next preliminary hearing in January.

Richard Pratt QC, representing Taylor, said there were some matters of 'considerable anxiety' for his client which he wished to be aired in court, and were noted by the judge.

Following the hearing, Mr Pratt confirmed to the Press Association that Taylor wanted to 'deflect' any suggestion that last Friday's incident was a targeted attack and that Taylor did not deliver any blows.

It is understood that both defendants, said to be close friends, played football together while studying at Oklahoma City University in America.

They were team-mates at U.S. soccer league outfit Austin Aztex, who were managed at the time by former Everton star Adrian Heath.

Taylor returned to the UK to sign for non-league team Forest Green Rovers in 2009 before later moving to Burscough FC and Vauxhall Motors.

Spendlove stayed in the U.S. and went on to play for Portland Phoenix, Wilmington Hammerheads and Oklahoma City Energy FC, where he was announced as a new assistant coach in January.

The Oklahoma City Energy FC’s General Manager, Jason Hawkins said the organisation was 'stunned' by the news. 

'Given the seriousness of the charges, we have made the decision to dismiss Chris from the organization. That said, we are deeply saddened by the news of the incident and our hearts go out to the family of the police officer who lost his life. We are also disheartened for Chris. 

'As an assistant coach, he was always professional and conducted himself in a proper and respectful manner. Our thoughts are also with him and his family during this difficult time.' 

Following PC Doyle's death in hospital, his widow, Sarah, 37, said in a statement: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all.

'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.'

The couple married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month.
