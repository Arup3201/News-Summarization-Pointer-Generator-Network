Celebrities are well-known for their gruelling fitness regimes and healthy-eating lifestyles.

So it comes as little surprise that A-list events such as the BAFTAs will have various dietary whims to cater for.

In fact, organisers at this year’s awards dinner have revealed they will now be serving a vegan menu, for stars who are meat-free.

The 'plant-based' meal will feature a starter of quinoa salad with radishes, broad beans, asparagus, peas and a lemon and olive oil dressing.

Best leading actor Bafta nominees Benedict Cumberbatch for The Imitation Game and Eddie Redmayne for The Theory of Everything will be attending the awards dinner at Grosvenor House Hotel on February 8

The Bafta banquet table at London's Grosvenor House Hotel will seat eight people 

Next up will be a roasted butternut squash and sun-blushed tomato lasagne with wilted spinach, roasted pepper and sage as the main course.

Details of the dessert have not been revealed.

The menu also has bespoke gluten and dairy-free dishes for those on dietary restrictions.

The BAFTA dinner, which takes place on Sunday 8 February at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London was created by Grosvenor House's executive chef Nigel Boschetti and BAFTA head chef Anton Manganaro.

PETA director Mimi Bekhechi said: 'Interest in vegan eating is skyrocketing in the UK and beyond.

The BAFTA organisers have created a meat-free menu for vegan celebrities

‘With some of the world's best chefs, including Jamie Oliver and Wolfgang Puck, getting creative with cruelty-free cooking, we're sure that guests attending the BAFTAs are in for a treat.'

Karin Ridgers, founder of VeggieVision.tv, said: ‘It’s great that the BAFTAs are going vegan with so many celebrities now cutting out meat and dairy.

‘As more awareness is being created the celebrities know that they want the best and healthiest food choice so they can remain in the best shape, give the best performances and look amazing too.

‘A vegan diet is bursting with great fresh foods and provides everything our bodies need to thrive.

‘The menu sounds delicious, fresh vegetables packed with vitamins, quinoa and peas packed with protein and oils too. A low fat, no cholesterol energy-boosting choice that I feel will be chosen by many celebrities vegan or not,' she added. 

While vegans are tucking into meat-free delights, nominees including Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Redmayne, Jake Gyllenhaaal, and Reese Witherspoon are some of the guests who will be feasting on mouth-watering dishes including salmon and crab terrine and braised short rib at the event.

As well as quaffing their way through 200 magnums of Champagne and 1,200 bottles of wine, they will sip on specially-created bourbon cocktails crafted for this year's awards.

Created by Grosvenor House’s executive chef Nigel Boschetti and Bafta’s head chef Anton Manganaro, this years’ awards menu – which includes vegetarian options as well as bepoke vegan, gluten and dairy-free dishes for those on dietary restrictions – is a hearty affair, although the lack of carbohydrate options is obvious.

The dinner, which has been six months in planning, has been pulled together by a team of 25 chefs, who went through numerous tastings with Bafta executives before the final versions were approved.

And with 1,950 guests to feed, dinner preparations will start two days in advance as the 200 magnums of Champagne, 1,200 bottles of wine, 1 tonne of beef, 100kg of chocolate and elements for the 8,500 canapes arrive. 

The evening kicks off with a quartet of canapes, designed especially for the occasion, using fresh and seasonal British produce.

Guests will nibble on ham and onion breadsticks, rare Aberdeen Angus fillet, smoked salmon tartar and quails eggs with dill mayonnaise while sipping on the Bafta 2015 bourbon and orange marmalade-based Marmahattan cocktail.
