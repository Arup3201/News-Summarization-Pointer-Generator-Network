Jodi Arias hid her face and wept today as the court was shown sexually explicit photos of her with ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander just hours before he was brutally murdered.

Detective Michael Melendez told the Phoenix court on Monday that he had recovered the deleted pictures from the victim's camera.

Arias shielded her face with her hair and touched her eyes with a tissue as the prosecution showed jurors naked photographs of the pair taken around 1.45pm on June 4, 2008.

Several hours later, at 5.30pm, a series
 of photographs show 30-year-old Alexander in the shower with the water 
running. The images appeared to have been taken by someone else.

Around 45 seconds later, according to the picture's time stamp, jurors were shown a photograph of the bathroom ceiling that appeared to have been taken unintentionally when the camera dropped.

Less than a minute later, a grisly photograph  was taken which apparently depicts the back of Alexander's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck. 

It is alleged that it was mistakenly taken as Arias dragged her ex-lover's body through his Mesa home after stabbing him 27 times.

A large dark obstruction in the foreground of the picture is a leg in sweatpants, the jury in Maricopa County, Arizona heard.

The prosecution claims that the picture was 
taken as Arias flew into a rage after learning her 
ex-boyfriend wanted to date someone else.

Detective Melendez told the court that although pictures had been deleted from the camera, they remained on the hard drive.

Earlier in the day, the jury watched 
police interrogation tapes of Arias as she denied over and 
over again that she had stolen a handgun and used it to kill her 
ex-boyfriend.

Arias
 repeatedly told authorities that she had never seen the gun and did not
 know her grandparents kept one at their home in Yreka, California until 
it had been stolen.

The .25-caliber gun went missing a week before Alexander was killed, during a break-in at the home Arias shared with her grandparents.

Police told the court today that the burglary appeared 'odd' because only one gun was stolen out of four and piles of coins had not been taken.

Prosecutors have claimed that Arias repeatedly stabbed 
Alexander in his shower before dragging him to his bedroom and slicing 
his throat.

She then allegedly took him back to the bathroom to shoot 
him in the head. Two friends found his body in the shower on June 9, 2008, five days after he was killed.

Defense attorneys say the trickling blood in the image is from Arias shooting Alexander in the head in self-defense, HLN reported. The prosecution alleges he was already dead when this wound was inflicted.

Investigators found the grisly image on Alexander's camera, which had been thrown in the washing machine and put through a washing cycle with blood-soaked towels and clothes after his murder.

'Obsessed': Arias, 32, allegedly stabbed Travis Alexander, pictured, 27 times and shot him in the head

It is just one of many photographs 
shown by prosecutors in the murder trial of the 32-year-old photographer
 accused of killing her one-time boyfriend, a Mormon motivational 
speaker.

In the opening days of the trial last 
week, the jury also saw blood-splattered scenes inside his home, as well
 as blood stains in his bedroom carpet.

They were also shown images of his horrifying wounds, including defensive wounds across his hands, and a neck wound so deep as she sliced his neck that it hit the bone.

Arias wiped away tears as the 
 Maricopa County 
medical examiner said Alexander 'may have' already been dead when she 
shot him in the head - a key detail that could make way for the death 
penalty.

If
 she did shoot Alexander after he was already dead it could qualify as a
 'heinous and depraved' murder, which would more likely send her to death row in Arizona.

Yet the medical examiner said he could 
not be fully certain Alexander was already dead from blood loss as the 
body was already decomposing when it was found five days after the 
killing.

With the delicate brain tissue also 
decomposing, he could not determine a bullet track through the skull or 
how much hemorrhaging had occurred, which would signal whether Alexander
 was still alive.

While at first denying that she had even
 seen him that day, Arias now admits to killing him but says she did so in self
 defense after he had been abusive and possessive throughout their 
relationship.

Other images 
on the camera show the pair, whom had kept up a sexual relationship 
since breaking up after five months of dating in 2007, in sexually 
explicit poses on the day of his murder.

On Thursday, the prosecution attempted 
to paint Arias as a serial liar by playing segments of interviews with 
police and on Inside Edition where she protested her innocence.

Evidence: Another image apparently shows marks along the wall where Alexander's body was dragged

In the program, she claims she saw two men attack him, adding: 'No jury will convict me. Mark my words.'

The portrayal builds on that suggested on Wednesday when another former flame, Ryan Burns, revealed Arias had lied about cuts to her hands when she arrived at his home 24 hours later.

Burns testified on Wednesday that he had exchanged long emails and 
phone calls with Arias after they met at a business conference in the spring of 2008.

He invited her to his home in West 
Jordan, Utah in June 2008 - and she arrived a day later than planned, 
telling Burns she had got lost, driven the wrong way and slept in her 
car for a while, he said.

In fact, she had spent the previous day with Alexander, eventually murdering him out of 'self defense', she claims.

testified that Arias visited him at his Utah home 24 hours after she 
killed Alexander - but she never mentioned the killing, despite claiming
 it was out of self defense

Yet
 when she visited Burns the day after the murder, she never once 
mentioned the ordeal she had supposedly been through the previous day, 
he said in court. They kissed and joked, he said.

When she arrived at his home, Burns noticed that she had bandaged hands, but she told him she had sustained the cuts after breaking a glass at her job at a Margaritaville, he said.

But Det. Nathan Mendes, who worked at the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office, said there was no Margaritaville in the county where she lived with her grandparents at the time.

Burns added that he did not know Arias was still seeing Alexander when the two began talking and making plans to visit each other, ABC News reported.

Prosecutors also exposed other lies 
told by Arias after playing interviews with Mesa detective Esteban 
Flores in which she said she last talked to Alexander on Tuesday night, 
June 3, 2008.

She claimed she had been in Los Angeles and was about to go to Utah.

'It was brief though, 
10 o'clock maybe,' she said. 'I'd say 10 p.m. or 9 - 9:30. I was calling people 
because I was bored on the road. He was nice and cordial, but kind of 
acting like he had hurt feelings.

'I may have called 
him Wednesday, from the road, and I sent him a couple of text messages, 
and a couple of pictures," she said, though Alexander didn't pick up because he had a full voice mailbox.

'That's unusual. He deletes all of his 
messages. I didn't want to be obsessive about it because we're not 
together anymore and I didn't like to call too much.'

She added that she was shocked to learn of Alexander's death from one of his friends, and thought it must be a mistake.

Alexander was found dead in his home in suburban Mesa on June 9, 2008 by two friends who went to check on him after he had been out of contact for days.

Arias originally claimed she had not 
seen Alexander the day of his murder, before claiming she had seen two 
men kill him, before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense.

The couple had met at a work 
conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the 
phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 
emails.

They started dating
 in 
February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be 
baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias 
telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.
