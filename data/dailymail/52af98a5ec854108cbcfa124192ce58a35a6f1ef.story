The Avon lady whose murder led to an 
international manhunt may have been dead for up to a week before her 
mother went to check on her and was also killed, detectives fear.

The bodies of Angela Holgate, 54, and Alice Huyton, 75, were found together on Saturday.

However
police believe Mrs Holgate may have died some days before her mother. 
They said she had not been seen for a week before she was found 
murdered.

Murdered: Angela Holgate, 54, who was discovered dead at her home, along with her mother Alice Huyton, 75, right

Wanted: Merseyside Police have asked lodger Barry Morrow, 51, to contact them to help with their enquiries over the double death

Two Women Found Dead

Yesterday they said engineer Barry 
Morrow, who had been lodging at Mrs Holgate’s house, was seen arriving 
by ferry in France hours after the bodies were discovered.

He
was driving Mrs Holgate’s new Citroen, which had been taken from her 
drive. The powerfully built 51-year-old had previously been in a 
relationship with Mrs Holgate, a divorcee with two grown-up daughters.

Yesterday
detectives investigating the murders revealed Mrs Holgate hadn’t been 
seen for a week when her worried mother went to check on her last 
Friday.

Chief 
Superintendent Nikki Holland, of Merseyside Police, said Mrs Huyton was 
going to stay with her daughter because she thought she was ill.

Her husband Jim had raised the alarm 
on Saturday after not hearing from either his wife or daughter. He asked
his son-in-law to call at the house and it was he who discovered the 
bodies.

‘Alice’s husband Jim didn’t report 
the fact that she hadn’t returned home on Friday night because she had 
said she was staying the night,’ she said.

‘By teatime on Saturday, he became 
concerned as he hadn’t been able to get hold of Alice, and that’s when 
he asked the son-in-law to go and check on their welfare of both 
ladies.’

Last night Mr Huyton was said to be devastated at the loss of both his wife and daughter.

Probe: Forensic officers investigate the house where the bodies of two women were found in Southport late on Saturday afternoon

Search: Officers enter the house near a black garage following the grim discovery on Saturday

Find: Police are also investigating the whereabouts of Ms Holgate's white Citroen car, which also went missing after the bodies were found

Search: A forensics officer at the house where two bodies were found

Police yesterday confirmed that both 
women had been asphyxiated and said there was no sign of a break-in at 
the semi-detached house in a suburb of Southport.

They believe Mr Morrow may have travelled through France to Spain, where he once lived.

He was last seen at 7.20pm on Saturday arriving at Calais.      

They said they were not formally 
treating Mr Morrow as a suspect but wanted him to return to England and 
tell them what he knew. No warrant has been issued for his arrest but an
alert has been issued to police forces across Europe.

‘He is a lodger at the address and he
is potentially the last person to see both ladies alive, and it is on 
that basis that we urgently need to speak to him,’ Chief Supt Holland 
added.

‘I have no reason to believe that he 
is a danger to the public, so I would ask those who know Barry to ask 
him to come and speak to us about what he may or may not know.’

Mr Morrow is described as white, 5ft7in, of medium to stocky build, with straight, brown receding hair and blue eyes.

Witnesses or anyone with information should call detectives on 0151 777 3165 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
