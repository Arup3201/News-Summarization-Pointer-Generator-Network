Tyson Fury is seeking a Saturday night replacement for Dereck Chisora so he can still have his second heavyweight fight in 15 months.

Chisora fractured his left hand during his final sparring session and withdrew on Monday - just five days before the first bell in Manchester.

Chisora’s late withdrawal follows the collapse of Fury’s two fights with David Haye, which have stalled the giant traveller’s career.

But Fury is now expected to face a new opponent at the phones4u Arena.

‘After being messed about so much I’m determined to box on the Manchester show despite Chisora pulling out,’ said Fury.

'This has all been very frustrating.  We are looking for an adequate replacement and I will be fighting on Saturday night.

‘I’ve been training for months and I’m in the best shape of my life so for this to happen again is a big blow.’

Fury was due to meet Chisora for the right to face world champion Wladimir Klitschko, three years after winning their first fight on points at Wembley Arena.

Focused: Fury will be disappointed at Chisora's late withdrawal after preparing for his date in the ring

Talks are under way to find a new date for the clash, which could take place as early as September.

On Monday, Chisora said: ‘I can’t tell you how disappointed I am to have to pull out of the fight but it is on the advice of my specialist.

'I’m sorry for the fans but once my hand is healed and I’m given the all-clear to train and punch again, I’ll be working on the new date.

‘I was in fantastic shape and had a great training camp, probably the best so far in my career, and was looking forward to getting revenge on Fury, but that will have wait.

‘I’m sorry to have to pull out on Fury, as I know that he had been training hard and it was going to be a great fight between two top athletes. I hope we can get it on again soon.’

Promoter Frank Warren insisted the fight will be rescheduled and that Saturday’s show will still go ahead, with middleweight Billy Joe Saunders’s European title fight with Emanuele Blandamura topping the bill.

Warren added: ‘There’s no way that Dereck could fight with his hand fractured and there’s no way I would let him get into the ring and fight with an injury like that.’
