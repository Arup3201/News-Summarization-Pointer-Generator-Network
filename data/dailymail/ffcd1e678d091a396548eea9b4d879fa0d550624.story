Plans for a massive new Grand Canyon development which would feature an IMAX theatre and gondola tram have sparked a bitter land dispute.

The proposed project would be built on the eastern rim of the Arizona canyon on an untouched plateau and would be linked down to the canyon floor by the tram.

The site for the proposed development is called 'the confluence' and is where the Colorado River meets the Little Colorado River on the canyon's east side  - and according to the Navajo creation story, is the spot where their people first emerged.

But now Developers Confluence Partners want to create a new 420-acre multimedia complex complete with IMAX theater, shops, hotels, an RV park and gondola tram which would ferry visitors the 1.6 miles to the canyon floor in just 10 minutes.

The Grand Canyon National Park attracts more than five million tourists every year. 

But it is also spiritually significant to the Hopi, Zuni, Acoma and Laguna Navajo tribes.

Renae Yellowhorse, a member of the Navajo Nation, said: 'It is my church, it is where I say my prayers. It is where I give my offerings. It's where I commune with the holy ones, the gods that walk along the canyon,' she told NBC News.

The developers have also outlined plans for a 'Riverwalk' on the canyon floor which would include  walkways, restaurants, a tramway station, toilets, a terraced seating area and a wastewater package plant.

Leigh J. Kuwanwisiwma said the confluence is the 'final spiritual resting place' for Hopi ancestors, and building the project 'would severely compromise access and our ability to practice religion' on the site

Those supporting the project argue it will allow tourists to see the canyon in a different way.

At the moment the shortest path down to the canyon floor is seven miles of scrub path - the proposed gondola would make the trip just 10 minutes. 

The National Park Service has said the Grand Canyon is 'in danger' under the project and Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent Dave Uberuaga branded the plans 'a travesty'.

But Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly said he will support the project and the $65 million required from the tribe for road, water and communication facilities.

He said he sees the plans as an 'opportunity' for the Navajo. 

'I want my people to have a better life. I want them to have jobs, they need homes, good homes. They need better education,' he told NBC.

When Mr Shelly was asked about those Navajo tribal members who do not want the development he said: 'Some of them want to go back to the old ways. But you can't go back.'

Mr Shelly added the Navajo suffer from high unemployment and suicide rates.

Business opportunities on the land are scarce because for 40 years development on 1.6 million acres of tribal land was halted by the government under  'The Bennett Freeze'.

It was intended to prevent both the Hopi and Navajo tribes from building on the land, because the tribes disputed its ownership.

Members of the Hopi tribe are opposing the project and have said the proposed development is too close to one of their sacred sites, the Hopi Salt Trail. 

Leigh J. Kuwanwisiwma, Director for the Hopi Tribe's Cultural Preservation Office, said the confluence is the 'final spiritual resting place' for  Hopi ancestors, and building a tourist destination 'would severely compromise access and our ability to practice religion' on the site.

But Navajo Albert Hale, one of Confluence Partners' developers, argues the project will allow his tribe to profit from their land while giving visitors to the area a breathtaking view. 

He claims the tribe could receive up to 18 percent of gross revenue from the development.

Mr Shelly is expected to sign a proposed resolution authorizing the project soon, and developers hope to begin the project as early as the spring of 2017 - but tribe members say they will not stop opposing the development.

They have founded a group called 'Save the Confluence' and are spreading their message with stickers and painted signs across the Navajo reservation.

Mr Kuwanwisiwma said: 'These landscapes and the canyon and the confluence today are still very, very important to the Hopi people and we'll never let that go.

'We're not going to give up on being good stewards of these lands. Never.'
