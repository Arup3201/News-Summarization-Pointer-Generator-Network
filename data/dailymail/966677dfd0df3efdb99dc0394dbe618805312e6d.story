David Cameron has slapped down one of his own MPs who derided the Olympic opening ceremony for being too ‘multicultural’, calling the remarks ‘idiotic’.

Tory MP Aidan Burley used Twitter to criticise Friday night’s ceremony as ‘leftie multicultural c***’.

But the Prime Minister said Mr Burley had confirmed his belief that Twitter could make politicians appear foolish as it encouraged them to put their unconsidered thoughts into the public domain, stating: ‘I did once say something about people who use Twitter, particularly politicians, and I think in this case I was absolutely spot on. I think what he said was completely wrong. It was an idiotic thing to say.’

The prime minister has called Aidan Burley's, right, criticism of the opening ceremony 'completely wrong' and 'idiotic'

Cannock Chase MP Mr Burley, who was sacked last year as a ministerial aide after he took part in a Nazi-themed stag party, has since tried to say his comments were misunderstood.

He insisted: ‘I was talking about the way it was handled in the show, not multiculturalism itself.’

Mr Cameron’s intervention drew criticism from other Tory backbenchers.Nadine Dorries tweeted: ‘If DC can keep quiet when his public school pals have expenses spotlight shone on them, should do the same when new backbencher messes up.’

Stewart Jackson said: ‘Surely PM should have risen above criticising his own MP re: Olympics opening ceremony? He may disagree with Aidan Burley MP but why say so?’

Miss Dorries added: ‘He could have answered in a way which was dignified. Like, I didn’t agree and will be having a quiet word.’

Mr Cameron admitted yesterday that there were aspects of British life that people would have liked included in the ceremony that were absent but insisted: ‘We can’t all be art director.’

On a visit to the Olympic Park, he added: ‘I thought  that it was a brilliant effort to bring together our past, our future and the vibrancy of our country.’

When he was first shown the images of the Queen meeting James Bond at Buckingham Palace before appearing to parachute into the stadium, Mr Cameron said it brought a ‘tear to his eye’, adding: ‘It was every bit as good in its execution as it was in its creation.’

He added that he had known about the Queen’s spectacular role for some time, as he had seen her on the day of filming.

Mr Cameron also denied claims that ministers had wanted to cut parts of the ceremony over fears its content was too Left-wing, saying: ‘It is not about politics.

'We all celebrate the NHS. We all think James Bond is fantastic. We all revere the Queen.’

But he revealed that he had discussed the ceremony with director Danny Boyle.
