New York Giants tight end Larry Donnell was one of the 127 passengers aboard the Delta flight that slid off the runway at LaGuardia Airport Thursday morning.

Donnell shared photos and video of his experience after the incident, and even joked about what had just happened, writing; 'Look at this sh*t! Knew I shoulda stayed my ass at home.'

Then, a few hours later, MSNBC reported that they had Donnell on the phone to give an account of what happened on the flight.

Unfortunately for MSNBC however, they were being pranked.

A man had called in pretending to be Donnell, and when he had a chance to speak, shouted out 'Fu*k her right in the pu**y' on live television. 

The man then hung up immediately after.

Delta Flight 1086, an MD-88 arriving from Atlanta, skidded off runway 13 and was leaking fuel and had a broken wing after striking a fence during blizzard conditions shortly after 11am Thursday.

It stopped just feet away from entering the water. 

The crash shut down LaGuardia Airport and caused minor injuries, with 24 people being treated total.

The airport is expected to be open again later today, and currently has one runway in operation.
