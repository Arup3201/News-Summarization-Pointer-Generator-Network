Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah's loan move to Fiorentina has been confirmed until the end of the season. 

Salah follows Andre Schurrle out of Stamford Bridge, despite only arriving at the club from Basle last January.

The 22-year-old has struggled to make an impression under manager Jose Mourinho, making just three Premier League appearances and failing to score in any competition.

The Egyptian forward will now spend the rest of the campaign in Serie A with La Viola, who sold Juan Cuadrado to the Blues just a matter of hours earlier for a fee of £26.8million.

Chelsea made the 26-year-old their primary target for the January transfer window and the Colombia international has now completed his move, penning a four-and-a-half-year deal.

Cuadrado joins Chelsea for an initial fee of £23.3million, which will rise to just shy of £27million with bonuses.

He said: ‘I am very happy and thankful for this opportunity I’ve been given. This is a great club and honestly it is like a dream to join the Chelsea family and to know that the manager believes in me. I’m happy.

'We are a big club so we want win important things. winning the league championship is the most important thing, I think.

'Chelsea have big players so we want to win big things.'
