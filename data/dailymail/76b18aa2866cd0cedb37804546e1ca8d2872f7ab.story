A six-year-old boy who suffers from an incredibly rare condition is not allowed to play outside in the winter, as catching a virus could kill him.

The genetic disease, which affects just 50 people in the world, means Uzair Akhtar struggles to fight off the mildest infection.

It means even a common cold or simple case of chicken pox could potentially kill him.

He was diagnosed with Hyperimmunoglobin E Syndrome (HIES) two years ago, and without a life-saving bone marrow transplant he won't survive into adulthood.

Uzair Akhtar, from Bradford, doesn't go out to play in winter as his mother is afraid he will be struck down by just a common cold, which could prove deadly

In the winter months, his parents wrap him up warm before he goes to school and don't like to take the risk of letting him play outside.

His mother Sufia Rashid said: 'We have had a lot of snow recently and it's heartbreaking because we can't take the risk of letting him play outside.

'Just to get him to school, we have to dress him in thermals, leggings, multiple pairs of socks, a hat and a balaclava. You can only see his eyes, it's so sad but we have to make sure he doesn't get cold at all.

'Uzair wants to go and build snowmen and have snowball fights but just being outside for ten minutes could put him at risk of a life-threatening infection.'

Although chilly temperatures have not been proven to increase your chance of catching a cold, winter weather may make the inside lining of your nose drier and more vulnerable to viral infection.

The youngster, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was a sickly child from birth and suffered regularly from colds and sickness bugs.

But he was finally diagnosed with HIES after he contracted salmonella poisoning when he was four-years-old. The condition is caused by a mutation in his DOCK8 gene.

After a month in hospital with rehydration treatments, Uzair was sent home but Sufia and his dad Pervaiz Akhtar, soon noticed he had relapsed.

Further tests revealed Uzair's white blood cell count was between 50 and 60, when it should have been as low as 0.04 in a child of his age.

Ms Rashid said: 'Generally he seemed OK in himself but he picked up lots of coughs and colds. We kept going back to hospital but they didn't know what was wrong with him.

'The doctors couldn't understand why his white blood cell count was so high.'

Leaving doctors at Bradford Royal Infirmary (BRI) baffled, specialists at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) picked up on the syndrome, after Uzair was unable to stand on one leg when he got up one morning.

Ms Rashid, 37, said: 'He said that he couldn't stand on one of his legs. I called the doctor and they told me to take him straight to hospital.

'They didn't know what had happened, he didn't have any broken bones which is what his symptoms suggested.'

A series of MRI scans revealed Uzair had Osteomyelitis, a trait of HIES, which causes infection in the bone after it is spread through the blood.

Uzair became so poorly his weight dropped to just 20kg and his spine protruded through his back.

Ms Rashid had to be trained to give him intravenous injections through a tract which ran just centimetres from his heart, so he could have regular antibiotics, in an attempt to fight off the potentially deadly disease.

Now, the youngster must have a cocktail of antiviral and immunoglobulin therapy injections up to four times a day, which are fed directly into his stomach. Without the antibodies, Uzair's immune system would be extremely low and his life would be at risk every time he stepped outside the house.

But, the treatment is simply a short term fix, and Uzair must have a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible, to eliminate the syndrome from his body.

Mr Pervaiz, a factory worker, said: 'When we heard a bone marrow transplant could cure Uzair we were over the moon. But this quickly turned to fear as our family was tested and no one was a match for Uzair. He needs a transplant from a stranger, but so far there's no one on the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register who's a suitable match.'

Sufia, Pervaiz and Uzair's three-year-old brother Eisa are appealing for more people to be tested to see if their bone marrow is a match, in a desperate bid to save their son's life.

Ms Rashid, a nursery nurse, said: 'The antiviral injections won't help him forever, one day he will become immune to them.

'He urgently needs bone marrow and we are urging people to come forward and be tested. Even if people don't match Uzair, they can be put on the Anthony Nolan register and they are very likely to be able to help someone else, who desperately needs life-saving treatment.

'Uzair knows he's different, he says 'mummy, I'm a bit more poorly than most people' and I explain it's because he needs some special blood to help him feel better.'

Potential donors should be between the ages of 16-30 and in good health. Joining involves filling in a simple medical questionnaire and providing a saliva sample. Donating bone marrow is usually done through a process a bit like giving blood.

Rebecca Sedgwick, national recruitment manager at Anthony Nolan, said: 'We need potential donors from the Pakistani community to join the register to give patients like Uzair a chance of life.

'Patients who are white northern European have a 90 per cent chance of finding a match, but this falls to 40 per cent for patients from minority ethnic backgrounds.

'Anyone aged 16-30 who can't attend the event can join online at www.anthonynolan.org. We especially need donors from all minority ethnic backgrounds to join.'
