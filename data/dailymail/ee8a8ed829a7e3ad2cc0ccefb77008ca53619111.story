Caution: Justice Minister Jeremy Wright says reform is needed after it emerged that record numbers of career criminals are getting off with warnings from police

More than 26,000 repeat offenders were given a caution or verbal warning instead of being taken before the court, figures from the Ministry of Justice have revealed.

The figures, for the year up to June 2012, include up to 4,500 criminals with more than 15 previous offences on their criminal record.

This means 4.9 per cent of all adult offenders escaped with a caution, the highest proportion on record and more than twice the 2.2 per cent recorded a decade ago, reported the Daily Telegraph.

A total of 91,475 adult offenders were given a reprimand, warning or caution for a new crime and of those, 26,346 had three or more previous convictions or cautions.

Nearly 4,500 were guilty of 15 or more previous offences.

Dee Edwards, of the R and K Foundation, a crime victims' group, branded the figures 'horrendous' and called the criminal justice system a 'joke'.

She said: 'Rehabilitation is clearly not working and yet we still give them nothing more than a smack on the wrist.

'We are letting people go off the rails and even the law is not taking responsibility for them.'

The Magistratesâ€™ Association recently made a statement warning that police were giving out cautions and fines in situations where criminals should be taken to court.

Justice secretary Chris Grayling today said he was 'extremely concerned' by the figures.

He said: 'I am extremely concerned by these figures and am already looking into how police cautions are being used.

'We shouldn't remove the right for police officers to exercise discretion but the public are right to expect that people who commit serious crimes will be brought before a court where very tough sentences are available.'

The high use of out-of-court disposal such as a cautions, warnings or penalty notices for disorder was previously criticised in a joint report by the Inspectorate of Constabulary and Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.

And think-tank the Policy Exchange last year warned serious offenders are escaping justice because of an erratic and inappropriate use of cautions and penalty notices.

Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: 'Criminals who commit serious crimes should always be prosecuted and brought before a court where very tough sentences are available.

'Reoffending has been shamefully high for too long and the public expect better. We can't keep having people going around and round the system.

'That is why we are reforming the criminal justice system so offenders are properly punished and the root causes of their behaviour addressed.'

But Conservative MP Nick de Bois, a member of the Commons Justice Select Committee, said: 'These serial offenders see the justice system as just an inconvenience in their career in crime.'
