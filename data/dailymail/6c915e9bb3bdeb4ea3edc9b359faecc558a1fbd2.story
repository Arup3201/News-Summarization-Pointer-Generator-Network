A Mexican footballer who posted a racy picture of him and his television presenter girlfriend online could be dropped from his team for unprofessional behaviour. 

The raunchy picture of Jorge 'Chaton' Enriquez shows him stood between his girlfriend's legs with his trousers pulled down to reveal his underwear.

Chaton, who plays for Mexican top flight team Club Deportivo Guadalajara - known as Chivas, has a reputation for his off the pitch activities and has been linked with a string of models in the past.

Mexican footballer Jorge 'Chaton' Enriquez faces disciplinary action from his club after posting this racy picture of him and his girlfriend online

Chaton, who plays for Chivas, could be dropped for unprofessional behaviour because of the image of him and TV presenter Gladys Castellanos

Chaton was criticised by Chivas fans on Social media who said he should be focusing on improving his poor form on the pitch, rather than exposing his personal life online

Nestor del la Torre, president of Chivas, said he was shocked by the pictures, adding that they were too inappropriate to be posted by a member of his club.

He said the team were considering disciplining the 24-year-old player, who has played for Mexico eight times, by fining him or dropping him from the squad.

Chaton was also criticised by Chivas fans on social media, who said the player should be focusing on improving his poor form on the pitch, rather than exposing his personal life online.

The image of him and girlfriend Gladys Castellanos, 24, was posted by the player with the message 'I love you'.

Miss Castellanos responded to the fans' outrage, posting on social media that she loves Chaton and that nothing had made her happier than the relationship they have been in since last summer.

Miss Castellanos, 24, defended her boyfriend and said the raunchy picture was not of them

She insisted on Twitter that the photograph did not actually show them and said it was unfair that the footballer had been slammed over it.

The TV presenter said: 'It is easy to act and make comments without knowing the truth. 

'Yes this photo has attracted a huge amount of interest but me and Chaton are not in the photo.'

It is not the first time that the footballer's private life has caused controversy. A fling between him and Playboy model Leia Freitas cost him his relationship with former girlfriend Maria Teresa Gover, who he had been with for four years.
