A determined soon-to-be bride finally fulfilled her lifelong dream of meeting her birth mother before walking down the aisle; after a woman - the sister she never knew - reunited them on Facebook.

Carrie Ruegsegger, 22, now based in New Philadelphia, Ohio, was born in the nearby town of Lima and was given up for adoption by her mother Kelly at birth. Kelly already had two children and was single, broke, unemployed and homeless at the time.

Carrie, who appears to hold no grudge, tells Today of the moment they were reunited: 'It's more than I could have ever dreamed it would be... I don't even think we said "Hi". We just said "I love you. I've waited so long to meet you".'

Success: Carrie posted this photo (left) to Facebook, which was shared by hundreds of people and eventually seen by a woman who turned out to be her sister, and who sent the post to their mother (right)

'When, in middle school, Carrie started looking for her birth mother, her only resource was the name of the hospital she was born in, which had no records of Carrie even being there.

So more recently, when a work colleague suggested posting a photo of herself on Facebook holding a letter appealing for information - despite initially thinking it was 'dumb' - she went ahead.

Within two days, she had a hit.

A young woman called Aleshia Brown Speicher had been searching for the sister she knew her mother had given up for adoption. She saw the post, recognized how similar the pair looked, and sent Carrie a photo of herself and a message theorizing that they could be sisters.

Tearjerker: Carrie (front) said of her first meeting with Kelly (back), 'It's more than I could have ever dreamed it would be... I don't even think we said "Hi". We just said "I love you. I've waited so long to meet you"'

Attempts: Kelly sent Carrie (pictured as a child) loving letters (left) every year through the adoption agency, but when it closed down, the only tie she had to Carrie was severed

Old times: Kelly (pictured as a younger woman) was already a single mother-of-two. She was broke, unemployed and homeless at the time, and felt she couldn't give Carrie (pictured at birth) the life she deserved

Carrie recalls her instant response to seeing the photo of her sister: 'It was unbelievable! She's got my nose. She's got my eyes. She's got my features! She's definitely my sister.'

'She's got my eyes. She's got my features! She's definitely my sister'

In turn, Aleshia sent her mother Kelly a photo of Carrie, and Kelly immediately knew 'it had to be her.'

A few weeks later, just before Carrie's wedding to now-husband Bill Ruegsegger, the mother and daughter met in person; a memory Carrie says 'will last a lifetime.'

Kelly claims she didn't know what else she could have done with her baby Carrie in her situation at the time, but insists that she changed her mind about giving her up when she was born. She says she was told it was 'too late' and a nurse took Carrie away.

Carrie grew up with two adoptive brothers and was a keen sports player in school. She says that although she had a 'great' childhood, she always felt there was 'something' missing.

This became all the more poignant for Carrie when in February, 22 years later, she gave birth to her own child; a now six-month-old son called Bill. The motherly love she felt made her look at Kelly's decision to give her up for adoption in a different light.

'I could never give him up like that,' she says of Bill. 'For her to do that, that's something she's really strong to do.'

Happy ending: Kelly, pictured with Carrie (right) attended the wedding and she now lives a three hour drive from Carrie. The pair text with each other almost every day

Kelly was one the one to hand-pick Carrie's adoptive family. She says she never forgot about the daughter she gave away, and 'prayed' for her constantly.

She also sent Carrie a birthday card every year through the adoption agency, as well as letters telling her how much she loved her. It is unclear whether any of the letters ever reached Carrie, but the agency closed down and the only tie she had to Carrie was severed.

After finally being reunited all these years later, Kelly attended the wedding and she now lives a three hour drive from Carrie. The pair text with each other almost every day.
