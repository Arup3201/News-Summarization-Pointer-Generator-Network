European breaks in the autumn will be even better value for Britons now as the pound strengthens against the euro.

After a dip in the sterling attributed to the uncertainty surrounding the Scottish referendum, the pound has climbed again. 

With the euro at about 1.28 to the pound, Brits are getting eight per cent more spending power on the Continent than they would have at the same time last year.

Foreign exchange company Travelex said on Friday that Britons can now get £36 more when exchanging £500 into euros than they would have got 12 months ago.

'We saw consistent growth of the pound in early 2014, which was unsettled this month due to consumers' concerns over the Scottish referendum and what implications it would have on currency,' David Swann of Travelex said.

'It's reassuring to see the pound back on track - no doubt also helped by the Bank of England's moves towards increasing interest rates.'
