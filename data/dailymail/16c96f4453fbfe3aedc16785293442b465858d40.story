Prince Charles has expressed serious concern about the impact of ‘rushed’ Government plans to change ancient laws governing the Royal line of succession.

Friends told the Daily Mail that he believes altering the rules that give male heirs priority and bar members of the Royal Family from marrying Roman Catholics could have ‘unintended consequences’ that have not been properly considered.

He is understood to have raised a series of critical questions in a private meeting with one of Whitehall’s most senior mandarins last month.

Prince Charles has voiced serious concern about 'rushed' plans to change ancient laws governing the royal line of succession

The Prince of Wales backs the 
principle of changing the law to ensure the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge's first child becomes Queen if it is a girl, a move which has 
been discussed for several years, as long as it commands popular 
support.

But according to a well-placed 
source, he believes the potential consequences for the delicate 
relationship between the state and the Church of England, as well as for
 the rules governing other hereditary titles, have not been thought 
through.

In a meeting with Richard Heaton, 
permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, the Prince is said to have 
raised concerns about what will happen if his grandchild is allowed to 
marry a Roman Catholic, as the Government proposes.

Church leaders have previously 
expressed concern that if a future heir to the throne married a Roman 
Catholic, their children would be required by canon law to be brought up
 in that faith.

Ultimately, that could lead to the 
constitutional nightmare of an heir to the throne, due to become the 
Supreme Governor of the Church of England, being a Catholic and 
therefore barred from being crowned.

According to the source, the Prince 
was told the situation could be resolved by negotiations with the 
Vatican if it arose - a response he is said to have found 
‘unsatisfactory and unconvincing’.

He also raised questions about the 
potential impact of changing the rules of Royal succession for other 
titles that are currently passed down the male line. Already, several 
senior figures have raised the prospect of changing peerage law so that 
female heirs can succeed to the hereditary peerage.

Some daughters of the gentry are 
calling for equal rights to inherit titles, arguing that the new law 
will leave them ‘two steps behind’ the Royals. Such a move would cause 
turmoil in some of the country’s most aristocratic families.

The disclosure of the Prince’s reservations is a serious blow to the Government’s plans to change Royal succession law.

Though the issue was first raised by 
Tony Blair more than a decade ago, David Cameron struck an agreement 
with the 15 other countries where the Queen is head of state that the 
rules must be overhauled.

Mr Cameron told other Commonwealth 
leaders that in an age of ‘gender equality’, the 1701 Act of Settlement,
 which also bars members of the Royal Family from marrying Roman 
Catholics, is out of date and discriminatory.

The issue was given fresh significance by the announcement of the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy

There had been growing fears in Royal
 and Whitehall circles of controversy if the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge have a daughter who would be overtaken in line for the throne 
by any future male siblings.

In Japan, the Chrysanthemum Throne 
was rocked by a public backlash over succession laws favouring men when 
Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako had a girl, Aiko, 
Princess Toshi, who is their only child.

The issue was given fresh urgency by the announcement of the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy last month.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who
 is responsible for the issue at the Cabinet Office, immediately 
announced that the Government intended to rush through legislation using
 procedures usually reserved for anti-terror laws.

The change will need to be legislated
 for in all 16 Commonwealth realms - the UK, Australia, New Zealand, 
Canada, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, 
Belize, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu,
 St Vincent and the Grenadines and Papua New Guinea.

The changes mean that for all 
descendants of the Prince of Wales, a younger son will no longer take 
precedence over an elder daughter in the line of succession.

David Cameron told other Commonwealth leaders that in an age of 'gender equality', the 1701 Act of Settlement, which also bars members of the Royal Family from marrying Catholics, is out of date and discriminatory

Members of the Royal Family who marry
 a Roman Catholic will also in future be able to succeed to the Crown, 
and an ancient rule that means all descendants of George II are supposed
 to gain the consent of the Monarch to marry will also be scrapped and 
now apply only to the first six people in the line of succession.

The 1701 Act of Settlement means that
 only the Protestant heirs of Sophia, granddaughter of James I, can 
become King or Queen. It also gives precedence to male heirs.

The Act was drawn up in an era of 
religious strife to ensure the Protestant succession.  But it has 
increasingly been condemned as discriminatory against both Catholics and
 women in the modern world. Autumn Kelly, wife of the Queen’s grandson 
Peter Phillips, renounced her Catholic faith so her husband could retain
 his place as 11th in line to the throne after their wedding in 2008.

Other Royals, including Prince 
Michael of Kent, the Queen’s first cousin, have given up their claim to 
the throne in order to marry Catholics.

Roman Catholics are divided on the 
reform, with some hoping it will ultimately lead to the total repeal of 
the Act of Settlement, which bars Catholics from the throne.

But former Tory minister Ann 
Widdecombe, a Catholic, has previously expressed concern, saying: ‘If we
 get rid of the provision that the heir to the throne and the Monarch 
can’t marry a Catholic, we will undermine the link between the Monarchy 
and the Church of England which will threaten the establishment of the 
Church, taking with it our last figleaf that we are a Christian 
country.’

Concerns about the rule of male 
succession were raised with the birth of the Viscount Severn to the Earl
 and Countess of Wessex. He was installed in the Royal line of 
succession ahead of his sister, Lady Louise Windsor, who is four years 
older than him. Buckingham Palace was said to have agreed that the time 
had come to launch a concerted effort to change the law, even though 
that will mean legislation having to be overhauled or introduced in 
countries across the world.

A senior Government source said: ‘The
 idea that the Government would move one inch on this without the Palace
 being on board is ridiculous.’

A Cabinet Office spokesman added: ‘We would never comment on exchanges between the Government and the Prince of Wales.’

A spokesman for the Prince of Wales 
said: 'Any change in the law is a matter for the Government. If and when
 the Prince of Wales meets with senior civil servants it is always 
documented properly in the Court Circular. Issues discussed in those 
meetings are private.'

The publication of the Succession to 
the Crown Bill last month revealed the complexity of the changes that 
will be required to ensure that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s 
child, due later this year, will be Monarch regardless of sex.

As well as the Act of Settlement, 
several other Bills, including the Treason Act 1351, which was written 
in Norman French and is one of the oldest laws on the statute book, will
 have to be amended to ensure that causing the death of a first-born 
daughter of the Monarch, as well as a son, will be considered treason.
