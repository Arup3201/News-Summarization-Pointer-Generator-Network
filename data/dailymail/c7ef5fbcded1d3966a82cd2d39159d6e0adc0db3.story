Joe Royle, the last man to lead Everton to a trophy back in 1995, has returned to Goodison Park for a third spell at the club.

Having served Everton with distinction as both a player and a manager, Royle will now take a role on Roberto Martinez’s backroom staff with the specific brief of helping young players make the transition from the Academy and Under-21 ranks into the first team.

It is an important appointment as a number of changes have taken place behind the scenes at Goodison this summer, with Academy Director Alan Irvine leaving to take over as manager at West Brom and Alan Stubbs, who had been in charge of the Under-21s, taking the Hibernian manager’s job.

Martinez specifically wanted Royle, who has been described by Chairman Bill Kenwright as 'an Everton giant', to assume the role and discussions had taken place earlier in the year.

Royle, however, was appointed to the role of Foootball Consultant at Norwich last month but after discussions with Neil Adams, his release was granted.

Now that he is officially on Everton’s staff once more, Royle – the former Oldham, Manchester City and Ipswich manager – has spoken of his delight at returning to the club he has supported all his life.

Royle said: ‘It’s great to be back. Everyone knows how much Everton means to me – it has been in my blood for over 50 years. I admire what Roberto achieved in his debut season and I am really looking forward to working alongside him.

‘I made my debut for Everton as a 16-year-old so I understand what it means to be a young player coming through at this football club. I’m looking forward to using my experience to help the players we have here.

‘I was happy with my role at Norwich City and wouldn’t have considered an offer from any other club than Everton. It’s like coming home for me. I’d like to thank Norwich for their co-operation and understanding with this situation and I wish Neil Adams and everyone at Carrow Road all the best for the new season.’

Royle later tweeted: 'Thank you all for the kind comments. So excited to be back. I have been going to Goodison since I was 8 years old & truly honoured.’

Martinez, who has taken his squad to Austria for warm weather training, added: ‘Everyone knows the incredible influence Joe has had at our football club, both as a player and a manager. He is a true Evertonian and we all welcome him back to Goodison Park.  

‘We are all very excited with the talent coming through in our Academy and we pride ourselves on the work we do with the young players. Joe’s experience and football know-how will be hugely beneficial for the youngsters at a key stage of their development.  He is the first major change in our structure in player development.’
