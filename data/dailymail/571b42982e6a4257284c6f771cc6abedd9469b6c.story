Proposal: The unemployed could be made to clean war memorials in return for their benefits, David Cameron announced last night. Above, a worker cleans London's Cenotaph

The unemployed could be made to clean war memorials in return for their benefits, David Cameron announced last night.

As part of a new drive to get those who have been jobless for more than six months back to work, claimants may be told to report for community and charity work.

They could be offered work as gardeners or told to help restore historical sites, giving them the skills to hold down a full-time job.

If they refuse to co-operate, they would lose all or part of their jobseeker’s allowance.

The plans are part of the Help to Work scheme, which comes into force today.  It is targeted at those who have been out of work for months and are having no luck getting a job – or deemed not to be trying hard enough.

Job centre staff will be able to put people on the scheme and could force them to turn up every day to discuss what they have done to look for work.

Until now, these meetings have happened no more frequently than every two weeks.

Mr Cameron said: ‘A key part of our long-term economic plan is to move to full employment, making sure that everyone who can work is in work. We are seeing record levels of employment in Britain, as more and more people find a job, but we need to look at those who are persistently stuck on benefits.

'This scheme will provide more help than ever before, getting people into work and on the road to a more secure future.’ 

There are currently more than 600,000 job vacancies in the UK at any one time. The new measures are designed to ensure that as the economy improves, everyone with the ability to work has the support and the opportunity to do so.

Under the 
scheme, job centre advisors will tailor back-to-work plans for each 
claimant. Those put on Help to Work will have to turn up at the job 
centre every day for a meeting with their adviser to discuss their 
progress. 

As part of the scheme, dole claimants who lack work experience could be put on ‘community work placements’.

These
 would include a range of roles in the voluntary and community sector 
that will give them experience in the workplace – such as gardening 
projects, running community cafes or restoring war memorials.

The
 placements will be for up to six months for 30 hours a week. They will 
be backed by at least four hours of supported job searching each week to
 help turn them into full-time employment.

Other claimants could be given help with travel costs for turning up to interviews, or help to buy suitable interview clothes.

Announcement: Mr Cameron said a key part of the government's long-term economic plan was 'making sure everyone who can work is in work'. He added: 'We need to look at those who are persistently stuck on benefits'

Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said: ‘Everyone with the ability to work should be given the support and opportunity to do so. 

‘The previous system wrote too many people off, which was a huge waste of potential. 

‘We are now seeing record numbers of people in jobs and the largest fall in long-term unemployment since 1998.

‘But there’s always more to do, which is why we are introducing this new scheme to provide additional support to the very small minority of claimants who have been unemployed for a number of years. In this way we will ensure that they too can benefit from the improving jobs market.’ 

Help to Work will be mandatory. Those who fail to participate could lose their jobseeker’s allowance for four weeks for  a first failure and 13 weeks  for a second.
