For Hillary Clinton, having her own baby grandchild to kiss on the campaign trail, could be one of the biggest boosts to her possible presidential election campaign.

Although the former Secretary of State and First Lady has not said if she will run in 2016, the arrival of her first grandchild will soften her image, analysts have said.

While Chelsea only revealed her pregnancy on Thursday, supporters of her mother have already started cooing over a possible baby in the White House.

Excited: Hillary Clinton looked delighted at her daughter's news

With the Clintons having a near-royal status in the U.S., the announcement of a new arrival due this fall has sent ripples across media outlets and political forums.

'My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be!,' Mrs Clinton had tweeted yesterday.

But some, such as Republican strategist Michael 
Goldfarb, have highlighted the 'perfect timing' of the pregnancy, tweeting: 'Just in time for HRC to have a baby on stage with her
 when she announces she’s running, right?'

On MSNBC Andrew Ross Sorkin, a guest on the morning show, said Friday : 'Can we talk about the human drama that is Grandma Clinton?'

'I don't want to be cynical and I'm not suggesting anyone's having a baby for election purposes, but ...' the New York Times columnist added before the panel drowned him out.

Softened: Analysts say becoming a grandma could change the dynamic of a campaign for Hillary

Mr Sorkin went on to say the arrival of the youngest member of the Clinton family could change the dynamic of the election campaign, and would be a closely watched story.

'I think it’s different because the country is invested in this family ... I just think you are gonna see babies around the campaign,' he said. 'It just adds this whole element of compassion.'

Supporters
 of a Clinton run for the White House in 2016 have certainly welcomed 
the news, posting messages of congratulations on Chelsea's Facebook 
page, the Los Angeles Times reported.

'I am sure your Mom will love having a grandchild
 running around the White House with her!' one post read.

Another said: 'The first grandchild to be raised in the White house! Hillary giving 
the baby a bottle while giving a press conference. How wonderful!'

For Mrs Clinton however, the joy of finally becoming a grandmother appears to be the only thing on her mind.

Former 
President Bill Clinton spoke of their desire to be grandparents back in 
2011, saying: 'I'd like to be a grandfather ... I would like to have a 
happy wife, and she won't be unless she's a grandmother.

'It's something she wants more than she wanted to be president.'

The former
 First Family were congratulated on their grandparents-to-be status by 
another former First Family, with Laura Bush tweeting: 'BillClinton and 
@HillaryClinton, grandchildren are the greatest gift. @ChelseaClinton 
& Marc will be wonderful parents!'

Jenna Bush, who had her first baby last year and, like Chelsea was a First Daughter, also sent congratulations.

She tweeted yesterday: 'Congratulations @ChelseaClinton! Welcome to the best club in the world. Mamahood is wonderful. Xx'.
