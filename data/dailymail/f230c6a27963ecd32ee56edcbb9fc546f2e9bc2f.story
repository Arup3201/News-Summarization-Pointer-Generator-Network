Hospital are to carry out Ebola drills this weekend to ensure they are well prepared to deal with infected patients.

Simulation exercises are taking place in at least two major trusts – one in the north, one in the south – although others may be instructed to follow suit.

At each, an actor will pretend to be a patient struck down with the virus and staff will have to act quickly to ensure it doesn’t spread.

Yesterday A&E units across the country were given guidelines telling them to have specialist protective clothing on standby including masks, goggles and gowns.

The drills will likely take place at a hospital with a specialist infectious disease department, such as the Royal Free in North London (pictured)

Yet staff at some hospitals say they haven’t yet received these even though they should have been delivered within the past few months.

As part of the drills, the mock patient will turn up at a GP surgery or an A&E unit with mock early symptoms including a fever, muscle ache and sickness.

Doctors are meant to ask ‘have you travelled recently?’ and if the patient has been to countries such as Sierra Leone, Guinea or Liberia – immediately suspect they have Ebola.

Staff will quickly put on protective clothing and the patient will be taken by ambulance to the hospital where the drill is taking place.

Once they have been dropped off, the ambulance will be thoroughly decontaminated with a powerful chemical called hypochlorite – comprised of chlorine and oxygen

All staff across the trust will have been warned beforehand that the drill is taking place by email and text alerts.

But many may only get a few hours’ notice – especially those working on other wards or in the canteen who won't be directly involved.

Patients and relatives will also be informed that an exercise is under way – although they may not necessarily say that it is an ‘Ebola drill’ just in case it creates a sense of panic.

The Department of Health – which is overseeing the drills – will not to disclose which hospitals they are taking place so as not to alarm the public and to keep it as realistic as possible.

But they will most probably take place at one of four which has a specialist infectious disease department.

These include the Royal Free in North London, The Royal Liverpool, the Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield and the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Throughout the drill, officials will be checking that staff are taking all the appropriate steps to prevent the spread of the virus – and minimise panic amongst the general public.

The patient will be transferred to a make-shift isolation unit which will involve a tent being set up around the bed to contain the infection, whilst still enabling the patient to breath.

The Royal Free has the country’s only high level isolation unit – with just two beds – and air is specially filtered to prevent the spread of the infection.

Writing for the The New York Times, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy a the University of Minnesota, said those experts are loath to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria. 

Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.'  

But the chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate.

He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the Ebola virus will change over time.

Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' 

But Professor Heymann, told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus.

'I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus.

'The virus's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions, which is exactly the same as other past epidemics. 

But last month three other trusts, the Royal Liverpool, the Royal Hallamshire and the Royal Victoria were instructed to make contingency plans in case there was a sudden surge of patients.

These are likely to have included setting up make-shift isolation units.

Public health officials in the nearby area will also work out how best to alert members of the public who may have come into contact with the patient without causing mass panic.

Ministers agreed to carry out the drills during Wednesday’s Cobra chaired by David Cameron.

The exact details are still being finalised by the Department of Health including at how many trusts they will take place and on which day, Saturday or Sunday.
