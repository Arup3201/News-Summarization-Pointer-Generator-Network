He has called it the ‘biggest mistake of my life’.

But 18 months after his affair with his American co-star left his marriage and career in tatters, TV baker Paul Hollywood’s fortunes appear to be rising.

The 48-year-old heart-throb is thought to have made more dough in the last financial year than ever before – almost £1million.

Not only is he judging BBC1’s The Great British Bake Off with Mary Berry but he has also embarked on a string of lucrative live tours.

On top of that, he has published three best-selling baking books, lined up new TV work and released his own range of merchandise online.

It is a far cry from 2011, when his company, Paul Hollywood Ltd, made a paltry £547.

This then grew to £409,728 the following year – before his affair with Marcela Valladolid, his 36-year-old co-star on his US television series, threatened to ruin it all.

His show, the American Baking Competition, was dropped while his marriage to his wife Alexandra appeared to be hanging in the balance.

Since then, however, Hollywood has succeeded in turning his life around. After reconciling with Alexandra, 50, at the end of last year, he has concentrated on making the most of his media profile.

The presenter, who has yet to publish his accounts for the last financial year, drives a £135,000 Aston Martin DB9 and owns a Ducati motorbike.

Here’s how he has cashed in on his fame:

He is paid an estimated £300,000 to present his BBC shows. As well as judging Bake Off, he has hosted two spin-offs: Paul Hollywood’s Bread and Paul Hollywood’s Pies and Puds.

Last month, it emerged he had been lined up to present another, as yet unnamed, show about motoring for the BBC.

In the past three years, Hollywood has published three books, which became best-sellers.

To maximise sales, each was released to coincide with his television projects. The first two books, How to Bake and Bread sold more than 275,000 copies between them.

His latest, Pies and Puds, which tied in with his 20-part BBC2 series, came second in the Christmas bestsellers list and has sold more than 100,000 to date.

Hollywood set up a new company, PJH Media, last year to channel the profits of his growing media empire.

Last year, Hollywood also started selling a range of personalised merchandise on his personal website. A T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan Get Your Bake On costs £15, while hoodies are £35.

Fans can also buy a spoon and whisk keychain for £7. Tea towel sets cost £8, tote bags sell for £8 each, while signed tour programmes are £13.

Earlier this year, Hollywood toured up and down the country with his sell-out Get Your Bake On! masterclasses.

The 23-date tour saw him mix baking advice and demonstrations with smutty puns and innuendo, shocking and delighting his largely female audience.

He is launching another 27-date tour this autumn, with tickets costing from £32.40 for a basic seat to £84.75 for a VIP package.

This includes a complimentary welcome drink and a welcome goodie bag, as well as the chance to meet Hollywood before the show.

The only part of Hollywood’s empire which is not booming is, ironically, his baking business.

Earlier this year, it emerged he had closed down his artisan bakery after it ran up nearly £60,000 in debts.
