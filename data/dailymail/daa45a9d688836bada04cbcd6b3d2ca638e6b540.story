Virgin Trains lost its lucrative West Coast mainline franchise yesterday and its boss, Sir Richard Branson, immediately predicted the winning rail operator would ‘go bankrupt’ as a result.

Virgin Trains has run the service from London to Scotland for 14 years, but was beaten by FirstGroup in a bidding process the tycoon described as ‘insane’.

Sir Richard said the winning £6.5billion deal was ‘verging on suicidal’ and vowed never to bid for a rail franchise again unless David Cameron personally apologises to him.

Blow: Sir Richard Branson's train company has lost its West Coast franchise but has today vowed to run it for free if Labour manages to halt the contract being signed by FirstGroup tomorrow

FirstGroup has promised better 
services and cheaper fares. Ministers insisted the bid had been ‘tested’
 and found to be ‘robust’, accusing Sir Richard of ‘amnesia’ over his 
own rail firm’s failures.

But the Virgin tycoon said travellers
 will be the losers from what he feared would be a string of broken 
promises leading to big fare rises and worsening services.

Unions and Labour agreed and even the
 City appeared to share his concerns as shares in FirstGroup – Britain’s
 biggest train operator – plummeted.

Among his unlikely allies is the 
militant RMT union which called the deal ‘a total con’ and is 
threatening industrial action over feared job losses.

Sir Richard said FirstGroup had bid 
£750million more than his own Virgin Trains but claimed this was ‘too 
much’ and predicted FirstGroup would back out before the end of the 
contract.

Yesterday’s decision also sparked a 
row over the true cost of the winning bid – the Department for Transport
 claimed FirstGroup had bid £5.5billion.

But when challenged by the Mail it 
admitted that the true figure was at least £1billion more when a key 
20-month extension clause is counted.

Unions believe FirstGroup and the 
Government had tried to ‘spin’ the figures to prevent jitters in the 
City and concern among taxpayers.

Stung by the criticisms, Transport 
Minister Theresa Villiers accused Sir Richard of ‘amnesia’ about the 
poor performance and troubles his own franchises, Virgin West Coast and 
Cross Country, had faced in the past.

She insisted the new franchise would 
deliver ‘big improvements for passengers with more seats and plans for 
more services’ and passenger satisfaction targets included for the first
 time.

The minister stressed that FirstGroup
 will face penalties totalling £265million in bonds and guarantees if it
 ‘walks away’ early – a sum critics deride as ‘peanuts.’

First Group says it will cut the 
price of the most expensive standard ‘Anytime’ fares by 15 per cent over
 the first two years, but passengers will still face 
Government-sanctioned inflation-busting rises of up to 11 per cent on 
regulated fares.

Action: RMT general secretary Bob Crow says the union is already preparing a ballot for industrial action over threatened job cuts while Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said 'big improvements for passengers' were planned

Upset: Sir Richard has taken to Twitter to express his frustration with the decision suggesting FirstGroup offered way too much money for the franchise while accusing the government of 'insanity' in its decision

National Express was awarded the East Coast franchise in 2007 - a year after the Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) was forced to quit the franchise in 2006 because of financial problems.

It agreed to pay the government £1.4bn to run the East Coast main line, which runs between Edinburgh and London, until 2015.

It was operated by a subsidiary of National Express, NXEC, which is a stand-alone company.

At the time, many rail analysts said it had paid too much for the franchise.

NXEC assumed that revenue from fares would rise by around 10 per cent a year.

However, in 2009 it went up by a recession-hit 0.3 per cent, and as a result National Express lost £20million in the first six months.

The firm was told by its lawyers that it could walk away from the contract, and lose a maximum of £72million as a result.

The government eventually stripped the firm of its contract in 2009 after it failed to make contracted payments.

Whitehall announced it would temporarily re-nationalise the franchise before re-tendering in 2010.

In a strongly-worded statement, Sir 
Richard said that he was ‘extremely disappointed’ with the franchise 
decision made by the Department for Transport.

He said GNER and National Express had been hit with bankruptcy after they ‘overbid’ for the East Coast mainline franchise.

He went on: ‘Sadly, the Government 
has chosen to take that risk with FirstGroup and we only hope they will 
continue to drive dramatic improvements on this line for years to come 
without letting everybody down.’

Sir Richard, who is currently on his 
private island of Necker in the British Virgin Islands, added that this 
was the fourth time Virgin had been outbid in a franchise tender 
process.

He went on: ‘On the past three 
occasions, the winning operator has come nowhere close to delivering 
their promised plans and revenue, and has let the public and country 
down dramatically.

‘GNER and National Express 
over-promised in order to win the franchise and spectacularly ran into 
financial difficulties in trying to deliver their plans.

‘The East Coast is still in 
Government ownership and its service is outdated and underinvested, 
costing passengers and the country dearly as a result.

‘Insanity is doing the same thing 
over and over again and expecting different results. When will the 
Department for Transport learn?’

He said he had not made ‘a fuss’ when
 Virgin Trains lost three previous bids, but said: ‘On this occasion I 
feel enough is enough.’

He was now considering legal action and would leave ‘no stone unturned.’

Ministers say the new franchise will provide an extra 12,000 seats from 11 new six-car electric trains from December 2016.

FirstGroup chief executive Tim O’Toole said his company would be making ‘significant improvements, including reduced journey times, and introducing new direct services’. He insisted: ‘Our track record is that we do deliver.’

By RUTH SUNDERLAND

Sir Richard Branson is extremely talented at two things – making piles of money from his Virgin brand and feuding.

His list of previous enemies includes BA boss Willie Walsh and the former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns, who thwarted his bid to win the National Lottery franchise.

So it was predictable that he would 
unleash a torrent of fury when Virgin Rail lost the West Coast operating
 franchise to FirstGroup yesterday.

The decision, Branson said, was pure ‘insanity.’

He claimed FirstGroup 
had bid far too much for the franchise and risked exposing passengers to
 poorer service and bigger fares.

The Government says benefits of the new franchise will include:

- Around 12,000 extra seats a day when the new 11 six-car electric trains come into service

- 106 extra Pendolino carriages which will deliver more than 28,000 extra daily seats

- A number of new services including a London Euston to Blackpool service from 2013 and, from 2016, services from London to Telford Central, Shrewsbury and Bolton

- Journey time improvements between London and Glasgow are planned, as well as additional services from London to Preston.

- First West Coast will spend at least £22 million on a station investment programme.

FirstGroup, he suggested, was likely to suffer a similar fate to 
previous franchise bidders who had over-reached themselves and ended up 
in financial difficulty, letting down customers and the country as a 
whole.

This might strike some as a bit rich coming from a man whose potentially
 lucrative takeover of Northern Rock  could leave the Treasury with a 
£400million loss.

Tim O’Toole, the chief executive of FirstGroup, reckons Branson is a bad
 loser. ‘If he had won, he would just be cashing a very large cheque on 
Necker Island,’ O’Toole said yesterday.

So who is right? The reaction from the stock market seemed to come down on the side of Branson.

Shares in FirstGroup sank like a stone, losing six per cent of their 
value. By contrast, Stagecoach, Branson’s joint venture partner in 
Virgin Rail, saw its shares rise almost two per cent.

The stock market, though, is notoriously volatile and a cool  analysis 
of the proposals suggests there is less of a gulf between the bids than 
Branson’s outburst might suggest.

FirstGroup has pledged to return £5.5bn to the Government over the life 
of the franchise, while Virgin offered £4.8bn. Whether or not FirstGroup
 will actually be able to make this payment, of course,  depends on how 
much revenue it can extract from passengers.

It reckons it can squeeze out growth of 10.4 per cent a year, compared 
with the 10.2 per cent Virgin made over the past decade and the 8.5 per 
cent growth target it set.

That is a tall order, Virgin has already transformed  a line that had 
been a basket case, meaning there is less scope for future improvements.

FirstGroup insists it can deliver  by providing more seats on more 
trains. As for the threat to services and jobs, it  argues Virgin’s bid 
involved paring £45million from costs, double the amount of cost-cutting
 FirstGroup is proposing.

The stakes in this row are very high. If it turns out that FirstGroup 
has indeed overplayed its hand, it may well end up taking an axe to 
jobs.

As a nuclear option, it could simply walk away from the franchise, admittedly with a £265million penalty.

Passengers could be forgiven for thinking that both sides in this row 
are as bad as each other, while they are merely piggybank in the middle.
