Donald Sterling is expected to make a 'last-ditch' bid to remain in the NBA as officials gather today to discuss his expulsion from the sport.

The disgraced LA Clippers owner is set launch a stiff legal challenge to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's vow to force him to sell the team.

Mr Silver has already banned Sterling from the NBA for life and imposed a maximum $2.5million fine in response to alleged racist remarks about black players.

Legal battle: LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, left, has reportedly instructed his long-time attorney Robert Platt, right, to fight moves by the NBA to force him to sell up over the racism scandal which has engulfed him

The scandal broke over the weekend when a celebrity news website released audio allegedly of Sterling criticising an ex-girlfriend for associating with 'black people', including stars such as Earvin 'Magic' Johnson.

Now a source tells the New York Post that Sterling has instructed his long-time attorney Robert Platt to fight the NBA's moves to excise him from the sport.

Mr Platt previously successfully defended Sterling against an lawsuit claiming racial discrimination brought by the Clippers' general manager Elgin Baylor in 2009.

The unnamed source told NY Post reporters Fred Kerber and Josh Kosman: 'I think it will be one last-ditch effort for both billionaire Sterling and millionaire Platt.'

Swift action: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver speaks during a press conference in New York City where he announced that the NBA is banning Sterling from the sport for life over the alleged racist remarks

The move comes ahead of a first 
meeting of the advisory finance committee of the NBA board today, which 
will review the next steps in forcing Sterling to sell the Clippers.

Two
 of the league's 29 other team owners, including the governing board's 
chairman, have already said they expected to reach the three-quarters 
majority vote needed to expel Sterling fully, a move unprecedented in 
NBA history.

According to 
NBA bylaws, Mr Silver must present Sterling with a written copy of any 
allegations within three days, and Sterling would have five days to 
answer.

A special hearing of
 the Board of Governors, consisting of all the owners, would then be 
held on a date no more than 10 days after Sterling's reply.

But it now seems that Sterling, who bought the Clippers in 1981 for $13 million when the team was based in San Diego, will not go without a fight.

If owners vote against him, is seems likely that he would seek a temporary restraining order which could lead to an injunction that would keep the case in court for years.  

Glamorous: The taped conversation is said to have recorded remarks made by Sterling to Vanessa Stiviano, a model of mixed African American and Mexican heritage with whom he has often been seen

Sterling was stripped of his seat on 
the board as part of the lifetime ban for the 'deeply offensive and 
harmful' racial views he was said to have expressed in audio recordings 
released over the weekend.

Neither
 Sterling nor his representatives have commented on the tapes, in which a
 voice said to be his is heard criticising a female friend for 
'associating with black people.'

The
 female friend was said to be Vanessa Stiviano, a 31-year-old model of 
mixed African American and Mexican heritage who has often been seen by 
Sterling's side.

She has denied being the source of the recording.

Centre of attention: News of the recordings drew outrage from players, fans, politicians - including President Barack Obama - and sponsors, several of whom said they were cutting ties with the team

Mr Silver said on Tuesday that Sterling has acknowledged to the NBA that the recording was authentic but did not apologise for the remarks.

News of the recordings drew outrage from players, fans, politicians - including President Barack Obama - and sponsors, several of whom said they were cutting ties with the team, even after the NBA moved to remove Sterling.

The ban imposed on Tuesday prohibits Sterling from any ties with the Clippers organisation or the league as a whole and bars him from ever again attending NBA games or practices.

Sterling, the longest-tenured of the NBA's 30 owners, also was excluded from any team business or player personnel decisions and was fined $2.5 million, the league's maximum monetary penalty.

Asked whether Sterling, 80, could end up an absentee owner if the governing board declined to force a team sale, Mr Silver said: 'I fully expect to get the support I need from the other NBA owners to remove him.'
