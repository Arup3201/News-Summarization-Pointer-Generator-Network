Bookmakers across the country have been celebrating after pocketing around £50m in bets after this weekend's Grand National race.

But the unlikely victory for 66/1 winner Auroras Encore has reportedly cost one £50,000.

Spread betting firm Sporting Index had initially predicted the race winner’s starting price would be between 18/1 and 20/1.

But when the horse - a 'skinner' at 66/1 - came in first, punters who bought that spread made 46 times their money.

Spread betting sees punters bet 'high or low' on a range of outcomes of an event.

The pay-off is based on the accuracy of the wager, rather than a simple 'win or lose' outcome.

A spread is a range of outcomes and the bet is whether the outcome will be above or below the spread.

The real loss for the bookmakers came because it also offered a bet multiplying the starting price by the margin of victory, offering a spread of 135-145.

As the horse was a 66/1 long shot and won by a comfortable nine lengths, some 
punters made 449 times their stake, with one landing £22,450 after 
buying the spread at £50 per point. 

Wayne Lincoln, Sporting Index's trading spokesman, said it was 'highly unusual for a bookies to lose on the Grand National'.

He added: 'Sporting Index are a spread betting firm that offer weird and wonderful markets on events like the Grand National.

'They're based a host of predictions and they challenge their clients to bet higher or lower on them

'We were predicting that the Grand National woulld be won by 20/1 shot.

'What has cost us a lot of money is that it was won by a 60/1 shot.

He said: 'The fixed-odds bookies couldn’t have wished for a better result, but Auroras Encore was an absolute nightmare for us.

He added: 'We were taken to the cleaners when Mon Mome won this race at 100/1 in 2009 and it’s a similar story this year.'
