The failed Great Escape mission was worth the human cost because it boosted the morale of the soldiers left behind in the Nazi prisoner of war camp, according to surviving veterans.

Jack Lyon, 96, and Charles Clarke, 90, were young RAF officers shot down
 in separate missions and imprisoned in the infamous Stalag Luft III camp during the 
Second World War.

Mr Lyon kept surveillance on the camp's Luftwaffe guards during 
construction of escape tunnels and was waiting to make his getaway in 
the early hours of March 25, 1944 when the daring mission was 
discovered.

Once they were recaptured, 50 Allied PoWs were executed 
by the Gestapo, but their astonishing bid for freedom from the camp, now then in south east Germany but now in Poland, was immortalised 
on the silver screen in the 1963 film The Great Escape.

'It was a costly operation but not necessarily unsuccessful,' said Mr Lyon, who lives in East Sussex, speaking at a Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund event to mark the 70th anniversary of the mission.

'It did do a lot for morale, particularly for those prisoners who'd been there for a long time.

'They felt they were able to contribute something, even if they weren't able to get out.

'They felt they could help in some way and trust me, in prison camps, morale is very important.'

The veterans were joined for a special screening of the 1963 film by wilderness survival expert Ray Mears and comedian Al Murray.

Mr Clarke, who lives in London, said: 'I think it's often forgotten that the Great Escape was probably one of the most audacious operations that the RAF carried out.

'When you see what was achieved with limited resources... When you think that all the equipment they had had to be made. The air pump was made of a kit bag and a few other bits.

'The air pipes were made of powdered milk tins, and even the little fat lamps were made of boiled margarine.'

The plan for the Great Escape took shape in the spring of 1943 when Squadron Leader Roger Bushell RAF, who had been a lawyer in his civilian life, hatched a strategy for a major breakout.

Bushell, who came to be known by the codename Big X, created an Escape Committee and inspired the camp's Allied prisoners in an attempt to get in excess of 200 out.

Some 600 men helped dig three tunnels, which were referred to as Tom, Dick and Harry, with the hope that one would succeed.

Tunnel Tom started in a darkened corner of one of the building's halls, while Dick's entrance was hidden in a washroom drain sump and Harry's was under a stove.

The plan was for the escapees to come out the other end with civilian clothes, forged papers and escape equipment.

On the night of March 24 to 25 March 1944, 76 men took advantage of a moonless night to attempt get away through tunnel Harry.

Steve McQueen led a star-studded cast which included Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Garner and Donald Pleasance in a dramatised version of the men's story two decades later.

Speaking at the anniversary event in central London, RAF Benevolent Fund Controller Air Marshal Chris Nickols said it had been an honour to hear Mr Lyon and Mr Clarke's memories.

He said: 'They remind us that The Great Escape is much more than a just a movie; it was a remarkable feat of courage and resourcefulness, which sadly resulted in 50 men being killed.'

In the spring of 1943, RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bushell conceived a plan for a major escape from the German Stalag Luft III Camp near Sagan, now Żagań in Poland.

With the escape planned for the night of March 24, 1944, the PoWs built three 30ft deep tunnels, named Tom, Dick and Harry, so that if one was discovered by the German guards, they would not suspect that work was underway on two more.

Bushell intended to get more than 200 men through the tunnels, each wearing civilian clothes and possessing a complete range of forged papers and escape equipment.

To hide the earth dug from the tunnels the prisoners attached pouches of the sand inside their trousers so that as they walked around it would scatter.

The prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges made by the sand and were referred to as 'penguins' because of their supposed resemblance to the animal.

When the attempt began it was discovered that Harry had come up short and instead of reaching into a nearby forest, the first man in fact emerged just short of the tree line, close to a guard tower. Plans for one man to leave every minute was reduced to 10 per hour.

In total 76 men crawled through to initial freedom, but the 77th was spotted by a guard. In the hunt for the entrance one guard Charlie Pilz crawled through the tunnel but after becoming trapped at the other end called for help. The prisoners opened the entrance, revealing the location.

Of the escapees 73 were captured, and 50 of them executed.THE HOLLYWOOD FILMThe 1963 film The Great Escape was based on real events, and although some characters were fictitious many were based on real people, or amalgams of several of those involved.

The film starred Steve McQueen as Captain Virgil Hilts, James Garner as Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley and Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, and was based on a book of the same name by Paul Brickhill.

Contrary to the film no American PoWs were involved in the escape attempt, and there were no escapes by motorcycle or aircraft.

Hilts' dash for the border by motorcycle was added by request of McQueen, who did the stunt riding himself except for the final jump.
