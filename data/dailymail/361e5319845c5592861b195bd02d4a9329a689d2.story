A volunteer searcher who broke his back while looking for a teenager who was lost in Orange County wilderness says he deserves restitution if the teen is convicted on drug charges.

Nick Papageorge, 20, said after Nic Cendoya's arraignment was postponed Wednesday that his medical bills could total $350,000, City News Service reported.

Papageorge searched Trabuco Canyon's woods with other members of the Orange County sheriff's volunteer search team when Cendoya, 19, and his friend Kyndall Jack, 18, went missing on Easter Sunday.

Serious: Mr Papageorge's was injured, breaking his back, in a 110 foot fall while helping in the search for Nicolas Cendoya, one of two lost teenage hikers during a four-day search of the rugged terrain of eastern Orange County in April

They called for help after wandering off trail in the Cleveland National Forest. Cendoya was found three days later and Jack was found the following day. Both were dehydrated and delirious.

Papageorge says that while searching for the pair, he fell 110 feet in the steep terrain and bounced off a rocky cliff twice, breaking his back.

Papageorge displayed X-rays of his injured back Wednesday, saying doctors implanted two titanium rods and 11 screws to repair his spine.

Treatment: 'I start physical therapy this week and I'm very thankful to be here,' said Papageorge, adding that he doesn't wish ill on Cendoya

'I start physical therapy this week 
and I'm very thankful to be here,' said Papageorge, adding that he 
doesn't wish ill on Cendoya.

Authorities said methamphetamine was found in Cendoya's car as they investigated the pair's disappearance.

If convicted of felony drug possession, he could get up to three years in prison.

Both recalled little from their ordeal, beyond hallucinations.

Jack said that she had wild thoughts her 
parents had been sentenced to prison time, a python was eating her and 
that Cendoya had told her he was having visions of a tiger.

Jack was rescued shoeless and clinging 
to a mountain ledge on April 4 having suffered frostbite and cuts and 
bruises on her legs that made walking difficult for her.

'I don't remember drinking anything,' said Jack to ABC News.
'I know I ate dirt. I tried to eat some dirt and rocks. I came to the 
hospital with a big mouthful of dirt and that's all I remember.'

Delerious: Kyndall Jack, 18,  was with Cendoya.  She is pictured, left before she went missing and right after she was released from hospital following treatment. Both were dehydrated and delirious were they were found

Describing
her hallucinations, Jack said that the wilderness got to her, making 
her imagine that animals were trying to attack her and her companion.

'My
parents were in jail half the time, in my mind, and I was searching for
my little sister, so that's all I remember,' said Jack.

'I was being eaten by a python. Like Nick saw a tiger, I was being eaten by a python half the time.'

It was while at the top of a mountain
that took them six hours that the inexperienced hikers realized they 
had exhausted the water supply.

'We wanted to touch the clouds,' said Jack. 'That's why we went up there. We wanted to be in the clouds at the top.'

And in newly released 911 calls made as the panicked pair realized they were stranded, Cendoya sounds incoherent.

'We
have fire I mean,' Cendoya told the 911 operator according to ABC News.
'I mean we have a lighter or something we can light something up. I 
don't know.'

The 911 operator can be heard to struggle with Cendoya as he tries to find out where the pair have got themselves lost.

'Stop for one second. What is the address?' Cendoya can be overheard saying to Jack.

'I don't know,' she replies.

Jack told reporters that the battery 
on Cendoya's cellphone failed before the 911 operator could track the 
signal - and that is when they began to panic.

'I
said just hold onto me. Let's go back down the canyon,' Cendoya said after being released from hospital. 'And I must've fallen. And I 
don't know if Kyndall took a fall and was unconscious.'

Once separated, the two were unaware even if the other one had survived.

Cendoya
was found barefoot, shirtless and disorientated and Jack was found the 
next morning handing from a rocky ledge the size of a yoga mat.

The search for Cendoya and Jack cost Orange County an estimated $160,000.

Last week, county officials decided they don't have the authority to seek reimbursement from the pair, but they're now seeking to change that.

Supervisors voted Tuesday to propose state legislation that would charge reckless people for the cost of rescuing them.

Assemblyman Don Wagner has agreed to carry a bill, which permits counties and cities to recover rescue costs for people who put themselves in peril through illegal or reckless acts.
