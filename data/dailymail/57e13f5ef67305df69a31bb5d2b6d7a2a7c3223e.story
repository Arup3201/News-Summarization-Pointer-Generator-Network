It was referred to as the 'ranch' by newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst - a rather misleading term of endearment for his 165-room castle that took 28 years to design and build.

Hearst worked with architect Julia Morgan from 1919 to create the grand property in San Simeon, California. It was developed in 127 acres of land that the media magnate inherited from his wealthy family, and completed in 1947. The palatial home is nestled amid gardens, pools, terraces and walkways.

Hearst made his money in newspapers and magazines before expanding into politics. He was believed to be the inspiration behind Orson Welles' film Citizen Kane.

Palace paradise: The castle was built for publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst high on a hill half way between San Francisco and Los Angeles and was completed in 1947

He was only able to enjoy his 
magnificent castle for a brief time before having to leave the remote location, several hundred miles from both San Francisco and Los Angeles,
 for medical care in the same year that the property was completed. Hearst 
died in Beverly Hills on August 14, 1951, at the age of 88.

The castle was bequeathed to the state of California in 1957 and opened to the public. It attracts around one million visits each year thanks to its plethora of antiques and substantial art collection - despite its remote location, high on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

Hearst, who ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York but was twice elected to the House of Representatives, officially named the estate La Cuesta Encantada, 'The Enchanted Hill'.

However he lovingly dubbed it the 'ranch' because the castle was built on Rancho Piedra Blanca - land that Hearst's father, George Hearst, bought in 1865 after making his fortune in mining.

William Hearst originally approached architect 
Julia Morgan in 1915 with plans for a modest bungalow. The tycoon
 loved the views from the estate so much but felt he had become too old 
to go camping in the hills.

Morgan,
 who had studied at the distinguished Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, 
designed more than 700 buildings in California during her long career. 
However she is best known for the stamp she made on what was to become 
Hearst Castle. 

The castle and surrounding buildings are a mix of European architectural styles that appealed to Hearst on his travels. In total, Hearst Castle has 56 bedrooms, 61 bathrooms and 19 sitting rooms. 

There are 127 acres of manicured gardens along with numerous indoor and outdoor pools. The tiled indoor pool, for example, draws from the Roman tradition of baths and is lined with statues of gods, goddesses and heroes. Tennis courts, a movie theater, airport, wine cellar and a one-time private zoo completed the estate. 

While Hearst Castle was in the process of being completed in the 1920s and 30s, invitations were highly conveted by the Hollywood elite.

Among the distinguished guests who graced its majestic halls were Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.

Pastiche: Hearst Castle incorporates a mixture of historic European styles influenced by the tycoon's travels on the continent

Fountain of wealth: The estate took more than 28 years to build and was funded by William Hearst's media empire

Hearst Castle was the inspiration for 
the 'Xanadu' mansion of the 1941 Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which 
was itself a fictionalization of William Randolph Hearst's life. 
However the castle was not used as a location for the film.

One of the conditions for the property being opened up to the public was that the Hearst family were still allowed to use the estate. They reportedly continue to use the original house built on the estate in the late-19th century as a retreat.

This Friday the castle will revive some of its old-school Hollywood glamour by hosting a screening of Citizen Kane at the theater in the grounds along with an exhibition from Hollywood photographer Timothy White. For added glitz, Harrison Ford is also expected to attend the public event.
