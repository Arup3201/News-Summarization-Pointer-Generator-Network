Flying winger Jesus Navas says he will not adapt his game at Manchester City, insisting he is told by Manuel Pellegrini to stay wide and use his pace.

Navas has prominently featured for  champions but hasn't scored in the Premier League this season.

That may be because the Spain international doesn't drift in-field as much as team-mates Samir Nasri and David Silva, though he says he has played this way since he was a youngster at Sevilla and he won't change.

Speaking exclusively to Bleacher Report, the 29-year-old said: 'The way I play is the way I have always played. 

'That is what got me here, always trying to get on the wing and play fast. That is my game, and that's what I am asked to do and what I try to do in every match, so I don't feel I have had to really adapt my game too much.'

Navas also insisted that City aren't giving up on the dream of retaining their title, despite Chelsea leading the Manchester club by six points with a game in hand.

He added: 'I think there are many games left. Until it is impossible to come back, we will look to close the gap, but we realise it is going to be difficult, but there is a chance.

'If I could change anything or bring anything, it would be the sun and weather from Seville.'
