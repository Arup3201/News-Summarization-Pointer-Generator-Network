Jonathan Trott 'didn't con anyone'

Trott is a victim of cricket's scheduling

Trott timeline: Fall from grace

Jonathan Trott is taking another break from cricket after suffering the same mental issues that forced him to return home early from the Ashes tour. 

The batsman withdrew from England’s disastrous winter series after the first Test in Brisbane with what the ECB described as a ‘stress-related illness’.

He took a four-month break, working with the ECB medical team and a psychologist in an effort to rebuild his career. But after just one LV County Championship Division One game for Warwickshire, in which he scored 37 and 26 in a losing cause against Sussex, the 32-year-old has stepped away from the game again.

Ill again: Jonathan Trott's stress-related anxiety has returned

Out of action: Trott had to fly home from the Ashes tour Down Under because of the condition

Jonathan Trott:

'It was with the best intentions and hope that I returned to cricket with Warwickshire this month.

'Much to my disappointment, since my first game, I have felt the same anxieties that occurred during my time in Australia.

'It is not fair on my team-mates or myself to continue when I am unable to function at 100 per cent. In order to play at the highest level you have to be at 100 per cent and be able to concentrate fully at all times. Sadly I am unable to do this.

'With this in mind I have decided it is best for all involved that I continue my recovery on the sidelines for the time being.

'I would like to thank Warwickshire and the ECB for their continued support through this time.'

ECB and Warwickshire:

'At the completion of the LV=CC match between Warwickshire and Sussex on April 16, 2014 - in which he played - Jonathan experienced a repeat of stress-related symptoms which were diagnosed during England's Ashes series in Australia in the winter.

'Jonathan will now undergo further treatment to assist with his long-term rehabilitation.

'Both parties confirm that their primary concerns are for Jonathan's health and well-being, and reiterate that they will continue to offer him their full support.'

Dr Nick Peirce, the ECB's chief medical officer:

'Jonathan has had a recurrence of the stress related illness that ruled him out of all cricket this winter from late November onwards. 

'Despite Jonathan wanting to play for Warwickshire from the start of the season, having spent time with him yesterday [Thursday] it is clear that he will benefit from a further period away from the game. He will continue with the comprehensive support programme the ECB has put in place to assist his rehabilitation.'

It is understood this has been a far from easy decision to take for the emotional Trott, but his anxiety levels have been so high that he felt he had no choice for his own wellbeing.

Senior English cricket sources told Sportsmail last night that an announcement is expected in the next 24 hours. Trott was unavailable for comment on Thursday night.

The news will spark fears the brilliant career of England’s No 3 batsman could be over, but Trott hopes more specialist treatment will enable him to return. 

In a recent interview, Trott  said he felt he was suffering from ‘burn-out’. But a four-month break has done little to ease the anxiety he appears to be suffering when trying to do his job. 

In November, as news broke of Trott leaving the Ashes tour, he said: ‘I don’t think it is right that I’m playing knowing that I’m not 100 per cent.’

England coach Andy Flower added at the time: ‘He needs time away from this environment and time with his family.’

Former England captain Michael 
Vaughan later criticised Trott after the batsman gave a TV interview 
which raised questions about the nature of his problem.

‘I
 feel a little bit conned we were told Jonathan Trott’s problems in 
Australia were a stress-related illness he had suffered for years,’ 
Vaughan wrote in a newspaper article.

‘We were allowed to believe he was struggling with a serious mental health issue and treated him with sensitivity and sympathy. 

He was obviously not in a great place 
but he was struggling for cricketing reasons and not mental, and there 
is a massive difference.’

Trott batted in all 10 innings when 
England retained the Ashes last summer, averaging 29, but he was 
dismissed for 10 and nine during the first Test defeat at the Gabba.

‘I cannot currently operate at the level I have done in the past,’ said Trott on his return from Australia.

‘My priority now is to take a break from cricket so that I can focus on my recovery.’

Trott by numbers

Backing down: Vaughan stated on Twitter on Friday morning that he was sad for Trott after his recent setback

Nov 21, 2013: The first Test 
in Brisbane begins. Trott scores only 19 in two innings, falling both 
times to Australia left-arm speedster Mitchell Johnson (right).

Nov 25, 2013:
 Quits the Ashes tour. England insist his departure is down to a 
stress-related illness. Trott says: ‘I don’t feel it is right that I’m 
playing knowing that I’m not 100 per cent and I cannot currently operate
 at the level I have done in the past.’

Mar 6, 2014: Trott announces he is ready
 to return to action and targets Warwickshire’s pre-season friendly 
against Gloucestershire as well as an England recall. He also insists he
 was suffering from burnout and not a stress-related illness in 
Australia. Trott says: ‘I was getting headaches and all sorts of things 
and I wasn’t eating properly towards the end, and that’s when the sleep 
started getting disrupted and emotionally that was probably when I was 
worst and it just boiled over.’

Apr 1, 2014: Plays for the first time but scores only four against Gloucestershire before falling to left-arm quick David Payne.
