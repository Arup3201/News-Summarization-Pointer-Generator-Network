Some called it 'creepy' and 'nauseating' but the daddy who posted a video online of him on a date with his three year old daughter has come Down Under to pass on his tips on how to be a good dad.  

The clip featuring Aaron Dickson and his adorable three-year-old daughter Analynne has gone viral and has been viewed more than 8 million times. 

The 27-year-old told Daily Mail Australia he was 'shocked' by the negative reaction the video got and 'felt a bit sorry' for those people.

Mr Dickson and Analynne on their 'date' 

The father-of-two says he was 'emulating' his dad who took his older sister on daddy-daughter dates

The 'date' took place on the back porch of the families' house 

The video, shot in June, shows Mr Dickson, who is a  worship leader and pastor, getting ready for the date. 

It shows Analynne opening their front door with a big smile on her face when she sees her dad.

Analynne is clearly very pleased to see her beloved dad in the video 

They then have lunch and a waiter comes along to fill up Analynne's sippy cup with water and they enjoy a meal of strawberries and peanut butter sandwiches.

Mr Dickson said: 'I think people have a problem with the word 'date'. 

'All it means is time with my child, it is unfortunate that people viewed it that way. 

Mr Dickson gives Analynne roses and also takes her to the park in the video 

Mr Dickson's said he  'felt a bit sorry' for those people who didn't like the clip

Mr Dickson has come to Australia to mark Father's Day and share his ideas about what dads should do with their children

'My dad would take my older sister on daddy daughter dates and I was just emulating what I had seen growing up, it was just natural. 

'I feel a bit sorry for the people who have viewed it negatively; they may have not had a good relation shop with mothers and fathers,

'We just have a strong family bond.'

1. Slow down and pay attention to the details around you.  Little kids are living in a dream world, have big imaginations and want to be cherished.

2. We need to take time off from our devices and TV.

2. Pursue our kids interests and make sure they know they are worth our time.

3. Be creative, it doesn't take money to spend time with our kids.

4. Tailor your time to the individual child - if they like climbing trees take them to the park etc

5.Transform areas of your home into exciting places like a palace or a boat.  Little kids have vivid imaginations and dream big. 

Mr Dickson said: 'I had no idea it would go so mad.

'We thought maybe 300 people might see it, we had three followers on our YouTube channel and and it wasn't until other companies picked it up did it start going mad. 

'It is surreal; it just keeps going and going.' 

The Dads4Kids Fatherhood Foundation saw the video and flew Mr Dickson out to Australia to help promote Father's Day this weekend. 

He added: 'We will be making more of these videos.

'We have a YouTube channel and we have been filming Analynne. 

'She loves to sing and even though she is only three, she is really good.

'She loves the camera.'
