Upbeat: UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the press today while visiting South Shields to campaign with local candidate Richard Elvin

Tory voters tempted to switch to the UK Independence Party in Thursday’s local elections are being warned they risk letting in Labour.

The Conservatives say a surge in support for Nigel Farage’s Eurosceptic party will merely help the pro-EU Ed Miliband.

The warning came as a new poll showed one in five over-50s could vote UKIP at the next general election.

The counter the threat, Tories hope to quell the turmoil in their own ranks by stressing a ‘Vote Farage, get Miliband’ message to counter the growing support for UKIP, who are likely to win more votes than the Liberal Democrats.

The move follows Ken Clarke’s scathing attack on UKIP as a party of ‘clowns’ supported by racists and ‘indignant, angry people’. Senior Tory figures expressed dismay yesterday at the veteran Cabinet minister’s unscripted remarks.

They warned that attacking UKIP in such intemperate terms and insulting voters tempted to back them is likely to prove counterproductive.

Tory strategists claim to be encouraged that voters fed up with the Government are not turning to Labour and are instead expressing a protest vote through a Right-wing alternative.

They believe many can be persuaded to return to the fold at the General Election, when the choice will be between a government led by David Cameron committed to an EU referendum, lower welfare spending and reform of human rights laws or one led by Ed Miliband proposing none of those.

A new poll suggested almost a fifth of over-50s could back UKIP at the next general election, making it the second most popular party with older voters.

UKIP's election operation descended into further chaos today over whether or not an MP's father is standing for the party in Thursday's elections.

At 2.30pm UKIP leader Nigel Farage announced that Sushil Patel, father of Priti Patel, was running on a UKIP ticket.

Just after 4pm it was reported that Mr Patel was standing down as a UKIP candidate.

But shortly before 5pm UKIP insisted he was still on board, claiming he remains the candidate for the Bushey South Division in the Hertfordshire County Council elections.

The party added that he is 'currently convalescing from a recent serious operation and is unable to conduct any further interviews'.

Mr. Patel said: 'I am proud of being a UKIP candidate and very proud of the achievements of my daughter who represents the people of Witham in an exemplarily fashion. 

'My views are my own and I am astonished that there has been quite so much interest in my candidacy.'

The Conservatives topped the national poll of over-50s by Populus for Saga with 25 per cent, with UKIP second on 18 per cent.

Its support is also lower among richer voters, unlike the Conservatives, the survey revealed.

UKIP was most popular in the South East and South West of England, with 21% and 20% of those questioned saying they would give it their vote.

The Prime Minister signalled a new strategy for dealing with UKIP yesterday when he insisted Thursday’s local elections are chiefly a choice between the ‘blue team and the red team’.

Speaking in Bridgwater, Somerset, Mr Cameron declined to repeat the suggestion that UKIP is a racist party.

He said: ‘It’s a simple and straight choice, at your county council and at the next election, between the blue team who want to keep getting the deficit down, who want to keep reforming immigration and welfare to make it fair, or you have the red team who put the deficit up and who don’t care if our immigration and welfare system works at all.’ 

London Mayor Boris Johnson agreed 
that Tories should not ‘slag them [UKIP] off just for appearing to 
think, in large part, what many Conservatives think’.

‘[Nigel
Farage] is a blooming Conservative, for heaven’s sake; and yet he’s in 
our constituencies, wooing our audiences, nicking our votes, and 
threatening to put our councillors out of office,’ he said.

Tory
MP Chris Kelly said: ‘Yes, UKIP have a problem with some of their 
candidates but Ken Clarke is plain wrong to use the word “clowns”.’ Mr 
Farage insisted yesterday: ‘There is nothing in UKIP that is in any way 
racist at all.’

Mainstream battle: David Cameron, left, warned that voters tempted by UKIP would only succeed in splitting the right wing vote and helping Labour's Ed Miliband, right

He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘We have one million unemployed, wages have been driven down and  I’m afraid to say, a crime wave in London being driven by Romanians.

‘I don’t want to be part of the European Union and I believe proper immigration controls  are in the interests of this country and I want to stop building wind turbines over the prettiest parts of Britain.’

The Tories are engaged in a bitter war of words with UKIP ahead of Thursday’s local elections. Here, Home Affairs Editor James Slack examines the parties’ policies:

EUROPEUKIP: Withdraw from the EU, its treaties and obligations. The party estimates a saving to the UK of £6.4billion in net contributions. UKIP quotes TaxPayers’ Alliance research that the overall cost of our EU membership to the wider economy is £120billion a year.Tories: Renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the EU then give people the ‘simple choice’ between staying in under those new terms or leaving. Referendum to take place no later than 2017.

TAXUKIP: Introduce a flat rate tax at a suggested rate of 25 per cent. Make the first £13,000 of income tax-free, transferable between couples. Combined policy would cost £20billion a year. Also, scrap national insurance contributions for employers (£50billion) and abolish inheritance tax (£3.3billion).Tories: Personal tax allowance will rise to £10,000 in 2014, taking three million people out of the tax net. Top rate of income tax cut from 50p to 45p. Basic rate of income tax is 20p. Election promise to increase inheritance tax threshold to £1million has been shelved. Level at which inheritance tax becomes payable frozen at £325,000 until at least 2019 to fund reform of the social care system.

DEFENCEUKIP: Increase defence spending by 40 per cent (£16billion) a year plus an additional £4billion a year on military equipment. Cash would go on expanding the Army to 125,000 personnel, doubling the Territorial Army and restoring the Royal Navy to its 2001 strength, with three new aircraft carriers.Tories: Spending to be cut by £4.7billion by 2015. Axing of 30,000 troops plus aircraft carriers, fast jets, spy planes and armoured vehicles. Battle taking place within government to protect the military from further cuts in this summer’s spending review.

On the election trail: Nigel Farage appeared on Daybreak to defend his policies

EDUCATIONUKIP: New grammar schools would be set up, with proper discipline restored. Parents offered school vouchers, equivalent to average cost of state schooling, which could follow the child into private education sector.Tories: Dropped commitment to build more grammars and retained the absolute ban on the introduction of any further selection in state sector. Michael Gove is instead creating more academies and free schools – free from state control. Rigorous programme to restore standards and discipline in classroom.

HUMAN RIGHTSUKIP: Repeal 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from European Convention on Human Rights. In future, British courts will not be allowed to rely on any international treaty or convention that overrides or sets aside a statute of the UK Parliament.Tories: Attempts to replace the HRA with British Bill of Rights thwarted by the Lib Dems. Will be revived only if Tories win next election outright. Recently suggested temporarily withdrawing from ECHR to allow deportation of Abu Qatada. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to leave altogether.

IMMIGRATIONUKIP:  Immediate five-year freeze on immigration for permanent settlement. Fix a future target for net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in the UK, and those leaving – of 50,000 a year.Tories: Concerted crackdown on student visas, family settlement and a cap on non-EU workers. Net migration reduced from 250,000 to 163,000. Target is to cut this still further to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the next election.

LAW AND ORDERUKIP: Double the number of prison places, which currently stands at around 88,000. UKIP claims the cost will be around  £2billion. Withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant. Introduce boot camps for young offenders. Abolish the Crown  Prosecution Service, returning to local police prosecutions.Tories: Feasibility study underway to build the country’s biggest-ever prison, holding 2,000 inmates. Will provide extra prison places when money allows. Discussions taking place with Lib Dems over how many of 100-plus EU crime and justice measures the UK should join.

OVERALL SPENDINGUKIP: The Tories say there is a £120billion financial black hole in UKIP’s economic plans. The chief criticism of the party is that it has produced a wish list which it has no means of paying for.Tories: Reduced the budget deficit they inherited from Labour by a quarter. It currently stands at £121billion – with a commitment to balance the books early in the next Parliament.
