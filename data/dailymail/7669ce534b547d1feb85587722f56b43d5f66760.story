Recognised: Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to stop a US strike on Syria were highlighted as part of the nomination

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.

The former KGB agent has been recommended by an activist group because he 'actively promotes settlement of all conflicts arising on the planet'.

His attempts to prevent a US air strike on Syria after suspected chemical weapons attacks on civilians was also given as a reason behind the recognition.

Despite being the main supplier of weapons to Bashar Al-Assad's regime, fellow politicans have rushed to his defense, with one claiming he is 'more worthy' than Barack Obama.

Activist group The International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of Peoples of the World put his name forward but made no mention of the violent campaigns he waged against the separatists in Chechnya or the war in Georgia.

The letter of recommedationn read: 'Being the leader of one of the leading nations of the world, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin makes efforts to maintain peace and tranquillity not only on the territory of his own country but also actively promotes settlement of all conflicts arising on the planet' The New York Times reported.

Russian singer and MP Iosif Kobzon, backed the nomination comparing his actions to that of the US President, who won the same prize in 2009.

He told Interfax news agency: 'Barack Obama is the man who has initiated and approved the United States' aggressive actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

'Now he is preparing for an invasion into Syria. He bears this title nevertheless.

'Our president, who tries to stop the bloodshed and who tries to help the conflict situation with political dialogue, is more worthy of this high title.'

Prize: Putin has been put up for the award, despite being the main supplier of weapons to Bashar Al-Assad's regime and his responsibility for violent campaigns in Georgia and Chechnya

The prize is awarded to 'the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses'.

Previous winners of the prize have included Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa and Desmond Tutu.

The winner of this year’s prize 
will be announced on October 11 and the deadline for the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize 
nominations is in February.
