Referee Lee Mason clearly does not rate Seamus Coleman. The Everton right back was six yards from goal with just Costel Pantilimon to beat when a sliding Connor Wickham clumsily sent him toppling to the turf.

Simple - penalty, red card. The former, yes. The latter, no. For somehow, Mason kept his cards in his pocket. The whistler's only explanation can be that he did not deem Coleman's chance a goalscoring opportunity. Coleman, do not forget, is a defender who has netted three times already this season – he would have scored.

As it was, Leighton Baines equalised from the spot – just – when his scuffed 76th-minute effort squirmed under Pantilimon to cancel out Seb Larsson's free-kick.

Earlier, in the first half, Sunderland's Jordi Gomez escaped red when Mason, having booked the midfielder for the challenge which forced Gareth Barry off with suspected ankle-ligament damage, failed to show a second yellow for a blatant dive after the Spaniard flung himself over Phil Jagielka's leg.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez certainly felt aggrieved with Mason. 

'We did not have any luck with the big calls,' he said. 'It (Wickham foul) was a penalty and a clear-cut opportunity to score – it was a red card.

'At that time we had momentum and it could have been very different. I was surprised he was not sent off. Once you give a penalty away it is a red card. That was a major moment.'

Martinez – who twice signed Gomez for Swansea and Wigan – also thought his former player should have been dismissed.

'I don't want to see players sent off but those are the rules,' he said. 'Jordi had a yellow card and he got caught simulating. The referee saw it and went to blow the whistle but decided against it. The two big calls did not go our way.'

Gus Poyet, meanwhile, felt that Mason should have shown more conviction.

'Maybe the referee thought it was close,' he said. 'Sometimes, when a referee doesn't know if it's that close, they go 50-50 – give the penalty but don't send off the player. Me, I like it to be black or white. Penalty, red card.

'But it was tough for the ref. Too many little things in isolation made him the most important person on the pitch. The best referees in the world are the ones nobody remembers. We shouldn't be talking about him.'

As it was, Sunderland finished the game with 11 men and could have made it back-to-back victories when James McCarthy hacked Wes Brown's header from the goal-line in stoppage-time.

That they could have nicked three points owed much to Pantilimon, as well as Mason.

The former Manchester City custodian made his first league start during Monday's 3-1 win at Crystal Palace – where he was only beaten by Brown's own goal – and again he impressed.

Early in the second half he twice denied a disappointing Romelu Lukaku, first smothering at the Belgian's feet when he wanted one too many touches in the area and then brushing his top-corner-bound blast onto the angle of the goal.

Those saves allowed the hosts to take an unlikely lead when Larsson – accepting Tim Howard's invitation to locate the bottom corner from 25 yards – duly swept home a delightful free-kick.

Then, the drama unfolded. Wickham escaped red, Baines levelled and McCarthy preserved the point with his last-gasp clearance. 

Martinez, whose side climbed to 10th, reflected: 'We controlled the game with ease for long spells. We did not use that control to produce clear-cut opportunities.

'I was extremely pleased with the reaction and the character. We did not panic.

'We have shown we have the ingredients of a winning team and that pleases me greatly. I don't think the table reflects the potential we have.'

Sunderland – beaten 8-0 at Southampton last month – have recovered to scramble from the foot of the table and up to 12th.

And Poyet added: 'The idea was to stop the negativity and all the bad things we were doing on the pitch with a few good results.

'I am a lot happier than where we were one week ago.'

Poyet – who confirmed left back Patrick van Aanholt needs shoulder surgery and will be out until 2015 – will now use the international break to nurse several of his walking wounded back to fitness ahead of their trip to Leicester. He is lucky, however, that Gomez and Wickham are not suspended.
