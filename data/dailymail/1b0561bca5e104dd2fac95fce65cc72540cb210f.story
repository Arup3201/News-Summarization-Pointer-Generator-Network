Two workmen last night thanked ‘divine intervention’ for their astonishing escape from death as a helicopter crashed into their crane and turned into a fireball.

The pair should have been in the cabin when disaster struck, sending burning debris cascading 700ft on to the rush-hour streets of London below.

Instead, Richard Moule and his colleague Nicki Biagioni were late for work – both had overslept for the first time in years – and missed death by minutes.

The crash, which happened at 8am yesterday in fog, claimed two lives, including that of the helicopter pilot, and left 12 injured. But police said it was ‘a miracle’ that the toll was not higher after the helicopter sliced through the crane ‘as if it was a piece of paper’, scattering wreckage over the streets of Vauxhall, South London.

Father-of-two Mr Moule, 31, told the Daily Mail: ‘My colleague and I were both supposed to be there at 7am but we were both late.

‘It was the first time I’ve been late since starting this job three years ago. I just woke up late. Call it divine intervention if you like.

‘I went in on my motorcycle and got there about 7.45am. I was in the basement ready to go up when it happened.

‘I didn’t hear an explosion. The first I knew was when an alarm went off and people were being evacuated.

‘The first thing I did was call my wife Stephanie and tell her, “You’ll be hearing about this but I’m OK”. She gave me a big hug when I got back home.’

Mr Biagioni’s wife Leanna said that her husband, a father of three, had also overslept. 

She said: ‘He overslept this morning, something he never does and was late for work. He was not up the crane when it hit.

‘I thank his guardian angel.’ Mr 
Biagioni, 30, who is the principal crane operator, was over an hour late
 for work. Friends said he was normally woken by his three children – 
sons Rocco, six, four-year-old Dino, and Luca, two – but yesterday they 
had slept in.

He was just arriving at the site on his motorbike and driving down a ramp to park in front of the crane as the helicopter hit.

Mr Biagioni was only late for his shift because his children were not as noisy as usual in the morning. He said: ‘I was very lucky - it's unbelievable. I am still in shock. If it was not for my boys not waking me up, that would have been it.

‘Normally I would have been up there in the crane but I was running late. Normally I would be have been up there, but instead I just pulled into the site as it all happened. 

He told BBC Essex: ‘Helicopters fly past lower than the crane all the time. You rely on the fact that it is a very safe route for the helicopters and they are meant to stick over the river. The thought of it had been at the back of my mind but it has never been something that I thought would happen.’

Witnesses
 described hearing a loud bang and seeing a flash of light as the 
helicopter collided with the high-rise crane on top of Britain’s tallest
 residential skyscraper, the St George Tower.

Pete
 Barnes, who has piloted helicopters for movies such as the James Bond 
film Die Another Day, was alone in the aircraft amid thick cloud when it
 clipped the structure.

Mr Barnes's brother said it would have been the pilot's 'instinct' to take any steps necessary to minimalise casualties.

'It's a matter of instinct, it's what
 pilots do,' said Chris Barnes, 55. 'Our condolences go out to the 
family of the other man who was killed, that's the last thing that my 
brother would have wanted to happen.'

Paying tribute to his brother, he 
added: 'He was outgoing, very personable. A good-looking guy with an 
irrepressible smile. When he walked into a room you knew he was there, 
he lit up a room. He was a good guy.'

The destruction happened near one of London's busiest transport hubs. Several key roads were closed off, causing commuter chaos, as the emergency services battled fires

The pilot lived with his partner Rebecca Dixon and their two children, eight-year-old Freddie and Alexandra, 12.

She told the Evening Standard: 'Obviously he would have been frantic and the lives of others would have been at the forefront of his mind.'It sums up the man. I find it very comforting and so do the children.'

The AgustaWestland 109 Power hurtled 
to the ground and exploded into flames yards from Vauxhall Station, 
claiming the lives of Mr Barnes and another person on the ground, who 
was named last night as 39-year-old Matthew Wood from Sutton, South 
London.

London Mayor Boris 
Johnson said there could easily have been many more fatalities, given 
the close proximity of the crash scene to one of the capital’s busiest 
transport hubs, Vauxhall Station, a major supermarket and the 
headquarters of MI6.

‘It could have been much worse,’ he said.

Commander Neil Basu, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ‘It was something of a miracle that this was not many, many times worse.’

Tidying up: A specialist police team works today in the aftermath of the helicopter crash in central London

Dramatic video footage and photos of the crash, described by terrified witnesses as being like a 'disaster movie', were uploaded onto the internet, showing images of blazes and chaos

The streets were flooded with emergency services trying to help the injured and put out the flames, as police officers were in disbelief that more people had not been hurt in the collision

Dramatic video footage and photos of the crash, described by terrified witnesses as being like a ‘mini 9/11’ and a ‘disaster movie’, were uploaded onto the internet within minutes, revealing chaotic scenes, burning wreckage and buildings and cars damaged by flames.

Several key roads were closed off, causing commuter chaos, as the emergency services battled fires. Initial fears of a possible terrorist attack were quickly discounted.

Yesterday accident investigators were probing claims by witnesses that a light on top of the crane may not have working or clearly visible. It also emerged that pilots had been warned of the existence of the crane by the aviation authorities.

Last night at his home in Harlow, Essex, Mr Moule’s two young children were repeatedly telling him: ‘I love you, I love you.’

Mr Moule said that he had no idea what he was supposed to do about reporting for work today.

‘I’m just waiting for them to ring me and let me know,’ he said. ‘They’re more concerned about what happened.’

His sister Charlotte, 22, wrote on Twitter: ‘Maybe there is a God up there! That was my brother’s crane and he was late for work today!’

A friend of Mr Biagioni, who lives in Loughton, Essex, said that he was ‘devastated’ for the families of those who died.

He said: ‘He’s got three little kids. I spoke to him earlier on, he’s devastated about what was happened, but is obviously so relieved that he survived.

‘It’s a miracle that he not only lived, but was not hurt.’

Mr Biagioni has been told not to go in to work today. He may now lose his job on the site because the crane is inoperable.
