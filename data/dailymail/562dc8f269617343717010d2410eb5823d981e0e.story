It was what you might call drinking in the Stamford Bridge last chance saloon. 

Mohamed Salah, in all likelihood on his way out of Chelsea, was given one final chance to persuade Jose Mourinho to let him stay.

The fact it was an FA Cup tie against League One opposition in Bradford City, sandwiched between two much more significant and high-profile League Cup games with Liverpool, said everything about the Egyptian’s Chelsea career since he arrived 12 months ago.

He was only on the teamsheet because Mourinho needed to rest his key personnel for Tuesday night’s all-important second leg with the Reds. Plain and simple. In normal circumstances, he probably wouldn’t have made the squad, such are the talents at the manager’s disposal.

The relentless pace of fighting for silverware on four fronts, the inescapable need to rotate the players to avoid injury and fatigue seems to be the only way the £11m Salah can get a game.

He has played a mere 268 minutes of first-team football this season, spread over seven appearances across all competitions. It certainly hasn’t worked out the way he planned when he arrived from Basle with great fanfare last January. Including this one, Salah has featured in just 18 games for the club.

His fate seems sealed. During the remaining days of the transfer window, Salah will head most likely to Roma on loan until the end of the campaign. A longer lasting decision will then be made.

But he was at least granted one last opportunity to show Mourinho - and the Chelsea fans - what they’d be missing. It was certainly more than Andre Schurrle who, like at Liverpool on Tuesday, didn’t make the matchday squad.

He too is heading for the exit door. While Mourinho was insistent in his pre-match comments that it would take a ‘phenomenal offer’ to spirit him away - Wolfsburg are believed to be front-runners - the reality is that Schurrle, just seven months after helping Germany to the World Cup, is out of favour.

Mourinho’s follow-up comment that Schurrle needs to start out-performing Eden Hazard and Willian to regain his place sounded ominous indeed.

Anyway, back to Salah who, with garish red boots and long sleeves on a nippy January afternoon, set out to prove he still has something to give.

The initial signs weren’t promising. He was crowded out by Andy Halliday and Rory McArdle as he tried to make headway down the left and was quickly swapped with Loic Remy to take position on the right.

Chelsea led on 15 minutes, Gary Cahill in the right place to deftly flick home an Oscar corner. The magnificent 6,000 travelling Bradford fans were silenced - at least temporarily.

On 25 minutes, Salah’s first involvement of note, though it wasn’t particularly positive. Both he and Remy lunged to try and reach Didier Drogba’s cleverly threaded through ball.

Remy swung his right leg, Salah his left. They clashed, the ball went to the goalkeeper. Remy shot his team-mate a glance of a thousand knives.

Shortly afterwards, he received the ball wide right from a reluctant Remy, played it in to Ramires and then anticipated the return. It didn’t materialise.

But his next contribution, along similar lines, was good. Ramires emerged from midfield, slotted the ball to Salah and, after a second’s delay, he played the perfect return for the Brazilian to roll the ball in off the post for 2-0.

That was the timing and presence of mind Salah was bought for and has so seldom been able to display.

Jon Stead halved the deficit shortly before the break to ignite the contest again but to judge by Salah’s start to the second period, it was long settled.

Two minutes in and he was showboating, producing a flurry of step-overs, rolling the ball left and right as Andrew Davies’ eyes flickered. It was nice to watch but totally out of context and there were even a few restless jeers from the crowd before Salah passed to Remy.

There was one glimpse of the Salah Chelsea bought last year, a purposeful driving run through the middle. His pace carried him past three Bradford players and it led to a chance for Oscar. That was more like it.

And five minutes later, he cut inside well onto his left foot and curled in a shot that went a couple of inches wide of the post. He was beginning to be genuinely influential.

Then, with the game still delicately-poised at 2-1, it was suddenly all over. The No 17 went up on the board and Salah was replaced by Willian, whom Mourinho hoped would supply the class for a decisive third goal.

There was a smattering of applause for the Egyptian, a few stood in appreciation. Salah, meanwhile, wore the regretful expression of somebody painfully aware all good things must come to an end.
