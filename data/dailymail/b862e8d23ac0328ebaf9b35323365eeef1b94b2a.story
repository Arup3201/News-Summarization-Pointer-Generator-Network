A young hippopotamus who was stuck in a swimming pool at a South African game reserve died just after a rescue operation began.

His body was today winched out of the deep pool at Monate Conservation Lodge, north of Johannesburg, using a crane.

The hippo, named Solly, plunged into the water on Tuesday after being chased away by his herd at the reserve and quickly became firmly lodged in the big tub, which has no steps and is eight feet deep.

The pool was big enough for the four-year-old hippo to swim around it but lodge manager Ruby Ferreira admitted yesterday that there was no way he could climb out.

MuIsabel Wentzel of South Africa's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said a  game capture team would undertake the operation and a vet was to be present.

Most of the water was drained from around the unhappy creature to make the extraction easier, and staff planned to sedate him before he was lifted out.

Wildlife rescue expert Simon Prinsloo poured water on Solly to keep him hydrated, but the poor hippo died just as the vet arrived.

South Africa's Eyewitness News claimed the vet sent to sedate the animal might have been able to save him but arrived nearly four hours late.

His one-ton body was winched out upside-down today with a rescuer standing on top.

Ms Wentzel said the four-year-old hippo's mother had given birth recently, prompting dominant males to force the creature away from the herd and its mother.

Hide-out: The bullied hippo would have had to be moved to another animal sanctuary as he could not have returned to the herd that rejected him

He had been noticeably relaxed with no other male hippos fighting for dominance, although the water in the pool had become unclean with his faeces.

The hippo was to be moved to another animal sanctuary as he could not have returned to the herd that rejected him.

There are two species of hippos, both of which are found in Africa. The large hippo, found in East Africa, is a highly social yet aggressive animal.

Social groups may consist of up to 15 individuals in which a hierarchical society is formed with the older stronger adults ruling the herd.

The pygmy hippo, found in West Africa, is a much shyer and smaller animal, weighing around 440 to 605 pounds. 

Unlike the large hippo, its habitat is much more restricted to forest areas and is considered endangered.
