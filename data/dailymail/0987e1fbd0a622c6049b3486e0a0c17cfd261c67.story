This Christmas will likely be her last.

So, Addie Fausett's family are gathering festive cards to make the holiday even more special for her.

The six-year-old, who weighs just 23 pounds, suffers from an undiagnosed condition which has led to a range of problems, including cerebral atrophy, the deterioration of  her brain function.

On a daily basis, she struggles to talk, move and play with her brother and sisters, Shayley and Audre. Last month, her family was given the devastating prognosis that she has a year left to live.

So, to make her final Christmas the best one ever, the youngster's mother, Tami Fausett, father and grandparents decided to start collecting a 'lifetime of cards' from friends and strangers.

Now, Addie has started counting the hordes of cards that are pouring in from well-wishers across the country and hanging them on doors around her home in Fountain Green in Sanpete County, Utah.

'She doesn't get to play with kids, so we thought if everyone would send her a card, we could tell all her friends it would make her Christmas a little bit better,' Ms Fausett told KSL.com. 

'[We’re] hoping to get a lot so we can cover all the walls with them, for Addie.'

'She likes to laugh and have a good time and hear stories, but lately she has had a lot of days she will just cry all day long,'  said Ms Fausett.

'Cerebral atrophy is just a symptom of what is wrong, but she is still undiagnosed. They told us she probably won't last much longer and they told us [she has] roughly a year.' 

Addie now weighs just 23 pounds - less than half the average weight of a six-year-old child.  

If you wish to send Addie and her siblings a card, you can mail it to: Box 162, Fountain Green, Utah, 84632.
