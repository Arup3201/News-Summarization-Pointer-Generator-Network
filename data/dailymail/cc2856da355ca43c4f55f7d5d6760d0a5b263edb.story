The onetime Republican vice presidential candidate who quit her job as Alaska's governor wrote on Tuesday that President Barack Obama should be forced out of his White House gig.

'Enough is enough of the years of abuse 
from this president,' she wrote. 'His unsecured border crisis is the last straw that 
makes the battered wife say, "no mas".'

'The many impeachable offenses of Barack Obama can no longer be ignored. If after all this he’s not impeachable, then no one is.'

Her demand rocketed around the political world, attracting thousands of tweets and keeping the tea party darling in the public eye – which may be what she wants.

Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has riled up the tea party troops by demanding the impeachment of President Barack Obama

Not fazed: Obama met with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen in the Oval Office on Tuesday, and the White House hasn't commented on Palin's red-meat essay

Mocking Obama is nothing new for Palin – in March she compared the bear-wrestling Russian president Vladimir Putin to Obama 'who wears mom jeans' – but she is the highest-profile Republican yet to call for his ouster.

Palin hosts a Sportsman Channel reality TV show called 'Amazing America,' a program that was renewed on Monday for a second season.

She also planted a seed in Hollywood last week, throwing her hat into the ring as a potential future hire to replace one of the fired co-hosts on the talk show 'The View.'

Rosie O'Donnell, the outspoken liberal former comedian, was signed on Tuesday to take one slot alongside actress Whoopi Goldberg, according to TMZ. But the show's producers are reportedly still looking to add a Hispanic woman and a conservative.

Palin told The Hollywood Reporter on Monday that the show would benefit from her 'real-life groundedness [sic], candor and commonsense.'

'I hear everyone recently got canned from The View,' she said. '[M]aybe a show like that needs a punch of reality and a voice of reason from America's heartland to knock some humble sense into their scripts.'

But a day later it's Palin's verbal punch in the nose to the commander-in-chief that has Washington, D.C. tongues wagging.

'Without borders, there is no nation. Obama knows this,' Palin wrote in her essay at Breitbart.com.

'Opening our borders to a flood of illegal immigrants is deliberate. This is his fundamental transformation of America. It’s the only promise he has kept.'

Her jab came as national attention is focused on a flood of illegal immigrant children who have swarmed across America's southern border.

Republicans claim Obama's own 2012 policy shift, delaying for years the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, encouraged tens of thousands of underage children to make the trip – without adults – from Central America.

Tea party anger: Protesters outside a U.S. Border Patrol station in Murrieta, California clashed with federal agents on Independence Day as the agency was foiled in an attempt to bus in and process illegal immigrants who have flooded the U.S. -Mexico border

Preaching to the choir: Conservatives who identify with the tea party and usually rally around Palin have already decided to blame President Obama for the border crisis

Obama, according to Palin, has 'given false hope and taxpayer’s change to millions of foreign nationals who want to sneak into our country illegally.'

'Because of Obama’s purposeful dereliction of duty an untold number of illegal immigrants will kick off their shoes and come on in, competing against Americans for our jobs and limited public services.'

'We’re the ones getting screwed,' Palin claimed, 'as we’re forced to follow all our government’s rules while others are not required to do so.'

Promos for Palin's 'Amazing America' show are aggressive and no-holds-barred, like her rhetorical style, and both are seemingly calculated to generate controversy

Impeachment proceedings in Congress, she wrote, can't wait because 'irreparable harm can be done in this lame-duck term as he continues to make up his own laws as he goes along.'

A host of Republican lawmakers have said in the past that impeachment should be an option, but few have expended the political capital required to demand it publicly.

Senators James Inhofe and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Tim Scott of South Carolina have jumped aboard the impeachment train.

So have Reps. Jason Chaffetz  of Utah, Blake Farenthold and Michael Burgess of Texas, Kerry Bentivolio Tim Scott of South Carolina – who is now a senator – and (R-Mich.), and Tim Scott of Michigan and then-Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Scott is now i the U.S. Senate.

Allen West of Florida and Tom Tancredo of Colorado both gave the idea their approval before leaving Congress. The South Dakota Republican Party passed a resolution this weekend calling for impeachment as well.

A host of scandals have plagued the president, mostly in his second term, including claims that his IRS targeted conservative groups for political punishment, that his NSA spied on millions of Americans without legal authority, and that his DOJ tapped journalists' phones and copied their emails.

The 'Obamacare' medical insurance overhaul program has become more unpopular with each month.

And the president has been dogged by Republicans' claims that his 2011 Iraq troop withdrawal – known in military circles as the 'Obama bug-out' – led to the current crisis there, where heavily armed Islamists have established what they call the world's first jihadi state.
