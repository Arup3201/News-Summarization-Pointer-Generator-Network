An adulterer who has had over 100 affairs with married men has claimed she has never wrecked a marriage.

Karen Marley, a 48-year-old divorcee from Richmond, N.Yorks, has been finding men on extra-marital dating sites since 2006.

In an interview on This Morning today, the antiques dealer also stated that when she finally decides to settle down in a monogamous relationship, her man won't cheat because, 'I'd probably be able to keep him happy.'

Karen Marley, a 48-year-old divorcee, appeared on ITV's This Morning today and claimed that despite her 100 extra-marital relationships, she had never wrecked a marriage

Appearing on the ITV show alongside hosts Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley, and agony aunt Denise Robertson, the antiques dealer said. 'Never in all of the years doing this have I wrecked a marriage.

'I am absolutely sure I’ve never personally split up a marriage.'

She continued: 'I would never be like the woman in Fatal Attraction and make anyone leave his wife.

'There are so many men looking for an affair because it suits them. If he chooses to leave that is his choice. 

'If anyone has ever suggested it, they’ve been dropped straight away.' 

Talking of her first foray into the world of secret extra-marital trysts, she said: 'When I first signed up to dating sites, I soon figured most of the men were married.

'They weren’t available after five o'clock and couldn't see me during weekends. 

'They were keen during working hours and would occasionally slip away whilst washing the car on a Sunday - but it was fairly obvious. 

'Then I would get these very random text messages at times that you knew the wife wasn't around.'

That's when Ms Marley decided to sign up to an extra-marital dating site, something recent statistics show over a million fellow Brits have done. 

She said: 'It was nice to know where the boundaries were.'

She continued: 'I’m single and I love being single. I love my single life - I get to see my friends – and [when I joined the site] I didn’t particularly want a relationship with someone who would monopolise my time.'

So she opted instead for married men, who would 'pop up every fortnight' to see her before going back to their wives and family.

Karen also attempted to justify her behaviour by claiming that not all of her relationships with married men were sexual. 

She said: 'They're not all sexual. With a lot of guys it's just friendships. 

'Most guys have no one to talk to – they don’t talk to friends about emotional problems.'

Since 2006, Ms Marley has dated over 100 married men and had 'fully blown affairs' with 20 of them.

Although she claims not to have broken up any marriages, Karen admits that some of the affairs have left her feeling guilty. 

She said: 'There is some sense of guilt because women should know. I feel incredibly sorry for the wives who genuinely don’t know.

'But I also think that if a guy is on a site looking for an affair the they are already on that road. 

'If they are prepared to go looking for someone to have an affair with, they'll have an affair.'

Talking of her first foray into the world of secret extra-marital trysts, Karen said: 'When I first signed up to dating sites I soon figured most of the men were married'

Karen has been dating married men for so long now that she has a set of guidelines that she initiates for every new relationship so the man's wife doesn't find out. 

She revealed: 'We sort out guidelines and rules beforehand - I don’t date anywhere near home as I don’t want to bump into someone with their wife in the supermarket.

'I date far from home so I don’t have to be twitchy.' 

But despite her willingness to get into a relationship with a married man, Karen revealed that she would drop a boyfriend in an instant if she found out they were cheating on her. 

She said: 'The second I knew about it he'd be gone. I would not tolerate an affair.

'I would not settle down with any man I've dated. If they're going to cheat once, they'll cheat twice.'

But she also expressed doubt any man of hers would cheat, saying: 'I'd probably be able to keep him happy.'
