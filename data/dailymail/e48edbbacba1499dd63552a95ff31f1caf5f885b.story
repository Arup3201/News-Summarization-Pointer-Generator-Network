A solar kettle that harnesses energy from the Sun and does not require access to mains electricity has gone on sale.

The kettle, developed by British engineer James Bentham,  boils water by using solar technology, making it ideal for intrepid explorers who need more than a traditional flask to keep them warm and hydrated.

In addition to making a cup of tea, the portable kettle can also be used to sterilise river water and desalinate seawater.

The Solar Kettle, designed by British engineer James Bentham, harnesses the Sun's rays to make a cup of tea possible no matter where you are in the world. It can also be used as a flask to store hot water for long periods

Resembling a telescope, it works by using a thermal vacuum tube to absorb and convert the Sun’s rays into heat.

Two exterior reflectors open out to maximise the amount of solar energy obtained, enabling the water inside to boil without the need for any additional energy supply.

It also comes with an built-in stand so that it can be positioned to face the Sun, along with a thermometer located on the lid, which allows the user to monitor the temperature of the water.

The Solar Kettle’s exterior remains cool to touch, even when the contents are at the boiling point, reducing the risk of burns to the user. It can also be used to store hot water for long periods of time.

The kettle is weighs 1.2 kg (2.6 lb) when empty and only stores half a litre of water at a time. But it could be the difference between life and death as it can sterilise river water and desalinate seawater. The inventor also says it can boil an egg

 Solar Kettle’s exterior remains cool to touch, even when the contents 
are at the boiling point, reducing the risk of burns to the user.

But weighing in at 1.2 kg (2.6 lb) when empty, it is considerably heavier than most flasks.

It can only hold around half a litre of water and takes approximately two hours to boil from cold.

But in survival situations the kettle, which costs £35 from Contemporary Energy,  can be used to sterilise contaminated water and purify it for drinking.

It can also desalinate seawater to make it safe to drink.

And because the Solar Kettle contains a 
vacuum between its layers, it remains cool to the touch.

The vacuum 
should last around 25 years.

Mr Bentham, from Alresford, Hampshire, explained that the kettle can be used to boil water for making hot drinks, cooking
 an egg, and sterilising medical equipment.

He said: 'Whether you're a cyclist, 
canoeist, climber, ambler, angler, hiker or bird watcher, the Solar 
Kettle's ability to boil water using sunlight in remote areas brings 
many benefits.

'You can make a cuppa, have a shave, do the washing up, improve water and medical equipment sanitation and cook lunch.

'It's incredibly versatile. No electricity, no gas, no fuss.'
