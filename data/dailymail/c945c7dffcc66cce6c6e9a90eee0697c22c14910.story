Svetlana Krivsun, 23, is currently under house arrest accused of causing the crash at a Moscow airport

The young female Russian air traffic controller accused of causing the death of French oil boss Christophe de Margerie has has lost her baby due to stress, her lawyer has revealed.

Trainee Svetlana Krivsun, 23, currently under house arrest, faces up to seven years in jail if found guilty of giving the order to Total boss's Falcon business jet to takeoff at a Moscow airport when a snowplough was on the runway.

The plane clipped the vehicle moments after leaving the ground, exploding in a fireball and killing de Margerie and the three crew.

'My client had a miscarriage as a result of the continuous nervous tension,' said her lawyer Sergey Isaev during a court hearing to prolong Krivsun's detention.

He told a judge that she had been pregnant on the day of the air crash but at the time did not know she was expecting a baby.

Her house arrest made it difficult for her to see a doctor when her pregnancy became evident, he claimed.

'Because of the delay in seeking medical help, she lost the baby,' he said, saying she was unable to attend the court hearing.

'Now she needs long-term treatment, including psychological.'

The judge ordered that she remain under house arrest until April 23 pending a trial into the tragedy.

Rookie air traffic controller Krivsun maintains she acted properly during the incident when she was under a supervisor, who is now held in custody also accused of violating safety rules, so causing the fatal crash.

Critics have alleged low-level staff have been accused over the crash while investigators have failed to examine failures by senior staff at Vnukovo Airport, including cost cutting and use of outdated equipment which may have failed to show the snowplough was on the runway as Krivsun gave the go-ahead for takeoff.

She told an earlier hearing from behind the metal bars of a court cage: 'I am a simple trainee controller.

'I am just learning under the guidance of an experienced professional, obeying his commands.'

Snowplough driver Vladimir Martyenko, 60, who was alleged by investigators to have been drunk at the time of the crash, is also held in detention, along with three other staff from Vnukovo Airport.

He faces a custody hearing today.

In a letter to relatives of the dead he begged them to 'forgive me if you can' after his snowplough remained on the runway when other vehicles had departed.

However, he denies being drunk and maintains he was carrying out orders when the crash happened.

Krivsun is a recent a graduate of Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School, the largest in Russia.

At her first court appearance after the October crash she was in tears and hid her face in a hood and scarf. She was led away by armed guards in handcuffs.

Her union protested in the aftermath of the crash about the conditions in which she and other suspects were questioned.

'We are outraged with the horrendous actions of the Investigative Committee of Russia who have detained and took away our colleagues at 2am on 23 October after 48 hours interrogation,' said Sergey Kovalev, president of Russia's Federal Trade Union of Air Traffic Controllers.

'These air traffic controllers had just finished their night shift. They were interrogated without lawyers. They treated them like dangerous criminals, they took them out in handcuffs.

'They were morally and physically depressed. They were without food and sleep for almost three days.

'The trainee air traffic controller needed medical help. An ambulance was called. We think that their detention is groundless, they agreed to cooperate with the investigators.'

De Margerie, 63, was seen as one of Russia's biggest business supporters in the West. He died after attending a meeting with Russian premier Dmitry Medvedev in which he urged Moscow to act to end US and EU sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.
