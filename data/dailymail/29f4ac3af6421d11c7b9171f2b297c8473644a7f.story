Adrian Chiles endured some difficult moments during ITV's improvised coverage of England's game against Honduras in Miami.

After the players were forced off midway through the first half due to an electrical storm, Chiles was forced to improvise to fill over 40 minutes of coverage on national television.

The ITV presenter was struggling with the heat in Miami with sweat patches apparent before kick-off.

During the storm delay, Chiles and ITV pundits Lee Dixon, Ian Wright and Glenn Hoddle relocated to a backstage area, and all four were seen to be dabbing their eye brows and sweating.

Former Bolton striker Kevin Davies tweeted: 'My old boss Mr Hoddle looking hot and bothered in Miami.'

England manager Roy Hodgson joined the ITV contingent for an interview.

Hodgson said: 'It's a first for me. I've never experienced a game being abandoned by this type of stormy weather.

'We were controlling the game and had a couple of very good chances. Neither team going hell for leather - but that's understandable.'

Chiles then interviewed a game official, who he mistook for a stadium manager.

The ITV presenter also asked for the air conditioning to be tuned up because 'we are expiring in here'.

As the game resumed after a delay of over 40 minutes, Chiles signed off his uncomfortable link by saying he was off to find a dry cleaners.
