An 83-year-old Turkish tailor has inadvertently become a worldwide style phenomenon after capturing the attention of a photographer who has shared his eclectic outfits online.

Father of 18, Ali, who has lived in Berlin for 44 years, walks past a cafe in the German capital every morning where Zoe Spawton works.

The 29-year-old was captivated by the octogenarian's sense of style. Every morning, he walked past her in a different dapper outfit including double breasted suits in a variety of colours, matching camouflage jacket and trousers and a leather hooded jacket.

Each time he wore a hat befitting his clothing from a woolly beanie to a baseball cap or trilby.

Australian-born Zoe explained: 'Ali walks past the cafe I work at in Berlin every morning at 9.05am. I’m not sure where he is going, but we always say hello to each other. He always wears such great clothes. I don’t speak much German and he speaks a little bit of English, but I managed to ask if I could take his photo. He gladly accepted.'

Zoe then created the blog What Ali Wore documenting the father's style and their blossoming friendship. She learnt that Ali (she does not give out his surname) is a retired doctor who now works as a tailor - and is on his way to work when he passes her cafe.

He told her he has more than 80 suits and the fashionista in him means he hates Zoe to take a picture of him wearing the same outfit more than once.

'Ali seems to remember if I have already taken a photo of a particular outfit, and doesn’t usually let me do repeats,' she said.

Hat and jacket for every occasion: Zoe has been charting Ali's eclectic style since last summer

Since Zoe started the blog last summer, it has received thousands of hits and worldwide media attention. The blog has been publicised in country's including the U.S, Germany and Ali's native Turkey.

Zoe said she is overwhelmed by the success of the blog - while she's noted Ali has appeared to have upped the ante with his choice of outfits in her most recent pictures.

Fashion conscious: He may be wearing the same hat here but Ali doesn't like to be pictured in the same outfit more than once. Zoe said on the right he was 'working a New York City cop vibe'

She commented on a picture of Ali at the end of March where he wears a smart pin stripe suit with a red tie and trilby hat: 'I feel as though Ali might have had an inkling that there would be a few more people seeing his photo today; this is quite the outfit!'

She added: 'With the help of Google Translate I tried to explain to Ali today that he might be recognised on the u-bahn…he seemed quite pleased.'

Beautiful friendship: After walking past her cafe every morning, Ali and Zoe have now become firm friends after she asked to photograph him for her blog

Aside from the professional recognition the blog has bought her as a photographer, Zoe is delighted by the friendship it has meant she has cultivated with Ali. Despite the generation gap and language barrier, she considers him a firm friend and she even attended a wedding with him this month.

'It feels so simple, just a friendship where we enjoy seeing each other', she told CNN. 'He seems to enjoy having his photographs taken. It must be nice to have it acknowledged that he's a stylish man.'
