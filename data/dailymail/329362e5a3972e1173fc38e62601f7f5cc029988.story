Andy Murray was back on the practice court on Tuesday, intent on making sure there will be no repeat of the mysterious attack of cramping that nearly put him out of the US Open almost before it had begun.

His next opponent is lowly German qualifier Matthias Bachinger, but as Murray drily noted of his physical meltdown in the first round versus Robin Haase: ‘If he watched, I am sure he will be feeling pretty good about the match.’

Murray is supremely fit, a diligent trainer with a highly professional support team and has been in the American summer since early July, so there had to be other reasons for his distress against the Dutchman.

The inquest is likely to focus on the build-up to the match, which was unusual on two counts. Firstly, the women’s match beforehand took only 47 minutes so the players were on court very abruptly, which could have affected his fluid and carb intake beforehand.

Also, the 27-year-old Scot took the Friday before the tournament off and spent his time following Rory McIlroy at the golf in New Jersey, before heading to watch basketball in the evening at Madison Square Garden.

Mark Leather, a master of sports physiology who is head of performance at Bolton Wanderers, pointed out that hydration can catch out even well-prepared athletes.

‘It can be relevant what you have done in the previous two or three days,’ said Leather. ‘Just having clear urine does not mean you are properly hydrated. People might underestimate what a finely tuned athlete someone like Andy Murray is and that fractional changes can make a bigger difference than expected. Air conditioning, like in an indoor stadium, can add to dehydration.’

The other most likely cause of cramping is tension although, after coming through in four sets, Murray said: ‘I didn’t feel particularly nervous. I’ve been a lot more nervous before Slam finals. It was weird.’ 

As Leather pointed out, however, the mind can work in ways beyond scientific understanding: ‘The power of the brain on the body is a grey area. And you could understand Andy being quite tense at some level.

To the best of 'em: Sports physiologist Mark Leather says hydration can catch out even well-prepared athletes

‘There is pressure on him, he has dropped down the rankings, there are a few questions. However tough you are, nobody is immune to those feelings.’

There is no doubt the Haase encounter was an awkward start to what is already a difficult tournament for Murray. It was played on his least favourite court at a Grand Slam, one where he has seen plenty of problems before - including against the same opponent. It was also his first match at a major since his uncharacteristic slump against Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon.

The wider issue is that he has come to New York still searching for a significant win over a top-10 player this year. That is sure to gnaw away at his belief until it is rectified, as it surely will be in time.

The fact Rafael Nadal, his Slam nemesis, is not here may also be adding to the pressure he places on himself. Well before the cramping began, Murray was not playing with much fluency against Haase and he put in five double faults before the first set was done.

His ball toss — believed to be the cause of his much discussed outburst during the Dimitrov match at Wimbledon — appears to be an issue at the moment.

It is much to Murray’s credit he still won. Lesser competitors would have succumbed, but he still has a shot at getting to the stage where he can claim the kind of major scalp that should turn his season around. It was confirmed that Murray, who appeared to be moving freely on the practice court, will play on Thursday giving him three days to ensure the cramping does not re-occur.
