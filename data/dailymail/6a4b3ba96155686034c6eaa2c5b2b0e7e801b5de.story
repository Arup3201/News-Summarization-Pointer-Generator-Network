New parents: Louise Woodward, pictured with husband Anthony Elkes, has given birth to a girl

Former nanny Louise Woodward has given birth to her first child - 16 years after she was jailed in America for killing a baby in her care.

Woodward, now 35, gave birth to a girl last week, close to her due date. 

The law graduate and husband Anthony Elkes, a businessman, have named their daughter Holly.

She was born at the turn of the New Year.

Woodward was convicted of shaking eight-month-old Matthew Eappen to death in his home in Boston in 1997 and was jailed for 15 years.

She was released after just 279 days when she won an appeal to reduce her conviction to involuntary manslaughter.

Woodward, now known as Mrs Elkes, teaches dance classes in a village hall and occasionally bakes celebration cakes for extra cash.

She and Mr Elkes, 34, are said to be ‘thrilled’ by their baby’s new arrival but has so far declined to comment on their happy news.

It is understood that both mother and child remain in hospital in Shrewsbury but were due to be transferred to a maternity unit closer to Woodward’s home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, imminently.

A source said: ‘Mother and baby are both doing well. Louise and Anthony have called the baby Holly. She was born either on New Year’s Eve or maybe New Year’s Day.

‘I’m not sure why they are still in hospital, but Louise had an infection shortly before the birth so the doctors may just be playing it safe because of that.

‘She was a big baby - over nine pounds. I’m sure they are both delighted - I know Louise couldn’t wait to start a family.’ 

A man who answered the door at Woodward’s mother Susan’s home in Barnston, Wirral, smiled when asked about the baby, but also declined to comment further.

Woodward declined to comment about her pregnancy when approached in the autumn, saying she wished to ‘maintain my privacy’.

However she has previously spoken of how she fell in love ‘at first sight’ with her husband Mr Elkes - who runs a truck sales and hire business - at a nightclub in Chester, and said they had been talking about having children within months of getting together in 2006.

Speaking to the Daily Mail the following
 March, she said: ‘We would love to have a family. We both want that. I 
know that it is all very quick, but it just feels right for both of us.

‘Of course, I know that there are some people out there just waiting for me to have a baby so they can say nasty things.

‘That upsets me, but that is not going to stop me leading my life. I am innocent, I have done nothing wrong. I am entitled to enjoy my life, I am not going to apologise for being happy.'

Meanwhile, Matthew’s aunt Mary Wong, 52, said Woodward had a ‘right to have a child’, but suggested the woman take parenting classes and learn to control her temper.

'For the sake of her own child I hope she is a better parent,' she said.

'For the sake of her family I hope her parenting skills have come a long way... I think that she needs to have parenting skills and support for her baby.

'I hope no harm comes to the child.'

Woodward lived in the Cheshire village of Elton when she flew to the US in 1996 on a gap year following her A-levels.

She then landed her dream job as a nanny aged 19 at the Boston home of Debbie and Sunil Eappen. Just 10 weeks later Matthew died of brain injuries.

Prosecutors alleged Matthew had shown classic symptoms of shaken baby syndrome, but the defence team argued the death had been caused by an injury the baby sustained weeks before.

Despite being jailed for 15 years, a judge downgraded the conviction on appeal and the sentence was reduced to the time Louise had spent on remand.

Woodward has always maintained her innocence, and her claims have been backed by various medical experts in recent years.

In 2002, she graduated from South Bank University in London with a law degree and later secured a two-year trainee contract with a solicitor’s firm in Oldham, Greater Manchester.

She left the firm after a year to go into business with a dance teacher she had begun a relationship with after going to his classes.
