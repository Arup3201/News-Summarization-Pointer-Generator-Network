Her dresses sell out within hours of her wearing them; her hairstyle is copied in salons across the country.

But all those seeking to emulate the Duchess of Cambridge’s style no longer have to pore over photographs.

They can simply consult Vogue’s complete guide to Kate.

From the diameter of her curls to the number of teeth she shows when she smiles, nothing has escaped the fashion bible’s scrutiny.

Ahead of her 31st birthday tomorrow, the magazine has analysed outfits the duchess has worn since her marriage to Prince William in April 2011, plus a handful from before the couple’s engagement – 100 in total.

So to be a true copy Kate, you should wear blue, ensure the average drop of your earrings is 33mm – and carry your clutch bag with both hands.

According to the guide, when it comes to her clothes, Kate’s favourite colour appears to be blue, which she has worn on 24 per cent of occasions.

From peacock to Prussian, it is her out and out favourite.

She also favours red (13 per cent) - which she wore for the occasion of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Pageant - followed by white (12 per cent) and, less popularly with the public, grey (11 per cent).

Next on the list is purple (9 per cent), multi coloured or patterned outfits (eight per cent) pink ( seven per cent) and green ( six per cent).

Cream and yellow both languish at the bottom of the league table on five per cent.

By far and away most outfits worn on her last 100 official engagements come from top end High Street store LK Bennett - worn on 28 public engagements.

But designer Alexander McQueen, whose outfits cost several thousand pounds apiece and who the Duchess chose to design her wedding dress, is her next favourite label with 14.

Other designers in Kate’s top five are Jenny Packham (six), who has designed some of her most stunning evening dresses, and Temperley (eight).

Once the high street Queen, Zara languishes at seven (probably because the firm have a huge store just a short hop from her home at Kensington Palace).

But surprisingly Reiss, the label Kate wore to meet US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle at Buckingham Palace, does not even register.

Vogue have even made it their business to scrutinise the length of the Duchess’s sleeves - finding that 6:1 being the most commonly seen arm-to-sleeve-length ratio.

‘All the better to display the royal wrist-bling,’ it says.

The magazine estimates that on her most recent tour of South East Asia and the Pacific, the Duchess took along 61 items of clothing, footwear and accessories worth around £1,427 per outfit (compared to the late Diana, Princess of Wales whose tour outfits costs the modern equivalent of £4,270 a pop).

Kate’s other most talked-about asset is her glorious tumbling tresses and the magazine has even, unbelievably, worked out the average diameter of her curls - 25mm.

The Duchess goes for a glossy ‘Chelsea blow dry’ 73.4 of the time - a perfectly achievable goal if one, like Kate, has a hairdresser on call 24 hours a day.

Just like on her wedding day, she favours a chic half-up half-down do 13.6 per cent of the time, wearing it either naturally loose and curly or in a ponytail 6.5 per cent of occasions.

Her accessories are equally closely monitored.

Apparently the Duchess has perfected the tilt of her hats and fascinators - always to the right at a stylish 50 degree angle - to show off her enviable cheekbones.

The average dimension of her favourite clutch bags is 194mm by 132 mm and she carried them as thus: one handed 31 per cent, left hand over right 15.5 per cent, right hand over left 5.5 per cent, hands together 48 per cent.

Her favoured shoe designer is the upmarket Stuart Weitzman - sported on 13 public engagements out of the last 100 - closely followed by Jimmy Choo (well you would do, wouldn’t you?) at nine official events.

The analysis found Kate favoured the colour blue, having been seen wearing it on 24 per cent of occasions, while green dresses only made it to six per cent

Even her earrings do not escape scrutiny - the average drop measuring exactly 33 mm.

One of her favourites pairs is a glittering sapphire and diamond set once owned by William’s mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, who sported them on the cover of Vogue in July 1994.

Seventeen years later, on her July 2011 official tour to Canada, Kate wore them in public again after having them slightly remodelled.

Creams and yellow languish at the bottom of the table at five per cent, according to the study, which analysed everything including the length of her sleeves

Even her teeth do not escape the eagle eye of the fashionistas.

Apparently the Duchess, who is believed to have had her teeth whitened and straightened by ‘micro-rotation’ - using invisible braces attached to the back of each tooth - shows an average of 8.6 teeth when she smiles.
