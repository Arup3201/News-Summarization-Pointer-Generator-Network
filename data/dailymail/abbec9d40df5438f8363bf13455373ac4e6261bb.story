While most bank robbers might have chosen a balaclava or a more traditional pair of tights to keep their faces hidden during a raid, this thief had other ideas.

Instead he strolled into a branch of Barclays with blue masking tape over his face before demanding money from shocked cashiers.

Staff handed over bags of notes before the criminal jumped into a metallic green Peugeot estate parked in a service road behind the bank.

It's a sticky-tape up: Police are hunting this man who raided a branch of Barclays while wearing blue masking tape around his face as a disguise

Officers say the man escaped with a quantity of bank notes before jumping into a metallic green Peugeot estate car parked at the back of the building

However, a pouch of red dye is then believed to have exploded inside the car, covering the interior and the crook, showing that forward planning is perhaps not his strongest suit.

The raid took place at Barclays Bank in Wallisdown in Poole, Dorset, at around 10am on Thursday.

Detective Sergeant Dave Colomb, of Dorset Police, said: 'Following enquiries I am now able to release CCTV images of the suspect.

'Even though his faced is disguised it is hoped that someone may recognise him by his clothing and stature.

'It is believed that a security pack containing red dye discharged over the suspect shortly after the robbery. If anyone has seen this man with red dye on his clothing they are urged to contact the police urgently.

'All calls are treated with the strictest confidence.'

The man is described as white, approximately 5ft 10in tall, wearing a light blue Kappa tracksuit top, black Nike tracksuit bottoms and white Nike Air trainers.

He was also wearing a baseball cap, which had a fawn coloured peak and white writing on it.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police on 101.
