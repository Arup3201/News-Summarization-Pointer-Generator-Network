Britain's population is growing at more than twice the European average.

The number living in the UK soared by 400,000 last year – almost a third of the increase across all 27 EU countries.

The rise is underpinned by high levels of migration and a baby boom itself brought about mainly by immigrants.

Overcrowded? Britain will have the highest population in Europe within 40 years, according to projections made by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency

The figures from Eurostat, the statistical arm of the EU, are further evidence that England is becoming the most crowded country in Europe.

Projections show that Britain will have the highest population on the continent within 40 years, overtaking both Germany and France.

Eurostat said the UK's population growth of 409,000 in 2010 amounted to 30 per cent of the 1.4million added to numbers across the whole EU.

The only other country to experience a population increase of more than 300,000 was France.

Britain's population went up at a rate of 6.6 new people for every 1,000 already in the country, well over double the EU average rate of 2.8 for every 1,000.

Only two countries – Belgium and Sweden – and the tiny nations of Malta and Luxembourg saw higher rates of increase.

The figures will fuel concerns over the provision of housing and public services in crowded areas.

Transport, schools, water and energy supplies are all in increasing demand as the UK population heads toward the landmark figure of 70million, which is expected to be reached in 25 years time.

The EU analysis reflects the findings 
of Whitehall officials in attributing two fifths of the population 
increase to immigration and three fifths to 'natural change' – the 
difference between numbers of babies born and the national death toll.

However a substantial share of the baby boom, which is producing  birthrates which match the historic highs in the two decades after the Second World War, is largely a result of high migration.

Around one in four babies is born to a mother who was born outside UK.

Sir Andrew Green of the MigrationWatch think tank, said: 'This is a result of Labour's immigration policies which brought in three million migrants, raising our population both directly and indirectly.

'Many of the additional births over the past ten years have been to mothers born outside the UK.'

A report yesterday revealed that UK migrants from one East African country are much more heavily dependent on the state to provide them with homes than people from any other minority group.

Eight out of ten Somalis were found to live in homes provided by the taxpayer. Yet among every other immigrant nationality, more than half pay for their own housing either by renting it on the private market or through buying their homes.

The findings come from the Institute for Public Policy Research and were revealed yesterday in a report by MigrationWatch.

If the IPPR figures – calculated from official statistics – are correct, then the provision of homes for Somalis is likely have cost taxpayers more than £2billion.

Whitehall officials estimate there are 150,000 Somalis in Britain, most of whom fled civil war and lawlessness that broke out in 1991.

There has been outrage over Somali refugee Saeed Khaliif, who moved with his family into a £2m house in North-West London, at a cost to the public of £8,000 a month.
