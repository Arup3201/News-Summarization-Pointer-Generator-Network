The parents of a baby boy are pleading for thieves to return the silver box they stole, which contains his ashes.

The Georgia couple are distraught at the theft of the box containing their last link to the stillborn son.

Jody and Haley Hughey's only child, Caleb, was stillborn in 2008. Since his death, the couple have struggled to become pregnant again.

Treasured memories: Jody and Haley Hughey kept the ashes of their baby son in a small silver box

'We spent some time with him before we let him go, and then had him cremated,' Mr Hughey told ABC News. 'I realize there are people in Oklahoma going through more than us right now, but for us, it's a personal hell.'

Since his death, the couple have kept their son's ashes in a silver box, engraved with an angel and 'Caleb Ean Hughey, October 16, 2008'.

But when Mrs Hughey returned from work on Monday, she found a second-floor window had been smashed - and the box had been stolen.

'He is only our only son,' Mr Hughey said. 'It's 
devastating for both of us. But for my wife, this is everything. She 
can't have the future she wants, and now she doesn't have a way to hold 
on to the past.'

The box was kept on a dresser in their bedroom, until thieves broke into the couple's home in Cobb County while they were at work on Monday and stole it. 

'They were looking for small, 
valuable stuff,' Mr Hughey said. As well as the box, an iPod, handgun and jewellery were taken.

'What they took from us has absolutely 
no value whatsoever to them,' he added. 'I would ask that they just simply call the police and turn it in. 
And if the person who actually stole it wants to give it back, they can 
drive by my house at 3am and throw it in a garbage bag in my front 
yard. Whatever it takes for them to feel comfortable giving us our son 
back.'

Appeal: Jody Hughey is desperate for the box containing his baby son's ashes to be returned

The 4in by 4in silver box may have been mistaken as a jewellery box, the couple say.

'They may not have even realized what was in there. And they may have simply thought, "that's a nice looking box, there's probably some expensive jewelry in there",' Mr Hughey added.

Joanne Cacciatore, a grief counselor and
founder of Phoenix-based Miss Foundation for grieving families, said 
parents mourn stillborn babies as they would any child.

'When a baby dies during or shortly after
birth, you have very few tangible mementos. So while, of course, this 
would be horrid for anyone, for this family, this is one of the very few
things they have that belongs to their baby,' Ms Cacciatore, who lost her daughter Cheyenne before she was born, said.

For a developed country, the U.S. has a relatively high rate of stillbirths. About one in every 160 pregnancies in the U.S. ends in a stillbirth, which is about 26,000 each year nationwide.

The tragic end to a pregnancy is 'really a very emotional event,' for health professionals as well as the baby's family, Jay Iams, a professor of maternal and fetal medicine at The Ohio State University Medical Center, told Scientific American.

When a couple loses a baby this way, hospitals will encourage them to spend time with their baby and to take pictures to help them remember their lost child.

Caleb was the Hughey's only child. 'We've struggled with infertility for about four or five years now, and we've not been able to have children, other than the one. And he was born prematurely. We lost him at birth.' Mr Hughey told 11 Alive.

As he choked back tears, Mr Hughey added: 'So he is, to us, he is our only son. And it's very important we get him back.'

The couple say the box brought them a comfort that cannot be replaced. 

'My wife said, "I wanted to be 
buried with him so I could be with him forever",' Mr Hughey said. 'I just hope
that somehow word gets out and that someone is willing to do something 
about it.'

It is a sentiment echoed by other grieving parents who have ashes stolen from their homes.

In January, a mother from Bakersfield, California, pleaded for the return of a pink urn containing the ashes of her stillborn daughter.

Paula Lopez had been pregnant with twins when one of the babies, Marie, died. The other twin survived and is now eight years old.

'I already lost her one time. This is like losing her a second time,' Ms Lopez told Bakersfield Now.

Anyone with information about the theft should call (770) 499-4184 and quote case number 13-052156.
