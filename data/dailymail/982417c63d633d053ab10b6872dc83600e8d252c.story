At least 24 people are feared dead after two multi-storey buildings collapsed in the centre of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil - with one survivor saying the scene was 'just like the World Trade Centre'.

Witnesses said an explosion rocked the area before the collapse of the commercial buildings, 20 storeys and ten storeys high, at 8pm last night.

Gilberto Figueiredo, 33, was in a lift coming down from the ninth floor when he felt a tremor followed by a loud snap.

He referenced the 9/11 New York terrorist attacks when talking about the disaster and said: 'When I got to the bottom I ran for the door as the building collapsed around me.

'It was just like the World Trade Centre. Only God got me out of there alive.'

Chaos: At least 11 people are feared dead after two multi-storey buildings collapsed in the centre of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil

A third building, annexed to the city's historic Municipal Theatre, also sustained serious damage.

Emergency services were initially quoted as saying that at least 11 people both inside the buildings and on the street below could have been killed.

Today, the bodies of three people were pulled out of the rubble, another 21 remaining missing and a further six are in hospital.

Many of the missing are students who were taking a night course in computer studies in one of the office buildings.

Others were employees of a consultancy business taking part in a training session on the seventh floor of the smaller of the two buildings.

There was also rumours that a group of beggars had been sleeping underneath one of the office blocks before it collapsed. Another man who was in the lift of one of the buildings when it came down was taken to hospital in a serious condition.

Rumours: A group of beggars were said to have been sleeping underneath one of the office blocks before it collapsed

Dozens of firefighters and emergency workers were last night working to rescue anyone still trapped in the rubble.

And around 50 families spent the night searching for loved ones who were working in the building when it came down.

Rio's civil defence secretary, coronel Sergio Simoes, said he did not believe anyone had survived the tragedy. He said: 'We hope there might be an air pocket and that we might find 
some survivor, but this possibility is lamentably very small.'

Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes said: 'There were people inside, yet, but we can't confirm how many.' Witnesses said there was a strong smell of gas in the moments before the explosion.

But Mr Paes said: 'The possibility of a gas leak is very small. We don't know the cause, but it must have been structural damage and not an explosion. As we get more information we'll pass it on.'

Systems analyse Fernando Amaro, who was working inside the building until moments before it collapsed, told Terra website that people worked in offices there until 9pm.

He said six of his colleagues who had stayed behind for training in a room in the fourth floor were still missing.

He said: 'It all happened very quickly. I saw the doorman run out screaming and the building began to crumble. He was lucky to get out alive.'

Police have cordoned off the area and electricity to the street has been cut off for safety reasons.
