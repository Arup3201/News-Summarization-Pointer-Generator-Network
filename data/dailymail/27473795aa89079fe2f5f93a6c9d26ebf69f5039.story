Paul Scholes believes Barcelona are a 'ghost' of the side they once were and Lionel Messi is bored having won everything club football has to offer.

The former Manchester United midfielder says Barca manager Luis Enrique has a tough task on his hands trying to motivate a team who have 'won it all and conquered the world.'

Scholes attended Barcelona's La Liga match at Valencia last weekend and concluded from their below-par performance that 'something is missing.'

Lionel Messi is 'bored' having won everything with Barcelona, according to Paul Scholes

Writing in his Independent column, Scholes said: 'When I try to find a way of summarising the attitude of the team, and of some longer-serving individuals, I keep alighting on the word "bored".

'It is not meant to sound flippant, but it just seems the most accurate way to describe the way the team seem to treat the style of football that once made them the best side on the planet.'

Scholes claims that Messi, who has won six La Liga titles, two Copa del Reys and three Champions League titles, is struggling to keep himself motivated.

He writes: 'As for Messi, his achievements put him in a different category to the rest of us who played the game. But even so, in him, as much as anyone, I detected that mood of boredom.

Scholes believes Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has a tough job to keep his players motivated 

'He has never been a player given to chasing the full back when his team lose the ball, but now, more than ever, he keeps his movement to an absolute minimum.

'For a young manager like Luis Enrique, it will be hard to change the way Messi, and the rest of the stars in this team, play the game. They have won it all. They have conquered the world.

'Now Enrique has to find a way of persuading them to do it all over again, on his terms.'

Barcelona beat Valencia 1-0 in Sunday's match courtesy of a stoppage time goal from Sergio Busquets and they trail Real Madrid by two points in the table.

They take on Espanyol in the Catalan derby on Sunday.
