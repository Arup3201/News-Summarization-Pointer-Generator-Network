Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho may well have a No 2 in the making in the form of suspended striker Diego Costa, if his actions from behind the dugout on Wednesday night are anything to go by.  

The Brazil-born striker looked as though he could barely sit still as he watched his side battle to a dramatic 1-0 victory against Everton.

The 26-year-old looked perfectly at home with the Blues fans behind him as he cheered Willian's 89th-minute winner before congratulating the Brazilian on his strike.

Costa was sitting out the final match of his three-game ban handed to him for a stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can during Chelsea's 1-0 Capital One Cup semi-final victory in January.

Chelsea have managed two victories plus a draw against Premier League champions Manchester City in his absence, but Mourinho will no doubt be pleased to see the No 19 return to the field.

The Spain international has 17 Premier League goals to his name so far this season and looks set to return to the west London club's starting line-up for next Tuesday's Champions League last-16 clash with Paris Saint-Germain.

Mourinho's squad will be able to enjoy an extended rest period this weekend after being knocked out of the FA Cup by Bradford.
