David Cameron has been urged to slash benefits for European immigrants as it emerged 600,000 are here without a job

David Cameron was last night urged to slash benefits for immigrants from Europe.

The calls came after a study revealed a sharp rise in the number of EU migrants without a job living in Britain to more than 600,000 – the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow.

There was a 73 per cent increase in the number of ‘job-seeking’ EU immigrants in the country in the three years to 2011, according to the European Commission.

The findings led Boris Johnson to urge the Prime Minister to demand a change in EU laws to delay migrants’ access to benefits.

Meanwhile, a poll has found that two-thirds of the public want ministers to take ‘drastic action’ to cut immigration.

Mr Johnson said migrants should have to work for ‘quite a long time’ before they can claim any benefits in this country.

The London Mayor said it was wrong that ‘we have no control over the time lapse between arrival in this country to work and the ability to withdraw benefits’.

And he suggested the Prime Minister should press for a change in the law as part of his renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU.

‘That is something that could be considered by the Government for the renegotiation of the European Treaty that is about to come up,’ he said.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell also called for a clampdown, saying that migrants appeared to be fleeing to Britain to escape the eurozone crisis.

‘We cannot both continue the free-at-the-point-of-use welfare state and benefits system and allow Europeans to flee the eurozone and come here,’ the Eurosceptic MP added.

European Commission figures show there has been a 73 per cent increase in 'job-seeking' EU immigrants

The European Commission study, published today, reveals that in 2012 there were 611,779  economically ‘non-active’ EU migrants living in Britain – up from 431,687 six years ago. The annual cost to the NHS of treating ‘non-active’ migrants is estimated at £1.5billion. The Commission’s  291-page report sheds new light on the impact of EU immigration on Britain.

‘Between 2006 and 2012 there has been a steady increase of 42 per cent in the number of non-active EU migrants in the UK,’ it says.

‘A particularly high increase can be noticed between 2009 and 2011. The number of job-seeking EU migrants increased by 73 per cent, while the total EU migrant population increased by only 28 per cent.’ The report was commissioned by Laszlo Andor, the Commission’s employment commissioner, who is suing Britain over rules that mean some benefits are not immediately available to EU migrants.

A Commission spokesman said it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest the report’s findings meant there are 600,000 unemployed migrants, because the figure includes older children, students, pensioners and other economically inactive adults.

‘All existing studies without any exceptions say that EU migrants are more likely to be in work than the native population and make a positive contribution to the Exchequer,’ he added.

Despite the evidence it uncovers, the report concludes that the impact of ‘non-active’ immigrants on the benefits system is ‘very low’.

But Stephen Booth, of the think-tank Open Europe, said the conclusion was ‘misleading… wilfully or otherwise’.

A poll carried out for Sky News by Survation suggests the public want ministers to take a much tougher stance on immigration.

Sixty-seven per cent said the UK’s population is too high and want ‘drastic action’ to cut immigration, while 52 per cent said they are more likely to vote for a party promising to reduce immigration ‘significantly’. And 27 per cent said the wave of immigration in the last decade had brought no benefit to Britain.

Seventy-four per cent said they were concerned that Romanians and Bulgarians will be allowed unfettered access to Britain from the end of this year.

Britain uses the Habitual Residency Test to establish whether EU migrants are eligible for benefits.

611,779: The number of 'non-active' EU migrants in Britain - up 42 per cent in six years

£1.5bn: Estimated annual cost to NHS of treating 'non-active' migrants

73% increase in the number of 'job seeking' EU migrants in Britain between 2009 and 2011

3.7m: Increase in the population of England and Wales between 2001 and 2011, of which 2.1million attributed to immigration

£2bn: Potential cost of EU bid to end curbs on migrants claiming benefits

67% of public want 'drastic action' to cut immigration

52% of voters say they are more likely to back party promising to cut immigration 'significantly'

To
qualify for jobseekers’ allowance, employment support allowance, 
pension credit and income support they must demonstrate they have either
worked here previously or have a good chance of getting a job.

Last
night the Department for Work and Pensions said it was determined to 
tighten the test to limit migrants’ access to benefits.

But the Commission says this ‘right to reside’ test indirectly discriminates against nationals from other EU states by enforcing a set of conditions that effectively tests their right to state handouts.

The test is being challenged in court by Mr Andor, despite warnings from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith that the existing rules save Britain up to £2billion a year. Mr Duncan Smith pledged last year to toughen up the test to curb ‘benefit tourism’.

A DWP spokesman said: ‘We have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the British benefits system and make sure it is not abused.

‘But we are also going further by strengthening the Habitual Residence Test and time-limiting how long some migrants can claim benefits.

‘Ministers are also working with their counterparts across Europe to address concerns about the abuse of free movement.’
