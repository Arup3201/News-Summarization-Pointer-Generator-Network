Former Liberian President Charles Taylor has been flown to Britain to serve his 50-year sentence for sponsoring atrocities in Sierra Leone's brutal civil war.

The Special Court for Sierra Leone announced that the 65-year-old warlord-turned-president was put on a chartered plane to Britain on Tuesday, where he was turned over to prison officials.

Britain's offer to enforce any jail sentence, which could cost tax-payers up to £80,000 a year, was crucial for his trial to go ahead in the Hague, justice minister Jeremy Wright said when it was announced the UK would impose his sentence.

appeal judgment at The Hague this month, where judges confirmed his 50-year 
sentence for crimes against humanity

Taylor was convicted in April last year of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including terrorism, murder, rape and using child soldiers. He
aided murderous rebels in Sierra Leone's 11-year civil war that ended 
in 2002. His conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal last month. 
Taylor always maintained he was innocent.

The controversial decision to send Taylor to Britain was announced earlier this month following his failed appeal against his convictions - which made him the first former head of 
state convicted by an international court since Nuremberg trials of Nazi
leaders after the Second World War.

After the announcement, Mr Wright said: 'The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice.'

The court's ruling came more than a decade after Taylor helped rebels go on a murderous rampage across war-torn Sierra Leone, raping, murdering and mutilating tens of thousands of innocent victims. 

Taylor had aided and abetted crimes 
committed by Revolutionary United Front and Armed Forces Revolutionary 
Council rebels, while knowing well the kinds of crimes they were 
committing.

Presiding Judge 
George Gelaga King said: 'Their primary purpose was to spread terror. 
Brutal violence was purposefully unleashed against civilians with the 
purpose of making them afraid, afraid that there would be more violence 
if they continued to resist.'

Charles Taylor aided rebels in Sierra Leone during a brutal civil war in the 1990s which left 50,000 people dead.

Thousands more were left mutilated in the conflict that became known for the extreme cruelty of rival rebel groups who hacked off the limbs of their victims and carved their initials into opponents.

Taylor helped to plan attacks in return for 'blood diamonds' mined by slave labourers in Sierra Leone and political influence in the volatile West African region.

He was convicted not only of aiding and abetting Sierra Leone rebels from Liberia, but also for actually planning some of the attacks carried out by Sierra Leone rebel groups, the Revolutionary United Front and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.

The trial opened in June 2007 in The Hague. Taylor boycotted the initial proceedings and dismissed his legal team.

He pleaded not guilty to all 11 charges.

Witness testimony began in January 2008, and ended in November 2010. Closing arguments took place in February and March 2011.

The court heard live testimony from over 90 prosecution witnesses, and received written statements from four additional witnesses. The defence presented 21 witnesses.   

Court hearings included testimony from supermodel Naomi Campbell about a gift of diamonds from Taylor. 

'Governments
and the international community were also afraid that unless the RUF 
and the AFRC demands were met, thousands more killings, mutilations, 
abductions and rapes of civilians would follow.'

Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in jail in May last year, and the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence on September 26 this year.

The head of the SCSL then requested that Taylor now be transferred to a prison in the UK to serve his sentence.

In a statement to MPs today, Justice minister Mr Wright said: 'The United Kingdom’s offer to enforce any sentence imposed on former President Taylor by the SCSL was crucial to ensuring that he could be transferred to The Hague to stand trial for his crimes.'

The International Tribunals (Sierra Leone) Act was backed by all parties in 2007 knowing it could mean Taylor would serve his sentence in the UK with the taxpayer picking up the bill, he said.

'International justice is central to foreign policy. It is essential for securing the rights of individuals and states, and for securing peace and reconciliation.

'The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice. It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity.'

During Taylor's four-year initial trial, judges heard accounts from Sierra Leone civilians who had been mutilated by rebels or who had seen their close relatives murdered.

They also heard evidence from supermodel Naomi Campbell, who was questioned about blood diamonds Taylor was accused of having sent to her hotel room.

She described the objects she received as looking like 'dirty pebbles.'

The court found Taylor provided 
crucial aid to rebels in Sierra Leone during that country's 11-year 
civil war, which left an estimated 50,000 people dead before its 
conclusion in 2002.

Thousands
more were left mutilated in a conflict that became known for its 
extreme cruelty, as rival rebel groups hacked off the limbs of their 
victims and carved their groups' initials into opponents.

The
rebels developed gruesome terms for the mutilations, offering victims 
the choice of 'long sleeves' or 'short sleeves' - having their hands 
hacked off or their arms sliced off above the elbow.

Prosecutors
said he used the proceeds from so-called blood diamonds mined in the 
conflict zone to finance Taylor's activities, which included advising 
and helping the rebels.

Morris Anyah, Taylor's lead 
defence lawyer, complained that Taylor had been prosecuted because of a 
lack of friends in high places.

Referring
to the diplomatic row over action against the regime in Syria, Mr Anyah
said: 'But for two powerful nations, two members of the Security 
Council - Russia and China - Bashar Assad would have been charged and 
indicted by the International Criminal Court. That is not happening 
simply because of political reasons.

'Had
Charles Taylor had as friends any of the five permanent members of the 
Security Council ... this case I dare say would probably not have had 
the sort of traction it had.'

Because
Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court, only the 
Security Council asking the court to investigate could trigger 
jurisdiction there.

And Taylor's supporters in Liberia remained loyal to the former warlord who was later democratically elected the country's president.

The very idea of international courts has come under fire across Africa. The ICC has been accused of neo-colonial meddling in Kenya as it pursues cases against its president and deputy president.

'This is complete international gangsterism,' said Cyril Allen, former secretary general of Liberia's National Patriotic Party. 'The ICC was set up for Africans, to intimidate them and get their resources.'

Taylor's brother-in-law Arthur Saye said he was not surprised by the verdict.

'From day one my position has been that the trial of Mr Taylor was orchestrated by the powers that be - the Western powers,' he told the Associated Press. 'This was an international conspiracy.'

Several African states are considering withdrawing from the ICC, which has only ever prosecuted Africans.
