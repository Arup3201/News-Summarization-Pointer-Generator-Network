Mother-of-two Emma Taylor, from Henley-on-Thames, appeared on television to defend her right to take breastfeeding selfies, as they were named one of 2015's biggest parenting trends by parenting site Netmums.

Like other brelfie advocates such as Ellie Gordon, founder of the Facebook group 'Pump in Public', Emma admitted to regularly posting pictures when she was breastfeeding her daughter, now five, and currently uploads images of herself feeding her six-month-old son.

Yet a growing movement is forming among mothers against the 'brelfie' despite 88 per cent of mothers saying social media sites are wrong to delete the intimate shots.

'Why not share a brelfie?' Emma told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning today.

'You can't see a lot as the baby is in the way. This morning I saw a half naked women with her legs akimbo in the newspaper so if that's okay, why isn't showing the top of my skin on my chest?'

She added that breflies are a way for women to celebrate their bodies and what they can do.

However, Angela Epstein, 46, from Manchester, disagreed. She appeared on the ITV show alongside Emma to argue the case against brelfies.

She said: ‘This whole cult of the breflie smacks of naked exhibitionism.’

While Angela said she supports breastfeeding, she thinks the trend for sharing pictures is 'attention-seeking and using kids as a commodity, parading them around saying "isn't it great I can breastfeed" and rubbing it in the face of women who can't.'

Mothers Emma Taylor, right, and Angela Epstein appeared on today's This Morning to debate the new trend for posting breastfeeding selfies aka 'brelfies'

Emma, left, has posted pictures of herself breastfeeding online and says it celebrates what women's bodies can do. But Angela, right, think it should remain a private, bonding moment between mother and baby 

The growing trend has seen one in five breastfeeding mothers (19 per cent) already take their own brelfie, with a further six per cent of new mothers claiming they plan to. 

They are following the lead of celebrities such as Miranda Kerr, Gisele Bundchen and Gwen Stefani who have all posted their own brelfies online.

The craze was identified as part of the annual Netmums' Parenting Trends Report which predicts the ten key parenting fashions for the forthcoming year. 

But Angela argued on the programme, that  many women who share brelfies are 'deliberately militant in their approach' as if they are saying 'I can breastfeed and if you don't like seeing it, that's your problem'.

Angela believes mothers should not be 'flaunting' themselves online breastfeeding because 'certain things are private, I endorse breastfeeding but it's an intimate, private, bonding moment, just you and your baby.' 

But Angela's views weren't supported by all This Morning viewers as many sent their own brelfies into the show.

A poll carried out by the programme found that 68.53 per cent would post a brelfie online.

Another advocate of the trend is mother-of-four Ellie Gordon, 34, from Hertford, who has a 14-week-old daughter Bluebelle Beatrice as well as Lily-Grace, nine, Ronnie, seven, and Reuben, five. 

She's so passionate about the subject she has even set up her own Facebook group 'Pump In Public' to support breastfeeding mothers.

Other parenting fads of 2015 identified by Netmums include post-baby body nude photoshoots, where women book a professional photographer to capture their figures just days after giving birth. 

The report revealed one in seven new mothers now think the photoshoots are a positive idea, claiming stretch marks and baby weight ‘celebrated them becoming a mum’. But one in 12 mums said they would only have a post-pregnancy photoshoot if they got their bodies back into shape.

Pregnancy Test ‘Pee Parties’ - which see women trying to fall pregnant take their pregnancy test with a group of friends or family members - are also on the rise. 

Popular in America where the parties are often filmed for YouTube, the trend is starting to take off in the UK with one in 25 mums saying they had held one and a further 14 per cent admitting they would consider it.

Despite improving economic conditions, 'Family No-Spend Days' are one of the year's most popular trends. Over two thirds (68 per cent) of families now follow the craze which bans spending in any form for one day a week or each month. 

While 29 per cent of mums quizzed said they only held the days when money was tight, for 39 per cent of families they are a regular occurrence to teach children the value of money.

And following the increasing use of foodbanks, Toybanks are also becoming more popular this year. The service, which offers toys to low-income and struggling families, is opening in locations around the UK with 54 per cent of parents saying they would use it if the need arose.

However, one trend parents want to say goodbye to in 2015 is the Double-Barrelled First Name. 

Girls monikers including Georgia-May, Ellie-Rae and Lily-Rose were voted the most likely naming trend to disappear this year, with 69 per cent of parents saying they would ditch a double-barrelled name.

Another American idea catching on in the UK is Baby Growth Photocards, where parents take monthly or weekly photos of their child against the same background object to show their growth. Some have even been edited into timelapse videos for YouTube, with almost half (46 per cent) of parents saying they are now keeping a regular photographic record of their child’s growth.

According to a Netmums poll, 88 per cent of mothers who say social media sites are wrong to delete breastfeeding selfies

Meanwhile after the success of smash-hit film Frozen, parents are wishing their children would 'Let It Go' – but Disney Princesses are one of the year’s most prominent trends.

But possibly the most controversial trend of the year is 'Pay-ground Parties'. 

First highlighted in the media by a mother invoicing another parent over a no-show at a birthday party, then escalated by TV presenter Myleene Klass after she was asked to club together with other parents to buy birthday presents for two pupils at her daughters’ school, mums are feeling under pressure to pay up much more than they are comfortable with for parties and presents. 

Like Myleene, one in eight said they had been asked to contribute towards a bigger present for a child, but 53 per cent felt the request was 'inappropriate and cheeky'. Meanwhile one in 11 mums would now consider invoicing parents whose child did not turn up for a party they arranged. 

Commenting on the Annual Trends Report, Netmums spokeswoman Rachel Burrows said: 'Parents are more plugged into social media than ever before, so many of this year's trends are all about sharing. 

'From pregnancy parties and baby growth photos, to posting Brelfies and post-baby body shoots, mums are openly showing some of the most intimate moments of their lives in a way that would have been impossible just a few years ago. 

'While some people may see it as oversharing, it's actually very comforting to know others are going through the same situations.

'And trends like the return to retro parties, toybanks and no-spend days show mums are setting a sensible example to their children. 

'Though the last few years have been tough for most families, parents are still ensuring their kids have the best childhood they can, however tight their family finances are.'
