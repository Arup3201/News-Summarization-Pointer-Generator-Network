A toddler looks to have become the latest victim of Tanzania's sickening trade in albino body parts, after machete-wielding kidnappers stormed his home and attacked his distraught mother.

The 18-month-old boy was taken from his home in Chato, on the shores of Lake Victoria, late on Saturday.

His mother could do little after the family home was stormed by the kidnappers, who attacked her with machetes as they stole her son.

It is feared the little boy will be killed, and his body parts will be used in potions and charms which are believed by some to bring luck and wealth.

His father, who was nearby at the time, is now being questioned by police.

'Two bandits armed with machetes stormed into their kitchen, they hit his mother with machetes and took away the baby,' said regional police chief Joseph Konyo. 

He confirmed the father was being questioned, adding: 'We have asked the public for cooperation to arrest the suspects.' 

As the MailOnline has previously reported, albino body parts can fetch thousands of dollars on the black market. 

People are willing to pay as much as $3,000 or $4,000 for a limb, or as much as $75,000 - about £50,000 - for the 'full set', a whole body.

Families are known to sell-off their own children in return for the money - a fortune for someone on the average Tanzanian wage. 

It has left an entire community in fear of their lives: young children with albinism are sent to special schools, where they are kept behind high walls for their own safety. 

Some of those children have already been attacked, and are missing arms or legs lost to their attackers. 

Albino rights groups have warned that, as the country's presidential election approaches in October, the demand for body parts is likely to soar.

Sickening: Tanzania's albino population is being hunted down by people who want to turn their body parts into potions and charms

Victim: Not all those attacked die: Pendo Sengerema, 15, pictured right with campaigner Vicky Ntetema, was one of three people attacked in 11 days last August 

The supposed 'luck' which the charms and potions bring are highly sought after by certain political campaigners, it is thought.

And the prices the witch doctors charge mean the people buying them need to have a substantial amount of money behind them.

Josephat Torner, an albino rights campaigner who works with charity Standing Voice, told MailOnline last month: 'The big fishes are behind the issue. It has been really a big discussion. If I say big fish, or big people, it is those who have enough resources, enough money.

'People sell the body parts for high prices. So it is not really small fish behind it.

'It could be politicians. It could be those people.'

Since people began collecting records of the attacks, there have been 74 killings and 59 survivors of attacks. Even the dead are not safe: 16 graves have been robbed. 

Hereditary: Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes, affecting one Tanzanian in 1,400

In August, three people were attacked in just 11 days, while this most recent kidnapping is the second in less than two months.

A four-year-old girl, called Pendo Emmanuelle Nundi, was reported missing in December, but has never been found.

Her father and uncles were among the 15 questioned - but so far there have been no charges made.

In fact, just 10 people have ever come before the courts, and not one of the 'buyers' has ever been named.

Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. It affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding, experts say. In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000. 

Albinos are seen as curses, or 'ghosts' who can be wiped off the face of the earth, in many part of Tanzania, and across Africa.

Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes, albinism affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding in remote and rural communities, experts say.

In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000. 

Families are often told to kill the children at birth. Yet, conversely, their body parts are highly prized.

But Josephat Torner sees the two as being intrinsically linked.

'The killings and attacks is the outcome of the stigma and discrimination. If you respect me, you won't think of me as a commodity,' he said. 

Witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches, power and success, if used in potions, while a UN report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets, or would bury them where they are drilling for gold.

Fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish. 

Children are particularly vulnerable: their innocence is highly valued, and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them.

Most of the time, limbs are taken - but the report notes there have been cases where victims were beheaded, genitals, ears, and bits of skin were removed; tongues were cut out and the eyes and the heart gouged out.

Other types of attacks reported included rape for healing purposes.

Possibly most shockingly, some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed, the more potent the charm.
