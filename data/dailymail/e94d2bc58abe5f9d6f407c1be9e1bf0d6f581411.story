Australian tennis player Marinko 'Mad Dog' Matosevic has slammed women's tennis and said he would never copy Andy Murray, who recently hired a female coach.

His comment that he would never follow in the footsteps of Wimbledon champion Murray, who has appointed French former world No.1 tennis player Amelie Mauresmo as his coach, has overshadowed one of the biggest wins of his career.

Matosevic, who is world No.60, beat ninth-seed Croatian Marin Cilic in an opening-round 6-4 6-4 upset win at the Queen's Club Aegon Championship in London on Tuesday.

'For me, I couldn't do it since I don't think that highly of the women's game,' Matosevic, 28, said of Murray's decision.

'His mum coached him and she did a great job with him, so we'll see what happens.

'It's all equal rights these days. Got to be politically correct. So, yeah, someone's got to give it a go. Won't be me.'

Bosnia-born Matosevic acknowledged there are 'a few guys' in the top 100 who are coached by women.

'I think [Mikhail] Kukushkin is coached by his wife, Denis [Istomin] by his mum, she's done a great job with him,' he said.

Matosevic has been knocked out in the first round in all but one of his 12 grand slam singles appearances. His best result was at the French Open this year where he reached the second round.

MailOnline contacted Australian tennis player Sam Stosur, who will play Christina McHale at the Aegon Classic in Birmingham on Wednesday, but she declined to comment.

Australian Womensport and Recreation Association secretary Janice Crosswhite said the comments were sexist but they had a more damaging effect on Matosevic than on female tennis players.

'I think it reacts against that individual more than it affects the women's game,' Ms Crosswhite said.

'You know, they're out of step with their time, and it does show a degree of sexism still, that what men do is always going to be better what women do.'

In grand slams men play best of five sets while women play best of three.

'I think that's why maybe some of the men look at the women's circuit as being second rate,' Ms Crosswhite said.

'Because they're playing best of three.'

Matosevic said his coach, Australian former tennis player Mark Woodforde, had challenged him to be more aggressive on the court an play the 'old school Aussie way'.

'All the older Aussies came forward, you know, and the match was on their racquet, you know, very attacking players because they grew up on grass,' he said.

'It's kind of got lost in the last decade since [Pat] Rafter retired, and [Lleyton] Hewitt was playing a so it got lost, I guess.'

World No.5 Murray will work with two-time grand slam winner Mauresmo for the four-week grass season.

Some players, included Roger Federer, have publicly supported the move but the Brit said he didn't care if there was criticism.
