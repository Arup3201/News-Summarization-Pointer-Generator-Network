The last drops: The ban on hosepipes and sprinklers in the South and East of England will be the most widespread for seven years

Confusion reigned over the impact of the hosepipe ban last night – as the country endures the worst drought in 90 years.

Just days before a ban comes into force millions of householders have been left in the dark over which rules apply following a series of U-turns from water companies about exemptions for pensioners, businesses and gardeners.

The ban on hosepipes and sprinklers in the South and East of England will be the most widespread since 2005 with the drought now more severe than the summer of 1976.

A large area of Yorkshire is now in a state of drought and groundwater 
levels across England and Wales have dropped to the lowest level on the 
Government's scale.

Experts say that twice the average rainfall will be 
required over the coming months to replenish the water table.

It was 1921 when the UK last went through a drought as bad as the current crisis.

The dry arid conditions thought to have partly inspired TS Eliot's famous poem The Wasteland - although commentators believe it was also an allegory for the First World War.

The work was partly written in Margate which that year broke the record for receiving a total yearly rainfall of just 236mm which meant it technically classed as a desert.

It is hoped that restrictions by seven suppliers, due to come into effect on Thursday will enable the country to cope with such a severe drought this summer.

Consumer groups and MPs yesterday called on water companies to provide clearer, more consistent information.

Last month the companies issued an 11-point diktat in an attempt to stop customers flouting the terms, backed up by the threat of fines of £1,000 if they are prosecuted.

Three weeks ago, hundreds of 
thousands of pensioners were told they would be spared from the ban. But
company bosses scrapped the exemption this week following complaints 
from younger customers.

Other
water companies told gardeners that drip hoses – which allow only a 
trickle of water – were banned. But they have since changed their mind, 
and now say irrigation  systems are permitted.

March
has been particularly dry and warm, with an average temperature of 
8.5C, about 3C above the normal, making it potentially the third driest 
March since records began in 1659.

Last
week most areas of the UK received less than 1mm of rainfall and the 
dry conditions have caused streams and rivers in Herefordshire, 
Glouestershire Oxfordshire and Yorkshire to dry up. The Environmental 
Agency is now on standby to transfer fish to safety.

Taking a dip: The UK is suffering the worst drought since 1921. This photo shows three young women cooling off at Herne Bay in August that year.

Inspired: The arid landscape of drought hit England in 1921 is believed to have partly inspired TS Eliot's acclaimed poem The Wasteland.

Rules on which businesses are allowed to clean patios, paths and decking in domestic gardens have also changed.

A spokesman for the Consumer Council for Water said: ‘It is very important that the companies are consistent in their information to customers about what they can and can’t do.’

Norman Baker, Lib Dem MP for Lewes in East Sussex, which is covered by Southern and South East Water, told the Mail: ‘I am dismayed by the uncertainty which has been created about who is  eligible for help and who is not and where the bans are.

‘It is imperative that South East and Southern Water make the situation clear to my constituents.’

The restrictions – imposed by 
Southern Water, South East Water, Thames Water, Anglian Water, Sutton 
and  East Surrey, Veolia Central and Veolia South East – will start 
before the Easter Bank Holiday weekend, one of the busiest times of the 
year for gardeners.

Two 
weeks ago South East Water, which supplies two million people in Kent, 
Sussex, Hampshire, Surrey and Berkshire, said all customers over 65 
would be spared from the ban.

But
this week, the company said: ‘We have revised it as a result of 
feedback from other customers who didn’t  think it was a fair 
concession. It was also confusing because other water companies weren’t 
doing the same  thing.’

While
more than 250 water abstraction licences have been cut for farmers, the
mild, dry weather has benefited commercial tomato growers who are in 
the unusual position of being able to harvest their crop a month early 
and 100 tonnes are expected to be picked on the Isle of Wight next week.
