West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady says there is 'no place anywhere in football' for convicted rapist Ched Evans.

The Welsh striker, who last played for Sheffield United, left Wymott Prison in Lancashire on Friday after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel.

It has emerged that the Blades continued to pay Evans after he was convicted of rape in April 2012 and there is speculation he could return to play for the Bramall Lane club.

But Brady, writing in her column in The Sun, said there is 'no way' her club West Ham would employ him.

She said: 'Rape is a most serious crime and there is simply no way I would agree with West Ham employing a convicted rapist.

'Ched Evans, unanimously convicted by a jury with even the judge rejecting his right to appeal, would have no place at my club.

'And there should be no place for him anywhere in football. It is impossible to think he can slip back into his old life so easily.'

She went on to express sympathy for the victim, who has suffered abuse on social media and has been forced to change her name and move home. 

The Sun reported on Saturday that Evans is on the verge of signing a £500,000 contract with United and could be back in training by next week.

However, as a condition of his contract Evans - who still maintains he is innocent - must make a public apology.
