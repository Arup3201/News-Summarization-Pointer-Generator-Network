President Obama has clearly stayed in style as Anna Wintour,
the editor-in-chief of Vogue, has raised a total of $2.7million for the
commander-in-chief and his fellow Democrats since 2008.

According to newly-released campaign finance reports, the
President has cultivated a larger and more monied group of wealthy donors for
the 2012 presidential bid than he did during his inaugural race.

Those bold-faced names who write checks and host fundraisers
to convince their friends to do the same- dubbed 'bundlers' for their hefty
donations- include Marissa Mayer, the former Google executive who just recently
became the CEO of Yahoo, actress Eva Longoria who doubles as one of the
co-chairs for the re-election campaign, and the discerning editor herself.

Made the cut: Anna Wintour, a large Obama donor, and her longtime partner Shelby Bryan were invited to the State Dinner at the White House when Prime Minister David Cameron came to visit in March.

Ms Wintour, who is a dual citizen of the United States and
her native Britain, is the fourth-highest-grossing bundler over the past four
years, bringing in a total of $2.7million for the President and fellow
Democrats.

The data comes from financial records obtained by The New
York Times, and while it portrays a varied and deep-pocketed group of funders,
they only refer to donations made up until May of this year. As a result, any
of the tens-of-millions raised over the summer and after the Democratic
National convention is not included.

Wintour has lent hosted a number of fundraisers for the
President in the past few months, all of which have shown the strength of her Rolodex.

In May, she co-hosted a $40,000-per-plate dinner for 50
people in actress Sarah Jessica Parker's Manhattan townhouse. Prior to the
dinner, she even appeared in a YouTube video promoting the dinner which offered
up two raffled tickets to the event.

In August, she moved her sights out of the city and
partnered up with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and his fashion designer
wife Georgina Chapman to host a $38,500-per-plate dinner in their Connecticut
home.

Moving down the list of his top fundraisers, Longoria and
Mayer's names stand out given their star power.

Longoria, known best for her role on Desperate Housewives,
raised $271,300 for the President since 2011 and she does not simply write
checks. She has made numerous campaign appearances- particularly those aimed at
attracting younger and minority voters. She even gave a speech at the
Convention stage in Charlotte, North Carolina.

While the records show that Longoria only started bundling
during this campaign, Mayer's devotion to Democratic causes dates back to 2007.

Over the past two years, Mayer has been responsible for
$112,400 but all told, her bundling has contributed $386,000.

Increased access and prominent political appointments are
common rewards for top bundlers, and that presents a problem that President
Obama's campaigners have to contend with that the Romney camp does not face: he
awarded political positions and ambassadorships to a number of his top contributors
from 2008. As a result, those individuals are barred from giving this time
around because of federal election laws.

Former ambassadors: Steven Green, who served as ambassador to Singapore, and Elizabeth Bagley, who was ambassador to Portugal, were both appointed by Clinton and now are bundlers for Obama

Those laws, however, do not apply to former ambassadors
which explains why two of former President Bill Clinton-appointed ambassadors
have become Obama bundlers.

Former ambassador to Singapore, Steven Green, has raised
$545,300 for the President, as has former ambassador to Portugal, Elizabeth
Frawley Bagley, who has raised more than $1.5million for the President and
Democrats since 2007.

Considering her prominent position on the donor list and the
cycle of turning donors into ambassadors, it comes as little surprise that
Wintour's name has been floated as a possibility.

Though the fashion world may stop turning as a result, she
has never publicly discussed the option. Perhaps next season.
