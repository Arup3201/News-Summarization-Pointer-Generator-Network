New pictures show what life is like inside London's cat cafe, which offers stressed out city folk a unique way to unwind with a cup of tea and a chance to spend time with some chilled-out moggies.

Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium is marketing itself to the many people in the city who live in small flats and who are unable to keep pets, but want a little bit of relaxing animal attention.

Cat cafes first took off in Japan 10 years ago, and have since been established in areas across the UK, but this is the first to set up shop in the capital city.

Named after Alice's cat in Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland', Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium is an archetypal English tea room in east London, serving afternoon tea, sandwiches, cake and scones.

However, the main draw of the cafe is the 'feline company', which costs £5 for two hours of company with some of the cafe's in-house cats.

In a city where many people live alone in cramped high-rise apartment blocks that don't allow pets, making feline friends has become popular therapy for lonely or anxious workers.

One customer, Sara Lewis, who spoke while stroking a cat, said: 'I can see how this would be good for someone lacking company.'

Cafe owner Lauren Pears raised money for the cat emporium through crowd-funding on the internet

The cafe cost just over £100,000 to set up, and was funded largely through donations via crowd-sourcing from interested people

The cafe had a series of hiccups when setting up, including delays in planning permission of over a year

Other delays included figuring out how to manage health and safety standards in a cafe that is both serving food, and full of cats

The cafe opened last month, and is now fully booked until the end of June.

It was established raised through a crowd-funding campaign on the internet, where the owner Lauren Pears racking up a massive £109,000 in donations to get it up and running.

The set-up was not easy though, as Pears had to contend with figuring out how to maintain health and safety standards in a cafe serving food that is riddled with almost a dozen cats.

The cafe is not the first to open in the UK, but is the first to open in London, currently set up east of the city's financial district

The idea for the cafe originally came from Japan, where animal cafes are a relatively common occurance

Cat cafes became incredibly popular in Japanese cities because many single people live in small high-rises where they can't keep pets - the cafes were a chance for feline company

The idea of the cafe is to give stressed-out Londoners who can't own pets a bit of animal therapy

The cafe currently has eleven cats in residence, all of which were given to the establishments by people leaving the country who couldn't take their pets with them

While space is dominated by a cafe setting, there is also a great deal of room employed purely for people to play with cats, and to let the cats play themselves with toys

On top of that, Pears encountered almost a year of planning permission delays, but she says the hard work has all been worth it.

The 11 resident cats were donated by people leaving the country who could no longer look after them.

Cat welfare in the emporium is paramount, with staff on hand who have been trained by in cat care by animal behaviorists, and the resident felines getting regular breaks away from people.

Cat cafes are now opening up across the UK, in places like Paris, Vienna, and San Francisco

Pet therapy is becoming common in very urban areas, with many people craving relaxation from time with animals, but being unable to own them

The trend of 'animal cafes' is set to keep going, with a dog cafe planned to open in London later this year

The cat cafe has proved incredibly popular in its first month, and is now completely booked with cat visits until June

Lisa Vann brought her 8-year old daughter, who has learning difficulties, to Lady Dinah's for a playdate.

Vann said: 'She's delighted to be here.'

Meanwhile, across the world, animal cafe craze shows no signs of slowing down, with new establishments now open in other parts of the UK, Vienna and Paris.

A dog cafe, House of Hounds, is scheduled to open in London later this year. 

American
 animal-lovers won't be missing out for much longer either, with two cat cafes 
due to open in the San Francisco Bay area by the end of 2014.
