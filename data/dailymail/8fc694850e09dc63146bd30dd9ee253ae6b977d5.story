A 58-year-old Florida man allegedly looked at pornography before attacking another man and trying to rape him and steal his money Sunday afternoon.

Phuc X. Kieu's alleged victim took money out of a Gainesville ATM at 4:25pm, a police report from the Gainesville Police Department says.

'The defendant [Kieu] parked his vehicle (green Honda Civic), laid the driver's seat all the way back and proceeded to watch homosexual pornography on a portable DVD player,' the report says.

It continues 'As the victim passed the driver's side of the vehicle, the defendant exited, grabbed the victim, punched him in the mouth and grabbed he bag containing the money the victim withdrew.'

Kieu, of Orlando, then allegedly tried to undress the man, who was able to get out of Kieu's Civic, the report says.

At the time, Kieu also allegedly tried to take the man's backpack from him, which contained the money from the ATM.

The man shouted 'Rapist' when he dashed to shopping center, and a witness told police he saw Kieu in pursuit of the man, the report says.

'At some point during the struggle, the victim's money was taken approximately $220,' the report says.

According to the police report, Kieu was nabbed while rushing back to the Civic.  

Kieu is being held, with bail set at $150,000 for robbery, kidnapping and sexual assault charges, a booking page with the Alachua County Jail reveals.

The Gainesville Sun, which earlier reported on the arrest, said police had verified Kieu's name.
