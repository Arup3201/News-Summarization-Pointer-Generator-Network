Laura Spalding, 27, was left speechless when she spotted 'Will You Marry Me' written in the grass during a 45-minute glider flight at her local airfield. 

Ian Rawling gave his girlfriend the flying lesson as a birthday treat but had secretly planned to surprise her by popping the question.

The 46-year-old had spent several weeks secretly designing and making the letters in his living room using 80 metres of wallpaper and string.

Ian Rawling proposed to his girlfriend Laura Spalding during a gliding lesson at their local flying centre 

Despite her tearful reaction, Laura ran over to Ian after landing the aircraft and said 'yes'.

The proposal was captured on film after Ian's friends at The Gliding Centre in Husbands Bosworth, Leics, helped him plan his surprise last Sunday.

Yesterday, Laura, a physiotherapist, said: 'On my birthday, Ian took me out in the car and we drove past the gliding club.

'When he turned in I thought that was a great idea for a present as I love action things like that.

'I'd done a sky dive but never had a chance to get in a glider despite the fact I live so close to the centre.

'I went up for what was meant to be a half hour trip and I think I noticed that it seemed to be going on longer, but I just thought that was something to do with it being my birthday.

'Rob the pilot kept radioing in and they said the runway was busy and I just thought nothing of it.

'I thought that he may propose when we went away in a few weeks, but I never expected this.

'When Rob got the call that the runway was clear he flew back but then banked the plane around and I could see something on the ground.

Ian popped the question by spelling out the words, 'Laura Will You Marry Me' using giant white letters (right) on the grass of their local flying centre as she flew overhead in a glider 

'When I saw the words 'Will you marry me', I couldn't believe it. 

I was so shocked I burst into tears and think I swore a lot.

'I couldn't believe he had done something like that, I was in complete and utter shock and I was actually quite emotional.

'When we landed again Ian was waiting and he gave me this beautiful ring. 

Laura has revealed she burst into tears after spotting the proposal while flying above the flying centre during a gliding lesson 

'Of course I said yes. It was a wonderful day and something I will never forget.'

The couple, who have been together for two years after meeting on an online dating website, plan to get married next year.

Computer programmer Ian revealed his plan almost turned to disaster when had to pin the letters down with knives and forks after running out of tent pegs.

Ian, from Northamptonshire, said: 'I really don't know where I came up with the idea, I guessed that she would think on her birthday was a really obvious place time to do it.

'I knew she liked the idea of gliding so I booked the lesson and spoke to the club about my plans.

Ian was pleased when he saw Laura's on the in-flight video recording after admitting she wasn;t an easy woman to surprise 

'They were really helpful, it was even there idea to put the cameras on.

'I then had to make the letters in my living room one at a time.

'On the day Laura went up and the club lent me a guy to help, and we set about putting the letters up.

'But when we were about two thirds done I ran out of tent pegs so we had to find something else to use.

'Eventually we got to the canteen and found knives and forks we could use.

'I had been carrying the letters around in my car all day, Laura had been in the boot several times and I had to try and hide all this amount of wallpaper and string.

'But eventually we got it done and when she came down I got on one knee and she said yes.

'She isn't normally someone to show her emotions in a big way so the reaction on the video was amazing.

'I managed to surprise her which isn't easy with her so I felt really good.'
