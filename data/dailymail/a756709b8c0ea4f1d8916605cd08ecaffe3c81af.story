Ash dieback is still decimating the countryside, and threatening healthy trees like his one, almost a year after it first struck in Britain

Tree disease ash dieback is still decimating the countryside almost a year after it first struck in Britain.

The deadly fungus, which is rife across mainland Europe, is now out of control in the East and South East of England and there have been outbreaks in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Somerset was confirmed as the 15th English county with the fungal disease after staff on the National Trust’s Holnicote Estate near Minehead discovered blighted leaves on a handful of ash trees this month.

The latest official figures reveal there are 571 infected sites in Britain, with 334 linked to imported ash trees, 213 in the wider environment and 24 in nurseries.

But the actual figure could be higher because as the disease has taken hold, there has been less urgency to report new cases.

Forestry Commission staff are now conducting a new survey of woodlands in the East and South East of England to gain a clearer picture of the how disease has spread in the wild.

Infected trees are no longer being felled, in the hope of finding mature trees that are resistant to the disease, which is known as Chalara fraxinea.

Once the traits associated with resistance are identified, resistant trees can be developed.

Ash dieback was found for the first time in the National Forest last month, at three sites near the town of Swadlincote in Derbyshire.

Mike Seville, forestry and woodlands adviser at the Country Land and Business Association, said: ‘There is a general acceptance that it is going to be impossible to eradicate the disease and slow the spread.’

Austin Brady, head of conservation at the Woodland Trust, said: ‘Ash dieback has spread across the country in devastating fashion over the past 12 months.

'It has become clear that stopping its spread is an impossible task. What we need to focus on now is building a resilient wooded landscape.

‘By doing so our precious woodland stands a better chance of resisting the many threats posed by disease.’

The Forestry Commission denied the disease was ‘out of control’ but a spokesman said: ‘Everyone agrees  it is currently neither possible nor feasible to eradicate it.

‘Sensibly, efforts are concentrating on monitoring and slowing the disease. Infected ash trees that were planted some time ago have been found at a small number of sites, but more research would  be required to check if they were infected when they were planted or more recently.’

Plant health chiefs confirmed the first case of the disease in the British countryside last October at Pound Farm in Suffolk, a site owned by the Woodland Trust.

As autumn sets in, it is easy to spot diseased ash trees because their leaves are black and do not fall.
