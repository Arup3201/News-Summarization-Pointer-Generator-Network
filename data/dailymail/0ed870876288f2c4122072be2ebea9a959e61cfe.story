Desperate childless women who smuggle babies into the country ought to receive some sympathy, a top judge has ruled.

According to Lord Justice Toulson, women who break the law to bring a child home should be shown mercy, not treated as ‘people traffickers’.

The comments came as he presided over the case of Carmen Thomas, who was so desperate to become a mother that she pretended a girl born in the Philippines to a couple ‘who could not afford to keep her’ was her own.

Lord Justice Toulson said childless mothers like Carmen Thomas, pictured with husband Mark, should not be treated as 'human traffickers'. Mrs Thomas was jailed after trying to smuggle a baby into the UK

Mrs Thomas was jailed after giving the baby her surname, signing her birth certificate and seeking a resettlement visa for her.

But she will be freed next month after judges in London’s Criminal Appeal Court understood her overwhelming desire for a child and said she ought not to be treated as a ‘people trafficker’.

Mrs Thomas, 50, from Sunderland, attempted to circumvent the UK’s complex adoption laws by making plans to smuggle the baby illegally into the country.

After visiting the islands with husband Mark, a security guard, she tried to bring the baby back with her by pretending she had given birth to her there.

But discrepancies on Mrs Thomas’s passport when she applied to embassy officials for a visa for the baby ‘gave the lie’ to her claim of motherhood and revealed that she had not been in the Philippines at the time she reported she had given birth.

The application for a settlement visa 
was ‘unsurprisingly rejected’ and she was arrested on her return to the 
UK.

The judge said that although a crime, she was motivated by 'her and her husband's desire to adopt a child'

She was jailed for six months at Newcastle Crown Court on January 
22, having pleaded guilty to trying to facilitate a breach of 
immigration laws.

However, Lord Justice Toulson, sitting with Mr Justice Griffith Williams and Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, cut her sentence by a third, meaning she will be freed next month.

Mrs Thomas travelled to the islands in May 2011, and, in June of that year, approached immigration officials at the British Embassy in Manila for a UK settlement visa for the child.

Despite her failed attempt to bring the baby back to the UK, Mrs Thomas had bonded so much with her during their few weeks together that she is continuing to provide financial support for her, the court heard.

Lord Justice Toulson said: ‘She and her husband had wanted to adopt a child, and she had believed she had adopted the baby.

She will be freed next month after the hearing at the Criminal Appeal Court, at the Royal Courts of Justice

‘She had posed as the birth mother because she knew it would have taken a long time to complete the adoption process in the Philippines and the UK. This was an attempt – not a sophisticated one, but it was persisted in – to circumvent legal adoption proceedings. The offence was completely out of character.

‘She attempted to facilitate the entry into the UK, knowing that her actions constituted a breach of immigration law. This was a deliberate attempt to circumvent the immigration laws, which required much foresight and planning.

‘Offending like this calls for general deterrence, but it is important to note that what was motivating Mrs Thomas was her and her husband’s desire to adopt a child, and this was not a case of trafficking.

‘While an immediate custodial sentence was inevitable, and that sentence must reflect the need for deterrence, we are satisfied that a sentence of four months imprisonment was sufficient in these circumstances.’
