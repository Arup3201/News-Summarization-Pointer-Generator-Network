A nanny has been charged with assaulting a three-year-old boy that she was supposed to be caring for in Sherborn, Massachusetts.

Mareike Arbeiter, 23, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with one count of domestic assault and battery. 

Arbeiter arrived from Germany six weeks ago to act as an au pair to the two young children of the unnamed family who alerted police to the assault.

They became suspicious after their kids started acting up and so set up hidden cameras to keep an eye on their nanny.

Prosecutors say they have video evidence of her violently shoving a toddler to the ground on Tuesday, reports WCVB.

Sherborn police arrested Arbeiter on Wednesday at the home where she lived and was supposed to be caring for the 3-year-old boy she is accused of assaulting and his 1-year-old sister.

'When the police spoke to her about physically assaulting my son, she was very cold,' the child's father told the judge as he sought a restraining order on the family's behalf.

'She told them, 'He was driving me crazy.' She had no regret.'

The father told the judge that he noticed both children had been 'acting up' lately and said he had a 'gut feeling' that Arbeiter may have been to blame.

The German woman had only been an au pair for a family in the upscale Massachusetts town of Sherborn for six weeks

Reviewing video footage he'd taken of the nanny on Wednesday, he caught an assault that had occurred the previous day.

'She grabbed him by the shoulder and shoved him hard enough that his head snapped back and he fell to the ground,' the father said.

'She left the room, and then came back, and instead of walking around him, she stepped over him. He was face down, crying.'

Though there were no visible injuries on the child, the father said his wife had taken the boy to the doctors as a precaution. 

The judge granted the restraining order and Arbeiter is banned from having any contact with the family.

She was ordered held on $2,000 cash bail and is due back in court next month.

Sherborn police have taken Arbeiter's passport, and Au Pair In America, the company that connected her to the family, are providing her with somewhere to stay until the case was resolved.

'We take any such allegations seriously and we have launched an investigation into the issue,' said a spokesperson for the company.
