Sven Goran Eriksson claims England have 'absolutely no chance' of winning the World Cup in Brazil. The former England manager, who quit his role after the quarter-final exit in Germany in 2006, claims their best hope is to make the last eight.

Eriksson said: 'They're not winning, absolutely not winning. England are going to have problems in Brazil. 

'They are not going to win the World Cup, absolutely not. If they get to the quarter-final or more it's a success. I don't think England will win the World Cup.

'Anything more than the quarter-final would be a tremendous success.  There are many teams that are better than England.'

Eriksson also claimed Wayne Rooney remains England's best player as the debate about his selection continues ahead of the World Cup opener against Italy on June 14.

The Swede, who also coached Manchester City, Leicester and Notts County during his spell in English football, is also a huge admirer of Daniel Sturridge.

The Swede 
said: 'Rooney must start for England, there is no doubt about that. He 
is the most important player for England even though Daniel Sturridge is
 their best attacker right now.

'Sturridge is a superstar who has blossomed this season. He can score a lot of goals in the World Cup.

'That's fantastic. Sturridge is a really big star. I don't think this is about courage, it's about doing things right.

'You have to dare to change generations sometimes and this is the right time.'
