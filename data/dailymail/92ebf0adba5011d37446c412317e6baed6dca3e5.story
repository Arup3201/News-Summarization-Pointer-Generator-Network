A former Disney executive accused of being part of a Hollywood sex ring that abused a minor has filed a lawsuit against his accuser, claiming that it was part an extortion plot to extort money for prominent gay men in the entertainment industry.

David Neuman was named last April by aspiring actor and model Michael Egan, 31, as one of a number of men who he alleged sexually abused him when he was 15 at various L.A. pool parties and during two Hawaiian vacations in 1999 when he was 17.

Egan and his lawyer Jeff Herman held a news conference to make their graphic claims, but the case quickly fell apart and by June they had been forced to withdraw their allegations against Neuman.

Now Neuman is suing both Egan and Herman for smearing his reputation, reports The Wrap.

In a complaint filed on Monday, he accused them of hatching 'a despicable scheme to enrich themselves by inventing and then litigating totally false claims which they would then use to extort settlement payments.'

The complaint goes on to allege that Egan and Herman 'expected that rather than fight these vicious and provably false clams, Mr. Neuman would simply choose to pay defendants a sum of money to settle the claims and end the litigation.'

Neuman says that the pair planned to target other gay men in the entertainment industry to 'intimidate and extort fraudulent settlements' from them 'by threatening to ruin their lives forever' with false accusations of sexual abuse.

Egan had also sued X-Men director Bryan Singer, theater producer Gary Wayne Goddard and former television executive Garth Ancier.

All of the defendants denied the claims and the charges were all eventually dropped.

The case against Neuman collapsed after it was revealed that Egan had said in an statement under oath in 2003 that Neuman was not in Hawaii with him and didn't sexually assault him or engage in any kind of sexual behavior with him.

'Now, more than 10 years after signing the declaration, plaintiff inexplicably has chosen to suddenly claim that Mr. Neuman had engaged in the very conduct which 10 years earlier he swore Mr. Neuman had no part of,' said lawyers for Neuman last June.

Neuman has worked for Disney and CNN as a TV executive.
