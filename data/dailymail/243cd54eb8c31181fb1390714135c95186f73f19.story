Police say a Pennsylvania woman high from smoking methamphetamine has fatally shot her husband after mistaking him for an intruder.

Police say 31-year-old Trista Zickefoose shot her 40-year-old husband, Greg, on Sunday night at their duplex apartment in Knox Township, about 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.

Authorities say that the couple had argued after smoking the drug together and that Trista Zickefoose later heard a noise that she believed was from an intruder.

Incident: Police say 31-year-old Trista Zickefoose shot her 40-year-old husband, Greg, on Sunday night

Incident: The shooting reportedly took place at the couple's duplex apartment in Knox Township

Police say she grabbed a 9mm pistol she kept under her pillow and fired a warning shot.

Police say her husband tried to take the gun away from her, but she shot him in the chest. She remains jailed Tuesday on a charge of criminal homicide.

Court records don't list an attorney for her.

Neighbor Ray Chappel told WJAC 'Well, I was awake last night and I heard a sound, I didn’t know if it was a gunshot or what. I wasn't expecting it.

They seem to be nice people. She was nice. She used to walk her little girl down the street all the time.'

Another neighbor, Regina Sarvey, told WTAJ 'What woke me up was the flash of the cameras it was so bright and they were taking pictures over at this neighbor's yard. I've seen them walking their dog and I've seen their little kids.

Nathan Britton, who also lives in the community, told the television station 'I saw some flashing lights and what not out back here and I was looking around and saw they were across the street and there was fire trucks and an ambulance.'
