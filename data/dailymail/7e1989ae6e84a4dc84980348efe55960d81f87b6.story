A police watchdog is investigating after a man died in custody today.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed it has launched a probe following the death of the man, 43, who was being held Washington police station in Northumbria, in the early hours of this morning.

The man, who has not been named, had been arrested on a warrant on Thursday for failing to appear at court and was being held in police cells pending a rescheduled appearance, the IPCC said.

Northumbria Police said an ambulance was called to take the man to hospital on the recommendation of a force doctor shortly after 11.30pm last night, but that his condition deteriorated further prompting a second, emergency call.

The prisoner was pronounced dead upon arrival at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead at around 1am this morning.

An IPCC spokesman said: 'The available records indicate police officers requested the attendance of a police doctor in the evening on Friday 29 March and an ambulance was called at around 11:30 pm.

'The man was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead where he was pronounced dead at around 1am today.

'His next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem will take place later this afternoon,' he said.

'IPCC family liaison managers will meet with the man's family at the earliest opportunity to explain our role and to update them on our investigation.'

A Northumbria Police spokesman said officers arrested the man on warrant at his home in Houghton after he failed to appear at Gateshead Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.

He had been due to appear in court for possessing an offensive weapon. The court date was rescheduled for today and the man was being held in custody at Washington police station in the meantime.

The spokesman said: 'At 11.39pm, on Friday, March 29, an ambulance was called to the custody suite at Washington at the request of the doctor to transport the prisoner to hospital for medical assistance. However, the prisoner deteriorated and a further call as an emergency was made. Upon arrival at hospital, the man was pronounced dead.'

The force said it is 'fully co-operating' with the IPCC's investigation.

Chief Superintendent Kay Blyth, Sunderland Area Commander, said: 'We offer our sincere condolences to this man's family and friends at what is clearly a difficult time for them. 'Any death in police custody irrespective of the circumstances must be immediately referred to the IPCC and we are working with them to fully assist with their investigation. 'When a person is arrested, a full risk assessment is carried out and a suitable care plan is developed and implemented. We routinely revise these risk assessments during the time the prisoner remains in custody and amend the care plan accordingly. 'Deaths in police custody are fortunately relatively ucommon and there were no custody deaths in the Northumbria Police area last year. 'The police officers and police staff who work in the custody environment receive a higher standard of first aid training than regular officers. This enables them to provide an effective, immediate response in the event of a medical emergency until a doctor or paramedic is available,' said Chief Sup. Blyth.'The circumstances surrounding this incident is subject to an independent investigation by the IPCC and we are giving it our full co-operation.'
