UKIP yesterday pledged to fast-track British passport holders through airport customs in their own queue.

Nigel Farage said he wanted one queue for Britons and ‘one line for the rest of the world’ to help weed out illegal immigrants.

Giving his speech at the party’s conference, he claimed Ukip was ‘parking its tanks’ on Labour’s lawn and now threatened ‘the entire British political class’.

Man of the people: Nigel Farage talks to workmen over breakfast at a Doncaster cafe yesterday

UKIP leader Nigel Farage delivered his key note speech during the party's annual conference in Doncaster

Mr Farage told supporters  the party was not only a threat to the Tories but 'to the entire British political class'

Mr Farage was loudly cheered by UKIP supporters throughout his speech as he attacked Labour and the Tories

He promised to take his fight to Labour’s heartlands as Ukip unveiled a package of policies to broaden the party’s appeal.

Mr Farage said Ukip was attracting vast chunks of Labour’s traditional working-class voters as well as Tories. 

He told supporters: ‘This party is not about Left and Right, this party is about right and wrong.’ 

Tougher border controls were promised, with more officials and health checks on migrants before they are allowed to enter the UK. He also said Ukip would:

Speaking in Doncaster, where one of the local MPs is Labour leader Ed Miliband, Mr Farage said Ukip was targeting blue-collar voters as well as its traditional Right-wing supporters. 

Mr Farage lambasted the 'one party state' which exists in many towns and cities in many northern regions

Mr Farage said Labour needed to be tackled because it was too 'complacent' and had failed to protect children from sex abuse in Rotherham. He said the crimes had come about as a ‘direct result’ of Labour policies

He said the party was making major inroads into Labour support in the Midlands, the North and across Wales.

He also said Labour’s handling of the child-abuse scandal in Rotherham was ‘one of the most shocking things I have seen in my lifetime in this country’.

The main battleground for the general election would be open-door immigration, he said, warning: ‘We are borderless Britain.’

Ukip immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe detailed proposals for an Australian-style, points-based migration system and a cap of 50,000 people a year allowed in.

An extra 2,500 front-line staff would also work at ports and airports under the proposals.

Mr Woolf told the conference: ‘If the Government can find the technology to listen in on all our phone calls it must be technically possible to identify UK citizens when they return home. 

He also hit out at the proposed bombing campaign against ISIS and said it would make British streets unsafe

In his set-piece conference speech, the UKIP leader told cheering supporters at Doncaster Racecourse that the party was not only a threat to the Tories but 'to the entire British political class', adding: 'I'll drink to that'

Expensive handbags, shoes and sports cars would be subjected to a luxury goods tax under Ukip plans.

The levy, dubbed the ‘Wag tax’, would be applied to shoes costing more than £200, handbags over £1,000 and cars worth more than £50,000.

Economic spokesman Patrick O’Flynn told the party’s conference it ‘makes no sense’ that families buying cheaper goods pay the same amount of tax as those splashing out, and proposed raising VAT to 25 per cent on luxury items.

He pledged to scrap a loophole that allows visitors from outside the EU to claim back VAT on shopping sprees, and the party also heard plans to cut the tax rate from 40p to 35p for those earning between £42,000 and £55,000.

Mr Farage said the plans recognised the fall in living standards for ‘millions of people’.

‘Ukip would make this happen. It would do so by introducing priority entry points at all borders for UK passport holders. One line for British passport holders. One line for the rest of the world.’

He said the UK Borders staff were the ‘visible protectors of our nation’ and added: ‘For too long these hard-working public servants have been put under too much pressure by successive governments. 

'They need our support. So today I am announcing that, Ukip’s general election manifesto will include a provision to increase front-line staff and search teams at UK Border entry points by an 2,500 officers.’

At present there are separate lines at UK airports for non-EU and EU, including British, citizens.

Mr Farage said polls showed Ukip no longer posed a threat ‘just to the Conservative Party’.

He added: ‘In our target seats next year in the by-elections and in the general election, if you vote Ukip you will get Ukip.  

The UKIP leader also unveiled two populist policies designed to win support from ordinary voters – including a ‘Wag Tax’ on luxury goods and a British-only queue at immigration controls

Mr Farage remained rather animated throughout his speech to delegates at the UKIP annual conference

Mr Farage also told the UKIP audience that the party was no longer a threat only to the Conservative party

'If we get this right and win enough seats in what is going to be a tight general election, we could even say to people, “Vote Ukip to hold the balance of power”.

‘And if we hold the balance of power there won’t just be a referendum on our EU membership, there will be a culture change in British politics. 

'It will be a kind of politics that represents ordinary men and women.’

Mr Farage, 50, also revealed he would step down as Ukip leader within a decade and expects to be replaced by a woman.

He pledged to resign if the party gets no MPs at the election, and suggested former Tory MP Douglas Carswell could become joint leader if he wins the by-election next month in Clacton, Essex, caused by his defection in August.

Mr Farage said: ‘If we don’t get any MPs I’ll be gone by midnight the next day. I think it is more likely that Ukip will be led by a woman next than any other party.’

Mr Farage told the crowd: ‘Why are we in Doncaster? Well, it’s quite simple – because Ed Miliband is one of the town’s MPs and we want to signal to the world that we are now parking our tanks on the Labour party lawn'

The UKIP party conference at Doncaster Racecourse sold a host of speciality products, including this 'Let's Rock Politics' stick of rock 

The party poked fun at the 'Westminster clowns' running the country in Parliament, including pro-European MP Ken Clarke

Oops! Bigwig changes her tune to keep Nigel sweet 

A senior Ukip politician was forced into an embarrassing U-turn live on television yesterday after she was told by a reporter that she was contradicting Nigel Farage.

Deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, pictured, explained why she backed air strikes in Iraq in an interview on the BBC. 

But when she was told that Mr Farage was against the military action, she backtracked. 

Deputy chairman Suzanne Evans (pictured) was explaining why she backed air strikes in Iraq in an interview on the BBC when she suddenly backtracked after being told that Mr Farage was against the military action

Seconds after saying the intervention by the British was ‘important’, she then questioned if it was ‘really necessary’.

In the interview, BBC reporter Robin Brant asked Mrs Evans: ‘On the issue of the day, Nigel Farage said it’s time to “wait”. 

He does not support military action, do you agree with him on that?’ 

She replied: ‘I think he supports the air strikes and I think it’s important. This is a dangerous barbaric death cult that we’ve got here. We have to deal with it.

‘This is something now that’s affecting British people. We have to take some kind of action.’

Mr Brant interrupted her to say: ‘He said he wouldn’t support the vote for these air strikes in Parliament. He’s said that repeatedly this morning – he doesn’t support the air strikes.’

Nigel Farage received loud cheers and signs of support from the crowd at the conference in Doncaster

Mrs Evans, who will contest the Shrewsbury seat in next year’s election, responded: ‘OK fine, perhaps I haven’t caught up with that.

‘I think the interesting thing here is a question to be asked about why Britain is participating in this.

‘America is there, we’ve got the five Arab nations that are taking part as well. Is British intervention really necessary? That’s a question we need to ask.’
