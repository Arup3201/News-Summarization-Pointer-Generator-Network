The best and worst of British fashion will go on display tomorrow in a fascinating exhibition of Kays Catalogues dating back to 1920.

Archivists have gathered over 1,500 images from the firm's brochures over the last 90 years which chart the nation's changing looks.

Everything from 1940s nylon dresses to cheesy 1970s bell-bottoms are captured on the pages of the iconic mail order brochures.

The images provide a snapshot of British tastes through the years, from prim skirts in the post-War years to brassy leopard-print halterneck dresses in the late 1990s.

Belles of the Ball: The 1960 Autumn/Winter Kay's catalogue shows off 'Fashionable dresses' that promise 'grace and charm for eveningwear', showcasing the nipped-in waist that was favoured at the time

Kays originated in Worcester in 1890 selling functional workware and household items but moved into mainstream fashion in the 1920s.

The University of Worcester has amassed the vast archive of pictures for its 'World of Kays' project - which will go on display at the city's library tomorrow.

Project manager Jenni Waugh said: 'This collection is a snapshot of Britain's fashions and tastes, both good and bad, over the last century.

'Kays was always at the heart of consumer culture in this country.

'It created an image of life for working people to aspire to, allowing them to dream of what they wanted to be next.

'Some of the outfits are so outlandish and bizarre that I can't imagine anyone wearing them now but people did and with some pride.'

Alison Winston, from the unversity's research collections team said: 'Kays and Co was a very influential company throughout the 20th century, in terms of the number of local people it employed and the way it represented a shift in lifestyle during this period.

'Our archive is a great resource for showing us how life and consumer behaviour changed between 1890 and 2000.

'We would encourage anyone with an interest in changing British lifestyles to see some of these treasures.'

Kays began in 1890 in Worcester marketing fashions and household items.

Michelle Collins was the star of the 2000 Autumn/Winter catalogue in leopard print, cowboy-style tassels, and even a dog collar choker

Actress Lisa Faulkner donned neon pink adorned with rhinestones for the 2000 Spring/Summer catalogue. The skirt-over-trousers look was also popular at the time

Noel Edmonds helped design a range of very funky shirts for Kays, which were modelled with flared 'fashion pants' in the 1980 Spring/Summer catalogue

The mail-order company quickly grew and by the 20th century millions of people across Britain used the catalogue - which allowed people to pay off goods at a small rate every week - to kit out their homes and families.

In the early 1920s the catalogue advertised functional clothes including hard-wearing men's dungarees which were suitable 'for mechanics'.

The ad boasts: 'Made from specially milled solid twill blue dye dungaree. They will stand washing many times.'

Meanwhile, women's fashions changed dramatically - from the demure high-necked floral dresses which fell below the knee in the 1940s to racy bikinis popular in the 1960s.

Arguably the most embarrassing decade for fashion was the 1980s collection of Noel Edmonds' T-shirts.

Fresh-faced male models are featured sporting skin-tight £4.99 T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan 'Lazer' above a grinning picture of the bearded TV presenter.

In another double-page spread entitled 'Birds of 1970s Britain', pouting models in double-breasted jackets and fur-trimmed coats strike poses on an outdoor bandstand.

More modern, yet no less questionable fashions, include ex-EastEnders star Michelle Collins wearing an array of 
leopard-print dresses topped off with black poncho and blood-red 
lipstick for the 2000 catalogue.

Actress Pat Phoenix wearing rather demure tailored suits in the 1972 Autumn/Winter catalogue. In an age before the internet, Kays catalogue was a staple for home shoppers

Menswear by Beverley, modeled by terribly wholesome looking men in the  1970 Spring/Summer catalogue. Kays expanded throughout the 20th century with offices and warehouses throughout Britain including Leeds, Glasgow, Bradford, Bristol and York

Singer and actress Anita Harris in some very groovy clothes, including some iconic 1970s looks like the headband, flared trousers and A-line mini dresses

A fascinating 1,500 images from the catalogue's vast archive have been collated after the university secured a £55,000 grant for the project.

Project manager Ms Waugh said: "The clothes that Kay's sold were very much the mainstream take on underground fashion and culture.

'After all, it was for working people, not glamour godesses.

'It was all-encompassing - you could even buy live chickens at one point.'

In an age before the internet Kays catalogue became a staple for home shoppers ever since its first publication in 1890.

The company traces its origins back to Worcester-based Skarratt's jewellers and watchmakers in 1794.

The 1960 Spring/Summer catalogue sees the over-the-knee, full-skirted dress so synonymous with the 60s housewife, advertised in a range of bold colours and patterns

In the early 1920s the catalogue advertised functional clothes including hard-wearing men's dungarees which were suitable 'for mechanics' which 'will stand washing many times'

Owner John Skarratt's grandson took over the business and employed William Kay in the early 1870s.

Kay eventually left the business and set up his own company in 1890 called 'Kays of Worcester'.

Aided by two clerks and an errand boy, his firm was a strict 'cash with order' business, selling products to customers who subscribed to Kays catalogue.

Kays expanded throughout the 20th century with offices and warehouses throughout Britain including Leeds, Glasgow, Bradford, Bristol and York.It became Worcester's biggest employer until it relocated to Liverpool in 2007.

Retail giant Littlewoods merged with Kays in 2004 and it was renamed K&Co.

The project was funded by a £55,500 grant from JISC, an organisation which inspires UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies.

A companion website was launched in 2011 containing hundreds of images from the past.
