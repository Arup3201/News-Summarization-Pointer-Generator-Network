Angry: Neil Dugdale (pictured wearing an Aston Villa FC shirt), of Felixstowe, threatened to 'slit the throat' of his friend, Ipswich Crown Court was told

A computer games fan threatened to ‘slit the throat’ of his friend because he stopped playing Grand Theft Auto with him, a court has heard.

Neil Dugdale, 31, became angry after Adam French, 22, allegedly left a gaming session without telling him, so stormed over to his house in Felixstowe, Suffolk, clutching a knife and claw-hammer - and threatened to ‘slit his throat’.

The pair used to regularly play multiplayer via the internet on the violent gangster game as they sat in their own homes a few doors apart.

Last month Dugdale admitted two counts of possessing an offensive weapon, criminal damage, affray and resisting arrest.

At his sentencing at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday, Judge John Holt said he wanted a report on Dugdale’s psychiatric condition before he decided whether to jail him.

The court heard how Dugdale had consumed four litres of cider, cannabis and anti-depressants when the incident occurred at 5.30pm on March 14.

Charles Falk, prosecuting, said: ‘Grand Theft Auto is a game where you drive around taking cars, fighting and killing people.’

Computer game: Grand Theft Auto involves players earning points for carrying out a series of assaults, carjackings and murders including drive-by shootings.

He said Mr French was at home when Dugdale arrived outside his address. Dugdale shouted: ‘I’m going to slit your throat - I’m going to f****** kill you.’

At the time Dugdale was holding a large red-handled kitchen knife and swinging a claw hammer around.

He was stabbing the knife in the top of the garden fence while shouting at Mr French to come down.

When Mr French’s sister came out, Dugdale smashed the front passenger window of her Renault Clio with the hammer.

Claims: The game has been repeatedly criticised for allegedly encouraging violent behaviour and has been blamed for murders in the US and Thailand

At an earlier hearing Mark Holt, defending, said Dugdale denied that he and Mr French had been playing Grand Theft Auto.

'I’m going to slit your throat - I’m going to f****** kill you'

What Neil Dugdale shouted

Dugdale claimed he had become angry because he had twice confided in Mr French only for his confidences to have been betrayed.

Grand Theft Auto involves players earning points for carrying out a series of assaults, carjackings and murders including drive-by shootings.

The game has been repeatedly criticised for allegedly encouraging violent behaviour and has been blamed for murders in the US and Thailand.
