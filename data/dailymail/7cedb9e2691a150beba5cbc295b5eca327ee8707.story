A British dance instructor turned U.S. TV host who was allegedly shot dead last week by his son-in-law and former lover is now being investigated for sex crimes against young boys.

Scott Rogers, 52, who was originally from Suffolk, is believed to have been killed at his Baton Rouge home in Louisiana, by Mathew Hodgkinson who then shot himself in a failed suicide bid.

Now officers are thought to be looking into claims that Rogers is responsible for a string of sexual assaults against young boys going back to the last millennium during his time in England.

Police are looking into claims that Scott Rogers, 52, who was shot dead at his home in Louisiana last week, sexually abused children while working at a 'cult-like' dance school in the UK

Rogers was well-known in Baton Rouge as the host of feel-good show Around Town, which aired on Saturday and Sunday mornings.

Suffolk County Council and Suffolk Police were made aware of the claims before Mr Rogers's death and are assisting inquiries in the US.

Today a Suffolk Police spokesman said: 'There were no UK police investigations ongoing into Scott Rogers prior to his death.

'Suffolk Police has so far received a handful of calls from people who have made initial allegations that they were sexually abused by him.

'Detectives will make further contact with these individuals in the next few days to ascertain whether they wish to disclose further information.'  

Mathew Hodgkinson, 36, is believed to have shot Rogers before turning the gun on himself in a failed murder-suicide bid

Scott Rogers, who was known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds in 1983.

But the school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council in 1995, and they warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their children there.

According to the Bury Free Press, Rogers was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993.

Parents also told the paper about 'sleepovers' Rogers would have with some of his young students, during which he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags.'

In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993.

In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult' .

It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.'

At the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts. Some of our pupils have moved on to appear in the West End theatre and on television.

'People are still coming here for classes from all over Suffolk. We are not involved in any cult activities and to say we are is ridiculous.'

Hodgkinson is married to Rogers' daughter, Kimmy, who was also thought to be in the house when the shooting took place last week (pictured, a note found after the shooting)

Meanwhile police say Hodgkinson is still in a coma in Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Baton Rouge after surviving the alleged murder-suicide attempt.

Mr Hodgkinson, 36, who was also British, was married to Mr Rogers' daughter Kimmy, and it has been suggested that all three lived in the home where Mr Rogers was shot.

A suspected suicide note believed to be written by Hodgkinson was found in Rogers’ home.

‘They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too,’ read the note. 

Any victims or witnesses of alleged sexual abuse should contact Suffolk Police on 101.
