As one of the world's most famous footballers, Cristiano Ronaldo is used to making TV appearances. 

But the 29-year-old would have experienced few as strange as his appearance on Japanese screens this week.

Ronaldo was apparently on the show to promote some fitness products and discuss how he maintains his impressive physique.

Ronaldo has been in Japan after being unveiled as the new face of healthcare brand MTG. The Ballon D'Or winner also spent time at a children's football clinic in Nagoya.

Portugal’s captain also got stuck into the country’s cultural customs and was pictured attending a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. 'I think Japan is a fantastic country, fantastic people,' he said. 'I had the opportunity to be here before and I know the fans here. They are amazing.'

But judging by Ronaldo's reaction, the world's best player may not be seen on Japanese TV for some time.
