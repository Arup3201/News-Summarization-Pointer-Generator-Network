She recently lost more than three stone and slimmed down from a curvy size 16 to a svelte size eight.

And Geordie Shore's Charlotte Crosby is clearly keen to showcase the fruits of her labour as she models her new fashion range for e-tailer In The Style.

The 24-year-old, who has seen her fitness DVD become the biggest-selling in the last 15 years, told FEMAIL that her weight loss was the main inspiration behind her new Nostalgia range.

Charlotte Crosby, who found fame on Geordie Shore, has unveiled her SS15 Nostalgia range for In The Style - and shows off her svelte new figure in the campaign imagery (dress, £32.99)

She said: 'It allowed me to include tighter, sexier styles.

But I've kept styles for different body shapes, too. I'll always love casual styles so we have a great mix now.'

The spring/summer 2015 collection, which is priced between £16 and £46, comes after the Charlotte smashed records for the brand, with some items selling out in less than ten minutes after going live.

Some pieces have been restocked over ten times due to huge demand.

Charlotte, who is heading to Australia to launch her range there, explained how her collection of layered shift dresses, pastel playsuits, slogan T-shirts and floral bodycons has evolved.

'We've definitely continued designing what people loved from the last range but we've also experimented with more styles this time,' she said. 

'This range is sexier and some of the styles we've designed for going out are more daring than I ever used to wear.'

She explains she has added plenty of sexier styles that she couldn't necessarily wear before she lost weight

Charlotte who loves 'nothing more than throwing on one of her oversized vests or slogan tees' has included casual items (slogan tees, £17.99)

Charlotte admits that it would be 'amazing' to see Cheryl Fernandez-Versini wearing the range (dress, £35.99)

The range perfectly encapsulates Charlotte's personal style. The reality star, who loves 'nothing more than throwing on one of her over-sized vests or slogan tees' has included casual items, as well as the party dresses she loves to wear on a night out in Newcastle.

Charlotte, who cites Vanessa Hudgens as her style icon, has her sights set on one celebrity client in particular.

'It would be amazing to see Cheryl Fernandez-Versini wearing the range,' she said.

'So many celebrities wore the last range and it's always a buzz to see people in something I've had so much input into. I also love seeing my Twitter feed of people wearing them - it's always a great feeling.' 

The star, who wants her brand to 'take over the high street', is already plotting the future. So where does she see herself in five years time? 

'Ruler of the world?,' she jokes. 'Pregnant and designing a nostalgia maternity range!'.
