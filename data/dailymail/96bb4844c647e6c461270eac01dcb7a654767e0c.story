A newborn  baby girl has been found safe and well after she was kidnapped from her hospital bassinet while her mother was taking a shower.

After a desperate search, little Nadine Pretorius was found in a unit in Auckland, New Zealand, where the couple who are alleged to have taken her had set up two cots in a bedroom. 

The drama began on Thursday when Elsje Pretorius took a shower at Middlemore Hospital, in Manukau City, Auckland, five days after giving birth. 

But to her horror, baby Nadine was no longer in her cot when she got out of the shower at 8pm on Thursday September 25, according to stuff.co.nz. 

She said when the evening nurse came in to introduce herself Mrs Pretorius asked if she had taken her baby girl.

'We were both panicking,' Ms Pretorius recounted the moments she and the nurse alerted security of her baby's kidnapping.

According to a nurse at the hospital, a woman was seen lingering outside Mrs Pretorius' room. 

'She must have been waiting for the right time,' Mrs Pretorius said. 

CCTV footage revealed a man and woman carrying the baby away while Mrs Pretorius was showering. 

Police said the pair sneaked through as a family was leaving the locked hospital ward.

But instead of feeling distressed while viewing the hospital's footage, Mrs Pretorius said she felt comfort watching the two lovingly handle her new born.

During their investigations, police discovered a pregnant 26-year-old moved out into a new flat, where police reportedly discovered the two bassinets. 

On September 13, two weeks before the kidnapping, the woman supposedly sent a text message alerting landlord she was in hospital having twins by caesarean. The fate of the children is unknown.

On Friday the woman appeared in the Manukau District Court on Friday and remains in custody with an interim name suppression while her mental health is evaluated. A 31 year old man was bailed. Neither have entered a plea.

In the morning after the kidnapping, Mrs Pretorius was woken up after being sedated by hospital staff with good news from her husband, Colin, who said baby Nadine had been found.

She said she still has no clue why this happened but holds no hard feelings towards the accused.

'Nadine was totally content. I could see the colour in her cheeks was good. She'd been eating and sleeping,' Mrs Pretorius said.
