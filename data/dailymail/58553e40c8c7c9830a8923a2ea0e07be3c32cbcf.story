Built by a grieving emperor in memory of his wife, India's breathtaking Taj Mahal is famously regarded as the ultimate declaration of love.

It may be a lot smaller, but any woman who received this lavish 3.5ft high replica of the real thing from the man in her life would still consider it a pretty extravagant romantic gesture.

The intricate model will feature 20kg of gold, 400kg of silver, and eight diamonds, and the 'Taj-obsessed' jeweller behind the ambitious project is hoping to sell it for at least £11.5million.

Lavish: The replica of the Taj Mahal, which is being built in Bhopal, India, features 420kg of precious metals and eight diamonds

A team of 35 skilled workmen in Bhopal, India, have already spent more than a year and a half recreating the splendour of the Agra landmark in miniature; from the iconic golden dome to the Arabic calligraphy inscribed on the doors.

The main dome on the model - which features 25 domes in total - has been made from gold, while 20,000 silver tiles have been laid on the floor of the replica.

All 32 doors have been cast in gold and 
an Islamic scholar was brought in to ensure that the Koran passages that
decorate the 16th century Taj Mahal are reproduced exactly.

Three different types of stones were used to decorate the Taj Mahal: semi-precious stones such as onyx, jade and bloody stone; rare and scarce stones such as goldstone and magnet stone, and common stones such as sandstone and black slate.

As soon as one enters one can see the central 
chamber of the building beneath the main dome held the cenotaph of the 
queen. Four octagonal rooms on each story flank the four rooms. 
Altogether 16 rooms (eight on each level) surround the central 
chamber. These rooms were to be used to bury other members of the royal 
family. 

Like the exterior the interior too is a building faced with white marble
but with much elaborated carvings and decoration. A masterpiece inside 
the Taj is an exquisitely developed marble jali screen (called 
Jhajjhari) that surrounds the graves. The inlay work on its borders and 
the graceful jalies are one the highs of medieval architecture.

As dictated by ancient Islamic tradition, the crypts of Emperor and 
Empress lie side by side with their faces towards Mecca and their feet 
toward the south with the husband on his spouse right The crypts are 
decorated beautifully with inscriptions from the holy book Qu'ran and 
once were studded with semi-precious stones and gems.

The man behind the 
project, jeweller Syed Hanif, said he has been obsessed with the Taj 
Mahal ever since he first laid eyes on the building 22 years ago.

'I
saw the Taj Mahal for the first time when I was an ordinary worker 
earning 100 rupees (£11) a month,' said Mr Hanif, who is now managing 
director of jewellery firm Star Gems.

'Ever since then I have been obsessed with recreating its grandeur in gold.'

The 50-year-old jeweller, who has christened the project Taj 2012, sent every member of his team to view the spectacular building in person.

'We took thousands of photographs of the Taj Mahal to make the blueprints, so that we could have the exact details,' said Mr Hanif, who admitted he has spent a fortune on the lavish model.

'I also sent every workman to see the Taj Mahal personally so they could understand it.'

Mr Hanif said he hopes to sell the Taj 2012 at auction when it is completed by the end of this year.

The replica measures 3.5ft tall and 5.5ft across. Its specially made wooden stand alone is worth a million rupees - or £11,000.

'The Taj 2012 has cost me a fortune but I will be selling it for at least 100 crores rupees (£11.5million), Mr Hanif said.

The
real Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jehan in the 16th 
century in memory of his third wife Mumtaz, who had died giving birth to
the couple's 14th child.

It took 22 years to build and cost the equivalent of 32 million Indian rupees.

'Fortune': Mr Hanif, seen with his replica Taj Mahal with an image of the real thing behind, is hoping the model will attract interest from international buyers
