From plank hats to frilly hotpants, London's leading platform for men's fashion is no stranger to the bizarre ensemble. But designer Astrid Andersen took things a step further when she sent models down the catwalk in neoprene mankinis.

The unusual two-pieces were joined by billowing printed capes in an array of zany hues, flowing silk board shorts, crop tops and even, for one poor model, a fringed bodycon dress.

Others sported strapless dresses, cut just below the nipple, which came in bright fluorescent pink, high viz orange, subtle black and a pretty shade of cobalt blue.

Sporty: A model in a sheer mesh top and cycling shorts, and a cropped jacket on the catwalk

And Anderson wasn't the only one bent on raising eyebrows. At Hentsch Man, models sporting candy stripes and summer brights chomped on cigars as they posed on the catwalk during the presentation.

Then, at Lou Dalton, a distinctly feminine palette took centre stage with cleverly cut jackets in coral teamed with shorts that finished just above the knee, and a delicate pale pink parachute silk blouse.

Equally quirky were the offerings at MAN, a show designed to showcase the best of London's up-and-coming creative talent, where wacky masks, a skin-tight all-in-one and a Mounties costume all took centre stage.

Luckily for the models at London Collection: Men, which opened in the capital today, not every designer was bent on making headlines for all the wrong reasons.

Also on the runway today were pieces by Topman, where creative director Gordon Richardson took an more tailored approach to menswear, showing beautifully cut suits in delicate summer pastels.

Puffing away: Despite the cigars, there were plenty of fabulous pieces to be found during the Hentsch Man presentation at London Collections: Men

In the pink: Lou Dalton showed a collection dominated by salmon pink and coral hues

Unconventional: An ensemble by newcomer Nicomede Talavera on the runway

Pared back: Dalton also included a pared back shell pink blouse in her menswear collection

Eau de nil, sugared violet, cornflower 
blue and palest apricot: all were present and correct, with Richardson 
even managing to make them look masculine, courtesy of mod sunglasses 
and foppish Paul Weller style haircuts.

Happily for those not yet ready to be prised away from their black, Richardson followed up with wideboy suits in charcoal and black, teamed with chunky knits emblazoned with zig-zags, and wearable black and grey striped Henleys.

There was one less than sharp addition however. Watched by a starry front row that included Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw, model Jourdan Dunn and fellow clothes horse Oliver Cheshire, every look was accessorised with bright white trainers.

It was a rare dose of sportiness in what was otherwise a collection aimed wholly at the dapper gent, who is certainly not the sort of chap who would shop at Superdry - the big name brand which got London Collections: Men off to a star-studded start last night.

Here, sports-casual dominated with khaki board shorts and scruffy-cool camouflage vests taking to the runway in front of a dapper crowd that included actor Jesse Metcalfe and model David Gandy.

Sharp: Along with pastel suits, Gordon Richardson's collection for Topman was heavy on the graphic print and tailored trousers
