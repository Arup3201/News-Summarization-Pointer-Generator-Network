Andre Schurrle stepped out in the snow on Tuesday morning as he trained  for the first time following his big-money move from Chelsea to Wolfsburg.

The Germany international completed the £24million switch on transfer deadline day after putting pen to paper on a four-year contract believed to be worth £85,000 a week.

And the World Cup winner was given no time to reflect on the day before as he was put through his paces in the freezing conditions.

There were fears that Schurrle's move would not go through before the German transfer window shut at 5pm UK time but Wolsburg got the deal over the line.

A tweet from the Bundesliga club confirmed the move, saying: 'Finally - pen has been put to paper! @Andre-Schuerrle makes the move from Chelsea to the Wolves. Contract until 2019.'

Schurrle quickly changed his Twitter biography to 'VFL Wolfsburg' and the move paved the way for Chelsea to wrap up the £27m signing of Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina before the window closed.

Cuadrado, one of the standout players at last summer's World Cup, was at Stamford Bridge on Saturday for the 1-1 draw with Manchester City, while the move saw Mohamed Salah move the other way on loan.

The two clubs had been stuck in talks over a solidarity payment owed to club's in Schurrle's development, with neither wanting to pay five per cent of the transfer fee. 

It is still unclear how the disagreement has been resolved.   

Schurrle needed to beat a noon deadline to be registered on the German FA's transfer list before potentially completing a switch. That was done under an hour beforehand as the move went down to the wire.

Earlier in the day, Wolfsburg general manager Klaus Allofs had cast doubt on the deal saying: 'Chelsea agreed to putting him on the transfer list just before midday and you can read into that what you want.' 

Cuadrado took to social media to post a message thanking Fiorentina and their fans
