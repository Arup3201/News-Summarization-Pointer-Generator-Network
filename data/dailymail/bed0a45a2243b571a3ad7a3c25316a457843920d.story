Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' wife has left a scathing one-star Amazon review for a new book about her husband.

Brad Stone's The Everything Store was published early last week to critical acclaim, but MacKenzie Bezos disagrees with the praise.

She slams the book for inaccuracies, 'techniques that stretch the boundaries of non-fiction' and 'unbalanced reporting.'

According to the Los Angeles Times, Amazon has confirmed that the review was indeed written by MacKenzie Bezos, who makes the disclosure early in her 900-word review that she has been married to the Amazon billionaire for 20 years.

For Mrs Bezos, who is a novelist, the problems begin in chapter one.

Stone writes that 20 years ago, when Bezos made the decision to leave his job and create an online bookstore, he was reading Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, in which an old man looks back on his personal and professional life choices.

Mrs Bezos says that in fact, Jeff Bezos did not read the novel until a year after he started the company.

Her other complaints are more serious: Opinions that don't fit into the narrative Stone wants to tell, she claims, are dismissed.

'For example, when the author does include people whose accounts of a supportive and inspiring culture contradict his thesis, he refers to them dismissively throughout the book as robots,' MacKenzie Bezos writes.

She includes examples of positive letters and emails her husband has received from staff over the years to redress the imbalanced impression she feels Stone leaves of her husband.

She also cautions readers to beware of techniques that purport to reveal Jeff Bezos's motives.

'... the book passes off speculation 
about his thoughts and intentions as fact. "Bezos felt…" "Bezos 
believed…" "Bezos wanted…" "Bezos fixated…" "Bezos worried…" "Bezos was 
frustrated…" "Bezos was consumed…" "In the circuitry of Bezos’s brain, 
something flipped…" When reading phrases like these, which are used in 
the book routinely, readers should remember that Jeff was never 
interviewed for this book...' she writes.

In response, Brad Stone has said that he will happily correct any mistakes in his work.

'I talked to 300 people to get a 
picture of one of the most interesting and secretive companies around,' 
Stone said in an interview with USA TODAY. 'I stand by my book. To the extent that I made mistakes I will gladly fix them.'

Jeff Bezos reportedly declined to participate in fact-checking of the book and was not interviewed for it.

'While Jeff didn't give me interviews specifically for the book,' Stone told New York Magazine, 'I drew on my discussions with him for the past decade.'

According to  TechCrunch,
Amazon was a pioneer in customer reviews and was one of the first 
companies to allow negative reviews of the products they sold to appear 
along with the listing.

So 
far Mrs Bezos's appraisal is the only one-star review on Amazon's review
page. Five-star reviews outstrip all other categories, with 31. There 
are also 10 four-star reviews and two three-star reviews.

Two other people well-acquainted with Jeff Bezos have also availed themselves of Amazon's review facility.

Jonathan Leblang, director of Amazon’s Lab126, and former Amazon executive Rick Dalzell gave mostly positive reviews of Stone's work.

Leblang gave The Everything Store four out of five stars, and Dalzell gave it three.

Stone told New York Magazine that while he wasn't pleased to see a one-star review of his book, he feels his account is a much more accurate representation of Bezos and Amazon than what MacKenzie Bezos believes.

'I can assume I’m less biased than Jeff Bezos’s wife,' he said.
