A car mechanic spent his life savings to build his own private plane only for the propeller to be damaged on its maiden flight.

Li Shilong quit his job and returned to his hometown of Xiangshui, eastern China's Jiangsu Province, to pursue his dream of building his own the plane.

According to the People's Daily News, the 26-year-old spent his entire life savings - 100,000 Yuan (£10,000) - on the project.

The plane enthusiast said he decided to have a go at a home-mad plane after seeing other people do it on television.

He said: 'I saw news of others making planes at home, and think I can also do it.'

Li, who worked as a car mechanic for more than 10 years, left his job in October last year to pursue the project.

Measuring 7.3m long and 10.5m wide, the project was completed in just three months.

However, on a test flight in Yancheng yesterday, the propeller was damaged, according to ecsn.com.

But Li is not deterred and plans to purchase new parts to realize his 'airplane dreams'.
