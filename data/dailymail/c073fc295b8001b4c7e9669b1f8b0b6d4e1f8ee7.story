These road safety signs on a remote Himalayan mountain road have driven tourists to hysterics - and may have saved their lives.

The signs on the Leh-Manili Highway, a 298-mile road with frequent plunging drops and landslide risks, include 'be gentle on my curves' and 'if you want to donate blood, don't do it on the road'.

Winding between the Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh regions in India, it gained traction with drivers by declaring 'speed thrills but often kills' and 'driving faster can cause disaster'.

Poetry in motion: The signs are on a mountain pass between the Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh regions

This isn't a car chase! These signs have amused drivers on the 298-mile Leh-Manili Highway in India

Catchy: The signs were built by the Indian army to keep the road safe for the 18 weeks a year it is passable

Beautiful: But the road is a death trap, several thousand feet above sea level inducing altitude sickness

Simple message: Sherap Sherpa (pictured), from Kathmandu, has spent six years photographing the signs

But the light-hearted tone of the signs belies their seriousness.

The arid road is thought to be one of the most dangerous in the world and drivers have been killed after experiencing lapses in concentration caused by altitude sickness.

Sherap Sherpa, 42, has spent the last six years photographing the unusual road signs.

He said: 'A few years ago I saw my first funny road sign. It said, "after drinking whiskey, driving is risky".

'I thought it was hilarious so I posted it on my Facebook. Within an hour it was shared by more than 20 friends and liked by more than 100 people.

'This inspired me to continue to photograph and share them.'

Blood bank: Drivers on the road have reportedly blacked out after being overcome by altitude sickness

Live longer: The signs all convey a positive message - though they could of course be distracting themselves

Gently does it: Mr Sherpa said his favourite sign after six years was 'drive like hell, you will be there'

The Ladakh-Manali highway is only open for 18 weeks during the summer, because snow makes the route impassable for the rest of the year.

The comical road signs were erected by the Border Roads Organisation of the Indian Army.

Mr Sherpa, from Kathmandu, said his favourite sign reads, 'drive like hell, you will be there.'

He said: 'I have many favourites, but I think that one has a strong message.'

Mr Sherpa, who documents the bizarre road signs on his website ladakhroadsigns.com, said he doubts the effectiveness of the messages.

Logic: It's impossible to fault the simple thinking behind the signs, along a landslide-threatened blackspot

Driven to hysterics: The photos quickly gained traction on Facebook and have been seen worldwide

Plane and simple: One of the witty signs reminds drivers that 'this is a highway, not a runway'

He said: 'I'm not sure if they help with road safety. Most local truck drivers can't read English. Those who can just laugh at the humour in the language.'

So far Mr Sherpa, a tour guide, has photographed more than 130 of the humourous road signs.

Pankaj Batra, 31, from Gurgaon, India, who has also driven down the road, said: 'These signs are funny yet meaningful. On difficult drives, they ease your pain.

'On this quiet and very risky route, these signs bring smiles to drivers' faces and help to ease their tension.'

Mr Sherpa said: 'Most local truck drivers can't read English. Those who can just laugh at the humour'

Poignant: The funny tone of the signs belies a serious message on one of the world's most hazardous roads

Stark: The Border Roads Organisation is famous for signs elsewhere, such as this one in Sikkim, Himalayas
