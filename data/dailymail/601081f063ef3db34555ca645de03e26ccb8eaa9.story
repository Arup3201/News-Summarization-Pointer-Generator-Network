Three members of the same family were killed when the driver of their car swerved to avoid a deer and slewed off the road before crashing into a tree.

The relatives were on a family trip to celebrate the recent wedding of Sarah and Andrew Pain and had enjoyed a punting trip and dinner out before the tragic smash happened on the A4074 in Oxfordshire.

Mrs Pain, 29, and her sister Angela Hughes-Brooks, 37, lost both their husbands and their father when the Mercedes driven by Mr Pain, 31, flew off the road and hit two trees.  Mrs Pain and Mrs Hughes-Brooks survived the crash.

A coroner heard that the men died on 
June 4 this year at the end of a happy family day out to celebrate the 
Pains' recent wedding in the US.

They were driving home that evening when the deer appeared in front of the car.  Mr Pain swerved to avoid it and the Mercedes saloon, which he had borrowed from his parents, slid sideways off the road and hit two trees at around 60mph.

Financial analyst Andrew, 31, graphic designer Greg Brooks, 39, and the two women’s father, Stephen Hughes, a 57-year-old lawyer, were declared dead at the scene.

The Oxfordshire coroner heard how Mr Pain and his new American wife, who lived in London, had thrown a wedding celebration party at his parents’ home in Oxfordshire on 2 June for friends who couldn’t travel to their wedding in Baltimore, USA, 10 weeks earlier.

On June 4, family members had enjoyed a countryside picnic at idyllic Cherwell House before going hunting and then out for a meal at an Indian restaurant in Oxford.

However, tragedy struck on the journey home as darkness fell around 9.45pm.

In a statement read out on her behalf,
Mrs Pain said: 'The atmosphere in the car was good. It had been a good 
day and we were all talking.

'I
remember seeing a deer - it wasn’t a large deer, it was a small deer. 
When we came around the bend, it was there in the headlights.

'All I can visualise is that deer, I don’t know what happened after that.'

The inquest heard how Mr Pain, who was sober, 'violently snatched' to the left to avoid the animal in the road.

The
blue Mercedes E230 saloon flew
off the road at around 60mph and hit two trees, killing the three men 
instantly.

Mrs Pain’s sister Angela, of Maryland, USA, who was in the front passenger seat, clambered out of the vehicle covered in blood and, despite having broken wrists herself, flagged down a coach driver who immediately called 999.

In a statement, she said: 'Andy was driving. I was in the front passenger seat because I get car sickness.

'Andy’s driving was careful and safe. We were on the way back to Andy’s parents’ house. The vehicle’s headlights were on and the stereo was off because we were talking.

'Suddenly, a deer jumped out in to the road. This deer was not a fully grown deer, but it was not a baby either. Andy swerved to avoid hitting it and I don’t remember what happened after that.'

Firefighters had to cut Mrs Pain out of her middle seat in the rear of the car. The bodies of the three dead men were also cut from the vehicle.

The inquest heard Mr Hughes and Mr Brooks were not wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash. But collision investigator Stephen Moffatt told the hearing it was unlikely they would have survived even if they had been belted in.

'It’s difficult to overestimate the violence of this collision,' he said.

'When a vehicle strikes a mature tree at this kind of speed, you cannot begin to imagine the noise, the distortion to the vehicle shell, the chaos that occurs inside the vehicle. It’s very lucky, in my opinion, that we have two survivors from this collision.'

Mr Moffatt said tyre marks suggested Andrew 'snatched violently' to the left.

He added: 'It’s one of those manoeuvres you couldn’t bring yourself to do unless you knew your life was in danger.

'These are instantaneous, knee-jerk reactions using his experience as a driver. It’s over in seconds.'

Toxicology tests confirmed none of the men had alcohol or drugs in their systems.

Oxford coroner Darren Salter recorded three verdicts of accidental death.

Addressing the relatives, he said: 'I would like to pass on my sympathies to you all as a family. This is a case which, in many ways, is unimaginable.

'This was the tragic loss of three lives from the same family on a return trip from a happy family day out. I once again pass on my condolences to you as a family.'
