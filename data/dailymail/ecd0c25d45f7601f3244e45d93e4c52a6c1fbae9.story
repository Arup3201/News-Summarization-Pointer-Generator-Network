Democrats' hopes of retaining the Senate and winning back the House are looking bleaker and bleaker these days as national polls foretell disaster for the president's party in next month's elections.

One particularly crushing blow to Democrats' chances is an ABC News/Washington Post poll released this morning that puts the party's popularity level at its lowest point in 30 years and Obama's approval rating at a career low.

Worse, significantly more likely voters who took the poll said they would cast a ballot against Obama on Election Day, 26 percent, than those who said they would vote to show their support for him, 14 percent.

President Barack Obama speaks about the effort to destroy ISIS at a meeting with the military leadership from 21 coalition partner nations on Tuesday. Despite Obama's efforts to convince Americans that he has the situation under control, likely voters overwhelming said they trusted Republicans to finish off the terrorist group than Democrats

President Barack Obama's approval rating is at a career low. Worse, just 33 percent of voters not affiliated with either major party gave Obama high praise. That spells bad news for Democrats in November

The release of the poll spelling doom for Democrats was coupled by a report from Politico that President Barack Obama will limit his campaigning the week before the election to states with competitive gubernatorial races.

The move by the White House could signal a shift in focus away from winning control of Congress. It may also be evidence of just how unwelcome the president is at events with House and Senate candidates from his own political party.

The newly released ABC News poll found that Obama is viewed favorably by just 40 percent of Americans.

More telling is that voters who say they're not aligned with either major party gave Obama a 33 percent approval rating.

Respondents to the poll also gave Obama historically low ratings for his handling of immigration, international affairs and terrorism. 

Furthermore, seven out 10 survey takers said they fear that terrorists will carry out another attack on the U.S, and likely voters gave Republicans a 22 point advantage when it came to who they trust most to defeat ISIS.

The only major issues that presumed voters said they believed Democrats were best equipped to tackle were 'helping the middle class' and 'women's issues. Democrats carried the women's issues category by 22 points, suggesting that the GOP is still battling the notion that it's at war with women.

And while Republicans are even less liked by voters than Democrats and have a 33 percent positive rating compared to Democrats' 39 percent, ABC's pollsters found that GOP congressional candidates have a significant lead over their opponents.

Republican contenders for the House of Representatives hold a 50-43 percent lead over their Democratic competitors among likely voters, the survey shows.

Congressional Democrats hoping to close the gap in the final weeks of the race were confronted with even more bad news today as their party chair revealed that weak spending from outside groups could cost them as many as three dozen seats.

'Look, it’s more of a challenge than we would like it to be,' Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel told reporters today during a briefing. 

'It is frustrating that the cavalry that has always been there don’t seem to be there,' the New York representative said, according to Politico.

First lady Michelle Obama is pictured here at a campaign rally for for Pennsylvania Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf this afternoon. The White House has turned its focus to helping members of the president's party competing for their states' executive mansions as national Democrats appear less and less likely to win the Senate. They have almost no hope of winning the House

Already, Democrats have a 17-seat deficit in the House of Representatives. Republicans are predicted to expand their dominance in the lower chamber by at least five seats, if not more. 

The GOP hopes to win at least 11 additional seats this election cycle in order to achieve an overwhelming majority not seen by Republicans in the House since the '40s. 

Polling site Real Clear Politics ranks 17 seats as toss ups and predicts that two seats currently held by Republican lawmakers will go to Democrats. RCP lists just one district represented by a Democrat as a probable Republican pick-up opportunity.

That means Republicans would have to win 15 of the 17 toss-up races listed by Real Clear Politics in order to achieve it's goal, an unlikely scenario.

Israel said today that he doesn't believe any of the seats Democrats are fighting to the finish for are a lost cause yet, but the trickle of spending from Democratic political action committees suggests that other major players in his party think otherwise.

The 2014 elections were always Republicans to lose, as Democrats traditionally turn out in low numbers in midterm years. Voters also tend to support the party who's guy is not in the executive seat of power during midterm elections, as well.

The dynamics of the midterm elections, combined with president's poor approval rating, have given Republicans the upper hand in the Senate, too.

While RCP has Republicans and Democrats neck and neck for control of the legislature's upper chamber, only two of the seats on the site's toss-up list are currently held by Republicans. The other eight belong to Democratic lawmakers.

As such, President Obama has reportedly set his sights on the country's governors races, which Democrats have a substantially stronger chance of winning, and will campaign for candidates in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Maine and Michigan, according to a White House official who spoke with Politico.

This upcoming weekend he'll also appear at events with Democratic candidates for governor in Maryland and Illinois. 

Obama was supposed to headline an event for Connecticut's governor today, but the White House announced at the last minute that the president, who is notorious for campaigning in the midst of crises, would stay in Washington to focus on the government's response to the Ebola outbreak.

Last night news broke that a second hospital worker at the Texas facility where Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan was treated had contracted Ebola. Duncan met an untimely death last Wednesday after doctors unsuccessfully treated him for the deadly disease.

Nearly two-thirds of respondents to ABC News' poll, which was conducted from the day after Duncan died until Sunday, said they're worried about an Ebola epidemic in the U.S. The poll does not appear to have asked them how they feel about Obama's response to the emergency so far.
