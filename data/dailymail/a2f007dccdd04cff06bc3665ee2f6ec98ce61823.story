Lord Nelson's famous warship HMS Victory may have been painted the wrong colour after historians examining the ship found no evidence of the well known 'bumblebee' design in its original paintwork.

Hundreds of fragments of the ship's original paint have been studied, with experts concluding that the hull was mostly black with varnished timber - not the pale orange and black design adorning the ship in a Portsmouth drydock today.

The paint analysis may lead to HMS Victory being repainted in its traditional colours, and casts doubt on the legend that the current design was introduced on Lord Nelson's orders during an 1803 refit.

Experts at the University of Lincoln's conservation institute described the current design as a 'hideous orange' that was brought in about 100 years after the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar.

By that point HMS Victory had become a symbol of Britain's naval strength, and it is thought the bumblebee pattern was added during a renovation to give Nelson's flagship a more distinctive look.

'What you see today is largely an early 20th century invention of what an 18th century warship looked like,' the institute's founder Michael Crick-Smith told The Times - adding that the team's work was inspired by a item on the Antiques Roadshow.

Mr Crick-Smith's team were able to peel back 72 layers of paint one-by-one to by the reveal the ship's changing decoration since it was first launched on May 7, 1765.

According to the research, the ship was originally a simple black and vanished wood design when it first saw action at the Battles of Ushant in 1778 and 1781, the Siege of Gibraltor in 1782 and the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797.

Is this really how it was? HMS Victory was depicted with two-tone paintwork in this painting of the Battle of Trafalgar by Turner from 1822 - 17 years after the event

Later in 1797, HMS Victory was 
declared unfit for service as a warship and was converted to a hospital 
ship to hold wounded prisioners of war.

Within
 two years the ship returned to war service and, by the time Lord Nelson
 hoisted his flag in Victory on 18 May 1803, it had been painted a light
 shade of ochre - a kind of pale, rust colour.

The research also suggests HMS Victory's deck - on which Lord Nelson was shot and killed by a French sniper during the Battle of Trafalgar - was a pale cream colour, not the bare wood often depicted in classical paintings.

Meanwhile cabins on the ship, including the one belonging to Lord Nelson, are thought to have been much plainer than they look today.

'These were working spaces, not country houses at sea as they appear now,' Mr Crick-Smith said.

Although it had been in service for 40 years by the time, HMS Victory's most famous moment came during the Battle of Trafalgar, when it was used as Lord Nelson's flagship.

During the battle, Victory led 27 British ships to triumph over 33 from the French and Spanish navy. The Franco-Spanish fleet lost twenty-two ships, without a single British vessel being lost.

The battle was seen as confirmation of Britain's naval supremacy - in part due to Nelson's unorthodox tactics.

He went against traditional naval convention and divided his smaller force into two columns directed perpendicularly against the larger enemy fleet.

The result was a decisive British victory, with the commander of the joint French and Spanish forces, Admiral Villeneuve, captured along with his ship Bucentaure.

The battle is widely seen as Britain's greatest naval victory, but during the action Nelson was fatally wounded by a French sniper on the deck of HMS Victory.

His body was brought back to England where he was given a state funeral.

Nelson's death secured his position as one of Britain's most heroic military figures and numerous monuments, including Nelson's Column in London's Trafalgar Square have been created in his memory.
