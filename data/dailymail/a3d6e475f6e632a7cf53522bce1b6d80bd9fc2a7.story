Three BASE jumpers accused of leaping off One World Trade Center last September are expected to hand themselves in this week.

The trio have been identified as Marco Markovich, Andrew Rossig and James Brady - and their look-out was allegedly Kyle Hartwell.

Police believe the thrill-seekers climbed through the same hole in a fence to get to the top of the famous New York skyscrapper that a New Jersey teen, Justin Casquej, did last week.

Jump: Three BASE jumpers, including Marco Markovick, pictured possibly during the daring jump, are accused of leaping off One World Trade Center last September

Rossig's defence lawyer, Tim Parlatore, told the New York Post: 'They are accused of sneaking into the World Trade Center, going through quite possibly the same hole in the fence that this kid climbed through last week that they never fixed, going to the top and parachuting off.'

The three, and Hartwell, are expected to surrender Thursday and face burglary and trespassing charges, The Post reported.

Casquej rode an elevator up to the top of the building on March 16.

'They walked up - they didn't get a ride up like that kid,' Parlatore told The Post of the BASE jumpers.

Parlatore said authorities had viedo evidence from a helmet camera that one of the jumpers was wearing when they launched off the terror target September 30.

The three men, clad in black, allegedly jumped from the tower about 3 a.m.

They were captured on surveillance video falling from the sky in front of investment bank Goldman Sachs building before scurrying away into the night. The footage sparked terrorism concerns as police weren't sure at first whether the men had jumped from a building or plane.

The extreme sportsmen were pinned to 
the crime when they saved GoPro video footage of the jump, which was 
discovered during a search of their homes. It's unclear how 
investigators identified the men.

The Manhattan district attorney's office plans to charge the four with burglary, the New York Daily News reported and possibly other charges.

According to The Post, Rossig, of 
Orange County, has been busted twice in the past for BASE jumping, once 
in Bear Mountain State Park in upstate New York and again for trying to 
jump off a 33-story building in the Bronx. Brady was with him at the Bronx.

The
 news came as more details were revealed about how the 16-year-old 
daredevil managed to bypass security and reach the dizzying heights of 
the renowned tower.

The
 Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's surveillance system, worth 
$4,000, was still packed in its box when Casquej climbed the building.

Although the Port Authority bought the system in August, officials didn't want to pay to install it, the New York Post reported today.

A
 source told the paper that the official who oversaw the purchase was so
 incensed at what he saw as a very high price for a two-camera system 
that he decided not to spend any more money to have it up and running.

'He looked at me and my colleague and 
said, 'Why did I spend $4,000 on this equipment when you could have gone
 to Home Depot and gotten something cheaper?’’' the source, who is an 
electrician that worked on the project for a vendor, said.

'I
 was kind of stunned, because that’s a pretty bold statement to make 
considering we got the specs from them, and the Port Authority had it 
made to order.'  

The system 
ordered is known as a '“Two-Camera DVR Solution System.” It was supposed
 to be installed quickly after the August purchase, the source added, to
 protect the spire that was hoisted in place in May. The spire also 
contains a critically important antenna.

A
 Port Authority spokesman said that the system wasn't installed because 
infrastructure to support the system had not yet reached the top of the 
104-floor building, which is still under construction.

In the early morning hours of March 16, Casquejo, 16, accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by 
slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4 a.m., 
He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing 
scaffolding.

Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper.

Boisterous: Casquejo was much more talkative on Twitter than when reached by the Post

He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof.

Casquejo scaled equipment on the roof to reach the 1,776-foot tall Freedom Tower's antenna.

The daredevil spent two hours perched atop the city before trying to sneak his way out as the sun came up.

Casquejo was arrested at 6 a.m. and charged with misdemeanor 
criminal trespass.

New York Police 
Department brass are not pleased at the embarrassing security lapse that
 led to Casquejo being able to make it to the top of the tallest 
building in the Western Hemisphere.
