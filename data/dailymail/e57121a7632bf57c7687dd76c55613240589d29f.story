A woman who calls herself the 'Weed Fairy' is giving out free marijuana in Seattle by taping it to fliers in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood.

Yeni Sleidi, 23, from California, says she is doling out the free pot to give people a break from everyday stress while visiting a friend in the Emerald City.

'I felt so relaxed about it... I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it elsewhere in the country,' she said or a recent legalization of marijuana in Washington state.

The fliers began appearing in the neighborhood known for its nightlife over Memorial Day weekend, and Sledi told KCPQ she has posted as many as 50.

'If you are around Capitol Hill you will probably see me,' she said.

Sledi also wanted to assure people she has nothing but the best of intentions.

'I think people are a little worried, because this is something new, and suspicious,' she told the station. 'But it’s real weed and it’s not dangerous. It will get you high.'

Reactions of people interviewed by station ranged from skeptical to enthusiastic, but Sledi says that people mostly laugh.

'I wouldn’t take anything for free from someone I didn’t know,' said resident Jvon Spann.

I would smell it and if it’s good and I could tell it was good, then perhaps,' Corey Kimball added.

She claimed to have first came up with the idea in New York, where she lived during the government shutdown, because several of her friends were affected by it.

Sledi wanted to distract them from the stress. Her actions, though, drew plenty of coverage from the media.

'I'm not sure what the thought process was but I thought people would be amused by it,' she said.

The fliers posted in Seattle came with the message: 'These are tough times. Take this weed.'

Washington is one of two states that legalized recreational marijuana in 2012.

Sleidi said it was the first time she felt comfortable with attaching her name to her deeds.

[The police] probably have worse things to worry about,' she told the station. 'I don’t think they will come after the Weed Fairy.'

A Seattle Police spokesperson admitted to the station that officials aren't overly concerned about the Sledi's actions, but did say cops hope the pot does not fall into the hands of a minor.

Sledi also wrote on her Tumblr that she hopes to start a wave of pot giving.

'I hope I can start a group of weed fairies and we can all get the world high.'
