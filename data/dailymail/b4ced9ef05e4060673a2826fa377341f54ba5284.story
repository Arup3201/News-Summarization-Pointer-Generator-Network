Guilty: Hannah Bonser, pictured when she appeared at before magistrates earlier 
this year, killed Casey Kearney, 13, at a park in Doncaster

An investigation is underway into why a woman with mental health problems who begged to be admitted to a hospital was turned away before going on to kill a schoolgirl.

Hannah Bonser was jailed for at least 22 years yesterday after stabbing Casey Kearney, 13, to death.

The 26-year-old had suffered years of mental problems caused by cannabis use and claimed she heard voices in her head telling her to kill.

A month before the murder, Bonser begged staff at Doncaster Royal Infirmary to admit her.

She described herself to hospital staff as ‘a complete psychopath’. However, she was turned away from the hospital.

According to the Daily Telegraph, it emerged yesterday that an investigation immediately began following the murder looking at Bonser's previous contact  with mental health agencies .

The investigation will consider whether anymore could have been done to help Bonser.

In the months before the random murder of Miss Kearney in a park, Bonser had been warned by police for carrying a knife in public.

The defence had urged the jury to find her guilty of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility.

But she was jailed for life after the jury decided she couldn’t use her mental illness as an excuse for the attack on a complete stranger.

Casey was walking through a park in Doncaster at lunchtime on Valentine’s Day when Bonser plunged a knife into her chest.

As the killer strolled off to hand herself in to a mental health charity, Casey rang 999 and told the operator: ‘I’ve been stabbed, I’ve just been stabbed,’ before collapsing. She died later that evening in hospital.

The teenager, described as ‘mature and responsible’, had taken the bus from her home and was walking to a friend’s house for a sleepover when she was attacked.

Jailing Bonser at Sheffield Crown 
Court, Mr Justice Cranston said: ‘Why had Hannah Bonser done this to 
Casey, a young girl and a completely and wholly innocent stranger? We 
don’t know.’

There was evidence Bonser practised 
the knife attack on the door of her council flat and she bought two 
large kitchen knives hours before the killing.

Graham Reeds, prosecuting, agreed that
Bonser had a ‘personality disorder’ but said she was not a dangerous 
schizophrenic who had been misdiagnosed.

The jury convicted her after deliberating for just over two hours.

Outside court, Casey’s father Anthony Kearney said: ‘There was never a doubt in our minds this was a calculated and deliberate act and therefore deserves the maximum sentence our judicial system allows.

‘However, no sentence will bring Casey
back to us and the severity of Bonser’s actions means we will never 
have the privilege of her in our lives again.’

The jury heard Bonser may have exaggerated her mental health problems to get moved out of her council flat.

Psychiatrist Dr Nigel Eastman said she
was a ‘malingerer’ who was ‘playing games’ and making things up to 
manipulate the system. Yet no one disputed she had serious mental health
problems.

Bonser was described by her brother 
Ben, 29, as ‘like the girl in The Exorcist’ who was possessed by demons.
‘She was scary, she wanted to tear apart those around her,’ he said. In
2002, Bonser walked into a hospital on her 17th birthday complaining of
hearing voices telling her ‘to kill people’. She was admitted to 
hospital and given anti-psychotic drugs. Later that year she twice 
overdosed.

The judge confirmed Bonser had a 
‘mental and behaviour disorder due to abuse of cannabis’. She was in 
regular contact with psychiatric services between 2004 and 2007 and 
given drugs to control her delusions.

Last September, Bonser was warned by a
policeman for carrying a knife. She was still hooked on cannabis and 
regarded as a ‘strange loner’ by neighbours.

In November she was admitted to 
hospital after attempting suicide and in January her requests to be 
sectioned were rejected as ‘nothing was wrong with her’.

A month before the killing, she told 
staff at the mental health charity Rethink that she needed to be 
isolated because she was a ‘complete psychopath’.

Bonser continued to act oddly and on 
February 11 told a friend ‘she was going to get revenge on anybody who 
had upset her in her life’. She said she was ‘evil’ and needed to be 
sectioned. Three days later Casey was killed.

An inquiry led by Professor Pat 
Cantrill will analyse the actions of social workers, the psychiatric 
services, charity workers and police in the case.
