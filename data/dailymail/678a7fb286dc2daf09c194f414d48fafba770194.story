Tony Pulis is expected to be named West Bromwich manager on New Year's Day before watching from the West Ham stands as he decides where he needs to strengthen his squad in the transfer window.

Pulis has agreed a two-and-a-half year contract and will be in The Hawthorns dug-out for the first time when Gateshead visit in the FA Cup on Saturday.

The 56-year-old, who quit Crystal Palace on the eve of the season, is clear to work again from today under his severance deal with the south Londoners.

Chairman Jeremy Peace has agreed to amend Pulis’s contract so the former Stoke manager is satisfied he has total control of transfers — a potential stumbling block.

It is clear Pulis, who takes the title ‘head coach’, will have a much greater role in player recruitment than predecessor Alan Irvine, who came from an academy role.

Pulis left Selhurst Park, having been named Manager of the Year for his relegation rescue mission, following a fallout over transfers. He will compile a list of transfer targets he hopes can help him maintain a remarkable record of never being relegated in 22 years as a manager.

Peace had been focused on loan signings but is now expected to make funds available for permanent deals.

On the way out are Sebastian Blanco, Jason Davidson, Giorgos Samaras and Chris Baird. Record signing Brown Ideye, who cost £9million, has also failed to impress.

West Brom technical director Terry Burton retains his job and will help identify targets for Pulis but it remains to be seen how their relationship develops. Mervyn Day, head of recruitment, also stays.

West Brom have been prioritising a new, mobile striker and want pace on both flanks. Another full-back would be welcome too.

Ben Marshall, the Blackburn winger, has been tracked and would cost £3m, while Wigan’s Callum McManaman could be available for £5m.

Rob Kelly and Keith Downing will take charge of West Brom but both are likely to leave once Pulis brings in trusted assistants David Kemp, currently in Florida, and Gerry Francis.
