Nothing encourages forgiveness quite like a bouquet of flowers.

And even the taxman, it seems, likes to say sorry with floral arrangements when he gets his sums mixed up.

According to figures released by HM Revenues and Customs, public money was used to fund more than 100 bouquets for customers handed incorrect demands over the past five years.

One recipient of a floral apology was Florence Coke, a cafe owner from Gorton, Greater Manchester, who was wrongly sent a tax bill for nearly £1billion. 

Officials later agreed with her that the amount was incorrect, and dispatched a revised bill of £17,000 along with a bouquet of flowers.

She said: ‘I was really, really traumatised by getting that demand. It nearly killed me thinking I owed £1billion. I was new to business and naïve. It was shocking.’

Mrs Coke, 60, said it was ‘insulting’ that the taxman thought he could compensate her for the trauma of being handed such a massive demand with a cheap bunch of flowers.

‘When the flowers came they didn’t even have a note saying who they were from,’ she said.

‘I only realised they were from the taxman when a letter came afterwards apologising and saying they had sent some flowers.

‘They can’t have cost them much more than £10. It’s insulting for them to use taxpayer’s money to say sorry for their own mistakes.’

Mrs Coke, from Gorton, Greater Manchester, works six days a week to keep her café, Mama Flo’s, in Stockport, afloat. 

She said she is still trying to pay off the revised £17,000 tax bill in small instalments nearly two years later. 

She received a VAT bill for £979,092,858 in March 2013. The letter, signed by an HMRC debt collector, said: ‘If you do not pay or contact us, we can visit your premises in order to arrange for your assets to be sold by public auction.’

HMRC said it could not provide the cost of the 106 bouquets sent to customers between January 1, 2009 and July 1, 2014, but said it stuck to strict guidelines on spending public money.

A spokesman for HMRC said: ‘When we let a customer down, we always apologise and put matters right. And occasionally, having considered the specific details of a customer’s complaint, we do send flowers, but only where we consider this is the most appropriate way of saying “sorry”.’

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said the idea that flowers could compensate for the stress and worry caused by HMRC errors was ‘ludicrous.’ 

He added: ‘Rather than receiving crushed carnations in the post, taxpayers would prefer the taxman to simply get their maths right in the first place.’
