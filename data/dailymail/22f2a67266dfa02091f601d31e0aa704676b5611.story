A fascinating collection featuring almost every British Army recruitment poster for the First World War has emerged after 30 years hidden in an attic.

The extremely rare archive boasts almost 200 posters issued between 1914 and 1916, which hoped to persuade British men to do their bit to protect King and country by enlisting.

They highlight the increasingly menacing tone used in the run-up to compulsory conscription in 1916 after Britain suffered so many losses on the Western Front.

Hidden history: A fascinating collection featuring almost every British Army recruitment poster for the First World War has emerged after 30 years hidden in an attic. These two posters from 1915 (left) and 1914 (right) hoped to persuade British men to do their bit to protect King and country by enlisting

Haul: Arthur Maxted inherited the collection, including this pair from 1915) from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war. He kept them in his attic for 30 years and only realised their true value recently

Arthur Maxted inherited the collection from his grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war.

Mr Maxted has kept the posters in the loft of his home in Kent for the past 30 years, forgetting all about them, and only realised their true importance recently when he started researching and documenting the collection.

Now, 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of £20,000.

'The posters were collected by my maternal grandfather who worked for a printing company during the war,' said 72-year-old Mr Maxted.

'It is a mystery as to why he kept hold of them, as they were not of any monetary worth back then.

Collection: 100 years on from the outbreak of the war the posters, such as this one which urged men of all backgrounds to enlist, are being sold at auction and have a pre-sale estimate of £20,000

Justice: These two posters feature Britannia and urge men to recall the deadly December 1914 raid by the Imperial German navy on Scarborough (left) and the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 that cost 1198 lives (right)

Anger: This poster (left) also recalls the sinking of the Lusitania as well as other wartime atrocities, while a 1917 design sought to remind men that others, including women and children, were doing their bit

'My aunt passed them on to me about 30 years ago and they spent many years in my loft.

'It was only recently that I started to document them and realised they might be quite valuable.'

The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops.

They were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings.

Change: When it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled and recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer

Mission: The posters were the brainchild of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, a board set up in the early days of the war to bolster the number of British troops, and were displayed in public areas around towns and cities like train and bus stations and on billboards and hoardings

The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain’s declaration of war against Germany.

Many thought the war was an opportunity for adventure with friends - but when it became clear victory was more than a matter of months away, enthusiasm dwindled.

Recruitment posters quickly turned to emotional blackmail, playing on the conscience of working men who had yet to volunteer.

Tragedy: Another poster with its focus on the Scarborough raid, this time showing a damaged home and a little girl left alone to care for a baby

Messages included ‘Why aren’t you in khaki? You’ll be wanted. Enlist at once’, ‘Don’t stand looking at this - go and help!’ and ‘Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?’.

Others targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army.

One read: 'To the women of Britain. Some of your men folk are holding back on your account. Won’t you prove your love for your Country by persuading them to go?'

Target: Many posters, such as these two from 1915, targeted the wives and girlfriends of potential recruits, urging them to persuade their partners to join the army

Appeal: This 1915 poster (left) was also geared towards women, telling them their the safety of their children depended on men going out to fight, while another played on the insecurities of fathers who wanted to make their children proud

By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh.

The collection, which is only missing eight posters, is being sold by Onslows Auctioneers in Blandford, Dorset.

Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'With an inevitability of war approaching and a shortfall in soldiers, Parliament authorised an increase in the army of half a million men in August 1914.

'As a result the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee was formed to boost the recruiting effort and part of the drive included creating posters which were put up in public places.

Positive: The initial response to the posters was good and the committee was inundated with offers of enlistment following Britain¿s declaration of war against Germany

'Interestingly, the posters show how over time the methods and messages used to recruit men changed.

'Many of the early posters depended on patriotism.

'Early
 recruits viewed the war as a great adventure which was not to be 
missed, particularly as the general view was that it would all be over 
by Christmas 1914.

'Initially
 these methods of propaganda provided a steady stream of new recruits 
but by November 1914 there was a marked decline in numbers.

'As
 it became clear the war was not going to be over as quickly as first 
thought, more sophisticated and sinister methods were employed.

Output: By the time conscription was made compulsory in March 1916 the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee had issued 164 posters, with some reproduced in different sizes and in Welsh. This poster from 1916 (right), bearing the message 'Forward', was the last printed before forced enlistment was introduced

Collection: Patrick Bogue of Onslow Auctions with the collection of posters. They are expected to reach £20,000 when they go up for auction on July 9

'The messages were much more direct and even targeted the wives and children of potential soldiers, such as the now famous ‘Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?’

'This collection is almost complete - it includes every poster issued by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee apart from about eight.

'A collection like this is incredibly rare and serves to remind us of the iconic images used to recruit soldiers for this historic war.'

The posters will go on public display at Chalke Valley History Festival in Wiltshire from June 23 to 29 ahead of the auction on July 9.

At the outbreak of war in 1914, many young men were quick to enlist into the Army - spurred on by a desire to serve their country, or simply to avoid unemployment. By the end of September 1914 more than 750,000 men had joined up - many of them as part of 'Pals battalions' from the same workplace, football team or friendship group.

However, within a year of Great Britain's declaration of war in August 1914, it became obvious that the country would not be able to continue fighting with just voluntary recruits.

Although the famous 'Your Country Needs You' poster helped encourage more than one million men to enlist by January 1915 this was not enough to cover the rising number of casualties and the government decided there was no choice but to bring in conscription - compulsory active service.

The Military Service Act became law in March 1916 and imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, other than the medically unfit, teachers, clergymen and certain industrial workers.

Conscientious objectors who opposed fighting on moral ground were also spared the draft, as were those living in Ireland, and men called up could appeal against the call up at a local Military Service Tribunal.

Married men were subject to conscription following the passing of a second Act in May 1916, and in 1918 a further law raised the age limit to 51.

Conscripted men were not given a choice of which service, regiment or unit they joined. However, if they expressed a preference to join the Navy then it had first refusal on whether to take him.

Throughout the war around 2.5 million men joined the Armed Forces through conscription, with 1.1 million of them joining during the first year.
