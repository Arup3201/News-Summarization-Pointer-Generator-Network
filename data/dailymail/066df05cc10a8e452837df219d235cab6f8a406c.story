A Wall Street stockbroker and a clerk at a prominent Manhattan law firm have been charged with insider trading involving a middleman who would chew up napkins on which he passed illegal tips.

Authorities say Steven Metro, 40, a managing clerk and non-practicing attorney at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, would pass tips about corporate mergers involving the firm's clients through the intermediary to Morgan Stanley stockbroker Vladimir Eydelman, 42.

They allege that the four-year scheme earned the suspects more than $5.6million of illegal profit and $33million of illegal trades, with some profits being kicked back to Metro, and other profits spent by Eydelman on a home, jewelry and a $118,000 2011 Maserati GranTurismo.

The plot was uncovered after the go-between, who had become friends with Metro after meeting him in 1995 in their first year of law school, began cooperating with the FBI in December.

U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey said transactions covered by the criminal complaint included a 2009 investment in Sirius XM Radio by Liberty Media Corp, and a 2013 merger of Office Depot Inc and OfficeMax Inc.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related civil lawsuit against Eydelman and Metro.

‘Law firms are sanctuaries for the confidential treatment of client information,’ Daniel Hawke, chief of the SEC enforcement division's market abuse unit, said in a statement.

‘This scheme victimized not only a law firm but also its corporate clients and ultimately the investors in those companies.’

Eydelman, of Colts Neck, New Jersey, was charged with eight counts of securities fraud, and Metro, of Katonah, New York, was charged with nine counts.

Each was also hit with four counts of tender offer fraud and one count of conspiracy.

Morgan Stanley spokesman James Wiggins said the company has put Eydelman, formerly for Oppenheimer & Co., on leave, will cooperate with authorities, and does not tolerate insider trading.

Speaking to Wall Street Journal, a representative for Simpson Thacher & Bartlett called the charges against Metro ‘deeply disturbing and unprecedented in our long history,’ adding that the law clerk has been terminated. 

Rendezvous: Prosecutors say the suspects'  middleman would meet Eydelman near the central clock in Grand Central Station and pass him a napkin or a Post-It bearing a stock tip

According to the complaint, Metro repeatedly accessed non-public information on Simpson Thacher's computer systems to identify documents establishing that a client of the firm was about to participate in a corporate transaction.

He would then meet with the middleman, identified in court papers as a confidential witness, or ‘CW,’ in bars and cafes, and pass the information by showing it to him on his cell phone screen, Bloomberg BussinessWeek reported.

Prosecutors said the middleman would in turn arrange a meeting with Eydelman near the central clock in Grand Central Station.

They said the middleman would show Eydelman a napkin or piece of paper, such as a Post-It note, containing the ticker symbol of the stock that was to be purchased.

Once Eydelman memorized the tip, ‘the CW then would fold up the paper or napkin with the ticker symbol(s) written on it, place it into his mouth, and chew' - and sometimes eat - the paper or napkin to destroy it as Eydelman watched, the criminal complaint said.

Authorities said the middleman this year began recording conversations with the defendants, including February 20 when Eydelman gave him a cigar box containing $7,000 meant for Metro, who wanted money to buy and renovate a home.

‘Take these cigars, put it to good use,’ Eydelman told the informant, according to the criminal complaint.

According to the real estate site Trulia, in September 2009 – about six months into the alleged insider trading scheme - Eydelman purchased a 8,863-squate-foot in Colts Neck worth $1.9million.

The case resembles a scheme that federal prosecutors in New Jersey said ran from 1994 to 2011, netted over $37 million of profit, and also involved a middleman who later cooperated.

There, the lawyer Matthew Kluger was charged with passing merger tips to the trader Garrett Bauer, with the help of middleman Kenneth Robinson.

Kluger was sentenced to 12 years in prison, Bauer to nine years, and Robinson to 2-1/4 years.
