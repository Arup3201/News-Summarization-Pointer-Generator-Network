Mortar boards are so last century. In China, female students are attending their graduation ceremonies dressed in wedding gowns.

The unusual practice sees young women shunning caps and gowns and instead donning white bridal-style dresses, which many believe is a more fitting outfit for such a pivotal point in their lives.

Others say they simply want to feel more beautiful while picking up their diplomas at the milestone event.

Unlike British graduation ceremonies which are very formal events, Chinese universities appear less bound by traditional customs.

In fact, it's common for parents to be absent - the event is more of chance for students to say goodbye to their student years.

The importance of the graduation photoshoot
 with classmates has become one of the most important aspect of the day, and seeing the final pictures is the reward for their achievement.

Students are 
free to design their own perfect way to celebrate and fancy dress themes have flourished - especially wedding attire.

This summer, Chinese universities have seen more and more female graduates opting for bridal frocks, complete with tiara and jewellery, for their graduation photos.

'The feeling of wearing white is very elegant, like a nymph,' said graduate Hu Fan, 22, a student from Hunan, central China.

Liu Xiangping, a student from Xi'an Polytechnic University in central 
China, said: 'The wedding dress makes things feel more meaningful.'

Along with her classmates and thousands of other female graduates she rented a dress for about Â£4 for the day to wear for graduation, reports the Independent.

She
 says that to graduate from university is something 'full of 
significance' and believes that the wedding dresses and photos are a 
'unique way of celebrating this' with friends.

Other
 interesting fancy dress worn by graduates for their final photos
included pirates, builders, and even Qing dynasty attire.

Despite
 the students believing that the wearing of wedding dresses for 
graduation is all in the name of fun, Lu Xiaowen, deputy director of the
 Institute of Sociology at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, 
believes the decision to wear a wedding dress has a deeper symbolic 
meaning.

Lu Xiaowen believes that wearing wedding dresses and other special outfits 
during graduation is a last expression of creativity by Chinese 
students, and that with massive competition facing graduatess for jobs, it's a final manifestation of 
freedom before entering the working world.
