It's a scene most parents will hope they never have to see - the sight of their child self-harming. 

But this nightmare scenario became a reality for Sara Matthews, 40, who walked into the kitchen in her Bristol home one day to find her seven-year-old daughter, Charlie, clutching a knife.

'I walked into the kitchen and found Charlie with a knife against her wrists, it was horrific,' the mother recalled on today's This Morning.

Charlie told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford how she no longer feels suicidal as she did when she was seven as she has been transferred to a specialist school after being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome

The mother later learnt her daughter didn't just intend to hurt herself but end her life as she had left a suicide note at her primary school.    

Presenter Ruth Langsford, a mother-of-one, said it sounded like something from a horror movie and asked Sara how she dealt with the situation. 

'I had to remain calm for her but I wanted to cry and scream,' Sara said. 'I had to calm her down and took her outside and we sat on her swing set and talked about she she felt. She kept saying she felt different, that something was wrong and she didn't fit in.'

Sara and her husband Keyton, 42, had noticed that their daughter had become more withdrawn but they had no idea why - or how serious the situation had become.

'It started when she as about six, she started to say she didn't like herself, and often had emotional outbursts.

Charlie said she used to feel different and like she didn't fit in but with the support of her family and medical intervention, she now 'likes being who I am'

'She found social settings were bewildering as she often misread people's expressions. This made her withdrawn and she started wanting to miss school.'

Sara couldn't understand why her daughter was feeling like such an outsider as she had attended the same, small private school since she was 18-months-old so knew all her classmates well.

'I couldn't blame myself, I knew something was going on with Charlie,' Sara said.

After the terrifying incident in the kitchen, Sara took her daughter to see a doctor who prescribed anti-depressants. 

She was also referred to a specialist who diagnosed her with Asperger's syndrome, an autistic spectrum disorder. 

The condition affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour and can lead to sufferers feeling anxious and depressed.

Thanks to the medication she was given, the support of her family and being transferred to a specialist school where they have expert counsellors, Charlie, now 11, said she's now feeling much better.

She joined her mother on the This Morning sofa to tell Ruth and Eamonn Holmes: 'I'm at a much better school now, I'm enjoying school and have lots of friends. The teachers are supportive and I get a lot of attention.'

For any parents of children who have been self-harming, Charlie had the following advice: 'One day they will come round and it will be much better but it will take a while.'

Her mother added that it helps if the child can find something they 'love and are passionate about.' 

For Charlie, it was discovering a love of beauty pageants which she now enjoys competing in and supporting charities by taking part in fundraising events.

Charlie, who appeared on the ITV show in a colourful, pretty party dress, said she's now realised: 'I like being who I am.' 

She was invited to share her story on the show after it has been revealed that the number of children ending up in A&E after suffering a mental health crisis has almost doubled since 2010.

This week is Children's Mental Health Week, which aims to raise awareness of these troubled children and how they can be helped.

Earlier this week, the Duchess of Cambridge recorded a video message showing her support. 

Kate, 33, said that she and her husband the Duke of Cambridge have seen how many children struggle to cope with bullying, bereavement, family breakdown and other issues, which can lead to depression, anxiety, addiction and self-harm.

The pregnant mother-of-one said the stigma around mental health means that many children do not get the help they so badly need, and this needs to change.

She said: 'Both William and I sincerely believe that early action can prevent problems in childhood from turning into larger ones later in life.'
