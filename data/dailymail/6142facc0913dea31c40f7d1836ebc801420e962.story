The writer of Quirke, the latest BBC drama to face complaints over inaudible, mumbled dialogue, has admitted watcing the programme with the aid of subtitles.

Andrew Davies - one of the UK's best known screenwriters, whose work includes Pride and Prejudice, House of Cards and Bridget Jones Diary - said he and his wife struggled to hear what the actors were saying, and required the assistance of subtitles to follow what was going on.

Quirke, which stars Gabriel Byrne and Michael Gambon, is the latest BBC series to experience mumbling actors and poor sound quality, after Jamaica Inn was hit by the same complaints.

Davies, 77, adapted Quirke from the books by Booker Prize-winning author John Banville, but said that even his familiarity with the script wasn't enough to follow what was happening on screen.

Settling down to watch the programme at their home in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, Davies and his wife of 53 years, Diane Huntley, needed to read along with the dialogue in order to make sense of it.

'She said, "Do you mind if we have the subtitles on?",' Davies explained to RadioTimes.com.

'It's a funny thing, mumbling. It's a bit to do with actors, a bit do with with modern, flat-screen televisions and both my wife and I are of an age where our hearing is beginning to go,' he added.

Last week, a BBC spokesman said it had 'received complaints from some viewers unhappy with the sound quality during Quirke'.

'We appreciate that some viewers experienced problems with the sound when watching Quirke,' he added.

'A wide range of factors can influence audibility and we are looking into why this should be and whether there are any steps we can take to improve the experience for the audience for episode two...We will continue to work with others in the television industry on this important subject.'

Davies said part of the problem with the sound may be that Quirke's production staff are so familiar with the script that they subconsciously fill in the mumbled lines when they listen back during editing.

'I could hear it because I knew what the words were. And I think that's often the problem with the people in the production... When you know what the lines are, there's a tendency to think you've heard them alright whereas if you didn't know the thing, maybe you wouldn't,' he said.

Viewers watching the crime drama have reported having to turn the volume on their television sets up to the maximum setting, while others simply gave up and switched off.

Set in 1950s Dublin, Quirke follows the city’s chief pathologist as he investigates a murder.

But it seems many of the 4.2million who watched the first episode in the three-part series struggled to follow the action, with TV presenter Richard Madeley leading the complaints on Twitter.

Not the first time: The sound problems come after another BBC drama, Jamaica Inn (pictured), generated more than 2,000 complaints about 'incoherent mumbling'

Madeley blamed the BBC’s sound editing, tweeting: ‘Was really looking forward to Quirke, BBC1, 9pm – but despite winding volume up to 100 per cent, still can’t hear at least a third of dialogue! Again!'

He later added: ‘And it’s definitely the programme – switched channels and sound boomed out massively loudly. Back to Quirke, and inaudible. Grrrrrr!!!!’

The sound problems come after another BBC drama, Jamaica Inn, generated more than 2,000 complaints about ‘incoherent mumbling’ when it was broadcast in three parts of the Easter weekend.

The
 BBC originally said that technical faults were responsible but following an 
investigation admitted another problem was that some of the cast 
had failed to deliver their lines clearly.
