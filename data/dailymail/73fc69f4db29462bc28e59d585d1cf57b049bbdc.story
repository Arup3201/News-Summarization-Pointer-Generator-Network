Steffon Armitage's dream of playing at next year's World Cup for England could be over after he was named in Toulon's squad for their European Champions Cup opener against Scarlets on Sunday.

Armitage's proposed move to Bath, which would make him available for selection for England, hit the rocks this week after a breakdown in negotiations between the Aviva Premiership side and back-to-back European champions Toulon.

If the flanker plays on Sunday, which looks almost certain given his inclusion in the squad, then he will be ineligible for European games for Bath, making the prospect of signing him far less attractive. Head coach Mike Ford insisted earlier this week that such a scenario would terminate their interest.

Bath had moved to bring in the European player of the year, 29, due to a back row crisis. Francois Louw, Carl Fearns, Matt Garvey and Alafoti Fa'osiliva are all injured, while Leroy Houston is banned.

Under the Premiership's injury dispensation rules, clubs are permitted to spend up to £400,000 on cover for a like-for-like player who has been ruled out for at least 12 weeks.

Armitage made five appearances for England while at London Irish in 2009

The move had the backing of England head coach Stuart Lancaster and the RFU, whose rules stipulate no-one playing their rugby outside of the Premiership can wear the Red Rose.

With the World Cup in England less than a year away, Armitage, who earned five caps for England in 2009, would need to move to the Premiership this season to fit England's criteria.

The former London Irish man had been exploring the possibility of playing for France - where he has lived for the past three years - but had a recent change of heart and began searching for an English club with the reluctant blessing of Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal and head coach Bernard Laporte.

It looks like it is back to square one though for one of the world's best back row forwards, who returned to Toulon training this week and looks set to feature in their European opener on Sunday.

Armitage was recently included in a provisional France squad, subject to his selection by their Sevens team for Olympic qualification. If his route back with England is denied, he may revisit his interest in representing Les Bleus at the World Cup.
