A grandfather has amassed Britain's biggest collection of garden ornaments - including a phone box, 200-year-old ploughs, fountains, gnomes and an air raid shelter.

Liam Lawlor, 66, has amassed thousands of unusual nick nacks to decorate his patio and lawn outside his home over the last 40 years.

His plants, flowers and topiary are surrounded by unusual objects such as railway signs, sculptures, statues, kettles, tractors, pub signs and water features.

Quite a collection: Grandfather Liam Lawlor, 66, has transformed the garden outside his home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, with an unusual collection of ornaments and antiques

Cheers! Mr Lawlor has been collecting the unusual items - such as this ornament showing a waiter drinking, for the last 40 years

Retro: Mr Lawlor bought this 1950s red telephone box around 25 years ago for £100

Hanging on the telephone: Mr Lawlor has also placed two old telephones inside his red telephone box

Collectables: A deer with huge antlers is one of the biggest attractions in Mr Lawlor's garden

Mr Lawlor also bought a 1950s telephone box 25 years ago for £100 pounds and two ploughs which are more than 200 years old - making them the oldest items in his collection.

His huge collection - which includes scores of garden gnomes - is worth an estimated £10,000.

Mr Lawlor, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, has previously won two awards for his garden in the city's In Bloom competition.

Character: A leprechaun toy stands on top of a pot of gold in Mr Lawlor's garden in Leeds, West Yorkshire

Piece of history: Mr Lawlor says he likes to collect items which are old as they have their own stories behind them

Estimate: The grandfather's unusual collection of ornaments is believed to be worth £10,000

Surprise: Ornaments are hidden throughout the garden - with this gnome making an appearance in a plant pot

Dedication: Mr Lawlor said he loves his garden and won't ever sell or get rid of his collection

Pit stop: Mr Lawlor sits among his unusually-designed garden which he happily admits many visitors say they've never seen anything like it

The grandfather-of-four buys most of his collection from auctions and car boot fairs.

He said: 'Lots of people say they have never seen anything like it, and I believe them.

'I dread to think how much I have spent over the 40 years I've been here. I wouldn't be surprised if it was around £10,000.

'I collect things that are old because they don't make any things today that are any good - they don't last two minutes.  I like the stories behind each of the items.

Mish mash: A more traditional garden gnome has also made its way on to Mr Lawlor's patio

Lined up: Mr Lawlor has a versatile collection which includes an outdoor fire place, pictured left, and several  old-style irons and presses

Ready for a brew: An old metal kettle can be seen in front of a fire place outside of Mr Lawlor's home

Warming up: A large thermometer hangs off the wall of Mr Lawlor's home

keep on collecting: Mr Lawlor pictured with some of his other collectibles and framed copies of some of his favourite celebrity's birth certificates

'I enjoy gardening and often have people stop and have a look when they walk past. It gives a lot of pleasure to people and I don't mind people looking in.'

Mr Lawlor added that he will never part with his collection -

'I would never get rid of any of it. I'll be leaving it to my grandchildren to decide what to do with it all.'

He is now opening up his garden to the public for the first time for Children in Need.

Closed off: Mr Lawlor has agreed to open up his home to public for the first time so they can see his collection to raise money for charity

Balancing act: A Laurel and Hardy figurine can be seen on top of a model waiter's tray

A street lamp has been painted in several different colours to fit in Mr Lawlor's mish mash of nick nacks

Countdown: A clock with different types of birds in place of numbers on the side of a garden shed

Headdress: The dear has its own reins draped over its head and around its neck
