The latest round of words has been added to the Oxford English Dictionary - including one of the rudest in the English language.

The offensive word - which has been added under the 'c' section - joins nearly 900 other terms newly added to the reference collection.

Among them is 'Old Etonian', which refers to an old boy of Eton College, 'bathroom break', 'beat boxer', and 'scissor kick'.

Four times a year, the Oxford English Dictionary chooses a select few new words to add to its pages.

Other words on the list include 'bookaholic,' 'e-ticket,' 'bestie', and 'honk'.

The last update saw words like 'twerk' and 'selfie'.

Katherine Connor Martin, head of US dictionaries, said 'wackado' and 'wackadoodle' elaborations of wacky, wack, or wacko, used to refer to people regarded as eccentric, had also been added to the OED.

She said: 'The silliness of the words themselves contributes to their mildly contemptuous effect.

'Similar-sounding nonsense words were used as refrains in popular songs like Doo Wacka Doo in the early 20th century, but it isn’t certain that these directly impacted the later development of wackadoo and wackadoodle, which didn’t become common until the end of the century.

'The phrase crap shoot arose in American English in the late 19th century to refer to a game of dice (or ‘craps’). Nowadays, that original use is relatively rare, but the term has become very common in a figurative use, denoting a situation or undertaking regarded as uncertain, risky, or unpredictable.'

Last year, the swear word 's***storm'
 was entered into the German equivalent of the Oxford English Dictionary
 after gaining popularity during the eurozone crisis.

Among them is 'Old Etonian' (pictured), which refers to an old boy of Eton College, 'bathroom break', 'beat boxer', and 'scissor kick'

Duden
 said it was reflecting the common use of the word among Germans, 
including even Chancellor Angela Merkel who said it during a public 
meeting recently.

The phrase is used to denote a public outcry, particularly one that gains pace on the internet.

The
 online version of Duden defines the word as: 'Noun, masculine – a storm
 of protest in a communications medium of the internet, which is 
associated in part with insulting remarks.'
