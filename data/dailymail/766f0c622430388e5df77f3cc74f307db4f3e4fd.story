David Cameron was at Chequers preparing for a difficult trip to defend the Union in Scotland when the bombshell dropped.

Alerted to an ‘important’ Ukip announcement at 11am, Cameron was reading official papers – with the television on in the background – when to his horror he realised that Douglas Carswell was defecting.

Such was his party’s ignorance of the coming earthquake that only yesterday an invitation to party donors was circulated saying: ‘You’re invited to a drinks reception and discussion with Douglas Carswell on Tuesday September 23 at Conservative campaign headquarters.’

It seems that Ukip, famously derided by Cameron as ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’, has pulled off one of the biggest political surprises for years.

Despite the shock, Cameron has only himself and his advisers to blame for not taking Ukip – and Douglas Carswell – more seriously.

The Tory whips – who impose discipline – had washed their hands of Carswell, who has rebelled against the government line 62 times since the election.

Now, he has paid them back in kind. I have learned that Carswell has been in constant talks with Nigel Farage for more than a year, both face to face and regularly on the telephone.

One of the masterminds behind yesterday's brilliantly stage-managed political theatre was Stuart Wheeler, the former Ukip treasurer

Since June, the conversations between the pair have become deadly serious, and were conducted in a private house owned by a wealthy Ukip supporter.

Worryingly for the Prime Minister, Farage has also held lengthy discussions with a number of other disaffected Tory MPs.

Another of the masterminds behind yesterday’s brilliantly stage-managed political theatre was Stuart Wheeler, the former Ukip treasurer.

The mild-mannered Wheeler, who made a fortune through the spread betting firm IG Index, gave a record £5million donation to the Tories shortly before the 2001 election because they were committed to keeping the pound.

Over the past year Wheeler, who lives in the Jacobean Chilham Castle in Kent, has been quietly holding court with potential Tory defectors over lunches in London’s Mayfair. He’s wined and dined nine MPs.

The lunches are usually in the luxury five-star Brown’s hotel, which is owned by Rocco Forte – who is a Tory donor – or Serafino, an Italian restaurant, which has been a landmark in Mayfair for more than 40 years. He entertained Carswell twice at Brown’s.

Wheeler, who is 80 next year, was a lifelong Tory until he was expelled in 2009 after giving £100,000 to  Ukip. He learnt of his suspension from a journalist, and was bad-mouthed by Tory sources as ‘yesterday’s man’.

Another spectacular misjudgment from the party apparatus.

‘The nine Tory MPs were happy to talk to Stuart because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty to the party,’ says one  senior source.

‘Stuart understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey.

Stuart is quietly confident that more may follow Douglas.’

The optimism of Wheeler is in contrast to the black mood within Downing Street: put simply, the PM’s advisers haven’t a clue whether any more will follow.

In the short term, they have one big problem – and it’s not one that is easily surmounted, because it’s the Prime Minister himself.

There are at least 50 un-reconstructed Cameron haters on the backbenches, including Euro-sceptics like Peter Bone, the MP for Wellingborough, who is seen as a potential defector.

It’s little secret that Nadine Dorries, who had the Whip withdrawn after she went into the jungle with ITV’s I’m a Celebrity..., has been linked to Ukip, too. They both have safe seats which the Tories can’t afford to lose.

Dozens more backbenchers feel aggrieved they have been overlooked for promotion, or dismissed from government jobs, or simply ignored. ‘Cameron rarely sets  foot in the Commons tea room,’ says one Tory MP.

‘On the occasions he graces us with his presence, he is flanked by his praetorian guard to protect him. The chickens are coming home to roost.’ As for 43-year-old Douglas Carswell, it’s interesting to note that he has not been subjected to the personal attacks which would usually follow such a devastating betrayal. He is popular in the party, with few enemies.

While many Tory MPs expect the party to lose the coming by-election, the manner of his going offers them one small but important crumb of comfort.

It is understood that Mr Carswell was among nine Tories wined and dined by millionaire Ukip donor Stuart Wheeler at a series of discreet lunches in Mayfair

Carswell could simply have switched his allegiance and remained as an MP for the rest of this Parliament at least.

But he chose to do the decent thing and resign so he can fight for the seat under Ukip’s banner. His resignation means other Tory MPs tempted to follow him will feel obliged to go down the same route. How many will be willing to risk losing their seat in a by-election?

Perhaps Carswell had the courage to jump ship because four years ago he romped home in Clacton with a 12,500 majority.

A gangly six-footer, he grew up in Kenya, where his parents worked as doctors. His father, Wilson, a surgeon, diagnosed the first case of HIV in Uganda in the 1980s.

Douglas went to St Andrews School in Kenya, then the exclusive Charterhouse School in Surrey. He studied history at the University of East Anglia and King’s College, London, and worked in television and investment banking before politics. He finally became MP for Harwich in 2005 with a narrow majority, but was far more successful when the constituency was redrawn as Clacton in 2010.

Mr Cameron was ambushed by the defection of Mr Carswell who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the Prime Minister's policy on Europe

No one should doubt that Carswell has physical as well as political courage. In January, the hardliner on law and order lived up to his rhetoric when he chased a 29-year-old shoplifter and pinned him against a wall until the police arrived. ‘I collared him literally,’ he said. When the police led the man away in handcuffs, Carswell tweeted: ‘Police response time pretty effective. Arrested. Now off to my advice surgery.’

The MP, who has been criticised for billing the taxpayer £655 in expenses for a super-sized ‘love seat’, was initially overwhelmed by the heritage of Westminster when he arrived, but the feeling didn’t last. ‘Parliament is supine, spineless, dominated by spivery and spivs, it doesn’t hold the Government to account,’ he said in an interview. ‘Our primary function is to provide the cheerleader chorus for the frontbench. Parliament is one giant conspiracy against the electorate.’

After rejecting the usual blandishments from the party leadership to stop rebelling, such as the hint of ministerial office, he said: ‘I felt this incredible sense of liberation when I realised that I wasn’t going to play the game.’ Thoughtful and intellectual, his defection is all the harder to dismiss by the Cameroons. Carswell is one of a growing number of Tory MPs and ministers who doubt the PM’s ability to claw back powers from Brussels ahead of a 2017 referendum on whether should Britain should stay in the EU.

Last summer, the Foreign Office’s review into the extent of Brussels’ influence – as part of Cameron’s supposed renegotiation – reported back that the relationship between Britain and the EU was broadly fine.

Carswell’s response was characteristically blunt: ‘Europhile Whitehall elite says EU membership is a good thing – SHOCK.’

If the Prime Minister now wants to stop more defections, he will have to spell out for the first time that like Nigel Farage he, too, could lead Britain out of the EU – and he will have to say it like he means it.
