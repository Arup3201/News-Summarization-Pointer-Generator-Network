Percy Harvin played for the Seattle Seahawks for less than two years before his shock trade to the New York Jets.

The Seahawks spent around $18.4million on the do-it-all, but injury-prone receiver, who played just eight games for the franchise.

One of them was a dazzling cameo in February's Super Bowl victory which showcased some of his speed and playmaking ability.

But his short career has been plagued with concerns about his temperament and toughness.

With 60 NFL appearance to his name, the 26-year-old moves his third team in six years since being taken as the 22nd overall pick by Minnesota in 2009.

Plagued with migraines throughout college and his first few years in the NFL, Harvin's superb rookie season was a factor in the Vikings reaching the NFC Championship game.

Following the retirement of Brett Favre, Harvin's spell in Minnesota turned sour after the arrival of inconsistent quarterback Christian Ponder, the 12th pick of the 2011 draft.

Harvin fell out with coach Leslie Frazier, one of football's good guys, and moved to Seattle two years later, signing a six-year, $67m deal. The Seahawks traded their 2013 first-round draft choice, one of their three seventh-round draft choices and a 2014 third-round draft pick.

The move drew criticism from then-MVP Adrian Peterson, who tweeted: 'The best all around player I ever seen or you'll ever see! Goes to Seattle! I feel like I just got kicked in the stomach. Several times!!!'

After surgery on a hip injury later that summer, he would only play one regular season game - ironically in a 30-20 win over Minnesota.

Harvin returned for the business end of the Super Bowl-winning campaign, but sustained a concussion in the divisional win over New Orleans which saw him miss the NFC Championship game against the 49ers.

But his performance in MetLife Stadium - where he will now ply his trade under Rex Ryan - showcased his ability.

He had two rushes for 45 yards and ran back the second-half kick off 87 yards for a touchdown in the 43-8 win over Denver.

While rumours of dressing room discontent abound - particularly with quarterback Russell Wilson - some of Harvin's Seahawks team-mates reacted with incredulity on Twitter.

'Damn they got my n****....' said Marshawn Lynch.

Cliff Avril was on a similar page, saying: 'This business is crazy... Hate to see my boy @Percy_Harvin go,' on the social networking site.

Yet Harvin has struggled to stretch the field this season and has failed to shine, despite being used as a runner, receiver and on special teams, contributing 225 yards of offense in five games. 

He joins a struggling franchise which has lost its last six games. And with the inconsistent Geno Smith just about holding off the jaded Michael Vick at quarterback, one wonders how long it will be before Harvin explodes off the field once more.
