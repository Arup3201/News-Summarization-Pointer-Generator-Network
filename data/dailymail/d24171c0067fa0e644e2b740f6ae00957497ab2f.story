The bloody jacket of a missing college student has been found with up to 20 puncture holes suggesting that she had been stabbed, police said on Monday. 

Anarae Schunk, 20 has not been seen since the early hours of September 22 when she left Nina's Grill in Burnsville, Minnesota with her ex-boyfriend Shavelle Chavez-Nelson, 31 and his current girlfriend.

Police revealed on Friday that they had uncovered information that led them to believe Miss Schunk, who attended University of Minnesota, was the victim of a homicide.

Fading hope: A bloody jacket belonging to UM student Anarae Schunk, which had 20 holes suggestive of stab wounds, has been found, police said today

Miss Schunk's brother Tyson Schunk told the Star Tribune that police found his 
sister’s white jacket with a U logo at the apartment of Chavez-Nelson’s 
ex-wife in St Paul.

A knife connected with 
the case was found on the roof of the building, police said.

The 20-year-old's family are awaiting DNA results from the jacket and the knife.

According to Kare11, the police department told the girl's family that, 'without a shadow of doubt', she was no longer alive. They have not elaborated further on that information.

Dozens of volunteers continued to search fields close to Pickerel Lake and vacant lots for the missing student on Monday.

Mr Schunk added that the family are desperate to find the young woman's body so that someone may be charged with her killing.

Miss Schunk was last seen outside Nina's Grill with her ex and his current girlfriend Ashley Conrade, 24, of Rosemount.

Nelson was arrested for shooting Palagor Jobi outside the bar that same night. The altercation 
occurred after Mr Jobi started talking to Nelson's current girlfriend, 
Ashley Conrade.

After 
the shooting, Nelson, Conrade, and Miss Schunk hopped into a car and sped off.

Nelson was eventually captured. Conrade, 24, is accused of harboring Nelson.

Anarae Schunk dated Nelson for a few 
months in 2012 until she discovered that he was living with a 
woman and the pair had a child together.

She had recently got in touch with him as her owed her $5,000 from when they were dating and she wanted the money back.

Shavelle Chavez-Nelson has been charged with second-degree murder and is being held on $2million bail, while Conrade's bail has been set at $250,000.

Neither Nelson nor Conrade will say what happened to Miss Schunk. 

According to court documents, Nelson was just released a week ago on a $25,000 burglary and weapons charge.

Burnsville
Police released a statement today that said: 'Neither Nelson, Conrade 
or multiple other persons questioned by police have provided any 
information about Anarae Schunk's current whereabouts.'

Miss Schunk's brother added: 'We are taking time to mourn together with loved ones. 
It's hard to stomach. The support we have received from all over truly 
helps as we ... persist through this difficult time.'
