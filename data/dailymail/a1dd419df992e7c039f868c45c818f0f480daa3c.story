British summer time has officially begun after the clocks went forward one hour overnight - although the weather seems unlikely to oblige with wet and windy conditions forecast for today.

Worse still, temperatures seem unlikely to increase above 13c although the Met Office said that rain should clear in the early afternoon leaving a mix of sunny spells and blustery showers.

The change meant the nation lost an hour's sleep, but it marks the start of the evenings getting longer.

Clocks went forward one hour overnight marking the start of British Summer Time

Bury's crunch League 2 with Southend only featured six-minutes' play due to a torrential downpour

The referee was forced to abandon the game due to a waterlogged pitch after calling the players inside

Parts of the pitch had large standing pools of water which made it too dangerous to continue 

Bury's crunch League Two fixture with Southend was abandoned after just six minutes when the referee Tony Harrington decided the pitch was waterlogged.  

Mr Harrington led the players inside but soon called off the game when the conditions worsened considerably. 

Forecaster Nicola Willis said: 'Sunday's rain will clear away overnight and we will see clearer conditions and a north westerly breeze and continuing into Monday.

'But further south we will see another band of rain pushing west to east during Monday, with rain coming in from the west.'

The rain could turn to sleet and even snow on higher ground. 

She said that rain will hit all parts of Britain tomorrow, starting in Northern Ireland, Wales and the south west of England, moving eastwards. 

There will also be 20mph winds with gusts of up to 55mph. 

The bad weather is expected to continue on Monday with further rain arriving from the west. Although some sunny intervals should break through on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Luckily, for many people, their smartphones and computers automatically update the time, but many watches, cars, cookers and traditional clocks have to be changed manually.   

Despite the start of British Summer Time, the first three days look particularly grim with rain and strong winds
