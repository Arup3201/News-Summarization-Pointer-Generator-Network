The wife of the Minnesota State football coach accused of child pornography made an emotional statement today, saying that her husband is innocent and charges against him were 'ridiculous and baseless'.

Melodee Hoffner said she hoped authorities would reconsider the charges against her husband after videos of their three children, aged nine, eight and five, dancing naked were found on his school cell phone by an IT worker.

Todd Hoffner, of Eagle Lake, faces two felony counts related to child pornography after authorities said they found nude images of the 46-year-oldâ€™s children earlier this month.

Emotional plea: Melodee Hoffner defended her husband today after the college football coach was accused of having child pornography on his cell phone in Minnesota

Mrs Hoffner, whose voice occasionally cracked during her statement, said the videos were innocent and that she and her husband were 'in shock' when he was arrested.

'My family does what every family does - we take videos and pictures of our kids in all their craziness. My husband would not ever abuse our children or any other child,' Mrs Hoffner said, according to the Star Tribune.

She is a licensed school counselor and said she knows the signs of children who have been abused. The mother-of-three said the charges were 'ridiculous and baseless'.

Mrs Hoffner said defiantly that the couple's three children were healthy and well-adjusted and had normal relationships with their parents, teachers and friends.

Todd Hoffner had taken his cell phone to the college IT department on August 10 to be fixed when an employee found the allegedly inappropriate recordings.

The coach was free on $40,000 bail and is on administrative leave from his job as head football coach at Minnesota State University.

Suspicions: Head football coach Todd Hoffner, 46, was arrested on allegations that he had possessed and produced child pornography

He was arrested on August 21 on suspicion of owning and producing child pornography.

Hoffner
was escorted off the football field and has been on 
leave from his coaching position since then.

After an investigation and a search of his home, he was arrested.

Blue Earth County authorities continued to examine computer disks removed from the family home but have yet to find any other material of minors.

A university investigation is pending, according to spokesman Dan Benson.

'The University's top priority is ensuring the safety and well-being of its students, program participants, and the community.

'The
University is not aware of any allegations affecting university 
students or program participants,' Benson said in the statement.

Assistant coach Aaron Keen told the Star Tribune: 'The whole situation comes as a shock and is still a shock.'

He added that the players were 'responding well' since news surfaced.

Hoffner is in his fifth year as Minnesota State's head football coach. He led the team to the playoffs in 2008 and 2009, and a share of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference title in 2011.

He was named NSIC coach of the year in 2009 and was previously the offensive coordinator at the University of South Dakota.

A spokeswoman at the university told the Mankato Free Press that Hoffner earns an annual salary of $101,000 along with fringe benefits worth $31,000. His contract was renewed on July 1 for four years.

Two complaints have been filed against him since he has been with 
the university, according to the spokeswoman. Details have not been disclosed.
