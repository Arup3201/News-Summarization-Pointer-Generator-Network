Thousands of Spaniards have an added reason to celebrate this festive season after scooping prizes in the world's richest lottery.

Champagne flowed in quantities unseen since the start of a savage recession hit the country as jubilant winners celebrated their timely windfall in the annual Christmas prize draw.

And one family was thanking their luck after discovering they all had winning tickets.

One ticket-holder who slept in Sunday 
morning said he'd leapt up from his bed in surprise after hearing the 
television announce his ticket number for 'El Gordo' or The Fat One - 
the lottery's top prize, a cool $546,200 payoff.

Raul Clavero, 27, a mechanic living in the Madrid suburb of Leganes, then realized that four other members of his family had also bought tickets with the same winning numbers.

Millions of Spaniards had been glued to their televisions as $3.4 billion in prize money was distributed in a four-hour TV show.

Unlike lotteries that offer one large jackpot, Spain's yuletide drawing sprinkles a variety of winnings on thousands of ticketholders.

Tales of joy and celebration were widely broadcast on TV stations, providing Spain's struggling population a rare moment of joy after another year of a brutal financial crisis.

Before Spain's property-led economic boom imploded in 2008, ticket buyers often talked about spending their winnings on new cars, beach homes or fancy vacations.

Now many Spaniards are just hoping to avoid having their homes or cars repossessed.

'We jumped out of bed and ran out,' Clavero said, still looking shell-shocked two hours later. He added that he would 'pay the mortgage, that's the first thing, and then just enjoy the rest.'

Winning El Gordo tickets this year were sold in at least eight locations throughout the country, including Madrid, Barcelona and the northern industrial city of Modragon, where electrical appliance manufacturer Fagor Electrodomesticos filed for bankruptcy in October.

The second-best number netted winners $170,700 and all these tickets - worth $1.7 million - were sold in the town of Granadilla de Abona on the Canary Island resort of Tenerife.

The lottery had one change this year. For the first time, the tax man will claim 20 percent of winnings above $3,400, as the Spanish government strives to right an economy saddled with sky-high unemployment of 26 per cent.
