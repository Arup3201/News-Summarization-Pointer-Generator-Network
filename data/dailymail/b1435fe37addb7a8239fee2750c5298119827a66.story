The BBC has apologised  after the sister of murdered schoolgirl Alice Gross branded its flagship Question Time programme 'exceptionally insensitive'.

Nina Gross, 19, angrily accused the broadcaster of allowing 'political agendas' to exploit a family tragedy.

She provoked a huge swell of support after denouncing what she called a 'horrible' discussion on the current affairs show.

Amid a flurry of messages, she said: 'This is a personal tragedy which we want to deal with privately, rather than fearing anyone using it for any political agenda.'

The storm forced the BBC to apologise, first in a message to the teenager and later in a contrite public statement. 

A spokesman said the matter was only discussed after careful consideration but offered the broadcaster's profound apologies.

Scotland Yard detectives continue to work around the clock to trace Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns, the 41-year-old prime suspect for the murder of Alice.

The discovery of the 14-year-old's body wrapped in plastic and buried under logs in a West London river earlier this week confirmed her family's worst fears.

The case has sparked controversy across Europe after it emerged that Zalkalns is a convicted murderer who has roamed freely across European Union borders.

On Thursday evening, a member of the audience asked the Question Time panel if convicted criminals should be allowed unrestricted movement.

Alice went missing from her home on August 28 and police launched a murder investigation this week after her body was discovered in the River Brent. Officers said 'significant efforts' had been made to conceal it

Referring to Zalkalns, host David Dimbleby said: 'This is, of course, referring to the hideous murder of Alice Gross and the person who is being sought, who is a convicted murderer from Latvia.'

Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert said: 'There was a catastrophic failure in this case, he should never have been allowed to come in. There is a computer system that's supposed to sort this out and for some reason it didn't happen.'

He said the UK should work more closely with other countries and encourage information sharing to better understand who might be entering Britain.

He then added: 'We have to know who are the people that really shouldn't be coming in – let's keep them out.'

Nina Gross took to Twitter last night to condemn the BBC for using her sister's death for 'political agendas'

Panellist Grant Shapps, the Tory Party chairman, said: 'The case about that specific individual is horrendous. The news coverage is appalling and of course we should be able to control our own borders.

'We do, fortunately, have some control over our borders and I think there is a very strong case to be looked at here in terms of the seriousness of the crime. It's also another reason why we want to renegotiate with the EU over things like border control.'

Within minutes of the comments, Nina sent a series of messages on Twitter attacking the broadcaster.

She said: 'Now is not the time for these discussions; it is exceptionally insensitive to talk about these issues at this time.'

She added: 'In future, please respect our wishes as we grieve. This is a personal tragedy which we want to deal with privately, rather than fearing anyone using it for any political agenda.' Hundreds of social media users also condemned the BBC's coverage and called for complaints to be made to Ofcom.

Luke Adar wrote: 'Filled out a full complaint to the BBC, very disappointed that they found it appropriate to use this as a debate topic.'

Alice's family had earlier appealed for privacy in which to grieve following the discovery of Alice's body. Her parents Jose Gross, 60, and Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said: 'This is a time for grieving and not a time for anger or recriminations.'

Further tests are being carried out on Alice's body to find out how she died after a six-hour post mortem examination proved inconclusive.

Forensic experts are also examining her clothes and materials used to conceal her body in the Brent River in the hope of recovering evidence. She vanished while walking home on September 28.

In its apology, the BBC said: 'We applied careful and due consideration to our choice of question and attempted to deal with this matter as sensitively as possible.'
