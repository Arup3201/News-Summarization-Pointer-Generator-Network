Rory McIlroy, the world's No 1 golfer, experienced an awkward moment when he went to watch Ulster take on Connacht in a rugby match on Friday.

The Ulster supporter was in the middle of a television interview with the BBC when the Neil Diamond song 'Sweet Caroline' was played over the public address system at half-time.

McIlroy responded by smiling sheepishly, looking down at the ground and exclaiming 'Oh dear'.

The Northern Irishman broke off his engagement to former world number one tennis player Caroline Wozniacki in May, the same week as he won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.

McIlroy went on to score a rare title hat-trick later in the season, reeling off three straight victories in the British Open at Royal Liverpool, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio and the U.S. PGA Championship in Kentucky.

The 25-year-old is having some time off before returning to competitive golf in the new year.

'I'm in my off-season so I can enjoy myself, enjoy my Christmas dinner and have a few drinks,' said McIlroy with a big grin.

As for the match itself, the hosts got back to winning ways in the Guinness PRO12 and moved up one place to fourth but they were made to scrap every inch of the way against Connacht.

Pat Lam's visitors could have even snatched their first win in Belfast since 1960, but a tight and fairly dire affair ended 13-10 in the hosts' favour.

The entire game on a wet and cold night saw just two tries, with Ulster winger Craig Gilroy getting over in the first half and then Connacht second row Aly Muldowney crashing over in the second 40 minutes.

Ulster had led 10-3 at the break, but the westerners came back and, although they made off with a losing bonus point, will be rightly disappointed at not getting more from this one in a game which saw both sides missing front-line Ireland players who had been rested.

The result halted Ulster's losing run of having been beaten in three of their previous four games, and got Neil Doak's men back on track towards their aim of making the play-offs - even though the performance was well short of where it should have been.
