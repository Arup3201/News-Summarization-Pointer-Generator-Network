Vicente del Bosque has demanded a reaction from his Spanish side after the world champions were humbled 5-1 by Holland in their World Cup opener.

Del Bosque's side, in a replay of the 2010 final, looked a shadow of their usual selves after going ahead in the 26th minute with a Xabi Alonso penalty.

But Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben got two apiece before Stefan de Vrij sealed it with a fifth as the Netherlands put FIFA's top-ranked team to shame.

Down but not out: Vicente del Bosque says Spain must show a reaction when they face Chile

Frustrated: Diego Costa won the penalty in the first half that gave Spain the lead but couldn't inspire a win

Hurt: Spain couldn't keep hold of their lead after Xabi Alonso put his penalty away in the first half

It got Holland off to the best possible start, and Spain the worst.

Del Bosque, though, refuses to accept the top spot in Group B is done and dusted just yet, and knows that is the nature of the game.

'It's sport, we lost. It is necessary to accept defeat,' he told Tele 5.

'We must recognise our mistakes, but everyone fought for a better result.

'I am aware that it is a very delicate time for us.

'Together we have to try to solve it for the next match against Chile and look for the win.'

Del Bosque then suggested David Silva's missed chance - an audacious chip from the Manchester City midfielder - before Holland's equaliser was crucial to the match.

'They played better in the second half, but we dominated in the first and went from possibly 2-0 possible with Silva to 1-1 immediately,' he said.

Minimal: Substitute Fernando Torres couldn't inspire Spain back into the game after replacing Costa
