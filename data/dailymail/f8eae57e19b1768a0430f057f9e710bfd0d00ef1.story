Politicians, celebrities, business leaders and cultural icons are alleged to be at the heart of the corruption and tax dodging that is rampant in Greece.

There is massive pressure on the country to clean up its act to stave off bankruptcy and stay in the euro.

But tax records exposed in Germany show incredible fiddling while the country's finances burn.

One individual who declared an annual income of £21,000 siphoned £45 million into foreign banks.

Politicians and celebrities are on a 54,000 strong list of people linked to Greek corruption. Here protesting journalists shout slogans and carry a banner reading 'Don't let those trying to eat you fill their bellies'

Another, who declared less than £4,000 in 2010, deposited an astonishing £17 million pounds offshore.

A third person claimed to have no income the same year - but sent more than £6 million overseas.

Investigators from 'troika' - the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the

European Central Bank - are tasked with getting Greece to knuckle down.

It has pledged to implement reforms to put an end to the criminality.

German press reports claim there are 54,000 people on lists being studied by the Greek Finance Ministry.

Their tax returns are said to bear no resemblance to their actual finances.

Celebrities, politicians, business leaders and cultural figureheads are all mentioned - as well as details of 1,991 known Swiss bank accounts.

Greece's Financial and Economic Crime Unit, the SDOE, has not acted on information supplied by overseas banks to the IMF.

Now Germany's Spiegel magazine has claimed at least 60 politicians - who are meant to be getting Greece out of the mire - are among tax cheats.

High-ranking former ministers are among those suspected of involvement in bogus transactions and money-laundering.

The former prefect of Thessaloniki city, Panagiotis Psomiadis, is alleged to have received nearly €1 million - more than £810,000 - for public works projects that were never built.

He is also suspected of being connected with a mafia ring of loan sharks.

Transparency International Greece chairman, Costas Bakouris, believes the country is 'very bad now as a society'. These men and women were among those queueing to be fed in Athens today.

Costas Bakouris is chairman of Transparency International Greece.

The 75-year-old said: 'We are very bad now as a society. We have become bad. We are greedy and asocial.'

'Now that it's clear that the creditors will continue to pay, people are turning a blind eye to the inevitable'.

He claimed an 'incompetent political class' continued to rule Greece.

According to Spiegel, investigators even discovered €2.8 million - more than £2.2 million - in an account belonging to the deputy mayor of a town of 14,000 people in Greece's Thessaly region.

None was declared.

'The man receives a monthly salary of approximately €1,500,' said the magazine.

The troika is aghast that the IKA, Greece's social security agency, has been used as 'personal piggy bank' by managers.

Funds intended for the poor have been paid to family, friends and themselves.

Of 700 people registered blind on the island of Zakynthos only 60 are genuine.

Money for bogus claims has been siphoned off by crooks in the IKA.

Bakouris claimed Greece had 'all the right conditions for corruption'.

He said there was 'plenty of bureaucracy, no functioning justice system, laws with numerous loopholes and economic pressure.'

Only one senior politician is so far facing corruption charges.

Ex-defence minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos has been in jail awaiting trial for the past six months.

He is alleged to have accepted millions of euros in kickbacks for projects.
