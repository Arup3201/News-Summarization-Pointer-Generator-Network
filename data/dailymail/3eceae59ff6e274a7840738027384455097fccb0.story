'I will attend the game in the stadium but I won't play - I haven't done anything in the previous weeks expect jumping with my children on the trampoline.

'I still have one year left [on my contract] and I understand Aston Villa absolutely don't want to let me go.

'In the last few weeks, I haven't even thought about a possible transfer. The only thing I did was enjoy my holiday and I didn't think about football. Soon I will meet my agent and discuss the various options.'

Tottenham also have an interest in Vlaar while Villa want to offer the centre-back a new contract.
