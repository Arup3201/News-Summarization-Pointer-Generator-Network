Team news

Liverpool 

Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge will miss the visit of Aston Villa as he could be sidelined for up to three weeks with a thigh strain sustained while with England.

Strike partner Mario Balotelli is  a doubt having not trained on Thursday or Friday due to illness and has been kept away from team-mates to prevent further Reds stars from falling ill.

Midfielder Emre Can is another international duty casualty as he has been ruled out for six weeks with an ankle injury while fellow midfielder Joe Allen returned from playing for Wales with a knee problem which needs to be assessed.
