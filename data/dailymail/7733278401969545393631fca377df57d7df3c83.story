The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were gripped with Wimbledon fever this afternoon as they watched Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer in the men's final.

The royal couple were sitting in the Royal Box with David and Victoria Beckham, as well as a host of Hollywood stars including Bradley Cooper, Samuel L Jackson, Hugh Jackman and Orlando Bloom, as tennis aces Federer and Djokovic battled it out to be crowned king of SW19. 

After a gripping and competitive match, which was closely fought, Djokovic was crowned the eventual winner in the fifth set - his second Wimbledon championship win. It means the Serbian reclaims the World No.1 title - overtaking Rafael Nadal - while Federer moves up to third.

The win was watched by countless famous faces including cyclist Sir Chris Hoy and his wife Sarra - who took their seats to watch the Centre Court action from the exclusive royal enclosure - and the Duchess of Cambridge's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, her sister Pippa and her boyfriend Nico Jackson who were seated in a separate area in the corner of the stands.

It was Kate and William's second day out at the All England Club this week, after the pair watched Murray crash out of the Grand Slam on Wednesday.

It was also David Beckham's second time in the Royal Box after he and his mother Sandra were among the celebrated sporting guests last Saturday.

Yesterday, Petra Kvitova  proved she is no one-hit wonder by winning the women's singles. 

The Czech produced a stunning performance to defeat Eugenie Bouchard 6-3 6-0, lifting the Venus Rosewater Dish again three years after first holding it aloft.

Kvitova became the first Wimbledon champion to make use of a new gate which enabled her to celebrate with her loved ones without climbing on to the commentary box roof.

She fought back tears of joy during her post-victory interview, saying: 'I just really wanted to be here again with the trophy.'

The
 24-year-old became emotional as she paid tribute to her family, and as 
the camera turned to her father, the proud father looked on in tears.
