A massive search is underway across the Idaho wilderness for a 21-year-old student after he failed to turn up for his first day of college.

After finishing his summer job in Horseshoe Bend, Idaho last Tuesday, Lucius Robbi, packed up his car and set off for the University of Montana to arrive in time for orientation for his junior year.

The outdoor enthusiast had tied two orange kayaks to the top of his green 1997 Subaru Legacy and told relatives and friends he intended to drive for a while before pulling over to explore the area.

Surveillance footage apparently shows his car carrying kayaks as it passed a gas station in Garden Valley, Idaho about 20 minutes after he left Horseshoe Bend on Tuesday,ABC News reported.

Have you seen him? Lucius Robbi, 21, left Horseshoe Bend in Idaho last Tuesday but never arrived at the University of Montana. A massive search is now underway for the adventurous student

Vehicle: Robbi drives a green 1997 Subaru Legacy, pictured, and had attached two kayaks to the top

The last ping from his cellphone was detected in the nearby town of Lowman on Tuesday afternoon - but no one has heard from him since.

'We're very, very worried at this point,' his father Marc Robbi told ABC.

His family became concerned when he failed to turn up for the orientation and contacted the Boise County Sheriff's Office. Nearby counties have also been notified.

Search teams, including Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue, as well as friends and family, are now scouring the vast area, but so far, no further traces of him have been found. 

Searchers believe they came across footage of his car passing the gas station, although the New York Daily News reported that it only appears as if there is one kayak on top of the car. 

Location: A map shows where he was last seen in Idaho compared to his destination in Missoula, Montana

Active: Robbi, pictured, had worked in Idaho as a raft and kayak guide  for the past two summers

Adventurous: Friends and relatives said he planned to camp along the route to university last week

'The mother says that's his car,' Chief Deputy Dale Rogers of the Boise County Sheriff's Office said. 'We'll go with that. My view is I didn't see two kayaks. I would probably be wondering if it was his car.'  

Robbi, who is from Orleans, California, has worked as a guide for Cascade Raft and Kayak in Horseshoe Bend for the past two summers and enjoys other extreme sports, including snowboarding.

His mother Tina Glaessner explained: 'If anyone can survive out there for seven days, he can do it.'

Kenneth Long, Robbi's supervisor at Cascade Raft and Kayak, told the Idaho Statesman that he had talked about camping along the way. His coworkers have driven along the route but have seen nothing.

'This is a very troubling and odd situation,' Long said.

Spotted: Surveillance footage outside a gas station about 20 minutes into his journey shows his car, with the kayak attached, passing by last Tuesday. His cell phone was also detected shortly afterwards

Concerns: His father Marc told ABC News that he was extremely worried about his 21-year-old son

It is unknown which route Robbi took, but possibilities include Highway 21 to Stanley, Highway 75 to Challis, Highway 93 to Montana or Highway 55 to Orofino and Highway 12 to Montana, the Statesman reported.

Robbi is driving a green 1997 Subaru Legacy with California license plates: 6 CCP 540. The car could have one or two kayaks on top.

Anyone with information is urged to contact the Boise County Sheriff’s Office at (208) 392-4411.

Friends have also launched a gofundme page to raise money for the search.
