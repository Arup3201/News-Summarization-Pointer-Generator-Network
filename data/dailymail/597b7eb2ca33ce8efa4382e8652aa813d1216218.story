An incredibly rare albino dolphin was filmed near the Florida coast hunting for its dinner.

The albino bottlenose, thought to be an adolescent, was seen poking its dorsal fin above the water several times in the Indian River Lagoon, by the east coast of the state.

A few seconds later it exposes more of its body - and briefly crests the surface with its nose - before swimming away with a regular-colored gray bottlenose.

The sighting, by a volunteer with the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, is only the fifteenth recorded sighting since records began in 1962. Some researchers believe there are only 20 albino dolphins on the planet.

Danielle Carter filmed the creature swimming not far from the shore on December 10, and the footage was uploaded to YouTube by the institute just over a week later. It has reportedly been seen again in the area since.

According to Live Science, the animal's behavior implies that it was hunting fish during the filming. The news site said that the Indian River waters are ideal for catching sea trout, pinfish and mullet.

Albinism has been observed in more than 20 speices of oceangoing mammals, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), but appears to be rare in dolphins.

Animals with the genetic trait are not believed to be inherently weaker or less capable than regular dolphins, though their color can make them easier targets for predators.

Dolphins with especially severe albino traits can sometimes suffer from impaired vision - though the rarity of the creatures means that extensive research is yet to be carried out, and theories often have to be extrapolated from albino humans.

Although rare, the white dolphins often capture the imaginations of marine enthusiasts. Sightings of a baby albino off the Louisiana coast in 2007 caused a flurry of excitement, as did an adult albino, who was found swimming in the Mediterranean, near Italy, last summer.
