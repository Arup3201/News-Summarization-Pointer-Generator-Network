Roger Federer has been declared fit for the start of the Davis Cup final on Friday but his wife Mirka is likely to miss the occasion.

According to event officials Mrs. Federer might not be at the match, which sees Switzerland trying to win tennis’s premier team competition for the first time when they tackle France.

Mirka Federer caused a major fallout with her husband’s team-mate Stan Wawrinka at the 02 Arena last Saturday night when she heckled him during the two players’ feisty semi-final.

Although they are now on the same side – and said to have made their peace after a furious row between them that followed the match – the decision heads off any possibility that her presence might be a distraction.

Federer practised Thursday morning on the clay court laid at Lille’s football stadium and said he was fit enough to play in the three-day match, which could involve two singles and a doubles.

At Thursday lunchtime’s draw, the two teams for Friday were confirmed with Federer playing the second match against Monfils, while Wawrinka will tackle Tsonga in the opening rubber.

In the doubles Benneteau and Richard Gasquet were named to take on Marco Chudinelli and Michael Lammer , although these can be changed by the two Captains on Saturday morning, and it is likely to depend on the state of play tomorrow night. The reverse singles will be played on Sunday.

Federer only started practising late Wednesday afternoon, having been forced out of the final of the Barclays ATP World Finals with an unspecified back injury.
