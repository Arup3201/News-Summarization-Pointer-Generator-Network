Fighting it: Tranmere Rovers footballer Joe Thompson and his girlfriend Chantelle Perry

When professional footballer Joe Thompson was hit by fatigue and discovered a lump in his neck his club's doctor urged him to get it checked out.

The super-fit 24-year-old from Prestwich, feared he had glandular fever or an infection so was stunned when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

Mr Thompson, who plays for League One side Tranmere Rovers said: 'The moment I found out I had cancer I was just in complete shock.

'I genuinely thought it would have 
just been an infection or glandular fever - it caught me off guard. I 
mean I'm only 24 and I couldn't believe it was happening to me, I 
honestly thought I was invincible, I eat healthily and exercise and I 
don't really drink.

But 
after I found out it all clicked into place, the symptoms of that type 
of cancer were exactly what I'd had. The tiredness is like no other, 
it's not just a long day or a big work-out at the gym.

'I have to admit though, I was relieved to just have finally found out what was wrong with me.

'What
 was comforting was that the doctors immediately said that if you had to
 pick a cancer this would be it as it has such a high survival rate.

'It's just the 'c' word though isn't it, it's so scary, and we didn't really know many people who had been treated for it before.'

After being diagnosed in October, Mr Thompson was transferred to The Christie Hospital in Manchester.

He was then asked if he wanted to take part in the pioneering research trial of a new antibody drug, being led by Professor John Radford.

With the support of his girlfriend, Chantelle Perry, 27, and their 15-month-old daughter Thailula, as well as footballers from across the leagues, Mr Thompson is determined to beat the disease.

He said: 'It's definitely going to be a challenge and of course I get really down some days but what I need is people around me to take my mind off it because if I'm on my own for too long I just think about everything too much.

'I have my loved ones to keep me strong and I'm so lucky to have such a fantastic family.

'As a family we're all really close. On the day I was told I had cancer my daughter just instinctively knew there was something up and she wouldn't stop crying. It was so strange because the moment the doctor told us she knew something was wrong.

'I guess she just knew there was a twinkle in daddy's eye which wasn't there anymore. We all slept crammed on the sofa together that night because Lula wouldn't settle and she usually goes to sleep like clockwork.'

He added that trialling the new drug is giving him an extra boost as he prepares to undergo a six-month course of treatment and chemotherapy.

He said: 'Now I'm feeling very positive about the new research trial and after I had weighed up the pros and cons it was just a no-brainer really. 

'It was just fortunate that the doctor was based at Christie's and I lived in Manchester.'

Since Joe's news became public, family and friends have rallied around to provide support for the family.

And sports stars including , United legend Bryan Robson, former Aston Villa star Stan Petrov, coach Alan Stubbs, ex-referee Mark Halsey and tennis player Ross Hutchins, who have all experienced living with cancer, have all sent messages of support to him.

Mr Thompson said: 'It definitely made me feel so much more positive hearing from stars such as these. 

'They have all been so nice and inspiring to me at such a difficult time.

'Bryan just told me to remain positive as half of the battle is in the mind. Their words have really helped me get through these past few months.

'Mark Halsey got in touch with me and sent me a book with a note saying you'll no doubt have days when you're tired and just want to chill so read this.

'I have got all of their numbers and they said I can contact them whenever I need to chat, don't feel any reluctancy and they'll be there to help.

'Everybody has just been so fantastic though, it was a shock but my family and teammates have all been there for me and it means so much.'

Mr Thompson, who has played professionally for more than seven years and used to play for Rochdale, has high hopes of returning to training next season. 

He and Chantelle are doing everything they can to improve his fitness. 

And the couple are determined to raise awareness of the condition and to raise as much money as possible for The Christie.

Mr Thompson said: 'There are so many success stories out there you wouldn't believe it.

'At first I got a little selfish and didn't want to talk about it. But now I know there is no point in hiding away, I'm not going to be reserved and I want to help others in a similar situation as much as I can.'
