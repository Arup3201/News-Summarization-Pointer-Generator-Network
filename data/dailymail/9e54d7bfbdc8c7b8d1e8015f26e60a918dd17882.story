England football fans heading to Brazil for the World Cup could be able to get a taste of home as a chef negotiates the rights to sell fish and chips.

Mario Freitas Do Valle is in talks with FIFA to sell the traditional dish at the 46,000-seater stadium where England will play their first fixture against Italy.

The Brazilian chef said he fell in love with Britain's favourite meal on a visit to Aberdeen in 2001, adding he will also be putting Scottish favourite, deep-fried Mars bar, on his menu.

Now he's negotiating a deal with FIFA to sell fish suppers at Arena da Amazonia in Manaus, and wants to serve them up in special cones in team colours priced at £2.

He already has queues of tourists and locals outside his restaurant wanting to try the dish.

Mario – known locally as Super Mario - said: ‘The people who are coming here will love them.‘The fish and chips are a bit different from the ones in Britain but they are becoming just as popular.

‘We have had lines of people out of the door coming to try them in our restaurant and we expect there will be 4,000 fans eating them at every game.’

Instead of cod or haddock, Mario uses tabaqui, an Amazonian fish, and cuts it in half, then grills it before deep-frying it in batter.

He already sells eight tonnes a month through different outlets in Brazil.

Mario, the first Brazilian member of the National Federation of Fish Friers (NFFF) said: 'We didn't have fish and chips in Brazil.

‘In Manaus, restaurants selling fish were either really expensive or really cheap - and not safe to eat in.

‘But I remembered Aberdeen and the fish and chips I had and thought it would work.‘It has really taken off.’

England boss Roy Hodgson gave the fish and chips the thumbs up when he visited Mario's restaurant last month with Alex Ellis, the UK's Ambassador to Brazil.

Mario said: ‘They came to see the stadium and how everything was going for the World Cup and they tried them.

‘Roy Hodgson said they were a bit different from the ones in Croydon, where he grew up, because they had less vinegar and didn't come with mushy peas. But he really liked them.

‘I think the England fans will be in for an amazing surprise when they come here for the first match against Italy on June 13.

‘I hope they win the match but it is our home tournament and everyone is football mad in Brazil and we won't accept second place.’

Andrew Crook, NFFF secretary joked: ‘It will probably take more than good fish and chips for England to win.’
