Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg faced the media after Belgium Grand Prix crash

Lewis Hamilton said trust is not something he applies to motor racing after being asked about his relationship with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg going forward following the controversial incident involving the two at the Belgian Grand Prix. 

Hamilton's race at Spa was wrecked after the front right-wing of Rosberg's car hit his left-rear tyre, resulting in the Briton suffering a puncture.

Hamilton, who later claimed the German's actions were intentional, was eventually forced to retire late on in the race, while Rosberg went on to finish second and subsequently move 29 points clear of his rival in the fight for the title.

When asked if there was a base of trust and understanding for the two team-mates to be able to work together from here, Hamilton said on Thursday: 'Trust is a big word and that's not really something that I would particularly apply to racing on the track.

'Nico and me, we've been racing for a long time and I think we set a good foundation a long long time ago so that's what we work from.'

Hamilton also seemed keen not to dwell on the incident, saying he was looking forward to this weekend's race at Monza.

Making his point: Hamilton was in an animated mood during the press conference on Thursday 

He added at a press conference: 'It's not in my mind. I'm really excited about moving forwards, really energetic, had a good couple of days break last week and excited to be here, this is one of my favourite circuits.

'I hope that we can have a good weekend.' On his own future, Hamilton added: 'We are constantly talking with the team. I still have a contract for a whole year on top of this one. I see my future with Mercedes. I am really happy there.'

Rosberg, meanwhile, admitted he was not proud of the incident at Spa.

'In Spa definitely I was not proud of the way it went because in general I really want to contribute to my sport, because I want it to be the most entertaining sport in the world,' he said.

'And if I am able contribute to that in many ways throughout the season then I'm very happy, and I'm sure in many ways we have.'

Mercedes took 'suitable disciplinary measures' against Rosberg following the Belgian Grand Prix, hitting the German with a six-figure fine.

Hamilton confirmed on Thursday that there were no threats of punishment from the Brackley-based marque hanging over either him and Rosberg going forward - or orders not to challenge each other on the track.

He told Sky Sports: 'There's none of that, we're free to race and I think that it's just very clear that they don't want what happened in the last race to happen.

'So it's just another normal weekend for me and we're just going to be pushing ourselves to move forwards.'

Rosberg, who has apologised for the incident at Spa, was jeered on the podium at the end of the race but hopes to avoid a repeat from British racing fans if he finishes in the top three in Italy this weekend.

He told Sky Sports: 'I hope they accept my apology with time. I fully understand they were not happy in Spa because they came a long way to see a great race and it didn't happen, so I hope that with time they can enjoy the battle we're having.'
