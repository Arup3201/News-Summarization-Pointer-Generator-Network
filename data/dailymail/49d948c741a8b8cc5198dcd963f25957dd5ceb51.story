A family has been miraculously 
reunited with a lost digital camera and over 800 precious pictures on it by
the dedicated diver that sought them out after finding it sitting on 
the seabed.

Paul McGahan, 47,
a music producer from Helford in Cornwall, was stunned after being 
handed the camera and memory card nearly two months after his daughter 
accidentally dropped it overboard on a yacht trip on July 25.

Incredibly
it was found by local diver Diver Mark Milburn 
carrying out an underwater beach clean off Falmouth, Cornwall.

Lost and found: Paul and Rachel pictured with Maddie, 10, and Myia, five, with the Samsung camera saved from the sea after it was discovered by divers 30ft under the water. They have recovered their 800 family snaps

He
worked to save the pictures on the Samsung camera’s memory card and 
found the photographs included a family holiday in Florida, a school 
concert and a sailing holiday on the Helford river in Cornwall.

Now
after an appeal by Mr Milburn who runs the Atlantic Scuba diving centre
in Falmouth the family has been reunited with the photos.

Mr McGahan, married to Rachel, 35, and children Rosie, 18, Branden, 15, Maddie, 10 and Myia, 5, couldn’t believe it.

Amongst rubbish: Mark Milburn, pictured, found the camera amongst 66lb 
rubbish he collected with local divers in an underwater beach clean and amazingly discovered it was still working

Discovery: Divers in Cornwall are pictured with some of the rubbish they found on their underwater beach clean

He said: 'It’s just amazing - what a chain of events - you couldn’t make it up. It’s beyond belief really.

'There are over 800 family snaps on there. I never thought I’d see them again.

'I
mean we can go on holidays again and take pictures of that but there 
were some pictures of my youngest daughter’s first school play on there.

'They were irreplaceable - we couldn’t replicate that. I’m just so grateful to Mark and his fellow divers.

Miraculously survived: One of the family photos on the camera. Mr Milburn recognised the Helford River in the background. He worked out dates on the images showed they were taken just two days before he found it

Family snap: This photo was also retrieved from the abandoned camera, along with more than 800 others after Mr Milburn dried the camera out and left stunned to find the memory card still working

Return memories: Mr Milburn is happy the camera has finally been returned and memories have been saved

'He’s done a great job - he put a lot of effort into retrieving the photos from the card. It’s down to him really.'

He added that camera was accidentally dropped overboard when the family went on a trip aboard a friend’s yacht.

'My
daughter Maddie wanted to take a picture of us but the yacht went over 
wake wave just as she was taking it and the camera bounced out of her 
hand.

'It was just one of those things - I definitely never expected to see it again though.'

He said he would be getting in touch with Samsung and also Sandisk the makers of the camera memory card about the story.

Mr Milburn added he was delighted to have returned the camera and photos to its rightful owners.

'It’s fantastic to help out,' he said.

'I’m just happy they got it back. It’s a happy ending which I’m really glad about.'

He said: 'I was on a routine dive when I spotted this small shiny box on the bed.

'I thought it was a camera case at first but when I picked it up and it was an actual camera.

'Obviously I figured the sea water 
would have done irreparable damage. I got back home and dried it out and
when the memory card popped out there were all these photos on there.

The lost camera: It was found 30ft underwater by Mr Milburn while he was diving and still worked

‘The pictures seemed to show family holidays around the world.

'Some look like Universal Studios in America and there’s some local stuff as well.'

Mr McGahan added: 'All the memories we thought were gone have now been brought back to us.'

Mr McGahan was on a day’s sailing trip on a friend’s yacht in July when Maddie dropped the camera.

Found 30ft underwater: This photo of Darth Vader and other performers at a theme park in Florida was found

He said: 'Maddie was properly distraught and although I told her it was just an accident, she was in tears.'

Mr
McGahan said the camera held all their recent photographs of a trip to 
the Harry Potter theme park in Florida, which he had not downloaded.

'The
camera can be replaced, but our cherished memories can’t, so Rachel and
I are convinced someone’s been watching over us,' he said.

Mrs McGahan was at work at RNAS Culdrose when she saw the Spotlight story on the guard room television.

Lost memories: Taken in a school hall, this photo was an important moment for the family which could have been lost

At theme park: Among the photos found were some holiday snaps at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park in Florida
