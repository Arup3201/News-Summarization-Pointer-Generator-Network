Fabrice Muamba came back from the dead once more on Saturday night - but thankfully, this time it was just for Halloween.

Muamba showed that he is ready to joke about his 2012 collapse on the football pitch, which saw his heart stop for 78 minutes, as he dressed as a zombie groom.

The retired footballer, 26, and his wife Shauna even posed behind a tombstone with 'Will B Back' written on it. 

Kept his promise: Fabrice Muamba and his wife Shauna dressed as a zombie bride and groom for Emile Heskey's wife's Halloween party on Saturday

Muamba and Shauna wore their tongue-in-cheek zombie wedding outfits to  Emile Heskey's wife Chantelle's Charity One Foundation ball in Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

It has been more than two years since Muamba's real-life return from the dead after suffering a cardiac arrest during a football match between Bolton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspurs. 

Millions of horrified football fans watched as Muamba collapsed 41 minutes into the televised FA Cup Quarter Final clash at White Hart Lane on March 17, 2012.

Medics battled to save the footballer for 78 minutes both on the pitch and in hospital before they managed to get his heart beating again.

In the days that followed, football fans and players from teams around the world, united in support for Muamba, sending messages of support to the star. 

The 26-year-old made a miracle recovery, but after having a pacemaker fitted, he has been forced to retire from professional football.

He married Shauna, whom he had gotten engaged to a month before his collapse, in October that same year.

Shauna, an entrepreneur who runs Mrs Muamba's, a line of Caribbean cooking sauces, gave birth to their second son last year.

Muamba is currently studying for a degree in journalism at Staffordshire University and hopes to embark on a career in sports journalism.
