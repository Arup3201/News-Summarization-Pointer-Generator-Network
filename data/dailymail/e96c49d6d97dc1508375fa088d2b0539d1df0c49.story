Surgery addict Alicia Douvall shed her 
bandages today to appear on This Morning and reveal that she repeatedly lied to 
family and friends to fund her obsession with cosmetic surgery.

Last week the ex glamour model was spotted with a swollen and bloody face, the result of of a traumatic operation to have all her facial 
implants removed in a last ditch bid to save her looks and return her ability to smile.

Today, the 34-year-old who has had more than 350 procedures, admitted that she had been warned to stop but that her quest for the perfect body and face was all consuming.

Alicia Douvall appeared on This Morning to talk about the dangers of excessive plastic surgery

She said: 'Yes, plastic surgery 
became an addiction, obsession, however you want to say it ... I worked
 just to pay for surgery.

'People always questioned me, my family and friends were very upset but at that point I wasn't going to stop. 

'I persuaded boyfriends to pay for treatment. I lied to get the money just like a drug addict would.'

Mother-of-two Alicia first went under the knife aged 17, lying to the surgeons about her age so that they would operate on her.

Since then she has spent over £1million on six 
nose jobs, 11 procedures on the skin around her eyes, cheek implants 
(both adding and removal) and a facelift as well as having a rib shortened to give her a slimmer silhouette, her toes
shortened ‘so they looked better in heels’, a tummy tuck, bottom 
implants, chin implants and 16 breast augmentations.

She admitted herself to a 
rehabilitation centre in Miami twice to try in an effort to stem her 
surgery addiction, where she says she was the first case of her kind: 'I
 was the first person to go in to rehab for plastic surgery addiction, 
but they treated me like an alcoholic or drug addict.

The model is urging women to avoid plastic surgery as she reveals that her addiction left her face so botched she couldn't even smile at her newborn baby

On Monday the
 heartbroken blonde revealed that her face had been so damaged from too 
much surgery that she hasn't been able to smile at her baby daughter 
Papaya since she gave birth 
in 2011.

Alicia has two daughters, Georgia, 17, and 16-month-old Papaya. She told The Sun: 'Imagine holding 
your baby daughter for the for the first time and not being able to 
smile.

'I have been so selfish. Now my dream is for Papaya one day to see her mummy smile back at her for the first time.'

In a bid to fix her smile Alicia, who
 has declared that she will not have any more surgery unless it is 
corrective, underwent a painful procedure that involved 
breaking her jaw and nose and having her ears cut off last week.

Last week she was seen with a swollen, bloodied face which was the result of a corrective operation to remove all of her facial implants

Alicia lays the blame for her 
addiction firmly at the feet of the surgeons who continued to operate on
 her despite the obvious signs of Body Dysmorphic Disorder.

She told host Holly: 'I am angry with
 the surgeons that have done this to me. I wish they had offered me 
counselling. I lied about my age, but  I was a young girl and they 
didn't need to put me on that path.

'You are playing with people's faces and
 you are damaging their looks. I was a model, looks are everything to 
me. There are instances of people taking their own lives and I have felt
 like that at times. I have thought I can't take this any more, I can't 
live like this.

The glamour girl started having plastic surgery aged 17 and has spent over £1million on her addiction

Comparing herself to Katie Piper, the former model who was disfigured in an acid 
attack, glamour girl Alicia says that her life has been ruined by 'attackers in white 
coats'.

She says that she was blinded by the predatory surgeons who promised she would look 
'perfect' but instead turned her in to a walking sideshow: 'I often used that word. I took a Barbie doll to one medical consultation to show 
them exactly what I was after.

'I
 was unwell; addicted to surgery. But none of those doctors tried to 
stop me. I think they just wanted my money.'

Alicia, seen in 2001 (left) and photographed at home in London in March 2013 (right), has undergone over 350 operations including one to have her toes shortened

Alicia needs to have one more corrective operation to stop her face drooping, but she is urging other women never to have plastic surgery just to make themselves look better

She added: 'I wouldn't let my daughters have surgery. They are beautiful just the
 way they are. Don't let your children have surgery, youth is beautiful 
in itself, spend any spare cash you have on counselling (if they ask for a boob job), 
work on telling them how beautiful they are.'

Cosmetic surgeon Dr Angelica Kavouni also appeared on This Morning, and said: 'A surgeon has to make sure that the patient is having surgery for the right motives, but it's not easy, a lot of patients lie about their medical history.

'Most surgeons do pick up telltale signs of dysmorphia and there are strict guidelines. I'm sorry that it didn't happen in this instance.

'But it is an industry, there are lots of commercial practices with no continuity of care. It's not medicine, it's business, big business.'
