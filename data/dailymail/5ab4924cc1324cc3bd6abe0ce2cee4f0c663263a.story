One of the three women allegedly held as a slave by a Maoist sect in south London is the daughter of one of the greatest Bletchley Park codebreakers, it has emerged.

The father of Josephine Herivel, 57, was John Herivel, who was instrumental in deciphering the Nazis' Enigma code during World War Two.

But by the time he died two years ago, she was apparently estranged from the family after becoming a radical Leftist in the 1970s and being arrested for assault.

Reports suggest that last week's arrests of suspect Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife Chanda in Brixton were triggered when Ms Herivel raised the alarm.

The couple were arrested on suspicion of assault, false imprisonment and immigration offences amid claims that three women were held against their will for more than 30 years.

The women are set to be formally interviewed by police today - officers have already had indirect contact with the trio, but had to wait until trauma experts gave them permission to talk to them in person.

Commander Steve Rodhouse said: 'We have not yet been able to formally interview the victims in this case so we don't fully understand the nature of the allegations.

'We are moving to a point where we will be able to interview the victims and our plan is actually to do so today.

'The victims are in the care of specialists who have got great experience of dealing with people who have been subject to trauma. We're working to that advice of those experts as to how best to handle those victims, to support them and of course to draw out the evidence we would need to substantiate any prosecution.'

He said that there may have been 'many 
and varied offences' against the women, who were allegedly held captive 
at various addresses in London, but that their ordeal may not be defined
as slavery.

Ms Herivel was brought up near Belfast’s so-called 'millionaire row' with her two sisters, Mary and Susan.

Her
father John, a brilliant mathematician, was recruited from Cambridge 
University to break German military ciphers at Bletchley Park in January
1940.

After being 
trained on how to break the German Enigma machine cipher by Alan Turing,
the 21-year-old Sidney Sussex College student devised a method of 
codebreaking that became known as the Herivel Tip.

After the war he published a number of books on his work and moved to Belfast to become a lecturer at Queen's University.

He and his wife Elizabeth, who also worked at Bletchley, later retired to Oxford, where he became a fellow of All Souls College in 1978.

In the same year Josephine, then 22, was arrested for assault and obstructing police in London along with a number of young women who were part of the same revolutionary sect run by Balakrishnan, known as 'Comrade Bala'.

When her father died in 2011 obituaries only made mention of his two other daughters, who now live in London.

Attempts by her family to make contact failed, according to family friend Frances Presley.

She told The Times: 'They have tried to contact her for years. I know she was involved in some kind of cult group. My understanding is that she cut herself off. I know they have always tried their best.'

Ms Herivel was prosecuted in 1978 after police raided the group's south London bookshop and headquarters. She and five fellow cult members appeared in court charged with obstructing police officers.

She refused to recognise the court and denouncing the judge as a 'fascist lackey'.

Ms Herivel was also with the sect when one of its members, Sian Davies died in mysterious circumstances in 1997.

Ms Davies died in hospital, seven months after falling from a bathroom window at a house in south London where the collective were living.

Documentary footage of Balakrishnan and his wife has also been uncovered by ITV News. The pictures were shot in 1997 as part of a documentary about the death of Ms Davies.

It is thought Ms Herivel lived with 
the group for more than 30 years before contacting the Freedom Charity 
and reporting that she and two other women were being held against their
will.

The other women 
are believed to be Ms Davies' 30-year-old daughter Rosie and Malaysian 
student Aishah Wahab, 69, who disappeared while studying in Britain.

Today her sister Kamar Mautum flew into London to see her for the first time in at least 30 years.

She
said: 'I will do anything to bring her home. I want to see her before 
either of us dies. I am not sure if she will remember me but I am 
hopeful she will.'
