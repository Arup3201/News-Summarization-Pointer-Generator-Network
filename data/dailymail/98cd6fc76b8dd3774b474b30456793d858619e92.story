Son of Barnsley: James Hudson Taylor is the 19th Century missionary who took Christianity to China

It's a strange and bold ambition, but the people of Barnsley are hoping to become a Christian pilgrimage destination on a scale to rival Lourdes.

Tourism chiefs are launching a major push to attract an astonishing 70 million Chinese Christians who revere the South Yorkshire mining town as the birthplace of 19th century missionary James Hudson Taylor.

Hudson Taylor is the man who took Christianity to China and is responsible for the fact that there are more Christians there than there are people in Britain.

Barnsley already attracts a few Chinese Christian tourists who pay homage to Hudson Taylor - who is little known in the rest of Britain - but is
planning to go on the offensive to attract them in droves.

John
Foster, who runs Foster’s Bakery and is chairman of the Barnsley Work 
and Skills Board, said Chinese tourism could revive the local economy.

He said: 'More than 50 per cent of the 
overseas tourists visiting Britain are Chinese and they are already 
visiting places like York and Haworth.

Heritage: The South Yorkshire town is well-known for its mining history. The former leader of the miners' union Arthur Scargill was born here

'They’ve got spending power and are visiting in massive numbers.

'There
are more Christians in China and the Far East who owe their heritage to
James Hudson Taylor than there are people in Britain.

'And Barnsley has this unique claim to attract them.

'It could be a place of religious interest like Canterbury or Lourdes.'

Hudson was born in 1832 in Barnsley, and although the son of a Methodist minister. only became a Christian as a teenager.

After his conversion he developed a deep passion for China and decided at the tender age of 17 to make it his life's work to 'evangelise all China, to preach Christ to all its peoples by any and all means'.

In preparation he joined the Chinese Evangelization Society and began medical training, but sailed to Shanghai at the age of 21 before he finished his studies.

He insisted on dressing and living like the Chinese people, which made him an oddity at the time. He even shaved the front of his head and grew a pigtail like Chinese men.

After six years in China he returned to England because of ill health, now married to missionary teacher Maria Dyer, and decided to start a new mission society, the China Inland Mission.

All members would wear Chinese dress and work in interior villages and cities that previously did not have any missionary work.

The organisation's name was later changed to the Chinese 
Overseas Mission Fellowship.

In 1866, the first 16 CIM missionaries joined Hudson, Maria, and their two children on the boat to Shanghai. Many had joined CIM after hearing Hudson's dynamic speaking. In time the CIM grew to more than 1,300 missionaries.

Altogether Hudson spent of 50 years in China, losing his wife, three children and later dying there himself in 1905.

Hudson Taylor was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Zhenjiang which was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.

In 1988 his great-grandson, James Taylor III, discovered the tombstone in Zhenjiang Museum.

The remainder of the memorial - erected by the CIM - was discovered later, intact and was re-erected inside a nearby church in 1999.

There is also a plaque commemorating Taylor Hudson's work on a house in Pyrland Road, Highbury, London, which was used as a base for the mission in this country.

Hudson Taylor's descendants have continued his legacy in Asia.

His eldest son Herbert also served there for over 50 years – the last three as a prisoner of the Japanese at the Weifang internment camp during World War II along with Olympic gold-medallist and missionary Eric Liddell, who died there.

Herbert Hudson Taylor's grandson - James Hudson Taylor III - continued his ministry, in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He died in 2009.

His son James Hudson Taylor IV is currently operations director of OMF International Chinese ministries.

Born in Barnsley in 1832, Hudson Taylor made it his life's work to take Christianity to the Chinese, spending more than 50 years there and leaving a legacy which is carried on by his descendants to this day.

He founded the Chinese 
Overseas Mission Fellowship, which now has a 70 million-strong membership of
Christian churches in China and the Asian Pacific region.

Barnsley's James Hudson Taylor group wants to erect up to 12 plaques in his honour.

Last month a group of about 15 Chinese
Christians visited the town and went to the Salem Wesleyan Reform Church in Blucher Street, 
where there is a plaque to commemorate the missionary work of Hudson Taylor.

They also visited nearby Cheapside where Hudson Taylor was born and where the family ran a chemist, where Boots now stands.

Group member Michael Rossiter and Jenifer Dore helped show them around.

Mr Rossiter said: 'One kissed the ground outside Boots. They refer to Barnsley as their spiritual home.

'James
Hudson Taylor should be a famous son of Barnsley.

'He’s left a legacy 
that Barnsley would do well to look closely at and build on.

'As Christians we are concerned about the well-being of the town. One of the obvious ways to boost it is through tourism.'

Plaques are planned for Boots, a house at
Paddock Close, Staincross, where Hudson-Taylor's descendants lived, and another at 
the top of Old Mill Lane which they moved to.

There will also be a permanent exhibition at the new Experience Barnsley museum in the town hall.

Barnsley Council leader Steve Houghton said he was grateful for the work the group was doing.

He said: 'I hadn’t realised the importance of James Hudson Taylor in China.

'If people are interested in coming to see that heritage, then fantastic.'

A council spokesman said officers 
would work with any community groups interested in raising the profile 
of ‘this inspirational man’s work’.

She
said: 'Growth in the visitor economy of the borough is an important 
priority for the authority and clearly the story of James Hudson Taylor 
has the potential to attract more national and international visitors to
Barnsley.'

Gary Verity, Chief Executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said the plan was interesting.

'We are always interested to hear 
about unique and creative ways or attracting even more overseas visitors
to Barnsley and the rest of our great county,' he said.

'Latest stats show the value of international trips to Yorkshire went up by 22 per cent and visits rose by 16 per cent.

So ideas like this could help 
encourage even more visitors from China to come and experience this 
trail in Barnsley - and Yorkshire’s wider, unrivalled tourism offer - 
which would help boost the county’s tourism economy.'
