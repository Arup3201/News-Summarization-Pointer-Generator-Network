Irish bookmaker Paddy Power is known for its attention-grabbing publicity stunts.

In a particularly bold move, it has now paid out more than £400,000 on a Barack Obama win - before votes were counted.

Paddy Power decided the election was 'a done deal' and said 'the punters had called it' after noticing that more than 75 per cent of money coming in was going Obama's way.

The firm took out an advert in the Irish Times that read: 'Sorry Romney, you're not black or cool. We're paying out early on an Obama victory.'

President Obama last night swept to a comfortable win over Republican candidate Mitt Romney, easily surpassing the 270 electoral votes he needed.

He told a rally of cheering supporters in Washington that 'the best is yet to come' for the U.S.

His convincing win comes after he led the country through its biggest economic challenges since the Great Depression of the 1930s, as well as dealing with the fall-out of Superstorm Sandy over the past ten days.

Paddy Power announced that the Democrat's win was a 'nailed-on certainty' after odds fell to a low 2/9.

A Paddy Power spokesperson said: 'Romney gave it a good shot and is doing well in the popular vote, but we suspect he’s had his moment in the sun and is likely to be remembered more for his legendary gaffes than Presidential potential.  

'The overall betting trend has shown one-way traffic for Obama and punters seemed to have called it 100 per cent correct. Despite Romney appealing to the large evangelical and senior vote, America’s sticking with black and cool.'

The ad has attracted the attention of the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, after a complaint that it is prejudiced, and the ASAI is following it up with Paddy Power.

'Best to come': President Obama celebrated a comfortable win over Republican candidate Mitt Romney

Paddy Power has made its fascination with the 44th president of the United States clear before.

When Obama visited Ireland in May 2011, it renamed 13 of its shops 'Obama Power' and took bets on which pub the president would visit to drink a pint of Guinness.

In 2008, the bookies again went for shock-tactics by offering 12-1 odds the President would not finish his first term in office. It later confirmed it would pay out if Obama were killed by a sniper, according to the Irish Independent.

Two years ago, Paddy Power fell foul of the law after erecting gigantic Hollywood-style letters spelling out its name beside Celtic Manor Golf Course during the Ryder Cup.

In the same year, the company paid £10,000 to sponsor a confession box in a Catholic church, branding it with the Paddy Power logo and renaming it the 'sin bin.'
