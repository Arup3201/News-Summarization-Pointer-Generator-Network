Barcelona star Neymar is best known for plying his trade on the field at the Nou Camp - but he has tried his hand at American football ahead of the Superbowl on Sunday.

The Brazilian took on the challenge of trying to break the 64-yard field goal record in Catalonia - but came up short.

Neymar's first attempt from 50 yards sailed over the sticks, as did his second from 60 yards.

However, the three attempts the 22-year-old took from the 64-yard mark were all sent with too low a trajectory and failed to find the target.

Neymar himself also scored Barca's first equaliser in their come-from-behind 3-2 victory over Villarreal at the Nou Camp on Sunday.
