New government says it needs $35 billion aid in next two years

Chancellor: 'UK willing to pour in taxpayers’ money to help government'

George Osborne offered the Ukraine a blank cheque last night to turn the ravaged country around

Ukraine's new government today said it needs a massive $35 billion aid package over this year and next to keep its economy from collapse.

It asked for the cash because Russia will no longer support it after the ousting of president Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Moscow. 

The plea was issued within hours of George Osborne saying that British taxpayers' money would be available - and saying: 'We should be there with a chequebook to help the people of Ukraine rebuild their country."

But Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, cautioned against unconditional help, saying the new government had to strike a proper agreement with the International Monetary Fund and stick by it.

"As you know in Ukraine we have a long 
record of agreements that have not been honoured," Sikorski, one of the 
European Union's mediators in the Ukraine crisis, told a news 
conference.

"There is a huge amount of macroeconomic assistance 
available for Ukraine as soon as Ukraine concludes an agreement with the
 IMF."

The European Union today said it had started contact with the United States, Japan, China, Canada and Turkey on coordinating aid for Ukraine.

A senior official said that it could organise a donors' conference - a meeting of countries wealthy enough and willing to give cash - to raise short-term funding for Ukraine, which has said it needs $35 billion to survive 2014 and 2015.

"A donors' conference as the situation stabilises would be one way (to help Ukraine)," the official told Reuters.

"We have also had contacts with the Japanese, Chinese, Canadians, Turks and the US," he said.

People gather for prayers and to listen to speakers in Independence Square in Kiev, Ukraine. After a chaotic and violent week, Viktor Yanukovych has been ousted as President as the Ukrainian parliament moves forward with scheduling new elections and establishing a caretaker government

William Hague, the British Foreign Secretary, said he would travel to America to speak to John Kerry, the Secretary of State, and the IMF, which is based in Washington DC.

"Ukraine's financial situation is very serious and without outside assistance may not be sustainable. An economic crisis in Ukraine would be a grave threat to the country's stability and have damaging wider consequences," Mr Hague said.

Earlier, at a meeting of G20 finance
 ministers in Australia, Mr Osborne said: ‘We are here ready to help 
just as soon as there is someone at the end of the telephone.

'We should be there with a chequebook to help the people of Ukraine rebuild their country.’

It was unclear how much cash might be provided but Britain is 
likely to contribute to stability funds being put together by the 
European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

Since the uprising on Saturday ousted the Russian-backed President 
Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine no longer has access to a £9billion handout 
from Moscow.

There are also 
questions over whether agreements to provide it with natural gas could 
be in jeopardy, leading to the prospect of people being left without 
power and heating. 

Ukraine may need a bailout since it 
has a dire ‘CCC’ credit rating, but British taxpayers may not take 
kindly to assisting a country with huge natural resources including oil,
 whose former president spent millions on a vulgar palace while his 
people suffered.

IMF boss 
Christine Lagarde also suggested that Western taxpayers may help Ukraine
 get back on its feet. She said: ‘If it needs policy advice, financial 
support and wants to actually undertake a reform of its economy the IMF 
will help.’

One claim was that he was holed up in a bunker accompanied by loyal armed guards, another that he was ensconced in the home of a crony in the east of the country.

The disgraced and powerless president even failed in a bid to bribe Ukrainian border guards to allow his chartered aircraft to fly from Donetsk airport to an unknown destination in Russia.

‘The top public official made an attempt to fly abroad,’ said spokesman Serhii Astakhov. ‘This charter was not planned  in advance. 

‘When border guards arrived for the formalisation procedures they were met by an armed group of men, who offered them a bribe to allow departure without the proper paperwork for flying abroad. The border guards refused.’

Yanukovych then left the plane and got into a car, according to Ukraine’s new interior minister Arsen Avakov, who said the fugitive president ‘headed in an unknown direction’.

The country’s new authorities said 
yesterday that those suspected of ordering and carrying out ‘mass 
murder’ of opposition activists in Ukraine will face trial.

Former
 prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko was among those insisting that no-one 
should be spared, even her old adversary Yanukovych.

Paperwork found at the president’s abandoned mansion is expected to mean he would face a criminal probe for corruption.

It was far from clear last night whether Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to see his former ally enter Russia.

In Kiev, bickering started among the pro-Western politicians who came to power on a tidal wave of popular discontent – with many opposed to freed ex-premier Yulia Tymoshenko’s bid to become president.

And there were alarming signs of pressure for secession in the pro-Russian East, fuelled by nationalistic rhetoric from senior Moscow figures amid fears that the country could sink into civil war.

Independence Square in Kiev on Monday where people flock to see the site of protests which led to the end of president Viktor Yaukovych's government. The new administration now says it needs $35 billion between now and next year to keep its economy from collapse.

In Crimea, hundreds queued to join a ‘self-defence’ brigade in an area which has so far refused to accept parliament’s authority in Kiev.

In Kharkiv, the city to which Yanukovych had fled, some 3,000 ‘defenders’ barricaded themselves around a statue of Lenin vowing to resist the control of the new authorities.

And the Ukrainian flag was lowered from the mayor’s office in Kerch – and the Russian flag raised instead. Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky last night claimed eastern Ukraine should rejoin Russia, with Moscow ‘switching off the gas’ to the rest of the country.

The south and industrial east ‘can go under our jurisdiction’, he said, while the rest of Ukraine would ‘starve’.

‘There will be no work. We  have all rights to switch gas off tomorrow. They have not paid since September.

‘And we should not give any money. We should claim back $2billion, and that’s it.’

Yanukovych’s own party  yesterday disowned him in a statement saying: ‘We are experiencing one of the most difficult and tragic periods in our country’s history.

‘Ukraine has been deceived and robbed, but even this is nothing next to the grief that has afflicted dozens of Ukrainian families on both sides of the confrontation … Ukraine was betrayed … 

‘All responsibility for this lies with Yanukovych and his  close entourage.’
