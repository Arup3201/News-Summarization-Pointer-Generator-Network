American Airlines could be heading for bankruptcy protection as its parent company’s share price today plummeted 33 per cent to an eight-year low.

The only way American Airlines can now return to profitability is to use the bankruptcy court to cut its huge costs, some Wall Street analysts warned.

It comes amid a gloomy outlook for the airline industry worldwide and a concerning announcement last week that 129 American pilots had retired.

Stormy outlook: Some Wall Street analysts said the only way American Airlines can now return to profitability is to use the bankruptcy court to cut its costs

Shares of parent company AMR tumbled 33 per cent on Monday to close at $1.98 and the stock price is down more than 75 per cent this year.

AMR shares have not closed below the $2 mark since 2003. Stocks for the entire U.S. airline industry have fallen 40 per cent for the year.

‘For a long time, I've thought that the company has been at a disadvantage,’ Morningstar airline analyst Basili Alukos said.

He said American must go through bankruptcy to bring its labour or debt in line with the lower costs of competitors.

American is the only major airline that has lost money this year, losing a whopping $286million in the second quarter alone.

But Maxim Group airline specialist Ray Neidl countered: ‘It's been a tremendous overreaction today in my opinion.

‘American does have big problems to solve, but they have plenty of time to do it.’

The airline said bankruptcy is ‘certainly not our goal or our preference’.

‘We know we need to improve our results, and we have a sense of urgency as we work to achieve that,’ it added.

The airline is expected to end the third quarter with a healthy $4.3billion in cash reserves. As of late June, AMR had about $9.77 billion in liabilities.

But Mr Alukos said the airline still ‘may not be able to satisfy all of its future commitments on its current fiscal trajectory'.

‘We are placing AMR under review as we reassess the company's ability to remain solvent,' he added.

Some on Wall Street viewed high numbers of American pilot retirements as a sign that senior employees are fearful for the company's health.

At the start of the weekend 129 pilots 
put in their retirement papers. The prior month saw 111 pilots retire. 
During a typical month 10 pilots retire.

But David J. Bates, president of the pilots union for American said the retirements have nothing to do with the health of the airline.

‘A lot of it is pure economics,’ Mr Bates said.

A provision in the pilots' retirement benefits allows them to lock in the value of some of their investments going back 60 to 90 days.

Pilots who retire now can therefore avoid the summer stock market slump.

Mr Bates reiterated his confidence in the company's finances saying, ‘I don't see any immediate liquidity concerns.’

Stocks slumped in heavy volume to a 13-month low on Monday as investors dumped bank shares on fears that Greece's worsening financial crisis could cause a large European lender to fail.

Markets have feared European officials will be unable to prevent Greece's fiscal crisis from turning into a global banking crisis.

The Dow dropped 258 points, or 2.36 per cent, to 10,655; the S&P 500 fell 32 points, or 2.85 per cent, to 1,099; and the Nasdaq lost 80 points, or 3.29 per cent, to 2,336.

Not everybody sees the airline heading to bankruptcy court.

‘Management has indicated time and time again that they have no interest in filing,’ said Helane Becker, an analyst with Dahlman Rose.

While most major U.S. airlines filed for bankruptcy protection early last decade, American chose to avoid restructuring.

It also avoided a reorganisation when fuel prices spiked and travel declined in 2008 and 2009.

Meanwhile, experts warn that an economic downturn could hit travel demand just as airlines are beginning to recover.

The International Air Transport Association said airline traffic slowed in August on July, with the total passenger market down 1.6 per cent.
