The teenager was allegedly strangled by her two brothers and thrown in the Ganges river in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh - which lies 43km northeast of capital New Delhi.

Hastinapur police chief P K Singh said the victim was thought to be having an affair with a man from the same village. 

Her parents discovered she was eight months pregnant when they took her to a doctor after she felt unwell one day, The Times of India reported.

Mr Singh added her brother Sonu and cousin Bhoore and another accomplice took her to the canal where they strangled her and dumped her body.    

The girl's body was dumped in the Ganges river in Meerut, in the Uttar Pradesh district of India 

A post-mortem examination confirmed the girl had been strangled and police are searching for the three men, who have been charged with murder.

The suspects have absconded since the incident came to light and a manhunt is underway to find them, police added. 

Recently, activists have said the law into honour killings in India need review after the death of Bhavna Yadav, a 21-year-old student.

The third-year Delhi University student was murdered by her parents for marrying her friend, Abhishek Seth, against their wishes.

National Commission for Women member Shamina Shafiq said: 'There is no honour in these killings. These are horror killings. 

'A stringent law is the need of the hour. Besides a strong bill, it also needs enforcement and education.

'No laws punishing crimes in the name of honour exist in India.'
