As wedding proposals go, it did not appear at first to be the most romantic. Indeed it appeared more a kidnapping than the start of a wonderful life together.

A car is chased down a road by a posse of men on motorbikes until one biker pulls up in front of the vehicle forcing it to brake and then stop.

The driver gets out whereupon he is ‘attacked’ by the biker who pushes him onto the bonnet of the car.

Steady: The man is 'pushed' onto the bonnet of his car by a helmeted biker; his girlfriend reacts inside the car

As her boyfriend stands up to the thug, his girlfriend decides that she needs a word... with him

The woman remonstrates with one of the bikers while her boyfriend reaches into his back pocket for the ring

The female passenger gets out to discover what is going on and at first appears upset that her boyfriend is getting into a fight.

Then she is amazed when he gets down on one knee and asks her to make him the happiest man in the world as one of the bilkers opens the boot and produces a bunch of flowers.

Fortunately for him, she says yes and the thumping German punk soundtrack on the video changes to the decidedly more romantic She’s The One by Robbie Williams.

She is furious that he is putting himself in danger and is in no mood to calm down

Okay, what's going on here? She wonders as he goes down onto one knee

She cannot believe what is happening and assumes that the Russian version of Jeremy Beadle is about to pop out

Fortunately for all concerned she says yes and one of the bikers opens the boot where a bunch of flowers has been cunningly concealed

It's all good: She hugs him, he is relieved, the bikers clap and cheer, and the soon to be happy couple can begin preparing their day
