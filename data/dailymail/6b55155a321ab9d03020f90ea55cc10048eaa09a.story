Effective officer on patrol or laughing stock? Chief Supt Nick Adderley of Greater Manchester Police, pictured, is considering using Segways to patrol the city centre

Police force bosses considering patrolling the streets of Manchester on two-wheeled Segways have been warned it will turn their officers into a 'laughing stock'.

Greater Manchester Police bosses are considering buying two of the self-balancing electric vehicles, complete with GMP livery, sirens and blue flashing lights, to help them police the city centre.

The vehicles, which have a maximum speed of 12mph, cost around £5,000 each, but the force, which has tested two vehicles loaned from a company in Leeds at the GMP headquarters, is said to be considering a sponsorship deal.

Divisional commander Chief Supt Nick Adderley tweeted a picture of himself 
riding one of the Segways and said: 'To increase visibility and 
accessibility to officers in the city of Manchester, I want to introduce
 Segways. Good idea?'

He said 'We are looking at the feasibility of how successful they would be. We might rent first and give them a try.

'I
 think it is something we can do to increase visibility and 
approachability. We are increasing our suite of bicycles anyway but some
 areas are not suitable for bikes - like Market Street or the Arndale 
Centre

'A
 police officer can cover a greater distance quicker, and officers would 
be on a raised platform to improve visibility.

'They are pretty easy to 
use once you get used to them and they proved very popular with other 
officers when we tested them.'

However Twitter users were quick to pour scorn on the idea, with one suggesting bicycles might be 'healthier and more accessible' and another saying: 'Couldn't they just walk?'

One Manchester city centre shopkeeper was more forthright, however, calling the plan 'a daft idea'.

The man, who asked not to be named, said: 'It will turn the police into a laughing stock. Can you imagine them chasing down the criminals in Manchester on one of those?'

He added: 'They will look like that guy in the Hollywood film Paul Blart Mall Cop - the only way they will catch someone is because the offender will fall about laughing.

'Sorry, it might work in America, but it won't work here.'

GMP said the plan was under consideration while they considered the practical and legal implications, and no decision had yet been taken.

Segways were trialled by police in the south London borough of Sutton in 2007, but Met officials decided not to use them after the trial showed they were rarely used and were also illegal to use on the road.

First unveiled in New York in 2001, Segways were invented by Dean Kamen after he designed an all-terrain electric wheelchair called an iBot.

Segways operate purely by balance, and riders stand upright and control the vehicle through tall handlebars.

Immortalised
 in the 2009 hit movie Paul Blart: Mall Cop, they are used across the world at theme parks, tourist attractions, shopping centres and by security
 guards on housing estates.

Invented in 2001, Segways work using the rider's balance to control speed and direction

In Britain, Segways are illegal to use on pavements 
and do not meet regulations designed for electric bikes, so they cannot 
be used on roads as motor vehicles either.

However adventure companies in the UK advertise Segway 'experience' days for thrill-seekers, usually in forest settings.

In 2010 Jimi Heselden, the British multi-millionaire who owned Segway Inc, which makes Segways, died in a freak accident while riding one of his vehicles.

Mr Heselden, who was 62, apparently lost control of his Segway while riding it on his estate near Boston Spa, West Yorkshire.  He and his all-terrain Segway were found in the River Wharfe which ran 80ft below a cliff on his estate, leading police to suspect he had been riding the vehicle when he fell off the cliff and into the river below.

Illegal on pavements and not classed as electric bikes, they're only legal on private roads in Britain
