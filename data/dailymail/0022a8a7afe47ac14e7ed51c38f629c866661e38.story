A woman made a desperate 999 call saying she was ‘running for her life’ moments before she was shot dead by her mother’s ex-boyfriend, a court heard yesterday.

Lucy Lee, 40, told the emergency operator ‘I fear he’s going to shoot me’ after John Lowe, 82, allegedly shot her mother Christine.

Armed police later surrounded Lowe’s farm but found the mother and daughter both dead amid ‘a scene of carnage’, the court heard.

Killed: Lucy Lee, 40, made a desperate 999 call saying she was ‘running for her life’ moments before she was shot by 

Lowe, a dog breeder, was said to have shown no remorse for killing them. After his arrest he is alleged to have told police: ‘I shot them both.’ He also said: ‘They’ve been giving me s*** for weeks.’

The pensioner denies two charges of murder and a third charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.

Guildford Crown Court heard that he shot his 66-year-old former partner and her daughter at close range before killing four dogs at his farm in Tilford near Farnham, Surrey.

Prosecutor Mark Dennis QC told the jury about a ‘desperate [999] call’ made by Lucy at 9.44am on February 23 this year.

The court was played the harrowing 999 call from Lucy Lee as she 'ran for her life.'

Breathing heavily and shouting, Lucy told the emergency operator: 'My mother has been shot. I'm running for my life.'

Lucy repeatedly told the operator the address of the property, adding: 'He shot my mum. John Lowe.'

She then said: 'I'm gonna go back for him but I'll die. Get Rafferty [a local policeman].

'I'm nearly outside the house and I fear he's going to shoot me.

'I don't know if I'm going to be alive if I go back in there. He shot my mum. Bye.'

The call was then ended.

‘The female caller was in a frightened and frantic state, saying that a man called John Lowe had just shot her mother and that she was herself running for her life,’ he said.

‘Moments later, showing extraordinary courage, the caller indicated that she had made the decision to go back to the scene of the incident, saying as she ran, “I’m gonna go back for him but I’ll die,” followed by, “I’m nearly outside the house and I fear he’s going to shoot me.”

‘Her last words to the operator were, “I don’t know if I’m going to be alive if I go back in there. He shot my mum. Bye.” Those were indeed her last words to anyone save possibly to John Lowe, who moments later was to kill her with two shots from a shotgun.’

The jury heard that when police arrived they found Lucy lifeless on the garden steps and Christine dead in the living room.

Lowe, who had a valid shotgun licence at the time, had used the same weapon to kill the pair and the four dogs. A post-mortem examination confirmed Christine was killed by a single gunshot fired into her chest from about 1ft away. Mr Dennis said evidence suggested that he shot Christine as she was in a ‘cowering position’ as he stood over her. Lucy was shot in the back of her head from around 9ft away. Lowe then had to reload before firing a second fatal shot into her chest.

‘The defendant, in effect, ended her life in the same heartless way as he used to dispose of the lives of the four dogs,’ he said.

The court heard that the former gamekeeper had a love-hate relationship with the pair, who had been looking after him in the months before their deaths.

Mr Dennis said that Christine had known Lowe for many years and had occasionally been in a relationship with him.

She had moved into his house to care for him after he fell on hard times. Lowe’s long-term partner Susanna Wilson had died in 2013 and he had lost his licence to breed dogs at the farm.

But Mr Dennis said that the defendant had complained about the mother and daughter interfering in his affairs.

A few weeks before the killings, Lowe told a mechanic who visited the property to repair a vehicle: ‘Those two between them drive me ******* mad, they want to know about the ins and out of everything.’

PC Chris Gleeson, who arrested Lowe, said: ‘He said she [Christine] was an ex-girlfriend and added, “She’s been supposed to be looking after me but she’s been starving me to death and she’s been keeping me short of money. I just sold my Toyota Landcruiser for £5,500 and they’ve spent the lot.”’

The trial continues.
