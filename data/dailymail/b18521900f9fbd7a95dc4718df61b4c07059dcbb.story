A man who hit international headlines last year after being arrested for hacking an Australian government website has defended his conviction. 

Matthew Flannery, is currently serving a home detention of 15 months after he was convicted of five hacking charges after an obscene photo was uploaded to the Narrabri Shire Council website. 

At the time of his arrest in April last year Flannery was described as the leader of Lulzsec by the Australian Federal Police.

Matthew Flannery, 25, was described in an AFP press release as leader of hacking group LulzSec

Flannery claims he sent the message as a joke to a friend, he is serving 15 months' home detention

In a new interview with ABC programme 7.30 Flannery, from Point Clare on the NSW Central Coast, claims that the 'AFP's claims are based on a single joke Facebook message'. 

Lulzsec, abbreviated from Lulz Security, is an international hacking group which has claimed responsibility for several high profile hackings including taking down the CIA website.  

Flannery told the show: 'I went to a computer in the library because, you know, they'd taken mine, and I started Googling [sic] and to my shock and horror I found that not only was I being reported by Australian news agencies, but also internationally,' reports ABC. 

The programme's investigation looked into the court documents and say they found just one reference to LulzSec. 

Flannery says that one reference was a joke in a Facebook message to one of his friends.

He added: 'I would like to know if that is solely what they are basing their claims off of and, if so, then why did the AFP - in a press release in front of the world - state that I had made claims in online chat communities that were frequented by LulzSec members that I was the leader of LulzSec?' 

The 7.30 investigation says it found a teenage accomplice of Flannery actually carried out the hacking, this person was raided by police but never charged.

Commander Glen McEwen, the AFP's national manager of cyber crime, also appeared on the show and said he couldn't be 100 per cent sure Flannery was not a member of LulzSec. 

Commander Glen McEwen, the AFP's national manager of cyber crime, said the police would not apologise for arresting Flannery 

Commander McEwen said: 'As you'd appreciate, the virtual world and the anonymity as such, people come together for certain reasons and move away.

'I cannot categorically say that the individual was part of LulzSec but I definitely can't discount that.

'I don't make any excuse or apologise for the activity of the AFP in relation to this matter.'
