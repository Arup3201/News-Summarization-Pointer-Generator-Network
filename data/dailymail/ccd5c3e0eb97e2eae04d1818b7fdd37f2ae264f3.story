No one can accuse them of melting into the crowd.

With their lurid pink and purple uniforms, the army of Olympic volunteers will be easy to spot.

In fact the new outfits are so bright, Mayor of London Boris Johnson apologised for them yesterday.

Britain's next top model? Boris Johnson gathered 30 Team London Ambassadors together to showcase the new uniform

Greeting some of the 8,000 'London 
Ambassadors', who will guide tourists around the capital, he said: 'What
 do you think of the uniform?

'It's quite striking, isn't it? I 
hope you don't feel too ridiculous. We need to overcome our natural 
British reserve and be a little bit more like the Australians!'

Some observers even described the outfits as looking more like Percy Pig sweets from Marks & Spencer.

They consist of a polo shirt with matching fleece, anorak and rucksack as well as a straw trilby with a pink ribbon.

They are based on the Olympic 2012 logo, which MPs described as 'childish' when it was unveiled five years ago.

The ensembles are based on on the 
Olympic logo, which cost £400,000 to design but was lambasted by MPs as 
'childish' when it was unveiled in 2007.

Hats off! The uniform - a loose tracksuit top and matching poloshirt - comes with a beige trilby trimmed with a pink ribbon

Hogging the limelight: The inspiration could have been a Marks & Spencer Percy Pig sweet

Magenta, one of the official Olympic 
colours, has been chosen as the 'way-finding' colour and will also 
feature on signposts for the games.

Greeting the volunteers at Wimbledon 
Station in South London, Mr Johnson added: 'I think the uniforms are beautiful. I have a rucksack in the same livery but it's not the same style.

'Whoever designed it needs a prize. It's very striking. It's positive. It's optimistic.'

Asked whether he'd be wearing his 
uniform to the games, he added: 'I wouldn't rule it out. I have a fleece
 already but this could be a good replacement.

'It's in extremely good taste and style, and typical of London.'

The uniforms were received with brave
 faces from the Olympic ambassadors, who will be working as volunteers 
during the games to help visitors navigate London.

The volunteers will be stationed at 
key points in the city such as airports and tourist attractions to give 
directions and advice.

Andy Von Hirshberg, 29, a brand 
manager from London, said: 'The uniforms are interesting. I was a little
 surprised at first saw them, but at least we'll stand out. I can live 
with wearing pink and purple for a week.'

Highly
 visible: 8,000 people have volunteered to be London Ambassadors, to be 
stationed at pods across the capital to welcome visitors and direct them
 around the city - and the Olympics committee wanted them to be easy to 
spot

Danielle Holdsworth, 41, a marketing 
manager from London, added: 'This is the first time we've seen the 
uniforms, and they're certainly bright. They are quite out there, but we
 as ambassadors need to be out there so it's totally the right thing to 
wear.'

London Ambassador Barbara Edwards, 
65, said: ‘I like the trilby hat as it suits both men and women and will
 be useful to have as we will be outside a lot of the time in the sun. 
The black bottoms are also practical and sensible. I don’t mind the 
purple and the pink as you need to be visible and stand out and they’ve 
obviously taken some of the logo colours.

'But
 while the shirt is fine on the men, it gives a 'big pink bra' effect on
 the women, which isn’t particularly flattering and will be more 
noticeable on ladies with a larger bust.'

It's that way! Boris tries out one of the Ambassadors' information pods for size

The ambassadors were selected from 
more than 30,000 applicants and are aged between 14 and 85, speaking 40 
languages between them.

Organisers said they were looking for people with good communication skills as well as knowledge of the city.

They will volunteer for a maximum of five hours per shift and up to six consecutive days.

Controversial: The London 2012 logo drew criticism for being gaudy and puerile

Also unveiled yesterday was the 
design for the Olympic information kiosks – also in shocking pink - 
which will be stationed at 43 locations in the city.

Both have been designed by M 
Integrated Solutions, based on guidelines set out by the the London 
Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG).

The mixed response echoes the public reaction to the controversial London 2012 logo after it was unveiled in 2007.

At the time, the London Olympic committee came under fire for approving the over-the-top design, which drew fierce criticism for being garish and 'childish.'

Contemporary British designers were 
near-unanimous in their disapproval of the logo, describing it as 
'confusing' and 'embarrassing'.

Stephen Bayley, founder of the Design Museum, said it was 'a puerile mess, an artistic flop and a commercial scandal.'

A two week public exhibition has opened at City Hall to give a taste of how London will look and feel during Games time.

The exhibition will feature examples 
of the colourful dressing and bunting that will be on display throughout
 the city, plus a number of examples of how high streets and towns will 
be getting involved with the celebrations.
