This video shows the horrifying moment a Chinese girl is hit by a firecracker explosion, sending her tumbling down a sewer to her death.

The girl and two boys can be seen walking down the street before one of the children - believed to her brother - drops the small explosive down a manhole.

As they step back, a huge blast sends the manhole cover flying into the young girl, Zhaotong Yiliang Chia, as the explosion knocks her back and down a second drain. 

Horrifying: A Chinese girl died after a firecracker explosion sent her tumbling down into a sewer

The distressing video shows Zhaotong being hurled backwards before falling down the drain behind her, which was uncovered by the firecracker explosion.

Shockingly the two boys then appear to walk away, possibly unaware that she has fallen into the sewer in the south western Chinese province of Yunnan.

Two other men in the background also run away after the explosion but may not have seen the girl fall down the manhole.

Firefighters were called to the scene as dozens gathered around the drain, including Zhaotong's father, following the tragic accident last month.

The girl was fatally injured and died in hospital shortly after she was hauled from the manhole by firefighters

The girl's father was among the crowds as she was pulled from the sewer and rushed to hospital

He can be seen watching as she is eventually hauled from the drain and placed on the ground.

He rushes round to hold his daughter's hand but it is clear that she has been fatally injured. 

She was rushed to hospital but later died.
