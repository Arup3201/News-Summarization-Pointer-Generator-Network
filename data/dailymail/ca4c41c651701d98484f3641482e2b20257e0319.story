Jailed: Nicholas Cheese has been sentenced to 17 years in prison after assaulting a 13-year-old girl

A 27-year-old from the UK was jailed for 17 years on Monday after filming himself sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl from Maine who he befriended in a Harry Potter chat room.

Nicholas Cheese was found guilty of abusing the Levant girl over three days in a motel room in Bangor, Maine, in June last year.

As the judge jailed Cheese, from Wolvercote near Oxford, he condemned the businessman for subjecting the young girl to 'a range of sexual experiences many adults would refuse to explore'.

Cheese, who worked in the dry cleaning industry, had befriended the victim, who has not been identified, through an online chat room for fans of the Harry Potter children's books when she was 12.

He arranged to meet the girl at his motel room, when he traveled to the U.S. for a business trip, and admitted to police he knew she was only 13.

Cheese was found guilty of one count of producing pornography after filming his final encounter with the child.

Initial charges from his arrest on July 1, of gross sexual assault and sexual exploitation of a minor, were dismissed in September when his case moved from state to federal court.

The victim did not appear in court, but her father spoke on her behalf, telling Judge John Woodcock that his daughter had met Cheese when she was recovering from a life-threatening illness.

Cheese is said to have helped the girl through the illness, details of which were not revealed, then arranged to meet her while on his way to a conference in Texas.

'My daughter is more upset about what 
happened afterward,' he said of Cheese’s prosecution. 'She feels like she lost her best friend.'

The judge said that although the sex would be considered consensual if it had been between adults, he said the victim was not a '13-year-old who looked like she was 18', the Bangor Daily News reported.

He added: 'The defendant’s actions against this 13-year-old girl were unusually aggressive.'

As he sentenced Cheese to 17 years in prison and five years of supervised release, he said: 'When [Cheese] met her, he gave her a crash 
course in sex.

'In a matter of three days, he exposed her to a range of 
sexual experiences many adults would refuse to explore.'

Cheese wept as his parents, who had 
flown to the U.S. for his hearing, addressed the court and pleaded for 
leniency for their son. His father lives in Britain and his mother has a
 home in Spain.

The victim's father had contacted police on June 30 last year to say that his daughter had been sexually assaulted by a man from the UK.

Detective Andrew Whitehouse and Detective Brent Beaulieu interviewed Cheese at the motel he was staying in, and later arrested him and confiscated his passport.

During questioning Cheese admitted he had gone to Bangor to have sex with the 13-year-old, and that he had previously got her to send explicit pictures and videos to him.

The images and footage, and a sexually explicit photo taken in the motel room, were found on Cheese's cellphone, according to court documents.

Child pornography was also found on his home computer by police in the UK. It is not clear if he will face charges relating to those images.

He is expected to be deported at the end of his prison term in the U.S.
