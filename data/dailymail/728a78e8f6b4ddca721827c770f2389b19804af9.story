Their preparations for the World Cup have been meticulously planned by a dedicated team of sports scientists, physiotherapists and nutritionists.

It is therefore something of a surprise that England's footballers were allowed to enjoy a feast of burgers the night after they returned to Rio after losing their opening game.

BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan revealed that Roy Hodgson's men dined at a restaurant famous for serving some of Rio de Janeiro's best fast food, including a mammoth 10oz 'Mega Burger'.

In the process they denied her the chance to sample the Argentine beef patties for herself because they had booked out the whole place.

The FA said the England players' nutritionists gave them special permission to have the treat at the Aquarela Burger bar in the five-star Royal Tulip hotel, where they are staying in Rio.

Perhaps of more concern is that a month ago a Brazilian consumer group said it had found food well past its expiry date in the hotel.

Restaurant reviews reveal that the burger restaurant has in the past been a favourite with players from Brazilian teams Vasco da Gama and Flamengo, and stays open until 1am every day.

Hodgson has a more relaxed attitude to his team's diet, having already reinstated the use of tomato ketchup and brown sauce after they were banned by former England manager Fabio Capello.

Logan, 41, who is also staying in the Royal Tulip, wrote on her blog of how the 'Three Lions' scuppered her dinner plans on Monday night.

She said: 'With filming wrapped I suggested to my producer we should try the hotel burger bar, they looked amazing when I saw ITV eating them last week and we haven't succumbed yet.

'You know when you have built up a food in your head all day and you want it so much you can taste it, it is the human equivalent to our Boxer Dog watching a Sunday Roast being carved.'

But sadly for the salivating presenter, her hopes of tucking into one of the Royal Tulip's celebrated burgers were dashed.

She wrote: 'As we approached the burger bar, I saw a sign saying 'Private Event – Closed”. My heart sank, my stomach flipped. Then I peered in to see who was eating my burger, it was Team England.

'So as Wayne, Steve G and the rest devoured the best Argentinian beef, I had a bowl of chicken soup in the restaurant next door, not that I begrudge them at all. There's always tomorrow….'

A source close to the England team told the Daily Mail: 'Poor Gabby really missed a trick – yes, we were enjoying our burgers but she could have ordered one from the adjoining hotel restaurant. She should have read the menu.'

An FA spokesman added: 'The team were given a special treat which was cleared by the nutritionists.

'They have been together for more than a month now and they have burnt off thousands of calories so having a burger was not deemed to be harmful in any way.'

Several of England's rivals have also been allowed a few comfort foods between their matches in Brazil.   

Prior to the tournament it was revealed that the Italian FA's chef had packed parmesan, lots of olive oil and prosciutto ham.

Team USA brought oatmeal, Cheerios, peanut butter and A1 Steak Sauce to the World Cup party, while the Mexican squad naturally required a little more spice and travelled with chilli peppers, chipotle chillies and cacti.

Meanwhile, England's star striker Daniel Sturridge posted a candid selfie on Twitter to vent his frustration when his hotel room TV stopped working.

The 24-year-old Liverpool forward was unwinding after training on Monday night by watching an American basketball game.

But when the TV set started playing up, he uploaded an angry photograph of himself lying on his bed wearing his white England t-shirt and a second picture of the blank screen.

Sturridge, who scored England's only goal in the opening match against Italy, wrote: 'Just when I start getting into the game and it's going off my TV starts acting up... I'm fuming right now!!!'

Brazil 2014 is the first true 'selfie World Cup', with many players using Twitter and other social networks to share their personal experiences of the tournament.

More than 10,000 people have retweeted or favourited a picture posted by Sturridge of the England team travelling on their coach the day before the Italy game.

It is not just the footballers who have succumbed to the current fad for sharing photographs of oneself online.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani took a break from dealing with the jihadist onslaught in neighbouring Iraq to watch his country's 0-0 draw against Nigeria on Monday night.

To illustrate his support for Iran's players, he tweeted an incongruous picture of himself relaxing in front of his TV, having swapped his normal black clerical robe and white turban for an Iranian football shirt and tracksuit trousers.

In language far removed from the bombastic anti-Western rhetoric of some of his predecessors, Mr Rouhani wrote: 'Proud of our boys who secured our first point - hopefully the first of many more to come.'

German chancellor Angela Merkel grinned in a selfie with Germany and Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski while celebrating her country's 4-0 victory over Portugal on Monday. She was earlier pictured with the team in their changing room before many of them had got fully clothed again.
