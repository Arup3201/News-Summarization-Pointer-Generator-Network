Joy Corrigan, 20, is suing Apple after she claims naked photos were stolen from her iCloud account months before the recent celebgate hack where resulted in nude photos of stars flooding the internet

But just days later her account was hacked again and when she again contacted Apple, she was told the same thing.

After naked photos of over 100 actresses, performers and even Olympic athletes were released by a user on anonymous web forum 4Chan on August 31, Apple contacted her and denied any responsibility.

Corrigan is now launching a class-action lawsuit against the tech giant because of its ‘crappy security’ and she’s seeking other victims to join her in the lawsuit, reportsTMZ.

The victims included the Oscar-winning young actress Jennifer Lawrence, ex-Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay, Spiderman heroine Kirsten Dunst, busty supermodel Kate Upton and reality TV phenomenon Kim Kardashian.

A list of celebrity names published anonymously online mentioned scores more targets including actresses Kate Bosworth and Selena Gomez, singer Rihanna, British models Cara Delevingne and Kelly Brook, and TV presenter Cat Deeley.

One video - reportedly showed Brown Findlay, who played Downton’s Lady Sybil, was watched more than a million times online within hours of being posted.

The alleged hackers claimed to have stolen the photos and videos from Apple's iCloud - the global system that stores photos and videos recorded on iPhones and other Apple devices.

Apple strenuously denies any responsibility for the leaked images. 

After celebgate, the company issued a statement in which it insisted the leak was not due to a flaw in its iCloud or Find My iPhone systems but the result of the actions of hackers.

'After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords, and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the internet,' the statement read.

'None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone.'

The statement added that the company was 'continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.'

The FBI is now investigating the hacking.
