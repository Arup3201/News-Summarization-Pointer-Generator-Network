She comes from American royalty as her multi-millionaire grandfather Kemmons Wilson Sr. founded the Holiday Inn chain of hotels.

So it should come as no surprise that Lizzy Wilson, who tomorrow will wed Guy Pelly - the best friend of Princes William and Harry who are expected to be ushers - was once bestowed with the title of Queen Elizabeth.

While that title did not quite endow her Buckingham Palace - Lizzy, now 31, was in fact, the much heralded Queen of Carnival Memphis in 2003.

And a glimpse at the young, beaming Lizzy - who last night enjoyed her rehearsal dinner in Memphis with not just Wills and Harry but also their cousins Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie on hand - shows her wearing a glittering tiara and equally sparkly dress.

Rowdy: Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson let her hair down at her bachelorette party in Memphis. She wore her heart on her, well, chest!

Carnival Memphis is an annual event and Lizzy, the daughter of Kemmons Wilson Jr, and Norma Wilson, followed in the footsteps of her father who was Kind of Carnival in 1985. Not only that, her two sisters were both queens - Carey was Queen of Carnival in 1994 and Katherine was Queen of Carnival in 1999.

And before her reign, Lizzy was Carnival Princess in 2001, while her brothers Kem and McLean nad participated as royal pages, escorts and scarabs.

The family business, The Kemmons Wilson Companies, was launched by her 
grandfather, Kemmons Wilson, Sr., founder of Holiday Inn. Her father, 
known as Kern, continues to serve as a principal of the company.

Lizzy went to the University of Virginia where she made the Dean's List and was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma Sorority.

She said: 'It is 
truly an honor to represent Carnival this year as its Queen. My two 
older sisters have been terrific role models for me. I am most excited 
to be a part of the wonderful support Carnival provides to these worthy 
Children's charities. I consider it a blessing to give back to give back to my community in this small way. Join us this year as we celebrate Carnival 2003.'

Lizzy is now living in London, however her hometown is gearing up for its own version of the Royal Wedding tomorrow.

She will marry nightclub owner Guy Pelly, 32, at an outdoor ceremony at the exclusive Memphis Hunt and Polo Club.

Following a rather rowdy-looking bachelorette party, Lizzy and Guy enjoyed a rehearsal dinner with their royal chums last night.

Indeed, Lizzy was seen looking extremely close to Princess Beatrice as they left the popular BBQ restaurant Rendezvous on Thursday evening.

Princes William and Harry are both expected to be ushers at the wedding. The Duchess of Cambridge has remained in the UK with baby son Prince George.

The three-day celebrations will continue tonight with a visit to the former home of Elvis Presley, Graceland.

The royals, who are expected to stay for two days, will have the chance to have a tour of Graceland, wandering the Jungle Room, with its green shaggy carpets, the Trophy Building which houses all The King’s awards, as well as the luxury living room – all decorated with furnishings from the time Elvis lived in the property.

William, Harry and the Pelly wedding party are also expected to head to Beale Street in downtown Memphis to dine and have drinks.

Guy Pelly has remained a close friend of both William and Harry despite being caught up in a drug furor surrounding Harry in January 2002.

He was forced to deny introducing the then 17-year-old Harry to cannabis, insisting he had never dealt in drugs or taken them with the prince.

According to reports, Prince Harry was introduced to the drug during a private party in Tetbury, Gloucester, by Pelly, then an agricultural student at college in Cirencester.

However, Pelly - who quit his college course as a result of the media meltdown - said: 'I have never dealt in drugs at Highgrove, at the Rattlebone Inn or anywhere else.

'I have never taken drugs with Prince Harry or supplied any drugs to him.

'I have never used drugs at Highgrove or the Rattlebone Inn. I would like this categoric statement to put an end to the matter.'

Since then, he has set up a string of fashionable nightclubs in London, including Mahiki.
