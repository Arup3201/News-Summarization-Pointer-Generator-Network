A Scottish island, thought to have inspired the cult horror film The Wicker Man, is on the market for £2.5million.

Described as a ‘flourishing tourist enterprise and superb family residence’, Tanera Mor is the only inhabited island in the Summer Isles off Scotland’s west coast.

Lizzie and Richard Williams took over its 800 unspoilt acres from Mrs Williams' family in 2010 and are allowed to issue stamps from their own post office.

With six apartments to let it is also ideal for the holidaymaker who really wants to get away from it all. Just don’t bring your car – there are no roads.

Mrs Williams said: ‘After many years of calling Tanera home it is time for someone else to have the privilege of looking after this amazing place.

'We greatly appreciate the effort made by 
the local community to consider the opportunity of taking on 
Tanera and we fully understand their reasons for deciding not to.

'We 
hope that whoever owns the island in the future will enjoy the same warm
and co-operative relationship with the community that we have for the 
past 17 years.'

Film critics say the pagan cult isle of Summerisle, featured in the 1973 movie starring Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee, is set in the archipelago.

Residents on the nearby mainland at Achiltibuie in Wester Ross had been in talks with the island’s owners about a community buyout that could have seen a number of people move on to the isle.

But a public meeting in February decided that the buyout was just too much for them to take on.

In 1881 there were nearly 200 people living on the island but now there are just two, Lizzie and Richard Williams

Local interest group Coigach Community Development Company had been given the first opportunity to buy the island on behalf of residents.

In 1881, there were no fewer than 118 people living on Tanera Mor, all of whom had left by 1931.

Mrs Williams' family the Wilders bought the island in 1996 after selling their dairy farm in Wiltshire.

Bill and Jean Wilder passed the title of Tanera Mor on to their three offspring - Jack, Harry and Lizzie - in 2010.

Now that all three siblings have their own young families they took the decision to put it on the open market.

The 1973 film The Wicker Man starred Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland

The principal house - The Old School House - boasts breathtaking views over the magnificent mountains of the mainland.

Over the past 15 years the Wilder family have undertaken a woodland regeneration project, planting over 164,000 native trees.

This combined with the use of selective livestock grazing has encouraged wildlife to thrive.

The established holiday letting business, comprising six properties - with the potential to add a further two properties - has been expanded in recent years to include residential courses and a Royal Yachting Association-recognised sailing school in the summer.

The cafe and Post Office operate from a former boathouse and are open for seasonal daily visits by boat. 

John Bound, of selling agents CKD Galbraith, said: 'The chance to own your own Scottish island is extremely rare and with Tanera Mor’s thriving tourist enterprise coupled with being a truly spectacular place to live, we expect to receive a lot of interest as it goes on the open market.

'With on-going support and commitment from the local Coigach community, Tanera Mrr offers a truly fantastic prospect for interested parties who will very much have the island’s heritage and sustainability at heart as well as a fantastic life style.'
