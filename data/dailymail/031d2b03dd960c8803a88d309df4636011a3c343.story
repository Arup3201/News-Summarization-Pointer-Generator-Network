House prices soared by 10.4 per cent in the past year, official figures revealed this morning.

The continuing boom was fuelled by runaway prices in London, with homes in the capital £70,000 more expensive last month than at the same time last year – a 17.2 per cent increase in just 12 months.

Excluding the capital and the wider South East, house prices increased by 6.7 per cent across the rest of the country, the Office for National Statistics said.

Prices grew 10.8 per cent in England, 5.7 per cent in Wales, 4.9 per cent in Scotland and 4.9 per cent in Northern Ireland.

In England, prices grew fastest in the South East and East Anglia – up 11.9 per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively.

The booming property market is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get on their foot on the housing ladder.

In October, prices paid by first-time buyers were 12 per cent higher on average than at the same time the year before. For existing owners prices increased by 9.7 per cent.

By last month, first time buyers had to pay £208,000 to get on the ladder – while the average price paid by owner-occupiers was £312,000.

The average UK house price in October was £271,000 – with properties in England the most expensive at £283,000.

Homes in Wales cost £172,000 on average, £194,000 in Scotland and £137,000 in Northern Ireland.

In London meanwhile the average house costs £504,000 – almost three and a half times more than in the North East which has the lowest average house prices at £152,000.

London, the South East and the East all had prices higher than the UK average price of £271,000.

Excluding London and the South East, the average UK house price was £206,000.
