Shut it down: The incident, which occurred at the Kappa Sigma house (above), has now resulted in West Virginia University suspending all Greek life activities

Tweet: Burch tweeted his excitement for the night (above) just hours before he was found

Just a few hours before he was found not breathing on Wednesday, Burch wrote on Twitter, 'It's about to be a very eventful night to say the least.'  

'Words cannot describe the heartache we, as a West Virginia University family, feel at the loss of one of our own – Nolan Michael Burch – who passed away today,' said the university's President E. Gordon Gee in a statement.

'The outpouring of love and support from his friends and this community has been what you would expect from Mountaineers, and I would ask that you continue to keep the Burch family and many friends in your thoughts and prayers.'

Now, West Virginia University has suspended all fraternity and sorority events as of Thursday.after what they are calling a 'catastrophic medical emergency.' 

The incident also happened just one week after 19 intoxicated pledges from the Sigma Chi fraternity were arrested after participating in a street brawl.

Those students initially told authorities they were part of a rival fraternity, and now might be facing obstruction of justice charges in addition to underage possession of alcohol and assault. 

Unknown: Officials are still not sure what caused Burch's death, seen above in the middle with friends

Shock: A member of Burch's family said she was 'shocked' at what happened, speculating that it may have been the result of a fraternity hazing 

As for Burch, his family cannot believe what has happened.

'These things shouldn't happen,' his aunt, Joyce Stamp, told NBC News.

'He's only 18. He's a nice young man and I'm shocked.'

She then added, 'But he's a freshman and even very intelligent kids sometimes get caught up. You hear all the stuff about hazing, and this is first time away from home.' 

Brawl: 19 members of another fraternity, Sigma Chi (members seen above from last year) were arrested following a street fight last week

'The action to halt fraternity and sorority activities while these matters are being reviewed is being done with the well-being and safety of our students in mind,' said Corey Farris, West Virginia University's dean of students. 

'That is — and must always be — our foremost priority'

West Virginia is the second school to suspend Greek activities in just this week, with Johns Hopkins doing the same following claims a 16-year-old girl was raped in a bathroom during a party at a fraternity house.
