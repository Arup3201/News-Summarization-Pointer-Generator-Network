'Narcissist': Notorious serial killer Dennis Nilsen is serving life for six gruesome murders

One of Britain’s most notorious serial killers has had his self-serving and ‘pornographic’ autobiography published while he is in prison – in defiance of a government ban.

Dennis Nilsen, a former civil servant and police officer, is serving life for murdering six young men and attempting to kill two others in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Nilsen, who has been told he will never be released from jail - has spent more than a decade fighting for the right to publish his memoirs.

But the authorities, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett and the European Court of Human Rights, have repeatedly banned publication, claiming the lurid details of the killings would be distressing to the victims’ families.

But now excerpts from his autobiography are being serialised online.

Chapters posted over the past few days include material about Nilsen’s early life and his dead grandfather - which is used to justify his later crimes.

Postings suggest further material is due to be placed online today and over coming weeks.

It is known that copies of the autobiography have been taken out of prison, but it is not clear who is responsible for putting the material on the internet - or whether they are acting on the instructions of the killer.

Nilsen is denied access to the internet at Full Sutton maximum security prison near York.

Publication of the memoirs are sure to cause further pain for his victims’ families.

And last night a leading criminologist condemned the development.

Professor David Wilson, who has met Nilsen and read some of his writing, confirmed that the posts appear to ‘genuinely be the work of the serial killer’. 

He said he had reported the internet material to the governor of Full Sutton as soon as he became aware of it.

Prof Wilson, himself a former prison governor, added: ‘I received two volumes of his autobiography around seven years ago and read them. Then I destroyed them as there was no way they should be made public. I would describe them as pornographic in the manner they presented his crimes.

‘The man is a narcissist and is looking for attention. Whoever has posted this material is entirely wrong in their belief there is educational or criminological value in it. There is not.

‘It’s worrying that there’s a promise of even more material being published, especially if it describes his crimes. That would be very upsetting for any friends and relatives of his victims.’

Nilsen, 67, grew up in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire. After leaving school, he worked as a cook in the Army for 11 years before joining the Metropolitan Police for eight months, then taking a job in the civil service.

Between 1978 and 1983, he is believed to have killed at least 15 men and boys.

The first was 14-year-old Stephen Holmes, who was last seen on his way home from a rock concert.

Targeting mostly homosexuals or the homeless, Nilsen lured his victims to his North London home with offers of food, alcohol or shelter.

Having strangled or drowned them, Nilsen kept the bodies, sometimes placing them in his bed for company.

Eventually, he would dismember them and hide the remains, storing these under floorboards, in bin bags stuffed into a wardrobe, and even mixed with salt in a tea chest.

In 1983, Nilsen was found guilty of six murders and two attempted murders. He is believed to have killed nine other men but always claimed he could not remember their names.

The Home Office has said Nilsen will never be released.

In 1996 Nilsen wrote his life story, Nilsen: History Of A Drowning Man.

A copy was taken out of jail by his then solicitor, but publication was vetoed and the manuscript was not returned.

In 2003 Nilsen went to the High Court in London, claiming the book was his property and insisting that any proceeds from publication would go to charity.

But the then Home Secretary David Blunkett banned publication.

Nilsen went to the European Court of Human Rights two years ago claiming his writings ‘stimulated much academic and medical debate’ – the case was dismissed.

The Prison Service said: ‘The Court of Appeal upheld it was lawful for the Prison Service to withhold Dennis Nilsen’s manuscript so that he could not work on it for publication. This remains our position. 

‘Prisoners also have no access to the internet other than in controlled circumstances when supervised by staff, and it is a criminal offence to have a mobile phone in prison.’
