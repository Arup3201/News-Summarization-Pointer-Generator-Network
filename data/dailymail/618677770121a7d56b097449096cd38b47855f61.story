He is widely tipped for stardom in the future and it seems Chuba Akpom is wasting no time in smashing records at Arsenal.

The 18-year-old forward has broken the club's 10m sprint record, leaving the likes of Theo Walcott and Thierry Henry trailing.

Akpom, who has opened the season with four goals in three matches for the club's under 21 side, set a new benchmark of 1.56 seconds and revealed the news on Twitter.

He wrote: 'Club record in the 10m sprint: 1.56.'

Speed over short distances is essential for strikers and Akpom is certainly a highly-regarded member of Arsenal's emerging crop of talent as well as an England Under 20 international.

He underlined his potential in front of manager Arsene Wenger last week with a hat-trick as the Under 21 team beat West Brom 4-2 at the Emirates.

And it appears to be a matter of time before Akpom is given more minutes in the first team to add to the Capital One Cup outing he enjoyed against the Baggies last season.

One record he may now set his sights on is to be the fastest over 40m. Young right-back Hector Bellerin beat Theo Walcott's previous benchmark of 4.42 seconds, which had stood for five years, last month.

Waiting in the wings: Arsene Wenger has been watching Akpom's progress closely
