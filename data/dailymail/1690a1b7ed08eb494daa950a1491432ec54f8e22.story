He has been globe-trotting for 25 years and Michael Palin revealed yesterday he has no intention of stopping as it keeps him ‘up to the mark both mentally and physically’.

The 70-year-old actor and travel presenter who was on screen late last year in Brazil - the 96th destination he has visited, said the reason why he did it is not because he is interested in being famous per se, but in educating and entertaining people.

Responding to questions on Gransnet, a web forum for grandparents, the former Monty Python star said: “I always thought there’d be a time when I wanted to stop what I was doing and let others take over but I find as I get older I’ve learned more about the world, and I want to share it with people rather than sit in a chair and shut up.

Michael Palin, 70, has said that travel keeps him young, and he won't hang up his backpack just yet

“I’m not interested in celebrity as such, I’m interested in what I can bring to the rest of the world in terms of information, education and entertainment.

“And I think the wisdom of older people is really valuable.”

Age should be no barrier to anyone looking for travel adventures, he argued, “provided you’re careful and don’t try and run up and down Everest, or try and swim the Channel every afternoon.”

Palin began his career as a travel writer shortly after Python ended following its run from 1969 to 1974.

His journeys have taken him across the world including the North and South Poles, the Sahara Desert, the Himalayas, Eastern Europe and, most recently, Brazil.

He urged grandparents to try and be adventurous, as a “well-planned” journey could “lift your spirits” as you get older and have time to yourself.

“I’m 70 now, and I don’t think I shall ever stop traveling,” he said.

“It keeps me up to the mark both mentally and physically and the interaction with the rest of the world and the people I meet makes me feel that there is much more that unites us all, than divides us.

“This is a useful antidote to media stories which might give you the impression that the world is falling apart.”

Palin returned to television drama last month after a two-decade hiatus, with a part in The Wipers Times, a one-off BBC drama based on the true story of a satirical newspaper produced in the trenches of the First World War.

Earlier this year, in another interview, he credited his travels as the key to ensuring his marriage has survived 46 years.

He said his time away from his wife Helen has ensured the longevity of their union.

He said: ‘People say, ‘How on earth can you stay married when you are away for so long?’ That’s the way you stay married: because you are away.’

Explaining the dynamics of his relationship, and her ability to remain unimpressed by what he does, he said: ‘She [Helen] is not a great adventure traveller. We go to cities:New York, Barcelona, Antwerp. Bit more adventurous this year, went Oman. She doesn’t like needless suffering.’

She is however ‘extremely tolerant and very down-to-earth and never admits to being impressed by anything I do.

‘Occasionally, she’ll come along and listen to me talking and say, ‘That wasn’t bad but your collar looked a bit odd.’ The way partners should do really.’
