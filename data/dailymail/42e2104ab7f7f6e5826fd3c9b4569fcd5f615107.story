Package holidays are making a comeback with more families seeking value and financial security for when they travel abroad.

Figures released by travel association ABTA show nearly half - 48 per cent - of Brits went on an overseas package deal in 2012.

This is compared to 42 per cent in 2011 and 37 per cent in 2010.

Figures show package holidays abroad are making a comeback as hard-pressed families seek value and financial security for their annual break in the sun

The figures emerged as it was revealed that hard-up Britons took fewer holidays in the last year, dropping from 3.82 in the 12 months to September 2011 to 3.5 holidays in the same period to September 2012.

The 1970s were a heyday for package breaks as families jetted off to sunny destinations such as Spain but the arrival of the internet put an increasing dent in the market as holidaymakers went online to book their breaks.

According to the Office for National Statistics, 56 per cent of European holidays in 2000 were packages which had dropped to 39 per cent by 2007.

An ABTA spokesman said the figure in the 1970s was around the 60 per cent mark.

The figures also showed that domestic holiday packages, such as coach tours and rail breaks, were on the up, increasing to 23 per cent in 2012 compared to 12 per cent in 2011 and 14 per cent in 2010.

New figures released by travel association Abta showed 48 per cent of Brits booked a foreign package holiday this year, compared with 42 per cent in 2011 and 37 per cent in 2010

In comparison to the findings, there has been a slight decrease in the number of people organising DIY holidays – where they book their travel and accommodation separately.

A total of 39 per cent of those surveyed said they had booked a foreign trip themselves in 2012 which stood at 43 per cent in 2011.

Victoria Bacon, head of communications for ABTA, said consumers valued the ‘security and cost effectiveness that package holidays provide’.

She added: ‘At the same time the market has also evolved to offer greater choice to holidaymakers. It’s no longer just a week in Benidorm.

‘The market is now very sophisticated, with packages to cater for every taste and budget – whether you want two weeks all-inclusive in the sun, a cruise around Asia or an adventure holiday in South America.’

Ms Bacon also said holidaymakers had the choice of star ratings to tempt them, ‘plus an easy booking process and great value for money’.

ABTA research showed that the number of people booking an overseas holiday through a high street travel agent rose marginally in 2012, with 27 per cent booking compared to 25 per cent in 2011.
