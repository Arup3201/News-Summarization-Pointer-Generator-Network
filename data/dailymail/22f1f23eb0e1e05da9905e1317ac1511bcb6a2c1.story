A Mexican woman has got a lot on her hands after getting pregnant with an incredible nine babies.

The country's main broadcaster Televisa reported last night that  Karla Vanessa Perez is expecting six girls and three boys next month.

However, doubts have been cast over the claims after a local doctor came forward and said she recently performed an ultra-sound on Perez but her uterus was empty.

The doctor said the health authority would now be investigating the claims and planned to find out if Perez really is
pregnant, according to TMZ.

Perez, who already has triplets, was 
described as coming from the north-eastern state of Coahuila, which 
borders the U.S. state of Texas.

She claims she is being treated for the pregnancy at a hospital in the state capital Saltillo, the broadcaster said in the report.

Perez, whose age was not given, said she had fertility treatment with her husband Bernardo leading to the multiple pregnancy, it said.

State-owned news agency Notimex also reported the pregnancy, saying Perez was due to give birth on May 20.

'It's very early to think of names for the babies,' Perez told Notimex. 'First I hope that everything goes well.'  

The successful delivery of nonuplets would be one of the highest multiple births ever recorded.

In 2009, a woman in California gave birth to octuplets, sparking worldwide media attention.

Mother-of-14 Nadya Suleman, 36, from La Habra, was dubbed 'Octomum' has since become a television personality in the U.S..

However, since the birth of her eight new children she has faced problems and been close to being evicted from her home.

Her children are now being monitored by officials with the California Children's Services Department.

* EDITOR'S NOTE - While there is clearly room for debate about
the correct grammatical term for a woman who has nine children, the classicists
at MailOnline have insisted on using the ordinal Latin term, nona, meaning
ninth, rather than the cardinal alternative, novem, meaning nine, or indeed the
Greek, ennea.

Karla Vanessa Perez's children are not the first nonuplets to be born, but if they all live they will be the first to survive.

A set was born on June 13, 1971 in Sydney, Australia, to Geraldine Brodrick. None of the five boys and four girls lived. Two were stillborn and the last to survive died six days after birth.

Nonuplets were also born on March 26, 1999, in Malaysia to Zurina Mat Saad. She had five boys and four girls (Adam, Nuh, Idris, Soleh, Hud, Aishah, Khadijah, Fatimah and Umi Kalsom) but none of them survived more than six hours.

Nadya Suleman - or 'Octomum' - holds the world record for the most children delivered at a single birth to survive with her eight babies.

Before that, the record was held by Bobbie McCaughey, who gave birth to four boys and three girls in 1997 at the University hospital, Iowa in United State of America.

The greatest recorded number of children born to one mother in the world, according to Guinness is 69. In 27 pregnancies, the first wife of Feodor Vassilyev of Russia gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets in the 17th century.
