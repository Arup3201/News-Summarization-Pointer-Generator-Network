A husband who lashed out with an axe while angry at his wife has been spared jail - so the couple have the opportunity to reconcile their marriage.

Axe-wielding Richard Naisbitt, 52, from Stockton, County Durham, missed hitting his wife by inches after telling her he planned to 'unleash hell'.

Naisbitt had previously followed his wife to where she was staying, threatened to set the house on fire and told her he would see her 'in the afterlife', after she tried to end their 18-year marriage.

But Naisbitt was spared jail at Teesside Crown Court by a judge who thought there might be a chance of the pair making up.

Recorder Mark McKone handed Naisbitt a suspended sentence, saying he did not want to 'prevent the marriage reconciling' by putting the defendant behind bars.

He said Naisbitt - described as a law-abiding, hard-working man - had been punished enough from the four months he had spent in jail on remand for the crime.

He told the defendant: 'What you did was out 
of control and unpredictable and your wife must really have feared for 
her own life. She must have been terrified.

'I’m satisfied the suspended sentence order will make sure there’s no re-offending.

'Clearly I don’t want to prevent the marriage reconciling if that is at all possible.'

Naisbitt, who had six previous offences including an assault, admitted affray against his wife.

The court heard the incident took place after his wife had tried to end the couple's relationship.

But her husband refused to take no for an answer.

He threatened his wife and followed her to the family member's home where she was staying.

The former bricklayer told her he would see her 'in the afterlife', before driving off saying 'you'll be sorry'.

Then, on January 18, his wife returned to their marital home with a friend to pick up her pets.

Prosecutor Rachel Masters said the defendant armed himself with an axe and a screwdriver and started shouting at his wife.

The court heard he shouted: 'I’m going to get all of you one by one.'

He then threatened: 'I’m going to unleash hell. Lock me up if you like. I don’t care. I’ll just hit the gym and get big and get the lot of you', the court was told.

Naisbitt then hit the axe into a 
door frame, missing his wife by inches.

In court, the victim made it clear her husband was 
not trying to hit her. She said her husband had never hit her, but his drinking made him aggressive.

Naisbitt told police he had little memory of what happened because he was drunk.

The court heard he had been sectioned in 2008 for depression and had not been taking his medication for two years.

Defence barrister Paul Newcombe said Naisbitt was in a very emotional state.

He said the man did not consider himself to have a drinking problem but he hit the bottle when he had problems, which led to 'mayhem'.

The court heard Naisbitt had been remanded in custody for four months since the incident. He had not seen his wife in that time.

Mr Newcombe said: 'He doesn’t know whether it’s over.'

Recorder McKone gave Naisbitt an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with a one-year supervision order.

He warned the defendant not to knock on his wife’s door, but did not impose a restraining order.
