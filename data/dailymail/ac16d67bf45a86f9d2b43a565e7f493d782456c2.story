Amber's incredible beauty and unique ability to preserve fragments of history are the subject of a new exhibition at a Scottish museum.

Visitors to the National Museum of Scotland will be able to marvel at real-life pieces of history in the Amazing Amber exhibition - and the amber-topped cane from Jurassic Park that made the material famous.

The fossilised tree resin sometimes contains prehistoric insects and plant life caught in the sticky fluid millions of years ago.

Alongside hundreds of real pieces, the Edinburgh museum will also feature the iconic walking cane from the 1993 movie Jurassic Park, in which DNA retrieved from a mosquito trapped in amber was used to clone dinosaurs.

The exhibition explores the many facets of a beautiful and versatile material that has been treasured for thousands of years and reveals the origins, properties and uses of this precious substance.

It explores how scientists are continuing to make exciting new discoveries based on life forms preserved in amber.

Found all over the world, amber, fossilised tree resin, can vary widely in appearance and has many different uses.

On display will be pieces from across the globe, from Borneo to the Baltic, Sicily to Scotland.

Used for centuries as a decorative artefact, amber was also treasured for its perceived magical powers, crafted into charms and amulets to heal and ward off evil spirits.

Curator Dr Andrew Ross said: ‘The beauty of amber and the three-dimensional life forms captured inside many of the pieces tell us so much about our Earth’s incredible history.’

However, the exhibition debunks the science used in Jurassic Park to clone dinosaurs, even though it did lead to a rise in funding of extracting DNA from amber.

Dr Andrew Ross said: 'I used to work at the Natural History Museum and we did get funding to try to get insect DNA from amber but we weren’t successful.

'We’ve gathered a few bits of merchandise from Jurassic Park and we’ve got video clips from the film and will be explaining why the science behind it wouldn’t have worked,' he told The Scotsman.
