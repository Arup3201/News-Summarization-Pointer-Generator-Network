Rising numbers of teenagers are turning their backs on traditional  A-levels in favour of apprenticeships, Government figures show.

The number of 16 and 17-year-olds in apprenticeship schemes has risen by 15 per cent from 41,738 last year to 49,228 this year.

The Department for Education statistics come after a recent report by the Institute for Public Policy Research warned that the majority of teenagers are likely to be better prepared for the future workforce by shunning higher education in favour of practical, jobs-based training.

The Coalition has reformed apprenticeships – where students work towards nationally recognised qualifications while being paid – to make them a respected alternative to academic study.

It has allowed hundreds of employers including PwC, Microsoft, John Lewis, British Airways and BMW to develop the qualifications.

Skills minister Matthew Hancock said: 'There is no better 
engine of social mobility and success than a place in education or 
training.

'And today's figures confirm that young people across England 
are increasingly seeing apprenticeships as a great way to fulfil their 
potential.

'This confirms our reforms to give young people a clear path to work or further education are working.

'Further
 data published last month shows the lowest level of 16 to 18-year-olds 
Neet (not in education, employment or training) since records began - 
showing our long-term economic plan is delivering for young people.'
