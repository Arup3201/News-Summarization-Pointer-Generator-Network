Prince William cut a rather lonely figure on the green carpet tonight and admitted: ‘Kate would have loved to have been here.’

The prince arrived on his own as guest of honour at the UK premiere of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in London's Leicester Square after his pregnant wife was forced to pull out of because of her severe morning sickness.

On his arrival at 6.45pm he was met by the cinema's general manager Tessa Street on the bespoke 'green carpet' that had earlier been graced by the film's stars, including Care Blanchett and Martin Freeman.

Tessa said: ‘It's really exciting to have his support for the film and the charity.

‘I was a bit nervous being on my own to meet him, but he was very friendly.’

‘I passed on my best wishes to Kate and he said 'She would have loved to have been here if she could'.

‘He also commented on the green carpet and the staging.’

The 65th royal film screening was in aid of The Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund, which supports industry employees during times of hardship.

One of the fund's trustees Debbie Chalet joined a line-up to meet William as he arrived.

She said: ‘This is our biggest fundraising event of the year and it means so much to have the support of the royal family.

‘It's such a shame Kate couldn't be here as well.

‘I said to William 'Thank you for taking the time to come and be here tonight' because I'm sure he wants to be at home making sure Kate's OK.’

The prince also chatted to the film's director Sir Peter Jackson and stars including Sir Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, Elija Wood and Cate Blanchett .

He joked with Australian Cate: ‘When I go to Australia I'm always winding up the Kiwis and vice versa, you always get a reaction.’

The engagement was the fourth Kate has missed after being hospitalised last week with severe morning sickness and she is unlikely to be seen in public officially until at least Christmas.

William attended the Centrepoint Winter White's Gala on Saturday evening on his own, and said of his poorly wife: ‘I don’t know why they call it morning sickness – they should call it all day and all night sickness.

‘It’s a long old process but she is getting there.

‘She feels like it is going to go on forever.’

Sir Ian McKellan sent his best wishes to the Duchess before the performance, prompting a round of applause from the audience.

Kate,
30, who was hospitalised last week after developing hyperemesis 
gravidarum, a condition which leaves sufferers battling constant nausea 
and vomiting, suffered a relapse on Sunday and was deemed too ill to 
attend the charity gala.

Royal sources stressed there was no cause for alarm.

But
it is clear that the Duchess has been hit badly by the illness, which 
affects three in every one thousand pregnant women, and she will 
continue to rest quietly at their home in Kensington Palace for the 
foreseeable future.

A 
spokesman for the couple said yesterday: ‘The Duchess of Cambridge will 
not attend The Hobbit Premiere tomorrow evening and will continue to 
rest privately. The Duke of Cambridge will attend as planned. ‘

Kate, who is barely eight weeks 
pregnant, was hospitalised for three days last week after repeated 
vomiting left her severely dehydrated

She
was admitted to the King Edward V11 Hospital in London on Monday where 
her condition was stabilised by introducing fluids and nutrients via an 
intravenous drip.

She was finally sent home on Thursday morning with a batch of anti-sickness tablets - and strict instructions to rest.

On Sunday William was 
forced to cancel a planned appearance at the British Military Tournament
at Earl’s Court after she fell ill again.

At
this stage the Duchess's condition is not deemed serious enough to require 
further hospital treatment, but doctors are keeping a close eye on the 
Duchess to ensure she does not becomes dehydrated again.

A
St James's Palace spokesman said: ‘It is well known that hyperemesis 
gravidarum often recurs and, until further notice, to allow the Duchess a
degree of privacy during her pregnancy, we do not intend to offer 
regular condition checks or advise of routine developments associated 
with it.’

Hyperemesis gravidarum can cause such severe sickness and nausea that sufferers can even vomit blood.

It is thought to be caused by elevated levels of the ‘pregnancy hormone’ hCG, which the body begins to produce after conception.

The
condition tends to appear at around six to eight weeks into pregnancy 
and for most sufferers disappears towards the end of the first 
trimester.

But for some it can go on as long as five months into the pregnancy and, occasionally, right until birth.
