 Barcelona thanked Thomas Vermaelen for turning down Manchester United and reassured supporters his injury problems are behind him when the 28-year-old central defender was presented at the Camp Nou on Sunday.

Referring to United, Barcelona’s Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta said: 'He had offers from one of the biggest clubs in world football and we appreciate the fact that he chose to come here instead.'

Vermaelen added: 'This is one of the biggest clubs in the world so it was not a difficult decision to make. Everyone wants to play here and I’m not an exception.'

The player was asked numerous questions regarding his injury record but Zubizarreta defended the signing saying: 'We have no doubt about the fitness of Thomas. 

'He can play at left-back as well as in the centre of defence so he gives us a versatility that we will need over the long season. We have followed him for a long time because he is the type of player that fits the way we play.'

The player himself spoke of a ‘fresh start’ admitting that his last season at the Emirates had been difficult.

'I want to look forward not back and the desire is there to play a lot of games, I believe I can. Last year was disappointing with injuries but that happens sometimes in a long career. I hope that I will be stronger this season and play more games. I am ready and I feel I can offer the club a lot. I can’t wait to get started with training. This is a new beginning.' 

Vermaelen's former team-mates at Arsenal took to Twitter to wish him all the best.

Despite passing a medical on Saturday Barcelona admitted that the player arrives still carrying an injury from the World Cup that would be further assessed on Monday morning before an estimation would be put on when he can make his Barcelona debut.

The player added: 'I picked up an injury at the World Cup and have not trained with Arsenal so I will need a couple of weeks to get back to full fitness.

The club confirmed the deal is worth 15m euros with 3.8m euros in add-ons if Barcelona win the Champions League across the five years of his contract. 

The length of the player’s deal has also raised eyebrows in Barcelona but Zubizarreta said: 'He is only 28 and we think he can give us stability. He could be here for five years; he could be here for even longer. 

'He is a player for the here and now once he has got over his injury, and then he is here for the long term.'

Doubts: Barcelona chiefs moved to reassure fans over Vermaelen's injury record

Vermaelen is the first out-and-out centre back Barcelona have signed in five years but the club also made a point of mentioning his ability to play as a left-back.

Vermaelen said: 'I prefer to play in the centre of defence but occasionally I have played as a full-back.

'The fact that I’ve played at Arsenal will help. I don’t think the style here is that different so that will be an advantage. I was at Ajax before and they also look to play the ball on the ground.'

Barcleona have also signed the defender, who won only an FA Cup at Arsenal but a league and two cups at Ajax, for his ability in the air and he said: 'I feel that I am very good in the air and that is something else I can offer.'

Asked about his new defensive team-mates and about his former Ajax team-mate Luis Suarez, he said: 'The defenders who are already here are very good but you know that will be case when you join a big club.

'Luis is a great player as every has seen first at Ajax and then in Liverpool. Everyone knows what quality he has. As a person I knew him at Ajax and my experience was that he is a nice guy. I still haven’t spoken to him but hope to soon.'
