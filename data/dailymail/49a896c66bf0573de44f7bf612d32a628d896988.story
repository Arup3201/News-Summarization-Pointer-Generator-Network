John Guidetti is exposing the inside of his arm. The skin from the sleeve of his designer t-shirt down to his right hand is embedded with tattoos painted in green ink.

Amongst young footballers this is the norm. The in-thing. Laughing, the Swedish international says his mother disapproves, but rejects any accusations of vanity or pandering to dressing-room culture.

Instead he points in the direction of some lyrics embedded in his upper from a song by Jamaican reggae artist Tarrus Riley.

‘Everything here is history to do with injuries,’ he explained. ‘The lyrics here are from a song I listened to in my dark times. I don’t think you’ll know the song but it says “We all cry but when the tears dry we get stronger.”’

Later, a Google check reveals that the song is titled ‘Stronger.’

After two years of abject frustration and doubt, a period which drained the overflow of self confidence which spills from Celtic’s new on-loan new striker, Guidetti uses them to reinforce his belief that bad things happen for a reason.

It was his 20th birthday when his girlfriend and some friends organised a surprise party. He felt on top of the world. An outstanding season of hero worship on loan at Feyenoord had brought 20 goals in 23 appearances and the kind of adulation which can turn a young man’s head.

Midway through the night he felt ill and left early. It might have been a piece of chicken he ate, but a 10-day stomach bug was violent and unforgiving. 

He lost his balance and doctors carried out further tests, discovering the antibodies inside his stomach were attacking the nervous system. He lost all strength in his leg and surrendered his sense of balance.

The Swedish striker Guidetti was told by Manuel Pellegrini that he should leave City to further his career

There were times, surely, when he thought his career was over.

‘Not over,’ he responds, a crumpled Celtic No 9 shirt in hand. ‘I always knew I’ d come back but I didn’t know how long it would take.

‘It’s made me stronger. Maybe when I’m old and wise I’m going to sit there and think it was a great thing that happened to me. You see many of these young players whose careers go from nothing to wow in a matter of seconds, it’s easy to fly away and think you’re better than you are.

‘Maybe you forget to go into the gym before training or stay out after for extra minutes.

‘Football goes quickly if you don’t keep on top of it. So maybe this was meant to be and I try to stay on top of my game and not fly away. Even if I have a great performance I keep working hard and stay motivated. This was meant to be.’

In his national team colours John Guidetti has continued to shine despite his injury troubles

In total he missed two years of football. Reared playing street football on the outskirts of Nairobi, Guidetti could cope because he has a background and intelligence unusual in a footballer.

‘It was a difficult time. It was a leg injury, I don’t know the exact medical terms but it kept me out for a long time. It stopped me going to the European Championships in 2012.

‘I had a great season in Holland, my career was looking bright to say the least. Then this injury came.

‘It was a virus. I think they say 1 in 10 million people get it. I’m not sure what it was but it was unfortunate to get it at such a time. To play with my national team in Ukraine would have been amazing.

‘But it wasn’t meant to be, so we’ll go for France instead.

‘If you give up then I don’t think you deserve to be a footballer because it’s the greatest thing in the world. I’m not going to give up now.’

Even so, there were some bleak, desperate days.

Guidetti scored a stunning free-kick for Sweden Under 21s last week as he continued his return to form

‘It was the darkest time ever,’ he reflected, ‘But I got a great help from City’ s medical team and the close people around me. They always believed in me to come back.’

A stunning strike for Sweden’s under-21 side in a 3-0 win over Greece in midweek suggested he is on his way. But the Glasgow jury is harsher than most. Guidetti may be fit, but a loan to Stoke City last season was unsatisfactory for both parties.

At Parkhead, Guidetti feels compelled to show he still has the explosive ability which persuaded Roberto Martini to sign him for Manchester City.

‘What’s unfair is that I did well then I was injured for two years,’ he says of suggestions he has failed to fulfil his early promise. 

‘I had an unfortunate spell at Stoke. But again I was never really given a chance. If I’d played 10 games for no goals then fine, that would’ve been a chance not taken.

‘But to come off the bench, for 10 minutes here and there, is difficult.

‘Look at the games I’ve played lately. I played four games for the national team under-21s and I’ve scored four goals. That I think is not bad.’

As a teenager he loved Henrik Larsson. After some talk he won’t take the fabled No 7 shirt of his countryman, but the legacy of Celtic’s modern-day icon was a powerful incentive to reject the likes of Ajax and Olympiakos.

‘That’s one of the reasons. Not Henrik’s legacy but the fact he stayed for so many years, scoring goals after goals after goals. If you score so many goals and have such a big impact as he did later in his career, when he went to United and Barcelona, for him to choose to stay so many years it must be an amazing club.

‘I’ve never heard anything bad about it. I remember some of the boys in the dressing room at City said on a Champions Leauge night Celtic Park is the best atmosphere in the world.’

These are changed days, of course. Celtic crowds in the Europa League will be a source of intrigue. Guidetti’s capture, albeit on loan, went some way towards offering an olive branch to a support disenfranchised by a perceived lack of spending from the boardroom.

Yet the Swede’s enthusiasm is infectious. Here is a player hellbent on bringing them all back.

Guidetti was out for two years with various troubles including a virus that affects one in ten million people

‘Nothing negative entered my mind about Scottish football. I am at one of the biggest clubs in the world.

‘I’m a bit of a freak when it comes to fans. I love fans.

‘Take them away and what is football, really? It’s not the same, nowhere near.

‘It’s the feeling to score in front of 50,000 fans is incredible. It’s hard to describe. For me it’s the best feeling in the world.’

He ducks questions on a permanent stay. His Man City contract is up next summer. He could sign an agreement with Celtic in January if he wished, but the events of recent years make predictions and assumptions a dangerous business for John Guidetti.

‘Manuel Pellegrini said to me: “John listen, for your own best and your career you need to play. To be fourth choice here is not going to cut it for you.”’

‘I felt the same. I want to play football and to play for Celtic is great. That’ s all I’m thinking about. I can’t think too much ahead. I have to stay focused.’
