It is quite a way to start your day.

Astronaut Reid Wiseman today tweeted this incredible image of his view when he woke up - the sun rising over the curvature of the Earth.

'Tough to beat a good sunrise – on Earth or in low earth orbit,' he told his 262,000 followers.

'Tough to beat a good sunrise – on Earth or in low earth orbit,' US astronaut Reid Wiseman told his 262,000 followers.

The station crew sees, on average, sixteen sunrises and sunsets during a 24-hour orbital period. 

Each changeover between day and night on the ground is marked by the terminator, or line separating the sunlit side of Earth from the side in darkness. 

While the terminator is conceptualized as a hard boundary--and is frequently presented as such in graphics and visualizations--in reality the boundary between light and dark is diffuse due to scattering of light by Earth’s atmosphere.

This zone of diffuse lighting is experienced as dusk or twilight on the ground--while the sun is no longer visible, some illumination is still present due to light scattering over the local horizon.

In a trend pioneered by Canadian ISS commander Chris Hadfield, new recruits are now tweeting regularly from orbit.

Astronaut Reid Wiseman, who is currently aboard the station, is a prolific snapper, along with his German colleague Alexander Gerst. 

Earlier this week Wiseman tweeted this image, saying 'Good morning from #space'

'My favorite views from #space – just past #sunrise over the ocean' Wiseman tweeted along with this snap on 2nd September.

The pair have even developed their own styles, with Gerst preferring abstract patterns on the Earth's surface, while Wiseman favours storms and cities.

Recently Gerst took part in a live Facebook Q&A to answer questions from people on Earth.

One included Sir Richard Branson, who asked: 'What do you think the role of astronauts will be in 50 years' time? Pioneers? Guides? Or the norm?'

Gerst responded: 'My hope would be that in 50 years from now, space travellers will not only be professional agency astronauts, but that everybody should have a realistic chance to make the incredible experience I am having right now.

'Anyway, I hope there will still be pioneers out there who will fly to destinations farther away.'

On Saturday, June 11, 2011, International Space Station astronaut Ron Garan used a high definition camera to film one of the sixteen sunrises astronauts see each day. This image shows the rising sun as the station flew along a path between Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
