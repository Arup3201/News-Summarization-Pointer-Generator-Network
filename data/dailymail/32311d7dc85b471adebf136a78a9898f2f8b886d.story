Jamie Oliver's bespoke butchers was forced to close after inspectors found mouse droppings, mouldy carcasses and out-of-date wagyu beef.

Barbecoa, next to St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London, shut down for 24 hours when officers gave it the worst possible hygiene rating - branding it 'hazardous'.

Mould was found growing on carcasses in the basement chillers and expensive meats including wagyu beef, oxtail, onglet, and Spanish-style pork called lomo de cana.

Dirty slicers and vacuum packers were also found, as well as a 'heavy presence' of mouse droppings.

Old chicken which had been de-boned and vacuum packed was found to be relabelled with a later use-by date.

Blasting the conditions, inspectors also noted that there was no safety management in place.

The shop supplies meat for Oliver's restaurant upstairs, which he opened in 2010 with American chef Adam Perry Lang.

Boasting a quality of meat that is 'second to none', the website touts the artisan butchery beneath as the best in Britain.

A meal at the restaurant can set you back around £100. The menu offers beef tartare and seven kinds of steak

Barbecoa, which Oliver launched in 2010 with American chef Adam Perry Lang, is 'Britain's first ever barbecue steak house', according to the website.

The restaurant menu features beef tartare, crispy pig cheeks, a seven different steak options. To drink, there are £10 New York-style cocktails.

Diners can douse their chosen meat with additional blue cheese butter or black truffle gravy.

A meal costs around £100.

Downstairs, the butchery acts as a shop, offering bespoke cuts of beef, lamb, pork and chicken.

However, it is one of just 12 food 
outlets of 1,659 in the City of London to receive an 'A hazardous' 
rating from the Food Standards Agency.

A spokesman for the Jamie Oliver Group 
claims the details, which emerged from a Freedom of Information request 
by The Times, did not make the food 'unfit for consumption', adding that
 the butchers closed voluntarily.

Addressing the mould on the carcasses, she said: 'The dry ageing of meat on the bone encourages the natural formation of mould and this is common practice in butcheries.'

The scandal is the latest of many to plague the celebrity chef's restaurant empire.

In May last year, the Portsmouth branch of his successful Jamie's Italian chain was forced to pay £17,000 after pleading guilty to breach of the Food Safety Act.

The case came a year after staff were filmed pointing and laughing at dying mice in the Edinburgh branch.

Recently, the branch London's Square Mile was berated by hygiene inspectors for poor staff cleanliness and access to washing facilities - scoring a two out of five.

Out-of-date food has since been found at a Canary Wharf branch and raw burgers at an Oliver eatery in Leeds.

It comes after Jamie Italian's in Portsmouth was fined for breaching the Food Safety Act last year

A spokesman for the Jamie Oliver Group said: 'Following the EHO inspection in January we took the immediate decision to voluntarily close the butchery for several hours in order to urgently address the issues raised.

'We reopened within 24 hours and the EHO noted that the improvements had been made.

'We have since continued to receive very positive feedback from the EHO with regards to all improvements and we are confident that the butchery will achieve a high rating in its next inspection.

'Issues such as this are extremely rare within the JO Restaurant Group and are treated with the upmost severity. The group has a Primary Authority Partnership, regulated under the government's Better Regulation Delivery Office (BRDO) which shows our recognition and commitment to maintaining high food safety standards throughout the business.'
