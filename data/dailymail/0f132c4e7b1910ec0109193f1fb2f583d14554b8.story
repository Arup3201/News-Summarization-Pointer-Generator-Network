For most, cosmetics are a big part of their daily routine, especially women.

Few other consumer products are directly applied to our bodies in the way cosmetics are, so it's a wonder, how safe are they really?

Well not as safe as some might think with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission finding that cosmetics actually accounted for around 30 per cent of injury reports in the past year.

Thousands of Australians every year are being injured from wrongly labelled products, with some consumers succumbing to severe allergic reactions.

'We see skin infections, bacterial conjunctivitis, folliculitis, corneal ulcers and anaphylactic shocks, which is why ingredients labelling is very important indeed,' deputy chair of the ACCC Delia Rickard told the Canberra Times.

The ACCC receives mandatory injury reports when a supplier becomes aware that a product has or may have caused death, serious injury or illness. 

The consumer watchdog also does regular surveys on cosmetic products and is, this year focusing on products which have no ingredient labelling and where ingredient labelling is in a language other than English. 

It says the cosmetic labelling standard helps consumers identify ingredients that they may be allergic or sensitive to.

'People who make and supply cosmetic products need to be fully aware of their responsibilities,' said Ms Rickard. 

'An inaccurate list of ingredients, or a product without a label could see consumers with allergies exposed to harm.'

'Where we identify non-compliance with the cosmetics labelling standard, we will speak with the suppliers and enforcement action will be seriously contemplated.'

During 2012-13, the ACCC started an audit of cosmetic-related injury reports received during 2011.

The main observations from that, were many of the reports involved injuries from face washes, creams, body wash products and creams and deodorants.

It also found that while labelling was generally good, some products had ingredient labelling that was inconsistent.

In mid-2013 the ACCC also investigated whether microbiological contamination may be to blame for some of the reported injuries.

A survey of products sold in Australia saw three out of 112 products tested returned high microbial counts.

The Canberra Times reported, lab tests of products found Nude by Nature Liquid Mineral Foundation, Australian Lavender Essentials Eye Cream and Australian Lavender Essentials Face Up Moisturiser had dangerous levels of microbial contamination, leading to their recall. 

'It is a timely reminder as the trend to produce all natural and all organic products may increase pressure on manufacturers to produce cosmetics with less preservatives or less effective natural preservatives,' said Ms Rickard.

This year, The ACCC conducted a specialised survey on popular deodorants.

It came after a consumer made a complaint about an allergy to one particular deodorant ingredient.  

It was found that ingredient labels on some deodorants were not prominent or legible as they were required to be.

Talking at the Accord Cosmetic and Personal Care conference in Sydney this week, Ms Rickard said all consumers needed to be assured that every manufacturer, importer or retailer in Australia was doing the right thing when it cames to the sale of their product.

'Investing in good quality assurance processes means you can be confident that the products you sell are safe and fit for purpose,' she said.

The ACCC hopes through findings and studies, they can ensure safer products and accurate marketing claims in the cosmetic industry

That also includes claims, or false claims, about their product.

'Companies should not claim products are of a particular quality or standard when they are not.'

'Credence claims may relate to the presence or absence of an ingredient (i.e. formaldehyde free), product safety (i.e allergy tested) or the moral or social benefits of a product (i.e cruelty free, not tested on animals).'

'Consumers cannot judge the truthfulness of claims made about products and they rely on suppliers to provide accurate and truthful information.' 

In July, Fair Trading raided two Sydney CBD retail sites and one Western Sydney warehouse, after a tip-off that they were dealing in counterfeit cosmetics, including the world renowned Mac brand. 

NSW Fair Trading Minister Matthew Mason-Cox said more than 8,000 counterfeit products were seized as a result of the raids.

'Alarmingly, one complainant reported experiencing burns to her face after using the counterfeit products,' he said.

'Others reported that it was not until the product packaging had been opened that it became obvious they had purchased a fake due to a different colour and consistency to the genuine article.' 

The ACCC hopes through these findings and studies, they can ensure safer products and accurate marketing claims in the cosmetic industry.
