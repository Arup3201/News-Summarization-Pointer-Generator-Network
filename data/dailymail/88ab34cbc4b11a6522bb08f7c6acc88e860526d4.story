Premier League chief Richard Scudamore’s reward for delivering another astonishing TV rights deal for the clubs could be the executive chairmanship.

A decision on that role is expected before the next PL meeting in March. And the timing couldn’t be better for Scudamore, with the clubs wanting to show their gratitude for £5billion coming their way from domestic deals alone.

Scudamore’s promotion is said to have the support of up to 10 clubs already. And the PL’s nomination panel led by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, who had been expected to recommend the in-house option at the pre-Christmas clubs’ meeting, have not been in a hurry to appoint anyone else.

Anthony Fry has been unable to fulfil the chairman’s role since suffering a serious stroke last March. And it is not ideal for the interim chairman, Harrogate lawyer Peter McCormick, to stay at the helm much longer when the PL are his prime clients.

If Scudamore does become chairman, the PL are expected to appoint a robust independent director — not before time — to ensure King Richard doesn’t get everything his own way. 

John Inverdale, who presents the BBC’s Six Nations rugby coverage, is in pole position to do the same job for ITV during the World Cup. Inverdale is better known for his BBC work, but also hosts French Open tennis on ITV and looks to have recovered his reputation since the furore around his observation on 5 Live that 2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli was ‘never going to be a looker’.

There has been the utmost secrecy around the Premier League TV rights tender from the start, with confidentiality contracts signed by all involved. But with Sky Sports and BT splitting the rights, how much easier - and vastly cheaper - it might have been if the TV network CEOs, Jeremy Darroch and Gavin Patterson, whose children attend the same school in Weybridge, had agreed a price between them on the school run.

The mystery over manager Nigel Pearson’s sacking and reinstatement by Leicester might be a lot more straightforward than reported. Perhaps the Thai owner was intent on dismissing Pearson until he realised it would have left nobody qualified to take charge for Tuesday night’s defeat at Arsenal.

The FA’s flawed anti-discrimination policy, that saw referee grandee David Elleray only rapped over the knuckles for a racist comment and manager Malky Mackay expected to escape punishment despite an exchange of racist and sexist texts, is also evident at grassroots level.

Winchester City Youth were only fined £45 by the Hampshire FA after numerous complaints that the mother of one of their players had yelled ‘shut up you monkey’ at a mixed race youngster from AFC Totton.

The mother escaped censure after her son moved to another club. Totton youth manager Shawn Kitcher said: ‘It’s scandalous a parent can get away with making such an appalling racist comment which shocked all who heard it.’

The mother insisted she had called the player a ‘cheeky little monkey’. The FA say spectators at parks are outside their jurisdiction.

There could be light at the end of the tunnel in David Beckham’s long search for a home for his Miami Major League Soccer franchise. Beckham’s two waterfront proposals have been strongly resisted but the Miami-Dade County commissioner is now backing building a stadium next to the Marlins baseball venue.

 It is on the site of the former Orange Bowl and could utilise Marlins car parking spaces. The Beckham build will be privately funded, as there is still plenty of resentment in Miami about the amount of taxpayers’ money spent on the Marlins stadium.

With everything involving Sepp Blatter under great scrutiny ahead of the FIFA presidential election in May, his nephew Philippe selling sports marketing company Infront Sports & Media to the Chinese for €1bn will be closely analysed - especially as InFront benefit from being FIFA’s broadcast rights agents in 26 Asian territories for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
