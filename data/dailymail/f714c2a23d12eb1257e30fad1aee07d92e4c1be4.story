Life of luxury: UKIP leader Nigel Farage is using taxpayers' money to pay for a swanky penthouse suite in Brussels, it has been revealed

UKIP leader Nigel Farage has come under fire for using taxpayers' money to pay for a swanky penthouse suite in Brussels.

The Euro MP, who has previously criticised the European Union for its wastefulness, is renting the luxury property in one of the most exclusive addresses in the Belgian capital.

It is thought to be worth a staggering £500,000 - featuring two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a garage and a private cellar.

It even boasts cleaners and a porter, while a balcony offers incredible views of Brussels's skyline.

The 49-year-old sleeps in the taxpayer-funded suite, which is owned by a Dutch diplomat, twice a month, according to The Sun on Sunday.

This is despite him previously delivering vehement attacks on the EU 'gravy train' - slamming the excesses of European politicans as wasteful and unnecessary.

The suite, situated on the top floor of a 15-storey block, built in the 1930s, is within walking distance of the European Union Parliament and a number of posh bars and restaurants.

It is owned by the family of Dutch ambassador to the Philippines, Gijsbert Anton Boon Von Ochssee.

Today, Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, condemned Mr Farage's use of taxpayer's money to pay for the luxury accommodation in Brussels.

He told MailOnline: 'After the public outcry over MPs' expenses back in 2009, it is high time that MEPs were subject to the same scrutiny over how they are spending taxpayers' hard-earned cash.

'MEPs
 clearly need a place to stay when they are representing their 
constituents in Brussels, but they must make arrangements that offer 
best value for taxpayers' money.

'If
 some MEPs are only staying overnight in Belgium a couple of nights each
 month, several questions are sure to pop into people's minds: if they 
are doing the job properly, shouldn't they be in Brussels for more then 
two nights a month, and if they are only staying overnight twice a 
month, wouldn't it be cheaper to stay in a hotel?'

Last night, Mr Farage, who earns a hefty £77,000 salary plus expenses, said he only stayed in the penthouse suite while working in Brussels as an MEP.

'I do occasionally stay there,' he said. 'The alternative would be a smart hotel'.

He added that he did not have a 
rental deal in his name with anyone - and did not know whose name the 
suite's rental agreement was in. Mr Boon Von Ochssee was unavailable for comment.

Mr
 Farage is believed to have previously shared the apartment with former 
UKIP colleague, Godfrey Bloom, 64, who reportedly moved out after losing
 the party's whip in September last year.

It
 comes as the Euro MP has vehemently denied having sex with his aide 
Annabelle Fuller, whom he was alleged to have been involved with.

Mr Farage spoke out after it was claimed UKIP press officer Ms Fuller was his 'former mistress', and he was using public funds to employ her and his German wife and £25,000-a-year assistant, Kirsten Farrage,

He also dismissed claims that his 14-year marriage to Mrs Farage is in trouble as a result of recent headlines about his 
so-called ‘womanising’.

MailOnline has contacted Mr Farage for further comment.
