Some of the world's greatest players will be in Brazil and match-winners will be plentiful. Jamie Redknapp picks his 10 to watch at the World Cup.

HE must be hurting with people saying he’s not the best player in the world anymore. I’ve never seen him walk around the pitch as much as this season at Barcelona — he needs to up his tempo. If he does, he can do what Maradona did and win the tournament for his country. Rumour has it he’s been saving himself for this — let’s hope it’s true.

Up the tempo: Rumour has it Lionel Messi has been saving himself for the World Cup - he must deliver

I was unsure about the Brazil star for a while, but he had a fantastic Confederations Cup last summer, devastatingly good.

There is more pressure on him than any other player at the World Cup: he’s the pin-up, the home talent, the hope of a nation.

It’s not a vintage Brazil side but he is the one man who can produce a moment of genius.

Pin-up: There is a lot of pressure on Neymar and he will hope to repeat  his Confederations Cup displays

The player of the year’s confidence will be sky high after winning the Champions League. If he catches fire, Portugal have half a chance of doing very well.

The Real Madrid forward can score any way — left foot, right foot, headers and free kicks — and is backed up by an organised Portugal side that is used to the heat.

Sky-high confidence: And if Cristiano Ronaldo catches fire, Portugal could do very well

Yes, he dives but Robben has so much ability and skill. Louis van Gaal wants to play him centrally instead of on the wing and he could thrive there.

Good players need to be in the game, not peripheral figures on the wing. Playing in the middle will allow him to produce more magic.

Central figure: Holland might play Arjen Robben through the middle so he can influence games

If he’s fit, he will terrorise England and anybody he plays against. He’s an absolute phenomenon who is capable of doing things no-one else can.

It will be a real shame if he’s not quite right as the World Cup needs him on fire.

But I’ve had knee operations and know it  can take a while to feel 100 per cent.

Phenomenon: The World Cup needs a fit-and-firing Luis Suarez, who is capable of doing outrageous things

I love watching him. He makes Spain tick with his ability to outpass or outdribble his opponent from midfield.

Manipulates the ball so well, seeing a different game to everybody else. Is a step  ahead of everyone.

If Diego Costa is fit and Iniesta can feed him, Spain will be so dangerous again.

The manipulator: Andres Iniesta makes Spain tick and will be the main supply line to Diego Costa

I was never a fan of his at Manchester City because he was poison in the dressing room. In some ways, I’m not sure why I’m picking him on this list.

But the AC Milan striker is still box office and you never know what he is going to do.

His pace and power will cause trouble for England’s defenders and Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill will be hoping he is not in the starting XI.

Was Italy’s star when they reached the Euro 2012 final and will either destroy his own team or the opposition. Watch this space.

Pace and power: Mario Balotell is capable of destroying opponents... and his own side

He is either going to set the tournament alight or get dropped. This is the biggest tournament of his England career.

Rooney has never scored at a World Cup and  that’s not good enough for a man of his ability. He can produce the magic England will need to  get out of such a tough group.

No middle ground: Wayne Rooney will either set the World Cup alight or be dropped by England

Croatia have got lots of good technical players, but Rakitic is the best of the bunch. A skilful playmaker, he dribbles well and was hugely impressive in the Europa League final for Sevilla. He will surprise people in Brazil and could earn himself a big move after the World Cup.

Best of the bunch: Playmaker Ivan Rakitic is Croatia's star and may surprise some people in Brazil

Hazard started the season looking like a world beater and ended it fading away and falling out with Jose Mourinho.

The Chelsea playmaker needs to bounce back and inspire this very exciting Belgium team.

He has the ability to go from standing still to sprinting in the blink of an eye, which makes him horrible to play against.

One criticism would be that he needs to add more goals to his game — he only managed one from open play in his last 16 games of the season. Now is a good time to start.

Bounce back: Eden Hazard was brilliant at the start of last season but faded away towards the end

Lionel Messi (Argentina)......................7/1

Neymar (Brazil)......................................12/1
