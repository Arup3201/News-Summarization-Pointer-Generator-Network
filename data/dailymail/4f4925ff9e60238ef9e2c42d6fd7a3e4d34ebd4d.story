A huge manhunt has been launched for Briton Gareth Huntley, who disappeared while trekking in remote Malaysian jungle almost a week ago.

The British Government urged the country’s authorities to redouble their efforts after the family of the 34-year-old charity volunteer from London said the response had been ‘incredibly slow.’ 

His mother Janet Southwell had said she 
feared her son may be injured and unable to move and called on Prime Minister David 
Cameron to put pressure on the Malaysians to do more.

Yesterday a professional search team 
was deployed on the island of Tioman, including ten paramilitary 
commandos, five police officers, three guides with search dogs, a fire 
and rescue team, two boats and a helicopter.

Mr
 Huntley left the headquarters of the Juara Turtle Project, where he was
 working, on May 27 to hike through the jungle. He told staff he would 
be back that afternoon but failed to return.

‘We need boots on the ground, search teams and dogs so that we can bring our son back alive,’ Ms Southwell said.

She has urged Mr Cameron to 'make one phone call' to the country's leader 'before time runs out'.

Ms Southwell said 'real help' was needed to find Mr Huntley, who told 
friends at the headquarters of the charity project that he would return 
by 2pm the same day but failed to come back.

His mother wrote 
to Mr Cameron: 'As a father, you know that we'd do anything for our 
children and so I'm humbly asking that you make one phone call to help 
my missing son, Gareth.'

And
 she added: 'Please do the right thing Prime Minister and make one phone
 call to the Malaysian leader to insist that they deploy real help to 
find Gareth before time runs out. He is out there in the jungle and he 
needs help.

'We've been 
hugely heartened by the public's fantastic support so far but we 
urgently need firm action from the Government - not standard press 
assurances of 'working with authorities'.

We need boots on the ground, 
search teams and dogs so that we can bring our son back alive.

'As our Prime Minister I write to you but as a mother too, I hope you'll help me.'

She told Sky News that the police response had been 'incredibly slow'.

She
 said: 'The locals were, apparently, brilliant. They were out, very 
quickly, looking, searching as best they could, through terrain which 
they obviously know very well, but from what we understand the police 
response was incredibly slow.'

She
 said it was out of character for him to go missing. 'He's got an 
exploring nature, he's intelligent, and hopefully his ability to apply 
himself will get him through this.

'He
 was on a break from work, he was due to start a new job in Singapore 
next week. It's totally out of character for him to go missing, he just 
would not do it. He knows there are too many people who care and love 
him.'

Mr Huntley's girlfriend Kit Natariga has now arrived on the island, while his mother is also making the trip there.

Miss Natariga admitted time to find him was 'running out'. She told Sky News: 'It's really tough coming onto the island, we're in a bit of a helpless state. We cannot give up... time is running out.'

She said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'The Defence Secretary, who is in Malaysia, has spoken to the Malaysian Defence Minister this morning to confirm that all available search assets are used to find Gareth Huntley.

'He was assured that the Malaysian authorities would do all they could to locate him and had already deployed significant assets including dogs, boats and a helicopter.

'The Government will continue to work with the Malaysian authorities to ensure there is a comprehensive search.'

The missing man's 
brother, Mark Huntley, a 30-year-old web developer from Leeds, said: 'The media response has been hugely appreciated but we need real 
action now to find Gareth.

'Gareth's
 been missing now for five days and he's alone in the jungle. This was a
 man working out there as a wildlife volunteer - he deserves our 
assistance.'

Fellow volunteer Charles 
Fisher said a group went to search for him after he did not return from 
the 'huge wilderness'.

They 
checked various different routes to the waterfall 6km away that he might
 have taken, while a further search the next day also proved fruitless.

'It's
 a huge wilderness out there - a remote location. He could have taken a 
wrong turn and just got lost in another valley'

Mr
 Fisher added: 'Then the afternoon of the second day the police were 
informed - they sent a couple of members of the police force along to 
have a look but didn't go far or look very much - they were just sort of
 assessing the situation.

'Then
 the next day, the 29th, a group of volunteers went out and looked then 
came back again. Another group from the local community also went out as
 well and went deep into the jungle. The police were no longer 
physically looking at that point - I think they were arranging for a 
search party but nothing happened that day.

'Then
 today we've just been hoping the state police will do a proper search 
but nothing has happened yet. I don't know what's going on.

'It's
 a huge wilderness out there - a remote location. He could have taken a 
wrong turn and just got lost in another valley - we just don't know. The
 trouble is the police probably don't have proper search equipment - 
they need extra support.'

A Facebook group has been set up to raise awareness about Mr Huntley's disappearance.

Speaking following the meeting with Malaysian defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein - currently also investigating the disappearance of flight MH370 - Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond said: 'I raised the ongoing search on Tioman Island with the Malaysian government to check they have all the resources they require.

'They assure me that they do and that they are doing everything they can to find Gareth. We will continue to keep in regular contact with the Malaysian civil authorities leading the search.'
