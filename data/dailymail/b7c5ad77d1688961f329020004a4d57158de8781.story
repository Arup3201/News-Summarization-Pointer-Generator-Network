British television coverage of the Russian Grand Prix — the most security-conscious race ever staged — could go blank moments before Vladimir Putin arrives at the Sochi Autodrom on Sunday.

The BBC and Sky have been warned that Russian security forces will scramble radio frequencies to block any potential bomb being activated by these means. Radio microphones and cameras would no longer be able to function, possibly putting both networks briefly off air.

BBC’s Formula One editor Mark Wilkin confirmed: ‘The worst scenario would be if we are live and got no warning about when they will interfere with the frequencies. Then we could go blank for a moment. But we have a contingency plan. We will have cameras that are not reliant on radio frequencies to take over and could go to tape instead.’

Radar guarding against a threat from the skies could also cause white speckles to appear on the screen.

In another security measure, TV crews have been warned not to put their cameras too close to Putin as he accompanies his friend Bernie Ecclestone and the King of Bahrain, who is here for talks, around this shiny new circuit on the Black Sea coast.

Putin’s lichniki — his guards from the Presidential Security Service, an offshoot of the old Soviet KGB — will be poised to intervene. Let’s hope someone has told the not noticeably shy Eddie Jordan, who will conduct the grid walk for the BBC.

Security has been increased because of the war in Ukraine, and assassination fears are now greater than during the Winter Olympics here in February. So on the way into the circuit, there are armed guards and airport-style screening — rare for Formula One if not most other global sports events. There will also be 500 Cossack warriors protecting public order, 180 of them in the giant grandstand opposite the garages.

These precautions add a faintly sinister dimension to a grand prix that already has been lent a maudlin air by last week’s accident in Japan that has left Marussia driver Jules Bianchi clinging to life.

Lewis Hamilton was fastest in the second session for this weekend's inaugural Russian Grand Prix 

Hamilton, 10 points ahead of Nico Rosberg in the championship, topped the timesheets on Friday afternoon 

Formula One is making its inaugural foray into Russia. Hamilton set the pace in the second session 

Both team-mates at Marussia and Ferrari, where he is on their young driver programme, are sleep-starved through anxiety. Their desperation tells us that Formula One’s younger generation are not hardened to serious injury and death at the track.

On Friday, the FIA held a press conference in which Charlie Whiting, the race director, defended the way he conducted the Japanese Grand Prix, in which Bianchi hit a tractor that was recovering another car.

Whiting did, however, highlight some areas that would be addressed by a powerful FIA safety commission: a possible speed limit during yellow-flag phases, a re-examination of whether canopies should be fitted to cockpits, a study of helmet strength, and a study into whether skirts should be fitted around tractors.

Ideally we should be talking about Lewis Hamilton versus Nico Rosberg in the title fight, but Bianchi’s plight and the political nature of the race make that impossible to do as freely as we would wish.

Hamilton, who leads Rosberg by 10 points and led the practice times on Friday, related the trauma of the last few days to his memories of his nine-year-old friend Daniel Spence, saying in his BBC column: ‘Even now, I can remember standing on the bank beside a track with him with our suits on just before a race, all laughing and joking. The next thing I knew I was at his funeral. It was the first time I’d been to one.

‘It is very hard to put that out of my mind at the moment, after what happened to Jules. But it does not make me rethink wanting to be a Formula One driver. I love this sport.’

Whiting discussed a number of his ideas with the drivers on Friday and will talk to the teams collectively on Saturday morning. However, no safety improvements will be introduced for this weekend’s race — a vanity project for Putin, who has paid Ecclestone in excess of £100million towards a seven-year contract for the privilege.

The staging of the race scratches an old Soviet itch. Leonid Brezhnev, who drove at hell-raising speeds around Moscow’s quiet night-time streets in his fleet of cars that included his beloved Rolls-Royce Shadow, tried to bring Formula One here. His original idea was a track circling the Kremlin.

More than 30 years later the race has arrived. But should it be going ahead when, among other considerations, flight MH17 came down at a spot in Ukraine only 320 north west of here? It is a moral dilemma with which Formula One has not over-exercised itself.

Then again, the West has not imposed sporting sanctions on Russia, a decision made by the EU rather than BC Ecclestone. Nor have sponsors squealed.

Still, many of us will feel extremely uneasy watching President Putin playing politics in the paddock.
