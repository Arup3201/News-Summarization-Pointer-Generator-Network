Monica Porter caused a stir when she wrote about being '60 and irresistible to men of 20 who want sex with no strings attached'.

Her unashamed account of how she she took 15 lovers, most under 30 and even slept with two men in the same day met with a rather mixed response.

Some said 'good on her!' and others claimed she'd come to regret her exploits and even struggle to find a man who would now want to settle down with her.

But the grandmother has revealed that far from being lonely and rejected, she has since been inundated with offers of dinner and dates from 'eligible, age appropriate' men.

Monica Porter appeared on This morning to talk about sex with younger men and how she's received plenty of other offers since her revelations.

In an interview on This Morning the writer also said the response to her revelations about sex with much younger men has been overwhelmingly positive, with many women of the same age getting in touch to tell her they too have been dating well below their age range.

She told the presenters: 'So many people have been in touch to say they are in support and I have had so many messages from women in my age group who have done the same thing.'

Monica's year of dating came about after she found herself aged 60 and living alone for the first time following a relationship breakdown.

The grandmother now says she's given up online dating with younger men and has had many offers from men who are closer to her age range

The mother of two explained: 'I'd been through two long term relationships that had ended and others in between and you begin to feel, well, maybe the happily ever after isn't for me.

'I was coming up to 60 and going to live on my own for the first time and I thought 'how do you do this single thing?

'I was sad and lonely until friends told me I should internet date and lo and behold.

'The first site was for older people and fairly boring so I went on to a more mainstream site and realised there were a lot of young guys interested, I was staggered.'

Monica Porter chatted on This Morning about the reactions she had to hr stories of dating much younger men

Monica explained that although many online conversations came to nothing, many did involve dates and that younger men told her sleeping with an older women was their fantasy.

Sixty and single: Monica enjoyed her year of 'dating dangerously' but has had enough of online encounters.

'They would say they had always been interested in older women,' she said, adding that she believed internet dating had made it easy for these fantasies to come true.

Though most of Monica's dates were positive, even though she says the first one with a 23-year-old hadÂ  a 'vague Benny Hill sauciness about it' she has admitted that some verged on dangerous, recalling one man who put his hands around her throat during sex.

'Yes there was one edgy experience,' she told the presenters of the ITV show 'there were risks and that was not good, it was uncomfortable.'

When asked if the sex was always safe she admitted 'occasionally it wasn't safe - even at 60 you get carried away at times, I admit that.'

Monica admitted that the modern online dating world can be addictive and that she found herself glued to a dating app on her phone that matched her with singles in her area.

'The app is so easy to get addicted to, it's like you're playing a game.

'I used to sit around reading a book and suddenly I was addicted to a dating app!'

But now she says she has quit online dating, after penning a book about her experiences called Raven: My Year of Dating Dangerously and has revealed she has no shortage of offers despite being so frank about her sex life.

'I've deleted all my online dating accounts now,' she says 'I've got something out of my system - it was just a reaction to my situation and not something you can do for very long, you have to move on.

'There were some people who said "who'd want to be with her now?" but actually I have had lots of lovely messages from age-appropriate men, eligible men, who want to take me out so I don't think I'll have to go on a dating site again.'

In her interview Monica also revealed she hadn't always had safe sex with her dates, but said even 60 years old women can be reckless.
