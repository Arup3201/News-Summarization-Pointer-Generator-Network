From a simple coat of nail polish to incredibly intricate and beautiful works of art, the manicure is fast becoming a fashion statement in its own right, complete withs trends, fads and ever-changing designs.

But if you thought the manicure was a relatively modern phenomenon, a major new book is set to prove you wrong.

Nails: The Story of the Modern Manicure draws on pop culture images to shed light on a strand of fashion history that has its roots in ancient Egypt.

Historic: The roots of the manicure go back more than 3,000 years to Ancient Egypt and queens like Cleopatra

Pride and joy: Elizabeth I was famous for her manicured nails as were members of China's Ming Dynasty

Beloved of royal ladies such as the famously beautiful Nefertiti, the earliest manicures involved rubbing oil and incense into the hands before painting the nails with herbal strengthening potions and colouring them using henna.

The earliest Chinese royals, and the Ming Dynasty that followed, were also fans of painted nails, with a bizarre-sounding mixture of wax, egg whites, gelatin and rubber used to dye the fingertips crimson and black.

Ancient Babylonians living in what is now modern Iraq are also known to have loved and cared for their nails, with the world's oldest manicure set - made from solid gold and dated to 3,200 BC - discovered in the country.

In the UK and elsewhere in Europe, possessing neat, manicured nails became a mark of affluence during the medieval and Tudor periods, while Elizabeth I was widely feted for her beautiful hands.

Bizarre: Some unusual nail care has proved popular in the past, including using gelatin on the nails

Bright spark: Bold hot pink and red were enormously popular in the 1980s and paired with power dressing

But not all parts of the modern 
manicure set are so old: The emery board, now a staple part of the kit, 
wasn't invented until 1830 when an American doctor named Sits created 
the first one.

The cheap and
 cheerful nail care system he later devised quickly spread around the 
world, forming the basis for the elaborate looks that make up much of 
author Suzanne E. Shapiro's tome.

Shapiro, a researcher at The 
Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, charts the manicure's progress from basic grooming to serious style statement, taking in fabulous photos by 20th Century greats Helmut Newton, Nikolas Muray and Richard Avedon in the process.

It concludes with a look at modern nail trends and their exponents, whether trendy WAH Nails in London which promises to 'turn fashion trends into fingernail art' or the nail expos in Tokyo where people enter their own wacky designs into competitions.

But its not all crazy nail art. As Shapiro points out, each decade of the last century has had its own distinctive nail shapes and designs, with colours and looks sliding in and out of fashion.

The
 French manicure, for example, was very 
fashionable in the 1920 and 1930s, while the arrival of the 
'power-dressing' look for women in the 1980s - think shoulder pads and 
an epic blow-dry - heralded the arrival of strong, deep reds and purples.

While modern manicures aren't quite the luxury item they once were, as Shapiro reveals, they're still one of the most creative parts of the beauty industry. Roll on the next 100 years!

Nails: The Story of the Modern Manicure by Suzanne E. Shapiro, (Â£19.99, Prestel) is released on 24th March and can be pre-ordered on Amazon
