Adam Lallana might have supported Everton as a youngster but the Liverpool midfielder is still getting to grips with life on Merseyside.

The 26-year-old, who was born in St Albans and raised on the south coast, moved to Anfield from Southampton in a £25million deal last summer.

But it appears the England man has not yet adjusted to all aspects of life in Liverpool after struggling with a 'Scouse test' from his new club's media team.

In a sneak peek of the full video, Lallana was asked to give a definition of the Scouse phrase 'lid', which means lad.

The former Bournemouth youngster looked dumbfounded until being given a couple of examples of the word - 'that's sound that, lid' and 'nice one, lid'.

He then quickly worked out the meaning of the word and added it to his growing Scouse vocabulary. Nice one Adam, lid.
