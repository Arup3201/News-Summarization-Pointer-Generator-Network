Being the wife of a jockey can be nerve-racking, as Annabel Waley-Cohen found out at Cheltenham today.

Her face, contorted into a variety of pained expressions, said it all as she watched her husband Sam finish third in the Ryanair Chase at Britain's biggest jump festival.

But as well as being an amateur rider, Sam Waley-Cohen also has a rather fascinating claim to fame: he is believed to be the man who brought his close friends Prince William and Kate Middleton back together after their split in 2007.

It was at a party thrown by Sam at his family’s mansion in Oxfordshire in June of that year that Kate and William were seen chatting - and within a few weeks they were holidaying together on a yacht in the Seychelles.

Speaking to the Mail in 2011, Sam was quick to play down his role as Cupid.

‘People love the idea that somebody put them back together but they put themselves together far more,’ he said at the time.

By coincidence, it was at the Cheltenham Festival, in March 2007, that it first became clear there was any trouble in Kate and William's relationship.

The spark appeared to be gone, whereas just a year earlier they were spotted kissing in public for the first time.

Days later, pictures emerged of William partying in Boujis nightclub with other women.

It was at the Cheltenham Festival, seven years ago (above), that cracks in Kate and William's relationship became apparent

That Easter, Kate gave William an ultimatum - to either commit to their relationship, or it was over.

So it was that the young couple, who had met while studying history together at St Andrews University in 2001, called time on their romance.

Mere months later, Sam threw his party... and the rest is royal history.

The son of leading racehorse owner Sir Robert Waley-Cohen and his wife Felicity, the daughter of Viscount Bearstead, Sam is the product of a privileged background.

However, tragedy struck his family while he was a teenager.

In 1995, his brother Thomas, younger by two years, was diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer.

He died in 2004, just days after his 20th birthday.

For Sam, horse-racing helped him through his grief.

In 2005, he unexpectedly won at the Cheltenham Festival, riding his father’s horse Libertine.

And in 2011, he also won the Cheltenham Gold Cup on another of his father's horses, Long Run.

Fast forward to the present and Waley-Cohen rode Rajdhani Express to third, behind winner and favourite Dynaste and second-placed Hidden Cyclone.
