Apple has scored a significant victory in its copyright battle with Samsung after a German court yesterday barred the Korean firm from selling its flagship Galaxy tablet in most of Europe.

The court order comes a week after Samsung was forced to delay the Australian launch of its latest Galaxy tablet because of a separate lawsuit alleging Samsung infringed on a number of Apple's patents.

Apple has said Samsung's Galaxy line of mobile phones and tablets 'slavishly' copied the iPhone and iPad. It has sued in the U.S., Australia and elsewhere.

Samsung, whose tablets use Google's Android software, has counter-sued Apple.

Lee Seung-Woo,  an analyst at Shinyoung Securities in Seoul, said: 'There's no doubt the court decision will have an adverse effect on Samsung.

'Samsung is clashing with Apple in 
many places, which could result in a temporary fall in sales and 
increase costs related to litigation.'

Apple confirmed that a district court
in the German city of Dusseldorf granted the preliminary injunction 
against the Galaxy Tab 10.1.

Adam Howorth, a spokesman for Apple, said: 'It's
no coincidence that Samsung's latest products look a lot like the 
iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to the user interface 
and even the packaging.

'This kind of blatant copying is wrong, and we need to protect Apple's intellectual property when companies steal our ideas.'

Apple is one participant in a web of litigation among phone makers and software firms over who owns patents used in smartphones, as rivals aggressively rush into the smartphone and tablet market.

Complicating things between Apple and Samsung is the pair's $5billion-plus commercial relationship, which some analysts think might be at risk.

Samsung, for instance, counts Apple as its biggest customer, making chips and other parts central to Apple's mobile devices.   

The well-reviewed Galaxy Tab 10.1 was only recently launched in Europe and is in the early stages of being rolled out. For now, the iPad is the market leader.   

Competing products including Research In Motion's PlayBook and Motorola's Xoom have received lukewarm reviews, while Hewlett Packard's TouchPad is a late entrant in the market, which already has more than 100 devices, mostly running on Android.  

Meanwhile, a U.S. trade agency is also set to review Apple's patent-infringement complaint against Taiwanese phone market HTC Corp.

The ban applies throughout the European Union, except the Netherlands, where a Hague-based court said separate hearings were scheduled for today and tomorrow. Apple would not say why it filed a separate case in the Netherlands.

'It's a strategy Apple has adopted to completely prevent Samsung from putting its tablet into the market place,' said Nathan Mattock, an intellectual property lawyer at Marque Lawyers in Sydney.

Samsung's mobile unit, which includes handsets and tablet PCs, generated 30 per cent of the technology giant's revenue in the second quarter.

The bulk of the rest comes from memory chips and televisions, sectors where Samsung is the global leader.

Samsung, the world's biggest technology company by revenues, said it would challenge the court decision.

In a statement, the firm said: 'The request for an injunction was filed with no notice to Samsung, and the order was issued without any hearing or presentation of evidence from Samsung.'

'I think we will be rigorously defending our position,' said Samsung executive Younghee Lee.

Lee, who was unveiling the Galaxy Tab in India on Wednesday, said Samsung would launch the Tab in Australia in September.

In a statement, Samsung Germany said it would file an objection immediately. 'Samsung will protect its intellectual property in Germany with legal measures. We will also actively continue to defend our rights worldwide.'

Apple's move raises the stakes for 
Google, which has accused its biggest rivals of banding together to 
hamper its increasingly popular Android operating system, after it lost a
bid to buy thousands of patents from bankrupt Nortel.

Without
patents, companies' devices are vulnerable to challenges for royalties 
or, worse, demands from rivals to withdraw the products from the market 
place.

Samsung has been locked in a battle with Apple over smartphone and tablet patents since April.

The Galaxy gadgets are seen as among the biggest challengers to Apple's mobile devices, which have achieved runaway success.

In
Australia, Samsung has agreed to show Apple an Australian version of 
the Galaxy Tab 10.1 one week before its launch there, a Samsung 
spokesman said.
