Bedridden in intensive care just weeks before her GCSE exams, Alicia Stevens's dreams of making it to the end of year school prom seemed impossible.

The teenager had narrowly avoided death twice, having faced life-threatening illnesses.

But the 16-year-old shocked the doctors and nurses caring for her, making a rapid recovery.

And her miraculous turnaround came just in time to allow Alicia to join friends and classmates at the school dance.

Alicia Stevens was in intensive care just weeks before her GCSE exams having spent time in hospital for a burst appendix (pictured left) but she managed to make a rapid recovery to attend her prom (pictured right)

'There were times that I was really scared in hospital and thought I would never make it to prom,' Alicia (far right) said. 'It was a dream come true to go to. I didn't even think about the past few months'

Alicia fought for her life when she was struck down with suspected appendicitis on her 16th birthday (pictured left). She was admitted again (pictured right) when doctors found abscesses on her lungs, liver and kidneys

She danced 
the night away, dressed in a floor length red gown, just eight weeks 
after being in intensive care with pneumonia and abscesses on her 
lungs, liver and kidneys.

Alicia had already fought for her life when she was struck down with suspected appendicitis on her 16th birthday.

Doctors told her she was lucky to be alive when they operated in February and found that her appendix had already burst.

Alicia was hospitalised for nine days, before recovering at her home in Swaythling in Southampton, Hampshire.

And she was back in hospital just a few weeks later when a cyst on her ovary burst.

In May, the teenager was rushed to intensive care once more, after doctors found abscesses on her lungs, liver and kidneys.

Alicia's mother Leeanne Hamerton (pictured) said: 'It was such an emotional day to see her there in her dress, looking so beautiful'

Worryingly for her mother Leeanne 
Hamerton, Alicia was also found to have pneumonia and fought for her 
life while doctors tried to drain the abscesses.

The teenager was weeks away from sitting her GCSE exams and when she woke up in intensive care, her first words were: ‘I’m going to fail my exams.’

With the help of her teacher Wendy Francis, Alicia sat her first exam 24 hours after having her drain removed and recovered in time for her prom.

She now hopes to pass her photography exam to get into Southampton City College.

‘There were times that I was really scared in hospital and thought I would never make it to prom,’ Alicia said.

‘It was a dream come true to go to. It was amazing and I didn’t even think about the past few months, I just danced and had a good laugh with my friends.’

Her mother said: ‘I nearly lost her twice this year and there were times that I really didn’t think I would get to see that day.

‘She had been robbed of her 16th birthday so I wasn’t going to let her miss out on her prom.

‘It was such an emotional day to see her there in her dress, looking so beautiful having seen just how bad she had got.

‘It has been a horrendous year and now we are just hoping that the abscesses don’t return.’
