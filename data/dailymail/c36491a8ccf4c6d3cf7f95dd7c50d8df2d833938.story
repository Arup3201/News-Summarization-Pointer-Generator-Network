Ashley Young has had his 'fare' share of criticism in the past and it appears the Manchester United midfielder was in an unforgiving mood after enjoying a night out with his girlfriend Nicky Pike.

The couple shied away from the cameras after being spotted getting into a taxi after leaving the plush Novikov Bar in Mayfair on Thursday.

The childhood sweethearts, who have two children together, were believed to have left the popular footballers' hotspot at around 11pm and looked less than impressed about being photographed after their evening out.

And the early night was probably attributed to Young's determination to return to the United starting line-up following a hamstring injury.

The 29-year-old hasn't featured in the Premier League for the Red Devils since tearing his hamstring in their New Year's Day 1-1 draw at Stoke City.

Young has since made one substitute appearance for Louis van Gaal's side, in their 3-0 FA Cup fourth round replay win at home to Cambridge United on February 3, but started for the Under 21s in their 2-1 win against Chelsea on Monday night.

Prior to his injury, the England international was in impressive form for United - having made 13 appearances this campaign by the turn of the year.

And Young is keen to continue to improve under Van Gaal - who has deployed the midfielder in an unfamiliar left wing-back role with relative success.

'I like the variation actually. I think there a lot of players who just like to stick to one position, but for me I don't mind as long as I'm in the team,' said Young, who made his 100th Reds appearance in last week's win over Cambridge, in an exclusive interview with the club's official match programme United Review earlier this week.

'I'm pleased with how the season has gone personally. Of course you always have that thing in your head that makes you want to do better.

'I'm my own worst critic – I want to play my best and I always try to do my best. Even when I've played well there is usually something that I think back to that I didn't do right.

'I think this season has so far gone as well as it could have gone for me, bar the injuries. I'm happy about that and hopefully we can continue with good results as a team.'
