All countries which banned their players from having sex at the 2014 World Cup have been eliminated, while those with a more relaxed view on the matter are enjoying better results on the pitch, research has shown.

Germany and Holland bosses allowed wives and girlfriends to stay in team hotels and both have navigated their way safely into the quarter-finals of the tournament.

Meanwhile, France, Brazil and Costa Rica who have more complicated rules regarding sex, but still allow it, also remain active in the competition as do Argentina, Belgium and Colombia whose preference isn't recorded.

Secret of their success: Has Brazil's progress in the World Cup been down to a relaxed attitude to sex?

Keep it simple: Luiz Felipe Scolari is happy as long as his players have non-acrobatic sex

Star man: Neymar's form during the World Cup suggests he has enjoyed Scolari's relaxed attitude

Separated: Edin Dzeko was part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina squad banned from sex during the World Cup

Lonely: Dzeko's girlfriend Amra Silajdzic had to get used to life without him while he was in Brazil

Departure: Bosnia-Herzegovina didn't make it out of their group allowing Dzeko and Silajdzic to rekindle their romance

Talent: Silajdzic is a model and actress

Other sides happy to let their players spend intimate time with loved ones include the United States, Switzerland, Uruguay and Nigeria - all of whom made it into the last 16.

Of the sides that banned sex - Spain, Russia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chile and Mexico - none made it past the last 16.

Bosnia striker Edin Dzeko's failure to light up the World Cup could be attributed to time spent apart from his girlfriend Amra Silajdzic.

Some managers have shown more of an interest than others. Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari hasn't banned it, but will monitor it. He said: 'The players can have normal sex during the World Cup. Usually normal sex is done in balanced way, but there are certain forms, certain ways and others who do acrobatics. We will put limits and survey the players.'

Other coaches, such as Costa Rica's Jorge Luis Pinto, is happy for his players to engage in sexual activity as long as they winning on the pitch. He said: 'I can assure, with no doubts, they will be able to "enjoy themselves" just as soon as they qualify for the next round.'

It was believed for a long time that sex has a detrimental effect on an athlete's performance, distracting them or exhausting them before a big match but more recent research showed that this was not the case with scientists claiming there is no physiological evidence to suggest this.

Unfortunately a relaxed policy to time with loved ones didn't work for England, who failed to climax and left the tournament at the group stage.
