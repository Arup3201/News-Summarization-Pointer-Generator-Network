One young boy got the chance to spend a very special afternoon with a real-life superhero.

Alex Pring, a 7-year-old who was born with a partially developed right arm, received a surprise visit from actor Robert Downey Jr., who showed up as his famed Avengers character Tony Stark.

What's more, the actor also presented Alex with a very special gift - a bionic Iron Man arm.

'Had the absolute privilege of presenting a brand spanking new 3D-printed bionic Iron Man arm to Alex, the most dapper 7-year-old I’ve ever met,' wrote the actor on Facebook.

He also posted a video, in which he comments the young man's bow tie and inquires about his travels. 

He then pulled out two boxes, one with an arm for him and one with an arm for Alex.

Downey Jr. is not the first member of the Avengers to make a young fan's dream come true either, with Chris Evans recently visiting Seattle Children's Hospital dressed as Captain America.

This after he won a Super Bowl bet against Chris Pratt, who had previously traveled to Boston to visit the kids at Christopher's Haven dressed as his Guardians of the Galaxy character Star-Lord.

And while the chances of an actual visit from Downey Jr. and Evansmay be slim, both men can be seen this summer reprising their Marvel roles in Avengers: Age of Ultron.
