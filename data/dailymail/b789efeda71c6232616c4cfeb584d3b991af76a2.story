Jurgen Klinsmann has lavished praise on Nicklas Bendtner after the Denmark striker netted his first international hat-trick in the 3-2 win over USA.

Despite being on the receiving end of the former Arsenal striker's treble, the USA manager paid compliment to the Dane who scored in the 33rd, 84th and 90th minute to help Denmark claim victory in the friendly.

'When you score three goals in a game you deserve all the compliments in the world. Bendtner deserves them,' Klinsmann said.

'Sometimes it goes well and you score and gain confidence, and three goals is the right medicine for Bendtner. I wish him the best in the future.'

Denmark boss Morten Olsen was also quick to acknowledge Bendtner's performance, even claiming the Dane could have grabbed five goals.

'Nicklas might have scored four or five goals. On the other hand, though, we can not demand that he should score all of his chances.

'It is clear to see that the training efforts have been good for Nicklas recently. I have spoken with Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking and he has been very pleased with the effort Nicklas has put in.

'It has been difficult for him to get playing time because his competitor [Wolfsburg team-mate], Bas Dost, has scored every time he has hit the ball. Nicklas has kept his mouth shut and just kept on training.'

Bendtner admitted that the hat-trick was a defining moment in his career.

'Of course it was very special for me to score hat-trick for the national team, and it is something I will never forget,' Bendtner said.

On an evening when Tottenham's Christian Eriksen became the youngest Dane to win 50 international caps, Jozy Altidore, who could only muster a single goal in the English top flight during an 18-month spell at Sunderland, put the USA ahead after 19 minutes in Aarhus.

But the Danes were soon level through Bendtner. Aron Johannsson restored the vicitors' lead before Bendtner scored twice in the final seven minutes to seal his hat-trick and earn victory for Olsen's side.
