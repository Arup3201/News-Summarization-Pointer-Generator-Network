The latest timepiece from watchmaker Tokyoflash Japan comes with a built-in breathalyser and 'sobriety game' to test how drunk you are.

When the wearer blows into a sensor hidden in a side panel of the Kisai Intoxicated watch the screen changes colour depending on the level of alcohol detected - green means you're sober, yellow means you're 'buzzing' or tipsy and red means you're drunk.

The sobriety game also tests your reaction times to a onscreen challenge to see if you're over the limit.

Japanese firm Tokyoflash Japan has designed a digital watch with a built-in breathalyser. The Kisai Intoxicated, pictured, can measure blood alcohol content using a sensor built into the right-hand panel. It also comes with a sobriety game designed to test the wearer's reaction times

The alcohol sensor on the Kisai Intoxicated is built-into the stainless steel frame. A wearer will need to unscrew the cap, pictured, to reveal the sensor and blow into it for five seconds to test their breath

To test your blood alcohol content (BAC), open the sensor cap on the right-hand side of the watch.

Press 
the alcohol button to start the test and blow into it for five seconds.

The display on the right of the screen shows 10 different levels of 
blood alcohol content.

A green display showing 0.00‰ means you're sober.

A yellow display showing between 0.41 and 0.60‰ means you're buzzing.

And a
red display showing 0.61‰ or above means you're drunk.

Readings are based on the blood alcohol content (BAC) detected in the wearer's breath.

To use the sensor, press the alcohol button on the right-hand side of the watch.

An on-screen prompt will tell you when the sensor is ready.

Blow into the sensor below the alcohol button for five seconds and your reading will appear on the digital screen.

When the wearer blows into the alcohol sensor the amount of blood alcohol content (BAC) is measured on a chart, right. The display will then change colour depending on the levels, left. Green is sober, a yellow reading between 0.41 and 0.61‰ is tipsy and red, showing a level higher than 0.61‰, means the wearer is drunk

A green display showing 0.00‰ means the wearer is sober.

A yellow display showing between 0.41 and 0.60‰ means they're 'buzzing'.

And a
red display showing 0.61‰ or above means they're drunk.

The Japanese company is quick to claim the watch is just for fun and is more of a 'party trick' than a scientific test.

To play the sobriety game the wearer must press button B, pictured, to start the test and then press B again to stop the moving onscreen bar as close to the centre as possible. This tests the wearer's reaction times

The built-in sobriety game has a vertical bar that moves from left to right on the display. 

To pass the test, the wearer must stop the bar when it is in the centre of the screen.

The watch is made of stainless steel and weighs around 160g.

It is water resistant and comes with a rechargeable battery. 

In March, a company from San Francisco released the Breathometer - a breathalyser that plugs into a mobile phone to give owners an instant BAC reading.

The gadget pugs into the headset jack of an iPhone or Android handset and its makers say it allows owners to check their alcohol level wherever they and - and claim it could even be used to choose who should drive.

In April, the BACtrack mobile breathalyser app was released that can automatically post BAC levels to Facebook or Twitter.

Critics claimed the mobile breathalyser could encourage drinking games but the firm behind it claims it will help users 'understand how alcohol affects their body'.

Users can even create a drink diary of their evening, with pictures of every drink and how it affected their blood alcohol level and users readings are shown on a 'world drinking map'.
