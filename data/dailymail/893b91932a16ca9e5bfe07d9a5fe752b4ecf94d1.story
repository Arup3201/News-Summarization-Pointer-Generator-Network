Under fire: The Red Tractor, lays down the lowest animal welfare standards of any quality mark

Hundreds of brands in Britain's supermarket carry the Red Tractor food assurance label, but it is now under fire for scoring the lowest animal welfare standards of any quality mark, according to a new report.

The label's animal welfare practices have led the authors of the 60-page report to advise shoppers to look for schemes which scored higher in their treatment of animals.

The damning report into assurance schemes in the UK was carried out by two charities, Compassion in World Farming and OneKind.

The Farm Assurance Scheme and Animal Welfare research, found that the Red Tractor, Britain's biggest food label, officially known as Assured Food Standards, did little more than meet legal requirements.

The two charities behind the report, advised consumers to buy meat carrying the RSPCA or Soil Association logo.

The Assured Food Standards logo guarantees basic British standards, which are higher than imports from some countries with lower welfare legislation.

It achieved a low score in the study for areas including pigs mutilations with the report recommending the 'prohibition of mutilations of pigs, or at least stringent restrictions on mutilations.'

It also stated the label should introduce 'a requirement to use anaesthetic for tail docking and a requirement to use teeth grinding instead of teeth clipping.'

Joyce D’Silva, of Compassion in World Farming said 'All too often the farmers turn to routine tail docking of piglets to avoid tail biting rather than addressing the cause of the problem – lack of enrichment. Routine tail docking is not only painful, it’s illegal.

'Compassion in World Farming urges British pig farmers not only to follow the law, but to go beyond it and provide the best possible conditions for their pigs,' she added.

Criticism: The Red Tractor food label was criticised for allowing pig tail-docking without anaesthetic

Tail
docking is carried out on approximately 80 per cent of piglets in the 
UK to try to reduce the risk of tail biting when they are older.

Tail biting, which may be a symptom of physical or mental stress, is painful and can lead to serious injury.

The law prohibits the routine docking
of piglets’ tails, but it can be carried out provided other measures 
have been taken first to try to reduce tail biting.

These include providing environmental
enrichment material (e.g. straw), providing more space per pig, and 
increasing the amount of feeding space available.

Farmers say docking is necessary to 
prevent infection as a result of bites from fellow animals.

To dock, farmers cut off a portion of the tail with a pair of pliers or a knife, frequently without anaesthetic.

The Red Tractor label which is shown on £12bn worth of food annually, was generally given 'Major improvement needed' in nearly every category.'

It was recommended to improve in 
categories such as providing more space for animals and reducing the 
time the animals spent in transportation and achieved low scores for genetically modified or cloned animals as well as tethering of sheep and cattle.

The report graded the labels according to bronze, silver and gold level ratings.

Bronze meant the label achieved a score of 50 per cent or higher and means it offered  an acceptable standard of welfare, but with many important issues still unresolved.

Silver is achieved if the label manages to obtain 70 per cent or higher and offers a good standard, but still has areas which need improving.

And gold standard is awarded if the label offers a high standard of welfare and achieves 90 per cent or over.

In the summary, the report concluded:

'The Assured Food Standards (AFS) 
schemes generally scored poorly. Free-range standards for broiler 
chickens and turkeys achieved abronze farming system rating but 
neither these standards, nor any of the other AFS schemes, achieved an 
overall scheme rating for anyspecies.

'The AFS standards offer few welfare 
benefits compared with standard industry practice and generally only 
ensure compliance with minimum legislative requirements (the 
interpretation of which is considered inadequate in some cases).'

Other labels tested include Lion 
Mark, RSPCA Freedom and Food Soil Association - the latter scored 
extremely highly and achieved a gold standard.

It
came first place of the schemes analysed across all species. The 
farming system was rated gold for pigs and laying hens and silver for 
all other species.

Overall, the Soil Association scheme was rated silver for all 
species, except sheep, for which it was rated bronze.

The report 
recommended that it improved its score in killing surplus male animals.

Coming in at second place, the RSPCA 
Freedom Food Scheme achieved good scores for all species, and overall 
the scheme was rated bronze.

The RSPCA scheme consistently out-performed
the other schemes in certain areas, but still has recommended points 
for improvement such as adequate outdoor space for animals.

Under scrutiny: The report also tested labels such as (l-r) Lion Mark, RSPCA Freedom and Soil Association - the latter scored extremely highly and achieved a gold standard

The British Lion Quality Code of Practice achieved a silver farming system rating for its free-range laying hen standards but scored very poorly for its minimum standards in areas such as animal housing and transportation duration.  

In response to the research, David Clarke, CEO, Red Tractor Assurance said:

'We believe this a shockingly poor report. It is biased and inaccurate and several statements about Red Tractor are just plain wrong. It is not a report by independent experts it is propaganda from a campaign group.

'The report has created a theoretical ‘ideal standard’ against which it measures the schemes.  Their benchmark is totally unrealistic, in most cases not even the most expensive organic products meet them.  The report has no regard for the cost of production and what shoppers can afford.  It is no more realistic than a motoring report that suggests that everyone should buy a Ferrari,' he added.
