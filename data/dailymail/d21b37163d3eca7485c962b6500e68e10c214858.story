At Tottenham’s training ground, the staff are getting used to Mauricio Pochettino walking around sipping the traditional South American drink mate.

He orders the stuff by the box load, sharing it with his coaching staff in the manager’s office as they swap ideas after training sessions.

It is a reminder of home and yet Pochettino has already settled into life as the the club’s latest new manager. It feels like a good fit.

This, remember, is the most political club in the Barclays Premier League, where everybody wants the ear of chairman Daniel Levy.

In Pochettino they have a manager without any connections, historical or otherwise, to the club, or loyalty to the players and coaching staff. He arrived without prejudice.

The Argentine is a clean break from the club’s past. Glenn Hoddle, Jacques Santini, Martin Jol, Juande Ramos, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood were all championed by the chairman when they were appointed. They all left via the back door.

Harry Redknapp pretty much cracked it with those two, fourth placed finishes, but the club has to move on from those glorious Champions League nights at some point. This is as good a time as any.

Life is good for Pochettino, with two impressive victories in his opening two matches in the Barclays Premier League.

At Upton Park, on the opening day of the season, it was important to break the cycle of three successive defeats - ‘The Treble’ as West Ham fans had come to call it - against Sam Allardyce’s team.

Last Sunday, when they picked off QPR at White Hart Lane, there was a swagger about their football. That’s what Spurs fans are after and that is what they deserve after so much mediocrity.

Pochettino is the man to give it to them after transferring the methods he used so successfully at Southampton to the grander stage at Spurs. More is expected of him now.

Inevitably he has repaired the fractured relationship with Erik Lamela, the Argentinian winger who made just a handful of appearances last season.

After spending £30m to sign him from Roma last summer, it was important to get back onside. Pochettino, who spoke at length with Dani Osvaldo about the winger (he and Lamela played together at Roma), wasted no time.

Lamela, who was 21 when he was signed by Villas-Boas, struggled to settle in London initially. He spent most of last season recovering from a fractured vertebra and vowed to make an impact under Tottenham’s new regime.

Wise words: Pochettino spoke to Dani Osvaldo about Lamela, to try to get the best out of the winger

In the 4-0 destruction of Rangers last Sunday, he showed that he will be able to light up the place with that magic left boot.

He is a shy and introverted boy, but Pochettino is determined to bring the best out of him when he pulls on the Tottenham shirt.

That is the art of management, something Pochettino was noted for during his spell on the south coast at Southampton.

He formed a bond with the best players, sparring with Luke Shaw, captain Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Morgan Schneiderlin when they arrived for training each morning.

Pochettino warmed to Shaw, encouraging the left back when he broke into the Southampton team and telling him that he could go on to be one of the best in the world in his position.

He also has an exceptional coaching team, with goalkeeper coach Toni Jimenez ranked among the best in the world in this highly specialised position. 

Jimenez, a former Atletico Madrid keeper, won gold at the 1992 Olympic Games with Spain. By all accounts, he is the business.

Miguel D’Agostino and Jesus Perez, who also worked with Pochettino at Southampton, are integral members of his coaching unit. He trusts their judgement, using them as assessors in the opening weeks on the training ground as they worked out the best way to play with the team he inherited. 

Pochettino’s training sessions are first class, played at high-tempo and in line with the pressing game that he introduced when he was manager at Southampton. He takes the sessions himself.

It has been a neat and tidy start to life in north London for Pochettino, bring a smile to the face of Levy after yet another traumatic period at the club.

In their sights: Tottenham are determined to sign Morgan Schneiderlin (right) before the transfer deadline

He intends to back the head coach again in the transfer market and the pair are determined to sign Schneiderlin before the deadline on Monday.

Before that they play Liverpool, the team who trampled all over them at White Hart Lane last season. Brendan Rodgers’ side scored five without reply in December last year and Villas-Boas was sacked by Levy the following day.

This time Liverpool feel vulnerable as Rodgers puts together a new team following the departure of Luis Suarez.

Win this one and Pochettino really will be drinking to the future.

Progress gauge: Liverpool lost to Manchester City on Monday but will be a big test for Spurs
