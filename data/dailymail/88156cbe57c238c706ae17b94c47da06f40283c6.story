Murdered: The body of Peter Battle was found in his countryside home. A post mortem has revealed he died as a result of severe head injuries

A man was today being questioned over the murder of an antiques dealer whose body was found at his countryside cottage, possibly weeks after he died.

Police believe businessman Peter Battle's profession may be a significant factor in his suspected murder after a number of high value and suspicious items were stolen after his death.

It is thought Mr Battle, 56, may have lain dead in the lounge of his home in Full Sutton, North Yorkshire, for weeks before his body was found last Thursday. He was last seen alive on Boxing Day.

Humberside Police broke in and made the grim discovery when a friend raised the alarm after not being able to contact the antiques dealer.

A post mortem has since concluded that he died as a result of severe head injuries, possibly caused by a blunt instrument.

A 26-year-old man was arrested in Malton, North Yorkshire, on Monday evening in connection with the murder.

Officers say they have reason to believe items such as silver cutlery, rare coins, sovereign and half-sovereign rings and a black and silver Advent laptop may have been stolen since Mr Battle died, and have launched a huge investigation with more than 100 police officers and staff.

Detective Chief Inspector Alastair McFarlane said there was no sign of a break in at the rural cottage, and police believed someone had visited the property after his death.

He added: 'We also have information suggesting that a person or persons may have been visiting the property in the weeks preceding the discovery of Mr Battle's body.

'Sadly, we think that Mr Battle may have died quite some time prior to our discovering the scene of the murder, and we are keen to have information about any movements at the property from around the end of December 2012 until that time.

'We have a substantial number of officers and staff working on the investigation with forensic examination of the scene continuing and other lines of enquiry being actively pursued.'

Mr Battle regularly attended auction houses in Yorkshire and was a frequent trader on internet auction site eBay. But his last transactions on the site were in mid December.

He was known to deal in silver and gold and particularly half-sovereign and sovereign rings, coins and cutlery.

Mr Battle previously ran a computer repair business and was director for a marketing firm, Barton Trott Battle, based at Clifton Moor, North Yorkshire.

Det Chief Insp McFarlane said police were speaking to auction houses, as well as eBay, to ascertain whether someone had been trying to sell items like those taken from Mr Battle's house.

He said: 'We have a substantial number of officers and staff working on the investigation with forensic examination of the scene continuing and other lines of inquiry being actively pursued.

'This is a serious crime and we are keen to bring the killers of Peter Battle to justice.'

'If you know of anything which may assist us in our inquiries phone Humberside Police on the non-emergency number 101 quoting log number 492 of February 7, or directly to the incident room on 01377 208989. Alternatively, calls can be made anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.'
