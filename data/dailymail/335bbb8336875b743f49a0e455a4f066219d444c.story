'Not a stripper': Camilla Robson's mother said her daughter was a photographer and had 'not done it before'

Wedged between Harry Styles and Nick Grimshaw and posing provocatively with a truncheon complete with skimpy attire, she certainly gives the impression of being a professional stripper. 

But according to the English teacher mother of Camilla Robson nothing could be further from the truth. 

According to Jennifer Robson her daughter’s saucy antics with teenage superstar Harry were nothing but a ‘favour’ for a friend and she now bitterly regrets her decision to take the booking. 

Miss Robson was photographed at the weekend in her black lacy underwear, straddling the One Direction singer. 

Dressed as a sexy policewoman, the 30-year-old graduate performed a 10-minute striptease – with nunchucks in her hand – at his 19th birthday party.

But Miss Robson is now said to be mortified after photographs of the raunchy lap dance emerged on Twitter.

The photographer, who lives with her family in a £1.1million five bedroom townhouse in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, claims she only took the booking as a ‘favour’ for a friend and had never done it before.

Yesterday, Mrs Robson, 61, a retired English teacher, said her daughter now deeply regretted taking her clothes off for the young pin-up.

She said: ‘She’s not a stripper. That’s not her job. She’s a photographer.

‘She has not done it before. She was just doing it as a favour for a friend and now, obviously, she regrets it.

‘She is really embarrassed by the whole thing and she doesn’t want to talk about it. 

‘She is shocked by all the attention it has got. I suppose she should have known it would really.’ 

However
Miss Robson, known as Millie, is no stranger to erotic performances, as
it has emerged her photography business focuses on pole dancing.

Miss Robson, known as Millie, performed a striptease for Styles and 40 friends, including socialite Pixie Geldof, at a trendy east London restaurant, on Friday night.

The £100 lap dance was reportedly paid for by Styles’s friend, Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw, 28, who was pictured laughing hysterically during the risqué routine.

Styles, who previously dated television presenter Caroline Flack, 33, and US country singer Taylor Swift, 23, said afterwards: ‘She stripped down to her underwear, but unfortunately there was a no-nudity policy in the bar.

‘Then a guy I our group came up and said ‘I went to college with her’.’

Miss Robson is not a conventional photographer and specialises in pole dancing, a skill that she also practices herself.

But her friends were nonetheless stunned to see that she had performed a lap dance at the celebrity party.

Friend Hayley Rowe wrote on Facebook: ‘Ah oh my god. This is amazing Mills. Is he even old enough??,’ while Kira Alice Palmer simply exclaimed: ‘Millie!’.

Lucy Sotty wrote: ‘Fame at last’, to which Miss Robson replied: ‘For all of 5 minutes’.

Her brother Tim Robson, 33, posted photographs on Facebook of his sister on the front pages of several tabloid newspapers.

Beneath it, he joked to his mother: ‘We need to talk about Millie.’

Miss Robson went to a comprehensive school in Teddington and studied a Bachelors’ degree in fashion photography at London College of Fashion.

After graduating, she set up Millie 
Robson Photography, focusing on pole dancing, and now charges £450 for 
two-hour photo shoots at her Kingston studio.

Her website says: ‘She has always been interested in anything provocative and erotic, whether it be art or dance.

‘She discovered she had an eye for photography in her late teens so decided to pursue it.

Five minutes of fame: Miss Robson's friends seemed stunned by the striptease revelations. One friend posted on Facebook: 'Fame at last', to which she replied: 'For all of 5 minutes'

‘Throughout university she learnt to pole dance, meeting an array of inspirational dancers which made her realise that this was the root she should follow with her photography.

‘Pole dancers are amazing, they create such beautiful shapes.’

She recently released a 2013 calendar called Magic At Midnight, which features photographs of scantily-clad pole dancers.

Photographs on Facebook also show Miss Robson pole dancing upside down in a black bra and briefs. 

The keen snowboarder and gym-goer teaches classes in ‘movement’, set to 1970s and Motown music, at her local parish hall.

She comes from a creative family and her late father, Dennis Robson, co-founded Pennington Robson Consultancy, an interior architecture and design business in London. He died in 1995, aged 46.

On her Facebook page, the part-time television extra describes actress Billie Piper, who stars in Secret Diary of a Call Girl, as ‘my blond doppelgänger’.

Yesterday, she left her three-storey house on a red bike, dressed in tracksuit bottoms and a gilet.She hid her face beneath a black woollen hat, and declined to comment.
