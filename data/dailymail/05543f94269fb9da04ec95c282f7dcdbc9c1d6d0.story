Stunning shots of these cliff-top cottages in East Sussex show the frightening pace of the coastal erosion now gobbling up Britain's coastline.

A photograph taken just over a century ago shows a terrace of seven houses set well back from the sea with a stretch of land in between.

But pictures from this week show all of the land between the homes and shore has now disappeared into the sea - with just two houses left hanging in the balance.

Before: A photograph of cottages at Birling Gap, East Sussex in 1905 shows the third chimney from the left separated from the sea by four other houses, a garden and large stretch of land

After: But pictures from this week show the property with the same chimney now teetering on the cliff-edge after the sea cut its way through all of the other homes

The properties are at Birling Gap, near Eastbourne, where planners have beat a hasty retreat, demolishing houses before they fall over the cliff.

The houses were built for coastguards ibetween 1800 and 1820 and allowed their occupants an unrivaled view of the English Channel. The photo taken around 1905 shows all seven properties within a large walled garden built with a brick shed on the perimeter.

In that photo, many metres of cliff-top land lies between the garden's walls and the cliff edge, with a beach beyond.

But one hundred years of storms have since battered the coastline, cutting away huge chunks of the cliff-top land. Demolition crews have since removed many of the ex-coastguard homes and destroyed the latest terraced property this week.

Gone: The cottage is not being allowed to fall away naturally because it is attached to other properties and would pose a danger to beach-goers

Demolition: The local council says more than three metres of cliff has been lost in the past four months due to the severe winter weather

Going: Authorities in the area have been fighting a running battle with the sea as they attempt to demolish properties in Birling Gap, East Sussex before they fall over the cliff edge

After some of the cottages had to be demolished in 1994 and more in the early 2000s, a cherry picker was used this week to remove the walls of the latest property, with what is left of the house expected to have disappeared by the end of the week.

Wealden District Council have said that at least three metres of cliff has been lost along the seafront of Birling Gap in the past four months - which represents about seven years' worth of erosion at the usual rate.

Experts say it is not possible to allow the cottage to fall away into the sea naturally because it is attached to other properties and would pose a danger to beach-goers below.

A huge crack in the land has opened just yards from the cottages in recent week and the steps below which lead to the beach have also been closed off following collapses.

Just last week, two sightseers were pictured standing close to the edge of the cliffs causing Eastbourne RNLI spokesman Bob Jeffery to warn people to steer clear of the crumbling chalk.

The National Trust - which is responsible for the stretch of coastline - says winter storms have caused the kind of damage they had not expecting for years to come.

The trust - which owns more than 740 miles of coastline around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, around a tenth of the total coastline for the three countries - has previously warned that with more extreme weather predicted, the rate of change on Britain's coastline will speed up.
