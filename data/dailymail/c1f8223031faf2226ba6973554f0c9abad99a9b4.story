Loic Remy will have a scan on his damaged groin on Wednesday as Chelsea face up to a striker crisis ahead of their clash with Manchester United.

The France forward, who scored Chelsea’s opener in the 13th minute against Maribor in their 6-0 Champions League victory at Stamford Bridge, limped off immediately after his goal.

Blues boss Jose Mourinho, who is already without Diego Costa for Sunday’s trip to Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League, claims Remy has no chance.

Remy's injury could pose a serious problem for Chelsea, who go to Manchester United next week

Didier Drogba, who came on to score his first goal for Chelsea since returning to the club, could start at Old Trafford if both strikers are ruled out.

Mourinho said: ‘Remy has a muscular injury. I don't know the dimension and I'm not worried. When a player is injured, play another one.

‘I don't expect him to play. I don't like to speak about injured players.

‘Tomorrow is our day off and the doctor is forbidden to call me to speak about injuries. I don't want to speak about injuries, Man United. I don't want to know.

Remy stretches for the ball inside the Maribor box, and the striker picked up an injury early on

Didier Drogba scored his first goal for Chelsea since his return to Stamford Bridge from the penalty spot

‘I cannot speak about Man United. I can speak about ourselves. We are playing well, we are getting good results. We don't cry on injuries. It's our philosophy, we don't cry.

‘We just think one injury means an opportunity for somebody else. We cannot hide. In this moment we have some problems with players that are not available to play.

‘We will prepare the game Thursday, Friday, Saturday to try to be at our best possible level against an opponent which we respect very, very much.’

Drogba could make a shock start if Costa and Remy fail to recover in time to face United.

He scored a penalty in the 23rd minute after asking permission from regular taker Eden Hazard for the honour.

Mourinho added: ‘I don’t like it, but if they ask to do it then they have to score.

Kurt Zouma impressed on his Champions League debut in a game where Chelsea were rarely troubled

Mourinho insisted that Zouma is 'ready to play any match' and compared him to France star Raphael Varane

‘I was not expecting Didier to play 75 (minutes). I spoke with him yesterday and we spoke about 30. It was circumstances. He had to go on.

‘He was comfortable to play 75 minutes. It was very, very important for Didier. The best thing for a player to improve his condition is to play.

‘His last goal for Chelsea was the most important goal in the history of the club.’

Mourinho also had kind words for central defender Kurt Zouma, and claims the youngster is ready to challenge for a first team place after making his Champions League bow on Tuesday.

Zouma, who started his first Chelsea game in the Capital One Cup tie against Bolton, played the 6-0 win over Maribor in place of Gary Chaill.

Mourinho said: ‘It's always better to play them when the situation is good. Zouma is in a different dimension.

‘Zouma is ready to play any match, but because I wanted to give stability to the team I played since day one with Cahill and John.

‘It is a similar situation to the one I had at Real Madrid with Raphael Varane.’

Jose Mourinho had the opportunity to introduce some of his younger squad players, including Nathan Ake

He also backed Nathan Ake, who came on as a substitute last night, and Dominic Solanke to become first team regulars at Chelsea.

Mourinho added: ‘Ake's a different level, but is in the level of the almost there.

‘Solanke is in the phase of the talent that we know that is there, but is far from being there. For him it was also a perfect situation.

‘Something he never forgets and for sure he's going to play many, many Champions League matches, because he'll be a very good player.’
