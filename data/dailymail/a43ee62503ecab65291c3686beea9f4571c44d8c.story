He tried to enjoy it all, he really did. Jonny Wilkinson was a picture of serene fulfilment as he raised the Heineken Cup alongside his jubilant Toulon team-mates, but the personal acclaim still jarred.

As the iconic Toulon No 10 was buried under an avalanche of goodwill and adulation, he struggled - as ever - to cope with all the individual recognition. Not only that, but the 34-year-old could not just relax and savour his triumph because he had already started fretting over the next challenge.

That will be the last challenge of his career - the French Top 14 final in Paris on Saturday. Only once that is over can Wilkinson finally try to turn off the tap of obsessive, competitive intensity. Until then, tributes will just bounce off his  protective super-hero’s shield.

Hero: Wilkinson lifted the trophy, but, as ever, praised the players around him for the success

In the closing stages of this European showpiece, the Millennium Stadium staged an epic love-in in Wilkinson’s name. Banners around the stadium hailed ‘Sir Jonny’ and even nominated him as a potential president of France.

His last goal-kicks in this country, complete with familiar crouch and clasped hands, brought flashes from thousands of camera-phones.

His words of praise for his team’s collective effort after the final whistle were drowned out by chants of ‘Jonny, Jonny’. As ever, Wilkinson found the hero-worship distinctly uncomfortable.

Scorer: The former England fly-half kicked 13 points as Toulon comfortably saw off Saracens

‘I make no secret of the fact that I have been over-supported,’ said Wilkinson.

‘I have been given way too much respect. I am a bit of a fraud in that respect.

'I am lucky enough to be around great individuals and great teams. These are the guys who make the difference, yet it is not they who get cheered at the end like I did.

‘It has been amazing. There are too many people who have given too much to me in my life. If I thought about it, emotionally it would be too difficult to take.

'Just add to that list today, guys being so generous and kind to me. When guys go out of the way to cheer for you it’s humbling.’

For Wilkinson, the climax of this final soon gave way to thoughts about the next one - against Castres at the Stade de France five days from now.

Even during the lap of honour, Wilkinson was wrestling with the nagging dread that another all-consuming ordeal lay ahead. After that, he must come to terms with an end to the draining weekly ritual.

Fraud: Wilkinson claims he has always been over-supported and sees himself as a fraud

Having joked that the world of celebrity reality TV was not for him, England’s World Cup-winning  fly-half said: ‘I’d like to take a little time out to realise where I am. Maybe I’ll have the opportunity just to relax a little and say, “Look, it’s not do-or-die from now on”.

‘I’ve lived for 17 years where every weekend of your life hangs in the balance.It might be nice that that’s no longer the case.

'Maybe I can wake up on Saturday mornings and not have that horrible feeling in your stomach and not have to worry about all the what-ifs.’

Solid: Wilkinson's brilliance throughout his career came not just from the tee, but also from his rock-solid tackling

Wilkinson gave the crowd what they craved with 13 points courtesy of two penalties, a drop goal and two touchline conversions, after tries by Matt Giteau and Juan Smith.

In reality, those two, along with Steffon Armitage, had a greater impact on the result than Wilkinson did.

Saracens were pounded into submission and all attempts to match the brute force of their opponents foundered on the breakdown-spoiling work of Toulon No 8 Armitage.

His man-of-the-match exploits once again revived the debate about England’s policy to ignore him as an overseas exile.

Delight: Juan Smith, who scored Toulon's second try, was instrumental in their win

Bryan Habana argued that his team-mate’s continuing Test omission was a major mistake: ‘I think (England coach) Stuart Lancaster and the selectors are ruing their decision not to pick overseas-based players. He has really been phenomenal for us.

‘He gets vital turnovers. We also scored a try with his hands involved. People look at his body shape and his height and write him off at their own peril. He has been absolutely wonderful.

'After the season he has had, Steffon probably deserves to be playing international rugby.’

'There were tributes, too, from Saracens. Brad Barritt said: ‘He was an absolute menace. So many times we were on the front foot and he somehow got his good frame into a good shape to steal the ball.’

Call-up: Armitage powers through a tackle in a performance that Habana says should earn him an England call

Billy Vunipola added: ‘He deserved to be man of the match. We could have done better to stop him but fair play to him.’

Fair play to him, to Wilkinson and to Toulon. What they did was not pretty but it was mighty effective in ensuring they retained their title.

One more almighty effort and they can cap their playmaker’s glittering career with a glorious Double.

On the way: Matt Giteau scored the first try after a brilliant switch pass by Jonny Wilkinson

As for Saracens, they will go to Twickenham for Saturday’s Aviva Premiership final in ‘wounded-beasts’ mode to face a Northampton team on a roll after their Amlin Challenge Cup success.

They want something to show for an impressive campaign.

‘We will take a day or two to digest this defeat and hurt from it, then we will prepare to fight,’ said  Barritt. ‘We are desperate to finish the season with a trophy.’
