The father of Kayla Mueller, the American woman killed after spending months in captivity under Islamic State militants, says the U.S. government 'put policy in front of' American lives.

'We understand the policy about not paying ransom but on the other hand... we tried and we asked. But they put policy in front of American citizens' lives,' Carl Mueller told NBC's Today show in an interview that will air Monday.

Carl Mueller said he is sure the government will work on somehow changing policy.

Carl and Marsha Mueller and their son Eric spoke to Today's Savannah Guthrie about losing Kayla, 26, the U.S. aid worker who was killed earlier this month while in captivity in Syria, held by ISIS

Kayla Mueller, 26, was an aid worker who grew up in Prescott, Arizona. She was taken hostage in 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria

'Any parents out there would understand that you would want anything and everything done to bring your child home,' he said.

In the interview with Today host Savannah Guthrie, Mueller's mother, Marsha, agreed with her husband. She said she believes the U.S. government hoped to do everything possible to get her daughter back.

'I think they wanted to but I think again it's the policy, and I don't think anyone had any idea how this group would be as powerful as they were,' Marsha Mueller said.

Mueller's brother, Eric Mueller, also spoke with Guthrie. 

In a letter sent to her family last spring, Mueller wrote:'I DO NOT want the negotiations for my release to be your duty, if there is any other option take it, even if it takes more time,' according to Today.

Mueller's death was confirmed February 10 by her family and U.S. officials. The Islamic State group claimed she died in a Jordanian airstrike, but U.S. officials have not confirmed that. The Pentagon said it didn't know how she was killed.

The 26-year-old international aid worker, who grew up in Prescott, Arizona, was taken in August 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria.

She has been honored in the past week with memorials in her hometown and her alma mater in Flagstaff, Northern Arizona University.

A vigil was held on Tuesday in a plaza of a central Arizona courthouse, when hundreds gathered to hear Eric Mueller offer a heart-wrenching tribute to his sister.

Before the crowd, her brother offered a poignant message to his sister when he told her: 'You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world.'

Mueller encouraged those in attendance to live as his best friend and sister had, by reaching out to others who were suffering.

In the first public comments he has made since her death, he said: 'Only now will you be able to see how much you truly did for this world by looking down on it. You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world,' USA Today reported.

He went on to implore the crowd to help those who are struggling - a belief his sister had dedicated her life to.

Eric Mueller told the crowd to reach out to those who were suffering, and included a poem about his late sister in his speech

'If you see someone struggling, see somebody upset, go give them a hug. It will make the community stronger. That's all it's going to do,' he said.

His father, Carl Mueller, stood up immediately after his son finished speaking and hugged him tightly at the bottom of the stage.

Friends, family and strangers wore pink ribbons on their shirts as they listened to speakers reflect on her life and work.

Strangers and friends dropped off cards and wrote messages for a scrapbook, calling her an angel and saying she represented the best of humanity.

Miss Mueller's friends set up tables to accept canned goods and money for the needy, saying that was what she would have wanted.
