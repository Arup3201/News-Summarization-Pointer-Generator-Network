Holiday makers wanting to get away from the pressures – and privileges – of modern life might consider staying at this forest hut hotel in Sweden.

Visitors to the Kolarbyn Eco-Lodge, in Skinnskatteberg, near Stockholm, Sweden, have to chop their own wood, fetch water and even wash dirty dishes in a nearby spring.

But although the idea of living like Robin Hood's men in Sherwood Forest might sound appealing, with no electricity or showers, the trip could prove a challenge.

Holiday makers wishing to escape the pressures - and privileges - of modern life might consider staying at this forest hut hotel in Sweden

Warm? Guests can stay in one of the 12 huts throughout the year, even when snow begins to fall in the forest, which is two hours away from Stockholm

With two bunks in each, complete with sheepskins and sleeping bags for guests to sleep in, each hut has a wood stove that uses wood chopped by the guests

The hotel is a collection of twelve charcoal-burner huts located in the middle of a forest.

With
 two bunks in each, complete with sheepskins and sleeping bags for 
guests to sleep in, each hut also has a wood stove that uses wood 
chopped by the guests themselves.

The
 environmentally friendly hotel huts are all built from wood and mud, 
and guests cook food themselves directly over an outside fire.

Food
 items including spaghetti, tomato-sauce, bread, fruits and eggs can be 
found in the hotel’s storage hut and outdoor cooking equipment is 
provided.

Those in need of a
 visit to the toilet are either encouraged to go behind a tree, or visit
 one of two sheds, where the loos flush with soil.

Guests at the hotel are largely left to fend for themselves. Although only for a short time, the lifestyle is reminiscent of the way Robin Hood's men (pictured in a BBC series) survived

Originally
 built as a place for charcoal burning more than 400 years ago, the 
Kolarbyn Eco-Lodge has now become a hotel to escape technology and modern life.

‘Here,
 forest workers built small rustic huts to sleep in during their winter 
work with logging and burning charcoal for iron production,’ said 
Andreas Ahlsen, the owner and guide of the Eco-Lodge Andreas Ahlsen.

‘Some creative people in the town wanted to keep the charcoal making tradition alive in the area.

‘They decided to re-create charcoal huts and have this place in the woods for people to enjoy.’

Set in a beautiful forest, guests are required to fetch their own water during their stay at the Kolarbyn Eco-Lodge

Although the hotel does provide basic food resources, guests need to gather their own wood and light fires to cook it and keep warm

Mr Ahlsen said: ‘People visit Kolarbyn lodges because they want to experience the nature and to test sleeping in the historical charcoal huts.

‘They want to come away from the normal day life.

‘The huts themselves are relatively small; as if they are too big it will destroy the nature experience.’

An all-inclusive deal for three nights at the hotel costs 4,390 Swedish krona (around £400). This deal includes meals and two wildlife tours to see animals such as moose and beavers.

In addition to wildlife watching, visitors can also make the most of a nearby spring for swimming.

The hotel is just two hours’ drive from Stockholm and can also be reached by public transport.
