It started off as in informal race between 51 locals in 1969 to mark the end of the sailing season for another year.

But 45 years on the Barcolana regatta now attracts 2,000 boats from all across the globe, transforming the coastline with a bevy of boats.

The week-long celebration of sailing was capped off today with the Barcolana International Sailing Race, with hundreds of yachts taking part.

The 45th annual Barcolana Regatta capped off a week of sailing celebrations in the Gulf of Trieste today as thousands of boats took part

The regatta began as a race between 51 locals but is now the biggest event of its kind in the Mediterranean and one of the busiest in the world

Classic yachts are in full display during the week-long event as well as smaller vessels designed for youngsters aged between 15 and 18

Hundreds of thousands of people spent the week at Trieste's biggest annual event, enjoying classic boat races, land events and night-time sailing.

The gathering is the biggest of its kind anywhere in the Mediterranean and turns the Gulf of Trieste into the unofficial sailing capital of Europe for seven days.

The start line is traditionally 
underneath the Victory Lighthouse, built in 1927 to light the Gulf and 
serve as a monument to those killed in World War One.

Aided by stronger winds this year than last the boats, captained by holiday sailors and world-class helmsmen alike, took off across the Gulf

The race heads around four buoys, one of which is traditionally dropped into the waters of Slovenia, covering about 16 nautical miles

Last year's race was a slow-motion 
affair as low winds meant boats struggled to reach top speeds, though 
the wind picked up this time around.

In the classic yacht class over 30 vintage boats animated the Gulf, racing along on a strong south-easterly wind. Leone Sirio's "Lucia"  and "Marilu", belonging to Vincenzo Ciumbo, received the Best Restoration trophy and the Spirit of Tradition trophy.

A very light breeze accompanied the Barcolana by Night Jotun Cup. First to the finish line was Goofy being sailed by Marco and Pietro Perelli, but they were disqualified for an early start.

The annual Barcolana regatta, near northern Italy, is one of the largest sailing races in the world and caps off a week of celebrations which include land events

Watched from land, sea and air the race attracted over 100,000 people this year alone and is getting bigger every time

The race passes Miramare castle, built in 1860 by Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Hapsburg as a residence for himself and his wife, Charlotte of Belgium

You have to be brave to risk damaging your boat in the crowded race that attracts thousands of boats to its week of events

That handed a first-time victory to Marco Perosa and his boat ReNero ahead of two of his historical rivals.

Everyone from brave amateurs all the way up to world-class helmsmen can take part in the race which is always held on the second Sunday of October.

Offering something for everyone the event includes a King of the Wind event in which people with disabilities race in specially adapted boats.
