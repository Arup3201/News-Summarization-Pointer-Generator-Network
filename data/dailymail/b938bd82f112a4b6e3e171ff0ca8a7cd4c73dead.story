A landslide has caused a freight train to derail, blocking the West Highland railway line, following fierce storms and torrential rain.

The 24-wagon train came off the tracks between Corrour and Tulloch just after 7pm yesterday.

A spokeswoman for British Transport Police said the driver, who was winched to safety and taken to hospital, was badly shaken by the incident but was not injured. No one else was hurt.

Rail services in Scotland have been disrupted after a freight train derailed in the West Highlands last night following a landslide

The driver, who was shaken up but not hurt, had to be winched to safety before being taken to hospital after the incident between Tulloch and Currour

ScotRail's Caledonian sleeper service from Fort William to London Euston, which was due to run overnight, has been cancelled.

The service will remain at Fort William to provide accommodation for passengers. Trains between Crianlarich and Mallaig are also suspended.

Network Rail said the remote location would make it difficult to recover the derailed train and it is not known when services will resume.

Rail services have also been affected on both of the main lines in and out of Scotland because of the weather.

East
Coast Trains said it had cancelled all services between Newcastle and 
Edinburgh following floods in Cumbria and near Newcastle and a 
landslip near Berwick-upon-Tweed.

The West Coast line was also badly hit
by the storms.

The Scottish Environment Protection 
Agency (Sepa) issued a flood warning for Glen Lyon in Tayside, and many 
other parts of the country were on flood alert.

Fire crews were called to assist with flooding in Fort Augustus yesterday evening.

A
spokeswoman for Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service said 
there was about a foot of water on the A82, outside Scots Kitchen 
restaurant close to the Caledonian Canal.

An East 
Coast spokesman said there would be no replacement bus services or 
alternative transport arrangements between Scotland and England, adding:
'Network Rail is working hard to fix the line quickly following various
problems caused by the severe weather experienced yesterday.

'The line 
is unlikely to re-open until tomorrow morning. Tickets valid today and 
yesterday will be valid on Saturday.'

Before
the line was closed, passengers travelling between England and Scotland
endured nightmare rail journeys after severe weather and an engine fire
caused major disruption.

Some endured a 15-hour journey 
between London and Glasgow after their train was stranded following a 
landslide in the Lake District.

Susie Fraser, from Glasgow, told BBC Scotland she was stuck on a train for three hours, before abandoning it in Lancaster.

She
said: 'It was total chaos, there were some very upset children on that 
train. It is quite humid, obviously, thereâ€™s lots of thunderstorms, so 
it was very uncomfortable.'

'Gerry
Hassan tweeted: '15.5 hrs from London to Glasgow, flooding, landslides 
& fire. When we had to climb out of the train and leave all our bags
(which we got back) I thought I have seen this disaster movie.'

Meanwhile,
hundreds of passengers endured an 11-hour journey from Birmingham to 
Glasgow after a fire in the engine of their train forced an evacuation.

The 5.20pm Birmingham to Glasgow 
service, operated by Virgin Trains, had to stop near Moffat, in Dumfries
and Galloway, at about 10.20pm yesterday.

The fire was isolated to the front of
the train, and the passengers, around 500, were moved to the rear 
before an emergency evacuation took place.
