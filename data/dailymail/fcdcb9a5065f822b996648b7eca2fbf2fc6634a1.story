It is a single moment of horrifying barbarism that provides a fleeting insight into the unimaginable hatred fuelling the war in Syria.

A young Syrian rebel fighter barbecues the severed and blood-spattered head of a government soldier, lifting it triumphantly by the forelock as he poses for a picture.

If this were not so stomach-churningly gruesome it would surely become one of the most enduring images of a conflict where the rules of war no longer apply and horror reigns... if it is indeed real.

Unprintable: A young Syrian rebel fighter barbecues the severed and blood-spattered head of a government soldier, lifting it by the forelock triumphantly as he poses for a picture

Blood can be seen dripping from the head through the grill onto the smouldering cinders of the barbecue. While bloated and blood-stained, the face is relatively unmarked, its features, including a well-trimmed moustache, clearly recognisable.

The image - which is too graphic to publish in its original form - was posted on a pro-government website hosted in Lebanon and billed as proof of a war crime.

The boy in the picture is described as a member of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and the head that of an Assad-loyal helicopter pilot downed with his crew by a rebel surface-to-air missile.

There is no way of categorically verifying this image - with modern photographic technology, it could have been doctored as easily as it was apparently taken.

But if it is a fake, it sheds fresh light on a war where the line between truth and propaganda is blurred beyond recognition and the extraordinary lengths to which these enemies will go to undermine the other.

Imminent death: Free Syrian Army militiamen arrest a 'traitor'. Captured enemies of both sides more often than not suffer brutal executions in a war where rules no longer apply

Dr Craig Larkin, a middle east specialist at Kings College London, said - real or not - the picture reveals the sinister and growing role of PR in a war where simple brute force is no longer a ticket to victory.

Where once battlefields were confined to rubble-strewn city streets, war-churned fields and dusty desert plains, they have spread online as both sides vie to control their public image and discredit that of their opposition.

'With the conflict now more or less at stalemate, it is fast becoming a tit-for-tat war of propaganda over who is committing the most barbaric atrocities - both for the benefit of local and international communities.

'The rebels have turned wholeheartedly to Facebook to promote their mission, regularly posting pictures and videos of their fighters having been tortured or killed by Syrian forces.

'At the same time the government wants to justify to the world their line that they are fighting an Islamic terrorist uprising.

'It is an attempt to influence international policy by putting questions in countries like Britain's mind over whether they should be supporting such atrocities.'

The website on which it was originally posted, goes on to list the names of the helicopter crewmen, claiming they were shot down as they travelled from Latakia Airport, on the country's Mediterranean coast, to deliver humanitarian aid supplies to villages inland.

These 'martyrs' allegedly all survived the subsequent crash, in Idlib province, but were rounded up by the FSA's motley desert soldiers and all beheaded with butchers' knives and paraded through the streets on sticks.

A Syrian human rights group says a key military unit loyal to President Bashar Assad is running secret prisons holding hundreds of suspected regime opponents.

The Syria-based Violations Documentation Centre said in a report today that the regime's 4th Division runs detention centres in its bases in and around Damascus.

The division is commanded by Maher Assad, the president's younger brother. It is considered a pillar of loyalist forces and is charged with defending the capital.

The centre has tracked the dead, wounded and missing since the start of the uprising in March 2011. The claims could not be independently verified.

Other rights groups say tens of thousands of opposition members of their families have been detained during the two-year conflict.

According to the Independent, they are named on the site as as General Souhel Akram, parachute Major Youssef Ma’alla, Air Force 
Captain Hussam Asaad, Air Force Captain Ayham Al-Hussain, 1st Lieutenant
 Mohamed Ali Al-Dikar, 1st Lieutenant Maias Ramadan, and Sergeants Sarot
 Ghanija and Mohamed Diben.

It is not clear to which of those men the head in the picture is supposed to belong.

Intriguingly, the website also 
implies that the executioners were Sunni and their victim from the 
Alawite sect of the Shia division of Islam to which President Bashar 
Assad belongs, The Independent reports.

Perhaps this in itself is not so 
surprising, but it goes on to describe the perpetrators of the crime as 
'FSA gangs', while most such atrocities have so far been carried out by 
Islamist militants - not these ragtag - and mostly sectarian - 
militiamen.

'That they call them "gangs" is interesting', said Dr Larkin. 'It is an attempt to show there is no structure to the rebel uprising - that they are just a collection of disparate groups with no real purpose.

'The beheading element also plays into the government's grand discourse by highlighting beheading as a jihadist practice, further discrediting the uprising in the eyes of the West.'

When approached by the Independent, 
Syrian information minister Omran Zoubi said he could not confirm the veracity of the picture.

Meanwhile, it emerged today that 
Islamic militant group Hezbollah is backing mercenaries from neighbouring Lebanon to protect 
Shiites on the Syrian side who claim their homes, villages and families 
have come under attack from Sunni rebels.

Hezbollah chief Sheik Hassan 
Nasrallah, leader of many of Lebanon's Shiites and a staunch ally of 
Syrian President Bashar Assad, has said his group is supporting the 
cadres of fighters who call themselves Popular Committees.

It is confirmation that the powerful Lebanese militant group is playing a growing role in the civil war just across the border.

Syria's regime is dominated by 
minority Alawites — an offshoot of Shiite Islam — while the rebels 
fighting to overthrow Assad are mostly from the Sunni majority. Assad's 
major allies, Hezbollah and Iran, are both Shiite.

The sectarian tensions in the civil war have spilled over to neighboring Lebanon, which has a similar ethnic divide and a long, bitter history of civil war and domination by Syria. Deadly gunbattles have broken out in Lebanon in recent months between supporters of both sides of the Syrian war.

But more broadly, Hezbollah's deepening involvement shows how the Syrian civil war is exacerbating tensions between Shiites and Sunnis around the Middle East.

Syrian rebels accuse Hezbollah of fighting alongside Assad's troops and attacking rebels from inside Lebanese territory.

Camouflaged: Deadly gunbattles have broken out in Lebanon in recent months between supporters of both sides of the Syrian war

In recent months, fighting has raged in and around several towns and villages inhabited by a community of some 15,000 Lebanese Shiites who have lived for decades on the Syrian side of a frontier that is not clearly demarcated in places and not fully controlled by border authorities. They are mostly Lebanese citizens, though some have dual citizenship or are Syrian.

Before Syria's uprising erupted two years ago, tens of thousands of Lebanese lived in Syria.

The Lebanese Shiite enclave on the Syrian side of the border is near the central city of Homs and across from Hermel, a predominantly Shiite region of northeastern Lebanon.

One commander of the Popular Committees said Shiite villages have been repeatedly attacked and some residents have been kidnapped and killed by rebels. He said that prompted local Shiites to take up arms to defend themselves.

'We are in a state of defense. We don't take sides (between rebels and regime forces). We are here to defend our people in the villages,' said the commander, Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of fear for his own security.

'We don't attack any area. We only defend our villages.'
