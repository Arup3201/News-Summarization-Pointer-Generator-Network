Despicable: Ex-Salvation Army director David Rennie, 51, has been charged in the theft of $2million of donated gifts

A Salvation Army director has been charged today over the massive theft of thousands of toys and donations from his own charity's warehouse.

David Rennie, 51, is charged with theft, possession of stolen goods and breach of trust.

He was released on bail and will appear in court on January 4.

The Salvation Army announced the theft last week, saying up to 100,000 items worth$2 million were stolen from their facility in Toronto's North End over the course of two years.

It is believed Rennie was planning to sell the massive haul of stolen items.

Police found 146 wooden platforms 
stacked with toys, baby cribs, strollers and other items in another 
warehouse northwest of Toronto and at a separate cold storage facility.

There was
also crates of food and several bicycles among the items.

Salvation Army spokesman John Murray said Rennie was fired when his involvement in the thefts came to light.

Rennie had been suspended in September after an internal investigation revealed how much had gone missing.

Mr Murray added that the charity will
work to ensure it never happens again and thanked the police for their 
swift response to the crime.

Police chief Tony Riviere said on 
Monday that he expects there to be further arrests in the crime which he
called 'atrocious' to the Toronto Sun.Â 

The police chief said they would work to ensure the stolen items reached those in need in time for Christmas.
