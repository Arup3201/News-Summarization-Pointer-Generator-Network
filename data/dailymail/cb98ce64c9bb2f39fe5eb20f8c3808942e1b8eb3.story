Drama teacher Simon Parsons, 52, (pictured) had a long-term affair with a pupil and even had a child with the girl, but his wife is standing by him

The wife of a teacher who embarked on a five-year affair with a pupil of 17 has vowed to stand by him, insisting: ‘He is not a monster.’

Drama master Simon Parsons, 52, had sex with the girl in school and at his home during the ‘immoral’ relationship – and she later had his baby.

But despite the deceit, his wife of 12 years has pleaded with a judge to show leniency when he is sentenced today. ‘He is a gentle man who made a massive mistake,’ she said in a statement read in court.

Parsons is said to have met the girl when she was 13 and he was teaching at the Castle School in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire.

Their friendship developed over several years and they began a sexual relationship when she was 17, Bristol Crown Court heard.

It continued after she left school and resulted in the birth of a child when she was in her early 20s.

The teacher’s behaviour came to light only after the former pupil, who cannot be named, ended the relationship and her family realised what was happening. The age and gender of her child were not revealed in court.

Parsons is also believed to have a daughter with his wife, who the court heard 'bore' the affair. He returned to the family unit after the girl ended the relationship.

He has admitted five counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. Defending, David Scutt said Parsons and his wife, whose name was not given, had grown closer since the affair ended.

'She knew about it while it was going on and bore it,' Mr Scutt said. 'Since it finished the family unit has got closer and closer.

'His career has gone and that will result in a drastic change of lifestyle for her and for their daughter.

'She says that he has lost his self-esteem and feels constantly humiliated.'

James Ward, prosecuting, told the court: ‘This relationship began in the way that normal relationships do and resulted in the defendant having full sexual intercourse with the complainant. Sexual intercourse took place within the school.’

He added: ‘She acknowledged she did have a crush on the defendant and thought it was maybe her fault that this happened. Eventually she thought to herself, “Well this is a relationship then”.’

At times, he said, the schoolgirl felt ‘grossed out’ by what was happening.

Parsons,  a drama teacher at Castle School, in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, first met the teenager when she was 13 and began a relationship with her at 17

The court heard Parsons would take her out for meals and weekend theatre trips, and they stayed in a hotel. But when she was in her early 20s, the relationship ended and she was interviewed by police. She was said to have been encouraged to speak out by her aunt, as Parsons was still teaching children.

When he was arrested he admitted the improper relationship and having intercourse with the girl, starting when she was 17.

Mr Scutt said: ‘He accepts responsibility for what he has done. He thought it was something that had been wanted and pursued. He thought, wrongly, that it was mutual.’

Mr Scutt said there was no suggestion his client acted inappropriately with other pupils.

He added: ‘[Parsons] was, on any view, a passionate and committed teacher. He created, developed and set up the drama department. That is now over.’  

The teacher is generally remembered fondly by pupils on the RateMyTeachers.com website. But one former charge wrote in December 2007: ‘Well we all know he focused on one student.’

Parsons has admitted five counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust at Bristol Crown Court. He will be sentenced tomorrow

Another comment, from October 2011, described him as ‘one of the few teachers that treated his students as adults’.

Approached yesterday at his converted barn home in Dursley, Gloucestershire, Parsons said it was a ‘very upsetting’ time for him and his family, and that his wife did not wish to comment.

Last week, a judge provoked an outcry when she said RE teacher Stuart Kerner, 44, had been groomed by a 16-year-old pupil before he took her virginity in a store cupboard.

Kerner, who was supported by his wife Katherine, was given an 18-month suspended sentence by Judge Joanna Greenberg QC, who is now being investigated.
