Steps have begun to wipe Rolf Harris from the memory of the Australian town where for decades he has been admired as a god-like figure.

His paintings are to be removed from the school he once attended, his portraits are to be torn from the walls of official buildings and a commemorative plaque in the centre of Perth is to be torn up.

 While officials say the plans to ‘eliminate’ the convicted child predator from the West Australian places where he once enjoyed applause are yet to be officially approved, there is no doubt that they will go ahead.

Eliminating memory: Officials in Perth, Western Australia, are planning to remove a commemorative plaque that was laid by Rolf Harris on a footpath 

A portrait of Harris was removed from a council building in May and now the West Australian Education Department has confirmed that several Harris artworks are to be removed from the walls of Perth Modern School where he was a student from 1943 to 1947.

A spokeswoman said the paintings would be taken down in coming days and would be ‘archived’.

In addition to the school’s action, two local councils are considering what to do with monuments honouring ‘The Boy from Bassendean’.

Lisa Scaffidi, Mayor of the City of Perth, said the council would most likely tear up a footpath plaque commemorating Harris on St Georges Terrace.

‘The general feeling around the place is that we don’t accept those kind of offences,’ she said. ‘It’s a very sad issue and something we need to deal with.’ 

When councillors in Bassendean meet on Thursday they will consider removing Harris’s status as a freeman of the town, as well as voting on whether to rip up a plaque near the entertainer’s former home. 

Removed: Artwork by Harris on display at his school, Perth Modern, will be taken down, officials have said

‘My view, and what I will be urging the council, is to strip him of his Freemanship and also to remove all artworks that the town of Bassendean has displayed,’ said Mayor John Gangell.

He told the PerthNow website: ‘The crimes in which he has been convicted are heinous and cannot be condoned, regardless of who he is or what he is.

‘It’s a sad day, obviously, and there will be a lot of shock in the community. There was always a possibility of this verdict, but nevertheless its a shock to hear the verdict.’ Mr Gangell said Harris had been ‘the hero of the town’, so his conviction came as a shock.

‘Unfortunately, that world stage that he’s put Bassendean on has now come crashing down.’
