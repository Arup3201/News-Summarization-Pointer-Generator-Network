What it may lack in comfort, this motorbike makes up for in style.

Although wooden motorbikes have been created before, it is rare to find one which can be driven along a road.

Hungarian creator Istvan Puskas spent the last two 
years building the-one-of-a-kind motorbike almost entirely out of 
weather-resistant black locust wood.

Labour of love: Istvan Puskas, from Tiszaros, east of Budapest, spent two years building the motorcycle

Ride for all weathers: The-one-of-a-kind chopper almost entirely out of weather-resistant black locust wood

Determined to make the design as authentic to its wooden origins as possible, even for the fuel tank the 52-year-old motorcycle enthusiast used a wooden barrel.

Mr Puskas, a tractor driver and an amateur mechanic, used cow horns as a handlebar and exhaust.

He is used to seeing astounded faces as he drives it along the road in Tiszaors, 161 km (100 miles) east of Budapest.

It is powered by a gasoline engine from an old Fiat, said to be built in Poland.

Talent: Mr Puskas is an agricultural machine expert by trade so creating the motorbike was done in his spare time

Innovative: Even for the fuel tank, he used a wooden barrel, which blends to the overall design

Novelty: He is used to seeing astounded faces as he drives it along the road - it is powered by a gasoline engine from an old Fiat, said to be built in Poland

Pet friendly: Kittens play near the wooden wheel of the motorbike
