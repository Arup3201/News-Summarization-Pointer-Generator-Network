Victim: Father-of-two Peter Jackson has been found dead more than two weeks after he went missing

The body of a golf course worker has been discovered in woodland more than two weeks after he went missing.

Father-of-two Peter Jackson set off for work from his home in Seaham, County Durham, on November 11, but he never arrived.

Police launched a large-scale search and his body has now been discovered in woodland near Haltwhistle, Northumberland, by a dog walker.

Mr Jackson, 38, was reported missing after leaving his home at 8.20am for the Castle Eden Golf Club in Hartlepool, where he worked.

His friends and family told police his disappearance was extremely out of character.

At the time, his wife Alexis pleaded: 'If anyone knows where Peter is please get in touch with the police urgently.

'I
 cannot describe what our family have been going through since Peter 
went missing and we just need to know where Peter is.

'I would also like to appeal directly to Peter to get in touch with us, we are all so worried and just need to know that you are safe.

'He 
loves his boys so much and they are missing his desperately they want to
 know where their daddy is. It is devastating not to be able to give 
them an answer.

'We are just a normal loving family and cannot believe this is happening to us.

'Peter, I love you, the boys love you, your family and friends are desperately worried about you.'

Mr Jackson's vehicle, a grey Ford Focus C max car, was later recovered close to Haltwhistle, 55 miles from his home.

His body was discovered on Sunday.
