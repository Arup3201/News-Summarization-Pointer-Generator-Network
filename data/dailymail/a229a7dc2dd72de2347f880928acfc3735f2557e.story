Two stags rear up on their hind legs and throw punches like a pair of boxers in this extraordinary sequence of pictures.

The stunning images of two deer fighting it out for more than 20 seconds were captured by amateur photographer Dennis Bennett during a stroll through Hampshire's New Forest.

The spontaneous brawl was randomly sparked when one of the stags awoke from a quick nap and stood up.

His opponent was quick to respond. But instead of clashing antlers, this pair opted to throw punches - entertaining the other fallow deer.

One of the stags was ducking and diving to avoid being struck in the play fight, which took place at Bolderwood in the national park.

Mr Bennett, an HGV lorry driver from Holbeach, Lincolnshire, was delighted when he captured this special moment.

Kicking off: The brawl was sparked when one of the herd stood up a little too quickly

The 41-year-old said: 'Whenever I’m in the south visiting family and friends I always go to the New Forest.

'It’s a beautiful place and I happened to be there at the right time to capture this moment.

'I’ve never seen anything like it before in my life. I’m not a professional photographer, taking pictures is just a hobby of mine.

'So I was over the moon when I got home to see these pictures, it made my day.

'I was there for 20 minutes and to be able to capture this on camera was a great feeling - I’m still buzzing about the pictures now.'

Take that! The fight lasted only a few seconds, but it was long enough for Dennis Bennett to capture the drama

Mr Bennett was wandering around the forest when he stopped to take photographs of the deer in the distance.

He added: 'I went for a quick wander around the forest and stopped when I saw 40 deer lying down in an area the size of a football pitch.

'They were just relaxing and then all of a sudden they jumped up to start fighting. It was exciting to watch.

'Every single day in the New Forest is different and it’s great to go there with a camera, I had a great day there.'

Fight! These deer decided clashing horns wasn't enough to settle this score
