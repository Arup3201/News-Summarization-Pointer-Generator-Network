Flight delays to and from UK airports totaled 32 years and 8 months in 2014.

Though an average delay of 40 minutes may not seem incredibly long, it definitely adds up - to the equivalent of the time it would take to make almost 4,000 trips to the moon.

To be considered 'late' by the Civil Aviation Authority, a flight must take off more than 15 minutes after its scheduled departure time.

Flight delays to and from UK airports over the last year have totalled over 32 years or 285,000 hours

Flightcompensation.com, the flight delay compensation specialists, looked at over 1.7 million flights landing and departing at UK airports last year. 

Of these, 432,695 took off more than 15 minutes after their scheduled departure time with delays totalling 17,134,838 minutes.

The time wasted by passengers waiting for these flights is equivalent to almost 12,000 days or 1,700 weeks.

In this time, you could study for 10 Bachelor degrees, cross the Atlantic on the Queen Elizabeth 2 almost 2,400 times or watch the entire five seasons of Breaking Bad (again!) over 6,000 times.

A spokesperson for flightcompensation.com said: 'Flight delays can have considerable knock-on consequences for passengers. 

'We've secured compensation for people who have missed weddings, funerals, operations, and even days of their honeymoon due to late-running planes.

'There's often a financial cost as well as the time cost of being delayed. 

Thankfully, air passengers delayed by more than 3 hours may be entitled to up to €600 in compensation

'We have people come to us time and time again who have been left out of pocket by extra parking charges, paying out for pricey food and drink at the airport and having had to take extra time off work.'

There is some good news, however.

Air passengers delayed by more than three hours may be entitled to up to €600 per person (approx. £470) provided the late-running was not due to 'extraordinary circumstances'.
