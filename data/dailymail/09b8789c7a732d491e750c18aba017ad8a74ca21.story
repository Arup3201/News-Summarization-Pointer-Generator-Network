No-one said overthrowing the capitalist system was going to be easy.

They may have pitched their tents in cities from Philadelphia to Paris - braving pepper-spraying police officers and poor sanitary conditions.

But now the Occupy movement's hardy protesters are putting themselves even further to the test by taking on plummeting temperatures - and the world's rich and famous - by building an igloo camp outside the World Economic Forum.

Activists armed with pick-axes carved up blocks of ice as they prepared to dig in for the annual gathering at the Swiss ski-resort of Davos, which starts tomorrow.

To counter any possible threat, thousands of Swiss soldiers today battled against heavy snowfall to put up 11 miles of security barriers.

Swiss army spokesman Stefan Hofer said it had made construction of the traditional 'ring of steel' an arduous task.

He also revealed that difficult weather conditions could limit the number of helicopter flights the Swiss army can conduct to ferry heads of state and government from Zurich airport to the remote resort.

More than 2,600 decision-makers from 
nearly 100 countries and hundreds of companies will descend on the town - a regular haunt for British Chancellor 
George Osborne and Prince Charles.

But this year they will come 
face-to-face with the gang of angry protesters, who have snubbed the $500-a-night hotels to carve blocks of ice to make igloos to call home in the Swiss 
Alps.

The Occupy protesters are bringing a 
mix of grievances, inspired by protests that started around Wall Street 
last year and spread to cities around the world.

'We'll
 make small actions in the village, we're going to disturb things a 
little bit,' said organiser David Roth, a Swiss leftist politician 
camped out for the week.

One
 of their banners reflected the disillusionment in developed 
democracies: 'If voting could change anything it would be illegal.'

French
 political analyst Dominique Moisi said in reply: 'The reality of Davos 
is that it can achieve things and it does achieve things every year. And
 that is business deals.'

Chief executives from China will garner attention, but Europe will be the damaged star of this year's forum. It is a painful irony for organisers who have worked for years to expand its reach beyond the Europeans and Americans who built its reputation.

 course for Europe's debt crisis in the coming months.

The list of Davos participants is heftier than ever in its four-decade history, with nearly 40 heads of state and 18 of the world's central bankers.

They will be joined by business leaders, scientists, thinkers, pioneers for human rights and others for the invitation-only week of brainstorming that aims to set the global agenda for the year to come.

'It's the perfect barometer of the temperature of the world,' Moisi said.

Four years after the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing financial meltdown, growth remains anaemic in the rich world.

Many in Europe and the U.S. - especially those without work - feel betrayed by solutions that they feel favoured the very bankers and financial players blamed for the crisis. In rich and developing economies, income inequalities are on the rise.

Forum organisers warned earlier this month that financial troubles of the past few years are fuelling resentment that could spark protectionism, nationalism and social unrest.

That is a particularly potent message for three world powers facing elections this year - the U.S., Russia and France - as well as for the Arab world after its string of uprisings. Everyone will be looking for what organisers are calling 'new models.'

The overarching question for many government leaders will be how to restore growth despite rising debts and sinking market confidence.

Business leaders will hold private 
panels on how to employ more young people, restore faith in leadership, 
make cleaner energy more economically appealing, and profit from new 
technology.

Public figures expected include British Prime Minister David Cameron, Israeli President Shimon Peres, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby. The forum will run until Sunday.

The Occupy movement has spread across the globe with Occupy London entering a house in Barbican yesterday. Anti-capitalist protests also caused outrage when they camped outside St Paulâ€™s Cathedral earlier this month.
