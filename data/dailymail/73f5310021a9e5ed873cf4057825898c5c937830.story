Facebook plot: Ceri Shipman, 25, was jailed for two and a half years after creating the false confessions which purported to be from her boyfriend's rape victims

The girlfriend of a rapist who tried to clear his name by framing two of his victims with false Facebook profiles has been jailed.

Ceri Shipman, 25, wrote fake confessions that the sex attacks had been made up in in a desperate attempt to get her partner Jason Savage, 29, out of prison.

One of the bogus messages said: 'Maybe we did lie, but there's nothing you can do about it'.

After police were alerted, the rape victims were arrested and questioned by detectives before police uncovered the sick plot in Hull, East Yorkshire.

Savage, a former boxer, was found guilty of three counts of rape and three counts of causing grievous bodily harm against two of his victims.

He may never be released from prison after receiving a life sentence with a minimum term of nine years in April 2010.

Shipman thought the sentence handed down to her boyfriend was unfair and was convinced the victims were lying, so set her plan in motion, Hull Crown Court heard yesterday.

After Shipman created the false profile for the first victim, Shipman sent a message to herself reading: 'You want to know about
your loser boyfriend yet?'

She replied from her own profile: 'I have nothing to say to you. I added you by accident.'

The 'victim' said: 'Maybe I did make up the rape, but he broke my heart.'

Shipman then remarked: 'It is women like you who need to be locked up.'

After creating the false Facebook confessions, Shipman handed her dossier of 'evidence' over to police who arrested the victims. They were questioned for a total of 13 hours and bailed for four months.

However, police and IT experts were able to trace the location the messages were sent from and discovered that they had all been sent from Shipman's address.

They also found that she was browsing her own Facebook at the same time the fake messages were written, and found pictures of the victims on her computer when it was seized.

After the plot unravelled, Shipman pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.

Both victims of the deceitful plan were present at Hull Crown Court as Judge Mark Bury described the plan as 'despicable'.

'If the victims would have been convicted of lying, then they would have been vilified as young women who cried rape,' Judge Bury said.

Sex attacker: Shipman, 25, made up the fake confessions in an attempt to get her rapist boyfriend Jason Savage, 29, right, released from prison

'You could not believe the sentence that was imposed, you thought it was unfair and you thought the victims had lied.

'It is despicable conduct. You are the only individual that has lied.

'There is no precedent in a case like this, and there's not been a case like this. It gives me no option but to impose an immediate custodial sentence.'

Mark McKone, prosecuting, described how Shipman carefully created the fake Facebook profiles so that they appeared genuine.

'Ceri Shipman set up two false Facebook accounts in the name of two of Savage's victims, and also created fake valid email addresses,' he said.

'She copied the profile pictures and information from their real accounts and set up the fake accounts herself.

'It was found that at the time of when the victims' fake messages were sent, Ceri Shipman was online and browsing her own Facebook account.'

The court heard that Shipman, of Hull, sent the messages between May 13, 2010 and August 3, 2010.

Jailed: Ceri Shipman was given two and a half years behind bars yesterday at Hull Crown Court. There was applause from the public gallery after the judge delivered his sentence

A bogus conversation involving the second â€˜victim' read: 'He got what he deserved.

'Maybe we did lie, but there's nothing you can do about it.'

Shipman's response was: 'See what I mean, you lied and you just admitted it, how can you live with yourself?'

One of the victims was said to be 'in a state' after being arrested by officers, fearing that there may be a retrial or her attacker may be released from prison.

Mitigating, Andrew Fitzpatrick said: 'Nowadays, it's so simple to write a Facebook message and click "Send", but she is fully aware of just how serious this is.'

Admission: Shipman pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice after her plot came unravelled

Guilty: The judge said Ceri Shipman's case was without precedent as he jailed her

Judge Bury jailed Shipman for two-and-a-half years, which drew brief applause from the public gallery.

Senior Crown Prosecutor Michael Waudby said after the case: 'What Ceri Shipman did goes against the heart of the criminal justice system. Dissatisfied with the outcome of a Crown Court trial involving her boyfriend Jason Savage, she tried to change it in a calculating and devious manner.

'She sought to undermine the stories of two of her partner's victims, firstly by creating fictitious Facebook accounts in their names and then recording false conversations on those accounts which implied the women had lied at the trial of Jason Savage. This information was then passed to the police.

'Initially the accounts were so believable that the police had to instigate a criminal investigation against the two victims, which involved their arrest and questioning at a police station. It soon became apparent however that Ms Shipman was involved and an early analysis of her computer revealed criminal behaviour.

'Obtaining the evidence to prove exactly what Ms Shipman had done still proved to be complex and took time as we worked closely with Humberside Police as well as Facebook and MSN in the USA.

'When the evidence was put to Ms Shipman she denied any wrongdoing but eventually had to accept that the case against her was so overwhelming that she was left with no alternative but to plead guilty, and she has now been sentenced by the Crown Court to two and a half years imprisonment.

'It's disturbing to think that anyone could put victims of violent and sexual abuse through further torment but Ceri Shipman decided to take on the criminal justice system.

'She has failed and now, like her partner, finds herself having to serve a prison sentence.'
