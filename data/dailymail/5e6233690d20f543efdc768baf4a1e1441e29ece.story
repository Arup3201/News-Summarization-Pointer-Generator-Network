A song by an Australian comedian which refers to Jesus Christ as a ‘zombie’ and a ‘telepathic vampire’ has been pulled from Jonathan Ross’s Christmas show for fear of upsetting Christians.

Tim Minchin penned the song for his appearance on the chat show, which airs tonight, with lyrics which compare the Virgin Mary to a ’lizard’ and say that Jesus ‘does what Derren Brown does’.

But a furious Minchin claims the song, which draws parallels between Woody Allen and Jesus, had been approved by the programme’s producers and lawyers before ITV’s director of television Peter Fincham ruled it should be cut.

Axed: Tim Minchin performing the song on the show, which was recorded on Tuesday

Minchin - who is behind West End 
hit Matilda - has written an angry blog suggesting Mr Fincham was 
nervous about a backlash.

Mr
Fincham lost his job at the BBC over a programme trailer which 
misleadingly suggested the Queen had stormed out of a photo shoot.

The
comedian complained he had taken on the commission at a particularly 
busy period because of the exposure of such a high-profile show, 
spending three ‘stressed’ days on it.

He said the humorous song was pulled when Mr Fincham watched the show.

However ITV said it had axed the song because ‘editorially’ it had not worked with the rest of the show.

In the performance Minchin sang to the studio audience, and 
guests including Tom Cruise and cast members from Downton Abbey: ‘Jesus 
lives forever, which is pretty odd, but not as odd as his fetish for 
drinking blood.’

He compares the resurrection with the late 70s horror film Dawn of the Dead. He sings: ‘Try that these days you’d be in trouble, geeks would try and smack you with a shovel.’

He lampoons the idea of the virgin birth, singing: ‘Jesus’s mother gave birth to him without having sex with a dude, no she would never be that rude, never even been nude with a dude.’

Disappointed: The comedian claims ITV bosses are pandering to Christians who are 'afraid of anything that challenges their beliefs'

The
performer goes on: ‘Breeding without the opposite gender is, commonly 
known as parthenogenesis, other animals that don’t need males include a 
lot of lizards and various snails.’

In his blog Minchin - who had to rush from filming straight to his own show at London’s Hammersmith Apollo after last week’s recording - said: ‘Peter Fincham demanded that I be cut from the show.’

The song was due to be aired on the show tonight

Ross himself, who famously came under fire for his part in the Andrew Sachs phone message scandal, also expressed disappointment the song had been dropped.

He wrote on Twitter: ‘Really gutted that the brilliant Tim Minchin song has been cut from my show. Decision was out of my hands.’

However an ITV source said the decision was less about religious sensitivity and more that ‘tonally, it wasn’t right for the show’.

Ross had introduced the song by saying Minchin was here to ‘given an alternative view of Christmas’.

During the song Minchin had described Jesus as ‘short, Jewish and quite political’.

In his blog Minchin said Tom Cruise had thought the song was ‘great’ and claimed the producers had edited the show and were happy with it.

The comedian uploaded a recording of the song as performed on Ross's show on YouTube

But he claims ‘someone got nervous’ and sent the tape to ITV’s Mr Fincham.

He claimed the ITV boss was scared of the Right-wing press and of the ‘small minority of Brits who believe they have a right to go through life protected from anything that challenges them in any way.’

An ITV spokesman said: ‘We often make changes to programmes before transmission and on this occasion we felt that the song didn’t quite work editorially.’

Minchin has now posted the pulled footage on his own website to allow fans to hear the track, saying: ‘I hope you enjoy my silly, harmless, accurate song of praise, Woody Allen Jesus.’

The Ross programme is to be screened tonight on ITV1 at 9pm.

Almost seven years ago BBC executives received threats after the broadcast of Jerry Springer: The Opera, which upset some right-wing Christian groups.

The broadcast was said to have generated more than 50,000 complaints.
