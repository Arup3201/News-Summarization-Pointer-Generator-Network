Chelsea won a nine-goal thriller at Goodison Park as Jose Mourinho's side beat Everton 6-4, while Stoke upset Manchester City 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium.

Formation: 4-4-2

GK: Asmir Begovic, Stoke City (vs Manchester City), 7.5

Chris Wheeler at the Etihad Stadium

Begovic made a fine reflex save from a Yaya Toure chance in the second half and was solid throughout his clean sheet performance.

Phil Bardsley is looking to be a terrific signing with another good showing at the Etihad on Saturday.

CB: Gary Cahill, Chelsea (vs Everton), 8

Dominic King at Goodison Park

Will be furious that he has come off the pitch having conceded three goals. Some of his tackling and intercepting was of the highest class and kept Lukaku under lock and key.

CB: Jason Shackell, Burnley (vs Manchester United), 8

Ian Ladyman at Turf Moor

A terrific performance from the Burnley captain. Led by example. Authoritative all afternoon. 

LB: Erik Pieters, Stoke City (vs Manchester City), 7

Erik Pieters' assist for Mame Biram Diouf was the 500th assist by a Dutchman in the Premier League.

RM: Nathan Dyer, Swansea (vs West Brom), 8

Riath Al-Samarrai at the Liberty Stadium

Dyer took just two minutes to give Swansea the lead and scored his second in the 71st minute as he slid a low shot past Ben Foster.

CM: Nemanja Matic, Chelsea (vs Everton), 8.5

Dominic King at Goodison Park

An absolute monster. Gets better every time you see him and by the end of the season he will be saluted as the finest defensive midfielder in the country. Scored the decisive fourth, too.

CM: Morgan Schneiderlin, Southampton (vs West Ham), 8.5

Martha Kelner at St Mary's Stadium

Morgan Schneiderlin could not muster the mental strength to play for Southampton a few weeks ago, such was his desire to leave the club. But he committed himself to the task at hand, scoring twice to secure victory for his team.

LM: Wayne Routledge, Swansea (vs West Brom), 7.5

Riath Al-Samarrai at the Liberty Stadium

Routledge executed a stunning half volley from the edge of the area in the 24th minute.

CF: Diego Costa, Chelsea (vs Everton), 9

Dominic King at Goodison Park

He is a match winner, plain and simple. If he carries on at this rate, he will get close to 30 goals this season. Needs to eliminate the unnecessary squabbling with opponents though.

Star man: Diego Costa earned a rating of 9 for his performance in Chelsea's 6-3 win against Everton

CF: Mame Biram Diouf, Stoke City (vs Manchester City), 8

Chris Wheeler at the Etihad Stadium

When Mame Biram Diouf received the ball midway inside his own half, even he could not have dreamt how it would end. He embarked on a run which ended with the ball flying off his right boot and through the legs of City goalkeeper Joe Hart.
