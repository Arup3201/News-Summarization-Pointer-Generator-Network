Formula One may be a step closer to staging a Grand Prix on the streets of London after Prime Minister David Cameron announced new plans to hold motor races on public roads.

A race on the streets of the capital has been mooted for a number of years with Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone keen to bring a Monaco-style race to the capital.

And today's new regulation, which gives local authorities the power to sign off on major motor races on public roads for the first time, rather than needing specific approval from Parliament., has once more raised the possibility of a London Grand Prix.

'I can announce today that we are going to enable more road races for GB motor sport,' Prime Minister David Cameron said as he official opened Williams' new Â£8million advanced engineering facility at the team's Formula One headquarters in Grove.

'We think this will be really useful to British motor sport: more races, more events, more money coming into the country and more success for this extraordinary industry.'

Next year will see the new FIA Formula E championship race through Battersea Park and London Mayor Boris Johnson is hopeful of bringing F1 to the city, too.

A spokeswoman for Mr Johnson said: 'The Mayor is already backing the FIA Formula E championship race in Battersea Park next year and thinks Formula One itself is a fantastic event that any city would feel privileged to host - he is always interested in projects that attract jobs and bring growth.

'He is positive that London would do a spectacular job of hosting an F1 Grand Prix; but it is impossible to say what the impact might be without detailed planning and research and the question of air quality and noise impact would have to be looked at very carefully.'

But Ecclestone, 83, has warned that a London Grand Prix remains a long shot.

For Ecclestone, whose dream has long been to see F1 careering around London's landmarks, it means one strip of red tape has been removed, with the likelihood legislation will be in force next year.

But the 83-year-old, however, appreciates finding the money for such an event remains one of the many other hurdles that would need to be overcome as the costs would be significant.

'In the past we spoke to the old mayor and all sorts of people,' said Ecclestone.

'It just depends on what we can come up with commercially because how are we going to fund it?

'The news is good, but I don't know whether you'd have street racing because it's not cheap to put on something that's safe. Street racing is expensive.

'But if they ever get it together then we'll see what happens. At least it's a good sign, a step in the right direction.'
