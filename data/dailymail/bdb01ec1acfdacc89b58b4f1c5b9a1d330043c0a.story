Adrian Chiles and ITV's pundits ensured England's Euro 2016 campaign got off to a humorous start when they were soaked by a massive sprinkler.  

The presenter was accompanied on Basel's St Jakob-Park pitch by experts Lee Dixon, Ian Wright and Glenn Hoddle to chat before England's clash with Switzerland. 

And the four of them were drenched minutes before kick-off as Swiss officials sought to give the playing surface a last minute sprucing up.  

Alert: The ITV team realise they are about to be drenched by the errant sprinkler 

But Chiles saw the funny side, joking: 'We're going for a break, we've just sent for a towel!'

It's not the first time bad fortune has befallen Chiles on ITV duty.

Larking about: Lee Dixon, Glenn Hoddle and Chiles see the funny side of their soaking 

He visibly struggled with the heat during England's final World Cup warm-up match with Honduras in June, sweat patches showing on his shirt before the game. 

And last year Chiles apologised after he joked that England's game against Poland at Wembley was 'practically a home game' for the Polish.
