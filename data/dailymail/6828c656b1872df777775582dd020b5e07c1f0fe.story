The new chef on the BBC's flagship programme 'Food and Drink' has ruffled feathers when he admitted to eating a puffin bird on a trip to Iceland.

Tom Kerridge, 41, who landed the job as co-host for Food and Drink on BBC Two this year, revealed how he was 'en route to a puffin lunch'. 

He later said: 'Today I've eaten puffin, guillemot, whale and horse', before adding 'gotta love food experiences'. 

BBC TV chef Tom Kerridge has been criticised for admitting to eating a puffin bird on a trip to Iceland

The puffin is one of the world's favourite birds and campaigners blasted the chef for eating one in Iceland

This year, Mr Kerridge, 41, was promoted to become the new co-host for Food and Drink on BBC Two 

But the TV chef, who began cooking as an 18-year-old commis chef in his native Gloucestershire, was blasted by animal campaigners last night. 

Mimi Bekhechi, of the campaigning group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, told the Sun on Sunday: 'He's showing himself to be colder than the weather in Iceland.' 

On Twitter, Donna Brown wrote: 'Puffins are endangered Tom, poor show mate even for a chef.' 

There are more than 15million puffins worldwide but numbers are declining rapidly. 

In the UK puffins are protected on the amber list of Birds of Conservation Concern. 

Bird charity the RSPB said puffins are 'protected at all times' - which means they are safeguarded by law. 

In a tweet to his 119,000 followers, he listed exotic foods he had eaten saying 'gotta love food experiences'

He was criticised by campaigners and people on Twitter, such as Donna Brown who said it was a 'poor show'

Another, Tracey Brooks, expressed disappointment at his decision to eat the protected bird in the UK

Since starting out as a commis chef, Mr Kerridge quickly climbed up the industry ladder and opened his own gastropub, the Hand and Flowers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, in 2005. 

Within a year it had won a Michelin star, and it was awarded a second in 2012.

In 2013, he presented his own food programme Tom Kerridge's Proper pub food and then in spring 2014, he hosted Spring kitchen with Tom Kerridge, which was aired in a daytime viewing slot on BBC One. This year, he became the new co-host for Food and Drink.

This is not the first time a TV chef has attracted criticism for eating a puffin. 

A total of 42 viewers complained to Ofcom in 2008 when Gordon Ramsay caught and ate a puffin on his Channel 4 show, the F word. 

Ramsay went 'sky fishing' for the puffins using a large net to 'fish' the birds out of the sky

Their necks were broken and they were skinned, with their hearts then taken out to eat. 

Iceland has the world's largest puffin breeding colony. In the country, whale meat is commonly found on menus to the consternation of some tourists. 

It is usually soaked first in milk to extract some of the oil and then served as medallions or streaks. 

Puffin and guillemot - which once saved destitute Icelanders from starvation - are now considered something of a delicacy. A particular favourite is smoked puffin, which is served up with a blueberry sauce.  

A spokesman for Mr Kerridge told the Sun on Sunday: 'Tom would never knowingly eat an endangered species. He is aware that puffin are not endangered in Iceland.'  

MailOnline has contacted the BBC for a contact.
