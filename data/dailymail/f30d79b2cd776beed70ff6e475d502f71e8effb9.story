An Oregon middle school football coach has been fired after he planned an end-of-season team party for his 12-to-14-year-old players at Hooters and vehemently refused to change the location, insisting 'it's not a strip club.'

Coach Randy Burbach, from Corbett Middle School, organized the awards night at Jantzen Beach Hooters in the Portland area, but the choice of location quickly sparked outrage in the community.

The Hooters brand is known for waitresses in skimpy uniforms, and the Facebook page for the Jantzen Beach restaurant is plastered with big-breasted, bikini-clad women.

In a letter to parents Monday, the school district's athletic director, J.P. Soulagnet slammed Burbach's poor judgement and said he tried to get him to move the dinner so 'families could attend and feel comfortable' but he 'was unyielding and emphatically said no.'

As such, he could no longer support the coach.

'As a school district and athletic department, we do not support nor condone the decision to hold an end of season celebration at Hooter's for any of our teams,' Soulagnet wrote in the note.

He said at least one athlete's family has refused to attend the event but the anger in the district was widespread.

'I spoke to many people over the 
weekend regarding the location of the event and time after time they 
looked at me in disbelief,' he said.

'I started the conversation off 
with posing a question. Outside of a bar, tavern, or strip club where 
would be the next worse place in the lines of restaurants to take a 
middle school football team to? Time after time the reply was Hooters.'

Soulagnet said the restaurant 'objectifies women.'

'It is not a restaurant that I would feel good about my wife or daughter working at. I think it sends the wrong message to our young men and that saddens and worries me the most,' he wrote.

However, Burbach defended his decision and said he would not bow to pressure to move the party because he always told his boys to stand up for what they believe in.

He told KGW News he didn't choose Hooters for its sexual overtones and believes it is perfectly appropriate for families, adding that his own children had a positive experience there at age 12.

'I believe this is a fine venue, Burbach told Oregonlive.com. 'It's not a strip club. If you have a dirty mind, you'll find dirt.'

The coach said he will move forward with the party as planned.

'You teach your linemen to play through pressure,' he said, referring to the backlash, 'and that's exactly what's happening to me.'
