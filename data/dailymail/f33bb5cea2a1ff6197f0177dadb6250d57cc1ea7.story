A couple who claim to be the world's first couple to have met online are celebrating 20 years together - after being among the first people to sign up to the first-ever internet dating site.

Bill and Freddi Strauss, from San Fernando Valley, California, met on a primitive Match.com, a few weeks after it was launched in 1995, and married three years later.

And now the loved-up couple are celebrating 20 years of being together. 

Bill and Freddi Strauss are now experts at 'selfies', but when they met, online dating was a new phenomenon and they had to ask friends to help them build an internet profile

Flashback: The couple on their wedding day after first getting together online

‘We're definitely one of the first ever dates and we believe we're the first date that turned into a couple,' said 72-year-old Freddi.

‘When I first told my friends I was using the internet to find a boyfriend they were a bit anxious for me - because the internet itself was very new and online dating was unheard of!

‘But as soon as they met Bill they realised they didn't need to worry about anything.'

Although today's online dating profiles are awash with dozens of perfect selfies, Freddi's profile didn't even have a picture - as she didn't know how to upload one.

'A friend had to help me set up the profile as the internet was very new,' said Freddi, a travel agent.

Many adventures: Bill and Freddi enjoy a meal out, despite their first date in a restaurant not going to plan

The couple quickly fell in love after meeting online

‘I just about managed to get the profile done but a picture was an ask too far!

‘He only had my personality and description to go on when I turned up for our first date.'

After a week of messaging, the pair decided to start chatting on the phone and after another week decided to meet in person.

A retired engineer, Bill said he believed their meeting was fate.

'I didn't know how I was going to get on with online dating - my picture was one of my better ones,' said the 76-year-old.

‘But as soon as I saw the lady walking in front of me I just knew it was Freddie.

‘I guess it was meant to be.’

Bill, determined to impress Freddi, chose a Chinese restaurant close to both of their homes and ordered the most expensive lobster dish on the menu.

However, his idea of a romantic meal didn't go to plan when the bill came to more money than he had with him and Freddi had to chip in five dollars to cover the shortfall. 

'It wasn't an impressive first date at all,' said Freddi, ‘But I wanted to go on a second date to make sure I got my five bucks back!’

Their next date didn't go any better after Freddi's perm went wrong and she tried to cancel their meeting scheduled for that weekend.

When Bill said he didn't care what she looked like and arrived to pick her up anyway, Freddi opened the door with a paper bag complete with holes cut out for her eyes and mouth.

Despite the awkward start, Freddi and Bill soon started seeing each other regularly and after 18 moths, Bill moved into Freddie's home, before they tied the knot 18 months later.

Bill said he feel so luck to have met Freddi

The couple both had children from previous relationships and now dote on the seven grandchildren they share between them.

 'Our wedding was charming,' said Freddi. 'It was in a restaurant and because we're Jewish we had a Huppa and lots of traditional elements.

'God only knows what would have happened if we hadn't had Match.com - I probably would have married someone boring from my Bridge club.

'At the time I just thought maybe it was time for me to get married so I started going out on dates and meeting people.’

The couple now have seven grandchildren between them

'I had been dating guys who were much younger but who acted like granddads so I decided to find someone my own age.

'I didn't really go out to bars and parties so I thought I would try Match.com

"I was ready to give up and then he came along..

'If I was advising women thinking about going online now, I'd have to warn them that there aren't that many great guys like Bill out there!'

Bill added: 'I feel so lucky to have met Freddi. We got onto Match.com just at the right time.

'I know it doesn't work out for everyone, but it was perfect for us.'

A spokesperson for Match.com said: "In Match's 20-year history, we're so happy to have helped couples like Bill and Freddi find a long-lasting, meaningful relationship.

'Best wishes to this fantastic couple!'
