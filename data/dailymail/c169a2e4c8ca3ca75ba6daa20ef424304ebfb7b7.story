Plenty of fruit, lots of exercise, regular hugs and pot of really good moisturiser - these are usually the ingredients needed to help people have decent life innings.

But one great-great-great-grandmother who has just celebrated her 105th birthday says the secret to her longevity has been a love of saucy calendars featuring burly men wearing nothing more than their underpants.

And Daisy Borrill, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, was thrilled when she received her latest 'hunks in trunks' day-planner as a birthday present from her great-great-great niece Elaine Marsden.

Daisy, who had a long carer as a
seamstress and in domestic service in London before she retired, says 
her daily viewing of a half-naked man keeps her feeling young and 
healthy.

She said: 'I have 
always been active and busy - I have tried to live life to the full. I 
like my calendars - the man in this one is nearly nude!

'I
like his little trunks. I have always kept up with the latest fashions,
and as I don't get out much these days, I enjoy reading the fashion 
magazines. I do like flicking through the men's fashion pages too.'

Daisy - who left school over 90 years ago - painted her nails bright 
red before celebrating her birthday with family and friends at the care 
home where she lives.

Family members enjoying the day with her included daughter Pam Palmer, 73, 
granddaughter Sue Hunter, 49, and great-granddaughter Petrina Borrill, 
34.

She also has a great-grandson Luke Wattam, 29, who has a daughter 
Lotte, three.

Daisy was especially pleased with her birthday card from the Queen - a traditional congratulatory card signed by Her Majesty and sent to people reaching 100, 105, and then every year thereafter - and said she is looking forward to receiving many more.

As Daisy sat down at the piano and reminisced about her dancing days, daughter Pam said: 'Mum has always had a musical ear.

'She could go to the cinema and come home and play the music from the movie.

'She always enjoys herself. She is always good fun and lives life to the full.'
