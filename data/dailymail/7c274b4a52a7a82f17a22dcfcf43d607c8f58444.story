Volkswagen today announced production of what they claim is the world's most fuel efficient car - capable of a staggering 313 miles per gallon.

The radical VW XL1 will be powered by a tiny 800cc diesel engine and a separate electric motor and battery pack.

This will give the plug-in hybrid a 0-62mph time of 12.2 seconds and a top speed limited to a modest 99mph.

Volkswagen have so far refused to give any indication on how much the two-seater will cost

But the XL1 is not about sporty performance but environmentally-friendly driving - with Volkswagen claiming it will be capable of a record breaking 313mpg.

This means when driven in a fuel-conserving fashion the lightweight vehicle would cost around £1.40 to travel 62 miles.

It can also cover a distance of up to 31 miles (50km) in all-electric mode where it emits zero carbon dioxide.

Overall emissions are a mere 21g/km - less than a quarter of the amount produced by the ultra-green Toyota Prius.

Despite weighing just 795kg, the XL1 is tough thanks to its carbon fibre.

Volkswagen confirmed it will build an initial 50 models at the company's Osnabrueck factory in Germany alongside its Golf Cabriolet and Porsche Boxster.

However, the firm refused to give any indication on how much the aerodynamic two-seater will cost.

The XL1 will be on show at next month's Geneva Motor Show with the first models produced by the end of 2013.

It will appear alongside McLaren's recently announced supercar, the P1 - a 903bhp beast that goes from 0-62mph in under three seconds -but also boasts environmental credentials.

McLaren say the £800,000 car's carbon dioxide emissions are 'less than 200g/km' - which is better than a 2.4-litre Honda Accord family saloon.

The P1 will make its global debut at next month's Geneva Motor Show, with deliveries of the £800,000-plus car expected by the end of 2013
