Jane Fallon, novelist, producer of the BBC's brilliant This Life and long-term girlfriend of Ricky Gervais, has written a new book, Skeletons. It's funny and clever, a perfectly paced page-turner that delves into family dynamics and manipulation.

We sit in the corner of a London club for tea. She's skinny but not slight, wearing a T-shirt with a faded Batman emblem and a tweedy jacket. She has huge inviting eyes and great skin, and looks nothing like her 53 years.

Because of the complicated people she writes about I was expecting someone more cranky, but she says none of the book is drawn from her personal family experience. 

Being the girlfriend of an international celebrity has kept Jane determined to succeed on her own

Jane was one of five children - did she really not draw on that?

'Everyone has bits of dysfunction in their families, but I actually have a very nice, happy one,' she says. 'I'm slightly obsessed with other people's families. If you delve you always find something. People always say, "My family is so normal", and when you poke into them they never are. I'm interested in the horrible things people do to others.'

I want to know if any of these horrible things have happened to her and Ricky. 'We've been very happy for a long time,' she says. 'We're very lucky.'

They met at University College London in 1982 and knew straight away they were the ones for each other.

'Pretty much, yes,' she says. 'But it's not like we met and said, "Let's settle down and stay together forever." We met when I was in my third year, he was in his second. We're the same age, but he took a year out and I didn't.'

They haven't married. 'It's never been important to either of us. If one of us had wanted to do it, the other one would have said, "Yes".'

Of course, Ricky's career has taken off since The Office in 2001, so I ask if she found it annoying that before her success as a novelist (she was a script editor and producer at the BBC) people thought of her as Ricky's girlfriend.

'I still am thought of as that by most people, just not by people who read novels.' Is that suffocating? 'Not really. I always had my TV career and I always knew I'd do something else. It can be grim but it made me think I need to do my own thing. It's that being-one-of-five thing. Stand up and be counted. It fuels my desire to keep doing something.'

Ricky hasn't read any of her books, she says. In fact, 'he's only read one novel, The Catcher In The Rye. One of his best friends persuaded him if he was only ever going to read one book it should be that one. He read it, he said it was an amazing experience and he could never top it, so he didn't want to read another one.'

Jane was born in Harrow in north-west London but when she was small she moved to Buckinghamshire, where her parents had a newsagent's shop.

'They'd get up at 4.30am, seven days a week. I inherited a real work ethic from them but I left college with no idea what to do. My dad used to cut out newspaper ads and post them to me in the hope I'd get a proper job.

'One of them was for what they used to call a Girl Friday, a runner for a theatrical agency. It was perfect. A tiny place with posters on the walls. Actors, actresses, scripts everywhere. I fell in love with it. When I left I became a freelance script reader and then a script editor for TV, but you just get bored of the process. There's something lovely about writing a book, doing what you want. I love the solitariness of it. It's my natural state of mind.'

Her novels have attracted Hollywood A-listers wanting to option the rights. 'Jennifer Aniston bought an option on the first, Getting Rid Of Matthew. I would have loved her to do it but the option ran out. HBO toyed with the third one, Foursome, for a while. All of them have been through various processes.' She shrugs calmly, and there's a mesmerising stability to her. Who wouldn't be frustrated that Jennifer Aniston nearly filmed your book?

'I'm not good with insecurity. I like things to be open and calm. If not, I'm too much of a worrier.'

In Skeletons the main character, Jen, works on a hotel reception desk, a job that's showy but not very demanding. Jane, however, says she was always ambitious.

'From a young age I wanted to do 
something important. Jen aspires to an ordinary life in family terms, 
and I've never done that. You know how girls play with dolls, saying, "I
 want to get married and have babies"? I was never like that. I've 
always put my lack of wanting children down to the fact I come from a 
big family. I wanted to do something that made me stand out.

'When
 people reach their thirties they think, "Quick, get on with it." It's 
like they're overcome physically with need. Maybe it's a biological 
thing. It just didn't happen to me. I love kids, I have lots of nieces 
and nephews, but I never felt the need to have my own. You shouldn't 
have a child unless you feel you're going to be a good parent.'

Does she have friends whose children 
have gone off to college like Jen's in the book? 'No but I do have 
friends who worry they'll not be involved in their children's lives any 
more. I think if you have no kids you don't have those marked moments 
and the relationship evolves slowly, not with a big event that makes you
 think, "What are we going to do now?" We're used to it being just the 
two of us, so we evolve without realising.'

Jane and Ricky have been together for 32 years after meeting at University in 1982

She and Ricky have a house in London's upmarket Hampstead and an apartment in New York, which they use fitting around his schedules. He's currently working on Night At The Museum 3 so she'll go to accompany him.

'If Ricky's away for months, I go back and forth. We like to be together, otherwise what's the point? You've chosen to be with this person. It's too hard to be apart. We prefer to be together if we can.'

She's already halfway through her next book - about a woman who tries to get her assistant to honey-trap someone she suspects is being un-faithful. I wonder if that's borne out of her insecurity that Ricky's cheating on her?

'No,' she laughs. And we agree that he's the least honey-trappable person on the planet. But she admits, 'I'm not good with insecurity. I like things to be open and calm. If not, I'm too much of a worrier.'

Skeletons is out now, published by Penguin, priced £7.99.
