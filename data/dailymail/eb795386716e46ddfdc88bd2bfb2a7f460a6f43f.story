What a difference a week makes. This England team, through getting selection right, have become a team that anybody involved in sport should look forward to watching.

The Italy game is one England are going to win, but I want to see them set even higher standards than we saw against Wales, based on the quality of player they have.

England’s first game in the World Cup is against Fiji and I want them to use this game today to replicate that fixture, when they’ll need to not only win but win well.

Last year’s RBS 6 Nations Championship came down to points difference and it could be the same this year. But of far more relevance is that, with Australia and Wales in England’s World Cup pool, that group could come down to points difference as well. And I do not think England can win the World Cup unless they win their group because their route to the final will be so much more difficult if they finish runners-up.

I want England to challenge themselves (a) to concede zero points and (b) set themselves a target of scoring a drop goal and three tries in each half.

England should be challenging themselves to push towards 50 points.

Based on what we saw in their opening game against Ireland this is one of the poorest Italian sides I can remember in the Six Nations, which is a great shame for the tournament.

My belief that the next game is all that matters has not changed. But Stuart Lancaster, as head coach, still needs to consider the direction and growth of his team. This is a great way to ensure they are still under pressure.

Ireland turned in an acceptable performance in a wet Rome last weekend. But in front of a Twickenham crowd which will be buzzing after last week’s win, England should demand more.

I will be disappointed if they do not come out with the attitude that they’re going to put Italy to the sword.

I was so impressed by England in Cardiff. It was a landmark win.

The difference the likes of Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph, James Haskell and George Ford have made to the conservative, defensive-minded England we have seen is brilliant.

This is the best England team we have seen since 2003. It does not matter how it happened, it is there now and Lancaster should be roundly applauded.

Saturday’s game, at home, will be a different challenge. People expect England to win convincingly and that brings a different pressure. England need to play with pace and put speed on the ball and challenge themselves to maintain a level of performance all the way through. I expect England to start well but can they finish each half at full tilt?

I remember in 2003 when we played Italy at Twickenham. We ripped them to pieces in the first half and racked up 40 points — but then proceeded to turn in one of the worst second-half performances I can remember on my watch.

We finished the game feeling flat even though we still won easily. It was a huge eye-opener.

Lancaster’s team need to be ruthless today.

I’ve never doubted this group of players and I’m delighted with how the coaching team are growing. This was illustrated by the control England had in the second half in Cardiff, which is so important in Test rugby.

England are overwhelming favourites today but Italy will raise their level of performance and it’s vital England up their level too.

They need to set themselves objectives. Can they concede zero points? Can they score tries from different parts of the pitch?

Lancaster should challenge his starting XV to stay on the field for as long as possible.

Players should be lifted out of their comfort zones. Italy will kick a lot and I would challenge the back three to launch counter-attacks and resist the up and under.

Ben Youngs should avoid the box kick. He and the loose forwards should tap and go from their own half, keeping up the tempo. Joseph will have a day to remember on his Twickenham debut and, if England play at pace with a real determination to score tries, it will be a great day to wear the No 13 jersey.

They showed in Cardiff some potent attacking potential and, though a year ago the coaches would have worried about their defensive frailties, they know now these guys raise their defensive game in the international arena. 

Danny Cipriani can make a huge impact from the bench if he is called upon against the Azzurri 

Ford was terrific against Wales. He didn’t look flustered at all. I’m not even sure he broke sweat.

It was a really telling last kick under pressure, but I’m also really happy they have Danny Cipriani on the bench again because he is a similar player whose mindset is to attack.

Having that affects the rest of the team and Ford has the chance now to cement his place. I’d like to see the coaches stick with this side. I’ve no doubt this week’s training will have been fantastic.

The win will have reinforced the mindset among the coaches that what they are doing is right and the players will be walking taller, feeling arrogance in a positive way.

You can’t understate how important Cardiff was. Now they can look forward to a really good Six Nations and a good World Cup with a battle-hardened group of players and a forward pack that can go head-to-head with any side in the world.

That game will stay with them as a defining game of 2015. They must build on that today. England have a chance of a lifetime coming up. They need to take it.
