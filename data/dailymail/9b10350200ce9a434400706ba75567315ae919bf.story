Karim Benzema looks to have secured at least another season at Real Madrid not least because of his exploits at this World Cup.

France striker Benzema has hit three goals and been credited with two assists enhancing his reputation as a world-class striker.

But for some time the Real Madrid hierarchy have seen him a disposable asset and it was thought he would be put up for offer this summer with the club looking to sign Luis Suarez.

Just to confirm what already know (that Germany are better than England), since the 1966 World Cup win the German's have advanced further than England all ELEVEN subsequent World Cup finals. 

Real though have backed off their pursuit of Suarez with Barcelona now in pole position to sign the disgraced Liverpool striker.

And manager Carlo Ancelotti, who he retained his job by winning the Champions League, has argued the case to keep Benzema with the club's hierarchy.

The player has also benefited from the support of former France World Cup winner Zinedene Zidane, who is being groomed as Real's next boss, having just left his role as Ancelotti's assistant to take charge of Castilla, Real's feeder club. 

Nigeria's Stephen Keshi is the first African manager to lead an African side into the knockout stages of a World Cup.

On the previous nine occasions African sides have gone beyond the group stages they have been managed by overseas bosses.

This is the fourth time Nigeria have made this stage.

As a player Keshi played most of his football in Belgium, was captain of Nigeria in 1994 but was then controversially dropped and last year as Super Eagles manager led them to African Nations Cup success.

The build up to Algeria's clash has been about  avenging the injustice they believed they suffered when Germany knocked them out of the 1982 World Cup.

A low scoring win for Germany over neighbour Austria would see both countries go through at the expense of Algeria.

After an early goal for the Germans, the game was played at walking pace and both sets of players celebrated at the end in what has become known as the Anschluss game.

But it's not the only time there has been some dodgy goings at World Cups not least for Scotland in 1974.

The Scots had beaten a rough and raw Zaire 2-0 and held Brazil 0-0. But inexplicably Zaire then lost 9-0, a record at the finals, to Yugoslavia.

The 'brown envelope' suspicion surrounding that capitulation was heightened given Zaire then only lost 3-0 to Brazil in their final game.

Yugoslavia then had to hold Scotland to a draw, which they did, to qualify thanks to that goal difference stacked up against Zaire whose manager was Blagoje Vidinic and, er, a Yugoslav.  

Greece suffered heartache by going out on penalties to Costa Rica. But their players then displayed great heart and generosity by donating all their World Cup bonuses to fund a new national training centre.

The squad issued a statement saying :'We do not want extra bonus, or money. We only play for Greece and its people.

'All we want is for you to support our effort to find a land and create a sports centre that will house our National team.'

Could Kenneth Omeruo eventually succeed John Terry as the rock of Chelsea's defence? How the 20-year-old copes with the France attack today will be a great test for a player Chelsea signed from Standard Liege two summers ago and spent last year on loan at Middlesbrough.

Nigeria should have progressed to the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup and perhaps gone all the way.

They were leading Italy 1-0 and looking in control but then Italy's enigma of that era Roberto Baggio suddenly showed what he could do.

Italy equalised when Baggio scored from the spot in extra time.

Italy went to lose the final to Brazil in a penalty shoot out in the decisive kick by Baggio known as the Divine Pony Tail which went way over bar.
