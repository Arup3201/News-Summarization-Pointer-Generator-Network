The Church of England has said it would be irresponsible to rush through a law that would allow babies with three parents to be born.

It spoke out as MPs prepare to vote on whether Britain should be the first country in the world to sanction the creation of children that effectively have three parents – two mothers and a father.

The row surrounds a technique designed to prevent devastating diseases caused by faults in mitochondria, the tiny ‘engine rooms’ that power the cells in the body.

Developed by scientists at Newcastle University, it involves swapping a mother-to-be’s diseased mitochondria with healthy ones from an egg donated by another woman.

Supporters say the legislation would allow those living in the shadow of incurable disease the chance of having a healthy child. It is estimated at least 150 babies a year could be born using the technique.

But critics argue that genetically engineering eggs crosses a critical ethical line, and argue that it is impossible to know if the technique is safe.

Now the Church of England has entered the debate. It is particularly concerned that not enough is known about mitochondria’s role in passing on hereditary characteristics.

The Rev Dr Brendan McCarthy, the Anglicans’ national adviser on medical ethics, said: ‘The Church of England accepts in certain circumstances that embryo research is permissible as long as it is undertaken to alleviate human suffering and embryos are treated with respect.

The Rev Dr Brendan McCarthy said: ‘The Archbishops’ Council does not feel there has been sufficient scientific study or informed consultation into the ethics, safety and efficacy of mitochondria transfer'

‘The Archbishops’ Council does not feel there has been sufficient scientific study or informed consultation into the ethics, safety and efficacy of mitochondria transfer.

‘Without a clearer picture of the role mitochondria play in the transfer of hereditary characteristics, the Church does not feel it would be responsible to change the law at this time.’

Flawed mitochondria can cause degenerative genetic diseases which kill in infancy. Women carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be best to remain childless.

Those backing the law change include five Nobel prize winners, who said the decision should be put in the hands of parents. In a letter to The Times, they said: ‘We believe those who know what it is like to care for, and sometimes to lose, an extremely sick child are the best-placed to decide whether this technology is right for them.’

But a recent safety report by the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, urged caution, saying ‘critical’ experiments still needed to be carried out.

Tuesday’s vote in the House of Commons will be followed by one in the House of Lords. If the change is passed, it would not become law until October.
