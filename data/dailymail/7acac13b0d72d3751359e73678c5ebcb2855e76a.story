Our prehistoric ancestors may have had a detailed understanding of plants and their medicinal qualities long before the development of agriculture.

By extracting chemical compounds and microfossils from calcified
dental plaque found on ancient teeth, researchers discovered purple nut sedge - today
regarded as a nuisance weed - would have formed an important part of the prehistoric diet.

They also discovered traces of smoke in the plaque, revealing evidence of early cooking techniques.

Researchers extracted chemical compounds and microfossils from calcified dental plaque found on ancient teeth of a young Sudanese male (pictured). They found evidence that purple nut sedge, considered a nuisance weed today, would have formed an important part of prehistoric diets

Crucially, the research, led by the Universitat Autònoma de
Barcelona and the University of York, suggests prehistoric people living in
Central Sudan may have understood both the nutritional and medicinal qualities
of this, and other plants.

Purple nut sedge is officially known as Cyperus rotundus.

It is found in Africa, southern and central Europe, and southern Asia.

It is used in Chinese medicine, and was also used in ancient Indian treatments for fevers and digestive system disorders.

Hot ashes created by burning the plant can also be used to treat wounds and bruises.

Modern alternative medicine suggests the plant be used to treat nausea, fever and inflammation.

The plant has a bitter taste.

The research was carried out at Al Khiday, a prehistoric
site on the White Nile in Central Sudan.

It revealed that for at least 7,000 years, beginning before
the development of agriculture and continuing after agricultural plants were
also available, the people of Al Khiday ate the plant purple nut sedge.

The plant is a good source of carbohydrates and has many
useful medicinal and aromatic qualities.

Lead author Karen Hardy said: ‘Purple nut sedge is today
considered to be a scourge in tropical and sub-tropical regions and has been
called the world’s most expensive weed due to the difficulties and high costs
of eradication from agricultural areas.

‘By extracting material from samples of ancient dental
calculus we have found that rather than being a nuisance in the past, its value
as a food, and possibly its abundant medicinal qualities were known.

‘More recently, it was also used by the ancient Egyptians as
perfume and as medicine.

‘We also discovered that these people ate several other
plants and we found traces of smoke, evidence for cooking, and for chewing
plant fibres to prepare raw materials.

‘These small biographical details add to the growing
evidence that prehistoric people had a detailed understanding of plants long
before the development of agriculture.’

Al Khiday is a complex of five archaeological sites which
lie 15 miles (25km) south of Omdurman; one of the sites is predominantly a burial ground
of pre-Mesolithic, Neolithic and Later Meroitic age.

As a multi-period cemetery, it gave the researchers a useful
long-term perspective on the material recovered.

It revealed that for at least 7,000 years, beginning before the development of agriculture and continuing after agricultural plants were also available, the people of Al Khiday ate the plant, considered today as a weed

The researchers found ingestion of the purple nut sedge in
both pre-agricultural and agricultural periods.

They suggest that the plant’s ability to inhibit
Streptococcus mutans - a bacterium which contributes to tooth decay, may have
contributed to the unexpectedly low level of cavaties found in the agricultural
population. 

Dr Stephen Buckley, a Research Fellow at the University of
York’s BioArCh research facility, conducted the chemical analyses.

He added: ‘The
evidence for purple nut sedge was very clear in samples from all the time
periods we looked at.

This plant was evidently important to the people of Al
Khiday, even after agricultural plants had been introduced.’ 

The findings are published in the journal PLOS ONE.
