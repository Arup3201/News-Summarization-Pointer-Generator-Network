The 'handmaiden' of a yoga master who horribly abused children was herself beaten by him and forced to drink his urine, an inquiry has been told.

A royal commission into child sexual abuse at Mangrove Yoga Ashram on the NSW Central Coast has heard Shishy, who had legal guardianship of children at the retreat in the 1980s, was completely controlled by the spiritual leader Swami Akhandananda Saraswati.

Former child residents at the ashram have given evidence she slapped them so hard it affected their hearing, eyesight and on one occasion the force slammed their heads against a wall.

Former child residents at the ashram have given evidence she slapped them so hard it affected their hearing, eyesight and on one occasion the force slammed their heads against a wall

On Monday she denied this but admitted she did slap children and brought young girls to the swami for sexual initiation, which she believed was for their 'spiritual growth'.

Shishy was the partner of the Indian leader of the ashram, Swami Akhandananda Saraswati (above)

On her second day in the witness stand Shishy, who was 14 when she met Akhandananda, said she believed the harsh treatment inflicted by the swami was for her own good.

She went to live at the isolated Mangrove ashram with him when she was 18 and 'did what I was told to do'.

'Violent discipline was an acceptable part of ashram discipline meted out by the gurus. It was represented as an "honour" to receive slaps from the teacher/guru,' she said.

Shishy now 57, was at the ashram until 1985 and during that time had two abortions - one self-administered.

She had to drink Akhandananda's urine as part of a traditional contraceptive method, she told the commission.

She also said Akhandananda sexually assaulted her with a double-barrelled shotgun and would punish her by digging out moles with a sharp pen knife.

Two of the moles were quite deep and he would not let her get medical treatment so 'I stitched them myself with thin fishing wire', she told the commission

Akhandananda, who died in 1998, spent time in jail for molesting four girls.

At one stage Shishy had guardianship of about seven children but said the papers were only signed to make sure child endowment payments came to the ashram.

She also alleged the ashram created a directorship to fulfill requirements to become a charitable entity, adding 'there were no meetings or anything like that'.

The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse sitting in Sydney continues.

Shishy was second-in-charge at the Satyananda Yoga Ashram on NSW's Central Coast during the 1970s and 1980s
