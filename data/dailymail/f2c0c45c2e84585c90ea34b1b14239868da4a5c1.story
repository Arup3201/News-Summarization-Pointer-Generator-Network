Pale and greying: James Hewitt, 55, was spotted walking alongside his mother in Devon

He was the dashing Army Major who swept Princess Diana off her feet – before breaking her heart and fleeing to Spain. 

But now her old flame is back in the UK - looking a mere shadow of his former self - and living with his mother. 

Wearing a cardigan, chinos and suede shoes, James Hewitt, 55, was spotted walking alongside his mother in Devon.

The cavalry officer was seen looking pale with a greying, receding hairline and had gained a few extra pounds. 

The Gulf War tank commander had a five-year affair with Diana but broke her heart and then fled to Spain to open a restaurant. 

He moved to Spain after being dubbed ‘The Cad’ for writing a book about their affair and trying to sell Diana’s love letters for £10million.

His restaurant in Marbella folded after four years and last week he was back home in England.

Mr Hewitt is now living in a spare bedroom with his mother Shirley in a £250,000 two-bedroom flat in a former country house near Exeter, Devon.

He has been seen driving a Fiat Punto car - rather than the £60,000 Range Rover he used to drive around Chelsea. He has an Army pension of nearly £500 a month.

Lovers: Diana and Hewitt, who began their affair in 1986, are pictured at a polo match in 1989

In 1995 Diana spoke of how she was in love with Mr Hewitt and ‘adored him’, adding: ‘But I was very let down’.

Their affair began in 1986 when he taught Diana and Prince William and Harry to ride.

Mr Hewitt has since claimed he considered committing suicide following their affair.
