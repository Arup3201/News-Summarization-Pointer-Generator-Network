Gold Coast woman Helena Sidelik is one of the two Australians still missing in the Ukraine

All but two Australian victims killed in the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 have been identified, with hopes of finding them fading after 100 days of searching has passed.

Now, the Dutch-led-multi-nation investigation fear that recovering further evidence is highly unlikely, with only 36 of the 38 Australians  recovered from the crash site in eastern Ukraine.

In July pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine shot down flight MH17, killing 298 passengers on board.

The 56-year-old had been returning home after attending a friend's wedding in Amsterdam when she died on MH17.

'It's now been three months and as time goes by there seems to be more chance that Helena may not be found and she may not get a proper burial and that is very distressing,' her brother Hans Sidelik told Fairfax.

'We know that this is a slow process. All we want is for my sister to be identified and for her to come home.'

In Milan last week, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop insisted for Russian President Vladimir Putin to allow investigators to gain access into the crash site before winter sets in.

Thirty Australians have been brought back home, as 40 Australian Federal Police continue to work with Dutch, Belgian, Malaysian and Ukraine personnel on the investigation, The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

A ceremony has been held for each Australian victim returning from the crash site.

As for the families of the deceased, a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official has been appointed individually to help them with statements to the media and pastoral care.

But Jerry Skinner, an American lawyer and co-associate of Sydney law firm LHD lawyers is now warning the MH17 families on compensation rights and risks.

He explains that when a deal is registered in the European Court of Human Rights by a German academic, in this case Professor Elmar Giemulla, their rights to adequate compensation may be withheld.

'A lot of Australian families will be unaware that this action could lock them into compensation levels that the families never approved,' Mr Skinner said.  

Although Professor  Giemulla only represents three German families, he is still filing his action on behalf of all passengers on board MH17.

'If he is successful, Australian families who choose to pursue further damages from Russia, Malaysia or Malaysia Air could be limited or barred by a legal action they did not authorise,' Mr Skinner told Fairfax.

While speaking to the German media, Professor Giemulla said he hopes for $1.3 million in compensation for each victim. 

Malaysian Airlines have offered $5000 to each victim, which does not include the final compensation sum. 

Discussions surrounding compensation has only just began but are expected to take years.

Around 20 Australian families have been affected by the downing of MH17, five of which are being represented by LHD Lawyers.
