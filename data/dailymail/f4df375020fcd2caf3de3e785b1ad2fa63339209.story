The heiress to the Wrigley Gum fortune came to the rescue of a US Marine by chartering a private jet to fly two dogs he rescued in Afghanistan to his new home in North Carolina.

Staff Sgt Andrew Morales had adopted the two Anatolian shepherds, named Dusty and Wyatt, while deployed in Afghanistan almost three years ago and brought them back to San Diego with him. 

But recently he was reassigned from his base in
 southern California to camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

Morales called various airlines to book travel for the dogs, but was 
told that the dogs were too big for commercial planes landing at the 
airport at his new base.

Helen Rosburg, the great-granddaughter of chewing gum industrialist William Wrigley, heard that Morales might have to lose his dogs through a plea for help on Facebook from the rescue league that helped Morales bring the dogs from Afghanistan to California.

Good Samaritan: Helen Rosburg, heiress to the Wrigley Gum fortune, is an animal lover and wanted to help Morales so he wouldn't lose his dogs

‘He was going to lose his dogs and I said "Not on my watch",’ Rosburg told ABC Affiliate WWAY.

‘He's a hero on so many different levels. The Wrigleys are an extremely patriotic family and I am a true Wrigley child.’

The thought of losing the dogs was devastating to Morales.

‘In Afghanistan, they are pretty much your best friend,’ Morales told ABC. 

'Not on my watch': He was going to lose his dogs said Rosburg, who stepped in to help

A man's best friend: Morales said he had become so close with the two dogs while in Afghanistan they were 'pretty much your best friend'

The two are brothers from the same litter, strays that were looking at grim futures before he decided to take them in.

'They've experienced some pretty bad things,' said Morales to 10 News. 'If you look at their ears, tails ... from what I understand, Afghans cut them off for fighting.'

He called the rescue league that had initially helped bring the dogs back from Afghanistan, and they made an online appeal on the family's behalf.

Rosburg acknowledged she has a reputation for rescuing animals and at-risk youth, as well as supporting the military.

‘Everybody in my circle knows what I do,’ said Rosburg. ‘If they see an impossible situation, they'll post something to my [Facebook] timeline.’

Bleak future: The two are brothers from the same litter and were strays with grim futures before Morales decided to take them in

Rosburg has a reputation for rescuing animals and at-risk youth, as well as supporting the military, which is why she stepped in to help Morales and his dogs

Rosburg is a horse exhibitor and published romance novelist who raises German shepherds for ‘personal protection, military, police, service’.

She is the founder of animal rescue organization, On the Wings of Angels Rescue, and has pigs, chickens, goats, cattle, donkeys, rabbits, cats and exotic birds on her farm in Tampa, Florida.

The Wrigley Company was founded on April 1, 1891, originally selling products such as soap and baking powder which then branched into chewing gum.

In  2008, it was announced that Mars, Incorporated would acquire Wrigley for approximately $23 billion.

Happy man: The US Marine has his two dogs with him and says he is thrilled Rosburg came to their rescue

'They quickly became a big part of our family, they're my babies,' said Kristen Morales, Andrew¿s wife

The Morales family said they were thrilled that Rosburg came to their rescue, and said they would love to thank her in person one day.

'They quickly became a big part of our family, they're my babies,' according to Kristen Morales, Andrew’s wife.

‘From the bottom of me and my wife's hearts we really appreciate what she did for us,’ said Morales.

Last year, a former Marine, Shaun Duling, raised $4,000 to be reunited with a dog he was forced to leave behind in Afghanistan.

Duling enlisted the help of an organization called Nowzad, which helps rescue animals in Afghanistan, to bring the stray back to his home in Alexandria, Virginia.
