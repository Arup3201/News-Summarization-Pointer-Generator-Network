The father of the teen who committed suicide after years of bullying said he was 'disgusted' after Facebook featured an ad for online dating which used a picture of his daughter.

The social networking site was forced to apologize and issued a statement late on Tuesday saying the ad featuring Rehtaeh Parsons was a 'gross violation' of the company's policies and has since been removed.

The ad said, 'Find Love in Canada! Meet Canadian girls and women for friendship, dating or relationships'.

The 17-year-old was taken off life support after she was found hanging in her bathroom in April, two years after she was gang-raped by classmates.

Mistake: Facebook has apologized and banned a dating company from advertising on its website after this ad featuring a photo of Rehtaeh Parsons was used

Tragedy: Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, took her life in April after enduring months of bullying after an alleged gang rape

Her father Glen Canning said the use of her photo was 'disgusting'.

'I am completely bewildered and disgusted by this,' he said. 'This is my daughter, Rehtaeh. They have her in an ad for meeting singles. I don’t even know what to say.'

Facebook said the dating website, Ionechat.com, has been banned.

The site could not be reached for comment.

Parsons'
tragic suicide brought international attention to her claims that she 
was gang-raped when she was 15 and then relentlessly tormented by 
classmates who called her a 'slut' and harassed her for sex.

Much
of the bullying was a result of a photo circulated at her school 
that showed Parsons being assaulted by a teen boy while throwing up out a
window.

The two 
18-year-olds involved have been charged with child pornography. One is accused of 
taking the picture, both are accused of circulating it.

Because the 
alleged crime took place when the men were 16, they are charged as 
juveniles and their identities cannot be revealed.

Death threats: Since Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, killed herself in April, her father, Glen Canning, pictured, has been a vocal advocate against cyberbullying and has demanded justice in her case

'Victim': Parsons, pictured, was labelled a 'slut' after she was allegedly gang raped by four teenagers in 2010

Protection: The two teenage suspects, now 18, cannot be identified under Canadian law because they were 16 when the alleged crime took place

Rehtaeh's
heartbroken parents say that she hanged herself in their bathroom two 
years after the alleged attack because she could not bear to bullying 
and torment at school.

Rehtaeh's
death led to an outcry because no one was charged or even reprimanded 
at the school - either for her rape or for the bullying.

Four boys, aged 14, 17 and two aged 
16, allegedly took it in turns to sexually assault her on November 12, 2011, after plying her with 
alcohol, she told her mother days after.

Her
mother said she saw an image of the alleged attack which showed her 
daughter being raped by a teenage boy as he gave a 'thumbs up' sign while she vomited out of a window.

Police initially concluded there were no grounds to charge anyone after a year-long investigation.

'No help': Cole Harbour High School staff failed to speak to the boys involved and Rehtaeh left

Rehtaeh
eventually closed down her Facebook page because there were so many men
asking her to have sex with them. They would say: ‘You had sex with my 
friend, so why not me?’

The
response from the school was, apparently, to do very little. Halifax 
school board spokesman Doug Hadley has said that none of the boys were 
spoken to.

Rehtaeh's death prompted the Nova Scotia government to launch reviews of
the RCMP's original investigation and the school board's handling of 
the matter.

An 
independent review released in June concluded the Halifax Regional 
School Board could have done a better job, but it was hindered by the 
fact that Rehtaeh was often absent from class.
