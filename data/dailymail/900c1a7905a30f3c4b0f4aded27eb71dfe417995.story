A woman and her husband have pleaded guilty to killing the woman's mother, who froze to death after they forced her to sleep in a shipping container in below-zero conditions.

Jassy Anglin, 53, and her husband, 56-year-old mental health worker Michael Anglin, pleaded guilty in the Hobart Supreme Court on Friday to the manslaughter of Ms Anglin's mother, 77-year-old Janet Mackozdi in July 2010.

Ms Mackozdi, who had the care requirements of a toddler, had been forced to sleep in a shipping container on the couple's property in Mount Lloyd, Tasmania, and died from hypothermia.

The court heard forensic testing had revealed the elderly woman would have been trapped in conditions between -1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius.

The couple, from Yorkey’s Knob, near Cairns, allegedly did not seal the container properly.  

In April last year, Cairns Magistrates Court was told the Anglins hatched an elaborate plot three hours after the pensioner died to wash and dress the body, then drive it to hospital in an attempt to hide the real cause of the elderly woman's death.

Once there, they told a nurse the woman died after they had set off for a trip to a national park, it was reported by the Courier Mail.

'It's alleged both defendants concocted a story instead of calling an ambulance,' Magistrate Anthony Gett said.

The Yorkeys Knob pair, who showed no emotion in court, were extradited to Tasmania to face the manslaughter charges.

The couple had moved to Cairns four years ago for lifestyle reasons and not to avoid investigations into the death, their lawyer Jefferson Mobbs told the court.
