Channel 5 has been blasted by Ofcom for broadcasting a Big Brother in which a female contestant was grabbed by the throat and threatened by another housemate.

In an episode screened last year, Daley Ojuederie grasped Hazel O'Sullivan's neck and pinned her to a bed after a heated argument.

Ojuederie was eventually asked to leave the Big Brother house over his behaviour.

Blasted: Ofcom condemned Big Brother for not clearly stating that it was unacceptable for Daley Ojuederie to grasp Hazel O'Sullivan's neck and pin her to a bed at the height of a heated argument on air

The programme was ruled by the broadcasting regulator to have breached rules on offensive content, by featuring the threatening behaviour and the late intervention over the incident.

Ojuederie's threats to O'Sullivan came after a row over a duvet when they were shut away from the others in a 'luxury house' as part of a task.

During his outburst he told her: 'Let me tell you something, little girl, have some respect for your f****** elder, 'cause if you don't... I'll finish you.'

He went on to grab O'Sullivan's throat and pinned her arms down as she lay on her bed, miming headbutting her as he threatened: 'Don't f*** with me, do you understand? Before I nut you one.'

He was called to the diary room to explain but was not banished from the show until the next day.

Controversy: He insisted he is not a malicious person after viewers reacted to his treatment of Miss O'Sullivan

Ofcom was critical of the decision not to edit the footage to limit the offence to viewers, and the 'lack of clarity' that his conduct was not acceptable.

It follows news that the reality shows sparked the most viewer complaints last year - almost 1,500.

Ofcom received 166 complaints over the neck-throttling scene within minutes of it being screened.

In total, the June series of Big Brother triggered 965 complaints and August's Celebrity Big Brother a further 438.

Viewers were outraged by housemate Jemima Slade getting an â€˜unjustified' official warning for saying black men are not her type.

Last year, Big Brother received the most viewer complaints of any show, with almost 1,500 submitted to Ofcom

Ofcom received 305 complaints in June that Slade, 41, had been 'unfairly accused of racism'.

Slade had said: 'I do go for younger guys, generally. I go for darker looking, not black, but darker features, more like Mediterranean.'

Big Brother said her language was 'unacceptable and potentially offensive'. A further 244 viewers complained that Gina Rio had bullied fellow housemate Hazel O'Sullivan.

Rio shouted at the Irish model: 'You're a pain in the a**e, a homewrecking whore, a dirty a**e skank, an ugly and disgusting cheap little tart.'
