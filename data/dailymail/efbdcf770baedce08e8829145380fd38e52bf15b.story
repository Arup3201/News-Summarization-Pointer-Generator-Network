National Front president Marine Le Pen - whose party is leading opinion polls, the latest surveys suggest

The National Front is leading opinion polls before France’s European elections next month.

The latest poll - a CSA survey for BFMTV and Nice Matin - puts their vote at 24 per cent.

This compares to 22 per cent for the UMP opposition and 20 per cent for President Francois Hollande’s Socialist Party.

It follows a massive swing to the right in local elections which led to the entire Socialist government resigning earlier this month.

Mr Hollande spoke of a ‘moral crisis’ in France, and appointed a new administration. However, his left-wing policies are still failing.

Unemployment is spiralling above the 11 per cent mark, as other polls regularly show Mr Hollande’s personal approval rating at less than 20 per cent.

This makes him by far the most unpopular head of state in the history of modern France.

The National Front (FN) enjoyed unprecedented success in the April elections - taking control of 11 key constituencies, and up to 1200 municipal seats.

Most of its gains were in areas of high unemployment and immigration, especially in the south of France and the depressed north.

‘No one can seriously deny this has been a huge victory for us,’ said FN leader Marine Le Pen, who believes they will do even better in May’s European elections.

Ms Le Pen is widely credited with having modernised the FN - moving it away from its racist and anti-Semitic roots.

She won almost 18 percent of the national vote in the first round of presidential elections two years ago, and has worked hard to ‘detoxify’ other FN members.

Her infamous father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the FN and has a number of convictions for stirring up racial hatred. 

President Francois Hollande¿s Socialist Party is currently at 20 per cent. The results follow a drastic swing to the right in local elections - leading to the resignation of the entire Socialist government

Mr Le Pen is now 85, and takes a back seat from the day to day running of the party.

Polls have regularly suggested that the FN could win up to a quarter of the popular vote in the European Parliament elections in May, but this is the first time that their vote has appeared higher than the two main governing parties in France.

The FN currently has three seats in the European parliament, compared to 11 in 1994.

Despite the FN’s widespread popular appeal, they have been viewed as a chance to protest against mainstream parties.

The FN currently only has two seats in the French National Assembly, compared to 35 in 1986.
