Manchester United chief scout Jim Lawlor was in the crowd to watch Lazio against Verona on Sunday.

Lazio's highly regarded midfielder Felipe Anderson was understood to be the object of Lawlor's attention while he also took the opportunity to check on centre-back Stefan de Vrij.

Anderson has been a revelation this season scoring ten goals and has just signed a revised contract that ties him to the club until 2020.

Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal have also checked on the Brazilian U21 international who is best friends with Barcelona star Neymar.

United's Spanish scout Carlos Ruiz also checked on Valencia defender Nicolas Otamendi last Friday. The 27-year-old centre-back was an option for United while he was at Porto and has impressed since his move with Valencia closing on qualification for the Champions League.

Valencia and United have a good relationship but the Spanish side will not sell Otamendi for less than his £37million buy-out clause.
