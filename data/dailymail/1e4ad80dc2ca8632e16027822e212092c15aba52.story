Media mogul Rupert Murdoch swatted away a shareholder revolt at News Corporation's annual general meeting last night.

A motion for the 81-year-old to step down as chairman of News International’s parent company was easily defeated in a vote at the Los Angeles meeting.

Other attempts to diminish the Murdoch family’s control also failed in the wake of the company’s huge 44 per cent share increase over the past year.

There was no mention of the £7million former News International chief Rebekah Brooks reportedly received when she resigned at the height of the phone hacking crisis in July last year.

The meeting also failed to discuss claims that James Murdoch was being lined up for a top job in charge of Fox in the U.S. despite the uproar over his handling of the scandal in Britain.

Mr Murdoch made his feelings clear in a Twitter posting in the run-up to the meeting, declaring that ‘any shareholders with complaints should take profits and sell!’

‘If you don’t like it, don’t buy the stock,’ he added in one flinty exchange with a shareholder yesterday.

Referring to the scandal that resulted in the closure of the News of the World and the arrest of Sun journalists, the Australian tycoon admitted at the meeting that the company had ‘mishaps.’

But he insisted News Corporation had ‘seized the opportunity to make amends.’

News International has now been dogged by the accusations of phone hacking at its newspapers for years.

'Golden goodbye': There was no mention at the meeting of Rebekah Brooks' £7million pay-off when she resigned over the phone hacking scandal at News International tabloid the News of the World

Now-defunct tabloid the News of the World allegedly conspired to hack the voicemail of celebrities and even the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler in 2002.

David Cameron’s former spin doctor Andy Coulson and Brooks will face trial along with five other journalists from the paper over the allegations next September.

Executives and journalists from News International publication The Sun have also been arrested over the allegations.

Despite the scandal, Brooks was awarded a bumper pay-off when she resigned over the allegations, it emerged yesterday.

The sum is thought to have consisted of cash and pension payments as well as an allowance for legal fees and the use of a chauffeur-driven car.

The award - much higher than the £1.7m cash pay-out previously reported - looked set to rile investors at today's meeting.

Mr Murdoch's words last night did not stop some institutional investors from demanding changes in the way News Corporation is run, but there was no rebellion of the kind he faced at last year’s meeting at the height of the scandal, when he again overcame calls for his ouster.

His critics did get their chance to speak at yesterday’s meeting on the Fox film studio lot – but only after he had announced that their motions had already been outvoted.

Julie Tanner, of Christian Brothers Investment Services, said it was a ‘conflict of interests’ for Mr Murdoch to serve both as chairman and as chief executive officer.

She called the company’s reforms in the wake of the phone hacking ‘timid’ and warned that without structural changes, the scandals would ‘cloud the company for the foreseeable future.’

Ian Greenwood, of the UK Local Authorities Pension Fund, supported the move to strip Mr Murdoch of the chairmanship.

‘I’d like to thank you very much for making us a lot of money – but this won’t go away as an issue,’ he added.

Even though the Murdoch family owns 13 per cent of the equity in the company, it still controls 40 per cent of the voting stock.

Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a Saudi investor and a strong supporter of Mr Murdoch, owns an additional seven per cent of the voting stock, making any real changes almost impossible without the chairman’s acquiescence.

After the 80-minute meeting, Mr Murdoch and his board of directors left without a serious blow being landed. They even got a round of applause.
