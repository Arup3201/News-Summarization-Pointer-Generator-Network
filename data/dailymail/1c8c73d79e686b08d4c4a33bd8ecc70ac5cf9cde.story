The family of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen shot dead by a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri in August, have called for their neighbors and supporters to keep calm whether or not a grand jury chooses to indict Officer Darren Wilson.

Brown's father Michael Sr. made the call for peace as he and Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden visited Geneva to ask for continued U.N. pressure on the United States government over the affair.

Back in Missouri, meanwhile, Governor Jay Nixon said on Tuesday the National Guard would be on standby to respond to any violence after the grand jury decision. 

Speaking out: Michael Brown Sr and Lesley McSpadden, parents of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown who was shot and killed by white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri last August attends a press conference on Wednesday in Geneva after a session of the United Nations Committee against Torture

Nixon said 1,000 police officers had undergone more than 5,000 hours of specialized training ahead of the grand jury decision.

Hoping such training and force would not be necessary, Brown Sr. said Wednesday:

'Me and his mother have come to the U.N. to get redress for our son,' Brown Sr. told a news conference after a session of the U.N. Committee on Torture which held a regular review of the U.S. record. 'There couldn't be a better place to do that.'

'The Brown family continue to call for non-violence. They continue to feel the Grand Jury will do the right thing,' Parks told reporters in Geneva.

In addition to the National Guard, police officers from across the state could be called on to restore order if protests get out of hand, Nixon told a news conference.

A decision by the grand jury is expected in mid-to-late November.

The August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by Darren Wilson sparked a national debate on race relations and led to weeks of street demonstrations. Some groups have threatened extensive protests if the officer is not charged with a crime.

'That ugliness was not representative of Missouri and it cannot be repeated,' Nixon said.

'These measures are not being taken because we are convinced that violence will occur, but because we have a responsibility to prepare for any contingency,' he said. 

Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist from New York, will testify before the St. Louis County grand jury on Thursday, said Adner Marcelin, public relations manager for Benjamin Crump, one of several lawyers working with Brown's family.

Conflicting witness accounts of the shooting have described a struggle between Brown and Wilson or said that Brown put his hands up.

The New York Times cited Baden as saying that Brown was shot at least six times, twice in the head.

Missouri officials did a separate autopsy.

In addition to the St. Louis grand jury investigation, there are two federal investigations under way, one into the shooting and one into wider policing practices in Ferguson.

In Missouri, Governor Jay Nixon said on Tuesday the National Guard would be on standby to respond to any violence after the grand jury decision. Nixon said 1,000 police officers had undergone more than 5,000 hours of specialized training ahead of the grand jury decision
