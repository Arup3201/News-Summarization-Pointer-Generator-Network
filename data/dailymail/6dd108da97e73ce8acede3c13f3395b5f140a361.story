Swastikas have been sprayed across the front of a Jewish fraternity house at Emory University.

Just hours after members of Alpha Epsilon Pi celebrated Yom Kippur, students awoke on Sunday to find the Nazi symbol framing their front door.

Campus officials at the Atlanta school have launched an investigation into the vandalism, branding it an 'abhorrent act' that is an offense against the entire university.

'Abhorrent': Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi at Emory University woke to find this graffiti on Sunday

In a statement to students and others on campus, University President James Wagner said: 'Among the many pernicious things the swastika symbolizes, in the last century it represented the most egregious and determined undermining of intellectual freedom and truth-seeking.

'In short, its appearance on our campus is an attack against everything for which Emory stands.'

Yom Kippur, or the day of atonement, is the holiest day of the year in the Jewish calendar and is observed by many secular Jews who may not observe other religious holidays.

Traditionally, it involves 25 hours of fasting and intensive prayer plus a number of synagogue services. 

Campus officials were meeting with student leaders to provide support and determine next steps, the statement said.

Traditional: Alpha Epsilon Pi has long prided itself on 'developing leadership for the Jewish community'

By Sunday night, the swastikas had been painted over, and officers were patrolling in front of the fraternity house, WSB-TV reported.

Students from other fraternities told the station they would be wearing Star of David and Israel symbols in solidarity with the Jewish community.

Alpha Epsilon Pi is a global Jewish fraternity with headquarters in Indianapolis, according to a description on its website, and prides itself on 'developing leadership for the Jewish community'.

Emory, which was founded in 1920, is a private school of 14,500 students just outside the city limits.
