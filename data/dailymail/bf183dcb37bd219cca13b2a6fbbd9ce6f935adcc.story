It's unusual for Apple to be playing catch up with its rivals, rather than leading the way, but its latest patent does just that.

Apple has applied to add self-healing technology to its iPhones and iPads, similar to the technology seen on LG's G Flex handset launched in October.Â 

It describes a coating that can be used anywhere on the device, filled with a material that flows into scratches and marks to make them disappear.

Apple has filed a patent that details a number of techniques to stop its iPhone and iPad screens getting scratched. These include a self-healing coating that flows and fills in scratches, a coating that is so slick, objects slide off it, and tiny, convex bumps moulded directly onto the glass to absorb scratches, pictured

Apple's patent, published yesterday by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), is titled Systems and Methods for Preventing Light Guide Plate Scratching Artifacts.

It describes a coating that can be used 
anywhere on the device, filled with a material that flows into scratches
 and marks to make them disappear.

The Californian tech giant explicit compares the coating to that seen in Japanese firm Natoco's Self Healing Cure technology.

Natoco's
 coating is made from polymer-alloy that works in two ways - it makes the surface so slippery its difficult for scratches to mark it, 
referred to as the Curling Effect.

It
 also has a Trampoline Effect which 'catches' scratches by the coating's
 chemical internal structure that acts 'like a spring, it splashes, and 
it returns it.'

This coating could be as thin as 50 nanometers, according to the patent, and could also be used to stop scratches penetrating through lower layers of the phone.

The self-healing coating is just one of the methods Apple wants to patent in order to stop its devices getting scratched or damaged.

The first details a system where the
 casing of the phone or tablet is covered with a pattern of 
tiny, convex bumps moulded directly onto the glass panel to absorb 
scratches.

The other involves a non-stick coating similar to that used by Natoco to make the surface slicker so objects 'slide' off it.

Apple has been heavily criticised in the past for its fragile devices and screens that easily smash.

Rumours in November claimed Apple's iPhone 6 would have a screen made from sapphire glass after the firm announced plans to open a mineral plant in Arizona with sapphire glass experts GT Advanced Technologies.

Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner of its latest iPhone 5S. Apple additionally protects the camera on the iPhone with a small piece of this super-strong material.

The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, hard-wearing and scratch resistant.

As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones.
