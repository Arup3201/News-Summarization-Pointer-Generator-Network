The terror group targeted by US airstrikes in Syria this week are behind the threat that caused a ban on uncharged electronic devices on American-bound flights earlier this summer, intelligence sources have claimed.

The Khorasan Group was believed to be in the final stages of a plot to blow up commercial planes with toothpaste tube bombs before they were hit by air attacks overnight on Monday.

This follows information received by security officials in July that the Al-Qaeda cell was close to perfecting bombs that could be packed into laptops, cell phones or tablets and pass through security without detection.

According to ABC News, the concerns prompted the US Transportation Security Administration to boost surveillance and increase security at American airports.

As part of the checks, security agents asked travelers to turn on their electronic devices at checkpoints and if they did not have power, they were not allowed to be taken on the plane. 

At the time, the Khorasan Group and radicals from other groups were believed to have been working with other elements in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

Their aim was to bring down a US or Europe-bound plane with a hidden bomb, with help from one of the thousands of Americans and other foreign fighters who have joined extremist groups in the Middle East.

The group is said to be made up of seasoned Al-Qaeda veterans who have travelled to Syria to find a 'safe haven'. 

The group's leader Muhsin al-Fadhli, 33, is thought to have been close to Osama bin Laden since around the time of September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States

Eric Holder, who stepped down from his post as US Attorney General earlier this week, told ABC News in July that the 'underwear bomb' threat that failed to detonate a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009 was also related to the group.

He believes it is 'more frightening than anything' that has taken place during the Obama administration.

They are also believed to have been behind the printer cartridge bomb plot against Chicago synagogues in 2010.  

The Pentagon claimed that the strikes earlier this week prevented the terror group from carrying out a plot against US airlines. 

Lieutenant General William Mayville, the Pentagon's director of operations, said Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from US warships in the region were used to hit the group's compounds, workshops and training grounds around the city of Aleppo.

'Intelligence reports indicated that the Khorasan Group was in the final stages of plans to execute attacks against Western targets and potentially the US homeland,' he said.

Khorasan is understood to intercept Westerners travelling to fight for radical groups in Syria, including ISIS.

As many of these would-be jihadists retain their passports and travel to Syria without their home nation's knowledge, Khorasan trains them not for combat in the Middle East - but rather for future terror attacks back home in the West. 

As part of the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al Qaeda-affiliated groups in Syria, FBI Director James Comey has said the government is spending 'a tremendous amount of time and effort trying to identify' anyone who's gone to Syria, but 'the challenge' is not missing anyone.

FBI director James Comey believes plans against the West by the Khorasan group may still be in the works, despite the air strikes by the US and five Arab airlines overnight on Monday 

He told reporters today that plots against the U.S. and Europe by the Khorasan Group may still be in the works and says it's possible the air strikes have not thwarted their plans. 

Comey says remains at the top of the FBI's list of terrorism concerns.He added that he also worries about a homegrown attack inspired by the Islamic State group.

The US and five Arab nations joined in airstrikes Monday and early Tuesday against the Islamic State group's headquarters in eastern Syria, using land- and sea-based US aircraft as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from two Navy ships in the region.
