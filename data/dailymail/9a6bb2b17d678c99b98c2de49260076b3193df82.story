Report: PC Shaun Jenkins, 36, was on patrol when he picked up a woman in an armed response vehicle and took her back to his house for 40 minutes while his colleague waited outside

An armed policeman who had sex on duty with a loaded gun in a holster attached to his belt has kept his job after a tribunal concluded it was similar to an officer taking a break to buy a cup of tea.

PC Shaun Jenkins, 36, was on patrol with Gwent Police in 2010 when he picked up another man's wife for a 40-minute tryst.

He took his mistress back to his home in Caerphilly, South Wales, while a colleague waited outside.

But a report into his conduct found the act did not pose a risk to public safety because he could have been back within 'a minute or two'.

An appeals tribunal report into the incident, obtained under Freedom of Information legislation by The Times, concluded that it was 'the sort of delay that will occur if an officer goes to the toilet or into a café to buy a cup of tea'.

The tribunal overturned the original decision by the Gwent Police panel to dismiss PC Jenkins, who is now a neighbourhood beat officer after he was stripped of his firearms licence.

Jenkins, who has won two awards for his bravery, was initially sacked by the force in 2011 for gross misconduct.

But he was allowed to keep his job after an appeal concluded his gun was never out of his control because he could reach it while it was in the holster by his ankles.

It also found he was still able to protect the public because he was contactable by radio.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission then questioned his reinstatement in August and said the case had undermined public confidence in the police discipline system.

Headquarters: The report into PC Jenkins' dismissal from Gwent Police said the act was similar to an officer taking a tea break or going to the lavatory

Following the decision by the Police Appeals Panel in August, the Head of the IPCC in Wales, Tom Davies, said he was ‘bemused’ by the findings and said the way Gwent Police had dealt with the case was unacceptable.

He said: ‘The finding that the gun was never out of PC Jenkins’s direct and immediate control because it was in a holster, attached to his trousers, which were attached to him, albeit around his ankles, is surprising.’

‘I am also bemused by the panel’s conclusion that his conduct did not significantly downgrade the protection to the public because there was nothing to suggest he could not have been back in the police vehicle within a minute or two.

‘These findings can only undermine public confidence in the credibility of the police discipline system.’

‘Any officer having sex on duty is unacceptable behaviour that falls well below what is expected of all police officers.

‘Those who carry firearms are rightly subject to the highest standards of training, procedures and discipline.'
