Roberto Martinez has promised Everton will not cash in on Ross Barkley this summer even if he returns from the World Cup as a superstar.

There is a buzz of anticipation around Barkley following his excellent debut season in the Barclays Premier League and the clamour is growing for Roy Hodgson to be bold and make him part of his starting line-up in Brazil.

Martinez has no doubts the midfielder belongs on the biggest stage and expects him to seize the moment if Hodgson unleashes him when Group D begins with a game against Italy in Manaus next month, insisting he has the ability to “impress millions”.

Next stage: Barkley could have the chance to impress for England in the World Cup

Hands off: Roberto Martinez says Everton will keep Barkley even if bigger sides come in for him

Should he do that, Everton will inevitably find clubs being attracted to the 20-year-old but they have plans of their own to renew his contract this summer and, according to Martinez, no offer would persuade them to do an about-turn.

‘It would be wrong for him (to leave this summer),’ said Martinez. ‘I always feel as manager you develop a relationship with players and you’re always honest with that. Ross is a phenomenal talent, probably the best English talent I have ever seen, but he is not the finished article yet.

‘It’s our duty to protect him and I know Everton is the perfect place for him for the next 12 months. We need to come along and try to get into the top four positions to offer players like Ross the next stage of their development.

‘But Ross is delighted at Everton and feels very much in the right place at the right time of his career.’

One of Barkley’s biggest attributes is his ability of not allowing big occasions to affect him and Martinez expects his reputation to be dramatically enhanced if things turn out the way Everton’s manager envisages.

‘He’s playing at a World Cup and he could be in a position to impress millions never mind just the people in England,’ said Martinez. ‘That’s the type of tournament we are talking of. But Ross will never look at it in that way, he will look at it and try to be as good as he can to help England.

‘Ross will come back the same person I can guarantee you that. He’s not someone who will lose sight of realism when he comes back. For us he’s a star whatever happens in the World Cup. He is ready now to fulfil whatever role the England manager wants to give him.’
