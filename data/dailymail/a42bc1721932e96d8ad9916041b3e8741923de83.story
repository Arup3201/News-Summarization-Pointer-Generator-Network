The former Youth Police and Crime Commissioner Paris Brown has been interviewed under caution

Paris Brown,the foul-mouthed youth crime commissioner who was forced to quit after her string of offensive Tweets, has been interviewed under caution about her comments.

The 17-year-old's mobile phone was seized and she was questioned by officers from Kent police's Special Branch.

Her lawyers described Kent Police’s response as 'wholly disproportionate' and claimed it was 'inconceivable' that her comments would be sufficient grounds for prosecution.

Olswang Solicitors accused Kent Police overreacting and accused them of having no proper basis for interviewing the teenager under caution, or making her surrender her phone, The Times reported.

Police started investigating 17-year-old former Youth Police and Crime Commissioner Paris Brown after discovering she used a racial slur in her Twitter profile.

Miss Brown resigned after it was revealed that she used her personal Twitter account to make a series of offensive, racist and homophobic posts. 

Kent Police are understood to be looking at tweets where Miss Brown uses the word 'n*****' – an offensive term for black people – in alternative spellings.

The force also confirmed it has received more than 50 complaints but is yet to decide whether Miss Brown has committed any offence.

Her account, where she posted or 
circulated more than 4,000 messages, was deleted last Saturday after 
this newspaper asked her to explain messages referring to drug use, 
underage drinking and threats of violence.

Miss Brown wrote the messages during the last six months before she was given the role of helping the force 'stay in touch with young people'.

She called homosexuals 'fags', immigrants 'illegals' and travellers 'pikeys', and said she had 'a thing for older men', an apparent reference to a teacher at her former school.

In another tweet, seemingly referring to cannabis, she wrote: 'I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.'

And she attacked the men in the reality TV programme Made In Chelsea, writing: 'Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a ******* fag.'

Paris Brown's lawyers have written to Kent Police Chief Constable Ian Learmonth about the scope and nature of the investigation

Today it emerged that Paris's lawyers, Olswang, have written to Kent Police Chief Constable Ian Learmonth about the scope and nature of the investigation, including the decision to seize her phone and for Special Branch to quiz her.

In the letter, her lawyers said: 'That appears to be wholly disproportionate and unjustified having regard to the Twitter material itself and the broader circumstances of the case.'

They said Paris, from Sheerness, Kent, was visited by a Special Branch officer at her home on April 11, along with a second officer, and asked to surrender her mobile for examination.

Then she was requested to attend an interview under caution on April 14.

She was quizzed for one hour and seven minutes about material posted on her Twitter account which had already been published in the media. Her phone was returned three days later.

In their letter, her lawyers said: 'As we are sure that you will readily understand, being subject to a police investigation is highly distressing for any person, but especially so for a teenager, particularly one who has been recently subject to such adverse media coverage.

'In such circumstances, we believe that the police must weigh carefully the extent to which an investigation relating solely to social media activity is merited.'

Olswang also referred to the interim guidelines from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Keir Starmer, regarding prosecutions relating to social media.

Paris's lawyers said it was 'immediately apparent' from reviewing the Twitter material that it would be 'inconceivable' that they would form sufficient grounds for a prosecution.

'There is nothing in the Twitter material which could be deemed, even on its face, to be grossly offensive or otherwise unlawful,' the letter added.

'There was therefore no proper basis on which to require our 17-year-old client to surrender her mobile telephone, to caution her or to subject her to a detailed police interview whilst under caution.'

But Kent Police have defended their actions, saying they are reacting to complaints from members of the public and are seeking to establish whether any offences have been committed.

'Kent Police received more than 50 complaints from members of the public and are currently investigating to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed in relation to this incident.

'Kent Police disagrees with the interpretation of the investigation given.

'Officers must first determine the extent of the misuse of social media so that the Crown Prosecution Service can then, taking into account the DPP's interim guidance, determine whether or not any potential evidence meets the set criteria for a prosecution.

'We will investigate all complaints thoroughly but cannot comment further on the progress of a live investigation.'
