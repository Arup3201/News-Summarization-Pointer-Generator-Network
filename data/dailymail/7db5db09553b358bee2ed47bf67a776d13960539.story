The extent to which savers have been ‘punished’ since the credit crunch was laid bare last night.

Low interest rates since the 2007/08 crash have seen those who have sensibly saved throughout their lives losing thousands of pounds - while delivering a bonanza for borrowers.

Research by financial expert Ros Altmann shows that someone with £100,000 in the bank has lost up to £21,000 since the start of 2008 thanks to the interest they will no longer be earning on their savings.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has suggested rates will not rise in the near future - committing savers to years' more misery

Every year, the interest income on their money is at least £4,250 lower than it would have been in December 2007, when base rates were higher.

But a borrower with a £100,000 mortgage has enjoyed a bonanza since the start of 2008, saving more than £19,000 if they are on a standard variable rate deal.

Mortgage repayments are now almost £3,300 a year cheaper than they would have been at the end of 2007.

The differing fortunes have occurred because Bank of England base rates are now just 0.5 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent before the downturn.

Pensioners are disproportionately affected, because they are more likely to have a savings pot than a mortgage.

Even though the economy is now clearly recovering, bank governor Mark Carney has suggested rates will not rise in the near future - committing savers to years’ more misery.

Ms Altmann, a former adviser to the Treasury on pensions, said savers had been made the ‘sacrificial lamb’ by the government which was keen to see interest rates low in the aftermath of the credit crunch.

And she said she was concerned that many borrowers have been lulled into a false sense of security and will not be able to afford mortgage payments once base rates eventually rise.

She said: ‘Britain has always valued savers in the past, and people have always been encouraged to save. But we’re not in danger of losing that culture.

'It’s the scale of the gains and losses that is stark. It is quite staggering the enormous amounts that borrowers have gained by compared to the extent to which savers are losing out.

‘Savers have put money aside sensibly for the future, expecting to have an income in retirement. They have made careful plans so they can set aside money to give them income in retirement.

'But all their plans are up in smoke because over the past six years they have lost money month on month.

‘What has happened is that savers have been made a sacrificial lamb in order to help people borrow sums of money at record low rates.’

The research finds that a person with a £100,000 standard variable rate mortgage would have paid interest of £7,680 a year in December 2007. But now the interest stands at just £3,280 a year.

This works out at a saving of £3,290 a year or £274 a month. Ms Altmann said that over the past six years that is a cumulative saving of more than £19,000. Those on tracker mortgages would save slightly less.

Conversely, for someone who has £100,000 of savings in a fixed rate bonds, annual interest in December 2007 was £5,990 - but by December 2013 it had fallen to £1,440 a year.

This is a loss of £4,550 a year, or £379 a month. Over the past six years it will have added up to a loss of nearly £21,000.

For someone whose money is in a Cash ISA, the loss will be slightly less - around £4,260 a year.Ms Altmann added: ‘This shows that anyone with a mortgage has benefited hugely from higher incomes at the expense of those who saved and didn’t want to borrow large sums.

‘People with large mortgages have had an enormous boost to their income, whereas people who have put money aside for the future have seen income fall to support those with huge mortgages. There comes a point when you have to ask whether this is socially equitable.

‘Every society needs savers but what is happening is we are discouraging savers and giving the impression that it is just not worth borrowing,

‘The danger for the future of the economy is that no country can survive in the long run if all we do is help borrowers and punish savers.

‘And once rates go up, many borrowers may find they cannot support the additional costs. They may have been misled on the mortgages they can afford’

It comes after a poll over Christmas found that most people - especially pensioners - want to see interest rates rise.

Over all ages, more people think they will win rather than lose out from higher interest rates - a boost to David Cameron as a rate hike becomes more likely in the run-up to the next election.

The YouGov survey showed that two thirds of people think an increase would either make no difference or improve their personal finances.

Pensioners are particularly in favour. Some 50 per cent of the over-60s believe a rise in interest rates would make them better off - compared to just 7 per cent who say their finances would suffer.

Lesley Daniels, divisional manager for Victim Support in Greater Manchester, said: ‘While we are currently assessing the extent of the help provided in this case by Victim Support, we can confirm that Tracy was given support at court through our Witness Service.

‘We know it takes real courage to come forward and make an allegation of rape and that many complainants find going through the criminal justice process a very distressing experience. However, it will be for an inquest to determine the full facts and circumstances of this tragic death.’
