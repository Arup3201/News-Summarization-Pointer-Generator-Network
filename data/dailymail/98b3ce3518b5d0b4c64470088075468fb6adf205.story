A alleged fraudster was arrested on Friday just as he was proposing to his girlfriend, but a kind-hearted cop let him finish the deed and even handed the ring over to the bride-to-be as the arrested man was already in handcuffs.

Justin Harrel, 32, had planned a romantic proposal where he would ask his girlfriend Elaina Rios by the carousel in Elk City, Oklahoma, during the city's Christmas In The Park extravaganza on Friday night.

All was going according to plan, until an off-duty police officer, Lt. Detective Steve Bonds, recognized hapless Harrell as someone who had several arrest warrants out against him in connection with bounced checks.

Justin Harrel, 32, was arrested on Friday just as he was proposing to his girlfriend, Elaina Rios, but a kind-hearted cop let him finish the deed and even handed the ring over to the bride-to-be

Harrel has been languishing in the county jail since Friday's arrest and, right, the ring which Rios has said she will need to get resized before their wedding

When Bonds cuffed him, Harrel begged him for five minutes because he was just about to propose to his girlfriend.

‘He said "Can you give me five minutes? Can you give me five minutes?" He said "I'm just fixing to propose to my girlfriend". He said "Yeah go ahead and do that". "Can you uncuff me?" "No,"' Elk City Police Chief Eddie Holland told Newson6.

Bonds refused to take his handcuffs off 
Harrel, but took pity on his predicament and even helped by reaching 
into the arrested man’s pocket and handing the ring over to Rios.

There was no time for celebrations, as Harrel was then carting away to the county jail, where he remained as of Wednesday night. 

Standing by her man: Rios said that although everyone thinks Harrel is a bad guy, she thinks he is just misunderstood

The proposal - and arrest - took place by this covered carousel in Elk City, Oklahoma, during the city's Christmas In The Park extravaganza on Friday night

Local police chief Eddie Holland said the incident was 'policing at its best with a heart'

Fortunately for Harrel, the incident hasn’t perturb his bride-to-be, who claims her fiance is just misunderstood.

‘We're best friends. He completes me. He's my rock and I'm his rock. Everybody thinks he's a bad guy and he's not,’ Rios told Newson6.

The unusual story certainly gives the couple an amusing anecdote for their wedding day, but first Rios says she needs to get her ring re-sized as it is presently too small.

Police Chief Holland said the incident was ‘policing at its best with a heart.’

‘And it's Christmas time. People have lives, and we help them our best to live those lives,’ he said.
