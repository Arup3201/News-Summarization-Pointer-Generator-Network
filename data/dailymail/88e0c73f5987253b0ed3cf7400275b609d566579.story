It's the hottest, most consistently sunny summer many of us can remember, but dressing for hot weather continues to challenge us.

One quirky brand has decided to embrace the little perils of summer dressing with a new eyebrow-raising fashion range.

Japan-based retailer Village Vanguard has come
 up with two new T-shirts which make the wearer appear to be committing snigger-inducing fashion faux pas.

This top, dubbed the Wet Swimsuit T-Shirt, created the illusion that you're wearing swimwear underneath

This cheeky transparent bra back print top is actually aimed at men, as a (very confusing) novelty item

The first design 
looks as if it is drenched before you even put it on.

In fact, it's designed to make the wearer appear to have pulled a plain white top over a wet dark navy swimsuit - thus causing the top to go soggy and see-through.

It's aptly called the Soaked-through School Swimsuit T-shirt, and with it the makers saying they are celebrating the 
'idiocy of summertime'.

If you'd rather not give the 
impression that you're slippery to the touch, but still want to raise a 
few eyebrows this summer, Village Vanguard's second titillating T-shirt 
is just the thing.

It features a barely-there outline of black bra straps on the back and the quirky top is actually designed for blokes.

Quite why, we can't tell, but the so-called Transparent Bra Men's T-shirt is sure to raise a few confused eyebrows down the pub.

The front is a little more modest, with just a small bra logo stitched into it.

Both designs retail for 2,808 yen (£16.40) each and are exclusive to Village Vanguard's online store.

The wet t-shirt version is available to buy now (reportedly selling fast), while pre-orders are currently being taken for the men's bra option reports RocketNews24.
