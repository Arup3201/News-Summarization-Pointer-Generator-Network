They assembled their legions like Russian generals on a battlefield: Roman Abramovich, one of the wealthiest men in the world, versus Boris Berezovsky, once regarded as the Soviet Union’s most powerful oligarch.

Among their armouries were some of the nation’s finest and most expensive legal brains, a battalion of personal bodyguards, mountains of paperwork and evidence… not to mention a couple of classy looking redheads.

Against a backdrop of the High Court in London, this was day one of what looks set to become Britain’s most epic legal wrangle.

Accused: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich arrives at the High Court with his entourage for the start of the case against Boris Berezovsky

Mr Abramovich is being sued by Mr Berezovsky for alleged breach of trust and breach of contract over the Sibneft share deal

And at a cost of something like £50 a second when it opened yesterday, probably among its most expensive.

At stake is not just the question of a £3.2billion damages claim against the celebrated Chelsea Football Club owner, but the reputations and credibility of both men, once said to have been friends and business partners.

Berezovsky accuses Abramovich of having ‘betrayed and blackmailed’ him over the sale of oil shares, ‘intimidating’ him into getting rid of them at a fraction of their true value.

The 65-year-old, who fled to Britain from Russia 11 years ago after falling out with those in power, alleges breach of trust and breach of contract over the deal, struck after the collapse of communism during the 1990s.

Yesterday Laurence Rabinowitz QC, for Berezovsky, told Mrs Justice Gloster the two men had worked together to acquire Russian oil company Sibneft.

‘This is a case about two men who worked together to acquire an asset that would make them wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of most people,’ he said.

Support: Mr Berezovsky was joined in the High Court by girlfriend Yelena Gorbunova (centre) and security guards

They were ‘good friends’ until Berezovsky became an enemy of the Kremlin through his increasingly political profile and his ownership of influential media outlets.

The oligarch says he was forced to sell his shares in Sibneft and in the Russian aluminium giant Rusal before leaving the country, for fear they would fall into the hands of Russian authorities.

Abramovich, said the QC, ‘was in effect required to make a choice – to remain loyal to Mr Berezovsky ... or instead, as we submit, to betray Mr Berezovsky and to seek to profit from his difficulties.

‘It is our case that Mr Abramovich at that point demonstrated that he was a man to whom wealth and influence mattered more than friendship and loyalty.’

Turning point: It is alleged Mr Abramovich betrayed Mr Berezovsky after the latter fell out of favour with political leaders at the Kremlin, then led by President Vladimir Putin (above)

Six years ago the Chelsea owner, currently said to be worth £10.3billion, sold Sibneft to Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly in a multi-billion dollar deal

Now he denies Berezovsky’s claims and insists the two men were never friends or partners. He says he had simply hired Berezovsky to protect him from Chechen criminal gangs as the initial deal went through.

His lawyers have yet to outline their case in court, but in written arguments before the judge they said Berezovsky’s accusations were ‘devoid of merit’ and his evidence had ‘an overtly political purpose’.

The complex story of everyday Russian billionaires unfolded as the two men sat 20 yards apart.

Both are expected to give evidence and
each packed the court with some of the country’s top lawyers. 
Abramovich alone had three QCs and a clutch of juniors and solicitors. 
Team Berezovsky, whose security men include ex-Foreign Legionnaires, 
filled his side of the court. Legal fees are thought to have topped 
£1million for the five hours the court sat.

The case is expected to last up to three months.
