Seven football supporters who chanted songs that ‘glorified and idolised’ the murderer of Stephen Lawrence were jailed today.

The Charlton Athletic fans, who had been at an FA Cup match against Fulham in January 2012, were jailed for their abusive behaviour on a train from Putney to Waterloo in south-west London.

The men - aged from 22 to 31, who had been at Craven Cottage - were convicted of causing racially aggravated fear of violence after witnesses complained of sexual and racially motivated abuse.

Guilty: Ben Boylett (left) was sentenced to 12 
months in prison and an eight-year football banning order and Sean Fowle (right) received eight months in prison and an eight-year football banning 
order

Punished: Jake Embery (left) was sentenced to 
six months in prison suspended for 18 months and a four-year banning order, and Aaron Phinbow (right) was 
sentenced to eight months in prison and given a eight-year ban

British Transport Police said the 
group chanted in support of Gary Dobson, three days after he was 
convicted of murdering Stephen Lawrence. They were sentenced today at 
Blackfriars Crown Court.

Baljit
Ubhey, the Crown Prosecution Service’s London Chief Crown Prosecutor, 
said: ‘These men were singing and chanting racist abuse in praise of the
convicted murderers of Stephen Lawrence.

‘To
glorify and idolise these men was disturbing and upsetting. Their 
racially and sexually abusive language left members of the public 
shocked and disgusted.

‘Witnesses
said they felt intimidated and feared there was a real and significant 
risk of violence. I would like to thank the witnesses who came forward 
and gave evidence to support this prosecution.

Sentenced: Jason Butler (left) was given 12 
months in prison and an eight-year football banning order, and David 
Bone (right) was handed 18 months in prison and an eight-year football 
banning order

In court: Daniel Clay (left) was sentenced to 18 months in prison and given an eight-year ban. The group chanted in support of Gary Dobson (right), three days after he was convicted of murdering Stephen Lawrence

‘I hope these convictions stand as a warning that racist and abusive behaviour will not be tolerated in our city.’

Mick
Everett, Charlton FC's Head of Operations, said: ‘The club was shocked 
to hear of the rowdy, intimidating behaviour, and the chanting of racist
songs on a train by a handful of our supporters.

‘Their actions are totally condemned by everyone at the club and indeed, I am sure, by Charlton supporters everywhere.

‘Although
this isolated incident does not reflect on the overwhelming majority of
our fans, these arrests are a kick in the teeth to everyone associated 
with the club, who have put so much effort into our campaign over the 
years.

Stance: Charlton Athletic FC (whose ground The Valley is pictured) are planning additional sanctions on the fans

Ground: The fans were at an FA Cup game against Fulham at Craven Cottage (pictured) in South-West London

‘The club will now look to impose additional appropriate sanctions on those involved.’

Killed: Stephen Lawrence was murdered in April 1993 in Eltham, south-east London

BTP Detective Sergeant Jane Hill said: ‘The actions of these men were both offensive and extremely intimidating to other passengers on board the train at the time.

‘An investigation was swiftly launched to gather evidence and by working closely with Charlton Athletic FC, coupled with excellent CCTV footage, intelligence reports and statements from witnesses, we were able to move quickly to trace the men.’

She added: ‘This minority blight the rail journeys of many ordinary passengers and stain the reputation of the game and the country. They also continue to cause us problems that require significant resources to contain.’

David Bone, 23, of Woolwich, south-east London, and Daniel Clay, 31, of Grove Park, south-east London, received 18 months in prison and an eight year football banning order.

The same eight year match ban was imposed on Ben Boylett, 26, of London, and Jason Butler, 31, of Abbey Wood, south-east London, who were also given one year in prison.

Sean Fowle and Aaron Phinbow, both also of Abbey Wood and aged 25, also received an eight year ban and eight months behind bars.

Jake Embery, 22, of Orpington, south-east London, was given a six month suspended sentence, a four year match ban and ordered to pay £3,000 costs.
