It was just before Thanksgiving when a two-year old boy from central Arkansas vanished from his home, but his family are still holding out hope that he may still be found alive and well.

Little Malik Drummond, who is autistic, apparently disappeared from his home one Sunday night in late November and hasn't been seen since.

Initially it was thought the toddler simply wandered off but now his family and police too suspect foul play.

Malik's mom, Tanya, says the entire family are waiting for a sign of the the little boy. 

'I just want to know where he's at, how's he's doing, and what's going on? I just really want him home,' says Drummond.

Mrs Drummond says life for her two-year-old daughter Arianna has been tough without her twin brother Malik.

'She's always asking about him,' she said in an interview with Fox 16 with tears in her eyes.

Plea: 'I just want to know where he's at, how's he's doing, and what's going on? I just really want him home, ' says mother Tanya Drummond

'I haven't been able to sleep. I've been crying a lot,' she said. 

'I don't want sympathy. I want people to still pray for us. I want everybody to keep Malik in their prayers. To help bring him home,' says Mrs Drummond. 

Officers say while Malik's father was asleep, the toddler disappeared from his Searcy home back in November. 

A massive search involving Police and the community turned up no clues whatsoever. Two months later, he's still missing.

Flyers of the missing boy have been handed around local businesses reminding people to keep an eye out for him.

'We are urging the public if they see something or they know something or they hear something that may lead us to Malik...That they do call us,' says Searcy Corporal Steve Hernandez.

Heartbroken: Until they do find him, the Drummond family says they need the community to help with one last effort

Hopeful: Malik's grandmother still has unwrapped Christmas presents. She says they'll be opened when her grandson is home again

Malik's grandmother still has unwrapped Christmas presents. She says they'll be opened when her grandson is home again.

'I just wanted to show everybody Malik is still ours forever,' says Grandmother Nancy Paine.

Drummond says the holidays were painful, and the pain hasn't gone away in the new year.

When the search began before Thanksgiving bloodhounds and cadaver dogs were used to look for the boy. 

Nearby houses,including abandoned homes were searched. Even ditches and sewers were drained and examined.

For weeks, volunteers poured into Searcy to help find Malik, but we're told search efforts have been scaled back.

Optimistic: 'I don't want sympathy. I want people to still pray for us. I want everybody to keep malik in their prayers. To help bring him home,' says Mom Tanya

Last hope: Police say Malik went missing from his Searcy home back in November. A massive search involving Police and the community turned up no clues. 10 weeks later, he's still missing

Mystery: Officers say while Malik's father was asleep, the toddler wandered away. Since then, flyers of the missing boy decorated Searcy businesses reminding people to keep an eye out

Right now police are focusing on credible tips from the public and have recently sent divers into the Little Red River, about five miles from Malik's home.

As the weeks turn into months, it's hard not to feat the worst for Malik. 

'Everything doesn't add up. Things don't add up at all,' his mother, said. She is desperately searching for answers. 

Initial reports suggested Malik left the home by himself, but she believes he was taken.

'We think he was kidnapped, but we're not sure. From our point of view, we think he's been kidnapped,' she suggested.

And even with more questions than answers, Malik's mother isn't giving up hope, keeping her phone by her side waiting for the call that could reunite her with her son.

Tough times: Tanya Drummond says the holidays were painful, and the pain hasn't gone away in the new year and has been crying a lot

'It's hard to not cry. I cry when I'm not around anybody because I'm trying to show people that I'm strong. I'm trying to keep my head up for my baby,' she said. 'I'm trying to do the best I can for him.'

The child is about 3-feet tall and 40 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a blue shirt and brown pants with stripes.

Police have said there is no evidence of foul play in the boy's disappearance, but that foul play has not been ruled out. 

Police have said that as part of standard procedure, family members have been given lie detector tests.
