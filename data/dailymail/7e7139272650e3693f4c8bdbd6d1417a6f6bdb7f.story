Council workers are being told to own up about any office romances or affairs as part of a new code of conduct requiring them to confess 'close personal relationships' to their bosses.

Employees of Ipswich Borough Council in Suffolk have been told to discretely let their line manager know of any trysts or other 'close relationships' after a new code of conduct was brought in.

The fresh set of rules was designed to combat 'conflicts of interest' at the local authority, and to give 'very clear details of what is and is not acceptable'.

The code, introduced in March, even extends to people who do not work for the council, but do business with it in some other way.

However, the change has sparked concerns that the authority could end up prying into the personal lives of staff.

Employment lawyer Julie Temple from Ipswich-based Quantrills, said staff codes of conduct are common, but could later land the council in legal trouble.

She said: 'I can see what the council is trying to do by introducing this code of conduct and I can understand that they see it as necessary.

'However I think it is almost certain that someone somewhere will challenge a code like this under human rights legislation.'

But the council denies claims of snooping and says the code only applies when there is a risk of a conflict of interest arising.

Council leader David Ellesmere insisted the rules are merely a matter of 'common sense'.

He said: 'This is really in place to protect our staff against claims that they might show favour to someone they are close to - it is really a matter of common sense.

'It is something that is fairly common. We are not banning relationships - but we need to know if they are going to impact on council business'.

The new code states: 'Employees must declare any Close Personal Relationship with another employee of the Council where the relationship could cause, or be perceived to cause, a conflict of interest'.

'In such instances there may be a need to consider alternative employment for one of the employees concerned'.

Ipswich council recently pledged to tighten up its staff rules after a report recommended a more stringent code of conduct. It said the new 'rules-based' code would make it easier to 'monitor compliance' and would give 'very clear details of what is and is not acceptable'.

A council spokesman said: 'The code only requires employees to disclose, in confidence, to their line manager any close personal relationships where there is a risk of a conflict of interest arising.

'Examples where an employee would be expected to disclose a close personal relationship include cases where an employeeâ€™s spouse or partner is the managing director of a company bidding for a council contract.

'Internally the code would be applied where two employees who both work for the council are in a close relationship and one is responsible for managing the other or could be involved in selection for promotion or redundancy'.

Suzanne Williams, Ipswich representative for Unison, said the union was consulted on the changes to the new code of conduct and she has received no complaints.
