Brazil forward Neymar is recovering ‘very well’ from the fractured vertebra that ended his World Cup, according to Barcelona medical staff.

Doctors from the Catalan club visited the 22-year-old at his home in Brazil to examine his condition and check on his progress following the injury he suffered during Brazil's quarter-final victory over Colombia.

Defender Juan Zuniga jumped straight through the back of Neymar and fractured the vertebrae in his back, forcing him out of Brazil's humiliating 7-1 semi-final defeat to Germany on Tuesday.

Neymar is expected to be out for between four and six weeks as he recovers from his fractured back, which was extremely close to paralysing him according to medical experts.

‘The injury is progressing very well and from August 5 the player will continue his treatment and the final stage of his recovery in Barcelona,’ Barca said on their website.

Doctors from the La Liga club confirmed the diagnosis made by the Brazilian Soccer Federation (CBF) and agreed to the course of treatment which the South Americans had suggested for Neymar.

Brazil national team captain Thiago Silva was also absent from the devastating semi-final defeat through suspension and the Selecao sorely missed their two star players.

National newspapers in Brazil slammed their side for the humbling loss to Germany in their home World Cup, preventing the side from challenging for the tournament in the final at the Maracana on Sunday.
