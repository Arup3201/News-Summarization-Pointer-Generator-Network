A married policeman who ‘used his uniform’ to attract women for sex while on duty has been sacked.

In one case, PC Troy Van-Eda, 44, took charity support worker Joanne Pinder, 34, into a police station boiler room after pulling her over for failing to wear a seat belt.

The couple began a six-year affair during which Van-Eda often visited her at home for intimate relations while he was supposed to be working.

Dismissed: PC Troy Van-Eda has been sacked from Greater Manchester Police for having sex with five women while on duty

But when Miss Pinder discovered she was 
just one of five women he had bedded while at work, she reported him to 
his bosses at Greater Manchester Police, who launched an investigation.

Van-Eda denied the allegations, claiming he was the victim of malicious 
lies. But at a disciplinary hearing this week, a panel of senior 
officers dismissed his version of events and he was sacked for gross 
misconduct.

He plans to appeal.

Liaison: Joanne Pinder claimed she had sex with Mr Van-Eda in the boiler room of Littleborough Police Station, near Rochdale

Last night Miss Pinder, of Rochdale, revealed how she fell for Van-Eda 
after he pulled her over for not wearing a seat belt in April 2004.

‘He asked me to get into his van. We started talking and I asked if he 
was going to do me for the seat belt. He laughed and asked for my phone 
number.’

Miss Pinder said Van-Eda arranged to meet her at Littleborough police 
station in the town the following day. ‘When I got there, he said: “Come
in, do you want a brew, we’ll go in the boiler room”.

We had sex in the
boiler room and the relationship went on from there.’

Miss Pinder told the hearing Van-Eda visited her at home while on duty 
and that they also slept together at Milnrow police station in the town.

Three years into their affair, Van-Eda confessed that he was married with three children, but separated from his wife.

Miss Pinder stood by him until June 2010, when she discovered he was 
seeing another woman, who claimed she was engaged to him. Miss Pinder 
confronted Van-Eda and ended the affair. ‘Then, a short time later, I 
discovered he had been sleeping with other women,’ she said.

‘From that moment, it all snowballed. I got phone numbers of other women
who claimed he had been with them on duty and I made a formal 
complaint.’

Van-Eda, a former special constable with West Yorkshire Police, was 
accused of gross misconduct but allowed to continue working on 
restricted duties while an investigation was carried out.

Five women who claimed to have slept with him gave evidence at the two-day hearing into his conduct.

Miss Pinder said: ‘He used his police uniform to feed his obsession with women.’

Manchester Assistant Chief Constable, Dawn Copley, said: ‘This officer’s
behaviour was completely unacceptable. [He] has been found guilty of 
gross misconduct and dismissed without notice.’

Last night Van-Eda, also of Rochdale, who lives with his fiancée, 
Rachael Smith, said he would appeal against the decision. ‘I deny all 
the allegations and have lost my job for nothing,’ he added.
