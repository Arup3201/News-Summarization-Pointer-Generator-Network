Doctor Roger Mugford has the best burglar alarm system in the world – his reputation.

Known from television and radio 
appearances as the ‘dog whisperer’, Mugford spends his life surrounded 
by vicious canines, as  he tames them for their wealthy owners, 
including royalty.

You imagine a pack of slavering hounds patrolling his grounds.

So it’s a surprise when I arrive at 
his country house outside Chertsey, Surrey, to find dog behaviourist 
Mugford with only a deaf, cuddly 16-year-old ‘Battersea mutt’ called PC 
(named after Prince Charles, whose distant demeanour he is said to 
share) and Bounce, a labrador with impeccable manners.

In the conservatory I confess to being
relieved at the reception. ‘Hmm, wait until you meet the other two,’ 
says Roger, 67, with a twinkle in his eye, before making a quick call on
his mobile.

Within minutes his son, James, 24, 
appears clutching leads on which are tethered Jason, a German shepherd 
whose darting eyes give the distinct impression he is not to be messed 
with, and Humphrey, a Staffordshire mastiff cross who makes an immediate
lunge at parts of my body I’d prefer to keep.

‘I got them both from the courts where they were about to be put down,’ says Mugford, patting and calming both dogs.

‘In the case of Humphrey, a very 
funny Crown Court judge announced, “Humphrey Mugford, I sentence you to 
live with Roger Mugford for the rest of your life.” He is no problem, 
living here. Sadly, Staffies are one of the nicest breeds of dogs owned 
by some of the nastiest people.’

Worth taking the plunge: After restoring the four-bedroom mansion, Roger has put it on the market for £1.25million

Roger finds a story behind most 
things, including his house – one half of a 19th Century mansion. ‘I 
found details of its history with the deeds,’ he says.

It was built in 1870 for Mary Augusta 
Holland, of Holland Park in London fame, by her husband, Charles Fox, 
whose father was a notable Whig politician, because she was scandalising
polite London society. 

So she was sent here to the country and it 
seems she scandalised Surrey too, although we aren’t sure how.’

Roger bought the house three years ago
for £765,000 as a renovation project because he ‘felt sorry for it’.

The heating didn’t work; the roof needed mending; the wiring was 
dangerous; the colour scheme was out of Footballers’ Wives; and as it 
had been empty for some time, thieves had stolen stone from the terrace.

At a cost of £200,000, the house is 
now beautifully restored. Roger proudly shows off the large, modern 
kitchen leading to the elegant hall with black-and-white tiled floor, 
then two beautifully proportioned living rooms.

Upstairs, a grand landing has arches 
leading to four bedrooms. The colour scheme – muted pastels and light 
green shades – is soothing and the views, over farmland to the Surrey 
Hills, are to die for.

Curiously, Roger spends most of his 
time in his large, untidy conservatory. Here, over tea, he regales me 
with tales of his royal clients. ‘

The Queen is very knowledgeable and 
very authoritative, which is good because democracy doesn’t work with 
animals,’ he says of the time he was summoned to correct the Royal 
corgis after they attacked Princess Beatrice’s terrier.

He was even more impressed by Princess
Anne, for whom he appeared in court when she was convicted under the 
Dangerous Dog Act in 2002 after her bull terrier, Dotty, attacked two 
children.

‘Before we went into court, she whispered, “If I go down, just
remember one thing – St Helena  is a long way away” – referring to the 
days when people would be banished there.’

The gardens, which Roger has also 
rescued, are a mixture of formality, in the rebuilt terrace and elegant 
swimming pool, and the unruly, in an area of wild garden.

The house, admittedly, suffers road 
noise from the M25, but it is an easy commute to London and it isn’t on 
the flight paths. It would suit a family, perhaps with a horse-loving 
child, as Roger owns adjoining land and would sell or rent a field to a 
future owner.

As for Roger, he already owns a bungalow nearby and intends replacing it with an  eco-house that he will design himself.

Dr Roger Mugford’s house in St Ann’s 
Hill Road, Chertsey, is for sale at £1.25 million with bartonwyatt.co.uk
