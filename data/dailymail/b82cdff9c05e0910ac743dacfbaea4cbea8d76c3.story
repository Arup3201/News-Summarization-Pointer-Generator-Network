Bungling workmen painted yellow zig zag lines outside a former school without realising that it had closed and been demolished four years ago.

The contractors seemingly didn't notice that they were painting 'school' on the road next to an empty field in Chester.

The council closed Woodfield Primary in 2008 because there were too few children, and it was demolished a year later.

Blunder: Workman painted yellow zig-zag lines on the road outside this empty field four years after the school was demolished in Chester

Roadworkers were instructed to paint the lines by the local authority and they diligently did the job without realising anything was wrong.

It is believed the contractors were given an out of date list of sites that needed painting - and simply did away and did what they were told.

They are thought to have painted a number of other lines around the town which weren't needed.

Shirley Wingfield, spokeswoman at 
Cheshire West and Chester Council, which carried out the work, said: 
'The road markings have been painted by mistake. They will be removed 
when our workers are next in the area.'

One local resident said: 'We wondered what was going on when the workmen turned up. We couldn't believe it when we came home later on and saw the markings had been redone.

Mistake: The council will now send workman back to remove the freshly-painted yellow warning lines

'That
road can be busy but I don't think there is much chance of any pupils 
crossing it to get to the school anytime soon. It's a bit of a joke 
really.'

The site has been earmarked for an extra care housing scheme for older people, scheduled to open in 2015.

Councillor
Adrian Walmsley said: 'I was made aware of the 
road markings and I reported it to the council's highways department as 
soon as I found out.

'Highways officers admitted it was their error, not the contractors, and have told me they will sort it out.'
