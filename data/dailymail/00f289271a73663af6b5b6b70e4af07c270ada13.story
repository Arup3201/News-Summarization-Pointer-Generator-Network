JPMorgan Chase & Co. says that this summer's cyberattack affected 76 million households and seven million small businesses. 

Customer information including names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses could have been 'compromised', according to a document sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The 'previously disclosed attack', which took place in July, also impacted internal data held by the New York-based bank relating to users.

Data breach: The New York-based bank have filed a report to the Securities and Exchange Commission saying 76 million customers could have been hit by the latest breach

However the firm says there is no evidence that account information, such as account numbers, passwords or Social Security numbers, was stolen, meaning customers' money is safe. 

The bank says it has not seen any unusual customer fraud related to the hack. They added that customers who report unauthorized transactions to them will not be liable.  

Earlier the firm denied a
report in the New York Times on Thursday that its computer
system had been breached for the second time in about three
months.

'The story is false. We are not aware of any new attack,' 
JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an email.

The newspaper corrected its story to say that the earlier
version of the headline misstated the extent of the cyber
security issues at the bank.

Document: The firm filed a report to the Securities and Exchange Commission today outlining the issues that had occurred 

At risk: It said that the breach had 'compromised' user contact information - including name, address, phone number and email address - as well as internal JP Morgan data relating to these clients 

Increased security: James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of J.P. Morgan, wrote in his annual shareholder letter this year that the bank will spend more than $250 million annually on cybersecurity 

'While the bank found evidence of previously unknown
hacking, it says the latest discovery does not constitute a
breach separate from an earlier one,' NY Times said.

The New York Times DealBook column, citing people with
knowledge of the matter, had reported that the biggest U.S. bank
had found that hackers with links to Italy had gained entry to
some of its servers.

James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of J.P. Morgan, wrote in his annual shareholder letter this year that the bank will spend more than $250 million annually and have about 1,000 people focused on cybersecurity by the end of 2014. 

The bank operates in more than 60 countries around the world, however it is unknown how many in each country have been affected.  

In August, Bloomberg reported that the FBI was investigating a possible attack that may have come from Russia. 

Sources close to the probe said it could have been a response to the government-sponsored sanctions imposed as a result of the crises in Ukraine.
