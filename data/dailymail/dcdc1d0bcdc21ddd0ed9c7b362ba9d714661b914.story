A bomb squad has been called to a residential street when police discovered possible explosives in the back of a vehicle.

However, after 10 hours of investigations the squad was still unable to confirm whether or not the suspicious parcel contained explosives.

A woman had been stopped by a Random Breath and Drug Testing Unit at 2.50am in inner northern Perth suburb Mount Lawley.

The driver 'aroused suspicion' leading to a search of the car and police discovering the questionable package, according to ABC News. 

The female driver has been detained following the discovery of 'possible explosives' in her vehicle

It was at this point that the possible explosives were detected. 

Police  cordoned off Lawley Crescent and for much of the day residents were advised to stay inside. 

The woman in question has been detained and is assisting police with their enquiries.

The vehicle has now been taken away for testing as police continue investigations to determine the contents of the package.
