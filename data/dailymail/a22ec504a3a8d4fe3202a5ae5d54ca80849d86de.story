A woman tragically paralyzed during her own bachelorette party has announced she and her husband are expecting a girl, thanks to an old friend who agreed to carry her baby.

Rachelle Friedman, 28, said on her Facebook page she was 'so excited to meet our sweet princess' with the baby expected to be born in April. 

Mrs Friedman, who is quadriplegic, is being given a helping hand to have her by college friend Laurel Humes who will act as a surrogate.

Friend in need: Humes and Friedman knew one another in college and now Mrs Humes is going to carry Friedman's child for her

The delighted mother-to-be admitted she shed a few tears of happiness when she made the announcement and is starting to pick out baby names. Mrs Friedman had said previously she was hoping for a girl.

Mrs Friedman's life was dramatically altered in 2010 when she was paralysed after being pushed in a pool by one of her friends at her bachelorette party. 

Tragically, she fell too close to the shallow end of the pool and broke her neck.

After a year, Mrs Friedman tied the knot to fiance Chris Chapman and the pair were anxious to start a family, beginning a campaign to raise $60,000 to pay for a surrogate.

Their prayers were answered in June last year when Laurel Humes, 31, a friend of Mrs Friedman's from college, volunteered to carry Chris and Rachelle's child.

Overjoyed: Friedman's eggs were harvested and in July, the fertilized embryos were implanted in Humes

Doctors retrieved Friedman's eggs and transferred the fertilized embryos into Humes in July.

Soon after, Mrs Friedman shared a picture of herself, husband Chris and Mrs Humes and wrote: 'Crossing our fingers she's pregnant right now.'

The wait paid off, with Mrs Friedman announcing in August she was going to be a mother and posting a picture of her surrogate's scan.

'First family photo,' she wrote. 'We are going to have a baby!!' she wrote. 'Due date? April 19th. We are elated.'

'I never cry...ever. But I may have shed a few tears of happiness here!'

Mrs Friedman, who also shares on her blog babychapman.com, had been ecstatic when doctors told her after the catastrophic injury, she would be able to bear children. But her joy quickly turned to sorry when she discovered that medications she would be required to take her her blood pressure can be dangerous when pregnant.

The 28-year-old and her husband launched a crowdfunding campaign in May in a bid to raise money for the procedure, which can cost up to $120,000 a fetus.

Their prayers were unexpectedly answered just weeks after setting up their page. After reading a post on Friedman's blog about needing a surrogate, Humes, a stay-at-home mother of one, knew she wanted to help.

Mother-to-be: Rachelle Friedman and husband Chris Chapman, leave their 2011 wedding reception

Just weeks before her wedding, Mrs Friedman had been at her bachelorette party with her bridesmaids when one of her friends playfully pushed her in the pool, breaking her neck and leaving her paralyzed

Mr Chapman said:  'She said she'd already been 
looking into surrogacy and wanted to help us start a family.'

His overjoyed wife added: 'It's amazing, it wouldn't be possible without her. Surrogacy is astronomically expensive, it's crazy.' 

Despite her joy, Mrs Friedman admitted she had faced some discrimination after announcing she wanted children and said: 'A lot of 
people . . .  don't think someone in a wheelchair can be a mother, that 
I'm not physically able to take care of a kid but people underestimate 
my abilities.'

Hopes and dreams: 'I want a child more than anything,' she tweeted in May 

'I broke my neck upon impact, became paralyzed from the chest down and would never walk again,' she told xoJane.com. It took two-and-a-half months of intensive physical therapy for Friedman to rebuild her upper body strength and regain movement in her arms and fingers.

Instead
 of resenting her friend, however, Friedman chose to keep her name 
secret from the press, in order to prevent them from hounding her and 
making her feel guiltier than she already did.

'She
 is and will always be one of the my closest friends,' she stated, 
explaining that her decision to keep her friend's identity a secret is 
something she never once questioned.

'It's not our sisterly bond that keeps
 me from saying her name in interviews,' she wrote. 'It's the fact that 
she's a human being.'

Friedman also revealed that the friend who pushed her into the pool has been instrumental in her journey towards motherhood.

'I feel very grateful to have her support and love,' she wrote.

Friedman has published a book, The Promise: A Tragic Accident, a Paralyzed Bride, and the Power of Love, Loyalty, and Friendship , which delves into her life before and after she became paralyzed.
