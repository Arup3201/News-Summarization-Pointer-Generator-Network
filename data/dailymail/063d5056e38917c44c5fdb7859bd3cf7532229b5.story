Around 5,200 police and interior troops have been mobilised throughout Volgograd after two deadly attacks in less than 24 hours that raised 
security fears ahead of the Winter Olympics.

A suicide bomb at the city's railway station on Sunday has left 18 dead, and a bomb blast on a trolleybus on Monday saw 16 people killed.

Dozens of people in the Russian city were detained by police today as part of 'Operation Anti-terror Whirlwind',  according to
Interior Ministry spokesman Andrei Pilipchuk.

He
 said 87 people had been detained after they resisted police or could 
not produce proper ID or registration documents, and that some had 
weapons.

The bombings of the city's railway station, and a trolleybus, have raised security fears ahead of the Winter Olympics, which begin on February 7

State TV showed helmeted officers pushing men up against a 
wall. But there was no sign any were linked to the bombings or suspected
 of planning further attacks.

A man wounded when a bomber set off a
 blast in the city's railway station on Sunday died overnight.

Regional governor Sergei Bazhenov said 16 died in a trolleybus bombing on Monday.

There was no indication that any of those held was connected to the attacks.

Nobody
 has claimed responsibility for the blasts, but they underscored 
vulnerability to bombings and raised fears of attacks by Islamist 
insurgents whose leader has called on militants to prevent Russia 
hosting the Olympics in February.

The
 Itar-Tass news agency said police were focusing on migrant workers from
 the Caucasus and ex-Soviet states - groups that rights activists say 
face prejudice and are often targeted by police indiscriminately.

Investigators
 said they believed a male suicide bomber was responsible for Monday's 
morning rush-hour blast, which turned a trolleybus into a twisted wreck 
and left bodies lying in the street.

In
 Sunday's attack, authorities initially described the bomber as a woman 
from Dagestan, but later said the bomber may have been a man.

Citing
 unnamed sources, the Interfax news agency said the suspected attacker 
in Sunday's blast was an ethnic Russian convert to Islam who had moved 
to Dagestan and joined militants there early in 2012.

'I'm frightened,' said Tatyana Volchanskaya, a student in Volgograd, 700km (400miles) northwest of Sochi, the Black Sea resort where the Winter Games start on February 7.

She said some friends were afraid to go to shops and other crowded places.

Vladimir Putin today vowed the total destruction of terrorists in a hard-hitting New Year message.

'I am certain that we will fiercely and consistently continue the fight against terrorists until their complete annihilation', he said in his annual televised address at midnight. 

The strongman rewrote his New Year address even as the start of 2014 rolled across Russia's nine time zones. 

'We bow our heads before the victims of cruel terrorist acts,' he said in his revamped message which came on a day that funerals began for the bomb victims.  

His original address, heard by residents in the extreme east of Siberia, the first to see in the New Year, contained no reference to the bombings. 

Putin's new version was delivered from Khabarovsk - seven hours ahead of Moscow - in the Far East of Russia where he flew to celebrate the New Year with victims of summer flooding. 

'In the current year, we have encountered problems and have been challenged by serious experiences, including ones like the inhuman acts of terror in Volgograd,' he said. 

His spokesman said he 'broke a longstanding tradition' in ripping up his original message to deliver his uncompromising warning to Islamic extremists who are blamed for the Volgograd carnage. 

The attacks posed a challenge to President Vladimir Putin, who oversaw a war that drove rebels from power in Chechnya over a decade ago but has been unable to quell the Islamist insurgency that erupted in its wake.

Volgograd - formerly Stalingrad - is a city of about 1million and a transport hub for an area of southern Russia that includes Chechnya and the other mostly Muslim provinces of the North Caucasus, where the insurgency generates deadly violence almost every day.

A car bomb killed a prosecutor's assistant in Dagestan, a hub of Islamist militancy in the Caucasus, on Tuesday, and two people were killed in a bomb blast there late on Monday, authorities said.

Putin has staked his prestige on the Games in Sochi, which lies at the Western edge of the Caucasus Mountains and within the strip of land the insurgents want to carve out of Russia and turn into an Islamic State.

He ordered increased security nationwide after the attacks, the deadliest outside the North Caucasus since a suicide bomber from a province next to Chechnya killed 37 people at a Moscow airport in January 2011.

Volgograd was also the scene of an attack in October, when a woman from Dagestan killed seven people in a suicide bus blast.

The violence raised fears of a concerted campaign before the Olympics, an important project for Putin, who secured Russia's first post-Soviet Games in 2007, during his initial 2000-2008 stint as president.

Intended to showcase how Russia has changed since the collapse of Soviet communism in 1991, the Games have also been a focus for complaints in the West and among Russian liberals that Putin has stifled dissent and encouraged intolerance.

This month, Putin freed jailed opponents
 including oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the Pussy Riot punk band 
in what critics said was an effort to disarm Western criticism and 
improve his image.

In an online video posted in July, the Chechen leader of insurgents who want to carve an Islamic state out of mainly Muslim provinces south of Volgograd, urged militants to use 'maximum force' to prevent the Games from going ahead.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach condemned the 'despicable attack on innocent people' and said he had written to Putin to express condolences and confidence that Russia would deliver 'safe and secure games in Sochi'.

The U.S. government is concerned Islamist militants may be preparing attacks aimed at disrupting the Olympics and has offered closer co-operation with Russia on security.
