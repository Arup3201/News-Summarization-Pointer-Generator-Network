The father of a teenage girl who is believed to have been kidnapped by a man suspected of killing her mother has pleaded with the man - his friend - to hand over the girl and turn himself in.

Brett Anderson pleaded with suspect James DiMaggio to release his daughter Hannah, 16, adding: 'You've taken everything else.'

'Jim, I can't fathom what you were 
thinking,' he said at the news conference near San Diego, California on Tuesday. 'The damage is done.'

His daughter Hannah, 16, has not been seen since Sunday - when the murdered bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, 42, and a child were found in DiMaggio's burned home in Boulevard.

Hannah's eight-year-old brother, Ethan, is also missing - and authorities have suggested that the child's remains found in the wrecked house could belong to him, but they are waiting for DNA results.

Missing: Authorities have issued an Amber 
Alertfor Ethan Anderson, 8, and Hannah Anderson, 16, who vanished after their mother's body was found. Authorities suggested a second found body could belong to Ethan

At the press conference, Mr Anderson 
also pleaded with his missing daughter, who authorities believe is in 
grave danger, to run away from the family friend if she could.

'Hannah, we all love you very much,' he said. 'If you have a chance, you take it. You run. You’ll be found.'

Anderson
did not make reference to eight-year-old Ethan, who was named with his 
sister in an Amber Alert after the burned down home was found.

Mrs
Anderson's body was found near to a dead dog in the house and after 
authorities carried out further searches, the remains of a child
were also found among rubble in the garage.

Worry: Their father Brett Anderson pleaded for the return of his daughter on Tuesday as he appeared at a vigil - his face filled with worry. 'You've taken everything else,' he said to the suspect

An
autopsy was performed Tuesday, but authorities said it could still take
a few days for DNA testing to determine if the child was Ethan, Fox News reported.

'It is a 
possibility that it's Ethan,' said sheriff's Lt. Glenn Giannantonio. 
'Right now we just don't know. And we're praying that it isn't Ethan.'

The manner of the child's death remains undetermined but officials said that Ms 
Anderson had been murdered.

Dimaggio, 40, lived at the house alone. He is now wanted on suspicion of murder and arson.

Reports say that he was a close 
family friend and shared a platonic relationship with Mrs Anderson. It 
is believed the children treated him like an uncle.

Authorities
have not releasing a motive for the alleged crimes, but there has been 
speculation about a further relationship between he and Hannah, Fox 5 
reported.

Christina 
Anderson's father, Christopher Saincome, said he had seen DiMaggio two 
or three times and described him as a good friend of his son-in-law.

On
Tuesday, Mr Anderson joined hundreds of family friends and neighbors at
a candlelight vigil in the parking lot of El Capitan High School in 
Lakeside, where Hannah was about to start her junior year.

Pink
paper cups stuffed between holes in the fence read 'Pray Hannah' and 
dozens of white, blue and pink balloons lifted into the air.

At the vigil, Mr Anderson and other family members address the large crowd.

'Hannah
will come back and Ethan and Tina, I love you both,' he said. 'We all 
love you. I know everybody’s here for support of all three of them and I
want to thank you all. God bless.'

'You would never see her without a smile on her face, said Marlee Friszell, 16, who attended Hannah's birthday party last week.

Ethan Anderson liked to play football and baseball and go fishing, neighbors said.

The Amber Alert said DiMaggio is believed to be driving a blue Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986. 

The California Highway Patrol said the suspect could be headed to Texas or Canada.

'Realistically,
we don't know where they’re going,' Giannantonio told Fox 5.

'We're 
keeping a wide net, and hopefully we’ll find them. We're looking 
everywhere. We're going to work on this case until we find them.'

He
is described as white, 5 feet 9 inches tall, weighing 150 pounds, with 
brown hair and brown eyes, and is currently clean-shaved without the 
goatee beard seen in his photo.
