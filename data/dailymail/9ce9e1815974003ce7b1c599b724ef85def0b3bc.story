Two young woman who admitted stealing almost £800 worth of goods from John Lewis blamed the store's lax security for their crime.

Jodie Hastings, 25, and Natasha-Marie Fleming, 23, snatched scooters and hair straighteners worth nearly £800 from the store's flagship store in Oxford Street, central London.

The young mothers were snared when they returned to steal from the same shop again just a few days later. But the two thieves were recognised by security guards and arrested, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.

Jodie Hastings, of Regents Park, left, and Natasha-Marie Fleming, of Tottenham, right, told police that they targeted John Lewis because 'security at the store was so lax, and therefore tempting'

Hastings, wearing a black gilet over a grey jumper, and Fleming, dressed smartly in all black, spoke only to confirm their names and plead guilty to theft from a shop.

Prosecutor Birgitte Hagem said: 'In the police interview Ms Fleming said they decided they were going to steal because the security at the store was so lax, and was therefore tempting'.

District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe fined the pair £490 each for the March 27 theft and handed them each a 12-month conditional discharge.

She said: 'It would be nice that people should leave everything unguarded, doors open, cars unlocked and things were not stolen.

'The fact that people are not as security conscious as others is not a reason or excuse for stealing, and should not be a temptation'.

Fleming, of Regent's Park, northwest London, and Hastings, of Tottenham, north London, both admitted theft from a shop.
