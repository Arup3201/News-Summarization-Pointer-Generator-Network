Robin Williams was last seen alive by his wife Susan Schneider at around 10.30pm on Sunday, when she went to her room at their home in California, officials said

Alone and depressed, Robin Williams spent his final hours in a separate bedroom from his wife, it was revealed last night.

His body lay undiscovered for 12 hours after his suicide.

The actor was last seen alive by his wife Susan Schneider at around 10.30pm on Sunday, when she went to her room, officials said. They are believed to have been the only people in the house.

Miss Schneider left the mansion in Tiburon, north of San Francisco, at around 10.30am on Monday, thinking her husband was still asleep.

Williams was found by his personal assistant at around 11.45am after he failed to respond to knocks on his door.

Miss Schneider learned of his death only after emergency services, called by the assistant, pronounced the 63-year-old dead at 12.02pm.

She issued a touching tribute to her husband in a statement that said: ‘I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings.

‘I am utterly heartbroken. On behalf of Robin’s family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin’s death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.’ Revealing the results of a preliminary investigation, assistant chief deputy coroner Lieutenant Keith Boyd, from Marin County Sheriff’s Office, said the actor appeared to have died from asphyxia due to hanging.

‘It is unknown when Mr Williams retired for the evening in a bedroom at his home,’ said Mr Boyd, adding that initial tests showed the star had been dead for at least 12 hours. The body did not appear to have been moved after death and there were no signs of a struggle.

Mr Boyd said toxicology tests will be conducted to find out if Williams had any drugs or alcohol in his system when he died. He confirmed that Williams had been seeking treatment for depression, but would not discuss whether he left a suicide note. He emphasised that the investigation was still active and that an official cause of death would not be announced for several weeks.

The body has been released for the family to make funeral arrangements.

Meeting: Prince Charles met Robin Williams after a charity performance marking the Royal's 60th birthday in 2008

PRINCE CHARLESHe was a remarkable man, whose wonderful frenetic humour brought a special kind of laughter into people’s lives. I greatly enjoyed meeting him on several occasions and his irreplaceable contribution to life will be greatly missed.PRESIDENT OBAMARobin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor... and everything in between. But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien – but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit. He made us laugh. He made us cry. BILLY CONNOLLYRobin was both my friend and my hero, a unique talent and a kind and generous man; the world will be a much poorer place without him.

Asked whether Williams and his wife were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Mr Boyd said: ‘We’re not going into that part of the investigation. What I will say is that she retired to bed. Mr Williams’ wife retired prior to Mr Williams into a room in the home. It is not known at this time exactly when Mr Williams retired for the evening, but he went to a different room of the home.’

The actor’s two ex-wives have yet to speak about his death. His first marriage, to Valerie Velardi, collapsed in 1988 after he had an affair with cocktail waitress Michelle Tish Carter. Miss Carter sued him in 1986, claiming he did not tell her he was infected with the herpes virus, which he transmitted to her. The case was settled out of court.

In 1989 he married his son’s nanny, Marsha Garces, who was already pregnant. They split in March 2008. Williams was open about the effect his alcohol addiction had on his family relationships, and blamed his drinking for the break-up of his 19-year second marriage.

Although Williams spoke candidly about his drink and drugs problems in interviews, longtime friends said he always concealed his inner self

‘You know, I was shameful, and you do stuff that causes disgust, and that’s hard to recover from,’ he said. The comic used to be a binge-drinking cocaine addict early in his career, but quit after his friend John Belushi died from a heroin and cocaine overdose in 1982.

He remained sober for 20 years but started drinking again in 2003, leading to long stints in rehab.

Explaining his addiction to alcohol he once said: ‘It’s just literally being afraid. And you think, oh, this will ease the fear. And it doesn’t... It’s just a general all-round arggghhh! It’s fearfulness and anxiety.’Williams said a string of serious health problems and open heart surgery in 2009 helped him feel ‘mortal’ for the first time and turn his life around.

But he continued to struggle with depression and last month checked into a Minnesota rehab facility for help maintaining sobriety after a gruelling year and a half of work. Although he spoke candidly about his drink and drugs problems in interviews, longtime friends said he always concealed his inner self.
