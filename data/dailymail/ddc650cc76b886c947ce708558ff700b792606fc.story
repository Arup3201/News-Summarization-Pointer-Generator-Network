Tulisa has slammed former X Factor consultant Chris Herbert's apology over his part in her sex tape leak, saying his apology does not make up for the trauma the leak caused her.

Today Chris Herbert issued a grovelling apology to the star - and then pinned the blame solely on her ex.

The trusted executive lost his job after the X Factor judge accused him of being the middleman in her scandal, claiming that he played 'a pivotal role in commercial exploitation of the film'.

Herbert, who is currently facing legal proceeding over his part in the leak, said he was sorry and even alleges he advised Tulisa ex Justin Edwards not to try and cash in on the video.

Not the best ending: Chris Herbert, the man Tulisa is suing for his involvement in her sex tape scandal, has apologised for any part he may have paid in the sex tape saga

Speaking to The Sun on Sunday Herbert, who represented Edwards, explained he told his client he would be sued and said he never 'made a penny' from the leak.

In a grovelling apology he said: 'My reputation and business has been ruined by these unsavoury people. I never tried to make a penny.

'I was disgusted by the whole thing and from day one advised Justin not to do anything with the tape. I even got a lawyer to tell him he would be sued.'

But Tulisa hit back today, with her manager telling MailOnline: '‘If Chris Herbert were genuinely sorry, he would be saying nothing. 

'One ‘sorry’ does not make up for all the upset caused to Tulisa. This trauma to Tulisa was compounded by the defendants before admitting their lies, allowing claims this was a Tulisa publicity stunt which was 100 per cent never the case.

'Herbert is no longer involved in the X-Factor in any way as announced by X Factor. Simon Cowell had nothing to do with Herbert’s hiring.'

Although Herbert has been fired from X Factor he manages four-piece band JukeBoxx, with members Adam Wallis, Daecolm Diego, Jazz Rocket and Xorael Harrison, wowing the judges at the Manchester auditions.

They were later tipped as one of the favourites.

But it seems this is not enough for Herbert who wants Cowell to take him back on the show so he can explain everything in person.

But a friend of the Young singer has told The Sun earlier this week: 'It is fair to say there is no love lost between Tulisa and Chris. She won’t be happy at the news he still has involvement with the show.'

Continuing her pal added: 'But she is a pro and won’t allow this news to cloud her judgement.'

Victory: Tulisa outside the High Court two weeks ago - Chris Herbert has now apologised to the star for his part in the tape

The singer is now suing the Herbert who played a part in the success of bands such as the Spice Girls, 5ive and HearSay.

Herbert
was named as a defendant in the legal war over the tape, which was 
leaked by her ex earlier this year and was being sold for nearly £4 as a
download.

A spokesperson for The X Factor told MailOnline: 'Due to an ongoing legal dispute involving Tulisa Contostavlos and Chris Herbert, we decided it is in everyone's interest for Mr Herbert to not be involved in the forthcoming series on a music consultancy role.

'This however does not affect the positions of any act that have auditioned for the show that are represented by Chris.'

Two weeks ago Tulisa finally put her
sex tape scandal behind her when she settled her legal action against 
her ex-Justin Edwards after he admitted he was responsible for releasing
the clip.

But determined 
to get all those involved in the invasion of her privacy punished she 
hit out at Edwards' former manager and several other men.
