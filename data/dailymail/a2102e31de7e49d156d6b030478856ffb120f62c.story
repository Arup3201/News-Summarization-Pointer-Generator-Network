Gary Lineker has proven himself a safe pair of hands over the years, but the Match of the Day host was left scrambling after dropping a ball during the FA cup fifth round rehearsal draw on Monday.

Lineker fumbled the No 9 ball whilst practising the draw with The One Show host Alex Jones, but was able to laugh at the situation with his co-host and presenter Mark Chapman - who joked Lineker was the 'clumsiest man in the world'.

Luckily for the former England striker, the main draw passed without any problems. Although, there was a hairy moment when Lineker almost put a ball he had drawn out back into the main pot. Had he done so, it is understood the draw would have been voided and started again.

Lineker told The One Show afterwards: 'It was a hairy experience. It's a horrible feeling, I just wanted to put each ball back in the pot. I was genuinely a bit sweaty'

He later tweeted: 'I dropped a ball in rehearsals. This won't surprise people that know me, eh @daniellebux?'

The draw has seen current holders Arsenal land a potentially tricky home tie against Middlesbrough. Manchester United - should they see off Cambridge on Tuesday - will play away to either Preston North End or Sheffield United.

Alan Pardew's revitalised Crystal Palace will play either Liverpool or Bolton Wanderers at Selhurst Park and West Brom will play West Ham. 

The draw was live on BBC One and attracted 5.8million viewers.

Crystal Palace vs Liverpool or Bolton Wanderers

Bradford City vs Sunderland or Fulham

Blackburn Rovers vs Stoke City

Derby County vs Reading

Preston North End or Sheffield United vs Cambridge United or Manchester United

Ties will take place across the weekend of 14 and 15 February 2015.
