Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

In Italy, the papers are full of World Cup build-up ahead of the summer tournament's opening game between Brazil and Croatia on Thursday.

La Gazzetta dello Sport have turned their edition blue to get behind the Azzurri and spur Cesare Prandelli's side on ahead of their first match against England on Saturday.

'Let's beat them Azzurri' beams the Italians newspaper in bold blue font as Riccardo Montolivo tells fans to put their money on Ciro Immoible to help Italy into the competition's last four.

Corriere dello Sport lead with quotes 
from Brazilian superstar Neymar, who claims he isn't scared of the 
pressure he is under to deliver during the World Cup to the host nation.

'Too much pressure?' Neymar asks the Italian newspaper, 'I'm not scared.'

The Thursday edition also includes some rare quotes from Argentina and Barcelona star Lionel Messi who seems in a resilient mood ahead of the summer tournament.

The 26-year-old will no doubt be feeling the heat in Brazil as he is yet to convince the Argentine crowd, who believe Messi plays on a different level when with Barcelona.

However, Messi has claimed it's his time to help Argentina to World Cup glory and states he will win it for Diego Maradona.

Elsewhere in Italy, Tuttosport focus on Italy maestro Andrea Pirlo, who is set to retire from international football after the tournament in South America.

Pirlo also reveals that he could have signed for Tottenham, but instead will continue to pull the strings for Juventus for another year.

He said: 'I’ll sign it...(the Juventus deal). I could have gone to Tottenham, but I chose to stay because I want to continue to win. And not only the Scudetto.'

Belief: Spanish paper Marca (right) claims their La Roja are still the team to beat

The front pages in Spain are fully focused on the start of their national team's World Cup defence as Marca claims it's 'everyone against Spain.'

The Spanish paper also poins to why La Roja are still the team to beat this summer with 'defensive strength and just six six goals conceded in the last 19 matches.'

There's also bad news for Manchester United fans as new Barcelona boss Luis Enrique reveals that Red Devils target Pedro is in his plans for next season.

AS also report that it will be 'Spain against the world' over the next five weeks, but also look ahead to the World Cup opener between Brazil and Croatia which will include several La Liga stars.
