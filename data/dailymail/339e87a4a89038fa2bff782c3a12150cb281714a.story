Twenty people have been injured after a platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt at a circus performance in Providence, Rhode Island on Sunday, sending eight acrobats plummeting to the ground.

Nine performers were seriously injured in the fall, including a dancer below, while the remainder suffered minor injuries.

The accident was reported to police at about 11:45 a.m., 45 minutes into the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus' Legends show at the Dunkin' Donuts Center.

Performance gone wrong: An injured female performer is lifted onto a stretcher after a platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus in Providence

Eight performers remained hospitalized Monday after a platform collapsed during a performance by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Providence, Rhode Island on Sunday

Serious injuries: As many as 20 performers were hurt when the scaffolding collapsed, dropping them between 25 and 40 feet (8 and 12 meters) to the ground

Stephen 
Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, the parent company of 
Ringling Bros., said the accident happened during an act in which eight 
performers hang 'like a human chandelier' using their hair.

He
 said the metal-frame apparatus from which the performers were hanging 
came free from the metal truss it was connected to. The eight women fell
 25 to 40 feet, landing on a dancer on the ground.

All
 the performers have been doing ‘some variation of this act for some 
time,’ Payne said, though he didn't know how long. The current 
incarnation of the act began in January with the launch of the show, he 
said.

Providence
 Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare said officials and inspectors 
haven't yet determined what caused the accident. He said none of the 
injuries appears to be life-threatening.

Eleven people were admitted to hospital on Sunday after a platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt, sending eight acrobats plummeting to the ground

Rhode 
Island Hospital in Providence admitted 11 patients with varying 
injuries, including one in critical condition, spokeswoman Jill Reuter 
said.

 of the audience shows a curtain fall to reveal a platform from which 
the performers were suspended, then suddenly the platform crashes to the
 ground and a loud gasp of horror can be heard from the audience.

Sydney
 Bragg, 14, of North Kingstown, said the platform began to fall as it 
neared the rafters of the arena. At first, she said, she thought it was 
part of the act.

‘It
 just went crashing down,’ Sydney said. ‘Everyone was freaking out. We 
heard this huge clatter and then we just heard the girls scream.’

She said spotlights were on the performers at the time, but all the lights went out after the fall.

Rosa
 Viveiros of Seekonk, Massachusetts, said the act was covered by a 
curtain.

Shortly after the curtain was pulled away, she said, the 
performers fell on top of at least one other performer, a man who stood 
up with his face bloodied. The other performers remained still, she 
said.

‘We thought it was part of the circus,’ said Rosa Viveiros' husband, Joe.

'Everybody’s conscious. Everybody’s doing well. We ask 
everybody to pray for the girls,' said Roman Garcia, general manager of the touring circus, at a news conference.

Fire department rescue units from Providence, East Providence, and Smithfield were called to assisted with the injured. The circus performances were suspended after the accident and quickly canceled.

Officials later announced that the scheduled 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.
performances have been canceled.

Othello Smith of Providence said he took his young children out of the auditorium shortly after the accident.

‘One of the performers was crying,’ he told the Providence Journal. ‘It looked pretty bad.’

‘They just dropped,’ he said. ‘It happened so fast you didn’t really believe it happened.’

The circus had arrived in town on Friday and performances were scheduled through Monday, before it moves on to Hartford, CT.

Another witness reported seeing a 
performer being lifted onto a gurney and as they were being wheeled 
towards the rescue truck, they waved to the audience and members of the 
audience clapped.

The incident occurred during a part of the show at the Dunkin Donuts Center which featured a team of acrobats

A circus announcer told the audience that accidents can happen in live performances and thanked the first responders for there efforts.

The hair-hanging stunt is described on the circus' website as a ‘larger-than-life act’ featuring eight female performers.

‘These “hairialists” perform a combination of choreography and cut-ups including spinning, hanging from hoops, and rolling down wrapped silks, all while being suspended 35 feet in the air by their hair alone,’ the website says.

‘In this hair-raising act, audiences will even see the weight of three girls held aloft by the locks of only one of these tangled beauties.’
