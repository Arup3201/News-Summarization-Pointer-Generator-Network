A mother is facing up to eight years in jail for allegedly endangering her sick son's life by contaminating his IV line at a Cincinnati children's hospital.

Candida Fluty, 35, of Kermit, West Virginia, was apparently caught on camera as she took her nine-year-old son's colostomy bag and removed feces using a syringe.

She then injected the waste matter into the boy's intravenous drip, which reportedly caused his fever to spike.

Fluty's son suffers from a rare disease called Hirschprung's. The congenital condition, which affects muscle movement the bowels, has required numerous surgeries. 

However, it's thought his symptoms may have been exacerbated by Fluty, who's believed to be a perpetrator of Munchausen by proxy syndrome 

The psychological disorder is marked by attention-seeking behavior by a caregiver through those who are in their care. 

An indicator of her mental illness was apparently the fact that she openly wrote about her son's condition on Facebook. 

It's thought Fluty had performed the alleged IV-injecting stunt on previous occasions.
