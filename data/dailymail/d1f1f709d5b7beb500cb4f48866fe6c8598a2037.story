Silvio Berlusconi has claimed that prostitutes brought to his house by an associate, simply lifted his morale, and that he had no idea they were call girls.

The former Italian prime minister said that he believed the call girls, brought to his house in 2009 by businessman Giampaolo Tarantini, were his guest's friends, adding that if he had wanted to invite prostitutes he could easily do so.

He made the comments during an exchange with magistrate Pasquale Drago in May, the details of which were published by  Italy's newspapers on Sunday.

He claimed he had asked his butler to position the women opposite him in order 'to lift up my morale' and strongly denied that he had known they were prostitutes, the Telegraph reports.

Mr Berlusconi is currently facing investigation on suspicion of paying Mr Tarantini 500,000 euros to tell investigators that the Italian former prime minister had no idea the women he met were paid escorts.

Patrizia D'Addario has claimed she had sex with Berlusconi and that he knew she was a prostitute.

It comes as his 28-year-old girlfriend vowed she will 'marry him' in a fawning joint interview with him.

Brunette Francesca Pascale, who at 28 is 49 years younger than billionaire media tycoon Berlusconi, said that she had always wanted to marry him - even when she was just a little girl.

Miss Pascale has been at Berlusconi's side through several turbulent events this past year, including his conviction for sex with an underage prostitute, abuse of office and tax fraud, as well as his general election defeat seven months ago.

But that has not diminished her romantic feelings for him as she told the magazine: 'I was a little girl when I got it into my head that I wanted to marry him,' as she described how she had first met Berlusconi at a political rally in October 2006.

She said: 'I asked if I could leave him my telephone number, I even asked for his as well. He told me "You're very pushy."'

At the time Berlusconi was married to 
his second wife Veronica Lario and Miss Pascale described how she told 
her shocked parents she was in love with him: 'They said they admired 
him as well but they also said "He's old enough to be your father."'

But
 she continued to pursue him, even though he had told her: 'It's out of 
the question - you are too young,' adding curiously: 'I can't give you 
the future you deserve.'

Miss Pascale, who has appeared as a TV showgirl, stood by his side during his trial revolving around an under age prostitute he paid and who attended his infamous Bunga Bunga parties where aspiring models and wannabes were eager to perform seductive stripteases for him in a luxury villa near Milan.

She has strongly defended him and has cooed about how she loved his policies in previous interviews.

Miss Pascale told the magazine: 'Women were throwing themselves at him but he was going through a period of disillusionment and inability of showing true love for a woman.

'In his eyes I was deluded, a dreamer. It wasn't easy for me. I didn't go to those dinners (parties) because I would not have been able to contain myself.'

During the last few years of his period in office before he resigned in 2011, Miss Pascale was seen driving into his official residence in Rome and she was also pictured at his side at the San Siro stadium watching his beloved AC Milan football team with him.

She added: 'At first I would just satisfy myself by being close to him, to spend time with him, I had to bite my tongue but now love has taken me to the happiness I feel today. I sought him out, I courted him and I made him fall in love with me. I practically did everything and still do - all he has to do is say yes.'

Berlusconi was sentenced to seven years in prison in June for paying an under age prostitute, Karima El Mahroug, who attended his parties in Milan. He has denied the charges and is now appealing

In December of last year and while still officially married to Ms Lario, Berlusconi confirmed that he was seeing Miss Pascale who he described as 'beautiful on the inside and beautiful on the outside' and on Valentine's Day they were photographed kissing and cuddling at a Rome restaurant.

Twice married Berlusconi, who has two children from his first wife and three from his second, told Vanity Fair: 'In all of the painful moments during the last few years, Francesca has been by my side. She has gifted me joy, without asking for anything in return. She has given me the desire to believe in the sincere love of a woman.'

In June Berlusconi was given a seven year sentence for having sex with an underage prostitute and he is appealing the verdict insisting he is innocent of the charge. He has also been given four years for tax fraud.

He is said to be rehearsing a nationwide prime time TV appearance in which he will once again attack judges for deliberately targeting him and he will insist that he is going to continue his fight against them and stay in politics.
