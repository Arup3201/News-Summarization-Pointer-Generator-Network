Scores of passengers miraculously avoided death or injury today when a powerful earthquake rocked New Zealand and sent a two-ton eagle sculpture promoting The Hobbit movie crashing down at Wellington airport.

The 6.3 magniture earthquake rocked the centre of the country, damanging buildings and sending boulders rolling down hills up and down the country between Auckland in the north and Dunedin on the tip of the south island.

The shudder was felt throughout most of the country but there were no immediate reports of serious injury or death.

Officials described the earthquake, 99 miles north-east of Wellington at a depth of 31 miles, as 'severe'.

Walls fell and huge rocks rolled across roads during the one-minute-long earthquake - and authorities warned that a number of aftershocks were likely to follow with more damage expected.

Most of the damage is believed to be in the Palmerston North area, north east of Wellington.

Fires broke out, telephone lines and power poles came down and alarm bells sounding in numerous towns.

Police inspector Mike Coleman, at the Wellington central command, said that windows had been smashed and crockery had been thrown around - 'the usual sort of movement with earthquakes.'

Wellington Free Abulance service said that while there were no immediate call-outs to attend injuries, the service had gone into emergency management mode as a precaution

Karen Monk, who lives on a farm just north of the town of Masterton, told the New Zealand Herald that the quake was 'really violent'.

She added: 'My baby daughter was in her cot asleep and I managed to leap across the hall and grab her and leap outside onto the lawn.'

Ms Monk and the baby remained outside for about half an hour while aftershocks rolled through.

Pam Lochore, wife of former All Black star Sir Brian Lochore, said photographs have tumbled from shelves in their Masterton home.

The earthquake had also caused water in the pool to 'rock side to side' and a 'rugby ball went flying across the room.'

One resident of Raumati South, Ms Leigh Nichols, described the earthquake as 'like a train going along the track. It was so noisy, everything was just rattling.'

Office staff were evacuated from buildings and motorists were urged to drive with care in case roads had subsided or debris had spilled across roads.

Reports later said that houses had suffered collapsed walls, fallen chimneys and broken windows in Ektahuna.

Earthquakes are not uncommon in New Zealand, the worst in recent times being the Christchurch disaster of February 2011 which brought buildings crashing down in the city centre, killing 185 people.
