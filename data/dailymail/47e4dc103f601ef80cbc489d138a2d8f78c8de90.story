Fox News television panelist Eric Bolling asked if a female fighter pilot may be called 'boobs on the ground,' in a joke that viewers have condemned as sexist.

Bolling made the remark in the Wednesday broadcast of 'The Five' during a segment on Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, who launched bombs against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Panelist Kimberly Guilfoyle's segment praised Mansouri for her efforts.  

'Hey ISIS, you were bombed by a woman,' Guilfoyle said. 'Oh yeah, hell came down on ISIS in Syria, because guess what: the first female pilot piloting for the [United Arab Emirates], there she was, leading the strikes. Dropped the bombs on ISIS Monday night.'

Pilot: Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri reportedly led the bomb attack on ISIS 

'This is really incredible,' Guilfoyle continued. 'Major Mariam Al Mansouri is who did this. Remarkable, very excited. I wish it was an American pilot. I'll take a woman doing this any day to them.

'I hope that hurt extra bad from you because in some Arab countries, women can't even drive. Her nickname, per Jennifer Griffin? "Lady Liberty," baby.'

Guilfoyle's co-panelist Greg Gutfield then remarked 'Problem is, after she bombed it she couldn't park it.'

Upset, Guilfoyle was heard saying 'Now did you really have to ruin my -' 

Andrea Tantaro, the other female panelist on 'The Five,' said 'Oh...' and left her mouth agape. 

'I salute her,' Gutfield maintained.

Eric Bolling then asked 'Would that be considered boobs on the ground, or no?'

With her hand over her face, Guilfoyle said 'Oh my God. Why are they are ruining my thing?'

'Did you just say what I thought you said?' Bob Beckel asked as the hosts spoke over one another.

Fox News anchor Greta van Susteren aired the conversation between the panelists from 'The Five' during her own self-titled program on Wednesday.

'Oh man,' she said. 'Do you think the gents on "The Five," minus Bob, should get a do-over on that one? They're going to get in so much trouble for that one.'

Viewers have indeed expressed their anger over Bolling's remarks, calling it 'Crazy sexism!' and 'Disrespectful and disgusting' on Twitter.

Another wrote '@FoxNews has a serious issue w disrespecting women. Boobs on the ground? You're an a******. On the ground. #waronwomen #feminism #sexism.'

'@ericbolling sorry to hear your remark about the female pilot and referencing Boobs on the ground! Thought you were smarter than that,' one tweet said.

Long wait: Al Mansouri has said she 'had to wait almost ten years' to realize her dream of being a fighter pilot

Other comments criticized Gutfield, as well.

'Fox anchors ruin story about female pilot with "boobs on the ground" and "she couldn't park" jokes #everydaysexism,' one comment read.

Another said '@ericbolling Dude, boobs on the ground? WTF? @greggutfeld et tu brute.'

However, some Twitter users enjoyed Bolling's comment.

'"Boobs on the ground." Hilarious! Love that WOMAN from UAE was the lead fighter pilot on the ISIS bombing! Cool!' a message said.

'@ericbolling Boobs on the ground = Priceless! It's clear you'll be taking major guff, My Brother. Ignore it,' said another.

Al Mansouri told CNN earlier this summer she wanted to pilot 'directly after I finished my high school.'

'I put up my mind to be a fighter pilot,' she continued. 'But at that time, the doors were not open for females to be pilots, so I had to wait almost ten years.'

Al Mansouri also said that 'Whenever a woman enters a new male-dominated field, they find the same hesitation, the same prejudice, the same stereotype thinking.

'And I had to prove myself by just being determined and having that skill and the knowledge enough to prove that I can perform as skillful as the men in this field.'
