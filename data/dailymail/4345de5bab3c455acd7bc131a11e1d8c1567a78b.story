A mother has spoken of her anger as police continue to hold on to her teenage daughter's remains - more than one year after her body was found.

Hailey Darlene Dunn, 13, went missing from her home in Colorado City, West Texas, in December 2010.

Her remains were discovered in March 2013 - more than two years later - near a lake about 20 miles away.

Victim: Hailey Darlene Dunn, 13, disappeared from her home in Colorado City, West Texas, in December 2010

No arrests have yet been made, while the cheerleader's remains are still being held by police.

Now, Hailey's mother, Billie Jean Dunn, has said she is going through 'pure hell' as she waits for officers to release what is left of her daughter's body.

'[It's] hell, just pure hell,' the 37-year-old told The Huffington Post.

'At first I didnâ€™t want to push for her remains back because I 
wanted them to get every bit of evidence they needed, but it has been a 
year and we want her home.'

Discovery: Hailey's remains were discovered in March 2013 - more than two years later - near Lake Thomas (pictured) in Scurry County. No arrests have yet been made and the remains are still being held by police

Ms Dunn reported her daughter missing from her home, about 250 miles west of Dallas, on the morning of December 28, 2010.

The Colorado City Middle School student's remains were found on March 16, 2013 - more than two years later - near Lake Thomas in Scurry County.

They were positively identified through DNA as belonging to the teenager - and since then, have reportedly been held in an evidence locker at the University of North Texas.

One month after Hailey's disappearance, Ms Dunn's then-boyfriend, Shawn Adkins was named a person of interest by police.

Arrest: Ms Dun, pictured at Mitchell County Sheriff's Office, was arrested by police in March 2011 after falsely telling officers that her then-boyfriend, Shawn Adkins, had been at her home on the night of December 27. She later pleaded no contest to a charge of making a false report and was sentenced to one year's probation

He allegedly told officers the teenager had spent 
the night of December 27 with a friend - only for that friend to later 
uncover his remarks as false.

He also reportedly failed a polygraph test and gave inconsistencies to police in statements about his job and whereabouts on the night in question.

However, Adkins, who split from Ms Dunn in 2012, has continued to deny any involvement in Hailey's disappearance or murder and has never been charged.

Ms Dunn herself was arrested by police in March 2011 and charged with falsely telling officers that her boyfriend had
 been at her home on December 27.

Grieving: The investigation into her 13-year-old daughter's death is believed to be active and ongoing

She later pleaded no contest to a charge of making a false report to authorities and was sentenced to one year's probation, according to local media reports.

Meanwhile, other charges against her, including those of misdemeanor, hindering prosecution and possessing a dangerous drug, were dropped as part of a plea agreement.

Today, Ms Dunn said the past 12 months had been 'very hard' to deal with - particularly because of the lack of suspects or arrests.

'It is hard waking up in the morning when the first thing you think is, "we
 don't have our daughter anymore", and then going to sleep at night and 
having it be the last thing on your mind,' she said.

She
 added that she 'won't have full closure' until arrests are made - and 
plans to cremate Hailey's remains once they are turned over to the 
family.

'I am very disappointed. It has been a whole year and nothing has changed,' she said.

Ms Dunn said she had launched a petition urging Scurry County Sheriff, Trey Wilson, to call for a review of both the case and the release of Hailey's remains.

The investigation into Hailey's death is active and ongoing.
