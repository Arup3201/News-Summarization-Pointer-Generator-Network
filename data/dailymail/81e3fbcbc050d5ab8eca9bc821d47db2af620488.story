According to the assistant district attorney, the couple got into an argument over some texts while at Hutton's parent's house. His parents were out of town, reports WECT6.

Also present was Connaway's friend, Claudene Williams, who said Hutton was angry because of some tangled fishing lines.

‘He was angry because he couldn't untangle fishing lines,’ explained Williams.

‘He was blaming her (Hannah) for some things like having snarky remarks to things he was saying, and then it just escalated and kept on going.’

The fight started inside the home and ended in the front yard. Williams said Hutton had beaten, strangled, and dragged Connaway across the yard.

‘I keep on hearing her screaming and I keep on hearing all the sounds and it's just awful. I ran around the front door. I tried to get in. All the doors were locked. It was just awful,’ Williams said.

When emergency responders arrived on scene they found Connaway unconscious in the front yard.

‘She's bleeding and on the ground. She can't walk,’ a caller told a 911 operator late Friday night. ‘It's her boyfriend, and he's threatening and screaming at us to get back in the car, so I just need someone to be there.’

Connaway was immediately taken to New Hanover Regional Medical Center for emergency brain surgery.

Hutton was originally arrested on Saturday night for assault to inflict serious injury and assault on a female charges, but bonded out on Monday. 

Connaway had updated her Facebook status on March 15 to announce that she was in a relationship with Hutton

He was taken back into custody following Tuesday’s court appearance. He is facing life without parole in relation to the attempted murder charge.

He is also facing close to 30 years for felony assault by strangulation and first degree kidnapping, felony assault to inflict serious injury, misdemeanor assault on a female, and a misdemeanor drug charge. His bond was set at $1 million.

Connaway’s condition was upgraded from critical to fair on Wednesday. She has opened her eyes and is communicating with friends and family.

Her grandmother Cynthia Strickland describes Hannah as a brilliant, beautiful, and caring young girl who loved people. She said Hannah was aware of Hutton's mental instabilities.
