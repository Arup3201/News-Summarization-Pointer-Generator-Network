A married father murdered a mother-of-two in her apartment before stealing her credit cards and using her car in a hit-and-run, police have said.

Lyle Robert London, 38, has been arrested in the murder of Lindsay Brown Holbrook, a 32-year-old divorced mom he knew. She was found dead in her Washington Terrace, Utah home on Friday night.

Sheriff's deputies had gone to the apartment after her car was involved in a hit-and-run, but when she failed to answer her door, they entered the home and found her desecrated body inside.

She had suffered an apparent trauma but the cause of her death remains under investigation. Her body could have been there for a few days, Fox13 reported.

Through evidence found in her car and witness accounts, police determined that London had been behind the wheel at the scene of the crash earlier that evening.

Authorities say he knew his alleged victim, but would not detail how - only calling them 'associates'.

Arrested: London's wife Shuree, 35, has also been arrested on suspicion of obstruction of justice

'It is believed that he murdered her in her apartment and then tried to conceal the crime,' Weber County Sheriff's Lt. Lane Findlay said in a press release.

Although police have not released a motive for the killing, after murdering the woman, London then took her financial cards and completed several fraudulent transactions, Findlay added.

He was then involved in the hit-and-run accident near 3000 Washington Boulevard, police believe.

A neighbor added to Fox13 that they had seen London going in and out of Holbrook's home in the days before her body was found. 

London was arrested at his Ogden home on suspicion of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, abuse and desecration of a human body, and unlawful possession and use of a financial card.

His wife, 35-year-old Shuree Laness London, was also arrested at a nearby hotel on suspicion of obstruction of justice. 

She allegedly 'had knowledge of this crime and assisted Mr. London after the fact,' Findlay said in the press release.

Both are being held in the Weber County jail.

Their Facebook profiles show they have been married for 13 years and have several children together - but Mrs London wrote on February 20 that they were having marital problems.

'I can honestly say we are going through a VERY VERY DIFFICULT time right now,' she wrote on her husband's profile.

Shortly afterwards, she posted a message reading, 'A real relationship is where you can tell each other everything & anything. No secrets, no lies,' adding: 'I worked so hard for nothing.' 

Court records show that Lyle London has pleaded guilty to several misdemeanor charges since 1999, including possession of drug paraphernalia, intoxication, simple assault, criminal mischief, theft and various traffic violations, the Deseret News reported.

His wife pleaded guilty to theft in 2010, as well as several traffic violations.

In light of the most recent charges, their friend John Cleveland told Fox13: 'Knowing him and knowing his background that would not surprise me at all.' 

He added that he had heard London mention Holbrook's name.

Facebook shows Holbrook was a mother to two young children, a boy and a girl. Fox13 reported that she was divorced from her husband and that it did not appear the children lived with her.

Scene: Her body was found in her first-floor apartment, left, by sheriff's deputies just before midnight on Friday. Authorities have said she apparently suffered trauma but have not yet said how she died

Her family released a statement through the sheriff's office on Sunday afternoon.

'Lindsay was a loving mother, amazing aunt, wonderful sister, and she had an incredible sense of humor,' it said. 'She is loved by a lot of people and will be greatly missed.'

An obituary shows that Holbrook's family also lost her younger brother, 27-year-old Nathan Brown, in January 2014. She leaves behind four other siblings.

The family has asked for privacy as they grieve and make preparations for her funeral.

'Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to them,' the sheriff's office said.
