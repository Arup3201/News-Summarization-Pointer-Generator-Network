Hundreds of people have braved snowy weather and blustery conditions to recreate one of the biggest and bloodiest battles of the Second World War.

American and Belgian nationals gathered in the Ardennes region of Belgium yesterday to mark the 70th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, one of the U.S. Army's bloodiest encounters with Nazi forces.

People young and old donned period U.S. Army uniforms for the re-enactment of the battle, which was fought for nearly six weeks from December 16, 1944.

The battle was one of the U.S. Army's bloodiest encounters with Nazi force and one of the greatest tank battles in American military history

A U.S. M36 Jackson tank destroyer was also used for the 70th anniversary commemoration, which went ahead despite the snowy conditions

The re-enactment was put on to remember more than 100,000 casualties who died or were wounded in the Ardennes counter-offensive

Military vehicles were also used for the re-enactment of one of the greatest tank battles in military history, including a German Jagpanther tank destroyer and a U.S. M36 Jackson tank destroyer.

Jean-Claude Klepper, 62, of Virton, Belgium, and his 15-year-old daughter Aurelie, dressed up like Second World War soldiers to mark the occasion.

Mr Klepper told Associated Press: 'We must never forget what happened in 1944. Many American soldiers came here to defend Europe. We must honour them for what they did.'

Stephen Sams, 41, a U.S. soldier based in Germany, said for him the battle waged in the dense forests and narrow valleys of Belgium and neighbouring Luxembourg epitomised 'the unwillingness of American forces to give up in the face of adversity.'

Starting on December 16, 1944, more than 600,000 American soldiers, fighting in freezing conditions, took part in desperate efforts to contain, then throw back, a surprise German counter-offensive masterminded by Adolf Hitler.

Total Allied casualties of the battle are estimated at 110,000 - making it the bloodiest battle for American troops in all of the Second World War

In total, there were 80,987 U.S. casualties, including 10,276 who died, 47,493 who were wounded and 23,218 who went missing during the battle

The total number of German casualties is estimated at 81,834 people, including 12,652 who died and 30,582 who were reported missing

In the final months of 1944 and keen to take control of the crucial port of Antwerp, Hitler launched one of the Nazis' bloodiest offensives on the West.

Taking U.S. forces by surprise, tens of thousands of German troops descended on Ardennes - a heavily forested region stretching through Luxembourg and Belgium.

Thick winter fog plagued the Allied forces' efforts to destroy German strongholds, and with Nazi troops donning U.S. Army uniforms to sabotage communications between divisions by snapping phone lines, victory was unlikely.

However, after depleting the German's armored tanks and resources, Western Allied forces triumphed.  

Total Allied casualties are estimated at 110,000 - making it the bloodiest battle for American troops in all of the Second World War. 

At the time, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill hailed the ultimate result as 'an ever-famous American victory.'

But it came at a high cost, with the total number of Allied casualties estimated to be 110,000 - making it the bloodiest battle for American troops in all of the Second World War.

In total, there were 80,987 U.S. casualties, including 10,276 who died, 47,493 who were wounded and 23,218 who went missing, according to the U.S. Army's official history.

The total number of German casualties is estimated at 81,834 people, including 12,652 who died and 30,582 who were reported missing. 

After the battle ended on January 25, 1945, Allied forces attacked Germany in unison, eventually leading to the Nazi surrender and the end of Second World War in Europe.

In the town of Bastogne, where soldiers of the 101th airborne held out despite being cut off and surrounded, shops and windows were decorated yesterday with American and Belgian flags.

One local restaurant displayed a drawing of an American flag and the message 'thank you.'

The country's King Philippe and his wife, Queen Mathilde, threw nuts into crowds of revellers as veterans were pushed in wheelchairs through the streets of the southern Belgium province.

The commemorations paid tribute to the American divisions which tirelessly defended the 70-mile stretch of woodland in the 1944 battle, known for having been fought under thick, cold mist.

Dressed in black, the Belgian royal family braved blizzards and freezing temperatures to lay wreaths at the McAuliffe monument in Bastogne, named after the American general who spearheaded the ferocious defence.

King Philippe also greeted veterans who took part in the courageous battle who had travelled to Bastogne for the festivities.
