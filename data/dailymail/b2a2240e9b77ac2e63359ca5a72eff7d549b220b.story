Wreckless: Ben Thomas was more than twice over the alcohol limit and had taken cocaine before he got behind the wheel last October

A driver who killed his three friends in a horrific car crash while he was high on drink and drugs has been jailed for nine years.

Ben Thomas, 26, was the only survivor in the smash after he lost control and careered into a tree while travelling at 73mph.

He was double the legal alcohol limit when his MG ZR flew off the Bristol Road in Birmingham in the early hours of October 21 last year.

His friend James MacDonald and cousin James Wassell, both 24, suffered serious injuries and died instantly at the scene.

A third passenger, Thomas’ other cousin David Wassell, 26, was taken to hospital with critical injuries but died in the early hours the following morning.

Thomas, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to three counts of death by dangerous driving, three counts of death by no insurance and one count of excess alcohol at an earlier hearing.

Today he was jailed him for nine years by Judge William Davis QC at Birmingham Crown Court.

He was also banned from driving for 10 years.

The court heard he had traces of cocaine in his system after the smash - which happened on a wet road in thick fog.

Collision investigators concluded that the ‘slowing speed’ of Thomas’ car was 73mph at the time it hit the tree.

Speaking after the case, PC Damian Gibson, from West Midlands Police, said: 'This case highlights the deadly combination of drink, drugs, excess speed and hazardous driving conditions.

'The crash happened on a damp road in thick fog and as well as being twice the alcohol limit, traces of cocaine were found in Thomas’ system.

'He had complete disregard for his own safety as well as the welfare of his friends, which has resulted in the needless loss of three young lives.'
