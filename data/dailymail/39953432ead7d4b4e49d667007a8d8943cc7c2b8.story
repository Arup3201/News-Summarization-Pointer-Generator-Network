There have been a host of big-money signings arriving in the Premier League for the top teams this summer with Alexis Sanchez, Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas just to name a few.

But there has also been shrewd business done from the likes of Stoke, Swansea and QPR, sides that will all be looking towards the top half of the table.

Below is the top ten players that could take the Premier League by storm this season.

 Remy Cabella

Club: Newcastle.

Joined from: Montpellier.

Cost: £12m.

Early evidence suggests Cabella is the class act Newcastle hoped they were getting. He's scored twice this summer and has already excited fans with his array of tricks. 

But the 23-year-old marries graft to his craft and the France international promises to be a fan favourite on Tyneside. He operates in the territory just behind a frontman but drifts across the park picking passes. 

He also boasts a thunderous right boot for a player who is slight of frame and is a deadball specialist.

Technical: Cabella is widely regarded as a deadball specialist in the game

Bafetimbi Gomis

Club: Swansea.

Joined from: Lyon.

Cost: Free.

Swansea bid £8million for him only last summer and view this signing as a major coup. 

Newcastle wanted to sign the French striker, who scored 102 Ligue 1 goals in 309 games, but he snubbed them for a move to Wales. The 29-year-old scored twice in pre-season and is expected to form an exciting partnership with Wilfried Bony, assuming Swansea keep the Ivorian. 

Technically, Gomis is a powerful and moderately quick striker who has an excellent finish and is good in the air. He is likely to play up front in a new 4-4-2 formation, or ahead of Gylfi Sigurdsson and alongside Bony in a 4-3-3.

Powerful: Gomis has already impressed for new side Swansea during pre-season

Muhamed Besic

Club: Everton

Joined from: Ferencvaros

Cost: £4million

Made an immediate impact in his first appearance in Leon Osman's testimonial, catching the eye with the ferocity of his tackling. 

Such has been the way he has settled in, manager Roberto Martinez said it seems as if he has been at Goodison Park for 'three years'. 

It will take time for him to adjust to the Premier League and he does have Gareth Barry and James McCarthy to get past in the battle for a midfield place but it is worth remembering Martinez opted for Besic rather than pursuing a move for Jack Rodwell. Will provide energy and bite as Everton compete on four fronts.

Talented: Besic has already been praised by his manager for how quickly he has settled into life at Everton

Dusan Tadic

Club: Southampton

Joined from: FC Twente

Cost: £10.9m

The Serbian has arrived in the Barclays Premier League as a virtual no-one, but the fact Ronald Koeman made his signing one of his acts as Southampton manager tells you how highly he is thought of by his new manager. 

The left-footed forward cultivated a reputation in Holland during his time with Gronigen and more recently FC Twente as a flamboyant and tricky winger. 

But it is Tadic's strike rate that will catch the eye. He has scored 32 goals from left-wing over the previous two seasons in Holland. 

The Saints may have just found themselves a player with the X-factor to help them forget about the summer's mass exodus.

Prolific: Tadic has scored 32 goals from the left-wing during the past two seasons in Holland

Mauricio Isla

Club: QPR

Joined from: Juventus

Cost: Loan

Harry Redknapp may have struck gold in the transfer market yet again with the capture of Isla. 

The right-back was a star of Chile's exciting World Cup campaign that ended with that heartbreaking penalty shoot-out defeat to Brazil. 

His boundless energy up and down Chile's right side was a feature of the South American's play earlier this summer, and with Redknapp planning to switch to a 3-5-2 formation next season, Isla's engine will be vital for QPR as they look to consolidate their top-flight status.

Quality: Isla was a stand-out performer at the World Cup for quarter-finalists Chile

Bojan Krkic

Club: Stoke

Joined from: Barcelona

Cost: £3m

Mark Hughes has secured quite a coup in signing this graduate of La Masia. Krkic, a forward or winger, broke into the Barca first team aged 17 and won three Liga titles and two Champions League crowns before his star faded.

Now 23, he remains a beguiling presence on the ball, two-footed, capable of drag-backs and dribbles, but has been criticised for not finding the net often enough, scoring just four in 24 games as he won the Eredivisie on loan at Ajax last season.

For Barca, he got 41 in 162 games. But he has three pre-season goals for Stoke and should be given a prominent role.

Back on track? Bojan could prove to be the signing of the summer after signing for Stoke

Brown Ideye

Club: West Brom

Joined from: Dynamo Kiev

Cost: £10m

That head coach Alan Irvine admitted he had never seen the Nigerian international striker play should not unduly worry supporters. Albion's set up leaves recruitment predominantly to the hierarchy and the 25-year-old was scouted extensively. 

He is a physical presence up front and comes with a good record of 33 goals in 74 matches for Kiev in the Ukrainian top-flight.

He might take a while to reach peak match fitness having surprisingly missed out on the Nigerian World Cup squad and failing to appear in pre-season as wrangles over his work permit were ironed out.

Presence: Ideye could prove to be a key player for West Brom this season

Leonardo Ulloa

Club: Leicester

Joined from: Brighton

Cost: £7m

Nigel Pearson long identified his striking options as needing fresh impetus and tracked Ulloa all summer before the clubs eventually struck a price. 

The 6ft 3in Argentine cost Leicester a club-record fee and will provide a muscular focal point for attacks, an aerial threat, and be a willing runner in behind defences. 

He scored twice against Leicester in a 4-1 victory for Brighton that seemed to cement Pearson's pursuit. 

Question marks arise because Ulloa has never played in the Premier League while only one of three seasons at Almeria was in La Liga. He grabbed his first two Leicester goals in a pre-season victory over Rotherham.

Step-up? Ulloa scored 16 goals for Championship side Brighton last season

Aly Cissokho

Club: Aston Villa

Joined from: Valencia

Cost: £2m

Experience has been the byword for Paul Lambert this summer and in Cissoko the Villa manager has that. At 26, the athletic left-back has already played in leagues in Portugal, France and Spain and spent last season on loan at Liverpool.

It is fair to say he was not a favourite at Anfield, appearing just 19 times, as Jon Flanagan converted from the right to get in ahead. 

Nonetheless, Cissokho does have plenty of attributes needed by Villa, including power, pace and strength. He has one French cap from 2010 and cost Lyon £12m from Porto in 2009.

All smiles: Cissoko will be hoping to hit some form for Aston Villa after a lacklustre spell at Liverpool

Cheikhou Kouyate

Club: West Ham

Joined from: Anderlecht

Cost: £7m

Very leggy, athletic but strong and he makes penetrating forward runs off the ball and seems to be all over the pitch. Imagine Patrick Vieira – and, on first look, he's a bit like that. 

West Ham will be very happy if he's anything like that when the season kicks off! Plays with his head up, likes to open his body and run at opponents.

He's not the finished article and, when he becomes that player, he might not be at West Ham for that much longer. 

Enjoy him while he is there and the West Ham crowd took to him against Sampdoria at the weekend. There was even a Senegalese flag around the ground and he responded as the best player on the pitch. Now for Spurs next week…

Athletic: Kouyate was very impressive for West Ham when they played Sampdoria at the weekend
