Iraq captain Younis Mahmoud squandered the chance of levelling the score against Iran in an Asia Cup warm-up match by putting his Panenka penalty effort over the bar.

The Lions of Mesopotamia fell 1-0 behind to an experimental Iranian side in the 55th minute after Russia-based striker Sardar Azmoun swiftly nipped past the defender and poked home.

The 2007 Asian champions had a fantastic opportunity to score an equaliser however Mahmoud tried to be far too clever for his own good.
