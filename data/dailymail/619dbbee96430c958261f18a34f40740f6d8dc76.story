Manchester United have been criticised for their inept defending this season, but have put in a number of exciting attacking performances - and midfielder Juan Mata may have found a solution to the problem.

The 26-year-old has named his dream five-a-side United team, which includes no defenders and plays to the strengths of Louis van Gaal's side by featuring only attackers.

There isn't even room for goalkeeper David de Gea.

Juan Mata was asked by a fan on Facebook to pick his dream Manchester United five-a-side team

The Spanish playmaker went for an attacking line-up and picked no defenders or goalkepeers 

Robin van Persie, who scored United's equaliser against Chelsea on Sunday, made the cut 

Argentine midfielder Angel di Maria was also selected as Mata went for an all-out attack approach

Mata was taking part in a Facebook Q&A with fans, and was asked, 'Which team-mates would you pick alongside you in a five-a-side team?'

The former Chelsea playmaker responded: 'I don't want to be unfair on everyone else but I would definitely pick an offensive team. 

'So it would be me, Wazza [Rooney], Robin [van Persie], Radamel [Falcao] and Angel [di Maria]. Ander [Herrera] will be angry with me but I don't mind! [Laughs]' 

There's no doubting the offensive potential of Mata's team, in fact they'd probably score so many goals that the lack of a keeper would barely matter. 

Van Gaal must wish he could solve his team's problems so easily.
