Behind the doors of a modest industrial unit in Brentford lies one of the world’s most advanced sports-science laboratories. Rory McIlroy, Amir Khan and David Weir have all been pushed to their limits in the space-aged facility and this summer Harlequins have been using the technology to enhance their preparations for the new season.

There is no expense spared. Funded by GlaxoSmithKline, a team of technicians help elite athletes fine-tune their craft and, in return, use the data to develop their own products. The resources on offer are beyond the financial boundaries of most professional sports teams; here they do not bat an eyelid at spending £80,000 on a single running machine.

The equipment is all state-of-the-art. There are pools that generate currents to replicate an Olympic 50metre freestyle final, treadmills so powerful they require three-foot deep foundations and atmospheric chambers that can recreate conditions ranging from the Antarctic to the sub-Saharan.

Cognitive: Harlequins have spent the off-season trying to improve decision-making in a Brentford laboratory

Thought process: Harlequins want to make the right decisions at the right time on the pitch this season

From a sporting perspective, it is all about marginal gains in performance. Intensive testing is carried out and the results can be used throughout the season to help determine optimum procedures.

Cognition is one of the six pillars of expertise and Harlequins have been working closely with the scientists to develop a brain-tuning tool. Director of rugby Conor O’Shea flew out to America this summer, where he spent time with the Philadelphia Eagles, the East Division NFL team, who are already using similar technology. It is designed to improve decision-making and O’Shea is hoping the project will help maximise the training hours spent with his squad.

‘You get less and less time with players on pitch,’ said O’Shea. ‘The hits are getting bigger and bigger, so how much contact work can you do in training? Three Test matches against the All Blacks at the end of a long season - good or bad idea? We need to make sure that we don’t get to a stage where the players are so tired that they become disposed to an injury.

‘That’s where you need to bring in things like the cognitive tool. There are always players out injured – that’s a fact, it’s a collision sport. Sometimes they don’t make any decisions for months on end, because they don’t play. We’re hoping that through technology our guys can keep working on their decisions even when they’re not playing. I’m not a scientist in any way shape or form, but it makes sense. Over in Philadelphia, even the coaches were doing it. We knew they were the one club that used the technology and they were really open to us. It’s about firing the brain.‘

Sports science is constantly spreading its influence over elite sport and Harlequins are developing their intelligence inside a darkened room at the Brentford HQ. The west London club suffered from well-documented injury problems last season but the new technology will not just be reserved for those battling with fitness problems. It can help identify individual strengths and weaknesses, as well as adjusting for jet-lag, hydration, stress and other factors.

‘By separating the brain training from the physical training, you can accumulate all that practice without the risk of injury and physical fatigue,’ said Ken Van Someren, head of research and development at the GSK High Performance Lab.

‘A lot of work has been done with baseball and American football, so the obvious transfer is into rugby, football and cricket; that’s where we’re starting. You can show a snapshot of a scenario or you can show video footage that stops at the critical time.

‘In cricket, we are filming the fast bowler and we stop it before the ball is released. By and large they recognise the shape of the bowler, what they do with their arm, recognising the pattern and making a bet based on that information. While we know that a small change in hydration status affects things like strength and stamina, we’re just starting to see that it can have a significant impact on cognition as well.’

Jenson Button, the Brownlee brothers and Adam Gemili have also been put through their paces in the testing house and, by collating intelligence from a range of the world’s leading sportsmen, the staff are able to challenge the accepted theories of sports science.

By testing the other five pillars of performance - strength, stamina, hydration, metabolism and recovery - the findings can be disseminated by a panel that includes James Collins, head nutritionist at Arsenal, and Dr Matt Parker, head of athletic performance at England Rugby.

‘What makes sports science so dynamic is that you have coaches that can’t afford to wait for a robust evidence base,’ said Van Someren. ‘If you’re Team A and you know that you’ve got to do everything you can to beat Team B, then as long as something doesn’t have a negative impact, you probably need to give it a go.

‘But does it all really work? Does the effectiveness of an ice bath blunt over time? There is a bit of evidence at the moment. Five years ago everyone jumped in ice baths but now we’re starting to be a little bit more circumspect; it might not all be positive.

‘We’ve got a cold-water pool and a hot-water pool, with three different depths. Is it the effect of the cold or is it the hydrostatic pressure and the depth of the water? Should you stand neck deep or waist deep? The scientists at GSK can help us work that out.’

Since “marginal gains” became a buzzword under Dave Brailsford during his time as performance director a British Cycling, all elite sports teams have been searching for their own points of difference. Whether it is a case of sleeping with the same pillow on away trips, or immersing into multi-million pound facilities.

‘What distinguishes first place from fourth place?’ said John Dams, head of strength and conditioning at Harlequins, who kick off their season against London Irish at Twickenham. ‘It’s about that extra two or three per cent. It comes down to small elements and we’re trying to improve wherever we can. It’s big data. Nutrition is a key pillar in making those differences and that’s why our relationship with MaxiNutrition is important. If you don’t get the basics right, then the rest can fall down.

'You have all this information and you need to best way to process it. No one’s quite there yet, especially in rugby, but over the next four or five years I think there will be a lot more investment in data analytics.’
