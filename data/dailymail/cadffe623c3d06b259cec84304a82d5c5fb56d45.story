The man's laptop and hard drive were sized during a raid on the man's home in 2012, reports The Australian.

Detectives have alleged the woman was drugged with sedative and was therefore unaware of what was happening when the videos and photos were taken which included sex acts performed on the sleeping woman with a green tree frog.

The man is accused of uploading the videos and photos to a pornography site and shared with other users videos of sex acts being performed on his wife to another person.

Police allege the woman never granted consent to her husband to take the images of her or upload them, reported the website.

In 2012 the charges against him were withdraw, but the case was re-opened following a review of the brief of evidence by the Office for the Director of Public Prosecutions which ruled there was sufficient evidence to recharge the man over the alleged offences due to the quantity of electronic evidence involved.
