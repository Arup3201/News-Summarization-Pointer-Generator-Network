Being both a famous actor and just 4-foot-2, Peter Dinklage gets a lot of stares on the street.

But one time that distraction proved deadly when a motorcyclist in Los Angeles crashed and died after taking his eyes off the road to ogle at the 44-year-old actor.

Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister on popular HBO series Game of Thrones, told Esquire about the incident that happened shortly after he hit it big in the 2003 film The Station Agent.

Fatal glance: Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister on HBO series Game of Thrones, says a motorcyclist died after getting distracted staring at him on a street in Los Angeles

Keep your eyes on the road: The accident happened one morning while he was walking down Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles (pictured above)

'I was walking down Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. There was this guy on a motorcycle right in front of me...maybe six feet? And he looked at me. He didn't wave, but he looked at me, and then he pulled out into traffic and this car, like, boom - killed him instantly.'

Cover guy: Dinklage recalled the traumatic event in a recent interview with Esquire magazine

'I was the last person he saw on earth,' Dinklage added.

After the accident, Dinklage says he ran into a coffee shop and had somebody call an ambulance.

By the time he got back outside the motorcyclist was already dead.

Dinklage says he didn't get too close to the man, but felt an emotional connection after locking eyes just before the crash.

'There was this quiet moment where it was like I was the only person in the world who knew this guy was dead. And I was there looking at him, you know, in those moments of calm after something horrible happens, the calm before the melee starts, before the ambulances and the cops arrive and it becomes a scene. There was that moment when I was with him.'

When the writer asks whether Dinklage is troubled for playing a role in the motorcyclist's death, he gets defensive.

'No! I never felt like that! Not at all.

'Oh,my God! F*** you. How dare... I never thought of that before. This was supposed to be a story about how I actually connected with a stranger...I'm gonna have nightmares tonight.'

Dinklage went on to say that while most of his encounters with fans are just people trying to take his picture, some of the connections have been very meaningful. Like the time a woman came up to him crying.

'She didn’t seem crazy or anything, so I asked what was the matter,' he recalled. 'And she was like, "I just wanted to tell you, my boyfriend died today. And The Station Agent was his favorite movie. This is like a sign that I saw you. I can’t believe this. May I please have a hug because I’m dying right now?"'

'And, of course, I gave her a hug,' Dinklage said.

Game of Thrones returns for a fourth season on April 6.
