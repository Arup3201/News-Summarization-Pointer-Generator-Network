Jose Enrique's substitute appearance against Tottenham last weekend was just four minute long, and came long after his teammates had sown up a dominant win.

But for the player himself it represented a huge moment, as the Spanish full-back got back onto the pitch for the first time since November 2013.

Enrique is now ready to return to life as a first-team regular, and says he is delighted to have put his injuries behind him, and feels 'like a child again' now that he is back playing.

'It was difficult,' Enrique told the Liverpool Echo. 'I didn't know at which point I'd be back, so psychologically it was really hard for me. Luckily, this is all in the past. I am fit again, I've been good and I'm now hopefully injury-free again.'

'Now I am training with my teammates again, I feel like the happiest guy in the world. I want to play, but I am so happy just to be back and training. 

'We had a friendly at Melwood recently and I looked forward to it like it was a Premier League game. Ten months without playing is a long, long time.

'I have been training every day, but games are completely different, so these types of friendlies are fantastic. I feel like a child right now, I am so happy.
