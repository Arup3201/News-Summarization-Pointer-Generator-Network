One of Labour’s most senior figures defected to Ukip last night in protest at Ed Miliband’s refusal to hold a referendum on Europe.

Harriet Yeo, a former chairman of Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee, quit in order to campaign for Nigel Farage’s party.

Her departure is a major embarrassment for Labour, which has started a belated fightback against Ukip in recent months.

Mrs Yeo served as chairman of the NEC, which runs the party, until 2013, and was leader of the Labour group on Ashford Borough Council in Kent. She is the most senior Labour figure to publicly back Ukip.

In a further sign of Labour tensions on the issue, the party’s biggest donor warned that Mr Miliband’s refusal to hold a referendum on Europe will ‘inevitably weaken’ Britain’s chances of getting a better deal from Brussels.

John Mills, who gave the party £1.65million in 2013, said ‘many in the Labour Party’ want Mr Miliband to abandon opposition to an in/out vote. Mrs Yeo could not be contacted for comment last night. 

But in a message on Twitter, her daughter Angharad – a former Ukip candidate – said: ‘Pleased that mummsy Caroline Yeo will be supporting Ukip in the 2015 election.’

Ukip also confirmed the defection. Nigel Farage said: ‘I’m delighted that Ukip can now count upon the support of such a respected figure as Harriet Yeo.

‘A life-long trade unionist and Labour Party member who served as chairman of Ed Miliband’s NEC, she is yet another voice calling for Britain to have a choice about its future. We are welcoming support from across the board and Harriet’s support is evidence of this.’

In a speech on the economy on Monday, Mr Miliband appeared to rule out holding a referendum on Europe. ‘The real threat to prosperity after the general election would be to leave the European Union,’ he said.

‘Under a Labour government, Britain will be a strong and proud member of a reformed EU.’

Mr Mills, a long-time supporter of a referendum, will today be among the keynote speakers at a conference in London examining options for Britain outside the EU.

Last night he said Mr Miliband’s hopes of reforming the EU would be seriously compromised by his opposition to a referendum.

‘If Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister in May and renegotiates without committing to a referendum, he will inevitably weaken the UK’s bargaining position,’ he said. ‘Minds in Brussels are much more likely to take renegotiation seriously if they know that there is a substantial risk that the UK will leave the EU if there is not a satisfactory deal on the table to persuade the UK to stay in.’

Former Tory Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, who is also speaking at the conference organised by the Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman, will also make the most explicit call yet for Britain to leave the EU.

He said last night Britain could become ‘really active, major players’. ‘I see a huge optimistic vision for this country, a really spectacular future, but to do it and to get there, we have to leave,’ he added.

Labour sources claimed Mrs Yeo had lost her role in Ashford for non-attendance at meetings. A spokesman said: ‘The vast majority of the Labour Party are united behind our position on Europe, believing Britain’s best interests are served by staying in a reformed EU and not sleepwalking towards an exit which would cost jobs and influence.’

One of Britain’s leading businessmen has accused Ed Miliband of being a ‘card carrying Marxist’ who is unfit to govern.

In the latest salvo from a captain of industry, Sir John Ritblat also accused the Labour leader of ‘learning nothing and forgetting everything’ from the financial crisis.

Sir John, who bought British Land for £1million in 1970 and transformed it into one of the UK’s biggest property investment companies, voiced concerns that a Labour government would ‘pick up some of the flaws of the French economy’. He said: ‘I would simply say there is a problem when the leadership is obviously very inexperienced, has never been involved in commerce and whose family tradition is one of left wing, totally unreconstructed, card carrying Marxists. This is not a good basis for pragmatic government.’

The 79-year-old City grandee, who was responsible for transforming the skyline of London with the development of the giant Broadgate office complex, added: ‘This all adds to the impression that Mr Miliband is unfit to govern.’ Last night one of Britain’s leading fashion entrepreneurs also joined the backlash against Labour.

Arguing Mr Miliband warrants his ‘Red Ed’ nickname, Harold Tillman – who previously owned British fashion chain Jaeger – said: ‘I am only just realising how socialist Miliband is. I am shocked at this, but Labour sound as if they want to stamp on aspiration.’

The criticism will be a blow to Labour, which this week slipped behind the Tories in the polls after a series of battles with big businesses.
