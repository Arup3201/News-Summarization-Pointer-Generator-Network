A former Mr Wales falsely claimed £28,000 in benefits payments while competing in bodybuilding competitions has been jailed for six months.  

Peter Beddoe, 50, of Aberdare, claimed on his application that he was too weak to walk, but went to the gym almost every day in order to stay in peak physical condition for competitions.

The court heard that his first claim was genuine when he was left wheelchair-bound after a fall.

Bodybuilder: Peter Beddoe competed in a number of competitions while claiming Disability Living Allowance

But he continued to claim Disability Allowance, designed to assist those suffering from chronic illness and injuries, for seven years - while continuing to compete in national competitions. 

The amateur bodybuilder was receiving a higher rate of disability allowance meant for people who cannot walk, after claiming he needed a walking stick or crutches to get around. 

He twice won the title of Mr Wales in a senior bodybuilding competition that required him to attend the gym regularly and keep in peak physical condition. 

In August 2009 the amateur bodybuilder, who worked out at his local gym hundreds of times a year, filed a claim on the same day that he entered a competition. 

Claims: On one occasion, Beddoe submitted an application to claim Disability Allowance on the same day he was competing in a bodybuilding competition. He has been jailed for six months

In the application, Beddoe said: 'I need a frame to walk. I will injure myself without some form of support.' 

In August he was photographed showing off his body after winning the veterans section of the 'Kent Classic' event, in Gravesend, above

Jailing him today,  a judge at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court said: 'In my opinion this disgraceful series of offences harms the whole community.' 

Between 2008 and 2012 he won the National Amateur Bodybuilding Association (NABBA) Masters over 40s tournament in 2008 and 2012.

In 2009 he came third in the Seniors Over 40 United Kingdom Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation (UKBFF) Welsh Championships.

He came third again in the same section of the South Coast 2009 championships at the Guild Hall, in Portsmouth.

As recently as August he was photographed showing off his body after winning the veterans section of the 'Kent Classic' event, in Gravesend.

He was jailed after he admitted last month to two counts of making dishonest representations to obtain a benefit and one count of fraud.

Stewart McLeese, prosecuting for the Department of Work and Pensions, said: 'An investigation discovered that Mr Beddoe was an amateur bodybuilder.'

He said evidence was found that he had competed in competitions around the country and was a former senior Mr Wales winner.

He added that Beddoe was claiming the DLA mobility allowance at the highest rate and the care element at the lowest rate.

Lawrence Jones, defending, said Beddoe had legitimately claimed DLA at the outset when he had been wheelchair bound after a serious fall.

His guilty plea was on the basis that he had begun claiming cash legitimately.

Beddoe still suffered from a degenerative spinal problem and continued to go to the gym for health reasons, he said.

Mr Jones said: 'He is still doing high level reistance training. He still goes to the gym to lift weights. He accepts that.

'He trains with weights twice a week and uses a steam room three times a week to relax his muscles.' 

Beddoe, who is already repaying the cash dishonestly claimed at a rate of £10 a week, was ordered to pay £535 in costs.

He worked out at his local gym, DW Fitness 1,100 times in a five year period from mid 2008, the court heard
