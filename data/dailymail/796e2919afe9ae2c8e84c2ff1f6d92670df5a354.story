It's a terrace taunt often thrown at Manchester United fans from supporters of their cross-town rivals.

The age-old accusation that most of the Old Trafford club's following do not come from the city from which they are based.

'You're the pride of Singapore,' they sing.

But according to Sports Direct, it is actually City whose fans are not from the area.

Figures released by the retailer show that, between the two in Manchester, 94.57 per cent of shirts sold are in the red of United compared to just 5.43 per cent in the blue of City.

Manchester United took up 94.57 per cent  of the Manchester shirt sale market in 2014

44.71 percent of United replica shirt sales were recorded in London, Dublin was second, Manchester third

Dutch striker Robin van Persie (above) and Louis van Gaal could be the reason behind sales in Fijnaart

Just 4.72 per cent of Manchester City replica shirt sales were made in Manchester, London ranks highest

Nationwide, however, most of both club's shirts are sold in London stores.

A total of 44.71 per cent of United tops are purchased in the capital compared to 27.95 per cent of City jerseys.

Among shirts of London clubs sold within the city, Arsenal lead the way with 47.35 per cent of tops sold from clubs based in the capital those of the Gunners.

They are followed by Chelsea, with 35.2 per cent and Spurs with 17.45 per cent.

The report, based on sales since the season began, threw up some surprising findings.

Behind London and Glasgow, most City shirts are bought in Fijnaart, a village of 5,500 in the Netherlands. Places such as Dublin, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Leeds and Stockport place higher than Manchester.

Arsenal may struggle to compete with Chelsea on the field but they beat them easily in London shirt sales

Arsenal  sold 61 percent of their shirts in London with Sheffield in second and Southend in third

Lagos was the second most popular place for Chelsea shirts with London storming ahead with 56.3 percent

Tottenham shirt sales were unsurprisingly dominated by the London market with Dublin sneaking in third

The findings suggest Harry Kane and his Tottenham Hotspur team mates have a big following in Dublin

As for United, Dublin beats Manchester into second place.

Strangely, Sports Direct sell the most Aston Villa jerseys in Dublin, perhaps a reminder of ex-Republic of Ireland legend Paul McGrath's stint at Villa Park.

Most Liverpool shirts are sold in London with Dublin and – bizarrely – Bristol shifting more than Liverpool itself.

The majority of Liverpool shirts were sold in London with both Dublin and Bristol higher than their home city

And a strange-but-true 4.87 per cent of Liverpool tops are shifted in Manchester.

Elsewhere, behind London most Arsenal jerseys are sold in Sheffield while Lagos is the second-most popular market for Chelsea shirts.

The list was based on the company's top-eight sellers and can be viewed HERE.
