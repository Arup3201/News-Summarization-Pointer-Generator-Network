Issue: Dr Hilary Cass said children's units, which attract higher numbers of female doctors, were a particular cause of concern

Women doctors who only work part-time are causing staffing issues that could create problems in the future, an expert has warned.

Dr Hilary Cass said children's units, which attract higher numbers of female doctors, were a particular cause of concern.

She said many tended to work three days a week once they had started families, which led to gaps in the rota which means the remaining doctors had to work for longer periods.

She also said UK care of sick children compared poorly with the rest of Europe and many more lives could be saved.

Dr Cass, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said there were currently no safety issues, but the situation could change for the worse.

There are just under 5,000 paediatricians in the UK, of whom three quarters are women. Dr Cass said children's wards traditionally had higher numbers of female doctors.

Surgery and A&E on the other hand tend to attract more men as they are regarded as 'macho'.

She said: 'Female doctors make great paediatricians but we do have problems planning.

'A significant proportion of people will be working less than full time so our numbers are less than we need to cover rotas.

'We are certainly trying to encourage men. I'm not saying we've got too many women, but the particular balance of females to males just happens to make it harder for us to plan services and means we have a high vacancy rate.

'We end up with gaps in the rotas. The result of that is that consultants have to work very short notice overnight and work the next day.

'As a speciality we can carry that on for a while but we wouldn't really want an airline pilot working like that and don't want a paediatrician doing that.

'At the moment we have not reached the stage where it's unsafe, per se, because the majority of time we have cover.

'But if it continues – and if we haven't got better ways of running services and that affects morale and recruitment into the  speciality . . . then that will become problematic. We're holding the line on patient safety, but it's not a good long-term position.'

Dr Cass told Radio 4's Woman's Hour  that the lives of 1,500 children in Britain could be saved every year if the care matched that of other Western European countries.

She warned that common conditions such as asthma, meningitis and pneumonia were not being picked up early enough by doctors.

Dr Cass said: 'We've looked at mortality rates for children up to ages of 18 and we're comparing poorly not just with Sweden but most of Western Europe.'

'It's with common childhood illnesses that we should be able to pick up and treat. Things like asthma, meningitis and pneumonia that are a real test of how the health system is working.'

She added: 'It's a whole system problem. It's not about paediatrics doing badly or GPs doing badly or A&E doctors, it's about how we work together across system and how well trained everyone is to recognise a child who is sick.'
