Some 100 brains specimens which went missing from The University of Texas nearly 30 years ago have been found.

The samples -  about half of the university's collection which were preserved in jars of formaldehyde - disappeared from a facility in Austin in the 1990s. 

They were discovered this week at a university building in San Antonio.

Timothy Schallert, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at UT in Austin, told the Los Angeles Times: 'They have the brains. They read a media report of the missing brains and they called to say: ''We got those brains!''' 

The professor said he believed that the brains had been well cared for. 

His colleague, Professor Lawrence Cormack, had earlier said that students could have stolen the brains as a prank.

The brains were provided from patients at the state mental hospital for research on diseases including Alzheimer's. 

The Austin State Hospital had transferred the brains to the university about 28 years ago under a 'temporary possession' agreement.

The psychology lab only had room for 100 brains, so the rest were moved to the basement of the university's Animal Resources Center. 

The story came to light this week after a book was published called 'Malformed: Forgotten Brains of the Texas State Mental Hospital' by Adam Voorhes and Alex Hannaford.

One of the missing brains reportedly belonged to Austin University clock tower sniper Charles Whitman. 

Whitman's 1966 rampage at the University of Texas killed 16 people, including his mother and wife, and wounded 32 others 

The 100 remaining brains at the Austin school have been moved to the Norman Hackerman Building, where they are being scanned with high-resolution resonance imaging equipment.

Mr Cormack said: 'These MRI images will be both useful teaching and research tools. It keeps the brains intact.'
