A MYSTERY disease killing dogs across the country continues to claim victims and baffle vets.

Nearly 50 pets of various breeds are feared to have contracted it in the last 18 months, with 21 dying.

Symptoms include skin lesions on the legs and chest, lethargy, loss of appetite and vomiting. Within days, the illness attacks the kidneys, often leading to a long drawn-out death.

Mapped: Where the killer disease has struck

Half of the confirmed cases have centred around the New Forest in Hampshire, although others have occurred as far afield as Yorkshire, Cornwall, Worcestershire, County Durham, Surrey and Dorset.

The latest casualty is Tegan, a three-year-old fox terrier cross, who died after walking near Ashurst in the New Forest.

Owner Sarah Thairs, of North Baddesly, Hampshire, took her to the vet but her  condition worsened and Tegan died late last month. ‘My poor little girl had been through so much,’ she said.

‘Tests showed the disease had gone to her pancreas. I had to make the decision to put her down, which is heartbreaking.’ Another victim was Summer, an 11-year-old Weimaraner owned by Angela Larder.

The latest casualty was Tegan, pictured, a three-year-old fox terrier cross, who died after walking at the Deerleap enclosure near Ashurst in the New Forest. Owner Sarah Thairs, from North Baddesly near Romsey took her dog to the vets last month but they couldn't stop her condition deteriorating

The pet died two weeks after the nurse and her boyfriend had a break in Brockenhurst in the New Forest. ‘We had to make the excruciating decision to put her to sleep,’ said Miss Larder.

‘It was the most difficult thing to do. She was old but healthy. The hardest part was watching her die day by day.

‘I still feel guilt and responsibility that our weekend break ended in her death.

 Experts have been left perplexed by the outbreak, but think the disease is similar to Alabama Rot.

Alabama
 Rot is the common name for diopathic renal glomerular vasculopathy, a 
disease which surfaced in greyhounds in Alabama in the 1980s.

It is believed to be caused by a rare form of E.coli.

The earliest signs of Alabama rot are skin lesions on the legs, chest and abdomen that spread across the skin.

These symptoms then develop into liver failure, and death.

Vet David Walker said the recent pathogen is the same as that found in Alabama.

It is a disease of the blood vessels that leads to cell death and affects the dog's skin and kidneys.

Common symptoms are the dog losing its appetite, becoming unusually quiet and vomiting.

‘I can’t even think about  getting another dog but if the time ever comes, I know I will never, ever walk my dog in a  forest again. I couldn’t take that chance with an animal’s life.’ John Tricker’s border collie Barney, eight, was also struck down by the disease after he walked him in the forest at Latchmore Brook, Hampshire.

Mr Tricker, 59, a car salesman, said: ‘Barney was my friend, my partner and defender.

‘I whispered in his ear that I loved him more than anything in the world as the vet put him to sleep and he still wagged his tail. I miss him and will never  forget him.’

Vets point to similarities with Alabama Rot, a disease first reported in greyhounds in the US in the 1980s.

It is believed to be caused by a rare form of the E.coli bacteria.

he investigation into the illness has been led by vet David Walker since it emerged in 2012.

‘We know the pathogen is the same as that in Alabama Rot,’ he said ‘It is a disease of the  blood vessels that leads to cell death.

‘We don’t know what the trigger for the disease is, which makes it very hard to treat or advise on the best action.

‘There is no pattern among the dogs which have died.’

He added there was no evidence that owners should avoid a specific area as there have been cases around the country.

There have been 24 confirmed cases plus 24 unconfirmed. Some dogs have survived and the  disease does not appear to pass from animal to animal.

The lives of Summer, a Weimaraner, (left) and Barney, a collie, (right) were both taken by the disease. Summer died two weeks after being taken on a break to the New Forest by owner Angela Larder. 'She was old but but healthy,' Miss Larder said. Barney also died after being walked in the forest at Latchmore Brook, Hampshire
