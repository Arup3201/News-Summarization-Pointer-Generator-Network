Loic Remy will not be wearing Chelsea’s cursed No 9 jersey this season. 

The exit of Fernando Torres had freed up the shirt traditionally worn by centre forwards. But Remy, who has joined Chelsea in a £10.5million deal from Queens Park Rangers, has opted for No 18, confirmed on Wednesday night when Premier League clubs submitted their 25-man squad lists.

The No 9 shirt will remain vacant until January at least, and that is perhaps best given its recent history.

Chelsea fans will know wearing the No 9 shirt doesn't always bring good fortune to Stamford Bridge.

Blues fans will look back fondly on years in which the famous number was worn by the likes of Kerry Dixon and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.

However, the digit didn't bring as much luck to Serbian striker Mateja Kezman or Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz during their time in west London.

Torres scored just 20 league goals during three-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge. His predecessor, Franco Di Santo, failed to score any, and Steve Sidwell and Khalid Boulahrouz did not enjoy happy stays at the club. 

Before that there was Argentina striker Hernan Crespo, and his one season wearing the shirt produced 10 goals. Mateja Kezman arrived from PSV having scored 78 in two seasons in Holland but as the Chelsea No 9 managed just seven.

Petr Cech has retained the No 1 jersey despite Thibaut Courtois starting the season as Jose Mourinho’s first-choice goalkeeper.

Elsewhere, Spurs have omitted defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto from their squad and he could now head out on loan to the Championship.

But there is a place for Manchester United misfit Anderson in Louis van Gaal’s squad. Fabio Borini is also included at Liverpool, despite appearing to be on his way out of Anfield before a deadline-day move to Queens Park Rangers collapsed because of his wage demands.
