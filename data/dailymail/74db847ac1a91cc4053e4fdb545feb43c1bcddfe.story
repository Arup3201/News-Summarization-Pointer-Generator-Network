Arrests: Three women aged 25, 28 and 65 were detained yesterday on suspicion of assisting an offender by officers working on the nurse Rui Li murder case

Three women have been arrested in connection with the inquiry into the murder of nurse Rui Li.

Dorset Police said the women, aged 25, 28 and 65, were detained yesterday on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Ms Li’s body was found inside a Fiat Punto, in Verwood Crescent, Bournemouth on Friday night having been last seen alive on May 23.

Her husband, Pierre Legris, 60, has appeared in court charged with his wife’s murder and has been remanded into custody.

Legris is accused of murdering the 44-year-old at his home in Burnham Drive, Bournemouth between May 22 and May 31.

His son, 26-year-old Jonathan Legris, has been charged with assisting an offender and has been bailed to appear before Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court on June 17.

Yesterday an inquest into Ms Li’s death was opened and adjourned.

The hearing heard she died from blunt force trauma to the head. The results of toxicology and histology tests are still pending.

A Dorset Police spokeswoman said: 'Three women aged 25, 28 and 65-years-old respectively, all from Bournemouth, were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and are helping officers with their enquiries.'

Ms Li was last seen alive by her 18-year-old daughter, Lu Yao, at their home in Burnham Drive on the evening of May 23.

The nurse was captured on CCTV earlier that day as she drove out of the car park at Poole Hospital in her Porsche Boxster car after finishing work.

Ms Li moved to the UK from China a decade ago and had worked at the hospital since 2009.
