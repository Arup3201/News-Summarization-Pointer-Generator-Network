'Liverpool are definitely a great club,' Sportiello told Italian newspaper L'Eco di Bergamo. 'We are talking about one of the top clubs in the world.

'This is my first year as a starter and I recently signed a new contract with Atalanta. 

'My life has changed in a few months.'

Liverpool are looking to sign a goalkeeper this summer with club manager Brendan Rodgers  keen to increase competition for Simon Mignolet.

A youth product of Atalanta, Sportiello became the club's first-choice goalkeeper this season.

Sportiello has pulled off 95 saves and kept seven clean sheets in 26 league starts to ensure the Bergamo outfit remain above the drop zone.

Atalanta extended Sportiello's contract until June 2019 earlier this year.
