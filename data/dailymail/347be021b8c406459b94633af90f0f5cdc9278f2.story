By air and by land, the rescue of hundreds of Coloradoans stranded by epic mountain flooding was accelerating as food and water supplies ran low.

Meanwhile, thousands more were driven from their homes on the plains as debris-filled rivers became muddy seas inundating towns and farms miles from the Rockies.

For the first time since the harrowing mountain floods began Wednesday, Colorado got its first broad view of the devastation - and the reality of what is becoming a long-term disaster is setting in. The flooding has affected parts of a 4,500-square-mile area, almost the size of Connecticut.

Overflowing: The heavy rains have impacted a large stretch of Colorado from Fort Collins near the northern border with Wyoming, all the way to Boulder, Denver and Colorado Springs more than 100 miles south

Geysers of sewage: A Sewer in Manitou Springs is overwhelmed by rainfall yesterday, gurgling the overflow of water

National
Guard choppers were evacuating 295 people - plus pets - from the 
mountain hamlet of Jamestown, which was isolated by flooding that 
scoured the canyon the town sits in.

Mike
Smith, incident commander at Boulder Municipal Airport, said 
helicopters would continue flying in and out late into the night.

The outlook for anyone who'd rather stay is weeks without power, cell phone service, water or sewer.For
those awaiting an airlift, Guardsmen dropped food, water and other 
supplies in Jamestown and other small towns in the winding, narrow 
canyons that dot the Rocky Mountain foothills.

Thousands of evacuees sought shelter in cities that were nearly surrounded by raging rivers spilling over their banks.

The
dayslong rush of water from higher ground has killed four people and 
turned towns on Colorado's expansive eastern plains into muddy swamps.

Crews
used inflatable boats to rescue families and pets from stranded 
farmhouses. Some evacuees on horseback had to be escorted to safe 
ground.

Boulder County 
officials said Friday night that the number of people unaccounted for 
had risen to 172, according to local television and newspaper reports.

Record-breaking: Over 12 inches of rain has fallen since September 1, which shatters the previous record set in the 1940s of 5.5 inches

The officials said earlier that the unaccounted for figure doesn't necessarily represent missing people.

Near
Greeley, some 35 miles east of the foothills, broad swaths of farmland 
had become lakes, and hundreds of roads were closed or damaged by 
floodwaters. A 70-mile stretch of Interstate 25 was closed from Denver 
to the Wyoming line.

Rocky
Mountain National Park closed Friday, its visitors forced to leave via 
the 60-mile Trail Ridge Road to the west side of the Rockies.

It
will be weeks, if not months, before a semblance of normalcy returns to
Lyons, a gateway community to the park. The town, surrounded by 
sandstone cliffs whose color was reflected in the raging St. Vrain 
River, consisted of six islands Friday as residents barbecued their food
before it spoiled. Several people set up a tent camp on a hill.

Some 2,500 residents were being evacuated from Lyons. Two bridges that led into the area were washed away. Â

'There's so much water coming out of 
the canyon, it has to go somewhere, and unfortunately it's coming into 
the city,' said Ashlee Herring, spokeswoman for the Boulder office of 
Emergency Management.

Boulder
Creek, which runs through the heart of the city, became a raging 
torrent that burst its banks and flooded adjacent parking lots and 
streets as warning sirens wailed.

Officials
in Boulder announced just before midnight Thursday that they were 
tracking a large 'wall of water, containing debris and vehicles' headed 
towards Emerson Gulch from the Fourmile burn area.

The Denver Post
reported that the 30-foot wall of water was caused by a drainage gulch 
that burst and released a large amount of water which swept up debris 
and vehicles in it's path.

Other towns nestled along the Front Range of the Rockies north of Denver were also hard hit.

In Longmont about 14 miles northeast of Boulder, the St Vrain River jumped its banks, cascading across main thoroughfares and making travel across the city impossible overnight.

'Our city is completely divided,' by the floodwaters, assistant city manager Shawn Lewis told Reuters.

Lewis said 7,000 households were under mandatory evacuation orders. The city opened two emergency shelters for displaced residents.

President Barack Obama approved a federal disaster assistance request, which will release funds to help with emergency protection, Governor John Hickenlooper's office said late on Thursday.

National Guard troops were dispatched with emergency supplies to the remote town of Lyons, north of Boulder, which was virtually cut off from surrounding areas when floodwaters washed out U.S. Route 36, county officials said.

A dozen major roads in northeastern Colorado remained shut with significant damage from flooding, mudslides, rockfalls and other debris, the Colorado Department of Transportation said late on Thursday.

Heavy summer rains are not unusual for Colorado, but the intensity and duration of the downpour that began on Monday night was unprecedented.

The National Weather Service said at least 12.3 inches of rain have fallen on Boulder since September 1, smashing a 73-year-old record of 5.5 inches for the month.

One body was found in a collapsed building near Jamestown, an evacuated enclave north of Boulder.

A couple were swept away in floodwaters after stopping their car northwest of the city. The man's body was recovered but the woman was missing and feared dead, said Commander Heidi Prentup of the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.

The body of a third confirmed fatality, a 54-year-old man, was found by police on flood-watch patrols in a Colorado Springs creek, about 100 miles to the south, officials said.

On Friday, a woman who had been swept away was found dead near Boulder, raising the death toll to four.

Nearly 150 people were killed near Boulder in 1976 by a flash flood along the Big Thompson Canyon.
