Manchester United do not need a big-name boss to lure the best players to Old Trafford in the wake of David Moyes’ sacking, says Gary Neville.

The former United defender insists it is irrelevant who the manager is at Old Trafford, all that matters is the results. 

United struggled in the transfer market 
last summer, and may find it tough again in the coming months without 
Champions League football next season.

Failed: David Moyes (right) blew his big chance at United with a series of colourless displays in defeat

Aura: Louis van Gaal is a big enough personality to deal with United stars such as Robin van Persie

Neville told Sky Sports: ‘The reality of it is that it doesn’t really matter who the manager is. What matters most to Manchester United fans is that they actually win football matches and get back to where they belong.

‘The suggestion that they need a big manager to attract players to the club, I find that a bit sad to be fair.

‘The idea that Manchester United 
Football Club need to have a sort-of figurehead to be able to attract 
players is a nonsense as far as I’m concerned.

‘Manchester United, as a football club, is big enough in its own right to be able to attract players - and they should be.

‘It
 seems to be pointing in that direction and I suppose at the start of 
next season, if they can spend the money that they have wisely and 
there’s a new big-name manager then times will be exciting again.’

Inexperienced: Jurgen Klopp has won a title but has no real knowledge of how to spend £200m

Man for any job: Carlo Ancelotti would do a very good job for a number of Premier League clubs

Option: Given the right circumstances, Jose Mourinho would be interested in the United job
