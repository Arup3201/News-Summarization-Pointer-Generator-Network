Leicester City have made an enquiry for West Bromwich Albion midfielder Graham Dorrans.

The 27-year-old Scotland international will be allowed to leave by Tony Pulis for the right offer as he looks to strengthen elsewhere in his squad.

Dorrans has made 21 appearance in all competitions for the Baggies this season, scoring once.

Burnley made an initial enquiry but wanted a loan deal with a permanent option at the end of the season while Championship side Fulham have also asked about Dorrans.

Leicester have money to spend as they look to launch a survival fight from the foot of the table. 

They are three points off Burnley in 17th and only five behind Albion.
