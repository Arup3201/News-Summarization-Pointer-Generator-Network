A mother who put up a £10,000 reward after thieves targeted her home has been charged with kidnapping a man she believes was responsible.

Tracey Taylor, 41, offered the huge amount of cash for information about the burglar who stole an entire safe from her home while her family were at a funeral.

She described her family as 'devastated' by the loss of jewellery and a substantial amount of money, but now she has been charged, along with two men, with kidnapping.

Anthony Charles, 43, of Strood, has also been charged along with another man, Johan Van Vwren, 37,
of Sevenoaks, both in Kent.

Tracey Taylor, who put up a £10,000 reward after thieves targeted her home in Strood, Kent, has been charged with kidnapping a man she believes was responsible

They allegedly bundled the man into a car which was later intercepted by police.

Maidstone Magistrates’ Court heard the man was allegedly kidnapped on the Promenade in Leysdown, Kent.

Taylor, also from Strood, appealed for information after burglars broke into her home and prised a safe off the wall in the basement and made off with it on July 31.

At the time, the personal trainer said there was a substantial amount of money in the safe along with some jewellery.

She said she knew immediately something was wrong as she could see a kitchen window was open.

When another occupant, Anthony Charles, went into the basement of the home, he discovered the safe had gone.

After the burglary, Miss Taylor put up a poster in her window so people in the area would notice the £10,000 appeal.

At the time, she said: 'We were attending the funeral of a family friend, a young man taken from his family too young.

'To add to that terrible day, we returned to find our home had been broken into and our personal belongings gone.

'The jewellery has considerable emotional value and we are devastated.'

Taylor appeared at Maidstone Magistrates’ Court on Monday charged with kidnap.

She was arrested on Sunday on the A249, just past the Sheppey Crossing in Kent.

An eyewitness, who saw the arrest, 
said: 'I thought there had been an accident at first because you 
sometimes see a police car blocking traffic towards the bridge at 
Cowstead Corner.

'But 
as I was diverted on to the old road towards the Kingsferry Bridge, I 
noticed the car had been stopped by two police vehicles, which were 
parked ahead and behind it and it was clear there was more to it.'

Miss Taylor, Mr Van Vwren and Mr Charles were all charged with 'unlawfully and by the use of force or fraud taking or carrying away [the victim] against his will contrary to common law on August 5, 2012'.

A police source confirmed the kidnap charge facing Miss Taylor relates to the break-in at her home.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Officers received a report of a suspicious vehicle on The Promenade in Leysdown on Sunday, August 5, at 12.37pm.

'Officers attended and located the vehicle on the A249 just over the bridge.

'The car was stopped and the occupants spoken with.

'The man was found to be safe and well.

'While officers were at the scene, the road was closed and reopened at 3.18pm.

'Three people were subsequently arrested and were charged with kidnap.'

The trio have been bailed to appear before Maidstone Crown Court on August 20.
