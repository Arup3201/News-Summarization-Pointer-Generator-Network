The setting is quintessential England; green hills roll to the distance, a river thunders by, and an old, terraced mining village rests on the horizon.

How fitting that on the football pitch amid this luscious landscape trains the only squad in the top four divisions made up entirely of Englishmen.

The hills belong to County Durham, the river is the Wear, the village Sherburn and the football team Hartlepool United. Sir Bobby Robson was born five miles away, how proud he would have been.

Here, the club’s top earner takes home less than £1500 per week while the lowest paid pro is on £400. These are austere times. They would be forgiven for reverting to a traditional tactic.

‘Yeah, we just bash it up to a big man, is that what you think?’ manager Colin Cooper asks Sportsmail.

A few minutes into training and it’s clear they do not. Amid all of this debate about our national footballing identity and FA commissions and reports, here is a team full of Englishmen who actually pass the ball.

Cooper, capped once by England despite the best attempts of former Ireland boss Mick McCarthy to ‘resurrect my great-grandfather’, would not have it any other way.

The training session includes former West Ham striker Marlon Harewood, now 34, and grizzly centre-back Sam Collins, a veteran of 600 matches. 

Also on show is Brad Walker, an 18-year-old midfielder who already has more than 40 senior appearances to his name and was in March named Football League Apprentice of the Year. He inherited that prize from team-mate Luke James, a 19-year-old who has 22 professional goals.

Defender Matthew Bates, the former Middlesbrough skipper, has seen some star names graduate from their academy but believes Walker and James are lucky to be at Hartlepool.

‘I have spoken to both and I think they should stay here,’ said the 27-year-old.

‘I look at Brad, I’ve played with some brilliant 18-year-olds but he is one of the best I’ve ever seen.

‘He has got all of the ability and will go on to play in the Premier League. But he’s playing regularly here with a great manager behind him.’

Cooper believes Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana – who played for Southampton at Hartlepool’s Victoria Park three years ago – are an inspiration to young English players.

‘It’s brilliant, I really think what they have done is great,’ he said.

‘If I’m a lad who is in my early 20s and it hasn’t quite happened for me, then Rickie Lambert is an inspiration.

‘I think that’s an absolutely brilliant story. Those things can happen but you’ve got to graft for it.’

So has the English model come about by chance or design?

Legend, after all, says this is the town which hung a monkey when they believed it to be a French spy having washed up on their shores from a shipwreck during the Napoleonic War.

But Cooper says: ‘I must be honest, it’s no effort on my part that I only sign English players. I have played with world-class foreign players and you can only learn from them.

‘Our boys here are English, yes, but the most important thing for us is that they’re young lads from the North-East.

‘They might not have been able to make it at one of the big three clubs in the region and they find themselves here having to work very hard to forge a football career.

‘But we have some tremendous talent and we are giving them a chance to show that.’

Bates, having just broken from a group photograph with his compatriots, remarks: ‘None of us realised we’re all English to be honest. But I think it’s great.

‘Let’s hope we can represent the country well because it might filter through the leagues and others might realise it is the way to go.

‘The domestic market has gone crazy – look at Ross McCormack for £12million – and you don’t blame clubs for looking abroad for value. But lower down there are a lot of good English lads out there.’

Journeyman: Former Premier League star Harewood has made Hartlepool his 10th club

Hartlepool kick off their League Two campaign at Stevenage on Saturday where they’ll come up against a Frenchmen and a Zairian.

But Bates believes the northern boys are flying the flag for their country.

‘Let’s hope England can be champions of League Two and that English core, with that charisma and togetherness, can get us through,’ he says.

‘But come and watch us, we pass it as well and we’ve got some cracking young players.’

There you have it then, Hartlepool United - an English team worth watching.
