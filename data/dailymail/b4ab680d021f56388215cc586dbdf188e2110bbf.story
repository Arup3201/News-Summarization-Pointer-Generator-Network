Apple proved a smartphone camera can rival some of the features of professional devices when it released its iPhone 5S, and now the firm has taken a step further by acquiring photography app SnappyCam.  

Reports claim the Californian-tech giant bought the popular, high-end photography app over the new year, but the cost of the deal has not yet been announced.

The 69p app, which has since been removed from the app store, features a professional ‘burst mode’ and up to six times zoom.

An Apple patent filed in November detailed a system capable of capturing low-resolution images that can be refocused even after they’ve been taken and processed.

It would do this by capturing the whole light field of an image, similar to the technology seen in Lytro cameras, meaning the shots appear in 3D rather than 2D.

According to patent papers,
 which were originally filed in 2011, photographers could take an image 
and change the main area of focus numerous times to produce different 
shots.

These images would be taken through what’s called a microlens array.

According
 to Apple's patent, this array would be detachable and could be removed 
when the user wanted to take a traditional high-resolution photo.

Burst mode lets users take multiple photos in one take and then select the best image.

It’s predominantly used in professional photography to capture action shots in sport, for example.

However, since the likes of Samsung and Apple have introduced the feature in their latest handsets, it is becoming more popular among amateur photographers.

Apple added burst mode to its iSight camera with the release of its iPhone 5S last year. It can capture 10 photos per second.

By comparison, SnappyCam’s burst mode can capture 20 photos per second. This is because it captures between 20 and 30 frames per second, and in certain models of phone is said to be capable of up to 60 frames per second.

SnappyCam also captures these images at a full resolution of 8-megapixels.

Elsewhere, Apple’s iPhone 5S zoom is only half the capability of SnappyCam’s. 

Apple's vice president of worldwide marketing Philip Schiller, pictured, unveiled the improved iSight camera of the iPhone 5S last year. Apple added burst mode to this camera, which captures 10 photos per second. By comparison, SnappyCam's burst mode can capture 20 photos per second

SnappyCam, pictured, topped the Apple's App Store list in 16 countries during 2013

Samsung’s S4 shoots up 20 pictures continuously at full-sensor resolution, but each photo is taken at 0.1333 seconds apart, according to SnappyCam, which averages out at 7.5 photos per second.

By acquiring SnappyCam, Apple may be looking to add the app’s super-fast and professional features to future models of its iPhone and iPad.

The acquisition could also improve Apple’s video recording capabilities.

It added slow-motion video to its iPhone 5S that  records at 120 frames per second and SnappyCam could help improve the quality of this, too.

In a statement, an Apple spokeswoman said: ‘Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.’

SnappyCam topped the Apple’s App Store list in 16 countries during 2013 and is run by its founder John Papandriopoulos.
