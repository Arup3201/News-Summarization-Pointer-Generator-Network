Abuse of trust: Self-taught hypnotist Timothy Porter, 40, performed a vile act on a woman while she was in a trance

A man who hypnotised a married mother and made her perform sex acts is facing a prison sentence.

Self-taught
hypnotist Timothy Porter exposed himself and made his patient fondle 
her breasts during what was  supposed to be a weight-loss session in her
home.

The startled victim woke from a trance after something touched her neck and saw the 40-year-old with his trousers down.

Fitness
fanatic Porter, a former serviceman who was based at RAF Leeming in 
North Yorkshire, had half a dozen treatment sessions with the mother of 
three last year.

Prosecutors
said Porter’s conduct and conversations became ‘sexualised’ at an early
stage of their meetings.

In December, during a visit to the woman’s 
home in North Yorkshire – while her children slept upstairs – he put her
into a hypnotic trance.

She contacted police after ‘waking’ to find him with his trousers down and ordering her to touch herself.

Porter,
now living in Blackburn, admitted causing a person to engage in sexual 
activity when he appeared at Teesside Crown Court.

He will be sentenced next month after background reports have been prepared by probation workers, and was given bail until then.

It is thought Porter is married with a child, and he was accompanied at court yesterday by a woman. He honed his skills 'purely as a hobby' while reaching the rank of corporal in the RAF.

Court papers reveal that he was due to leave the RAF around the time of the offence.

On
one occasion, he asked his victim if she would like to experience 
‘heightened orgasms’.

Porter had claimed that nothing sexual happened 
during the visits to his victim’s home in the year leading up to the 
offence.

After he admitted 
the charge, an interim order was made for him to sign the Sex Offenders’
Register. The length of the registration will depend on his sentence.

A
source said: ‘It was when she was hypnotised that he started to become a
bit more lewd.

'He says there was nothing sexual in the lead-up to the 
one incident, but her account is there was some untoward behaviour.

‘It’s simply not known if there are other clients, but he did bill himself as an amateur hypnotist.’

Advances: Teesside Crown Court that the woman had sought help with weight problems - but Porter also asked her if she wanted to experience 'heightened orgasms'

Detective Constable Graeme Bevington that Porter had no formal qualifications as a hypnotherapist and appeared to be entirely self-taught.

'He told us he had performed hypnosis on other people,' the detective said. 'I don't think he has any qualifications, if there are formal qualifications.

'He said he had been practising and teaching himself for a number of years. It is never something he has done as a profession. It was purely a hobby.'

Speaking about the victim, Det Con Bevington said: 'She is ok. She is pleased it is over and done with and is now looking forward to moving on.

'She is pleased he has been taken to court and brought to justice for what he has done, because she feels he has abused her trust.

'She was quite nervous about the court process and having to face him in court and give evidence, if he had not pleaded guilty and if it had been a trial.'
