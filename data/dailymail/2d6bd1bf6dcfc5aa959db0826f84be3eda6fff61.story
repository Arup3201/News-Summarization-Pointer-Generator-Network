Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football... Phil Jones was one of two Manchester United players to run faster than 20mph during the Red Devils' defeat by Swansea, Gareth Barry is closing in on 100 career yellow cards while Sam Allardyce has looks to have changed his style at West Ham.

1. Louis van Gaal’s top priority in the transfer market will be to inject pace into Manchester United’s team.

Apart from West Brom all the Premier League sides who played on Saturday had a player who produced a swifter sprint than Ashley Young’s top speed of 20.7mph. 

Top speed: Phil Jones was one of two Man United players to get over 20mph against Swansea at Old Trafford

The only other United player to get above 20mph in the EA Sports ratings was defender Phil Jones - not all that encouraging when you think the 3-5-2 system that van Gaal has brought from the World Cup relied on the searing sprints of Arjen Robben. His fastest sprint was recorded at more than 22mph.

2. Gareth Barry looks stitched on to become the Premier League’s all-time most booked player, and the first to reach a century, by the end of this season – if not sooner.

The former England midfielder was lucky not to get sent off for a clumsy challenge on Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez a few minutes after getting carded for blocking Leonardo Ulloa.

The yellow he did get was the 95th of his career, now just two behind Paul Scholes and four off joint record holders Kevin Davies and Lee Bowyer.

3. Kieran Richardson has spent the last four years of his career at either left back or on the left of midfield but Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert found a new job for him at Stoke.

The 29-year-old played just behind the centre forward, and not only blotted Stephen Ireland out of the game but set up a chance that Gabby Agbonlahor should have put away.

Richardson hasn’t played in a central role since he first moved from Manchester United to Sunderland – when Lambert’s new No 2 Roy Keane was the boss.

4. Sam Allardyce is under instructions to deliver a less direct style of play at West Ham and he’s clearly following orders – despite the disappointment of losing to Tottenham.

Hammers attempted 483 passes against Spurs, 150 more than they did in the same fixture at Upton Park last season. Their average number of passes per game last term was just 325.

5. Morgan Schneiderlin continues to be linked with Tottenham and made little secret of his desire to follow former Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino to White Hart Lane.

But the French midfielder’s performance at Liverpool made sure that, in the meantime, he couldn’t be accused of failing to give his all to Saints.

Schneiderlin ran 7.7 miles in the game, more than half a mile more than any other player involved at Anfield.

6. Vincent Kompany was Manchester City’s key defender away from home last season and it doesn’t look as if this year will be too much different.

The Belgium skipper made a series of blocks and tackles to help City keep a clean sheet at Newcastle as around him Gael Clichy and Martin Demichelis didn’t always look comfortable.

City will worry that a hangover from the World Cup gives Kompany no fitness issues. Last season they took just four points from five away games he missed, compared with 30 from the 14 in which he played.

7. Billy Sharp could be a bargain replacement for £11million Ross McCormack at Leeds after marking his debut following a £450,000 move from Southampton with the winner against Middlesbrough.

Sharp could feel hard done by for never getting a chance at Saints despite scoring nine in 11 starts after a £1.8m move from Doncaster in 2012.

The 28-year-old still scored an average of a goal every three games in loan spells at Forest, Reading and back at Doncaster and his career record remains a goal in every two starts.

8. When Steve Coppell took Reading into the Premier League for the first time in 2006 the club’s chairman Sir John Madejski insisted that a large chunk of the TV cash was invested in building the club’s Academy facilities.

Eight years later the decision is paying dividends. Jake Taylor, who got the winner against Ipswich, was one of 12 players in manager Nigel Adkins’ 18-man squad who have come through the system.

9. Striker Joe Garner has been struggling to reach agreement over a new contract at Preston despite top scoring last year with 24 goals.

With a year to go on his current deal, and other clubs monitoring the situation, he did his case for a pay rise no harm by scoring twice in the 4-0 victory at Scunthorpe.

That already takes him to three goals in two League One matches, as his agent will no doubt be pointing out to Deepdale chairman Peter Ridsdale.

10. Nigel Worthington’s York players need to learn that the game lasts longer than 90 minutes these days.

Marc Richards’ injury time free kick that snatched a point for Northampton was the third time in as many games in a week that York had thrown away a game by conceding late on.
