Control: A new mobile service is promising parents total control over how their children use their phones, from the websites they visit to the times of day the handset is on

Parent will soon be able to read their children’s text messages, control who they speak to and turn their phones on or off – no matter where they are.

A new mobile service is promising mothers and fathers total control over how their children use their phones, from the websites they visit to the times of day the handset is on.

Mobile phone company Bemilo has created the service, which will run on the Vodafone network, to appeal to parents worried about text bullying, sexting and the disruptive use of phones in schools.

Campaigners say the phone deal, which is intended for children between eight and 16, hands power back to parents.

The move follows the Daily Mail’s campaign for internet service providers to protect children by automatically blocking access to pornographic content, with adults having to ‘opt in’ if they want to view sexual material.

Until now, any restrictions on children’s mobile phone use have had to be made using the parental control options on the handset itself.

These settings can be difficult and time-consuming to negotiate, and many parents do not know they exist.

Parents signed up to Bemilo’s system, however, can set restrictions for their child’s phone using a web page that only they can access.

The site is linked directly to the phone’s SIM card, so if a child wants to add a friend as a contact they have to ask the parent, who can then use the website to decide whether or not to allow the change.

Pleased: Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute, said 'parents have been wanting something like this for a very long time'

All messages that are sent and received by the child can be viewed by the parents by logging on to the site, even if the child deletes them from the phone.

Parents can also set a timer so that the phone cannot be switched on during lessons or late at night, for example. However, calls to the parents’ phones can be made at all times.

The pay-as-you-go SIM cards are available from Bemilo’s website from today and from Carphone Warehouse later this month, with the parental control service costing from £2.95 per month.

Campaigners are now calling on other phone networks to introduce similar services.

‘Parents being able to read texts means if bullying is going on they will be alerted straight off and can deal with it straight away.

'Now we need a joined up effort across all networks and all industries.’ 

Bemilo founder Simon Goff said: ‘Unlike an app, Bemilo’s SIM will work on any mobile device or tablet, and most importantly cannot be bypassed by the child.’

But Nick Pickles, director of privacy group Big Brother Watch, warned: ‘Giving parents the tools to control what their kids can do with smartphones is a good thing, but this is a step too far.

‘If there are problems with what young people are using their phones for the way to fix them is not to have parents spying.’

Facebook is considering lifting a ban on children using its site – despite fears it could put youngsters at risk of bullying or grooming by sexual predators.

The site, which has 900million active members worldwide, does not allow under-13s to join.

But the company's head of policy in Britain, Simon Milner, said restrictions may be eased as many younger children already use the social network by lying about their ages.

He said: 'Some seem to be doing it with their parents’ permission and help.

'We have a strict under-13 rule because of legal issues in America. We apply the same rule all over the world.

'But actually a lot of parents are not only happy that their kids are on it, but they are helping them be on it.'
