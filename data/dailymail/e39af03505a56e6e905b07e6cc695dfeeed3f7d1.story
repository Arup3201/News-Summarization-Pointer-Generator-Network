Extradition: Calls have been made for an alleged henchman of Franco (pictured) to face trial

A man alleged to have been a torturer under the brutal fascist dictatorship of General Franco's Spain has been discovered living a quiet life in Madrid.

Antonio Gonzalez Pacheco, known as 'Billy the Kid' for his habit of spinning a gun around his finger as he beat his victims, is wanted by Interpol and has been accused of torturing members of the republican opposition.

He is said to have been particularly sadistic during Franco's regime, even allegedly telling his victims how much he was enjoying hurting them.

After Franco's death in 1975, Pacheco joined the police's anti-terrorism unit, helping to fight the Basque separatist group, Eta.

He then went on to work for a private security firm, where he is said to remain employed to this day.

A photograph published by newspaper El Mundo on Sunday showed the alleged henchman taking part in the Madrid half marathon in 2010.

He was wearing the traditional black and red colours of Spain's fascist Falange party.

In an article in The Guardian, it was claimed Pacheco regularly runs marathons in Spain and Budapest, and had even flown out to attend the New York Marathon.

Last month Argentine judge Maria Romilda Servinie de Cubria called for his extradition, along with three other men who were also accused of carrying out Franco's dirty work.

She was responding to a petition from his alleged victims' lawyers in Spain.

While two of his co-accused are now 
dead, Gonzalez Pacheco and another former police officer, Jesus Munecas 
Aguilar, could be summoned over the extradition request.

Gonzalez Pacheco has now gone into hiding.

Pressure is now growing on Spain to address the crimes committed under Franco's regime, which lasted for 36 years.

Last week a UN delegation called for a public investigation.

Warrants were issued for Gonzalez Pacheco and his compatriots under an international law allowing human rights abuses to be investigated and tried elsewhere if the country in which they occurred did not investigate.

The same law was used in the case of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998.

In the case involving Gonzalez Pacheco, the alleged victims went to Argentina after failing to get anywhere in Spain, where an amnesty was passed in 1977 preventing trials for any crimes committed before 1976.

There are believed to be up to 114,000 bodies buried across the country - the victims of atrocities committed under the regime.

A further 30,000 children were taken from their parents, many of whom have never been found.

Lawyer acting for the claimants, Carlos Slepoy, said: 'Spain runs the risk of becoming a refuge for criminals if it refuses to investigate these crimes here, and does not allow Argentina to.'

A Spanish ministry of justice spokeswoman promised to study the case documents as soon as they had been received from Argentina.

Brutal: The Fascist general was to rule Spain with an iron grip for 36 years

The Spanish Civil War is considered a watershed moment in 20th century European history because it tipped the balance of power in favour of the Fascist movement.

In 1929 the military dictatorship that had been ruling Spain collapsed. Two years later the King of Spain abdicated when the left-wing Republicans came to power.

It set in motion a bitter battle for power that was to be played out in the deeply divided country over the next seven years.

When the army rebelled in 1936, the country slipped into all out civil war, with the Nationalists, made up of landowners, business owners, the gentry and the church, on one side, against the Republicans, comprising the workers and peasants, on the other.

Led by General Francisco Franco and supplied with weapons by Hitler's Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Fascist Italy, the Nationalists had the upper hand.

Although the Republicans were assisted by Communist Russia, they did not receive the same level of support and were finally defeated in 1939, just months before the outbreak of the Second World War.

Britain and France had both signed a non-assistance pact preventing aid from reaching Spain, although they were powerless to stop Germany's help from getting through.

Many young inspired Brits rushed to help the Republican movement, with eminent writers George Orwell and Laurie Lee among them.

Franco was to rule the country with an iron grip for 36 years between 1939 and 1975 and survived the fall of Fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany after the Second World War. His regime had remained neutral throughout the conflict.

He effectively ruled Spain as a dictator from 1939 until his death, and brutally oppressed political opponents during that period, although the precise numbers of those who died or disappeared as a consequence of his policies is unknown.
