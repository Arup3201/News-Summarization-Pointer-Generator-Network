It's not called the silly season for nothing.

One bright spark in Townsville has risked electrocution by disconnecting a street light outside his house to add that extra twinkle to his Christmas light display.

Ergon Energy spokesman Mark Timmerman says maintenance crews were stunned by the man's determination to make his house super sparkly. 

A man has risked being electrocuted to death to make his Christmas lights shine brighter by cutting off power to a street light outside his home in Townsville, north-eastern coast of Queensland. Pictured is a house from Christmas comedy film National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

The recent incident draws similarities to the comedy film, starring Chevy Chase (pictured) as Clark Griswold - the father who shows the dangers of Christmas decorating

'Don't do it. It's stupid and it's dangerous,'  Mr Timmerman told ABC radio said.

'Of his own volition he's gone and disconnected the street light in the front of his home in an attempt to make his Christmas lights display stand out a little better in the dark.'

'We're not entirely sure how he achieved that. Suffice to say it's obviously illegal ... and it's a very dangerous thing to do.'

Mr Timmerman said crews had also found other examples of people tampering with street lights in the Townsville area, north-eastern coast of Queensland.

He said school-aged children had been seen hanging around light poles that were later found to have been tampered with.

He said crews had found three poles where the inspection plates had been removed, and in one case live wires had been left exposed.

'Why children would want to be trying to access wiring in street lights we don't know, but we've reported that to police,' Mr Timmerman said.
