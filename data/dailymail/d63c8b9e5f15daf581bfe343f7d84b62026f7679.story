The victim of a vicious acid attack which left her facially scarred for life has revealed she has started dating again - and that she is ready to find love.

Naomi
 Oni first hit the headlines in 2012, when acid was thrown over her face, head and body by her former friend Mary Konye as she walked home from work.

The devastating attack, which happened as she made her way through Dagenham, burned off the now 22-year-old's eyelids, eyebrows and some of her hair.

Looking for love: Naomi Oni, who was the victim of an acid attack two years ago, is putting her ordeal behind her and is ready to find love. She opened up in an interview with Closer magazine and had a makeover

She was left disfigured, and facing a court case against Konye, also 21 at the time, who was wearing a niqab veil disguise at the time of the assault - and who was jailed for 12 years over the attack.

Naomi, who was scarred for life, has revealed that catching sight of her reflection in the mirror made her feel suicidal - and thought that no man would ever want to marry her.

And she has admitted that, two months after the attack, her boyfriend at the time ended their relationship and she was left worrying that no other man would ever find her attractive again.

Since then, surgeons have painstakingly 
rebuilt her features and it's given her a new lease on life - so much so, she has even started dating again.

While her recent 
relationship didn't work out, Naomi explains that she and the man in question are 
still friends and that the relationship really boosted her confidence. 

Positive outlook: Naomi said that the man she was seeing looked past her scars to the person she is inside, making her realise the attack doesn't have to ruin her life

Speaking to Closer 
magazine about her date, Naomi said: 'He said I was gorgeous and 
completely took me by surprise - he approached me in the street and said
 he'd read about my story and thought I was so inspirational that he 
wanted to take me out.

'Things didn’t work out with the guy I was seeing and we’re just friends, but it’s boosted my self-esteem.

'I'm enjoying being single at the moment but I'm ready to fall in love again with the right person.' 

At the time of the attack Naomi, 21, described how, on her way home, she got off at her bus 
stop in Dagenham, East London, and felt a ‘presence’ before turning to 
see someone wearing a niqab.

She 
then felt a ‘massive splash’ as the acid was thrown at her, scarring her
 for life and disfiguring her face, dissolving her hair and eyelashes 
and burning her tongue as she screamed.

CCTV
footage obtained by police after the attack showed Konye following Naomi 
as she left her job as a shop assistant in Victoria's Secret in 
Westfield Shopping Centre, Stratford, East London.

Konye was sentenced to 12 years in jail in March, with Judge David Radford telling Konye her 'deliberate' and 'wicked act' had been devastating to Naomi in 
his sentencing at a London court.

Police and prosecutors had said Konye was jealous of her friend's looks 
and spent months hatching a plan for the attack following a trivial 
argument.

The court heard that Konye told a 
friend she planned to have her raped and wanted to disfigure Naomi, 
saying: ‘I’m going to mess up the one thing that girl has – her looks.’

Konye even went as far as to claim in court that Naomi had asked her to throw the acid over her in a bid to copy burns victim Katie Piper, who had acid thrown in her face in 2008.

Konye and Naomi had been friends since secondary school, but suffered a vicious 
fallout in April 2011 when Naomi allegedly accused Konye of texting 
her boyfriend and called her an 'ugly monster'.

Naomi says she is glad that her former friend got a long prison term but adds that it doesn't change what happened.

She told Closer: 'When I saw my 
face, I couldn’t stop crying. I thought, "Who’s going to want to marry 
me like this?" I felt so low, I didn’t want to live.'

Despite her ordeal, Naomi is set on pursuing a career within the fashion and beauty industry and is enjoying single life.

She added: 'The guy I was seeing looked past my scars to the person I am inside. It made me realise the attack doesn’t have to ruin my life.'
