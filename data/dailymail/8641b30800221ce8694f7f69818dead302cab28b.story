She may have been experimenting with her fashion lately - with varying degrees of success - but Selena Gomez embraces the laidback, boho style she's always worn so well in her latest fashion campaign.

The young star, who is a guest designer for the adidas NEO Label, has curated and modelled her latest collection for the range.

The 22-year-old has combined feminine fabrics with more edgy prints, toughening up printed lace with a skull graphic.

That's more like it! Selena Gomez, who has been stepping out in some racy and somewhat bizarre outfits lately, has returned to her boho roots for her latest Adidas campaign

Justin Bieber's ex has also added lots of on-trend denim, such as sleeveless denim tops and denim bomber jackets, to create the ultimate autumn city look. 

A spokesperson for the brand said: 'The new Selena Gomez collection is all about mixing it up and layering your items. It allows for trans-seasonal pieces which are perfect for layering, allowing you to tailor your wardrobe to the late summer weather as well as the chill of early autumn.

'To work a dressed up look, the colour palette of black and gold with dark burgundy tones will keep you looking stylish for a night out.'

Material contrasts, fabrics and layers of detail are key, while subtle tones of cream white and frosty mint paired with grey heathers, denim and black make up the colour palette.

The singer has also added a footwear collection to the range, which she designed to fuse street wear and city attitude.

The Selena Gomez Accessories collection is described as 'effortless chic' and is full of light scarves,  cross-body bags and denim clutches.

Booted up: The singer has also added a footwear collection to the range, which aims to convey a fusion of street wear and city attitude. Boots are priced at £65

There's plenty of warm accessories for the colder months and Selena showcases the cozy scarves and slouchy beanies with faux fur pompoms to perfection.

Tops are priced at £30, beanies at £13 and trainers at around £50.

Not only is the collection going to be in stores and online, you will also be able to see it on the runway in September in New York City, as Selena hosts the #NEOrunway fashion show.

This fashion show will be curated by teens around the world, by voting on several aspects of the show, like hair, make-up, music and outfits.

Earlier today, Selena looked a far cry from her cool and casual campaign self as she stepped out in a Where's 
Wally-inspired outfit, featuring a striped top and round-rimmed 
sunglasses.

Selena was headed out in Calabasas, where her ex-beau Justin Bieber owns a house.

The on/off pair broke up last month and have both been cavorting with new love interests since.

However,
 it has been reported that Selena doesn't appreciate his recent antics -
 getting into a fight with the actor Orlando Bloom, posing for flirty 
pictures with reality star Kylie Jenner and hooking up with Playboy 
model Alyssa Arce - but friends say she isn't affected by them either, 
as she is completely over their breakup.

A source told Hollywoodlife.com: 'Selena is beyond over Justin and his immature behaviour.

She knows 
very well that he is trying to make her jealous with all the pics he's 
been posting of him with other girls, including Kendall.

'But rather than making her feel hurt or making her miss Justin, it's backfiring. She's disgusted with how he's behaving.

'She's
 not hurt, she's actually grateful that she's not with him anymore. In 
her opinion, he's acting out and she would rather have nothing to do 
with him.'

Justin was
 involved in an altercation with 'Pirates of the Caribbean' actor 
Orlando, 37, at a restaurant in Ibiza last week and is said to have 
taunted him with the claim his estranged wife, Miranda Kerr, had 
promised to 'make him a man'.

Rumours
 of Miranda, 31, cheating on Orlando with Justin emerged in 2012 after 
the pair were pictured flirting at a Victoria's Secret fashion show.

Although
 she and Orlando - who have four-year-old son Flynn together - have 
since called time on their relationship, Justin's jibe is said to have 
prompted Orlando's swing for him.
