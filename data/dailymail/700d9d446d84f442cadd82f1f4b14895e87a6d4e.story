Anthony Weiner's latest online mistress Sydney Leathers may have been exposed to the HIV virus while filming her recent porn movie, it emerged today.

The adult film industry in San Fernando Valley in California announced a moratorium on the making of porn films on Wednesday after an actor tested positive for HIV - sending shockwaves through the porn industry.

The woman - who has now been named as Cameron Bay - revealed she shot her most recent sex scene with Xander Corvus, the man who played Anthony Weiner alongside Leathers in her porn debut Weiner And Me, released yesterday.

Cameron Bay spoke to Adult Video News to confirm she was the performer responsible for the moratorium on porn production.

Cutting Edge Testing lab told Bay on Wednesday that a blood sample drawn the previous day came back positive for HIV.

She told AVN that she was 'obviously extremely distraught and in 
disbelief', and that an additional test will be conducted to confirm the
 result.

According to Bay, she received her last clean bill of health on July 27.

Just days later she filmed an unprotected sex scene for a series called Public Disgrace. Her male partner was Xander Corvus.

Gawker reports he and Leathers also had unprotected sex for the Vivid.com movie.

Cameron Bay is not the porn star's real name. MailOnline knows her true identity, but has chosen not to print it.

Cameron has worked under names including Ashton and Ryder, but before she embarked on a career in porn she appeared on VH1's Tool Academy in 2009.

The show centers around couples who are sent to relationship boot camp in order to save their unions. The season ran for eight episodes, and Cameron along with her boyfriend of 10 years, Clarence - who had nicknamed himself 'Celebrity' - were eliminated in the third episode.

Just two years before her reality TV debut, Cameron spent a year and six months in prison in Arizona. She was released in May 2008.

She is also believed to have a total of 17 criminal filings against her.

In a statement to the site, Leathers 
said both she and Xander got tested prior to shooting their scene, and 
both were deemed 'healthy'.

However, the presence of STDs sometimes does not come up in tests for up to three months after exposure.

It
 takes the body two-to-eight weeks to make antibodies against HIV - 
known as the window period. Tests done immediately after the exposure or
 within this window period may not detect the virus and give a false 
negative result.

The CDC
 recommends that individuals who have been exposed to HIV and have been 
found negative before three months have elapsed get retested after three
 months.

Diane Duke, executive director of the industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition, told the Associated Press in an e-mail about the HIV detection: 'The moratorium will be lifted once the risk of transmission has been eliminated.

'In fact, since 2004 there have only been two cases of performers 
testing positive for HIV and neither of those situations involved on-set
 transmission,' Duke said.

'The current situation would bring the number
 to three cases in nearly 10 years, not just in Los Angeles but 
nationwide.'

The industry briefly put a similar 
moratorium in place last year after nearly a dozen performers were 
infected during a syphilis outbreak.

Word
 of the latest moratorium quickly drew critical responses from porn 
industry opponents. Among them was Michael Weinstein, whose group the 
AIDS Healthcare Foundation successfully lobbied voters last year to 
adopt an ordinance requiring actors use condoms in the making of most 
porn films.

'How many adult film performers have to become infected with an array of preventable sexually transmitted diseases â€” including HIV, which is not curable â€” before the porn industry actually complies with the law requiring condom use,' he said in a statement.

Since the ordinance's adoption, county officials have said they are investigating one violation.

Assemblyman Isadore Hall III, who is pushing for the state to adopt a similar law, called Wednesday's news 'devastating and preventable.'

'Exposing workers to this type of harm would not be accepted in any other industry in this nation,' the Los Angeles Democrat said.

The industry, which says its audience does not want to see condoms, is fighting the Los Angeles County measure in court.
