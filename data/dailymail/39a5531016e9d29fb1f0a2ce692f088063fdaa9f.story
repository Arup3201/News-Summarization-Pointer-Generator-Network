Bill Gates has conquered the worlds of technology and philanthropy but now he has tried his hand at creating a viral video.

The billionaire activist appeared on Jimmy Fallon's late night show to enlist the host's help in spreading the message of his latest analysis on the state of charitable giving by trying to get viewers to go onto his website.

With the help of shutter shades, funny wigs and some auto-tuning, Gates got his message across.

Helping out: Jimmy Fallon, whose show is known for their viral videos, paired up with Bill Gates to get the word out about his new essay on the myths hurting charitable giving

On the lead up to the annual conference featuring some of the world's wealthiest corporate giants, the Microsoft founder released a memo dispeling 'three myths' that he claims are holding back developing countries- that poverty is an endless cycle, foreign aid is a waste and saving lives leads to overpopulation.

In the essay, which has its own dedicated website, he writes: 'I am optimistic enough about this that I am willing to make a prediction: by 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world. (I mean by our current definition of poor.)

'Almost all countries will be what we now call lower-middle income or richer.'

Gates
 said around 70 per cent of countries will have a higher per-person 
income by 2035 than China does now.  Nine out of ten countries will be 
above today's average income levels in India in two decades time, the 
tech mogul also claims.

All for the cause: Gates took a Brady Bunch-approach to spreading the word about his site

However he admits that some countries 
will be held back by war and politics, citing North Korea as an example.
 Geography will also hinder certain nations like the landlocked states 
of central Africa. 

Despite his optimistic take on the world, Gates admits that inequality will exist in every region.

The tycoon bases his theory on statistical data which shows that in 1960, income per person in the U.S. was roughly $15,000.

By comparison, 50 years ago the average income in Brazil was $1,982, China $928 and Botswana $383.

Today,
 China's income per person has increase by eightfold and India's has 
quadrupled; Brazil's has gone up five times and Botswana has seen an 
incredible 30-fold increase in earnings.

The wealthy disparity has decreased in the past 50 years, seeing more than a billion people rise from extreme poverty

The Gates report points out that although the percentage of very poor people has dropped by more than half since 1990, there is still one billion people existing in extreme poverty.

With a lot of work still to do, Gates nevertheless says that there are improvements for people across the world which are undeniable.

He writes: 'There is a class of nations in the middle that barely existed 50 years ago, and it includes more than half of the world’s population.'

Bill Gates has donated $28 billion to the
 Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which funds projects across the 
world in agriculture, education and health.

The foundation is committed to improving the lives of people in Third World countries.

For example, across Africa, the Gates' foundation provides vaccine 
delivery and treatments for HIV, malaria and polio along with family 
planning and agricultural development.

According
 to a report by Oxfam this week, Gates and the other 84 richest people 
in the world now have as much money as the 3.5billion poorest put 
together.

The combined wealth of people including Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and the Koch Brothers has increased to $1.64trillion.

And
 the top 1 per cent of earners are worth $110trillion - almost half (46 
per cent) of the world's wealth, Oxfam reported on Monday.
