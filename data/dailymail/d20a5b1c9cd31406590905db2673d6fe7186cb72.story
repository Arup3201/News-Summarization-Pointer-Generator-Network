The remarkable story of how a free-falling wartime pilot was saved when the beam of a searchlight enabled him to locate his parachute has emerged for the first time.

Squadron Leader Barry Douetil plunged out of his blazing Lancaster bomber at 20,000ft and was horrified when he realised his parachute wasn't strapped to his body.

It was only when he hurtled for a split second through the bright beam of the German searchlight that he spotted it was on the end of a strap 10ft above him.

While still falling through the air in the dark, the 21-year-old managed to rein the cord in until he was able to put the parachute on and pull the release cord in the nick of time.

He landed heavily ten seconds later in a frozen field but escaped the 1944 near-death experience with just a dislocated shoulder.

He was picked up by the Germans and taken to the infamous Stalag Luft III camp just six weeks before the 'Great Escape' attempt by nearly 100 Allied PoWs.

The incredible wartime story will be told for the first time 70 years on by Sq Ldr Douetil's son when he appears on BBC1's Antiques Roadshow this weekend.

Philip Douetil, from Pirbright, Surrey, took along to the show a poignant photo of his late father with the rest of his Lancaster crew, five of whom died in the crash.

He also presented experts with a written account his father gave of his own great escape that took place over Hannover on the night of February 19, 1944.

Sq Ldr Douetil was on his 14th bombing mission to Leipzig in eastern Germany when the Lancaster was attacked by a Focke-Wulf 190 nightfighter plane.

In his own words, Sq Ldr Douetil said: 'Cannon shells hit the starboard wing setting it alight. I could feel the impact of the hits through my hands on the control column.

After landing heavily and dislocating his shoulder following his incredible plunge from 20,000ft, Squadron Leader Barry Douetil ended up a prisoner of war in the infamous German camp Stalag Luft IIIG. The telegram pictured, was sent to his parents' home in Surrey, confirming that he had been captured

'I could also hear the noise of the flames above the noise of the engines.

'Sgt John Gill, flight engineer, undid the seat belt and attached a chest type parachute onto my harness.

'A short while later the aircraft rolled onto its back and I fell onto the cockpit canopy, together with the flight engineer, which seemed to give way.

'I found myself falling rapidly in the darkness at about 20,000ft.

'It was cold and breathless, but I could still hear the noise of the bomber stream. Judging by some revolving lights, I must have been in a tumble.

'On reaching for the parachute ring, I discovered my pack had disappeared - no parachute! I assumed it had been torn off.

The final entry to Squadron Leader Barry Douetil's log book. A number of archives from the late pilot's war time collection are due to appear on Antiques Roadshow while his son Philip is set to recount the incredible story

'Somewhile
 later, against some light from searchlights, I saw the oblong shape of 
the parachute, unopened and still attached to the harness.

'As soon as I saw this, I pulled it up/down/sideways and towards me then found the D ring and pulled, the parachute opened!

'I landed heavily in a frozen ploughed field, on the outskirts of Hannover, with a dislocated left shoulder.'

Philip
 Douetil, 66, said: 'My father later told me that he was probably 
falling through the air for about five minutes and pulled the parachute 
open 10 seconds before he hit the ground.

'It
 was only because he went through the beam of the searchlight for a 
split second that he realised the parachute was still attached to him 
and he had the nowse to put it on despite free-falling to the ground.

'He was very reluctant to talk about it, until the latter part of his life when I made him write down his experiences.

'I think he probably just felt a degree of guilt about the loss of his crew when he survived.

'Up until now it has just been the family who knew about it.'

Philip Douetil is set to recount the remarkable story of how his father leapt from a Lancaster bomber, found the parachute that was trailing by a cord above him, strapped himself in in mid air and landed in a field in Germany - suffering only a dislocated shoulder

 JA862 crashed near Langenhagen Airfield. Engineer F/Sgt John Gill, bomb
 aimer F/Sgt William McMillan, wireless operator Pilot Officer Basil 
Cude, gunner F/Sgt Bernard Sparkes and gunner Flying Officer Frederick 
Hale were all killed.

Flight
 Sergeant Fred Price, the navigator, successfully bailed out of the 
doomed aircraft only to later be fatally wounded by the friendly fire of
 an American plane when a column of marching PoWs were mistaken for 
Germans.

After the war Sq Ldr Douetil left the RAF and spent the rest of his career working in the insurance industry.

He and wife Margaret had three children; Philip, 66, Paul, 61, and Richard, 58, and he died aged in his late 70s.

Mr Douetil also took along to the Antiques Roadshow his father's RAF logbooks and two telegrams sent to his parents recording him as missing and then found.

Squadron Leader Barry Douetil wrote a detailed account of the dramatic fall over Hannover in 1944. The story has remained within the family until now

Squadron Leader Douetil's own great escape took place over the German city of Hannover. But the same city, pictured here in 1945, would go on to sustain severe damage after a wave of Allied bombing campaigns

He also presented Roadshow expert Graham Lay with an instrument panel for a Lancaster bomber that Mr Douetil bought in honour of his father.

Mr Lay tells Mr Douetil: 'That's an astonishing story. It really is one of the best WW2 stories we have heard.

'The object (the instrument panel) almost doesn't matter.'

The story is to be told on this Sunday's Antiques Roadshow.
