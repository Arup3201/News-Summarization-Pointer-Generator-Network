Andy Murray was forced to defend the decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo as his coach after negative comments from fellow British Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade.

On the eve of beginning his title defence, Murray extolled the virtues of Ivan Lendl’s replacement, dismissing Wade’s observations that he was ‘messing with everyone’ in making the appointment and that Mauresmo was ‘mentally fragile’.

Asked if he was disappointed with another British tennis icon offering such criticism he replied: ‘No, she’s done it a few times before with me. It doesn’t surprise me.’

No problem: Andy Murraym who hit the All England Club practice courts on Sunday, has defended his appointment of Amelie Mauresmo

Hitting out: Wimbledon legend Virginia Wade has been critical of Murray's decision to hire Mauresmo

Wade has expressed disapproval of Murray’s on-court demeanour in the past. As for her opinion of Mauresmo, she was probably expressing a view that others share but have been afraid to voice.

The bottom line is that only Murray can judge if the French former world No 1 is the right person to work with him, and he emphasised that the initial phase of their relationship had gone well.

‘She struggled with nerves and conquered them later in her career,’ he said.

‘Someone like that can help more than  someone who hasn’t had those issues. You can talk about her accomplishments — she was No 1 in the world, she won multiple Grand Slams, she had a creative game style. She’s very easy to communicate with and she’s firm. Those are the reasons I wanted to give it a shot.’

Murray said he did not know how he would feel stepping on court to face Belgium’s world No 104 David Goffin as he tries to avoid the fate of Lleyton Hewitt, who in 2003 was the last men’s defending champion to go out in the first round.

‘I haven’t spoken to Lleyton,’ said Murray.

‘The only person I’ve spoken to about it is  Amelie, but I’m aware that when I walk on court there’s going to be pressure. That’s why when I woke up there were butterflies, but that’s a good thing.’

The traditional champion’s Sunday press conference was not a particularly straight-forward affair, and Murray studiously avoided being drawn by the now-customary attempt to goad him into saying something controversial about the England football team.

Such associated pressures aside, it is potentially a very awkward match as Goffin is better than his ranking suggests. He has a decent game for grass and can lift his game against better opponents.The 23-year-old Belgian was in confident mood as he contemplated inflicting more misery on our sporting nation.

High hopes: Belgium's David Goffin is hoping to provide an early upset when he takes on Murray on Centre Court

‘I saw England is out of the World Cup, I saw that England lost to New Zealand at rugby — so maybe in tennis it will be the same,’ he said.

‘It’s the first time I’ve played on Centre Court and it will be an honour to open the tournament. I played against Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros last year and played Roger Federer there. I’ve played Tomas Berdych at the US Open.

‘Usually, I use the pressure and the emotion to play a good match and hope it will be the same against Andy.’

Goffin also sees an omen in what was achieved 12 months ago by fellow Liege resident Steve Darcis, who beat Rafael Nadal in the first round.

‘He had that small chance and he took it. Maybe I can do the same this year against Andy,’ said Goffin.

‘Myself and Steve speak a lot although we haven’t spoken about my draw yet. We’ll do that tonight.

‘What he did gives me encouragement. If he can do it then why can’t I? If I have a small opportunity and Andy is a little bit tight you never know. I have nothing to lose. I have been at 42 in the world; my goal is to get back in the top 50 this year.’

The women’s champion, Marion Bartoli, was also back at Wimbledon — a year after Mauresmo helped coach her to the title. ‘Everyone brings a little one or two per cent to the table,’ said Bartoli.

‘Amelie gave me the extra confidence boost that I really needed.’

Bartoli, who admitted that a legacy of her tennis career is that she now struggles to lift her right arm due to shoulder damage, explained: ‘Sometimes just knowing I could win was what I was lacking. Amelie makes you feel very comfortable in a difficult situation.’

If Murray gets off to a slow start against Goffin, that is exactly the place where he may find himself.
