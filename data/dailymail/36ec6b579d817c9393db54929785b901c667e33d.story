Questions emerged today over the reasons behind the departure of ITV weathergirl Sian Lloyd from the channel after 24 years.

Ms Lloyd, who at 56 was Britain's longest-serving female forecaster, has not presented the ITV weather since February.

Despite having done the job for the broadcaster since 1990, the year after the ITV National Weather Service was created, she left quietly and without any announcement.

Why did she go?  Sian Lloyd, 56, quietly left her job of 24 years presenting the weather for ITV in February

That same month, she wrote an online blog about ITV's weather service commenting on 'this age of blatant lookism' in the world of television. 

Viewers have taken to online forums to ask what has happened to the popular presenter.

One wrote:'Any ideas where Sian Lloyd has vanished to? 

'She hasn't been on ITV for around six months now but is still very active on her weathergirl website. 

'Perhaps long term sabbatical? Or has she left ITV altogether?   

Another questioned whether ageism was an issue, with one writing on a popular television forum: 'Surely this is not an ageism issue?

'I would have thought senior and experienced presenters would be just what a broadcaster would want, not kids fresh out of school.' 

In February, the month Ms Lloyd left her weather job at ITV, the Welsh star wrote a blog for Huffington Post that now reads like a swansong for her career at ITV.

Paying tribute to veteran presenters Martyn Davies and Alex Hill, she wrote: 'They taught me so much...' 

Ms Lloyd had a well-publicised engagement with Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, right, which ended in 2006

'In this age of blatant lookism, they were totally themselves.

'They had no interest in polishing their egos, only in focusing on delivering the most accurate forecast possible...

'ITV will never see their likes again. 

'As a compatriot of mine once sang: Those were the days my friends...'' 

In an article written a couple of years previously, Lloyd referred to herself as a 'survivor' in a world where ageism was 'prevalent', and insisted she would work 'til I drop'.

She wrote: 'There is no doubt that ageism is prevalent in TV, way more so than in society at large.

'As for me, I intend fighting fire with fire and working till I drop. I shall be happy when they start calling Michael Fish a Weather Boy, and when they dare put a female with as big a belly as Bill Giles on the National Weather.'

Her heyday: Ms Lloyd, pictured presenting the weather in 1999, became a popular and experienced presenter

Today, a spokesman for ITV was quick to deny that Ms Lloyd's departure from ITV had anything to do with her age.

He said: 'As both ITV and Sian have stated, she has moved on to pursue new opportunities. 

'To claim that her departure has anything to do with her age is complete nonsense.'

Ms Lloyd's agent Seamus Lyte told MailOnline that Ms Lloyd, who was engaged to Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik before marrying motor-racing entrepreneur, Jonathan Ashman in 2007, had 'moved on'.

He said: 'Sian has been busy filming for a number of shows on ITV, BBC and S4C and doing a number of corporate and charity related events so that has been keeping her very busy. 

'S4C and BBC Scotland are also working with Sian.' 

Ms Lloyd has been happily married to motor-racing entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman, pictured, since 2007

He added: 'Sian has been a long-standing Met Office presenter, and is now moving on from presenting the weather on ITV, after more than 20 years to pursue these opportunities.'

But Mr Lyte did not respond to questions over whose decision it was for the veteran weathergirl to leave ITV, or whether her age had been a contributing factor.

Ms Lloyd also runs her tvweathergirl.com website and does corporate work.
