It was the easiest shopping bill to add up, with everything from a Toblerone chocolate bar to a pack of batteries costing only £1.

But a price war against an even cheaper rival has forced the aptly named Poundland to break its own rules and start charging 97p in some of its shops.

The cuts are designed to compete with the growing 99p Stores chain, which makes much of the fact that its products ‘cost less than a pound’.

Poundland boss Jim McCarthy said they were trying to 'pop the balloon' of their rival

Poundland has introduced the 97p standard price at three of its shops so far – East Ham in London and two in the West Midlands, Dudley and Chelmsley Wood.

The price drop strategy also includes offering shoppers vouchers promoting ‘two for £1’ or £1 off when they buy six items.

Chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ‘It is those early weeks when a rival opens that are very important and if you can pop the balloon early we find that doing that rather than nothing at all is helpful. And it sends the message that we’re not a soft touch.’

He said the 400-store retailer chose to slash prices to 97p because it was ‘attractive’  to customers.

The promotion has been running at the Chelmsley Wood Poundland for more than a year, but it is not clear whether the move is permanent.

Mr McCarthy told Retail Week: ‘It’s a bit like when a
supermarket has a competitor opening nearby. They have hosts of tactics
to dampen the impact.’

The 99p Stores group, founded in 2001, has grown rapidly amid the squeeze on cost of living and now has more than 200 stores.

Poundland is preparing to launch overseas on the continent for the first time. McCarthy said the retailer, which has over 22 stores in Ireland under its Dealz fascia, has chosen which country it will launch in but would not name the location.

The 99p Stores group, which was founded in London in 2001 by Nadir Lalani and his sons, has been growing rapidly against the background of the cost of living squeeze.

It now has more than 200 stores selling everything from furniture polish to chocolate.
