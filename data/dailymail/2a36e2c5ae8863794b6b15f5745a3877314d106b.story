This is the incredible moment two angry stags locked antlers and became submerged underwater as they brawled in a river over territory.

Photographer Mark Ollett captured the moment the two animals began fighting, after one of the stags entered the other's territory at Bushy Park in Hampton, Middlesex.

The wildlife photographer said the stag was the only male in a group of 24 females and saw the move as a challenge to his authority.

Photographer Mark Ollett caught the moment the two stags began fighting on camera during a trip to Bushy Park in Hampton, Middlesex

He said the two animals began fighting after one of the stags entered the other's territory. He said the antagonistic stag was the only male in a group of 24 females and saw the move as a challenge to his authority. The animals ended up locking antlers in a river in Bushy Park, Middlesex

Mr Ollett said: 'The stags fighting is a very unusual thing to see and just goes to show how strong the testosterone and aggression can be'

The animals fought aggressively in the park before becoming submerged in the river where they charged at each other with their antlers.

Mr Ollett said: 'The stags underwater fighting is a very unusual thing to see and just goes to show how strong the testosterone and aggression can be at this time of year.

'I have spoken to a number of other photographers and none have witnessed such behaviour before.

'They stood looking on from the right side of the stream, the second stag wandered over into the other's territory, he was unfazed by the first stag's aggression at first. I don't think he wanted to fight, but the first stag persisted.

'The right stag charged over to show off, not a wise move as not only did he end up losing the fight but also lost his females.

'He left the scene with his tail between his legs and the left stag walked off triumphant with the 24 females.

'He ended up losing more than pride that day.' 

The stags stood looking at each other before one of the stag's wandered over into the other's territory. The angry fight then ensued in the river

Mr Ollett said: 'He [the instigator] left the scene with his tail between his legs and the other stag walked off triumphant with the 24 females'

The triumphant stag roared victoriously as he emerged the winner from the fight. Mr Ollett said he had never witnessed anything like it before
