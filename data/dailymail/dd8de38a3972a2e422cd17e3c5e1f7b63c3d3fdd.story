Teetotal Daniel Radcliffe a no-show after the premiere screening

She started her night in a floor-length tiered Oscar De La Renta gown but Emma Watson ended it with a bang in a shorter Elie Saab frock at the Harry Potter premiere afterparty.

It was a night of celebration and emotion as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 afterparty kicked off at Old Billingsgate Market in London, but despite shedding a few tears at the premiere, Emma Watson held her head high as the night continued.

The actress, who plays Hermione Granger, appeared to have a glittering theme for the night and changed outfits for the afterparty.

And she sparkled like a diamond in both of her stunning couture dresses with a real rock to match, wearing a Boodles round diamond ‘Chakra’ platinum ring worth a cool £95,000.

The 21-year-old accessorised her Elie number with Chopard earrings and peep-toe heels, to add that little extra bit of magic to her ensemble.

She then changed into a third and final outfit for the night, consisting of a little black dress, to head back to her hotel.

Also letting their hair down at the 
afterparty were her fellow co-stars Rupert Grint, Tom Felton and engaged
 couple Bonnie Wright and Jamie Campbell Bower.

But Harry Potter's star Daniel Radcliffe was a no-show at the event, which saw Chloe Green and Sam Branson turn up for a celebratory drink.

Perhaps his lack of party spirit was due to the fact that the actor has given up alcohol, after recently admitting that the pressures on fame had made him dependent on drinking.

Round three! Emma Watson then changed into a third and final outfit at the end of the night, which consisted of a little black dress, trench coat and ballet flats

Looking sharp: Rupert Grint, who plays Ron Weasley in the franchise, looked dapper in his suit, while Emma Roberts made a special appearance in black and tan

Emma Roberts, Hollywood A-lister Julia's niece, also sneaked in for a special appearance and looked gorgeous in a black and tan knee-length dress.

Jonathan Ross and his wife Jane Goldman 
also joined the actors in their evening of celebrations and the Harry 
Potter fans arrived at the afterparty with smiles on their faces.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 premiered at Trafalgar Square yesterday and marked the end of an era for the cast and crew as they celebrated the last film in the franchise.

Emma, Rupert and Daniel Radcliffe, who grew up on the sets were hit with emotion as they paid tribute to the final film.

Miss Watson welled up as she and her co-stars thanked fans and each other for an amazing experience.

When Emma couldn’t contain her tears any longer, the film’s producer David Heyman offered her his shoulder to cry on.

Speaking with his co-stars, Harry Potter star Daniel said: ‘I don’t think the end of the story happens tonight because each and every person who will see this film will carry this story with them through the rest of their lives.

‘A huge thank-you to all of you, first of all for giving me a job and Jo for letting him give me a job.

‘Every opportunity I get from now on all goes down to the fact I got very, very lucky when I was eleven.’

Cheers! Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, Prince William's ex girlfriend, arrived with Sam Branson, while Matthew Lewis, who plays Neville Longbottom in Potter arrived with his girlfriend

Emma interjected by saying: ‘You didn’t get lucky – you were and are the perfect Harry and will be forever.’

While author J.K. Rowling told Daniel and fans that it’s not the end, seeing as the series will always live on in their hearts.

And Grint, who plays Ron Weasley, took the opportunity to thank the author for what she had done ‘for ginger people’ in front of the screaming crowds.

Emma said: ‘It’s overwhelming to try to find the words to say what I want to say, but I have been so privileged to play this role and be a part of these films.

‘I’ve had the most amazing 10 years of my life. Thank you so much.’
