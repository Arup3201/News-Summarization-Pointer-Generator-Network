A mother-of-three who lost all of her toes and most of her fingers is suing a hospital - claiming their mistakes led to the amputations.

Janet Garner, 49, from Signal Hill, California, claims that her  treatment at Duarte City of Hope Hospital following a bone marrow transplant in 2004 was negligent and led to the horrifying complications.

As a result, her attorneys say, she has had several parts of her body amputated and her legal team believe she may need several more because parts of her body, including her feet, will never be able to heal.

Legal action: Janet Garner, 49, from Signal Hill, California, claims that negligent treatment following a bone marrow transplant in 2004 led to some of her fingers and all of her toes being amputated 

Allegations: Horrifying images released by her attorney show her condition following the procedure at Duarte City of Hope Hospital. Lawyers claim she suffered the infection - pneumococcal sepsis - because the correct vaccines were not administered to prevent the spread  

Her legal team believes that if she had been given the correct vaccines after the procedure 10 years ago, it may have prevented her from developing the life-altering disease - pneumococcal sepsis. 

It is caused by a bacteria that then leads to an infection.

The vaccines, her lawyer claims, made Mrs Garner's blood pool into her organs but away from her fingers and toes - meaning they 'died'. 

Speaking at a news conference on Thursday covered by KTLA, fighting back tears she said: 'Everyday I wake up I still can't believe this has happened to me because I was so active and took care of my kids… went to work.

'This hospital gave me a bone marrow transplant and I really trusted the doctors.' 

Devasted: Holding back tears at a press conference, she said she wakes up every morning in disbelief because she used to be 'so active' and took care of her children

Future: Mrs Garner's legal team say what is left of her feet may also have to be amputated because they will not heal properly 

Attorney Moseley Collins said: 'The hospital and medical staff chose to ignore their own written procedures and did not give her the required pneumococcal vaccinations following the transplant.' 

'As a result, Janet developed pneumococcal sepsis which caused all of Janet's toes, many of her fingers, and parts of both feet to be amputated.'

The hospital released a statement saying: 'Providing the best possible treatment for all patients is City of Hope's highest priority. In observance of federal and state privacy regulations, we will not comment upon any individual patient.'
