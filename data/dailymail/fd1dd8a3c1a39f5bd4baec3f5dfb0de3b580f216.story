It isn't easy being the backup QB to Peyton Manning - just ask Brock Osweiler.

Hilarious footage of the 23-year-old being shut out of playing by the 38-year-old NFL legend was broadcast to a sympathetic nation on Sunday.

With the Broncos holding a 31-point lead over the Raiders, Osweiler excitedly grabbed his helmet in expectation of a rare start.

What?!! Osweiler turns to see Manning running out to marshal his troops - like he does every Sunday 

Oh man.........The realization that Manning will never yield to him, despite throwing the Broncos to a 31 point victory dawns on Osweiler 

However, in a split second his face becomes a picture as he turns to see the older man running onto the field causing him to raise his other arm in total exasperation.

At that priceless moment, Osweiler probably realized why Manning has in excess of 1,000 career touchdowns and is widely regarded as one of the best quarterbacks of all time.

However, it wasn't all that bad for Osweiler.

Probably protecting his ageing frame, Manning did let the younger man take to field in the fourth quarter.

However, whereas Manning finished with 31-of-44 completions for 340 yards and five TDs, Osweiler came on for two of five passes for a grand total of 13 yards.

Am I ever gonna get a go? Massive disappointment crashes over Osweiler's face as Manning seemingly ignores him

I give up! Osweiler is resigned to defeat as Manning stares down his offensive line and prepares them for battle

Can I have just one go...ever? Osweiler is a man defeated as some of his backroom staff turn to commiserate with him
