Fans of the X Factor have been given the chance to live like  the show's contestants after their former eight-bedroom home went on sale for £2,750,000 - just a month after the hopefuls moved out.

The detached house in Hadley Wood, Hertfordshire, covers a huge 6,400 sq ft over four floors and boasts a swimming pool, gym and a sauna.

It was put up for rent last year when it was snapped up by the show but after the 12 singers moved out in December the owner decided it was time to sell.

The eight-bedroom house in Haley Wood, Hertfordshire was previously the home to this year's X Factor contestants and has now gone on sale

There is a large swimming pool set amongst the landscaped gardens at the house which was put on the market for £2,750,000 last week

The home, which also has six bathrooms, walk-in wardrobes and landscaped gardens, has had famous faces such as judges Simon Cowell, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Mel B and Louis Walsh through its many doors.

Music mogul and father-of-one Cowell even celebrated his 55th birthday at the house, bringing with him close friend Sinitta. 

Its longest-standing residents were the final three contestants - Fleur East, Andrea Faustini and the 2014 winner, Ben Haenow. His single 'Something I Need' went to number one in the UK charts and become the second-fastest selling single of the year. 

Nick Staton, the agent handling the sale for Statons Estate Agents said: 'It's a beautiful house and when X Factor came round to look for a property they loved it.

'It was the perfect place for all the singers - it's the kind of place all the contestants aspire to live one day.They were fantastic tenants and looked after it really well. 

'The fact that it managed to house all of the contestants comfortably at the beginning of the live semi-finals give you an idea of how big it is.

'We've already had a lot of interest and because it is such a stunning property it is a pleasure to show people round. The luxury décor gives it a South of France feel.

'I wouldn't be surprised if we see some of the contestants back in a few years looking to buy a house in the area - they'll have such good memories of this house and it is famous for its celebrity residents.'
