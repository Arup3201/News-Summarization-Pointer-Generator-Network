The Wright brothers' first flight, the unveiling of Michelangelo's David and the Greeks' invasion of Troy - these are just some of the historic events that could have been shared with the world if famous faces from the past had used Instagram.  

The clever pictures were created by website Histagrams, which imagines how iconic moments in history might have been shared if the people behind them had been on social media users.

And the two men behind the site, designer Gavin Alaoen and an artist known as Gusto NYC, add comments and 'likes' that bring a touch of humour - and valuable historical context - to the photos.

 An image posted by Napoleon Bonaparte, shows tiny toy soldiers standing on a map of the world taken from a boardgame. 

The caption from the French Revolution leader reads: 'Planning my next conquest', to which a user name 'DukeofWellngtn' responds, 'Ha, see you soon lil guy!'

In an interview with petapixel.com in 2013, Gusto NYC said the idea came to him while on the New York subway. He said: 'Swiping through Instagram, [I] wondered what it would have been like if it was around 5 years ago, then I thought 10, 20 years ago, but why stop there?'
