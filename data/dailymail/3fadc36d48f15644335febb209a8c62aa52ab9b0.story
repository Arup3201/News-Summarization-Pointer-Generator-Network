She may be known for her fine, French elegance, but Carla Bruni made sure all eyes were on her by adding some very expensive Italian glamour to her look at a recent event.

Wearing a diamond serpent necklace worth £8 million euro, or £6.7 million, the former French first lady was in attendance at the re-opening of the historic shop of jewels, Bulgari, in Via Condotti in Rome.

The event took place following restoration works to mark the 130th anniversary of the prestigious jewellers.

Attending the event alongside actor 
Adrian Brody and model Poppy Delevingne, the Italian-born songstress wore a chic tailored navy suit over a black silk blouse with a
 plunging v-neck, which perfectly emphasised the iconic Bulgari design.

Swirling around her neck the incredible necklace is in the form of a snake, with the clasp formed of the snake's mouth biting the tail.

The mother-of-two completed the look with low heeled black boots and a diamond encrusted watch, and she added a splash of colour by carrying a bright pink leather clutch bag.

A former model herself, working for designers like Christian Dior, Givenchy and Paco Rabanne in her youth, Carla has a long standing relationship with Bulgari and starred in a stunning campaign for the brand shot by Terry Richardson in 2013.

The campaign saw Carla draped in luxurious jewels including a serpent design very similar to the one she wore last night.

Speaking at the time of her delight at being involved with Bulgari, she said: 'In a way, this fine jewellery house is already familiar to me. I feel connected with the romantic history and with its Italian soul which breathes life and joy and I sincerely hope to honour it.'

In recognition of their 130th year as one of the best jewellery houses in the world, Bulgari has donated 1.5 million euros to the city of Rome for the restoration of the staircase that connects the Piazza di Spagna with the Trinita dei Monti church.

Carla wore the stunning necklace in October when she attended another Bulgari party in Paris alongside a host of celebrities including Scarlett Johansson

Chatting with the Mayor of Rome, Carla looked relaxed and happy, showing no signs of the recent stresses in her life.

The 46-year-old was hoping to revive her music career after her husband, former president Nicolas Sarkozy, lost power in France a year and a half ago, but in January she was forced to cancel her planned tour of North America following poor ticket sales.
