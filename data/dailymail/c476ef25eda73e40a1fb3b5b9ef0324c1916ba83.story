David Moyes picked up his first point as Real Sociedad manager and provoked a touchline tantrum from Deportivo assistant coach Roberto Cabellud with his adversary storming down the tunnel after being sent off.

Sociedad hired Moyes to provoke a reaction and he got one from his team who gave a much improved display that so nearly delivered their first win on the road this season but there was also a reaction from former Basketball player Cabellud when Moyes suggested he calmed down 29 minutes into the first half.

Deportivo coach Victor Fernandez had upset the fourth official and when the referee came across to speak to the home team’s bench Cabellud said something and was sent off. When he walked past the Real Sociedad bench Moyes gestured with his hands for the former fitness coach to calm down at which point he approached the former Everton and Manchester United manager before being ushered away from the field of play.

'I don’t know [what the sending off was for] I was in my dug-out and he was in his dug-out. I don’t not what the problem was but he seemed quite angry about something,' said Moyes about the incident after full-time.

On the pitch Moyes’ first game in charge might easily have offered up all three points had his team coupled dogged defending with better finishing. Sergio Canales, Carlos Vela and Esteban Granero combined on 12 minutes only for Deportivo keeper Fabricio to save Canales’ shot with his face. Chory Castro then teed up Granero only for the former QPR man to fire over.

The visitors were not having it all their own way and Zubikarai saved well from Luisinho. They also grew in confidence in the second half but Real better than they have down so far this season and they still forced chances at the other end with Canales’ shot saved by Fabricio and Vela shooting just wide. Sociedad also had keeper Zubikarrai to thank for the point after he made a brilliant late save from Jose Rodriguez. They had earned their point throwing themselves in front of Deportivo shots late on to ensure Moyes didn’t go back to San Sebastian empy-handed.

It wasn’t quite the start of some of Britain’s greatest coaching imports. Bobby Robson won his first game in charge of Barcelona 4-2, Terry Venables won his 3-0 and Howard Kendall enjoyed a 2-1 victory on his bow as Athletic Bilbao coach.

But there was plenty about the performance to encourage Moyes who has only had a week to work with the players and was hit by injuries in the build up to the game.

He was without experienced midfielders Xabi Prieto and David Zurutuza. And central defender Inigo Martinez pulled out late with a bruised left leg.

As far as Moyes’ overseas predecessors in the Real Sociedad hot-seat are concerned a draw was as well as both Harry Lowe in the 1930-31 season and John Toshack in the 1985-86 campaign did. It was also better than the start made by Chris Coleman whose team lost 2-0 to Castellon on the first day of the 2007-08 season. He now has a full week to prepare for his first home game against Elche next Saturday.
