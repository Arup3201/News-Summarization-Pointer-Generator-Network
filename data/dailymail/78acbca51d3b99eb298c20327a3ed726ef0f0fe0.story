Considering the strength of feelings still against him, you might expect any day now to see the remains of the Sixties rail chief, Dr Richard Beeching, disinterred and dragged in shame round the streets of London.

For in popular legend, Dr Beeching is synonymous with the mass destruction of Britain’s rail network. Mere mention of his name triggers images of a mad axeman.

Last Saturday marked the 50th anniversary of the publication of his famous report, Reshaping The British Railways, which led to a massive programme of track and station closures. This lust to blame him for everything that is still wrong with our railways seems unquenchable.

It is 50 years since Dr Richard Beeching published his report but his legacy should be of saving the railways, according Keith McDowall, the Mail's former Industrial Editor

For example, the much-loved former Python star and TV travel presenter Michael Palin says Beeching left ‘a psychological and environmental scar unmatched by the scaling down of any other industry’.

The writer Matthew Engel argues that Beeching must carry the can for putting the knife to 24,000 miles of track linking the rural communities to our towns and cities.

Even at the time, the Labour cabinet minister Richard Crossman said: ‘Beeching is hardly a winsome personality. He makes every cut in a local service look like a piece of deliberate cruelty and any closure like an act of class war.’

Yet I knew Beeching well while working as the Daily Mail’s Industrial Editor. His image as a penny-pinching accountant with no understanding of this country’s rich railway heritage or of the needs of the travelling public could not be further from the truth.

I can honestly say that the portrait of him as a cruel, number-fixated bureaucrat is an absurd caricature.

True, his report identified 2,363 stations — one-third of those in the network — and around 6,000 miles of track to be closed.

Not surprisingly, his proposal sparked outrage from commuters, local councils and the trade unions, who were appalled at the talk of 70,000 job losses. There was particular anger in some major towns, such as Mansfield, where people feared they might be left without any rail link.   

Yet the truth is that Beeching was a courageous man who forced the railways to face up to commercial realities.

Contrary to what his critics pretend today, Britain’s railways were in a desperate mess. A modernisation plan had been introduced a few years earlier to reduce losses but had made little impact.

By 1961, when Beeching launched his commission, the network was losing £140 million a year — a staggering sum for that period. Battles between management and the unions were rife, and led to a rail strike in 1955 which lasted 17 days and so badly paralysed the country that the Government had to call a state of emergency.     

As chairman of the British Railways Board, Beeching bravely challenged this culture of waste and saw it as his duty to drag the railway industry into the modern world.

The truth is that whoever had been in charge of the railways, some sort of cuts would have been necessary.

Much of the equipment dated back to Victorian times, as did many working practices.

The Beeching report - The Reshaping of British Railways - has been criticised for 50 years

Beeching’s report set out in stark terms how nearly half of the nation’s 7,000 railway stations generated only 2 per cent of the total rail traffic, while one-third of the entire track carried just one per cent of the traffic.

Two-thirds of the rolling stock was not used all the year round. One extreme example of this under-use highlighted by Beeching was in Norfolk, where the line between Thetford and Swaffham carried an  average of only nine passengers on five trains a day.

The income from these journeys covered barely ten per cent of the route’s costs.

The railways were not just highly inefficient, but they were also facing serious competition from cars and lorries using new roads.

Petrol was cheap and as the country emerged from the period of shortages during World War II, more people found they could afford a car.

Increasingly this was the most popular form of travel, rather than families having to wait in dismal stations to sit on cold trains.

In 1938, there were 1.9 million privately owned cars in Britain, but the figure rose to more than six million by the time Beeching became rail chairman in 1961.

Beeching's legacy should be as a 'courageous' man who faced up to the unions, writes Mr McDowall

The M1 had just been built in 1959 and rail freight was severely undercut by the new road haulage industry.

Beeching had the guts to devise a coherent, workable scheme to rationalise the country’s railway system.

As he himself put it rather wistfully: ‘I suppose I will always be remembered as the axeman, but it was surgery, not mad chopping.’

Born in Sheerness, Kent, in 1913, Beeching went on to gain a first-class honours degree in physics from Imperial College in London and got a PhD for his research into electrons.

After working with armaments at the Ministry of Supply during the war, he embarked on a highly successful career with the chemical giant ICI.

His talent for management, allied to his analytical skills, brought him to the attention of the Government, and in 1961 the Conservative Transport Minister Ernest Maples persuaded him to become chairman of the British Railways Board.    

Immediately, Beeching was plunged into controversy — insisting he ought to be paid the same level of salary he had received at ICI, which was £24,000 (the equivalent of about £390,000 today).

This was two-and-a-half times the salary of any chief of any other national industry, and 35 times the pay of the average railway worker. It should be remembered, however, that in those days of soaring income tax, the state took a massive proportion of high earners’ pay.

In fact, Beeching told me that when he was hired for any speaking engagement, he usually asked for a box of good Havana cigars instead of a fee because the exorbitant level of tax meant it was hardly worthwhile being paid. As railway chairman, he set to work.

He ended all the excessive duplication and waste, which were a legacy of the network’s Victorian creation, and concentrated efforts on its core trunk routes, running trains at higher speeds between the main urban centres.

The under-used rural lines, sidings and goods yards were indulgences that could no longer be afforded.

Indeed, in some areas there was little for rural station workers to do on these routes apart from signalmen occasionally lugging at a lever to let an empty train go through — and then return to do a spot of gardening around their station box.

Beeching was a visionary as well as a rationalist. His most important contribution to revolutionising Britain’s transport system was how he predicted that, in the future, goods were going to be moved round the world as freight, in huge boxes, and that Britain risked being left behind by its foreign rivals.

The country was not going to need 30,000 dockers in London’s West India Dock, 10,000 in Tooley Street, Southwark, and 7,000 in Surrey Commercial Docks.

The work would be centred on massive ports such as Tilbury, Essex, where huge containers could be moved by cranes rather than by men. The same applied to the docks in Liverpool, Glasgow and Southampton.

The historic Bluebell Railway ran its first steam-train this month on the reclaimed line from Kingscote to East Grinstead after it was closed in March 1958 as part of the Beeching Cuts

So Beeching created new freightliner rolling stock and a new infrastructure of depots around the country to meet this demand.

Sadly, the National Union of Railwaymen undermined the effectiveness of the new freightliners by insisting, as a job retention measure, that there must be a guard at the rear of every train.

Journalists such as me pleaded with Sid Greene, the long-serving NUR general secretary, but he could not move his men to accept what Beeching had proposed.

Clearly, Beeching had picked up a poisoned chalice, but he did not flinch from his task.

He also cut layers of management, shook up a deeply engrained culture of set procedures and practices, some of which dated from the beginning of steam, and challenged the rail industry’s tendency to warn that any change would endanger safety.

Of course, Beeching was a convenient lightning rod to deflect unpopularity away from the politicians.

However, for all the blame heaped on him, he did not take the actual decisions on line closures. That was done by transport ministers in the Tory and Labour Governments of the Sixties.

The iconic train was back up and running 50 years on from Dr Beeching's report

Indeed, Labour’s Harold Wilson cleverly exploited public discontent with Beeching in the run-up to the 1964 General Election, but then when elected he did nothing to reverse the cuts and even pushed ahead with some closures that Beeching had never recommended.

But Wilson’s transport secretary Barbara Castle forced Beeching out of his job in 1965.

In fact, I organised his farewell lunch on his last day in the role at his favourite haunt, the then magnificent Great Western Hotel (now a soul-less Hilton hotel) in Paddington, West London.

It was there, in a secret room in the hotel, that he finally won agreement with the rail unions to face up to his modernisation programme.

What Beeching’s critics so often ignore is that in the long-term his cost-cutting was a success.

In contrast to most other parts of the Western world, Britain’s railways are now flourishing.

In recent decades, the network has enjoyed a phenomenal renaissance, with passenger numbers now at their highest levels since the Twenties.

Yes, there are plenty of problems such as overcrowding, but at least there is new investment going into the railways.

So I say ‘hats off’ to Dr Beeching. British management could have used many more like him in the Sixties to tackle the nation’s industrial decline and to create real jobs.

Come to think of it, if pioneers like Beeching had met with more success, we might not be in the economic mess we are today.
