A grandmother was arrested after squirting Fairy Liquid in her daughter's boyfriend's face

A grandmother is facing court after trying to wash her daughter's boyfriend's mouth out with Fairy Liquid because he was swearing at her. 

Margaret Gettings was charged last November after Robert Weekes,a 6ft 2in chef, phoned police in Newark, Nottinghamshire, to say she had assaulted him.

The 73-year-old had squirted washing liquid at the man's face following a series of rows he'd had with her daughter and granddaughter. 

Mrs Gettings could now face prosecution after pleading not guilty to assault by beating in Magistrates Court.  

'I put Fairy Liquid in my bag but never thought I would use it until he leant down over me and was cursing like a trooper,' the grandmother told the Sun's Andrew Parker.

Mr Weekes, 38, phoned police to report he had been assaulted, and officers attended the scene. 

'Officers attended an address in Newark on 16 November 2014, after the report of an assault on a 38-year-old man.

'A 73-year-old woman was voluntarily interviewed on suspicion of assault, and following CPS advice was reported for summons for the offence,' a Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said. 

Mr Weekes, who is thought to have since broken up with Mrs Getting's daughter, has since retracted his police statement and said he wants no further action to be taken. 

The Crown Prosecution Service is now deciding whether or not to move forward with her case. 

'It's finished my faith in British justice if they can waste all this time and effort on someone like me while murderers go free,' the pensioner added. 

In 2007, Jonnie Wiseman, a cab driver, was arrested for squirting Fairy Liquid at his girlfriend in a jealous rage. 

A CPS spokesman this morning confirmed Mrs Getting's next court date was in March but would not comment further on the case.
