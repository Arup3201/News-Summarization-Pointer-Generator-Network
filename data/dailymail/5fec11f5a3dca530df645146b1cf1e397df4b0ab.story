A scandal-hit hospital where all but the most seriously ill patients have been barred from accident and emergency is being investigated for fiddling waiting time figures.

Colchester General Hospital is only handling urgent cases after a surprise inspection found staff swamped by ‘unprecedented demand’.

And watchdogs were shocked to see a dead body being wheeled through casualty during the inspection.

The Care Quality Commission confirmed it will investigate allegations staff at Colchester General Hospital in Essex fiddled waiting time figures to meet four-hour target

In the past three days, 29 non-emergency operations have been cancelled – around ten times as many as normal.

The ongoing ‘major incident’ is likely to last more than a week.

A Department of Health source said the trust has suffered from long-term problems, stemming largely from weak management.

A review in 2010 also found that in four of the five previous years, Colchester Hospital reported higher than expected death rates.

Now health watchdog the Care Quality Commission has confirmed that during an inspection its team was confronted with claims A&E staff were faking records to meet the four-hour waiting time target. 

‘A can of worms has been opened at Colchester Hospital and there is a lot more waiting to come out,’ a source told the Mail.

The culture of highly paid interim managers at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust has also been criticised.

Former temporary chief executive Kim Hodgson was paid up to £95,000 for just ten weeks’ work – equivalent to £450,000 a year.

The CQC has confirmed it is investigating the alleged falsification of records.

The revelation suggests statistics which show one in nine patients wait more than four hours to be seen in casualty could be wildly inaccurate. Some 77,757 patients were treated there in 2013-2014, up from 76,338 the previous year.

It also raises the possibility of a culture of massaging figures after similar practices were uncovered in cancer care.

The hospital was put into special measures last November after a CQC report found the records of 22 cancer patients out of a sample of 61 had been altered to disguise ‘extensive delays for treatment’.

Gary Brigden (right) accused the hospital of robbing him of the chance to grow old with his wife Lisa (left, with her grandaughter Lilie Mae) after a catalogue of delays in her cancer treatment and a misdiagnosis

Police were asked to probe claims staff were ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ to alter waiting times.

The CQC carried out an inspection last Wednesday after receiving ‘information of concern’.

This led to the trust announcing a ‘major incident’. Only those with problems such as broken bones, heavy blood loss, chest pain and overdoses will be seen in A&E.

The inspection also raised concerns about the treatment of elderly and dementia patients, after reports of ‘inappropriate restraint, sedation and resuscitation’.

Roger Goss, from pressure group Patient Concern, said the allegations were ‘shocking’.

A trust spokesman said: ‘We are not providing a running commentary on the CQC inspection.’
