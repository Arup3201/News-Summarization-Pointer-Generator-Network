These are the shocking remains of a bus depot after a huge fire destroyed at least 35 vehicles.

The blaze in Summercourt, near Newquay, Cornwall, broke out at about 1am today and caused significant disruption to services in the middle of the county, including some school buses.

The cause of the fire at the Western Greyhound depot, which is not yet known, is being jointly investigated by Devon and Cornwall Police and Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service.

Police said the A3058 Newquay to St 
Austell road would remain closed for most of the day following the fire,
which destroyed a third of the company’s fleet and could be seen from 
ten miles away.

The fire, which is thought to have 
caused £1.5million worth of damage, saw several school buses and two new
double decker buses go up in smoke - which cost £100,000 each.

Western
Greyhound managing director Mark Howarth said: ‘A lot of hard work has 
gone into Western Greyhound and it's awful to see it going up in smoke. I
could just see flames leaping in the air.

‘When
I arrived all the buses at the bottom of the yard were completely 
ablaze,’ he told BBC Radio Cornwall. ‘The services will be significantly
disrupted but we will run as much of them as we can.’

Looking on: Nobody was hurt in the blaze, which saw fire crews from nine different stations sent to the blaze

'I was terrified. It was quite windy so the fire was spreading really quickly'

A police spokesman said: 'A large 
number of buses have been destroyed by fire which will impact on the bus
service provided in mid-Cornwall. The cause of the fire has not yet 
been established.'

The 60ft flames quickly leapt from 
vehicle to vehicle in the tightly packed depot, fanned by strong winds. 
More than 60 firefighters used water from a neighbour's swimming pool to
quell the blaze.

Neighbours awoke to see towering 
flames and feared for their lives. One, Kelly Broderick, said: ‘You 
couldn't tell which way it was going to go. It was big, there were 
explosions.

Mark Howarth, Western Greyhound

‘I was terrified to be honest. It was quite windy so the fire was spreading really quickly - thank God in the opposite direction to us. Once it had caught all the buses that were down there, the flames were enormous, 50 or 60ft easily with billowing black smoke. It was really intense.'

Incident Commander Guy Herrington, from Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service, said: ‘Because of the flammable liquids and materials in the buses, the fire took hold very quickly. It takes very little for fire to spread from one vehicle to another but to tackle this number of vehicles in one go is rare.’

Western Greyhound has been operating 
buses in Cornwall and Devon since 1998 and describes itself as a 
‘locally-based, family-run business’.
