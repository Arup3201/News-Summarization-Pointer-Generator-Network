Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has banned his players from having their cars driven to the Old Trafford exit gates - so they have to mingle with supporters and sign autographs.

The Dutch boss wants to improve fan engagement among his squad and his new policy recently saw Colombian striker Radamel Falcao ordered off the team bus to chat to eager fans who gathered in chilly temperatures at the club's Carrington training base.

Before Van Gaal's arrival, many of United's millionaire stars would have their luxury sports cars chauffeured to an exit behind a barrier close to the dressing rooms after home matches.

But the new manager has put an end to the practice - and now the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria have to walk through supporters to get to their flash motors.

A United insider told MailOnline Sport: 'The manager reckoned the players had come detached from the supporters and he thinks that the fans are the most important people at the club.

'The players used to jump straight into waiting cars and they'd be gone but that's all changed now.

'And it's not just at the stadium. At Carrington recently, the players were waiting for the bus to leave to take them to the hotel before a match and one of the staff asked Falcao to get off and go and sign some autographs for the punters who'd turned up. It's good to see.'

Newcastle's players looked in high spirits as they trained ahead of their trip to Old Trafford on Boxing Day

Third-placed United face Newcastle United at Old Trafford on Boxing Day looking to stretch their unbeaten run to eight league matches and Van Gaal, also known as a family man, has broken from tradition by cancelling training on Christmas Day to allow players to spend the morning with their loved ones.

'I believe in a total human being, the environment is also important,' the 63-year-old said.

'They are more pleased to be at home with their wives and children. Then, I hope they shall give everything to beat the opponent.'
