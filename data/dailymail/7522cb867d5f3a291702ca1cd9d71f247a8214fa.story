Former firearms officer Steve White took the helm of the Police Federation on a coin toss

For an organisation in turmoil over its hidden cash reserves, it was perhaps an inauspicious way to appoint a new chief.

The police leader tasked with shaking up the beleaguered Police Federation was elected after a dead heat in the race to be chairman was settled on the toss of a coin.

Just days after the scandal-hit police union was warned that it ‘must change or die’, former firearms officer Steve White took the helm.

Previously the organisation’s vice-chairman and an officer with Avon and Somerset Police for more than 25 years, he was voted as chairman despite a 50/50 split in the ranks over his appointment, leading to it being settled by a flip of a coin as dictated by Federation rules.

He replaces Steve Williams, who with its general secretary Ian Rennie, dramatically quit days after the Daily Mail revealed the organisation had hired a PR firm to mastermind a ‘guerrilla’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the Government in the wake of the Plebgate scandal.

The organisation, which represents 126,000 rank-and-file policemen and women, has also come under fire for mercilessly exploiting the September 2012 incident, involving the then chief whip Andrew Mitchell and policemen at the gates of Downing Street.

It has also been rocked by a series of crises over its bullying, obsessive secrecy and funding.

Those crises include undisclosed bank accounts containing tens of millions of pounds, vast sums invested in off-shore bank accounts and perks enjoyed by senior officials.

This week Theresa May heaped on further woe when she addressed the Federation’s conference in Bournemouth, and announced the removal of state funding this August.

The Home Secretary was met with stunned silence as she unveiled a package of measures to end automatic enrolment for new officers and allow the public to scrutinise its finances, warning that the body must end its closed shop culture or she would legislate against it.

Yesterday Mr White pledged to implement change.

He said: ‘This has been an historic week. We have been given a clear mandate to progress the reforms needed to better represent the hard working police officers throughout England and Wales.

‘We are all committed to the work needed to implement change to the Police Federation.

‘This is not the end of the road, it is the start of the journey.’
