Apple’s plans to take on TV with a live streaming box may have been pushed back until next year, but a patent has revealed clues about how it could be controlled.

The application details a digital remote, in the form of an app for an iPhone or iPad, that changes channels, browses menus and could be used to schedule recordings.

It would automatically connect to Apple’s set-top TV box, and unlike the current remote app, the patent shows a system that would work across phones, tablets and laptops.

It would connect to Apple’s set-top TV box, and unlike the current remote app, the patent shows a system that would work across phones, tables and laptops. It could be used as an alternative to, or as well as, the current control

The patent appears to show Apple following Google’s Chromecast lead, which can already be controlled using a range of mobile devices.

‘Many media devices utilise remote controls for browsing through and selecting content,’ explained the patent.

‘However, known remote controls are too simplistic and are not user friendly.’

Rumours claim that Apple's TV set will use a 4K screen, making is four times sharper than even current HDTV pictures.

The firm is also rumoured to be working with cable firms to allow it to show live TV as well as but films ans TV shows.

Previous reports claimed it would run apps, and work with an iPad or iPhone as a remote control, which has been given a boost with the latest patent application.

It may also include gesture controls, after Apple bought Israeli firm PrimeSense, or be controlled using voice. 

It continued that common remote controls are configured with up, down, left and right buttons, a selection indicator button, and maybe a keypad.

But this layout is mainly suited for browsing ‘old-fashion numerical list television programming’, said the firm.

Apple stated that a new paradigm exists for the way people browse for content, and text entry is now ‘very time-consuming when using a simplistic remote control.’

It also said that mirroring the display isn't a viable alternative, which is why it's proposing a digital remote.

‘Mirroring a display of a media device onto another display of another electronic device can result in the poor representation of the content.

‘For example, suppose a large screen television display can clearly display one hundred icons that are clear enough to decipher.

‘The same one hundred icons mirrored onto the small screen of smartphone would clearly be indecipherable.

Apple said controls (current Apple TV remote pictured left) are simplistic and not user friendly. It continued that many feature up, left, down, menu, select, right and play and pause buttons (labelled one to seven on the left-hand image), but this layout is suited for ‘old-fashion’ menus.

‘Alternatively, the smartphone could only view a small portion of the mirrored display at a time, but doing so is not user friendly.

‘Mirroring technology does not adequately address the need for remote browsing of content.’

The application was filed last year, but only awarded last week.

Apple sold more than $1 billion (£622 million) worth of Apple TV set-top boxes in 2013 and is investing heavily in the next generation of products, boss Tim Cook said at the company's annual meeting earlier this year.

The firm is believed to be working on a range of TV sets alongside an improved version of its current $99 TV box.

Future versions are expected to include apps and the ability to watch live TV as well as buy movies and TV shows. 

Previous rumours have stated that the new system may also be controlled by voice, similar to the way Microsoft’s Xbox One is controlled.
