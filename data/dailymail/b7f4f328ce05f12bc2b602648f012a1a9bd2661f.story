Men will always remember the look on their lover's face when they bent down on one knee - thanks to this ring box that secretly records your proposal.

The Ring Cam looks like any other ring box - but it has a tiny camera hidden inside, so loved-up couples can capture their special moment on film with just one click of a button.

The quirky invention was created by a group of five students from Hope College, Michigan, USA, for a class project before being launched in October 2013.
