Arsene Wenger is dreaming of Monaco and that is not entirely down to the romantic notion that he has yet to return in competition to the principality since leaving the club 20 years ago.

Monaco, one of six teams Arsenal can be paired with in Monday’s draw for the Champions League last 16, are struggling in the French league after selling James Rodriguez and loaning out Radamel Falcao.

Porto is another option he would take ahead of the other four: European champions Real Madrid, German champions Bayern Munich, Spanish champions Atletico Madrid or Barcelona.

‘We’ve never had an easy ride,’ said Wenger, who has been drawn against Bayern at this stage in the last two seasons and, in the two years before that, AC Milan and Barcelona.

Arsenal have not been past the last 16 since 2009-10 when they beat Porto before losing in the quarter-finals to Barcelona.

‘I don’t think many teams want Madrid,’ said Wenger. ‘We don’t want Bayern Munich and I’m sure they don’t want us. I’m not against Monaco because it would be a visit to my first home. I would love to go there.

‘I’ve got great memories of Monaco because they gave me a chance when I was a very young manager.

‘When I arrived they had never been past the first round in the European Cup so we have good memories. It is a fantastic place. That would be good.’

Wenger was in charge of Monaco for seven years from 1987, during which time he won the league title and the French Cup.

Arsenal defender Mathieu Debuchy said: ‘It would be great if we could wait a bit for Real Madrid or Barcelona. Monaco would be great. It would mean the boss goes back there and for us, the French players of the squad, it would be good to go home.

‘We need to have ambitions. It is great to have qualified for the last 16, yet again, but we need to look for more. A club like Arsenal has to go further.

‘We did the job by getting through to the knockout stages but it’s not finished. We want more but we know the games will be really tough now.’
