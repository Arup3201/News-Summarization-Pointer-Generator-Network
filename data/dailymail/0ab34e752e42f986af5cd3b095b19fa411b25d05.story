Pop star Kate Bush is under pressure to expunge paedophile Rolf Harris from her albums.

Fans of the Wuthering Heights singer want her to remove the sex offender’s contribution to three songs from any rereleases.

Bush’s musical partnership with Harris began in 1982 when she asked him to play the didgeridoo on the title track of her 1982 album Dreaming.

 The pair became friends and collaborated again on the chart-topping 2005 album Aerial when Harris performed the spoken role of the painter on the two tracks ‘An Architects Dream’ and ‘The Painter’s Link’.

But fans say they can no longer bear to listen to the tracks after Harris, 84, was found guilty of 12 sexual assaults against victims aged between eight and nineteen between 1969 and 1986.

They are now urging the Babooshka singer to ensure his contribution is kept off the albums if they are remastered or reissued.

One tweeted: “I feel they (the songs) have now been soiled, and I would like the chance to listen to these tracks without the input of Rolf Harris. “Maybe Kate will do this in future, she has been an avid supporter of childrens’ charities here in the UK (NSPCC springs to mind) so she may want to do this.”

Another added: “Rolf Harris made a significant contribution to The Painter’s Link and every time that track officially down loaded, Kate (via her companies) profits from it. That has to a very unwelcome association for Kate. Although she clearly wasn’t aware of Rolf’s criminal activity at the time the recording was made, she must be well aware of it now.”

Another fan simply said they would like to listen to Aerial ‘without having to spend time with a sex offender.’ 

Bush who will next month perform her first live concerts in 35 years was reportedly shocked when she heard that Harris had been sentenced to five years and nine months in prison for the attacks.

The star, 55, is believed to be planning to perform ‘An Architect’s Dream and The Painter’s Link when she takes to the stage for 22 nights at the Hammersmith Apollo.

Fans are also wanting assurances that the singer’s record label will not release a vision of the song She Moves Through the Fair which she is believed to have recorded with Harris.

A spokesman for Kate Bush who has sold out all 22 gigs was last night unavailable for comment.
