No contest: Cody C. Smith from Logan, Utah, would allegedly take the teenagers out for ice cream or watch a gilm with them before forcing them to go upstairs and have sex 

A former reserve police officer has pleaded no contest to forcing a 13-year-old girl to have sex with her four underage boyfriends on multiple occasions. 

Cody C. Smith from Logan, Utah, faces life in prison after refusing to dispute the charges of first-degree felony aggravated sexual abuse of a child.

The 40-year-old was arrested in March 2014 after a girl, then 15, went to police saying Smith had been forcing her to have sex with boys since 2011, when she was 13.

Logan's First District Court heard the teenage couples would go out for ice cream or watch films with Smith before he would apartment and force them to go upstairs and have sex.

During the act, investigators said he would continuously shout instructions through the door. 

On one occasion he is said to have bought one of the boys a condom. 

He was also accused of touching the girl's buttock and choking her until she was unconscious on several occasions. 

According to an affidavit seen by the Salt Lake Tribune, he told one of the boyfriends he should get her pregnant. 

After taking the pair out for ice cream, he then took them back to his apartment. The boy told investigators he was 'LDS and naive' at the time, so Smith allegedly entered the room and gave him guidance. 

The teen girl told police that the same scenario happened with three other boyfriends between 2013 and 2014. 

Two of the boys, who were both 16 at the time, told the authorities they went to Smith's apartment with the girl to watch movies before Smith would send them upstairs.

One of the boys reportedly had sex because it was 'late and a school night' and he felt it was the only way to get out of Smith's apartment

Suggesting the motivation behind the plea, Deputy Cache County Attorney Barbara Lachmar told the paper: 'I just think that the defense attorney saw the writing on the wall, that there was a substantial likelihood of conviction.

'It made a lot of sense that he would take a plea agreement. The victim is very young, and we were interested in protecting her.'

Horrifying: Logan's First District Court heard Smith would stand outside of the bedroom and shout instructions while they had sex. He is also accused of telling one of the boys to get her pregnant 

Defense attorney Susanne Gustin said: 'It is hard to overcome a case in which there is a parade of witnesses who do not know each other, all saying the same thing,.

'Cody did not want to put any more victims through the trauma of testifying. He made the right choice for himself and for the victims.'

Smith was originally charged in Logan's 1st District Court with ten felony counts of rape, object rape, forcible sexual abuse and aggravated sexual assault.  

After his sentencing, Smith asked whether he could remain free so he could get his 'affairs in order', but was taken into custody on Tuesday and will be held until sentencing on March 11.

He could get up to six years for each offence with prosecutors aiming to get him to serve them consecutively. However his defense team will aim to have them served concurrently.
