A top personal trainer has revealed that it is possible to get the supermodel-like gap-between-the-thighs look without resorting to cosmetic procedures or extreme eating regimes.

Following worrying news that the most recent catwalk shows have inspired teenagers and young women to turn to costly fat-freezing procedures and near-starvation diets to get super-slim legs, Matt Townsend says there are exercises that can make a significant difference to the inner thigh area.

'One of the most common questions I receive is how to get rid of inner thigh fat,' he told MailOnline.

'Though our body primarily burns fat as a whole and doesn't spot reduce, you CAN target which areas to emphasize a bit more.'

But while Mr Townsend's targeted 
inner-thigh workout may be healthier, it is by no means an easy option 
and requires some serious effort.

The Twitter users who admitted they would starve themselves to get the super-slim 
thighs of the models they saw at fashion week are not alone. The number of people using social networks to 
share 'thinspirational' images has seen a
worryingly sharp rise.

There are now Twitter and Facebook accounts 
dedicated to the 'thigh-gap' with more than 700,000 followers.

In another indication of interest in 
the 'trend', a top cosmetic surgery clinic in the UK said it had seen a 
240per cent rise in demand for a fat-freezing treatment on the 
inner thigh area.

Susan Ringwood, of UK eating 
disorder awareness charity Beat, blames the advertising industry and its liberal use of Photoshop.

She says: 'Hardly anyone has a thigh-gap without being underweight, or not yet fully adult, yet most 
of the adverts we see show grown women with thighs that do 
not meet when they stand upright.

'Our
bodies come in a wonderful variety of shapes and sizes - we 
need to be able to appreciate and admire them for what they are.'

One must do 12-15 reps of each of the five different exercises, which include squats, lunges and the terrifying-sounding Single-leg Romanian Deadlift.

On the plus side, they can be done at home as part of a daily routine, as like any workout, keeping it up regularly is key to its success.

The workout challenges the commonly-held belief that one must severely-restrict their diet in order to achieve slim upper thighs.

Indeed, the 'thigh-gap' first sparked 
controversy last month, when young fashionistas started tweeting that 
they were prepared to stop eating in order to get the slender legs of the models they saw on the fashion week catwalks.

The admissions were akin to the kind of worrying messages usually limited to the 'thinspiration' websites favored by those with eating disorders.

But Mr Townsend is adamant that a severe diet is the worst course of action.

'The goal is to effectively target 
the muscles so they are healthy and toned, not weak and frail,' he explained.

'So many 
of these girls think they need to starve themselves to get skinny. While
I agree that both dieting and genetics do play a role, much of the 
starvation aspects can be avoided with a clean diet and exercise.

'Not 
only that, you'll feel fantastic the entire time and be full of energy - it's a much more sustainable approach.'

Not only will these exercises help tighten up some unwanted areas, 
you'll also create a nice synergistic balance with other leg muscles and
burn lots of calories, says celebrity personal trainer MATT TOWNSEND. Perform 12-15 reps per exercise.

Squats: Hold your position for three seconds then return to original standing position

SQUATS

While standing tall with feet just beyond shoulder width, place 
dumbbells by your sides and slowly squat until your hips are parallel to
ground. Hold your position in the bottom of the movement for three seconds 
and return to original standing position. Be sure to not let your knees 
hang over your toes while lowering to the ground. Keep your shoulders 
pulled back and chest upright.

SINGLE-LEG ROMANIAN DEADLIFT

Stand with feet together and emphasizing your heel, hold a dumbbell or 
pair of dumbbells with hands slightly more than shoulder-width apart. 
Make sure your back is straight and abs tight, slowly lower the weight 
towards the front foot while raising the other leg behind you for 
balance. Once the weight reaches mid-shin level, push through the ground
heel to return to the upright position and squeeze the glutes at the 
top position. Repeat on opposite leg once completed with set.

GLUTE BRIDGE WITH MEDICINE BALL BETWEEN KNEES

While lying on your back with with knees bent and feet flat, place a 
medicine ball between your knees and raise your hips in the area to full
extension. Squeeze your glutes and hold hips in air for five seconds at a 
time. Squeeze the ball as hard as possible with your knees as this will 
help emphasize more inner thighs.

Lateral lunge: Squat as low as possible, holding that bottom position for three seconds

LATERAL LUNGE

Begin with stepping to the right beyond shoulder width while keeping 
your toes forward and your feet flat. Squat through your right hip while
keeping your left leg straight. Squat as low as possible, holding that 
bottom position for three seconds. Push back to the starting position and 
repeat on the other side.

WALL SQUAT WITH MEDICINE BALL BETWEEN KNEES

Squat with your hips parallel to the ground against a wall with the 
medicine ball between your knees. Be sure your lower back and shoulders 
are flush with the wall. Squeeze the ball between your knees and sustain
this hold for 45-60 seconds.
