Friends of a man who has been arrested five times for drink-driving have staged an elaborate prank in a bid to prevent him doing the same again.

YouTube prankster Tom Mabe, of 'MabeInAmerica', from Louisville, Kentucky, decided to take matters into his own hands when his friend passed out after his latest bender.

Using an office mocked up as a hospital theatre, and a team of actors who posed as medical teams, he convinced his pal he had been in a coma for 10 years.

Friends of a man who has been arrested five times for drink-driving have staged an elaborate prank in a bid to prevent him doing the same again

YouTube pranksters 'MabeInAmerica' (Tom Mabe and Jim Clarke) turned an empty office into a hospital room and convinced their mark (a friend of theirs who who remains nameless) that he had been in a coma for 10 years

They launched the prank after receiving a phone call to say that he has passed out in his truck

After filming the results he then posted the video online to discourage others from drinking and driving over the festive season.

After first asking his family for permission, he set up the room - including the 'doctors and nurses' - and woke his friend, the Huffington Post reports. 

He even screened fake news reports into the room as his baffled and still groggy victim wakes to the realisation he has been out cold for ten years.

As he wakes, a 'nurse' leans into him and tells him he is in hospital and that she is going to get a doctor, who informs him: 'Some time ago you were out drinking and you were in an accident. 

The pranksters transform the room into a hospital, with bed, telephone, and television so they can teach the man a lesson

Once they were told that he had passed out once again, they quickly enacted the plan.  After he was first transported to the bed, he wakes up to a 'nurse' who then runs to fetch a 'doctor'

'This accident took place in 2013. It is now 2023.

'You have been in a coma for the past ten years.'

He immediately asks for his wife and daughter, before he is told to settle down to watch some TV news - which include fake reports that  Miley Cyrus is facing eviction from a trailer park for 'refusing to stop defecating in her neighbour's yard'.

The doctor arrives in the room and tells him: 'Some time ago you were out drinking and you were in an accident. This accident took place in 2013. It is now 2023'

The confused man immediately asks for his wife and daughter, before he is told to settle down to watch some TV news

A second medical professional comes in, who carries out some medical 'tests' to see of he can feel his feet

He then moves to his patient's side where he begins to slap him around the head and shout: 'You have five DUIs'. As he does so, his mask falls from his face, and the man realises it is his friend Mr Mabe who has pulled the prank

It also reports that Justin Bieber is celebrating his ten year anniversary with his 'life partner'.

YouTube pranksters 'MabeInAmerica' have since posted the video online where it has already attracted more than 333,000 hits.

It may have been carried out in good humour, but the video creators say it is punctuated with a serious message.

The video ends with a reminder: 'Happy holidays, don't drink and drive.'
