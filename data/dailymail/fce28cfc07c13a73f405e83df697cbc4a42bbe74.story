This is the dramatic moment firefighters rescued a young boy clinging to a third floor window ledge in China after he was left home alone.

The small boy, who is believed to be around eight-years-old, had been left alone at his home in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, after his mother went to see friends.

The schoolboy obviously got bored waiting for her return and decided to climb out a bedroom window of their flat on the third floor.

Hang on in there: The young boy was spotted by pedestrians dangling from this third-floor window in Lanzhou, Gansu Province

Home alone: The child had been left home alone by his mother while she went to visit friends

But the child slipped and was then left trapped on a flimsy-looking drainage pipe.

He managed to cling on to a flat window while standing on the rain gutter for 30 minutes until passers-by spotted him and contacted firefighters.

Firefighters arrived at the scene then reassured the boy while they figured out the safest way to rescue him.

They had to break down the door to the flat before using the traditional method of pulling him up by his arms to safety.

Rescue: The boy is pulled by his arms back into the apartment by firefighters

Balancing act: He had managed to cling to the window for 30 minutes while he waited for help to arrive
