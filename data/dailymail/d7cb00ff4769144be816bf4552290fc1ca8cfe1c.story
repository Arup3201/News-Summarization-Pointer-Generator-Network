Rural villagers say they have been cut off by Royal Mail after a Post Office health and safety boss ruled their road was too muddy.

Royal Mail health and safety chiefs have ruled that the country lanes in the villages of Owensfield and Holtsfield near Swansea are too 'slippery and dangerous' and have banned deliveries in this area, following a
 complaint by a postman saying the trips are a 'muddy hell'.

Ray Laurence, 63, who lives in the area said: 'It is crazy that a bit of rain can stop the Royal Mail.

'It does get muddy in the winter, but it's no muddier now than in other winters.

Householders in the village of Murton, Swansea, have been cut off from mail deliveries because the roads are too 'unsafe' due to mud

Muddy conditions don't often stop the Royal Mail, which has a policy to deliver despite harsh and severe weather

'Delivery drivers from other companies had no trouble dropping off parcels before Christmas and our regular postman knows the route well, but this was a complaint for a relief postman.'

Laurence's neighbour Dai Morris, 64, said: 'I walk along the lanes every day and it is absolutely fine with a pair of wellies.

'Some people would rather see all the fields covered in concrete and tarmac rather than get a bit muddy.

'There's nothing more natural than the British weather.'

Ray Laurence who lives in one of the villages has been leading the campaign to re-instate the postal service in their area

A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We suspended deliveries after a postman reported that the path was 
extremely muddy and slippery as a result of the inclement weather.

'Deliveries
 were suspended following a visit by a senior health and safety manager 
after a postman reported problems walking along a muddy woodland path.

'Our postmen and women go out in all 
weather conditions including wind, rain, snow and ice.

'It is always a
 last resort if we decide not to deliver to a specific address or 
addresses.

'The safety of our colleagues is paramount.  We will only suspend deliveries if the safety of our postmen and women is at risk.'

Villagers are running a campaign in the villages to try and lift the ban.

This isn't the first time that the Royal Mail has not delivered due to complaints by postmen.

In June 2012, Royal Mail suspended deliveries during 'adverse wet weather conditions' after a postman slipped on algae and moss on the pavement and broke his shoulder.

In October of last year, a cheque wasn't delivered to a business owner because a spider the size of a ten pence piece was blocking the garden gate.

The weather conditions in the UK over the past winter have been some of the most extreme on record, with some places in Britain having an entire month's rainfall in the first week of the month.

When asked about the recent weather and affects to the Royal Mail's service 'Whereas the recent bad weather did not significantly impact Royal Mail’s service and network, it did cause some limited disruption at a local level – mainly due to flooding.

'The business is well accustomed to implementing contingency measures in preparation for and response to extreme weather events.'

Aaron Piper, a former postman, who delivered post during the 2012/13 winter, one of the coldest and snowiest for the UK in years, said: 'I ruined my knee running during the snow on my first week.

'I had to run to get my rounds done in time, because they didn't pay overtime.

'On the other hand, if it's sunny, people expect you to be happy, but there are dogs everywhere and you're just too hot.

'Overcast was the best.

'Essentially, the weather was constantly the bane of my existence.'

Harsh weather and heavy rainfall over the recent months have caused damage to many roads, and rural roads with no tarmac or surfacing often suffer the most
