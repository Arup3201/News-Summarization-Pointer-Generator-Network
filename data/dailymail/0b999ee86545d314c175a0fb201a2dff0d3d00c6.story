The head of the NHS has spent thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money on weekly trips to Birmingham – where, coincidentally, his new wife lives.

Sir David Nicholson has racked up nearly £6,000 in first-class train tickets in a year, on top of his £270,000 pay package.

On each occasion he claims to have been ‘attending an official meeting’ but they were apparently held via video conferencing, meaning he could have taken part from anywhere in the country.

But many of the trips span long weekends, prompting speculation he is going home to his young wife.

Next week, Sir David is likely to face calls to resign when he is implicated in one of the NHS’s worst ever hospital scandals at Mid Staffordshire Trust.

A long-awaited report is expected to criticise him for failing to take action while patients were dying of neglect.

Examination of his expenses claims reveal that in the year 2011/12 Sir David, 57, spent £5,730.50 on 41 train tickets to Birmingham, nearly all of which were first class.

This is near where he lives with his 35-year-old wife, Sarah-Jane Marsh, the £155,000-a-year chief executive of Birmingham Children’s Hospital.

The couple, who have a two-month-old daughter, married last year after Sir David divorced his first wife. 

He divides his working schedule between London and Leeds, where the NHS Commissioning Board is based. But the Department of Health insisted that he also needed to be in Birmingham as it is a ‘central location’.

A spokesman also said that some of the official meetings he attended in the city were held via video conferencing.  This would enable Sir David to speak to colleagues in London, Leeds or elsewhere using his laptop. He used an office in Birmingham for this.

But they were unable to explain why 
he needed to travel to Birmingham to chair a video-conference rather 
than holding it from his offices in London or Leeds.

Matthew
Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The 
startling regularity of Sir David’s trips to Birmingham at the end of a 
week beg the question whether these are actually necessary business 
trips or just an excuse to bill taxpayers for visits to his wife.

‘The NHS must be totally transparent over this incredibly large expenses bill.’

Julie Bailey of Cure the NHS, whose mother died in the care of Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, said: ‘It is outrageous that he is able to claim this amount when he has got to his position through failure.’

Sir David claimed just under £50,000 in expenses last year. This was on top of his £211,000 a year salary, £47,000 ‘benefits in kind’ and £20,000 bonus - although he says he gives this to charity.

Implicated: Sir David is likely to face calls to resign when he is implicated in one of the NHS's worst ever hospital scandals at Mid Staffordshire Trust

Until recently he had been living in the village of Darley, just outside Harrogate, near Leeds. But he now lives in a three-bedroom cottage with his wife in Broome, an attractive village a short drive from Birmingham.

Next week Sir David will come under pressure over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal, where up to 1,200 patients died between 2005 and 2008. He was previously chief executive of the regional health board  which covered Stafford – the West Midlands Strategic Health Authority – yet failed to spot the warning signs. 

He may also be criticised for failing to listen to the concerns of families when he was appointed chief executive of the NHS in 2006.

Earlier this week, Sir David issued an apology for the failings. But the report into the scandal – to be published on Wednesday – is likely to warn that appalling neglect still persists in some areas of NHS.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The nature and responsibilities of the role of NHS Chief Executive require travel across the country, in keeping with a significant national public role at the head of the largest organisation in Europe. All travel is booked in advance wherever possible and journeys are mainly by rail.’ 

The spokesman said Sir David worked from an office in Birmingham owned by West Midlands Strategic Health Authority, where he was formerly chief executive.
