A Russian farmer has demonstrated the power he holds over his animals in this video which appears to show him shepherding his flock of ducks using voice commands alone.

In the clip the bare-chested man can be seen walking out of a barn before he begins shouting at the white ducks milling in the yard outside.

At the sound of his voice the previously scattered ducks immediately fall into formation and as the farmer continues to shout quickly follow him back into the farm building. 

On command: A Russian farmer has demonstrated the power he holds over his animals in this video which appears to show him shepherding his flock of ducks using voice commands alone

Another man can be heard giggling off 
camera as the ducks obey the farmer's barked commands and make their way
 towards the barn, slowly at first before speeding up when the farmer 
shouts again.

The clip was uploaded to YouTube earlier this week and has already been viewed more than one million times by internet users across the globe. 

It is unclear when or where the footage was captured on camera.

Formation: At the sound of his voice the previously scattered ducks immediately fall into formation and as the farmer continues to shout quickly follow him back into the farm building

Spectacle: Another man can be heard giggling off camera as the ducks obey the farmer's barked commands and make their way towards the barn

Many commentators described the clip as 'hilarious', while others joked about the farmer's 'duck army', or suggested they would like the man to train their dogs.

Youtube user SeventEve joked: 'This guy really has all his ducks in a row.'

Another user, HighWarlordJC suggested how the ducks may have been trained to obey the farmer.

They wrote: 'Make the same noise when you do something with animals (feed them, let them in the house, etc) And they will learn what that noise means (Associate it with the action).

'This is true for most animals, including humans.﻿'
