The passenger who caused a major hijack scare and was dragged from a plane by armed police has walked free from a Bali police station today without charge.

Police say they have accepted that 28-year-old Australian plumber Matt Lockely made a genuine mistake when he banged on the cockpit door of the Virgin plane, believing it was where the toilet was located.

After carrying out blood and urine tests, they have also concluded that he was not drunk and have accepted his explanation that he had only consumed soft drink because he was on medication.

Arrested in his flip-flops:  Matt Christopher Lockley is dragged off a Virgin plane by Indonesian Air Force

He has told police that he was flying from Brisbane to Bali in an attempt to save his fractured marriage to an Indonesian woman.

'He has not been charged,' said a police spokesman. 'He is free to leave.'

Lockley
 told questioners he had taken four Panadol tablets, two 
Voltaren (used as a painkiller or to treat inflammation) and drunk only 
two cans of Coca Cola at Brisbane airport before boarding flight VA41 to
 Bali.

He also insisted he 
had been asleep for most of the flight, but when he was woken by the 
crew for a meal, he believed he had lost his bag.

Detained: Lockley was handcuffed by the crew mid-air and placed in a seat at the back of the plane before being arrested when the jet touched down at the Indonesian island's Denpasar airport

He had started talking to a woman in the neighbouring seat before deciding he needed to go to the toilet.

'He
 thought the cockpit was the toilet and was making quite a bit of a 
racket trying to get in,' said police spokesman Hery Wiyanto.

It
 was that incident that had resulted in the pilots, named by Bali police
 as Captain Neil Cooper and co-pilot Ryan Stockwell, reportedly raising 
the alarm about a hijack attempt - although there have been suggestions 
that the wrong alarm button was pressed.

This
 swung into action a major police and military operation, with armed 
officers waiting for the plane to land - while Lockley was grabbed by 
crew members, handcuffed and made to sit on a seat at the rear of the 
aircraft.

Planes were prevented from leaving Denpasar airport, while others were put in a holding pattern or diverted to other cities.

When the plane landed, the armed officers boarded and dragged Lockley out.

Other armed men kept rifles trained on him as he was led down the aircraft steps and into the terminal.

There
 were suggestions that if Lockley had been found to have been drinking 
and had genuinely tried to break into the cockpit he would have been 
charged with causing an affray on an aircraft and could have faced 
several years in jail before being deported.

Mr
 Wiyanto said the plumber, from Brisbane in Queensland, had slept for 
most of the flight and was moved to the back of the plane after talking 
to a passenger.

Mr Lockley has repeatedly told investigators he was not drunk, but suffering from depression due to family problems.

Mr
 Lockley's claims emerged just hours after Australian comedian Dan Ilic 
tweeted: 'Drunk Bogan Hijacker thought "cockpit" was just a fancy 
aeroplane name for "toilet" #boganhijack'.

Looking
 bewildered and wearing flip-flops, Matt Christopher Lockley was dragged
 off the Boeing 737-800 after the jet was forced to make an emergency 
landing in Bali.

The 
Australian was accused of hammering on the cockpit door, forcing the 
pilot to send a mayday message that he feared the plane was being 
hijacked.

Lockley was 
handcuffed by the crew mid-air and placed in a seat at the back of the 
plane before being arrested when the jet touched down at the Indonesian 
island's Denpasar airport.

Police said they were told by a flight 
attendant that Lockley looked 'paranoid' and was demanding medicine.

Lockley gave blood and urine 
samples to police to be tested for alcohol and 
drugs.

'The police are having difficulty 
digging up information on what he intended to do because he is still in 
an unstable condition,' a police official at Bali airport told media straight after his arrest.

Officials said his identification included a driving licence issued by the 
Queensland government, a licence to perform high-risk work and a 
Plumbing Industry Council card.

Police say they have accepted that 28-year-old Australian plumber Matt Lockely made a genuine mistake

The airport was closed for nearly two hours because of the incident, forcing several flights to be diverted, air force base commander Col Sugiharto Prapto said.

Mr Prapto said the plane was directed to park at the end of the runway in case explosives or weapons were involved. Scores of troops surrounded the jet.

Transport
 ministry official Herry Bakti said the alert was triggered when the 
pilot sent a signal to Bali airport that the plane had been hijacked en 
route from Brisbane to Bali at at 2pm local time (7am BST).

He then followed up with a verbal confirmation.

'We then guided the flight to land as they were flying close to the airport,' he said.

However, a Virgin Australia spokeswoman said the pilot had entered the code for 'unlawful interference' which was 'standard operating procedure, based on the threat they perceived at the time'.

The incident occurred on a public holiday in Australia when the country remembers its war dead in the ANZAC day commemorations.

Earlier, Palani
 Mohan, a passenger on a Garuda flight that was about to take off from 
Bali, described events when the plane made the emergency landing.

He said: 'The captain of my plane made an announcement saying we were
 delayed indefinitely because a hijack was going on in Bali airport, 
about 150 metres away from us.

'I saw at least five vehicles including military-style trucks, filled with men in uniform, rushing towards the plane.

'Then
 the Virgin plane taxied away, followed by the convoy of security 
forces. The flight attendant said it's been taken off to a different 
part of the airport.

'Bali 
airport seems to be in lockdown, we've been told no planes will be 
departing or arriving. The pilot's not allowing anyone off our plane.'

But Heru Sudjatmiko, a Virgin 
Australia official on the Indonesian resort island, later said: 'This is no 
hijacking, this is a miscommunication.

from Brisbane to Bali has been hijacked.
