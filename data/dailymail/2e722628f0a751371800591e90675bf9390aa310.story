 Passengers on the budget airline Jetstar are trying to save more money by eluding extra baggage fees.

This excess carry-on is causing many passengers to lose their allocated cabin space, as well as prolonging the boarding process.

In order to address the mounting concern, Jetstar will implement ‘cabin baggage officers’ in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast on a trial basis.

Nip in the bud: Jetstar will soon introduce 'cabin baggage officers' at airport gates in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast

Any passengers who attempt to sneak extra luggage on board will be placed in 'hold in line', where baggage officers will weigh their luggage

The officers will be located at airport gates, where they will weigh and measure customer’s bags as well as arranging to have luggage checked if it looks oversized or over the assigned weight.

At present, passengers who have checked in online can avoid having their bags checked by Jetstar staff until reaching the gate lounge, which is allowing those with excess carry-on to board the flight without the extra-baggage charges, reports Business Traveller.

Now, passengers who attempt this will have their bags placed in the aircraft hold in line, along with the checked baggage allowance that they have purchased. Those who purchased ‘carry only fares’ will be penalised by paying the prevailing airport rates, which are higher than what is charged online.

Caught red handed: Passengers found sneaking on excess luggage will pay a higher rate than what they would have if they had declared the baggage

The excess baggage being snuck on-board is causing passengers to lose their cabin-space and prolonging boarding process

Jetstar currently offers Economy passengers one main and one small item with a total combined weight of up to 10kg. Business Class passengers are allowed two main items with a combined weight of 20kg.

Fees for check-in baggage at the time of booking are $15.50 for baggage of up to 15kg, and $16.50 for baggage of up to 20kg. For baggage checked-in at the airport, fees are $70 for up to 15kg of checked baggage, and $15 for every additional kilo after that.

It is not yet announced when the baggage officers will be introduced.
