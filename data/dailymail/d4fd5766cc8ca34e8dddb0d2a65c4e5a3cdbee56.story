Families were evacuated from a hotel at Disneyland Paris yesterday, amid fears that a shooter was on the loose in the theme park.

There were separate reports of gunfire outside a synagogue in the city's 19th district yesterday morning, and another potential hostage situation at a pharmacy in Jaures.

Tensions were already high in the city following the deaths of 17 innocent people in a wave of terrorist attacks last week.

A Euro Disney spokesman told MailOnline: ‘At 11.30am Paris time on Saturday, January 10, the Sequoia Lodge Hotel at Disneyland Paris was briefly evacuated following a security incident, which turned out to be a false alarm.

‘As a precaution a number of guests were taken into the hotel car park as is usual resort procedure.

‘The whole process, which mainly concerned the lobby area, lasted less than an hour, with the safety cordon lifted quickly and the rest of the resort was not affected in any way.' 

France's President has warned its citizens to remain vigilant in the wake of a brutal attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, the fatal shooting of a policewoman and a deadly showdown between a hostage-taker and police at a Jewish supermarket.

The French Defence Ministry has placed 500 extra soldiers on patrol around Paris to calm nerves in the wake of the attacks. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said France will keep its highest possible security level in the greater Paris area.

Initial reports of a gunman in the theme park yesterday morning conflicted with separate accounts that police were investigating a bomb threat.

And according to Le Parisien, a woman was arrested after shouting from her window that she was Hayat Boumeddiene, who's wanted in connection to the hostage drama which left five people - including the killer - dead in Vincennes yesterday.

False alarms: The police presence at what was eventually deemed a false alarm in Jaures (pictured) coincided with a separate investigation of gunfire outside a synagogue

Fear: Incident at Jaures pharmacy (pictured) was a false alarm - as were the threats at Disneyland and synagogue

The evacuation was eventually dismissed as a false alarm, as were reports of a potential shooting at a synagogue. 

At around 1pm, armed officers were called to rue Armand Carrel, Paris, following reports that a number of shots had been fired outside the Jewish place of worship.

Dozens of officers sped to the scene and the road was closed sparking concerns another terror attack was underway, following two days of violence in the city.

Pictures show police on the scene, with one officer pictured with his gun drawn. 

But police sources later told Le Figaro newspaper that the shots heard in the 19th arrondisment were in fact from firecrackers - adding a 'nervous' resident had called police.

There was a large police and military presence across the city on Saturday, with armed officers and soldiers patrolling public buildings and stations.

Rumours on social media that hostages were being held inside a pharmacy in Jaures, have also been been rubbished.

Grief: Hundreds of grieving Parisiens laid flours outside the Jewish grocery store where four hostages were killed yesterday

Meanwhile, hundreds of Parisiens were laying flowers at the Jewish deli where four people were killed by convicted Islamist, Amedy Coulibaly, yesterday.

Dozens of armed policeman stood guard at an extended security area outside the Hyper Cacher store, as grief-stricken locals paid their tributes to the dead. 

It was one of two separate sieges brought to an abrupt and bloody end yesterday, following three days of constant terror in the French capital.

Police commandos stormed the Jewish grocery store in a storm of bullets and stun grenades, killing an Al Qaeda-linked gunman who was holding 15 hostages.

Twelve minutes earlier, and only 25 miles away, another stand-off ended with the deaths of Charlie Hebdo killers, Said and Cherif Kouachi.

Firing their Kalashnikovs, they charged straight into the guns of hundreds of soldiers and police surrounding their final hideout.
