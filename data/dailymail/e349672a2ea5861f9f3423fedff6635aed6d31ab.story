A San Francisco transit police officer has died after a co-worker accidentally shot him during a raid on an apartment.

Tom Smith, who had served with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) for 20 years, was shot in Dublin, just outside of the city, at about 1.45pm on Tuesday.

The 42-year-old was part of a team of officers who were called to search an apartment belonging to a suspect in a recent spate of robberies on the transit system.

Tragic: BART officer Tom Smith died after a colleague's gun went off as they searched an apartment

As Smith and another officer, who has not been named, entered the empty apartment, a shot was fired. It hit Smith.

The officer, who was married to a BART worker and had a young daughter, died later in hospital.

Sergeant J D Nelson, of the county sheriff's office, told CBS SF Bay Area he assumed the officers had their guns drawn as they entered the building. It is not clear why one of the guns went off.

BART officers carry out searches if they are related to crimes committed on the BART system, Sergeant Nelson added.

Several officers were involved in the raid, and were wearing bulletproof vests as they entered the apartment belonging to suspect, John Henry Lee, who has been in custody since Thursday.

Officers are believed to have knocked 
twice on the apartment door and, after hearing no response and finding 
the door unlocked, they stepped inside, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

Because they didn't know if the apartment was empty, the officers followed protocol and had their guns drawn.

Sergeant Nelson told SF Gate the officer believed to have shot Smith had been with BART for ten years, and added: 'It was either accidental or target misidentification.'

A statement released on Tuesday afternoon read: 'BART has been informed that one of our officers has died from wounds 
sustained during a shooting earlier today. The entire BART organization 
is deeply saddened by this tragic event.'

BART director Gail Murray said: 'Like all peace officers, our BART police risk their lives when they go out to work in the stations and cities.'

Officers from across the district arrived at Eden Medical Center, where Smith was taken after the shooting.

Honor: A police escort was arranged as Smith, the first BART officer to die in the line of duty, was taken to the coroner's office

They stood to attention as Smith's flag-draped coffin was loaded into a coroner's vehicle and driven, with police escort, to Oakland Coroner's Office.

Smith is the first BART officer to be killed in the line of duty in the transit police's 42-year history.

'He was an amazing dad, an amazing neighbor, an amazing man ...This is heartbreaking,' Neha Shah, one of Smith's neighbor's, said.
