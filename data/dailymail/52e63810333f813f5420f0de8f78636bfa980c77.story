A rugby fan in South Africa learned the hard way not to mess with players when he was kicked in the stomach by a member of team USA after tackling him during a game Saturday.

The bizarre incident took place at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth during an HSBC Sevens World Series match between South Africa and the US.

Cameras at the venue were rolling when a member of the audience ran onto the pitch in the middle of the game and tackled American player Perry Baker to the ground.

The 6-foot-one, 180-pound native of Daytona Beach, Florida, got his start at the Arena Football League's Pittsburgh Power before switching sports and joining the Eagles Sevens rugby club to pursue his Olympic dream.

The Twitter-sphere was divided on Baker's conduct, with some saying that it was unsportmanlike to kick a man while he was down, while others saying that the hapless streaker brought it upon himself.

'No need to apologise,was a split second decision. He got off lightly,should have kicked him twice,' wrote supporter Tim Walsh.

But user Danny Beasley was critical of Baker's actions, tweeting: ‘you should be kicked out. Feral dogs don't deserve that treatment. Typical arrogant p****! #onyabike.'
