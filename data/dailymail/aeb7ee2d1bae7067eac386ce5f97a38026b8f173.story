A convicted criminal who says accused murderer Robert Xie made a jail cell confession to killing five members of his family was a prison heavy who gave police evidence 'they wanted' , a lawyer has told a murder trial.

Graham Turnbull SC has told the jury on the third day of the NSW Supreme Court murder trial of Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie that the Crown case against the accused case was driven in large part by a 'ruthless criminal' who 'filled in the gaps' for police.

Mr Xie, 50, is on trial for the murder of five members of the Lin family, who were bludgeoned to death with a hammer in 2009.

The 50-year-old is the uncle and brother-in-law of the victims Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, and Mrs Lin's 39-year-old sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin.

Prison cell confession: Testimony against Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie, pictured outside court where is is standing trial in Sydney, says he confessed his guilt in killing five family members to a jail cellmate. His lawyer has told the murder trial  the cellmate was a prison heavy who knew he could exploit the accused

Bludgeoned to death with a hammer: Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, were killed in their Epping home.

Death house: the Lin family home in the Sydney suburb of North Epping where Robert Xie allegedly beat five of his relatives to death

All five were beaten and asphyxiated in the bedrooms of the Lin's family home in the Sydney suburb of North Epping.

Today in the conclusion of his opening address, Mr Turnbull SC described a convicted criminal known as 'Witness A' who has given a written testimony against Mr Xie as a 'practised informer'.

He described the inmate, who became one of Mr Xie's cellmates after the accused was remanded in custody, as a 'physically intimidating man' who became aware that Xie was 'available for ruthless exploitation.'

Mr Turnbull said the prisoner 'obtained evidence which bolstered the police case, what they needed, what they wanted'.

In his opening case, Crown Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC had told the court Mr Xie had planned to have a dead man's DNA stolen from a funeral home and planted on the murder weapon in what he referred to as his 'Plan B'.He said Mr Xie had various conversations with Witness A about the killings and allegedly revealed he had bought the hammer used in the attack from a 'two-dollar shop' because he knew the store's security cameras were fake.The Crown told the court that Witness A had spoken of the plot, saying Xie had hoped to use a corrupt police officer - a friend of Witness A - to carry out the plan, but who was actually an undercover detective.This afternoon a woman who lived near the house where the murders took place has taken the stand.

Janelle Ferguson said she lived next door to the Lin family in North Epping when the alleged murders occurred.She said on the night the the Lin family members died, her family went out to buy a pizza but came home around 8pm. Ms Ferguson said she was a light sleeper but no sound from the Lin house woke her during the night.

The court has heard that the victims were killed as the murderer moved through the four bedrooms of their home over several hours in the middle of the night.

The prosecution case is that Mr Xie was motivated by a bitterness towards the adults in his family.
