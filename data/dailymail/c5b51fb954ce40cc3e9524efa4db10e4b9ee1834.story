If you’ve always yearned for an idyllic life by the sea, then you might want to start counting your pennies.

An ice-cream seller is offering just that – complete with fisherman’s cottage, 1950s beach hut and ice-cream shop Sundae, Sundae in trendy Whitstable, Kent. 

Steve Graham, 57, has put all three on the market for £675,000, after he decided it would be a shame to break up the seaside dream.

Steve Graham, 57, is selling his seaside home, his ice cream shop, and his original 1950s beach hut all as one package - for the bargain price of just £675,000

The lucky buyers will also bag 
themselves an original wooden beach hut facing directly onto the waves 
at nearby Tankerton Slopes, a dinghy with an outboard motor, and views 
of 'the best sunsets you can see'.

The
package gives families the chance to swap the hustle and bustle of city
living for a quieter, more laid-back life with just a four-minute 
commute.

Mr Graham moved to
Whitstable 12 years ago and set up a successful florist's, before 
deciding to open Sundae Sundae five years ago.

And this is what he's offering...

The package - specially designed for those who do like to be beside the seaside - includes his thriving ice cream parlour, Sundae Sundae, in trendy Whitstable, Kent

Mr Graham's three-bedroom, two-bathroom fisherman's cottage, which he estimates would fetch £350,000 if sold alone

The popular ice-cream and sweet shop, which also sells vintage buckets and spades, crab nets and beach furniture, has been a huge hit with local families and the throngs of visitors to the popular seaside town, but he is now ready to move on.

The widower says he is ready to do 
some travelling and think about his next challenge after losing his wife
in 2010, and fighting his own battle with illness.

But
having collected all the components of such a good life by the sea, he 
thought it was a shame to then break up the picturesque portfolio.

The three properties were put on the market last Friday on the suitably titled website whitstabledream.com.

Steve has already had dozens of enquiries and has been able to draw up a list of ten 'serious potential buyers'.

England's south coast tends to hog the praise when it comes to beaches and sea views, but the north coast of Kent has much to offer - especially in the county's eastern corner.

Whitstable is the pearl in the crown of England's oyster industry - the place where tens of thousands of cultivated oysters are bred, grown and harvested for sale at London's Billingsgate market and beyond.

Shingle-coated beaches and small weathered cottages provide a quiet atmosphere far removed from the candyfloss and pier shows of Southend.

Whitstable is all about seafood and you'll find oyster-selling restaurants by the dozen.

Among them are the internationally acclaimed Crab And Winkle restaurant and Wheelers Oyster Bar - which is widely regarded as one of the UK's best fish restaurants.

There are also numerous galleries, gift shops, boutiques and pubs.

And you may even bump into one of its famous residents, such as comedian Harry Hill (above) or actress Faye Ripley.

Whoever bags the idyllic lifestyle will find themselves at the centre of one of Britain’s trendiest seaside towns and count themselves neighbours with celebrities such as TV comedian Harry Hill and Cold Feet star Faye Ripley.

The package is being marketed as ideal for anyone looking to move out of the city and start their dream life by the sea, with a ready-made income perfect for young families or retirees.

The father-of-one said: 'Having a cottage by the sea and a little ice cream shop is somebody’s dream.

'When I first started talking about selling my house, my friends couldn’t believe it because I have what so many people want so I decided to sell my house, my business and my beach hut all together.

'You can step out of your little 
cottage and walk just four minutes down pretty Harbour Street with its 
independent shops to your own ice cream business.

'You get to spend the day working in this lovely fishing town just round the corner from the harbour.

'When you finish, you can go and sit 
in your own original 1950s' wooden beach hut and enjoy some fish and 
chips with a view of the sea. Perfect.

'I’ve
never heard of anyone doing this. It’s a fantastic opportunity for 
someone, but I’m just ready to move on. I need a change.

'I’ve set up and sold on businesses throughout my life and this one is a success so I’m ready to leave.'

He added: 'I’m a widower and I’m ready to do some travelling and have a think about what to do next.

'There
are good train links to London if you want to commute, but I want 
someone to come and embrace the town and live and work here.

'It would be nice if someone made 
their life here rather than coming to buy the house and renting out the 
cottage and shop. It is a fantastic opportunity.'

If
Mr Graham sold the three components of his life separately, he 
estimates the house would fetch £350,000, his business would cost 
£300,000 and his beach hut would be £25,000.

His cottage is set over three floors and has three bedrooms and two bathrooms and an NHBC (home construction) warranty.

It
is four minutes’ walk from his business in Harbour Street, which is a 
freehold, well established ice cream/seaside store and has planning 
permission pending for a holiday flat with its own separate entrance.

Training and advice on running the shop will be given by a retail expert.

Mr Graham, who fronts popular local 
comedy show band The Trouser Trumpets, said even when he sells up he 
plans to keep strong links with Whitstable.

He
said: 'People fall in love with it. Some people don’t understand it and
they go, "is this it?", but they’re looking for something that’s not 
there.

'It’s got great sunsets. Even the locals still go out and watch the sun. They’re some of the best sunsets you can see.'

Mr Graham’s wife Jan, 54, died after being hit by a train on the Glebe Way crossing in Whitstable on December 27, 2010.
