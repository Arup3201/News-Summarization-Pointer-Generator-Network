These dramatic photos show the changing face of a popular beach that has had an astonishing 6,000 truckloads of sands washed away in just three years.

Worried owners of a holiday park overlooking Hopton-on-Sea beach in Norfolk said the damage threatens the future of the seafront, popular with celebrities including TV presenter Stephen Fry.

They fear that without more protection the cliffs that their £60million caravan site stands on will crumble into the North Sea - and want an urgent £10million repair job to bring back the beach.

Bourne Leisure commissioned a two-year study which claims the erosion has been caused by the construction of nearby Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour in 2008 - something the port company denies.

The report said building the harbour 600m into the sea has altered the tidal drift and taken the sands away from Hopton - and Bourne Leisure now wants a group of authorities to fund the restoration job.

They include the port's management company EastPort UK, owned by investment giant Global Infrastructure Partners, whose advisory board chairman is former prime minister Sir John Major.

Bourne Leisure said the marina was built under an Act of Parliament with provision for protecting the surrounding coast from erosion, meaning the current owners could be liable for rebuild costs.

A Bourne Leisure spokesman said: ‘We are determined to work with the people of Hopton and the relevant bodies to ensure the replacement of the beach.

No protection: Sea defences can't stop the tide which has been rapidly eroding the beach and damaging the cliff face

Broken: The incessant pounding of the incoming tide has caused a concrete path leading down to the beach to collapse

‘It is imperative that the port authority meet their commitments which they agreed to under an Act of Parliament, the Outer Harbour Revision Order 2005.

'We hope this can be resolved amicably but the beach must be returned.’

The port was completed in 2008 but two years later the holiday park said there was ‘significant proof’ that the beach was being washed away.

Coastal erosion expert Dr Philip Barber studied the damage and his report concluded that the port was to blame because of the changes it caused to the tidal flow and littoral drift.

Since 2010 Hopton Beach has lost between 20,000 to 40,000 cubic metres of sand each year - equivalent to 6,000 truckloads.

Bourne Leisure want the port owners to pay for specialist granite groynes to be built onto the sand and also want to hire a dredger from Holland which will spray sand from the seabed onto the beach.

Dr Barber said: ‘The work has shown 
that new Outer Harbour significantly changes the tidal flows in the 
area. This and the impact of the waves has led to the beach 
disappearing.’

But Eliza 
O'Toole, vice chairman of Great Yarmouth Port Company - trading as 
EastPort UK - said: ‘There is no evidence that the Outer Harbour is 
responsible for or contributing to the erosion of Hopton Beach.

‘We are advised by (water consultants) HR Wallingford that variability in beach level and the position of the offshore banks on this coastline is something that has been happening for many tens if not hundreds of years prior to the advent of the outer harbour.

‘There have been modern sea defences at Hopton since at least the late 1960s reflecting this. The outer harbour was not completed until 2010 and cannot be said to be responsible for long standing coastal processes affecting the beach.

‘The provision of coast defences are also the responsibility of various statutory authorities, not the Port.’

Giant leap: People can no longer access the beach from steps due to erosion

No go: Another concrete path has collapsed and wooden steps put in to make access to the beach easier are useless as a result
