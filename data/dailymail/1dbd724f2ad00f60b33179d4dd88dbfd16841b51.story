An overweight mother-of-two whose crippling post-natal depression left her comfort eating and afraid to leave her own home has turned her life around through hypnosis.

Nicola Lamb, from Preston, Lancs, was severely depressed after the birth of her second child Joshua, in December 2012, and ballooned to more than 14st.

Too embarrassed to venture out, the 34-year-old comforted herself by gorging on takeaways and sugary snacks - and lived in leggings and jogging bottoms.

Nicola tried the weight loss app on a whim, having attempted many diets before, and was amazed when her appetite began to reduce 

But after discovering Easy Loss - a hypnosis app - Nicola lost 4st in just six months and dropped from a size 18 to a svelte size 8-10.

Nicola listened to the app every night, and continues to use it now.

The app - 'Easyloss Virtual Gastric Band Hypnosis– Lose Weight Fast' - was created by clinical hypnotherapists James Holmes and Sue Peckham and is a hypnosis recording that she would listen to every night and fall asleep to.

She said: 'The first night I listened to the hypnosis I found it really relaxing and soothing. And I noticed a difference straight away when I woke up the next day.

'I would listen to it every night and fall asleep to the hypnosis – the things it said just seemed to make sense.

'For example we are all told as we grow up to finish our plates and not leave any food. But why are we told that? If we are full, we don't need to keep eating.

'Easy Loss has taught me to stop eating when I am full, and I have changed the sizes of my plates and the portion sizes I give myself. It has totally changed my attitude and my mind set.

'The weight came off quite quickly for me, and it only took six months to reach my goal weight.

'And within about one month of starting the programme I noticed a change in my mental state too.'

She is now the thinnest she has ever been - and has recovered from the crippling post natal depression that left her reluctant to leave home after giving birth to one-year-old Joshua.

Nicola, who also has two-year-old Mia with husband Chris, said: 'I have tried every stupid diet available - I would lose weight initially but I would just pile it back on again.

The mother-of-two suffered postnatal depression after the birth of her second child, son Joshua 

'I just stumbled across Easy Loss as I was looking for something to help me lose the weight for good on my iPad and I typed in 'gastric band'.

'I noticed it straight away and thought I would give it a try as it was just £4.99, and I would spend that easily on a takeaway or a week at Weight Watchers anyway.

'But I noticed a difference straight away, my portion sizes are smaller and now I only eat what I need to eat. It just worked - I can't explain it.

'After I had Joshua I was severely depressed and just ate complete rubbish.. I was a shell of my former self.

Nicola, left with daughter Mia before she lost weight, used to live in baggy clothes, embarrassed about her size but now regularly goes out and socializes, loving her new found confidence 

'The post natal depression came on with being told I would never have children, to all of a sudden having two tiny babies to look after.

'I was too embarrassed to leave the house - it was sink or swim for me and I just sank. The more weight I put on the more depressed I got.

'And if I did go out the anxiety would just be too much, it would spiral out of control.'

Former accountant Nicola has always battled with her weight - but now, at just 10st , the numbers on the scales are at the lowest they have been since her childhood.

And, thanks to her new confidence, she also does a Zumba class twice a week to help keep her weight down and improve her fitness.

Snacks: Three or four chocolate bars 

Lunch: A large sandwich and crisps

Nicola said: 'The kids were the reason I wanted to lose the weight - I would look at them and think I want to be able to go places and do things with them.

'I didn't want to be the fat mum picking them up from school that they were embarrassed about.

'Now I am the thinnest I have ever been and I feel amazing. Everyone comments on the difference too. I feel like I am back to my old self.

'I am much more active and I take the kids out almost every day. I have friends that I go out and socialise with now too which I never would have done in the past.

'My husband thinks it's great.'
