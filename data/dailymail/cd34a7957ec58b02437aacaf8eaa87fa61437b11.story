The boats cruised in formation past many of London's most famous landmarks with new Lord Mayor Alan Yarrow taking up centre position in the fleet.

The new Lord Mayor later disembarked the Gloriana at HMS President at Wapping and headed to Mansion House for the start of the traditional parade.

Among the many people who travelled to the City to welcome him in was his predecessor Fiona Woolf - who resigned this week after days of intense pressure over her links to Leon Brittan.  

Mrs Woolf, a solicitor, stepped down as London's Lord Mayor hours after victims’ groups said she was unsuitable to run the inquiry into historic child abuse - which would be ‘a dead duck in the water’ if she remained. 

Yesterday, she was seen smiling as she handed over the reins to Mr Yarrow - both in ceremonial dress for the occasion.

In his year-long post, the new Lord Mayor says he wants to make sure the financial sector creates wealth for itself, as well as for the country as a whole.

The river pageant got underway at Westminster at 8.30am - later passing under Waterloo and Blackfriars bridges, where a fireworks display was put on in the early evening. 

The Lord Mayor heads the City of London Corporation, which oversees the Square Mile. It is the only local government authority in Britain whose members are elected predominantly by voters appointed by businesses.

The position was introduced by King John in 1215 in a bid to win support from the City by giving it the right to elect its own mayor.

Originally, after being elected, the new Lord Mayor would travel by river to Westminster, to pledge allegiance to the sovereign - but the procession ceased to become waterborne in 1856.

Many livery companies had got rid of their barges and the Thames was not in a good state, so the procession transferred to the land. It was only revived last year.

Outgoing Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf is only the second woman in eight centuries to take the position, while the incoming Lord Mayor is Alan Yarrow, a member of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and a career banker.

He assumed the position yesterday and was sworn in at the Silent Ceremony at the Guildhall - so-called because the only words uttered are the Lord Mayor’s oath.

The event marks the hand over of the title of Lord Mayor, a centuries-old position whose incumbent heads the City of London Corporation, the organisation charged with overseeing the running of the Square Mile. 

More than 20 bands and 150 horses took part in the procession through the city with thousands of people in cars and on foot also trailing behind.

The parade featured representatives from the Armed Forces, the London Stock Exchange Group and several charities.
