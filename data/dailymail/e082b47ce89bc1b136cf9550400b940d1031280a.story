A Scottish couple had a close encounter with a bear as they locked up their Californian vacation home - and they didn't even realize it.

Surveillance footage shows Bob and Irene McKeown leaving the home in Pasadena near Angeles National Forest without even noticing the bear that was right next to them.

The curious cub then followed them to their car before they finally saw it.

'I felt something brushing against my leg. Once I closed the [car] door, I turned around, I shout, 'It's a bear! It's a bear!'" said Bob McKeown to KTLA. He suffered just a small nick on his leg.

Bear encounter: A Scottish couple had a close encounter with a bear without even realizing it. Surveillance footage captured them locking up a house in California without seeing the bear was right next to them

Bearly there: The couple were locking up the front door of the house where they were staying. The bear eyed them up but they barely noticed!

On the hunt: The elderly couple head to the car and the curious creature follows them

Neighbors say the baby brown bear has been wondering around the neighborhood which is located in the foothills near the Angeles National Forest, since Tuesday.

The video shows the bear slowly approaching the entrance, only to stop as the couple walks out of the house.

The bear then follows the pair as they walk to their car. It was then they realized they were not alone.

After helping Irene into the vehicle, Bob felt something on his leg.

'I closed the door and I looked…. a 
bear!' Bob McKeown said. 'You don’t know how scared you are, you just 
see a bear. I’ve never encountered a bear.' he added.

With his wife safely inside the vehicle, Bob McKeown ran for the stairs to let himself back into the house.

Scratched: Just as Bob was getting back into the house, he felt a nick on his leg. He had to go to hospital to have a tetanus shot soon afterwards

But he did not escape unscathed, the bear had clawed at his right calf.

'It comes around trash day. It gets hungry, so it just comes out. But it's very friendly. It's not aggressive at all,' said Pasadena resident Marina Tucker.

Animal control officers and Pasadena police, armed with shotguns, were on the scene monitoring the bear as it meandered.

'He might be just knocking, looking around for some garbage cans, looking for something to eat and then once he couldn't find something, or he found something, he'll work his way back to an area where he feels safe, which is suitable habitat,' said J.C. Healy with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Bearing-all: Thankfully the couple were unharmed by the bears antics and  were able to have a good chuckle about it all afterwards

On the loose: The bear has been roaming the streets in Pasedena, California for a few days now

We've got you: The bear was spotted in residential backyards in Pasadena on Thursday afternoon, prompting a response from police, wildlife officials, local residents and news media

Pasadena police say residents should be aware that the bear could still be out in the neighborhood. They will be back later today to patrol the streets and watch for the animal.

California's black bear population is at about 25,000 to 30,000, with most living in mountain areas above 3,000 feet, according to what the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife calls conservative estimates. In 1982, the statewide bear population was estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000.

Less than 10 percent of the state's black bear population lives in the central western and southwestern California region, according to agency estimates. About half of the population resides in an area north and west of the Sierra Nevada.

The Department of Fish and Wildlife has recorded 12 'bear attacks' since 1980. An attack is defined as 'physical contact, injury or death.'

The last reported attack in Los Angeles County occurred in July 2003 when a hiker was knocked down by a bear at a campsite on Pacific Crest Trail in Angeles National Forest.
