Two days after being sacked as England’s one-day cricket captain, Alastair Cook put his troubles behind him on Monday night with two superb centuries.

Unfortunately for the opener, he was using darts, not a bat. And he was a long way from the pristine surroundings of Lord’s.

Many of the boisterous punters at the PDC World Championship were wearing Christmas jumpers and there were even a couple of reindeer present

The 29-year-old, who remains England’s Test captain, took the stage at Alexandra Palace shortly before 7pm for a challenge match against fast bowler James Anderson.

And Cook looked a natural in the one-leg shootout.

‘I was nervous,’ admitted Cook. ‘I scored a hundred — and it’s the first time I’ve done that on TV for a while. My legs were shaking.’

Asked for his thoughts on being ditched from the England one-day set-up, he added: ‘I am frustrated and disappointed that I am not joining Jimmy on the plane (to the World Cup)

‘I have to take it on the chin.

It’s hard to talk about at the moment because of the way I feel. I will get away from it for a couple of weeks now.’

England cricket chiefs approached the PDC to arrange the match after darts became a hit with the players on tour. 

Cook did the full walk-on, wearing a shirt with ‘Alastair ‘Bed n Breakfast’ Cook’ emblazoned on the back. Anderson’s top read ‘The Swinger’.

In practice, Cook had achieved a 13-dart leg and he brought that form to the oche. He scored 100 and 140 — and despite missing seven darts at double 13, he hit double 11 to clinch the game and see off his team-mate.
