A radio presenter in New Zealand has landed in hot water after referring to women weighing 72kg (158 lbs) as ‘heifers’ and ‘a bunch of lardos’ on-air, when she thought her microphone was switched off.

Rachel Smalley, 42, made the comments after discussing a story on-air that said a popular contraceptive pill was less effective when taken by women who weighed more than 70kg (154lbs).

The breakfast radio programme reported on Wednesday that the average weight of New Zealand women was 72kg – though according to Bloomberg it is 74.6kg – and therefore the pill was ineffective for most of the female population.

Radio host Rachel Smalley committed a huge on-air gaffe when she said that women weighing 72kg (158lbs) were 'heifers' and 'a bunch of lardos'

The show then went to an ad break, but the presenters’ microphones were left on and Smalley could be heard over the top of the advertisement voicing her horror at the plumpness of her fellow countrywomen.

‘The average woman is 72kg?’ Smalley said incredulously.

‘Heifers! Considering the average height’s, what, 5’6? Lardos, bunch of lardos.’

The presenter later apologised for her on-air gaffe.

‘I deeply regret the comments. They were offensive,’ Ms Smalley said.

‘I left my microphone on and a conversation meant for off-air, went on-air and the audience only heard one side of that conversation.

‘That said, my comments were offensive. I'm sorry. It was a genuine mistake.’

Twitter was abuzz after the comments.

 ‘I'm a 'lardo' and Im owning it...’ tweeted ZM colleague Polly Gillespie.

Jay-Jay Feeney, another radio presenter posted: ‘I weigh a bit over 72kgs. I'm what Rachel Smalley would call 'a hefer' [sic] or 'a Lardo'. #TimeToDietAgain’
