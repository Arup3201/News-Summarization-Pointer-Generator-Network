The unemployed will be made to undergo attitude tests, the employment minister has revealed.

Benefits-seekers will be judged on whether they are ‘determined’, ‘bewildered’ or ‘despondent’ about taking a job, under plans prepared by Esther McVey.

Jobseekers who are judged to be less mentally prepared will be given intensive coaching at the job centre.

‘It will be scales of eager, despondent, maybe apprehensive,’ said Miss McVey.

‘There are factors within that: somebody who is apprehensive but willing is different from someone who is reticent but disengaged. 

'For a mum coming back to work after a long time, it could be about self-confidence and self-esteem.

‘It is a tailor-made, far more sophisticated system.’

The pilot scheme has been put together under plans by Employment Minister Esther McVey 

Jobseekers’ levels of self-belief and behavioural norms will be assessed by interviewers.

The claimants will be asked to describe what they think the ‘risks of going to work’ and the ‘value of work’ are.

Miss McVey’s ‘segmentation’ programme has been inspired by the work of the wife of the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, Therese Rein.

Her company has used attitude profiling in back-to-work schemes since the 1990s. 

A UK pilot scheme is taking place in three job centres and, if successful, it will be rolled out for a voluntary trial involving 27,000 jobseekers in 27 cities.

The idea will be to see whether the attitude tests can accurately predict whether someone will take a job.

It is thought the tests could be used to select candidates for the work programme, under which claimants have to work in order to receive benefits.

It will also be used to recruit people to a new scheme obliging the long-term unemployed to spend 35 hours a week at the job centre as they learn to write cover letters and sit interviews.
