The NFL did not receive a video of Ray Rice knocking out his fiancee in a casino elevator before it was published online after they failed to investigate the case properly, according to an independent review.

'The NFL should have done more with the information it had and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information about the February 15 incident,' former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III said in a statement after releasing his 96-page report on Thursday.

The Ravens running back was only suspended for two games after his arrest for punching his now-wife Janay during a night out at an Atlantic City, New Jersey casino in February.

After video of the incident emerged on TMZ, he was released by the team and suspended indefinitely from the league, although the latter decision was ultimately reversed.

In his report, Mueller said he can find no evidence the league received the video of the incident.

 A law enforcement official previously said he had mailed a DVD to NFL headquarters in April. The report said a review of phone records and emails of NFL employees showed no evidence that anyone in the league had seen the video before Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice.

The private investigation without subpoena power did not include any contact with the law enforcement official who claimed the DVD had been sent to the league.

The officer had also played the Associated Press a 12-second voicemail from an NFL office number dated April 9, in which a woman verifies receipt of the DVD and says: 'You're right, it's terrible.'

The official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to share the evidence, said he took steps to avoid being found or identified by the NFL.

'We have reviewed the report and stand by our original reporting,' said Kathleen Carroll, the AP's executive editor.

'The Mueller team did ask us for source material and other newsgathering information, but we declined. Everything that we report and confirm goes into our stories. We do not offer up reporters' notes and sources.'

Mueller's report disputed this, saying that investigators 'found no evidence that anyone at the NFL had or saw the in-elevator video before it was publicly shown'.

'We also found no evidence that a woman at the NFL acknowledged receipt of that video in a voicemail message,' Mueller said.

Investigators spoke with Goodell and more than 50 NFL employees, all 188 women who had been in the NFL office building on the day of the supposed voicemail, and looked at e-mails from all league officials, many of which contradicted the notion they might have viewed the elevator video.

The probe also searched more than 400 NFL employee computers plus mobile phones of top NFL executives.

'We found no evidence the in-elevator video was or had been stored or viewed on a league computer prior to the video's public release,' Mueller said.

But Mueller also found the NFL's deference to the law enforcement process involving Rice 'led to deficiencies in the league's collection and analysis of information during its investigation.'

The approach 'can foster an environment in which it is less important to understand precisely what a player did than to understand how and when the criminal justice system addresses the event.' 

Robert Mueller concluded in his report that the NFL had substantial information about the case

Mueller's report details some of the efforts the NFL made in obtaining the video, but said the league should have taken additional steps to find out what happened inside the elevator.

'League investigators did not contact any of the police officers who investigated the incident, the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office, or the Revel to attempt to obtain or view the in-elevator video or to obtain other information,' the report said.

'No one from the league asked Rice or his lawyer whether they would make available for viewing the in-elevator video they received as part of criminal discovery in early April.'

The report also said the league didn't follow up on initial conversations with the Ravens to determine whether the team had more information.

The official showed the AP multiple videos from the casino the night Rice was arrested. Those videos included security cameras from inside and outside the elevator and two cellphone videos that included some audio.

The league said it considered the video published by TMZ in September to be new evidence meriting an indefinite suspension.

Its emergence drew renewed backlash to the league from women's organizations, members of Congress and players - all calling for more detail on how the NFL handled the case.

Giants owner John Mara and Steelers President Art Rooney, the men appointed by Goodell as liaison's to the investigation, said Mueller made six recommendations that the owners will review.  Rooney and Mara discussed the report's recommendations with Goodell on Thursday.

Rooney and Mara agreed that the league's policy on domestic violence was insufficient.

'We were slow to react, and in the case of Ray Rice, the original punishment was insufficient,' their statement said.

'In addition, the steps taken by the NFL to investigate this matter were inadequate. Since then, a new policy concerning domestic violence and other rules for conduct violations have been put into place.'

In the wake of the knockout punch video becoming public, Rice was released by the Ravens. He won a legal appeal in November to overturn the indefinite suspension but did not play in the 2014 NFL season and remains a free agent.
