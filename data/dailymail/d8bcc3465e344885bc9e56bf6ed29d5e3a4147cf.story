An 82 year-old great-grandmother from 
Cornwall - who may hold claim to the title of Britain’s oldest punk 
rocker - is to be the subject of an upcoming documentary film.

Sprightly
 pensioner Viva Hamnell’s story of her rise to fame as a vocalist with 
legendary Cornish punk band The Bricks in the late 1970’s and her later 
notoriety during a sensational drug trial is charted by award-winning 
director Amanda Bluglass and cameraman Danny Cooke.

After
 the breakdown of her marriage in 1976, the then forty-five year old 
mother-of-two moved to a secluded farmhouse in the tiny village of St 
Anne’s Chapel, Gunnislake, Cornwall to face up to what she perceived as a
 bleak future, alone and isolated.

Mother-of-two Viva says 'punk has a great freedom with no rules'

'After the marriage split my life changed and I sat down on the front step of my new home and literally cried my eyes out,' said Viva.

But as the musical and cultural explosion of punk rock gripped the nation over the long, hot summer of ’76, Viva soon found herself leading an unlikely double life - as a lollipop lady by day and a backing singer with 21 year-old son Simon’s punk rockers The Bricks - by night.

The popular seven piece band – generally acknowledged as Cornwall’s first punk outfit - soon gained a cult following and garnered favourable comparisons with new wavers the Rezillos, as they toured Devon and Cornwall with tracks such as 'High Rise Harry' and 'Dole Queue.'

'There was a spirit and energy about punk – it had great freedom with no rules,' explained Viva, who fell foul of the law in February of 1979 when an early morning drugs swoop by police discovered cannabis plants growing in her garden and the bizarre circumstances of her trial made the national press.

'I was in bed on a Saturday morning when the police burst in and when they asked me what it was I said: ‘I thought they were tomato plants.’

During the subsequent court case Mrs. Hamnell was duly found not guilty after claiming she’d received the plants from a friend and unaware of their true nature, had intended feeding them to her pet goat.

'It was the worst two days of my life. It was horrendous,' she recalls.

'I didn’t think there was anything sinister,' she explained to the judge at Plymouth Crown Court at the time. 'I just planted them.'

While Viva has moved on from the black tights, girl guide outfits and safety pin earrings of her punk heyday, her current look echoes the creations of Dame Vivienne Westwood

While Viva has moved on from the black tights, girl guide outfits and safety pin earrings of her punk heyday, her current look echoes the creations of Dame Vivienne Westwood, the pioneering designer who brought punk and new wave fashions into the mainstream.

Filmmaker Bluglass whose recent project 'Ray: A Life Underwater' received 12 film festival plaudits internationally, explained how she was attracted to Viva Hamnell as her latest project.

'A friend told me about Viva and the minute I met her I just knew this film had to happen. It’s an incredible story that just had to be told.

'We’ve followed Viva from her farmhouse to Glastonbury where she has worked for the last thirty years and reliving her years of leading a punk band to setting up the Elephant Fayre - the forerunner of Cornwall’s renowned Port Eliot Festival.'

With the short-edit version of the film soon to be screened on Channel 4, Amanda hopes an internet crowd-funding scheme will allow the purchase of the only known footage of The Bricks performing live and a much longer version of the documentary to be completed.

'This footage, owned by the BBC, is such a find and will transport the viewer back decades.

Viva Hamnell keeps a high profile despite her advancing years, with an audience-participation performance where she shares her experiences with small, intimate audiences.

'To me it’s just my life history but there’s been so many people along the way, and the punk era in particular brought something alive in me.

'I never think I’m 82 as in my head I’m just Viva, which is Latin for ‘to live’ and that’s what I’ve got to do.'

Director Amanda Bluglass says that she knew the story had to be told as soon as she met pensioner Viva
