Most youngsters hate the sight of the  bath – but here’s at least one cheeky little monkey who can’t get enough of the hot tub.

These Japanese macaques, or snow monkeys, have taken to plunging into hot springs to protect themselves from the fierce, freezing conditions of the snowy highlands where they live.

They learned of the benefits of the springs just 50 years ago, copying humans who bathed in the boiling water that bubbles out of crevices in the frozen ground in an area known as Hell’s Valley.

In order to avoid clashes over the hot water, a special pool for the monkeys was built higher up in the valley, away from people.

Boasting its own waterfalls, soaking pool and resting ledges, the Jigokudani Yaen-koen Monkey Park in central Japan is now home to about 200 macaques.

Living in the icy Japanese highlands, these monkeys have adopted a rather unusual pastime to keep warm - heading to the hot tub

With their double layer of thick fur they are able to withstand temperatures as low as of minus 15 degrees centigrade. But when it is at its coldest the clever primates have a second line of defence - spending much of their days bathing in hot springs

The warm-water dips are a useful second line of defence for the primates, who have a double layer of thick fur that enables them to withstand temperatures as low as -15C.

The intelligent monkeys also make snowballs just for fun, and have been seen indulging in playful fights.
