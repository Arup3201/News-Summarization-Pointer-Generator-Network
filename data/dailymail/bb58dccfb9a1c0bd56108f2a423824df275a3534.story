Dinner time: Forget give the dog a bone, this pooch merely wants a piece of potato

Salivating: However, for Argus the Hungarian Vizla the deep-fried Tater Tot lays just beyond his reach

Caught on camera: A two minute six second video shows the canine from Austin, Texas, desperately trying to paw the solo morsel from a marble counter top with no joy

So close: Each time he makes an attempt he misses the piece of food by several inches

Grrr: After disappearing from view for several moments he reappears with a look of determination in his eyes

I give up! But, as before, the distance proves to too far and he is unable to grab the potato

Each time he makes an attempt, he misses the piece of food by several inches with his nails sliding away.

After disappearing from view for several moments he then reappears with a look of determination in his eyes.

Standing on his hind legs, he finds his balance and starts the same motion with his front paws.

But, as before, the distance proves to too far and he is unable to grab the potato.

At one point he sniffs the air, salivating at the fried smell wafting over.

As it becomes clear his dining mission has failed, Argus gets increasingly disheartened and he throws some 'puppy dog eyes' at the camera.

Finally his owner intervenes, bringing an end to his snacking antics.

'What ya doin'? Get down,' a woman is heard saying.

The pup obediently gets down from the counter top as soon as he hears the voice. 

His owner reassures viewers that he did get given the Tater Tot in the end -once he got off the kitchen counter.
