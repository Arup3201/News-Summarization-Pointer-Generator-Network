The failure of teachers to control badly behaved children in lessons is dragging down standards, the chief inspector of schools will warn this week.

Too many teachers have come to believe that poor discipline is an inevitable part of life in the classroom and heads need to crack down on the problem, Sir Michael Wilshaw will say.

He will deliver his verdict after the publication of a major report by the schools inspectorate Ofsted, showing that a vast amount of teaching time is wasted because staff are struggling to control problem pupils.

Head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw, centre, said teachers need to crack down on poor classroom discipline

Teacher unions hit back last night, accusing Sir Michael of ‘talking nonsense’ by suggesting teachers accepted poor discipline, arguing instead that they were being let down by out-of-touch senior staff.

The Oftsed report, based on specially commissioned surveys of teachers and parents and more than 3,000 school inspections, found that most teachers admit they are plagued by pupils making silly comments to get attention, swinging on chairs, passing notes around, humming or using mobile phones. Many teachers complained that heads were failing to back them and did not assert their authority when dealing with pupils flouting rules.

The findings will bolster Sir Michael’s concerns that ‘a culture of casual acceptance’ of persistent disruption was preventing England’s school system from competing with high-performing Asian countries.

This week he will also say that while serious breaches of discipline are less common today, the chances of pupils being in calm and well-ordered classrooms had become ‘something of a lottery’, damaging their future prospects. Ofsted’s annual report in December found that 700,000 pupils were attending schools where behaviour needed to improve.

Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT said teachers are not failing to address disruptive pupils 

And in a challenge to heads, he will argue that strong leadership is the key to cracking down on disruptive behaviour and creating good conditions for learning.

Chris Keates, general secretary of union NASUWT, said her members acknowledged there was a widespread problem with low- level disruption in lessons.

But she added: ‘The Chief Inspector is, as usual, talking nonsense to suggest that teachers accept this and are failing to address it.

‘What teachers do say is that… they are frequently unsupported by school leaders who too often do not teach and are divorced from the day to day realities of life in the classroom.’

Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘Behaviour in the vast majority of schools is good and continually improving, according to Ofsted itself.

‘We agree that school leaders must support staff.

‘Good behaviour comes from the skills of teachers but also from a consistent policy across the institution.’
