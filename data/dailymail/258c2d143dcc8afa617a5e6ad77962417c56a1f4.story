A chef has created Scotland's priciest pudding made with edible 24-carat gold leaf, Dom Perignon champagne jelly and vanilla beans imported from Madagascar.

Edinburgh-based restaurateur Mark Greenaway's rhubarb and Champagne crumble will set diners back £30 for a portion.

Mr Greenaway, who previously appeared on popular BBC series Great British Menu, said: 'We got the first of the season's rhubarb in last week and I was playing around with it, trying to think of what to do.

'There was some Dom Perignon champagne open and I just decided to mix the two together.

'The fizz of the Champagne and the sourness of the rhubarb means these flavours go together so well.'

Innovative chocolatier IQ Chocolate, based in Stirling, was commissioned to create an exclusive white chocolate for the dish, using coconut blossom nectar as a key ingredient instead of sugar.

The white chocolate sphere contains rhubarb parfait, Dom Perignon jelly and the base is carefully crafted out of pistachio and shortbread, with small rhubarb meringues dotted around the plate.

Each dessert takes Mr Greenaway's team between four to five hours to make from scratch.

The rhubarb and champagne crumble comes with a glass of Dom Perignon champagne and will be available, pre-order only, Restaurant Mark Greenaway from 7 to 13 February. 

While Mr Greenaway's pudding might be Scotland's priciest, it certainly isn't the most expensive dish in the world.

Norma Restaurant in New York served a $1,000 (£662) frittata  made with potatoes, a pound of lobster and ten ounces of caviar. 

The most expensive soup in the world, served at Tiato Restaurant in Santa Monica, contains Wagyu beef, white alba truffles, a foie gras broth, hand-raised bean sprouts and noodles made from rare blue lobster meat and will set diners back $5,000 (£3,312). 

In October last year head chef at London's Honky Tonk restaurant, Chris Large created the world's most expensive burger, a snack costing £1,100 made with caviar, Champagne, gold leaf and lobster. 

Sushi was luxed up when Phillipines restaurant Angelito Araneta served a 24-carat gold leaf version with 0.2-carat African diamonds. The dish, which cost $2,700 (£1,789) also came with three Mikimoto pearls. 

New York's Serendipity 3 restaurant created a $25,000 (£16,573) dessert made from a blend of eight cocoas include 14 of the world's most expensive varieties with 5g of edible 23-carat gold and served in a golden goblet lined with 1-karat white diamonds and a gold spoon which can be taken home.
