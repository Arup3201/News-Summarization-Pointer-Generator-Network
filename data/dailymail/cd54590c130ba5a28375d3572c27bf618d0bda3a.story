They cost the taxpayer £50,000 a year in benefits and have hardly lifted a finger in their lives, but members of this family can still afford to blow their cash on designer trainers and mopeds.

The Kerrigans, from Sheffield, claim tens of thousands of pounds in benefits for their taxpayer-funded lives and insist they are simply getting what they are entitled to.

Most of them have never worked, claiming handouts straight out of school, but still say they should be given more money.

Supersize family: The Kerrigans claim more than £50,000 a year in benefits and most of them have not held down a job since leaving school

The extended family of three generations live between three houses in Sheffield but spend most of their time together, with many claiming they are too sick to work.

Despite claiming £740 a month herself, mother-of-five Rose Kerrigan, 52, believes people do not get enough state handouts.

She has not held down a full-time job in decades and admits that she does 'nowt'. 

In the Channel 5 documentary on her family, titled My Big Benefits Family, she said: 'I think it's pathetic, I'll be honest with you. This is why people go out pinching and shoplifting because they can't live on [benefits]. 

'If they got enough benefits they wouldn't need to go out and do things like that.' 

Robert Kerrigan, Rose's nephew, spends a significant portion of his benefits on buying himself designer trainers and maintaining his three mopeds.

None of Robert and Adam Kerrigan and their friend Carl, who spends most of his time with the Kerrigans, have a job

The 24-year-old has four children but considers himself a father figure to seven.

He said: 'I think it's all right for me really. My benefits pay my maintenance for my kids. I treat my girlfriend with clothes and trainers and that.

'I wouldn't be bothered if I had holes in my shoes so long as my kids look nice and are healthy. At the end of the day it's my money. If I skint myself then that's up to me.'

Despite this claim, Robert still finds hundreds of pounds a year to spend on Adidas and Nike shoes. 

'In the last year I've spent £600 on trainers. The most I've ever spent on a pair is about £130,' he said.

With none of the family working, their days appear to be spent caring for their children, doing weekly volunteer work at a food bank, and drinking.

Carl, an honorary Kerrigan who is friends with the family and spends most of his time with them, is seen downing apple schnapps as he explains how he drifts from day to day. 

'Every day is the same day. When it's the weekend it's the same day. Sometimes I don't even know if it's the weekend,' he says.

Mother-of-three Carol Kerrigan, 24, who has never held a job other than work experience and is on jobseekers' allowance, says she would work if someone gave her a job.

She has recently moved back into her mother's council house.

She said: 'Everybody would struggle without benefits. It's not just the Kerrigans - everyone is on benefits. 

'It's not our problem if there's no jobs. We're not saying we won't work. We will work. Just give us a job and we'll do it.

'Too many people are coming from different areas and taking our jobs, obviously.' 

The first episode of Channel 5's My Big Benefits Family is available on Demand 5.
