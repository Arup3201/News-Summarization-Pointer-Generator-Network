He played one of the most enduring characters in British television history.

So it was perhaps only fitting that Bill Pertwee’s funeral gave one last nod to his on-screen alter ego yesterday.

The actor, who starred as curmudgeonly air raid warden Hodges in long-running BBC sitcom Dad’s Army, was carried in to Downs Crematorium in Brighton with his famous white tin helmet perched on top of his coffin.

His former co-stars Ian Lavender, 67,
who played ‘stupid boy’ Private Pike and 81-year-old Frank Williams, 
who was Rev Farthing, attended the 45-minute service to say goodbye to 
Pertwee, who died peacefully in his sleep on 26th May.

Despite
spending the last years of his life living in a care home in 
Wadebridge, Cornwall, family members yesterday said that the 86-year-old
had requested that he be buried in Brighton, next to his wife of 45 
years, Marion McLeod, who died on the same day in 2005.

Guests,
including actress Su Pollard who starred alongside Pertwee in comedy 
series You Rang M’Lord, cheered as Pertwee’s coffin arrived at the 
crematorium, while a tribute was read by his son Jonathan at the 
service.

The gathered growd sang hymns Morning
Has Broken and Love Divine, All Love Excelling, and as the coffin was 
carried out, Pertwee’s own song Get Out and Get Under the Moon was 
played.

Actress Pamela 
Cundell, the only other surviving member of the popular comedy series, which ran between 1968 and 1977, was unable to attend the 
funeral, but told the Daily Mail that the classic Home Guard comedy has 
inherited a whole new generation of young fans in recent years.

Miss
Cundell, 93, who played amorous widow Mrs Fox said the programme is now
enjoying a remarkable resurrection thanks to Saturday evening repeats 
on BBC2.

She said: ‘I have 
got a whole lot of new fans who are little boys and girls. Especially 
little boys. Aged about six to about ten. They all call me Mrs Fox. They
don’t know my real name. They say: “Mummy said I can have my photo 
taken with you Mrs Fox.”'

‘One day there was a little boy of 
about nine. He said, “Can I sit on your knee Mrs Fox?” I said, “Yes. Why
do you like Dad’s Army so much?” He said, “Because it is funny and not 
rude”. Out of the mouths of babes.’

Miss
Cundell said Dad’s Army continues to entertain TV audiences because its
humour is essentially innocent, although she admitted the script did 
contain a few adult innuendos for older watchers.

She
said: ‘It was a lot of bumbling old men who get it right in the end. 
These kids see their grandfathers I suppose. There were a few naughty 
bits. My favourite line was “Have you got a sausage”. Everybody shrieks 
at that. We had a lot of fun.

‘It was popular because people 
remember the Home Guard and it was a lot of silly old fools trying to do
the right thing. It still works. It is on every Saturday. Dad’s Army 
will never date, because it has already dated.’

Miss Cundell said she wished there were more modern TV comedies that were suitable for children and adults alike.

She said: ‘I don’t know if they would
make something like that nowadays. We need a good sitcom. There are no 
good comedies nowadays. It’s not like it used to be.

‘Comedy today is not the same. There is none of that sort of humour being made. It is all one liners and rather filthy.

‘You
get lots of adult humour, but nothing for both young and old. Young 
people still love Dad’s Army. It is wonderful. There is nothing like 
that, that the whole family can watch together.’

Stars of BBC sitcoms: Gordon Peters made an appearance in Are You Being Served? and Bernard Cribbins, star of Jackanory, paid their respects

She added: ‘Family life has gone out of the window nowadays. You all used to be there together for Sunday lunch and sit round the table, mother and father and the whole family. But now Sundays are just like any other day. The shops are open. Families don’t sit down together anymore.’

Miss Cundell’s character, an amorous widow, becomes increasingly friendly with Lance Corporal Jack Jones, the town’s elderly butcher played by Clive Dunn, who died last year. Their characters married in the final episode.

She said: ‘It is so sad to see how many of us have passed on. I was very sorry when poor old Clive popped his clogs as well.’

Pertwee became involved in show business in 1954 after joining his cousin Jon Pertwee at a seaside variety show.

Heyday: The beloved sitcom ran for 80 episodes in the 1970s and has reached a younger audience by being played on repeat

He appeared in three Carry On films 
and had a distinguished career in theatre and TV as well as appearing in
more than 1,000 radio broadcasts for BBC comedy shows including Beyond 
Our Ken and Round the Horne.

He
was president of the Dad’s Army Appreciation Society and in 2007 he 
received an MBE for his charitable services in supporting children’s 
hospices.

Fellow Dad’s Army star Arthur Lowe died in 1982 aged 66 and John Le Mesurier the following year aged 71.
