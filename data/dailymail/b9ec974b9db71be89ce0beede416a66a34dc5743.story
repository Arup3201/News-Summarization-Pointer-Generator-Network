Health anxiety: Like many women worried about their health, Kate turned to alternative medicine

Several months ago, I started feeling unusually tired. Walking to the shops felt like wading through treacle, and I would wake every morning with splitting headaches and stomach pains.

I got every cough and cold going and the glands in my throat were like golf balls. I couldn't seem to shake off anything and the symptoms went on for more than six weeks.

Like many women worried about their health, I turned to alternative medicine - something I had never done before. A few years ago, I would have dismissed alternative remedies as useless, but I was swayed by friends who swore by their nutritionists (and, I admit, celebrity endorsements).

I typed my symptoms into Google and many websites sprung up suggesting I had leaky gut syndrome and candida.

'Leaky gut', I read, is caused by a build-up of toxins - including environmental pollutants, chemicals and harmful effects from things such as coffee, alcohol and sugar - as a result of my liver not working at its optimum.

Apparently the small intestines become inflamed and irritated, which allows these toxins to enter the bloodstream. The immune system reacts to this, and becomes overloaded, leading to symptoms including infections, tiredness and headaches.

Candida is a yeast that can destroy gut flora (good bacteria) and allow bad bacteria and viruses to exist in the gut. Good bacteria is destroyed by a diet high in sugar, alcohol and antibiotics.

What the websites suggested was a liver cleanse for the leaky gut (detoxing the  liver to enable it to work properly) and  taking a host of supplements and herbal remedies to improve my health and immune system and tackle the candida.

Liver cleanses have become increasingly popular as more celebrities embark on weird and wonderful diets and cleanses to detox their system. I did half question if this could work, but felt so ill I was willing to try anything. And the sites seemed so convincing and dressed it all up in medical language, so I didn't think of going to a doctor.

I'd become slightly disillusioned by the NHS as it always took so long to get an appointment, but this seemed quick and easy.

Getting healthy this way is certainly not cheap. As I loaded my basket with nutritional supplements and liquids, I was shocked how expensive they were, ranging from £8 to £35 for a bottle of pills.

There was L-glutamine, an amino acid designed to repair the intestinal wall; acidophilus pills (probiotics) to keep the gut flora healthy; liver 'support' tablets such as L-orinthine - a non-essential amino acid said to help regenerate the liver and aid the immune system; and milk thistle, a flowering Mediterranean herb used to treat liver problems.

Disgusting: Kate's DIY liver detox mixture tasted so horrible, she nearly threw up

Candida tablets and oregano oil capsules to get rid of fungus in the gut were also among my purchases.

For the liver cleanse the choice ranged from pre-packaged versions with herbal pills, to more extreme ones using Epsom salts. I opted for the extreme version as it was cheaper, which consisted of Epsom salt 'cocktails' and concoctions of olive oil and grapefruit juice.

The Epsom salts apparently detoxify and act as a laxative, while the olive oil and grapefruit juice help detox. I bought these in a DIY kit, costing £10 in total.

I started on a Saturday at 5pm, after fasting all day and drinking only apple juice the day before, as recommended. I also swore off coffee and sugar, and refined carbohydrates, cheese and red meat, as recommended by the websites.

I took the first dose of Epsom salts and the olive oil and grapefruit juice. The mixture tasted so disgusting I nearly threw up, but I still continued with the second dose two hours later.

That night, my stomach was gripped with pain. By 3am I could not move from the bathroom, and woke feeling wretched and my head was spinning.

Liver cleanses vary, but with mine I could introduce juices and fruit after a day and a half.

By the third day, although the liver cleanse was over and I'd started my supplements, I still felt unwell. I drank gallons of dandelion tea as recommended, which did me no good. The worst thing was the headaches and crashing fatigue that had taken over.

By day four, I was also shivering and my muscles ached. I was convinced I had flu. I couldn't get up without feeling dizzy, and although I was managing a few smoothies, anything I ate made me more nauseous. I stayed in bed, drinking water.

After six days the worst was over, and although I gradually upped my food intake to include vegetables, chicken and brown rice as suggested, the headaches, fatigue and sore throat continued.

Finally, two weeks after starting the cleanse I threw my supplements away and went to see a doctor. He sent me for blood tests and prescribed medication to help calm the stomach.

 'I took the first dose of Epsom salts

The test results showed I had low lymphocytes. These make up about 38 per cent of white blood cells, and are responsible for immune function - making my low count likely to be behind my initial fatigue and ill health.

My extreme and sudden symptoms, however, were the result of the liver cleanse - giving up coffee, sugar and going on a near-starvation diet didn't help. And not eating properly was completely the wrong thing for someone with a compromised immune system.

My doctor said having low lymphocytes is not serious and is likely to have been caused by a viral infection. He advised me to rest, eat a balanced diet and take gentle exercise to help my immune system, and prescribed antibiotics as he said I had a chest infection.

I will soon have more tests to see if it improves naturally, but if my count has dropped further, other treatments will be considered.

But these won't include supplements, as Terence McCoy, a senior biochemical scientist at St Thomas's Hospital, London, specialising in immunology, explains: 'No dietary condition causes low lymphocytes. These mean the immune system is not working and a specialist would be the next logical step.'

Bedridden: The liver cleanse gave Kate headaches, crashing fatigue and nausea

It's a salutary reminder about the pitfalls of self-diagnosis online.

And as for a liver cleanse, the idea is a nonsense, says Ursula Arens, a nutritional scientist and a spokesperson for Sense About Science, a charity that campaigns for science-backed treatment.

'There is no evidence that demonstrates that the treatments and remedies available have any effect of decreasing toxins,' she says. 'The liver has specific enzymes that break down harmful toxins into harmless substances that are then secreted by the kidneys.

'You cannot influence the rate at which the liver produces enzymes or make them more efficient. The only way to optimise the liver is sensible lifestyle and eating habits.'

Limiting harmful substances such as alcohol and tobacco means the liver isn't overworked.

I wish I had seen my doctor at first instead of spending £150 on useless supplements and detoxes. It's been an expensive lesson.
