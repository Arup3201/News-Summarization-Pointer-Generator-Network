Violence has broken out in East Jerusalem as protesters clash with police following the murder of a Palestinian teenager in a suspected revenge attack for the death of three Israeli schoolboys.

Young Palestinian men threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at officers in both the Israeli capital and the West Bank city of Jenin, as special forces were sent to quell anger over the death of Mohammed Abu Khdair.

Officers discovered the charred and beaten body of the young Palestinian in woodland this morning, following reports of a person being forced into a car outside a supermarket near Shuafat.

The grim 
discovery came just hours after angry protests broke out over the murder
 of the three Jewish teens in the West Bank, during which some 
reportedly shouted 'death to the Arabs'.

Officers 
are investigating a possible connection between the murder and the 
reported kidnapping of Mohammed Abu Khdair in East Jerusalem earlier the
 same morning, a police spokesman said.

The
 incident occurred the day after Israel buried three teenagers who had 
been kidnapped near a Jewish settlement on June 12 and whose bodies were
 found in the West Bank on Monday.

Palestinian residents said they saw a teenager being forced into a vehicle outside the supermarket.

Micky
 Rosenfeld, a spokesman for Israeli police, said police had been 
notified of a youth 'pulled into a vehicle and possibly kidnapped' and 
roadblocks were set up in search of suspects.'

Later
 'police discovered a body in the Jerusalem forest and were looking to 
see if there was a connection between the missing youth and the body 
that was found,' Rosenfeld said.

A security source speaking on condition 
of anonymity said Israel suspected Mohammed Abu Khdair had been kidnapped and 
killed, possibly in retribution for the killings of the Israeli teens.

Amid heightened tensions following the discovery of the Palestinian teenager's body, violent protests broke out in East Jerusalem's Shuafat refugee camp.

Video
 footage posted online appears to show protesters throwing rocks at 
Israeli police, as special forces were sent in and roads closed around 
the area.

Despite calls for calm, Gaza militants were said by Israel to have fired a barrage of eight rockets towards 
southern Israel late last night, with around 20 rockets and mortars fired 
throughout the day.

It was also claimed that anti-rocket defences had intercepted two rockets, although there were no reports of casualties or damage.

The
 army said it carried out one airstrike on a mortar-launching site in 
Gaza, scoring a 'direct hit', and the heavy barrage late last night raised 
the likelihood of further Israeli reprisals.

Early Thursday, a 
rocket fired from Gaza slammed into a house in the southern Israeli 
border town of Sderot, causing heavy damage to the structure and a 
nearby road and knocking out electricity throughout town, according to the Israeli army.
 The family was huddled inside a shelter, and no one was hurt.

In response to the latest rocket barrage, the Israeli military
 said the air force carried out a 'precision strike' on 15 Hamas targets
 in Gaza overnight, including concealed rocket launchers, 
weapon-storage facilities and 'terror activity' sites. Ashraf al-Kidra, a
 Palestinian medical official, said ten people, all civilians, including 
three women, suffered light to moderate wounds.

Following the discovery of the Jewish teenagers' bodies, Israel has arrested dozens of Palestinians it says has links to Hamas. Here Israeli soldiers detains a blindfolded Arab in the West Bank City of Hebron this morning

Dozens
 of Israelis had protested in Jerusalem last night over the killing of 
the Israeli teens, and there were reports some had shouted 'death to the
 Arabs' at one of these demonstrations.

The
 bodies of Gil-Ad Shaer and U.S.-Israeli national Naftali Fraenkel, both
 16, and Eyal Yifrah, 19, were found in a field near Hebron, a militant 
stronghold, not far from a road where they were believed to have been 
abducted while hitchhiking, security officials said.

Israel has blamed Hamas Islamists for the kidnappings. The group had praised the abductions but not claimed responsibility.

'They were kidnapped and murdered in 
cold blood by beasts,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a 
statement after the military discovered the remains of the 
Jewish seminary students who disappeared on June 12. 'Hamas is 
responsible and Hamas will pay.'

Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri warned 
against escalation, saying that if Netanyahu 'brings a war on Gaza, the 
gates of hell will open to him.'

U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the killings but called on all parties to exercise restraint.

Yesterday morning Israel carried out a particularly intense series of 
airstrikes in Gaza, saying it had struck 34 targets across the 
Hamas-controlled territory.

The military said the airstrikes were a response to a barrage of 18 rockets fired into Israel since Sunday.
