The Colorado parents whose four children could only communicate in grunts when they were found living in a feces-ridden home previously had three other children taken from them, it has emerged.

Wayne Sperling, 66, and Lorinda Bailey, 35, were arrested and charged with four counts of felony child abuse after their four sons, aged two, four, five and six, were found living in a home littered with cat feces, flies and urine in Denver last month.

Records have now revealed that the couple also had three other children taken away from them in 2006 when they were discovered living in similarly appalling conditions during a welfare check.

Police were called to the home after two of the children, then aged two and four, were seen playing in the road and officers found the apartment door open, with only an upstairs neighbor watching them with a sound monitor, the police report shows.

Charged: Wayne 
Sperling, 66, and Lorinda Bailey, 35, were charged with child abuse after their sons were found in filthy conditions. They pleaded guilty to child abuse in 2007 after 3 other kids were also mistreated

Officers found that the eldest child was unable to speak properly and would only grunt and point, USA Today reported.

The children's faces were black with dirt and they wereÂ hungry and surrounded by trash, rotting food and insects, the criminal complaint noted. They were wearing unwashed clothing and 'reeked', it said.

Sperling and Bailey arrived home shortly afterwards with their three-month-old child and all three children were taken and put in protective care.

There are no details about their current whereabouts but they have different birth dates from the most recently found children, and records show all seven are the children of Sperling and Bailey.

Lashing out: Lorinda Bailey shouts at reporters while walking from the Denver Justice Center on the first day of her hearing on Tuesday. Her four malnourished sons were found living in a feces-covered home

The couple was later charged with 
three counts of child neglect and both pleaded guilty to a single 
misdemeanor count of child abuse in 2007 and were placed on probation 
for two years.

They were also ordered to take parenting classes and Sperling was ordered to undergo a mental-health evaluation, but it is not known if they fulfilled these requirements.

In the incident last month, police went to the home after Bailey took her two-year-old son to the hospital for a cut on his head, and doctors noticed he was dirty and smelled of cigarettes.

At the home, police officers reported a
strong smell of a decomposing animal coming from inside. They said the 
'smell became unbearable' as they entered the apartment.

They added that the smell seemed to be coming from a 
back room that was so full of flies 'they were covering every surface'. They also found two inches of cat 
feces under the bunk bed where the boys had slept.

'Sick': In 2006, Bailey's children were found covered in dirt and hungry after neighbors saw them playing in the road. She and Sperling were put on probation and ordered to take parenting classes

The children could only communicate with each other using 'infant-like noises', the report noted.

It also claimed all the children 
seemed to be about the same size, and they could not tell the age or 
developmental differences between the three oldest children. Two of the youngsters were wearing nothing but diapers.

Bailey waived her right to an attorney and 'stated she did not think the apartment was bad and stated she had seen Sperling clean and mop the floors,' the report said.

The children were placed in protective custody and all four were given medical examinations.

Sperling
and Bailey have been charged with four counts of felony child abuse. 
Bailey, who is free on bond, appeared in court Tuesday while Sperling 
remains in custody.

They are scheduled to return to court for a preliminary hearing October 29.

Questions: Family attorney David Littman, pictured in his law office opposite the home in Denver, said he called child welfare about concerns he had about the children - but that calls were ignored

Scene: A man walks past the residence of Sperling, where the four boys were found in deplorable conditions. Police records show that officers had previously responded to complaints

Since the recent case emerged, further records have revealed that child welfare knew about problems at the home for more than a year.

Caseworkers and police officers had even visited the home in Denver, Colorado but concluded the boys - who had to sleep on urine-soaked beds with no sheets - were 'fine', police reports show.

A family attorney, David Littman, who worked across the street from the home added that he called child welfare about the children after he saw them partially-clothed but his call was ignored.

Denver
County Department of Human Services officials said they could not 
discuss the case because of privacy laws and the state child welfare 
division opened a review of the incident.
