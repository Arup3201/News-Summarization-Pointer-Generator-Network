A very pregnant Chelsea Clinton looked like she was about to pop as she spoke at the Clinton Global Citizen Awards in New York on Sunday.

The star-studded gala hosted by Seth Myers and honored those, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who exemplify global leadership in various causes.

Chelsea's ready-to-pop appearance at the awards came just as a CNN sit-down with her dad aired on CNN in which the former president revealed his grandson or -daughter's impending delivery.

This big! Hillary also spoke at the gala, which was hosted by actor Seth Myers. Leonardo DiCaprio was honored at the event

During the television interview, the former US President said 'I hope by the first of October, I'll be a grandfather.' 

Clinton said he did not mind what the baby's gender was and said the family had decided not to find out.

'I don't know,' Clinton said.

'My daughter and son-in-law decided not to know. They want to be surprised.'

Last week Hillary Clinton told a crowd at political steak fry in Indianola, Iowa: 'Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch.'

'So don't be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage.'

Chelsea announced that she was pregnant with her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky in April. 

Last month she quit her $26,000-a-minute reporting job at NBC to focus on her baby. 

She had been working sporadically at the network since 2011 after winning a reported $600,000-a-year contract to report on stories featuring people or organizations doing public-spirited work. 

The network confirmed her exit on last month. She was initially hired to do stories for Brian Williams' 'Rock Center' news magazine but that program was canceled.

Her work occasionally appeared on NBC's Nightly News.

Politico magazine reported earlier this year that NBC was paying Clinton $600,000 annually before it was scaled back to a month-to-month deal in January.

Her last piece for the network aired on August 1.

Politico reported on Friday that Clinton's salary had worked out at an estimated $26,000 for each minute she appeared on air. 

Clinton and husband Marc, 36, celebrated their fourth-wedding anniversary at the end of last month. 

They were married in a lavish inter-faith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York on July 31, 2010. 

The couple live in a $10.5million condo in the Gramercy area of Manhattan.

News of the baby's impending arrival means  her mother's bid for presidency could soon become a reality.

Hillary Clinton vowed to postpone running for the nomination until she became a grandmother.

So heavily-pregnant Chelsea will have been a welcome sight to supporters of a second Clinton administration.

When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.' 

Last week Hillary Clinton told a crowd at political steak fry in Indianola, Iowa: 'Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch.''So don't be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage'

'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders,' she added.

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me. 

Hilary Clinton said the couple have chosen not to find out the gender of their new arrival.
