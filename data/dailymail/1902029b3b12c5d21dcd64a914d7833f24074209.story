A father has hit back at critics who left racist comments on a picture of him adeptly taking care of his two young daughters.

When Los Angeles, California resident Doyin Richards shared a photo of himself cradling his baby girl in an Ergo while brushing his other daughter's hair, the post went viral.

But some commenters took issue with the color of his skin, making cruel assumptions about his lifestyle.

'I would bet anything that you're a deadbeat,' one nasty commenter wrote on his blog Daddy Doin' Work, while another said: 'Cute picture. Now why don't you hand the children back to their mom so you can go back to selling drugs or your bootleg rap CDs?'

Internet controversy: When Doyin Richards shared this photo of himself cradling his baby girl in an Ergo while brushing his other daughter's hair, the post went viral, receiving both positive and negative feedback

While some of the critics made offensive remarks about his race, others commented on the fact that his children, who are three months old and three years old in the photo, don't share his exact same skin color.

'He probably rented those kids. They don't even look like him,' one commenter said about his daughters, whose mother Mariko is half-white and half-Japanese.

Another suggested that being a doting father as an African American man shows weakness, writing: 'Look at this Uncle Tom. No chance he would be doing this if his kids were black.'

Surprisingly, Mr Richards notes that many of the people posting racist comments were actually black men like himself, who had negative things to say about his mixed-race wife and daughters.

'I'm sorry, but I can't support a brotha who didn't marry a black woman,' wrote one such critic.

To these people, Mr Richards hit back by referring to Dr Martin Luther King, Jr.

'I have a dream that people will view a picture like this and not think it's such a big deal'

'Grow up and stop being so f****** ignorant,' he wrote. ‘You're a damn embarrassment to Dr King and his legacy.'

The 
father-of-two added: 'If the first thing you want to do is to criticize 
the skin color of my kids for not being as dark as mine, you have some 
serious issues.'

In the beginning of his post, which 
was shared in October, Mr Richards explains that he took the month off 
from work for 'baby bonding' with his daughter, who was then three 
months old.

He snapped the picture one particular 
morning to prove to his wife that he could get both daughters ready for 
school - including styling the older girl's hair - without her help.

Ignorance: Some critics made offensive remarks about his race, and others commented on the fact that his children, who are half black, a quarter Japanese and a quarter white, don't share his exact same skin color

Cruel assumptions: 'He probably rented those kids. They don't even look like him,' one commenter said about his daughters, whose mother Mariko (pictured) is half-white and half-Japanese

Mr Richards explained that he 
accomplished the task by putting his baby in the Ergo, standing his 
three-year-old on a stool and 'working my hair magic'.

'After 15 minutes of multitasking, the 
final result was a nice, tight ponytail for big sister and a happily 
sleeping baby in the carrier. Mission accomplished,' wrote the proud father on his parenting blog.

Little did he know the passionate response he would inspire by posting the photo on his Facebook and Twitter pages.

Within hours, the photo had thousands of views, 'likes', shares and comments - some of them overwhelmingly negative.

Not only did he receive racist comments, but he was also dishearted that there was such a strong
 reaction at all to his photo, since he believes men who are devoted parents like him 
should be the norm, not the exception.

Hitting back: 'Grow up and stop being so f****** ignorant,' he wrote to his critics, many of whom are black men like himself. 'You're a damn embarrassment to Dr King and his legacy'

Taking a stand: The devoted father-of-two added: 'If the first thing you want to do is to criticize the skin color of my kids for not being as dark as mine, you have some serious issues'

'I have a dream that people will view a picture like this and not think it's such a big deal,' he wrote.

'Think of the Mommy blogs you like to 
follow,' he said. 'If they share their love for motherhood, you probably
 wouldn't think twice about it because that's what moms are "supposed to
 do," right?'

'If the first thing you want to do is to criticize 
the skin color of my kids, you have some 
serious issues'

He added: 'Until we can get to the point where men and women can complete the same parenting tasks and the reactions are the same, we will have problems.'

He said of his love of fatherhood: 'Being a dad is one of the few things in life I'm actually good at. Of course I'm going to be passionate about this gig.'

This post has garnered more than 230 comments on Mr Richards' blog, with many of his followers showing their support for him.

'What enrages me about this situation is that it only became a negative situation because you're a non-white dad raising mixed raise kids,' wrote one mother-of-seven from Mississippi.

Good parent: 'We really need to change the narrative on what fatherhood is all about, get more changing tables in men's bathrooms, do all these things to help celebrate the great dads of the world,' he said

Backlash: One of his supporters commented: 'I can't believe anyone would look at a picture like this and find a way to take issue with something. Spending time actually raising your kids is a gift'

'The photo you posted melted my heart. It drew negative attention because you're not supposed to be a positive influence in their lives,' she wrote.

'You're supposed to be a dead beat. . . because that's what the societal mold would dictate, and they don't know how to process the fact that you don't fit into it.'

One fellow doting dad said that he could relate to his dedication to parenting. 'Many fathers relinquish parenting duties to the mother, and take a back seat,' he wrote. 'This was never what I had in mind for my own child.'

Another commented: 'I can't believe anyone would look at a picture like this and find a way to take issue with something. Spending time actually raising your kids is a gift for both you and them.'
