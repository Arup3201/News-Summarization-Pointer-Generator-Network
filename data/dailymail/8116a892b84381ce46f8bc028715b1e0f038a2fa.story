England goalkeeper Ben Foster has signed a new four-year deal with West Brom, the Barclays Premier League club have announced.

The 31-year-old, who joined the Baggies permanently in 2012, also has an option for a further 12 months and is now effectively tied to the Hawthorns outfit until 2019.

Foster has just returned from the World Cup where he won his eighth cap in the 0-0 draw with Costa Rica.

Happy: West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster has extended his contract with the club until 2019

'This is fantastic news for everyone connected with the club as Ben’s an extremely important player for us - both on and off the pitch,' said head coach Alan Irvine.

'He’s a great personality, a great character and leads by example.

'This is a magnificent signing for the club.

'Ben is one of the best keepers in the country, which he showed when he played really well for England against Costa Rica at the World Cup.

'Ben is extremely professional, which is infectious in training, as he demands high standards of himself and others.'

Foster initially signed for Albion on a season-long loan from midlands rivals Birmingham in 2011, keeping 10 clean sheets in 37 appearances and earning himself a full-time move.

And the former Manchester United stopper is now hoping he can end his career at the Hawthorns.

'When I signed here permanently, I said this is the sort of club I could see myself finishing my career at,' he said.

'And that’s exactly how I felt when the club said they wanted to negotiate a new contract.

'It was something I wanted to get sorted as soon as possible. I’m very happy here.

'It was a very obvious and easy decision for me and my family.'

Settled: Foster has talked about finishing his career at West Brom

Foster began his professional career at Stoke but never made an appearance for the Potters, instead going out on a series of loan moves before a 2005 transfer to United.

Two seasons on loan at Watford followed and while Foster was touted by many to be Edwin van der Sar’s replacement at Old Trafford, he could never displace the Dutchman and moved to Birmingham in 2010.

Relegation followed in 2011, prompting a move back to the top flight and the Hawthorns.
