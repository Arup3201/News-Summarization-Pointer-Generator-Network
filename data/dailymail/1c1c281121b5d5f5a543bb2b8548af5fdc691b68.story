The mysterious world of espionage, top secret missions and adventure has intrigued children for generations.

Now MI5 and Blue Peter, the BBC’s long running children’s programme, have teamed up to try to find potential 007s of the future.

As part of a unique competition, three lucky youngsters will be offered the chance to go on a very special mission behind the scenes at HM Secret Services, in London.

Their visit to MI5 headquarters will be filmed for the programme - the first time television cameras have ever been allowed into the top secret building at Thames House.

The decision by MI5 to open its doors to television cameras is a milestone in the history of the secret services and a move away from its shadowy past.

Viewers aged between the ages of eight and 14 will be invited to apply to ‘Project Petra’ – named after one of the show’s earliest pets – through the Blue Peter website to see if they have what it takes to become a spy.

The top eight candidates will be invited to attend a special ‘spy school’ weekend, where they will be put through their paces in a rigorous selection procedure consisting of mental and physical challenges. Three will eventually be chosen to head to the secret base.

Bestselling author Anthony Horowitz, who has written the Alex Rider series of books about a teenage agent, is on the selection panel to find the three CBBC Intelligence Officers.

Horowitz - also the writer of ITV’s secret service drama Foyle’s War – said: ‘Children are fascinated by the world of spies and secret intelligence and so, for that matter, am I.

‘I’m really thrilled to have been invited to join this top secret panel, it’s going to be a real adventure.’

The contest was launched on tonight's edition of Blue Peter.

Editor Ewan Vinnicombe said: ‘Project Petra is one of the most exciting opportunities Blue Peter has ever given its audience.

‘We’re always looking for new ways to help kids understand the world around them and join in with our content and this is a brilliant example of how we can do this on the show, both for the kids taking part and the audience watching on TV and online.’

Cheryl Taylor, controller of CBBC, said: ‘We’re aware that children are fascinated by the mysterious world of intelligence and we’re thrilled to be in a position to feed their passion for intrigue and adventure with this unique proposition.

‘With MI5 and Anthony Horowitz on board we know they will be awestruck by the expert credentials of our partners in this once in a lifetime CBBC opportunity.’

Progress made by the domestic intelligence agency – once notoriously paranoid about hiring gay employees, who were banned until the early Nineties - was further noted earlier this week when it was named among the top ten gay-friendly employers.

Campaign group Stonewall described the secret services as making ‘incredible progress’ in hiring gay, lesbian and bisexual workers in a relatively short period of time.
