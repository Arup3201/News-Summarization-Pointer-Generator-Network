A British show jumper was among hundreds trapped in the terror and chaos aboard a blazing ferry in the Adriatic Sea yesterday.

Nick Channing-Williams, 37, was one of the 478 people who became stranded when a fire broke out on the car deck of the Italian-flagged Norman Atlantic off the Greek island of Corfu.

Passengers, who were travelling from the Greek port of Patras to Ancona, Italy, became trapped on the top decks as gales and choppy seas hampered evacuation efforts.

One passenger has died and another was injured while attempting to escape the stricken ferry.

Giovanni Pettorino, an Italian coastguard official, said one person had died while being rescued from the Italian-flagged Norman Atlantic.

Authorities confirmed there were 423 passengers and 55 crew members on board and said more than half of them remain trapped on the ferry as the rescue operation is being hampered by choppy seas and bad weather. 

The fire broke out on the lower car deck of the passenger ferry, which was also carrying 222 vehicles,  just before 6am local time (4am GMT).

Some passengers have reportedly been stranded on an upper deck of the ferry for more than eight hours, as they are unable to be lowered to lifeboats due to the high seas.

Some called TV stations in desperation, saying: ‘We are burning and sinking, no one can save us,’ as the vessel was battered by 55mph winds.

Others told how the blaze swept through the vessel, fuelled by vats of olive oil in trucks catching light.

Passengers remain trapped on the blazing ferry, off the coast of Corfu, as gale-force winds and choppy seas hamper the rescue effort. The vessel caught alight at 6am local time with 478 passengers and crew on board 

They also described how their shoes melted in the heat and the smell of plastic pervaded the corridors. On deck, passengers were battered by rain and lightning storms.

As darkness fell last night, thick smoke engulfed the ferry, and passengers – among the 300 believed to be still on board – said the ship had begun to list to one side.

Italian and Greek helicopter crews prepared to work through the night to airlift passengers in pairs as the ferry was being towed after it drifted in fierce winds into Albanian waters.

‘There’s a lot of smoke, we can’t breathe,’ passenger Nikos Papatheodosiou told Greece’s state-run Nerit television yesterday evening. ‘Panic, there’s panic,’ he said.

A Greek government official said one man had died and, as night fell, authorities said 165 passengers had been rescued.

The cause of the fire was not immediately clear but Greek media reported it may have spread because of the burning olive oil.

Dorothy Channing-Williams last night said her son Nick, a competitive show jumper and trainer, and his Greek fiancée Regina Theoffili were still on board.

She added: ‘There’s about 300 people still on board and it is the cold that’s most difficult.’

Mr Channing-Williams – whose late father Simon produced the Oscar-winning film The Constant Gardener and the Bafta-winning Vera Drake – is believed to be one of two Britons on board.

A tearful Mrs Channing-Williams said her son first made contact at 4am but urged her not to worry.

She said: ‘He said that he had been on the top deck for the last seven hours with rain, and thunder and lightning, but he was making light of it because he knew I would be so worried. They’ve apparently blocked all people’s mobiles because they thought it was hampering the rescue effort.’

The 70-year-old, from Newbury, Berkshire, added: ‘He called me to let me know that he’s okay and that Regina’s okay.’

Other panic-stricken passengers called TV stations and pleaded for help. Sofoklis Styliaras called Mega TV from his mobile, saying: ‘The fire is still burning. On the lower deck, where the lifeboats are, our shoes were starting to melt...there’s nowhere else for us to go.’

Italian and Greek helicopter crews prepared to work through the night to airlift passengers, who described their shoes melting in the searing heat 

Another, Giorgos Stiliaras, said those on board were having trouble breathing with all the smoke. ‘We are outside, we are very cold, the ship is full of smoke,’ he said. ‘The boat is still burning, the floors are boiling.’ Speaking from a hospital in Italy, 

Vassiliki Tavrizelou, who was rescued along with her two-year-old daughter, spoke to the media from her hospital bed in Lecce, southern Italy. 

She said: 'They called first on women and children to be evacuated from the ship.

'Ships could not approach us because of the rain and winds. We were at least four hours on the deck, in the cold and rain.'

She recalled the ship alarm going off and seeing fire from her cabin. 'Then we heard explosions,' she said.  

A Greek coastguard spokesman said: ‘We are making superhuman efforts in this extremely difficult operation. Operations by air will continue throughout the night.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Two British nationals are believed to be on board. We are urgently seeking more information.’
