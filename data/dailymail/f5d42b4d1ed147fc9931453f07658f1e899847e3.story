Premier League clubs will fly over 175,000 miles this summer to fulfil pre-season fixtures in all four corners of the globe.

Despite there being just 34 days between the World Cup final and the start of the Premier League season, all but one of the 20 top flight clubs are jetting off overseas as part of their preparations.

These whistle-stop tours underline once again the massive value clubs place on exploiting commercial opportunities in foreign markets, with Bangkok, New Zealand and the United States all on the agenda for English football's elite.

The air miles total of 176,164 miles is down on last year's record 199,701, with clubs seeming to take into consideration the physical demands of the World Cup on squad members - to a certain extent.

But any hope of a decent rest, perhaps interspersed with a few local fixtures, is a pipedream for the players as they hurtle into another campaign.

Surprisingly, Newcastle United and West Ham United are the biggest travellers, with each heading on two-match tours of New Zealand.

And in another mirror of their pre-season diaries, both will then head to Gelsenkirchen in Germany to play in the Schalke 04 Cup.

The United States is by far the most popular destination this summer, apparently replacing the Far East as favoured destination for the leading clubs.

Arsenal, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Swansea City, Tottenham and West Bromwich are all heading Stateside, with Liverpool, City and United taking part in the annual Guinness International Champions Cup.

By contrast, the only Far East fixture is the meeting of Everton and newly-promoted Leicester City in Bangkok on July 27, this being an off year for the Premier League Asia Trophy.

Chelsea, who toured both Asia and the States a year ago, will only cover a fraction of the distance with matches in Klagenfurt, Ljubljana, Arnhem, Bremen and Budapest on a European tour.

Hull City are the only one of the 20 choosing not to fly abroad, with matches scheduled against North Ferriby, Harrogate, York and Barnsley.
