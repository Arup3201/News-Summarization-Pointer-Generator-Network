Devastated: Mark Fear, 55, was found hanging at his £500,000 home just four months after the death of Kenneth Kendall, his partner of 23 years

Broadcaster Kenneth Kendall left his estate to his devoted partner – who killed himself rather than face life without him.

Records released last week show that Kendall, who died last December of a stroke, aged 88, left assets worth £408,285 to Mark Fear, his partner of 23 years.

Mr Fear, 55, hanged himself in April at their home in Cowes.

Friends told an inquest in January how the death of Mr Kendall - best known for presenting the hit 
series Treasure Hunt with Anneka Rice - had had a 'radical effect' on 
the art gallery owner who was known by his middle name Mark.

Neil Robertson
said that Mr Kendall's death had hit Mr Fear hard and with 
his partner, Miss Wyatt, they had attempted to help him cope with his 
grief.

He said: 'It had a radical effect on him.'

'He
had concerns on a number of levels, principally the grief after losing 
his partner, concerns about the viability of the business and the 
economic status given the role Kenneth his partner played in providing 
income and presence in the gallery.'

He was found with a note left by his body at the three-bedroom home he had shared with his civil partner.

Addressed to his friend Vicki Wyatt, it read: 'I am sorry to land you in all this.

TV presenter: Kenneth Kendall, pictured presenting the Nine O'Clock News on BBC1 in 1971, died of a stroke last December

'I simply cannot face the future without Kenneth. M x'

The former interior designer also left instructions for her to look at the Notes application in his iPhone where his will and other documents could be found.

Mr Fear had met the former presenter of Channel 4's Treasure Hunt in London and the couple had entered into a civil partnership in 2006.

They opened the Kendall Fine Art gallery on the Isle of Wight together where they moved following the presenter's retirement.

Career: Kendall, far right, was revealed as one of the new BBC announcers in 1960 along with Michael Aspel , Judith Chalmers , Nan Wilson and Kenneth Kendall
