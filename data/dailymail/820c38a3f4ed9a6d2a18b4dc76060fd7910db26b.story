Have you ever wondered what you have to do to keep your man's eye from wandering? One woman thinks she has the answer - it involves a scalpel and some silicone. 

Self-titled sex expert Louise Van Der Velde is telling women who reach their forties to get plastic surgery or face their partner running off with a younger model. 

Louise, who runs a relationship therapy centre in central London, believes ladies only have themselves to blame if their husband starts to find other women more attractive.

Louise Van Der Velde, 41, runs a relationship therapy centre in London, she believes women only have themselves to blame if their man cheats and should get plastic surgery to stay desirable 

She said: 'I think for the people who do want to have a monogamous relationship – the women are very quick to point the finger.

'They say that their husband is messing about and he’s left them for someone else, but I think it is absolutely the woman's responsibility when they have let themselves go over the years.

'We are the creators of our own destiny, if your fella cheats, you’ve created it yourself. 

'The men have a right to look elsewhere, they have a right to be sleeping with an attractive woman.' 

Apparently it could be worse though, while British and American women are not in good shape, Louise reserves her harshest criticism for ladies from some of the countries on the European mainland.

She said: ' I lived in Spain for fifteen years and the women there, they age because they eat all of these cakes and bread.

'A lot of the women, when they hit 50 they are pretty much a write-off in some of those countries, but it doesn’t have to be that way.'

Louise provides advice for women whose men have been unfaithful 

Steering clear of cakes and keeping in shape with regular visits to the gym is not enough though - Louise thinks that women should start to have breast augmentation, liposuction, fillers and the rest as soon as parts of the body start to sag. 

She said: 'A lot of my female clients in their forties and fifties come in and they’re unhappy that their husbands are playing away but they’ve let themselves go.  

'But no one’s really happy with themselves when they are overweight and not looking good.

'Even when you buy a new dress you feel good – looking good is feeling good.

'I actively encourage my clients to get plastic surgery and it’s received fairly well.

'I have had the odd client who think they should be accepted for who they are but some of them have taken it up.

'I’ve had some ladies who have had liposuction done for their weight and some who've had the gastric band. 

'There are also some who've had their eyes and breasts done as well.

'Faces get saggy and a little bit of filler is good, it’s very important that you find the right surgeon though. 

'Some of the TOWIE girls go totally over the top and they begin looking like this plastic. It doesn’t have to be like that.

'If you have a good surgeon, they’ll do it the right way.' 

Louise claims to have had serious success with her pro-plastic surgery approach to healing marriages. 

But sometimes the effects can be so strong that the balance in the relationship swings completely the other way. 

Louise thinks that men should be allowed to look elsewhere if their partner has let themselves go

She said: 'This one woman had a boob job and it gave her a totally new lease of life.

'She decided that as her husband had cheated on her, she was going to go off anyway.

'I take my hat off to those types of women as well because I think that maybe they had been staying in the relationship because they had settled and couldn’t get anyone better.'  

While Louise acknowledges that her comments may seem harsh and quite extreme, she is quick to point out that she practises what she preaches and has undergone extensive cosmetic surgery herself. 

She said: 'People say to me it’s easy because I am a natural beauty but I work really hard to look like this. 

'I decided that in my fortieth year I wanted to be the fittest I’ve ever been, so I had my boobs done.

'I  first had them done eight years ago, back then I was a 34C and went up to a 34DD and now I’m a 34 E.

'I also had under my eyes done – I had the wrinkles taken out, I’ve  also had my lips done.  

'Everybody says that they can’t believe I’m 40, they all think that I look like I’m 30 and that’s a great feeling. 

'I don’t believe in growing old gracefully.' 

It seems that Louise isn't alone in her desire to stay looking fresh as soon as the big 4-0 looms, more and more surgeons are experiencing the an influx of forty-something women checking in for adjustments. 

Mr Ash Mosahebi, who performed Louise's surgery at Spire Bushey Hospital said: 'I have seen a rise in patients wanting to remain younger at a younger age. 

'Previously women would have come to see me in their fifties or sixties, I am now seeing more women in their forties. 

The most popular procedures for women of this age are breast uplifts, liposuction and blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery).'

There are some who ARE allowed to grow old gracefully though - Men. 

While women should get plastic surgery to hide the signs of ageing, Louise believes that men only need to keep in shape by eating well and heading to the gym. 

She said: 'I think men are more fortunate, they age better than women and they become more distinguished. 

'So obviously they need to keep themselves fit, but as far as surgery, they get away with lines and things like that.

'I don’t think there is as much emphasis on the men needing to do it.'
