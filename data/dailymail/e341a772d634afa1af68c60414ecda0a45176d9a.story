Ask Andy Murray about the most memorable victories in his career and quickly revealed are two aspects of his character — the modest and the contrarian.

There is no mention of ending Britain’s Wimbledon men’s singles drought, nor the similar emulating of Fred Perry at the US Open, nor the flaying he gave Roger Federer on Centre Court to win the Olympic gold medal.

Instead, he refers to a win over an obscure journeyman ranked No 110 in the world, and another at a now-defunct and largely-forgotten tournament in California.

Andy Murray warms up for match against Kevin Anderson in Miami on Monday

The subject arises because he has the opportunity to win a 500th professional singles match on Tuesday, when he takes on South Africa’s world No 15 Kevin Anderson in the fourth round of the Miami Open.

It comes around nearly 12 years after making his professional debut as a 15-year-old in Manchester. He began with a victory over Wesley Moodie, another South African. Moodie was only just outside the top 100 at the time, so it was a fair indication of his opponent’s outstanding promise.

Murray does not mention that one, but recalls two of the matches that set him on his way, and most clearly the period when he was trying to establish himself on the main ATP Tour.

‘I remember certain wins, like the first one I had at Queen’s (at the then Stella Artois Championships in 2005) against Santiago Ventura,’ he says, referring to the then world No 110.

‘It might seem irrelevant now but at the time, for me, that was huge. It was big for my confidence, gave me a sense of belonging. I really remember those first few events on the tour, more than some of those in the last three or four years.

‘I can remember the players I played against around then. I went to Newport (Rhode Island) after my first Wimbledon and then I played in Indianapolis and Cincinnati.’

By the end of that summer, not long after turning 18, he was already knocking on the door of the top 100 and had beaten three players inside the top 30.

Early in 2006 comes the other match he picks out, the final of the indoor San Jose Open, where he beat former Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt.

‘That was a first ATP title for me and was really important,’ he says. ‘I was without a coach, only 18, and Lleyton was someone I loved watching growing up. To win 7-6 in the third set at that age against someone as good as him, with no coach there, privately meant a lot.

‘I didn’t really feel the pressure — it was, “Here I am, I’m 18 and playing an ex-No 1 in the world, a great player and nothing is expected”.

‘I played (Andy) Roddick in the semis and didn’t feel nervous at all. It definitely changes over the years, you start to feel the expectation but then as you get older it changes again as you start to deal with the expectation and learn how to handle it.’

Interestingly, ask which win took the most out of him and he instead cites one of his 155 defeats, the near five-hour loss in the 2012 Australian Open semi-final to Novak Djokovic. The Serb subsequently managed probably the most talked about recovery in history, beating Rafael Nadal two days later in nearly six hours to win the title.

‘Against Novak in the Australian Open was the hardest match, I’ve no idea how he managed to recover and win the final. I literally couldn’t walk for four days. That was the match my body hurt the most after finishing. I was extremely sore, stiff, everything hurt.’

Murray is guaranteed to overtake Nadal in next week’s rankings after his defeat on Sunday by Fernando Verdasco.

The Spaniard heads to Monte Carlo to begin what is usually a triumphant roll through the European clay courts admitting he is lacking confidence and that he ‘needs to fix again’ the nerves that have affected him this season. The 28-year-old insisted there are no hidden physical issues behind his modest 15-5 record this year.

Normally the mere feel of the dirt under his feet imbues Nadal with belief, and with Djokovic targeting Roland Garros above all else this year, he will need all of that.
