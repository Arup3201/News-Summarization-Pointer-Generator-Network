A man banned from the gym over fears for his health has had half his brain disabled by surgeons to end years of debilitating seizures. 

Fitness fanatic Lewis Unwin suffered countless fits and constant shaking as a teenager, having been diagnosed with a rare brain condition. 

The 21-year-old had been banned from going to the gym, over fears he would suffer epileptic seizures.

But today, his dream of becoming a personal trainer has been reignited after he opted for life-changing surgery to disconnect half his brain.

Lewis Unwin, 21, from Hornchuch in Essex was diagnosed with Rasmussen syndrome in 2011 after suffering a seizure on holiday in Minorca in August 2007

Determined to pursue his dream of becoming a personal trainer, Mr Unwin opted to have a hemispherectomy operation where surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London disconnected half of his brain, disabling the nerve cells which had been malfunctioning causing him to suffer seizures almost 24 hours a day

He said: 'The seizures are still going on in the right-side of my brain - it's just the signals have been cut off from being passed to my left side.

'I used to shake and suffered fits all the time.

'The pain was excruciating - it felt like my bones were breaking every time I had one.

'It was a tough decision to have the operation but I just knew I needed to get my life back.

'It was the only step forward I could take.'

Mr Unwin first noticed something was wrong after suffering a seizure during a family holiday to Minorca in August 2007.

His condition deteriorated and left him suffering epileptic seizures almost 24 hours a day. 

In 2011, after rounds of tests, doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital diagnosed Mr Unwin with Rasmussen's syndrome.

Mr Unwin, said: 'It was a tough decision to have the operation but I just knew I needed to get my life back'

Today the 21-year-old is working as a gym instructor having been allowed back to train. He had been banned from exercising in the gym over fears for his health and safety were he to suffer a fit

Rasmussen syndrome is a rare condition that is usually diagnosed in three to 11-year-olds. It is not known what causes it, but nerve cells in regions of the brain malfunction to cause epileptic seizures

The rare brain condition is usually seen in three to 11-year-olds, causing frequent epileptic seizures.

The cause of the condition is unknown, but pioneering surgery called a 'hemispherectomy' - which involved disconnecting and disabling one side of the brain - has allowed Mr Unwin to regain control of his life.

He was left completely paralysed following the eight-hour operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London on August 25, 2011.

Rasmussen syndrome is a very rare form of brain malfunction, which can happen at any time during childhood.

It most commonly affects children aged three to 11, but can be seen in younger children, teenagers and adults.

It is not known what causes the condition, but brain cells in one hemisphere of the brain become very inflamed and swollen.

There is no evidence of viral infection causing the inflammation in most cases, although research has found very rarely a virus is detected.

It is thought a virus may trigger an antibody response by the brain, which in turn causes the inflammation and malfunction of the brain.

The nerve cells malfunction, causing seizures.

They can occur frequently, often many times a day.

In some cases the seizures can become continuous.

A child can develop a weakness of one side of the body as a result of the seizures.

And in some cases a sufferer can develop learning or behaviour problems as the condition worsens.

Patients can be treated using epilepsy drugs and medicines to suppress or alter the immune system can also be used.

For some, where the disorder is confiend to specific parts of the brain, doctors can remove or disconnect the affect regions of the brain.

But the football-mad West Ham fan stunned doctors by learning to walk within two weeks of the op, kicking a football after just four weeks.

He added: 'It's always been my dream to be a personal trainer.

'I used to have to take drugs every day and my condition meant I wasn't allowed into the gym because of fears over health and safety.

'It's great to be able to get back into the gym. I've had to learn to adapt and have retrained my body.

'I've had to teach myself to walk and talk again but I've had amazing support from everybody which has really helped.'

Mr Unwinlives at his family home in Hornchurch, Essex, with his parents Gary Unwin, and full-time mother Kay Unwin, both 47, and his younger sister Holly, 15.

His parents had been warned he may never speak again ahead of the pioneering operation - but were relieved when he woke up from surgery singing the Alicia Keys hit Empire State of Mind (New York).

Father Gary, a black cab driver, said: 'We were really worried ahead of the operation.

'We had been told he might not be able to talk or that his memory could be affected.

'All of a sudden I heard him singing that New York by Alicia Keys as he woke up.

'It was a huge relief for us to know he was okay.'

The 21-year-old has now started work as a gym instructor at Central Park Leisure Centre in Harold Hill. 

He said: 'When I first came back to the gym I was very intimidated.

'You worry that people are looking at you because of your disability and the fact I still wear a brace on my leg.

'I still have problems with weakness on my left side but I've learnt to adapt.

'I will not let my disability hold me back and I want to teach people that message.

'I'm really excited about using my experiences to help inspire other people with disabilities to get fit and healthy.'
