Liverpool legend Dietmar Hamann has revealed that if he was in charge at the club he would only have signed under-fire striker Mario Balotelli as a last resort in the summer transfer window.

Hamann, who last week criticised Balotelli for swapping shirts with Real Madrid’s Pepe at half-time while the Reds were 3-0 down against the Spanish giants, says he would have evaluated every other option available before signing the controversial Italian.

In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail at the London Sports Writing Festival he said: ‘I would have taken Balotelli on the last day of the window, but not before.

Liverpool legend Dietmar Hamann says the club should have signed Balotelli only as a last resort 

‘I would have tried to look at every other option which was out there to see if the right player could be found and a deal could be done.

‘And then on the last day if you don’t get anyone and he (Balotelli) is still keen on coming to the club I would have taken him, but I wouldn’t have taken him a week before – that’s for sure.

‘Having said that I’d rather have him at the club than not have him at all, because I think he can produce the moments of magic which can win you games. We just haven’t seen that yet.'

Despite his criticism of Balotelli last week, Hamann insists the 24-year-old is being made a scapegoat at Liverpool to disguise their poor form, with the Reds already eight points off leaders Chelsea, having played a game more.

He added: ‘He is part of a team that is struggling and is not playing well but all the blame seems to be directed onto him – he’s an easy target.

‘He is not playing any differently to what he has done in the last five years. You know what you’re getting with Balotelli, and the only difference with him now to previous years is that he’s not scoring.

‘I don’t think he’s as good as people make out but he is a very talented player and could be a success at Liverpool.

‘I’ve been critical of Mario recently (the shirt swapping incident), but I feel the criticism elsewhere has been overboard in particular after the Real Madrid game.

‘He shouldn’t have swapped shirts with Pepe but ultimately it had no bearing on the result and the way Liverpool played.

‘They’ve been under par most of the season and have struggled for results and that isn’t Mario’s fault. He needs support now from everyone at Liverpool because the last thing he needs is people hitting him over the head with a sledgehammer.’
