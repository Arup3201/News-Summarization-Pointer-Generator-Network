The Oakland Raiders earned their first win in more than a year on Thursday as rookie quarterback Derek Carr rallied the team with a late scoring drive to stun division rivals Kansas City 24-20.

With the Raiders (1-10) trailing 20-17 in the fourth quarter, Carr marched the team 80 yards downfield in a drive that took seven minutes off the clock and culminated with a nine-yard touchdown pass to James Jones.

Kansas City had little time to recover and could only make it to their own 48 yard line with their last possession, which ended with Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith throwing an incompletion on fourth down.

It was Oakland's first win since beating Houston on November 17, 2013 and snapped a 16-game losing streak. Watching on was boxer Amir Khan who posed with Manchester born Raiders star Menelik Watson before the game. 

The defeat halted the Chiefs' (7-4) five-game win streak and saw them drop out of a tie for first place in the AFC West.

The only sour note for the Raiders was the loss of first-year running back Latavius Murray, who had dominated the first half with 112 yards and two touchdowns but exited with a concussion in the second quarter.
