Heiress and society 'it' girl Tamara Ecclestone caused a stir last year when she revealed that she had spent an unbelievable £1m on a crystal bathtub.

Miss Ecclestone ‘dispatched’ five minions on an 
expedition up the Amazon to gather the crystal used to create the state-of- the-art bathtub for her £47m London home, but if you have been inspired by her blinging bathroom you only need to go as far as London department store Harrods.

The Catchpole & Rye Crystal Bateau is a tad cheaper too, priced at £150,000.

The Swarovski Crystal Petit Bateau bath from Catchpole & Rye takes over 200 man hours to create and will set you back £150,000

The all white crystals appear to give a uniform glitter, but four different types of Swarovski crystals are used to obtain the effect

Forget paying off the mortgage or 
putting your children through private school — for £150,000 (or 
just £120,000 for a slightly smaller Baby Bateau) craftsmen will laboriously stick 22,000 white Swarovski crystals 
to a hand-made cast-iron tub for a glittery Saturday Night Fever effect.

Catchpole & Rye
 is the only bathroom company who manufacture exclusively in England and
 the bath is made in their Kent foundry using traditional methods and 
employing artisan techniques in every part of the process.

The claw footed bath is a surefire way to add some glamour to your bathroom, and can be covered in different colours of crystal such as pink, blue or green

Why not bling up your bathroom with a Swarovski encrusted tub from Catchpole & Rye?

The bath is made from cast metal with an enamel interior, and thousands
 of crystals have been painstakingly applied by hand taking over 200 
hundred hours to turn the Swarovski Element Saracen bath into a real 
object d’art.

The Swarovski
 crystals are all white, of four different plates and applied in 
meticulous fashion, each being individually stuck on by hand to 
emphasise the light refracting properties of the glass and create a 
truly sparkling effect.

Tamara Ecclestone's extravagant tub is part of the growing trend of bling bathrooms

Tamara's bathtub was created from crystal specially sourced from the Amazon, and required her bathroom floor to be enhanced to take its weight

Catchpole & Rye use traditional methods and craftsmanship to create the baths- which are made-to-order

Catchpole & Rye have also created a bejewelled version of their beautiful ‘Baby Bateau’ bath, which  carries the slightly cheaper price tag of £120,000.

Four different types of Swarovski crystal are used on the bath as a single size failed to create the right level of razzle-dazzle reflection.

Sticking on thousands of tiny crystals is an unfeasibly intricate process and the craftsmen at Catchpole and Rye have come up with a rather ingenious solution.

They apply the crystals using the end of a pencil covered in Bluetac!

This allows them to individually pick up and place the crystals onto the bath where they are glued into position.

The baby bath is finished with thousands of a single style of crystal creating a consistent glittering effect.

And
 if white isn't your thing, the made-to-order tub can be covered in 
several shades of Swarovski crystal options, including gold, blue and green 
crystals.

Personal customisation is available, and Catchpole & Rye will painstakingly spell out names or even create crests and logos in different coloured crystals.

Managing Director Tony O'Donnell says of creating the spectacular, and unusual bath: 'It was to do something exotic. We did a job for a princess in the middle east and she was very much into her bling, and that's where the idea stems from.'

Defending the tubs undeniably hefty price tag Tony says: 'If you have the money, you want the bath, then the price isn't the issue 

'There is a huge amount of work that goes into it, hundreds of hours, it's all English craftsmanship

'It's a one off; where are you going to see another one like it? The reflection off it is just amazing'

The tub is being displayed at the Catchpole & Rye showroom in Kent, and is also available to buy from Harrods.

And while you are thinking of upgrading your bath then how about the rest of the bathroom (chipped tiles or a bargain suite won’t cut it next to all those shimmering crystals).

Why not set your glittering bathtub off with a golden plated sink with crystals on the taps, or, better yet, a Swarovski studded toilet.

The 'Isis' collection by designer Jemal Wright of Hollywood
 features blinged-out bathroom fixtures including a glittering loo which will set you back $75,000 (about £49,800).

And for the discerning toddler, there is the My Carry Potty -
 a £700 Swarovski crystal-studded toilet created by Amanda Jenner, which
 allows little ones to 'go' in - or on - luxury wherever the need 
strikes.

Why not keep the glitter theme going with a bejeweled toilet for both you (left, by Jemal Wright) and your toddler (right, by Amanda Jenner), which together will set you back about £50,500
