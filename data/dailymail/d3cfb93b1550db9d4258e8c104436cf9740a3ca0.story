Cleveland Browns wide 
receiver Josh Gordon was arrested and charged with driving while 
intoxicated after speeding down a street in Raleigh on Saturday, 
bringing the troubled Pro Bowler's already cloudy future into more 
doubt.

The arrest was revealed shortly after Gordon posted a run of pics of wild partying in Florida to his Instagram, including a shot of the NFL star in the airport with a caption saying he 'had to get outta Miami.'

Gordon was taken into custody after 
being pulled over for going 50 mph in a 35 mph zone on U.S. 70 in 
northwest Raleigh around 3 a.m. Saturday, police spokesman Jim Sughrue 
said.

Gordon was released on a $500 court bond, paid for by Haydn 'Fats' Thomas (not pictured) a convicted felon who was given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to gun and drug charges in November

The police report on Gordon's arrest 
wasn't finished, so Sughrue didn't know what type of vehicle Gordon was 
driving or what led the officer to suspect he had been drinking.

ESPN reports that upon being asked if the DWI charge was for alcohol or a separate drug Sughrue said he could not comment on either the tests given to Gordon or the results.

WNCN reports that his blood-alcohol level was .09 - above the North Carolina legal limit of .08 - and that he admitted to having three drinks with vodka.

Court records did not list an attorney.

The
 23-year-old wide receiver has been in trouble before off the field. He 
was suspended two games last season for violating the NFL's 
substance-abuse policy, but still led the league with 1,646 yards 
receiving .

Gordon reportedly failed another 
drug test during the offseason, which could lead to a season-long ban.

In May, he was ticketed for speeding and a passenger in his car was 
cited for marijuana possession. He pleaded not guilty and has a hearing 
in the case scheduled for next Friday.

Gordon was at team's recent 
mini-camp, but has declined interviews.

Browns
 management has been waiting to hear from the NFL before deciding 
Gordon's future. Cleveland General Manager Ray Farmer found out about 
the arrest hours after it happened.

"We are 
aware of the matter and are disappointed to learn of this situation. We 
will comment further at the appropriate time," Farmer said in a 
statement.

Gordon's agent Drew Rosenhaus said he had no comment about the arrest.

Gordon is known to have failed at least three drug tests in 
college, but the Browns were willing to overlook his past when they 
selected him in the second round of the supplemental draft in 2012.

Former
 teammate and captain, linebacker D'Qwell Jackson said on Twitter: 'If 
you're close to Josh Gordon please help this kid, it's not about 
football anymore it's about picking up the pieces of his life.'
