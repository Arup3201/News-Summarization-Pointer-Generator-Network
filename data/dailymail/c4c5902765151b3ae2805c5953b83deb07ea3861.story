The head of the RAF has warned that Typhoon jets could crash into airliner planes resulting in a massive loss of life because the fighter jet has not been fitted with a collision avoidance system.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford told Defence Secretary Michael Fallon about the dangers of the £126m Eurofighter Typhoon, which is not fitted with an airborne collision warning system, an official report has revealed.

The annual report revealed the UK's military aviation watchdog has said a collision avoidance system must be fitted to the RAF's fleet of Typhoons 'with full haste'.

The annual report from the Military Aviation Authority also warned that a collision between a Typhoon and a commercial jet, however improbable, would be 'catastrophic'.

The MAA's advice follows a critical report issued last year into a mid-air collision between two RAF Tornados.

The Ministry of Defence said programmes had started for the fitting of systems.

The MAA said that the failure to fit a collision avoidance system to Typhoon jets aircraft was 'unsustainable' and must be pursued 'with full haste'.

In his annual report into air safety, the director general of the MAA, Air Marshal Richard Garwood, said anti-collision software should also be fitted to the new F35 fighter.

AM Garwood said there were 'well documented failings over the fitment of an airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS) to Tornado GR4'.

He added: 'In the worst case, which is judged improbable but catastrophic, a Typhoon colliding with commercial air traffic could result in severe consequences for the MoD because of the likely substantial third party loss of life.'

Such a crash, he warned, could result in more than 50 deaths, and 'would have adverse repercussions for the institution responsible, in this case the government of the day'.

The report says the majority of mid-air collisions involving UK Military aircraft have taken place below 3,000ft, and with RAF aircraft now spending more time at a medium level than they did previously, there is an increasing likelihood of a fast-jet conflict with commercial air traffic.

The report goes on to state that in the annual UK AirProx Board report in 2013, it detailed 14 incidents ranging from four Class B (safety not assured) to one Class A risk of collision. 

AM Garwood said: 'The provision of an ACAS to Typhoon is an important issue for Defence.

'Ultimately, the Typhoon will be in service for many years, and if the MoD elects not to fit an ACAS, the decision will need to be well documented and the risk held at the highest levels of defence.'

An MoD spokesman said: 'The department has welcomed the MAA's report, and is acting upon its comments and recommendations.

'Air safety is at the core of all our aviation activity and we take very seriously our obligations to our people and the wider community to ensure that our activities are both as safe as reasonably practicable and comply with relevant policy and legislation.'

The MoD said a collision avoidance system was being fitted to the Tornado GR4, the type of aircraft involved in the crash over the Moray Firth in 2012.

Three crewmen died in the incident off the Caithness coast in aircraft flown out of RAF Lossiemouth in Moray.

Work was also underway to have a system developed for Typhoons, the MoD said.

It added that 'further technologies' and 'planned upgrades' were proposed for the new F35 fighter. 

In October it was revealed that plans to fit Moray-based RAF Tornado jets with a potentially life-saving crash warning system had been hit by fresh delays.

Defence chiefs had promised that the anti-collision system would be installed in the aircraft by the end of last year, having been first identified in 1990 but plans have repeatedly been shelved.

The pledge was reiterated in July, after a scathing report into the 2012 crash involving two RAF Lossiemouth Tornado GR4s over the Moray Firth found the failure to fit the technology contributed to the deaths of three crew.

But trials of the new equipment found a 'number of issues' that will lead to 'revised timescales'. 

Angus Robertson, the Moray MP and SNP defence spokesman, discovered the latest delay after tabling questions in Westminster.

The questions have also revealed that the MoD has already spent £49.7million developing the system.

In response to a query about the equipment, Defence Minister Philip Dunne said in October: 'Flight trials of the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II in two Tornado aircraft during 2014 have revealed a number of issues that require resolution before the system can be rolled-out across the fleet.

'It is not possible to give an indication of revised timescales until the scope of the additional work has been properly assessed.'

Tornado jets are currently involved in UK military action against the Isis terror group in Iraq.

Mr Robertson said last year: 'This further delay is the latest broken promise in a long running and scandalous situation.

'It is utterly unacceptable that the timetable for installing a collision warning system has slipped further.

'The publication this summer of the Military Aviation Authority report into the tragic fatal collision over the Moray Firth highlighted a chain of bad decisions based on cost-benefit-analysis which is completely wrong when we are talking about service personnel's lives.

'Now that the MoD has extended the life of the Tornado's after their botched Defence Review it is even more imperative that these systems which were recommended over 15 years ago are finally installed.'

An MoD source told added: ‘Avoidance of collision in the air cannot be purely reliant on equipment of any sort as it is not effective against all types of aircraft.

'This is why a multi-layered approach is more effective incorporating de-confliction planning, extensive flying supervision, sound airmanship, equipment fitted to aircraft to aid situational awareness, employment of suitable radar services and ultimately an effective lookout from the aircrew to “see and avoid” each other.’ 

The MAA's inquiry into the 2012 crash found 17 factors contributed to the deaths of Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders, Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey and Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole.

It recently emerged an RAF Typhoon fighter and a light aircraft came dangerously close to colliding over East Anglia because of an air traffic control blunder.

The jet was taking part in a training exercise when the pilot spotted a Cesna in its path at around 2,600ft.

It dived and shot underneath the smaller plane within around 200ft of it.

A report said the pilot of the single-engine Cessna did not see the Typhoon before it passed beneath him.

The UK Airprox Board, which examines near-misses, classified the degree of risk of a collision as A, or high.

They said safety margins were reduced 'to the minimum' in the scare over Fakenham, Norfolk on the morning of July 31.

The board blamed an air traffic controller at RAF Marham for allowing the Typhoon to fly 'into conflict' with the C172 Cessna.

They said the pilot of the private plane had correctly informed the base of his plans to fly.

He telephoned the control tower at Marham before taking off from a nearby airstrip and was told Tornados would be operating from the base but was not given any specifics.

The Marham air traffic controller said he was controlling three different types of aircraft at the time the near-miss occurred.

He did not see the Cessna on his radar until he received a warning that another plane was in front of the Typhoon.

He said when he radioed to warn its pilot, he was told the jet had just passed beneath the Cessna.

HQ Air Command said: 'The Typhoon pilot was in a reasonably busy phase of flight, descending and configuring his aircraft for an approach, so his lookout would have been compromised.'

The report concluded: 'The Board felt that the C172 pilot had done his best to inform Marham of his intentions to fly close to their radar pattern, had called them on the radio, and had attempted to route away from their normal radar pattern.

'The Board discussed at length the cause of the Airprox and eventually agreed that Marham ATC had allowed the Typhoon pilot to fly into conflict with the C172.'

It added: 'The incident had just stopped short of an actual collision where safety margins had been reduced to the minimum.'
