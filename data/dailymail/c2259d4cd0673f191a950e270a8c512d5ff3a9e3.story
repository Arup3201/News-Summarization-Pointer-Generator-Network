Hard-liner: Martine Aubry, 60, who opened the Sangatte refugee camp is set to be named the new French Prime Minister

France's leading female socialist who wants to make it easier for refugees to get into Britain is the frontrunner to become the country's next prime minister.

Martine Aubry - also the woman who opened the controversial Sangatte hostel 12 years ago - is expected to be handed France's top government post by new president Francois Hollande within days.

The hard-line left-winger is the daughter of notorious former EU Commission chief Jacques Delors.

She who pushed to introduce France's compulsory 35-hour working week which was relaxed under Nicolas Sarkozy's right-wing UMP party.

Aubry, 60, caused anger in Britain two years ago when she said that if the socialists took power in 2012, they would scrap a French law which makes it a crime to offer 'food, shelter and assistance' to illegal immigrants.

Ditching the rules would make it 
easier for the estimated 1,000 refugees massed in Calais to remain there
- and create an incentive for many more to arrive.

The law is used by police in Calais to prosecute people who house or feed British-bound refugees living rough in the northern French port.

Those convicted face up to five years in prison and a Â£25,000 fine.

The law was thrust into the media spotlight two years ago by a film called Welcome, about a Calais swimming instructor who was prosecuted for teaching a refugee to swim across the Channel to Britain.

The film's director Phipppe Loiret likened the law to 'having a Jew hidden in your cellar' during Nazi Germany.

But Aubry, also the mayor of the 
northern socialist stronghold of Lille, said in 2010: 'This law punishes
kindness and makes people live in fear.

'We
have drafted legislation aimed at removing the rules so people can 
offer basic free aid to illegal immigrants whose lives could be in 
danger without it.

'This law will be overturned when our party takes power.'

Aubry
has also always strongly defended the controversial decision she made 
as social affairs minister in 1997 to open the Sangatte refugee camp.

The camp acted as a stepping stone for 60,000 migrants to flood into Britain before it was bulldozed in 2002.

Aubry said last year: 'I opened Sangatte as a humanitarian gesture because people were suffering, and it is a decision I stand by without regret.'

Incoming President Hollande is expected to name his new cabinet later this week, with long-term ally Ms Aubry known to be one of the staunchest supporters of his anti-austerity programme of higher spending and tax hikes for the rich.
