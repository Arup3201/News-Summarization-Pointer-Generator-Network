Her agent Phil Belfield said today: 'She 
was extraordinary, she had so much energy and vitality with a love for

She made her debut on stage in a production of The Merchant of Venice in 1963. She then went on to appear in The Saint and The Avengers - among many other shows.

In the 70s, she appeared in The Brothers - a BBC drama - alongside Tom Baker.

She appeared in Triangle in the early 80s and, in one particularly memorable scene she sunbathed topless on a North Sea ferry.

It was her recurring role of Caress Morrell in Dynasty from 1986 onwards that saw the actress achieve international recognition.

She also appeared in the original run of 
Doctor Who opposite both Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy as renegade 
Time Lord The Rani.

The Rani first appeared 1985 - and returned twice more in the cult television series.

In October 2013, the 50th anniversary of the show, Kate spoke to Digital Spy about returning to Doctor Who.

She said: 'I'll still be wearing the tight leather trousers and high-heel boots, regardless of what age!

'I have white hair now, but a lot of it, and I'm still very glamorous, so I won't disappoint!'

She also told the Huffington Post: 'I'd love to come back as The Rani another time around.

'To have a much older woman as your adversary, there's something interesting about that.'

In the late 80s, Kate starred as a ruthless businesswoman in BBC drama Howards' Way, which was dubbed the 'Dallas of the Seas'.

In the 1990s she starred in the comedy show Absolutely Fabulous as Jackie, the sister of Joanna Lumley's character Patsy.

More recently she had appeared in ITV soap Benidorm and a 2012 stage adaptation of Agatha Christie's Death On The Nile.

Kate had been married and divorced three times and had one son.

Tragically in January 2013, Dickon O'Mara was found dead in a garage at his mother's home.

It is thought he had been dead for up to three weeks when his body was discovered.

An inquest in to his death heard how he had spiralled into a life of drink and drug abuse after suffering brain damage when he was run over three years earlier.

The theatre technician had been hit by a car in January 2010 and suffered brain injuries which affected his balance and left him unable to work.

The inquest heard he appeared to have been sleeping in the garage of his mother’s home after she asked him to leave her cottage two months earlier because she could no longer cope with his behaviour.

By then, the actress had been hospitalised with pneumonia. She was still too ill to attend the inquest.

Kate is survived by her sister, the actress Belinda Carroll.

Mr Belfield said there would be a private funeral and a memorial service on a date to be confirmed.
