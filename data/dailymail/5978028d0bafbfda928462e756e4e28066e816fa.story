A masked robber, who sexually assaulted a woman in her bed after climbing through an open window, was caught when police traced him using an app on her stolen phone.

Police arrested Raymond Yates, 31, within an hour of the break-in using a tracking app on one of two mobile phones he stole and he was today convicted of robbery and sexual assault.  

He had been filmed casing
 the property on a CCTV camera at the front door before he tied a T-shirt over his face and opened her window.

Raymond Yates was filmed on a CCTV camera casing the property before climbing in through an open window and sexually assaulting a woman in her bed

Shameless: After checking the window was open, he took off his shoes and tied a T-shirt over his face to try and conceal his identity

The woman, who was sleeping alone in the 
room, woke to find him straddling her and pinning her to the bed. He then threatened to kill her if she screamed for help.

Yates, of no fixed address, was also convicted of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence following a trial at Woolwich Crown Court today.

Yates was captured on the static CCTV camera wrapping a T-shirt around his face to try to conceal his identity before casually climbing through the window of the property in Forest Hill, south east London, at about 5am on July 25.

Moments earlier he had been seen casing the property and putting his head through the window.

He also had no shoes on to lessen the chances of him being heard as he approached.

Yates then sexually assaulted the woman and threatened to kill her if she made a sound.

He was today convicted of robbery and sexual assault after being traced by police using a security app on one of the victim's phones that he stole

He fled through the same window having stolen two mobile phones at about 5am. The attack lasted about a minute.

He was arrested on board a bus in Brixton Hill just an hour after the incident, after police traced him using the security app. He still had the phones still on him.

Detectives said the amount of planning Yates had put into the crime showed he was a 'committed criminal'

Detective Constable Corrado Di Mascio of the Metropolitan Police's Sapphire Unit, part of the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a particularly harrowing attack on a lone woman whilst she slept in her bed at home.

'The evidence shows that Yates was 
calculating in his attack, concealing his identity and taking off his 
shoes in an attempt to mask his approach.

'I would like to praise the victim who has been committed to seeing her attacker brought to justice.'

Detective
 Chief Inspector Pete Thomas, also of Sapphire, added: 'The level of 
planning and thought Yates demonstrated while carrying out this offence 
shows he is a committed offender.

'While
 we have no concrete evidence of other offences we cannot discount the 
possibility that Yates may have carried out other attacks.

'If
 you believe you have been the victim of this man, please contact 
police. Sapphire have specially trained officers who will support you 
and strive to obtain justice for you.'

Yates will be sentenced at a later date.
