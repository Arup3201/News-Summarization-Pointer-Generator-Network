A bride-to-be discovered she had a deadly brain tumour after her leg began jolting uncontrollably while she was vaccuming.

Claire Dent, 43,  experienced a phenomenon known as myoclonic jerks - similar to the 'jumping limb' sensation people experience when drifting off to sleep.

Mrs Dent, a part-time children’s centre assistant, said: 'For some reason, using the upright vacuum cleaner caused my right leg to start dancing about. I couldn’t even run the vacuum in a straight line. It was like my leg was doing Riverdance.

Claire Dent, with husband Jez,  experienced a phenomenon known as myoclonic jerks while vaccuming - which led to the discovery of a brain tumour

Mrs Dent, on her wedding day with daughet Eve, described the jolting as similar to the 'jumping limb' sensation people experience when drifting off to sleep

'It was frightening, but I hoped it was just a trapped nerve or sciatica, or the side-effect of sinusitis I was suffering with.

'The following day, as I was pegging out some washing, the sensation returned and I felt numbness spreading across my right side.'

Mrs Dent, who has an 11-year-old daughter named Eve, was driven to A&E where she underwent a brain scan and doctors discovered a tumour the size of a golf ball.

She was told she would need an operation to remove the tumour - a grade one frontal lobemeningioma - which was threatening to press down on her brain.

If left alone to develop, the non-cancerous growth would kill her.

Doctors told Mrs Dent the myoclonic jerks were because of the brain tumour - perhaps due to the tumour pressing on certain areas of the brain.

The shock diagnosis prompted her to bring forward her marriage to her fiance Jez, 45, a self-employed labourer.

She said: 'My dad was with me when they told me. He is a tough man’s man, but he broke down when we got the news. The words "brain tumour" sound so scary.

'I put on a tough face but my first thought was for my daughter Eve. I wanted her future to be secure.

'Me and Jez loved each other deeply, and suddenly we had a reason to get on with things and get married.

'Brain surgery always carries a risk and I wondered whether I would still be the same person after the operation. So it was important to me to get married sooner rather than later.'

A church wedding was organised within five weeks, after which Mrs Dent, of Wakefield, began the painful process of writing farewell letters to her family and friends.

She said: 'The wedding was perfect. I’d always wanted to get married in a church so be able to be there with everyone was wonderful.

'It was difficult writing the letters to Eve and Jez. In her letter, I told Eve that I loved her.

'I told her to brave and not let anyone tell her she couldn’t follow her dreams.'

Finally, in November 2010, three months after her diagnosis, Mrs Dent underwent neurosurgery at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield to remove the tumour.

She said: 'To hear the surgeon say afterwards that he had removed all the tumour was an enormous relief. I could start thinking about the future again.'

Mrs Dent required a further round of emergency surgery a year later when the incision on the top of her head reopened, leaving her brain exposed.

Following her diagnosis, Mrs Dent suffers from anxiety and has developed a phobia of housework after it led to her illness being diagnosed

Today, she suffers with anxiety and has developed a phobia of housework because of its association with the episode which led to the tumour diagnosis.

She said: 'I tried replacing the upright hoover with a different type to see if that made any difference, but I’m still a nervous wreck around it.

'I couldn’t bare the thought of vacuuming the stairs in case I lost strength in my legs again.

'Jez is happy to accept that doing the vacuuming is his job now.'

Mrs Dent has found a network of other brain tumour patients at www.braintumourdiaries.co.uk and is currently raising money for Ellie’s Fund Brain Tumour Trust, a registered charity raising money to support children with brain tumours and their families.
