'Our prayers and thoughts go to Dan,' Cardinals coach Bruce Arians told ESPN.

Defensive lineman Darnell Dockett said he was thinking about his teammate during the game.

'We
miss him, but family is more important than the National Football 
League on any level, and he needs to take as much time as he can with 
his family,' Dockett said.

'We're
going to be OK and welcome him back and embrace him, but at this point 
in time he can take as much time as he can with his family.'
