The Justice Department wants to seize money paid to convicted fraudster Jordan Belfort, the real-life Wolf of Wall Street, for the rights to his story.

The former stockbroker was ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to his victims as part of his sentencing in 2003, but so far, he has paid just $11.6 million - and most of that came from sales of his property.

Red Granite Productions paid Belfort, 51, $1.045 million for the rights to his story in 2011. But according to government documents, Belfort paid just $21,000 in restitution that year.

Belfort served 22 months of a four-year prison sentence for securities violations. Upon his release, he was ordered to pay 50 per cent of his gross income in restitution.

According to Belfort himself, he hasn't profited from his story.

'I am not making any royalties off the film or the books, and I am totally content with that. My income comes from new life, which is far better than my old one,' Belfort wrote on his Facebook page on December 29.

'For the record, I am not turning over 50% of the profits of the books and the movie, which was what the government had wanted me to do. Instead, I insisted on turning over 100% of the profits of both books and the movie, which is to say, I am not making a single dime on any of this. This should amount to countless millions of dollars and hopefully be more than enough to pay back anyone who is still out there,' he added.

Prosecutors say Belfort is living off book royalties, the money from the film rights and fees from his burgeoning career as a motivational speaker.

In addition, say prosecutors, Belfort has skipped the country to Australia, complicating the government's efforts to track his income.

'We want to set the record straight,' Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn told the Wall Street Journal. 'Belfort's making these claims, and they're not factual. He's in Australia and using that loophole to avoid paying.'

'The government has seen nothing to suggest that even 100 per cent of Belfort's profits from his book and the movie Wolf of Wall Street would yield, in his words, "countless millions," much less the approximately $100 million that is still owed to the victims,' he said.

Belfort's lawyer denies that charge, saying his client traveled to Australia for work reasons but lives in Manhattan Beach, California.

Belfort's Facebook page tells a different story: photographs appear on his page dated from April 10 2013 through May and June. He then appears to head to London and Los Angeles before arriving back in Australia in November, where he's apparently spent most of his time up until now.

His most recent posts all come from Melbourne, Australia.

The U.S. government contends that 
Belfort must continue to pay 50 per cent of his income in restitution, 
but Belfort's lawyer says he is no longer obligated to comply with 
the court-ordered payment plan because his supervised release period is 
now over.

Belfort's lawyer, Nicholas De Feis, told the Wall Street Journal that his client has paid every restitution payment he owes.

Belfort, who is the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, in which he is played by Leonard Dicaprio, is now being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his infamous party lifestyle in the 1990s

'He's made payments as he was required to make payments and as he earned income,' said De Feis. 'He has never run from his obligations.'

Prosecutors went public with their frustrations this week after Belfort's claims on Facebook. They have asked the court to hold him in default.

The Hollywood Reporter reveals that Belfort has also been shopping around a reality television series - which could cause further financial disputes if picked up.

The Wolf of Wall Street documents Belfort's time at the Stratton Oakmont brokerage house in the 1990s. He was eventually convicted of money laundering and securities fraud.

Last night, Leonardo DiCaprio won a Best Actor Golden Globe award for his portrayal of Belfort at the height of his Wall Street career.
