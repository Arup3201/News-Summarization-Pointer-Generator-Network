In his Cabinet days, he was a rather substantial figure.

But as this picture shows, Lord Falconer is now just two-thirds of the man he used to be – after shedding five stone.

His secret? An unconventional diet of apples and Diet Coke.

Big changes: Lord Falconer has dropped five stone in the past two years after giving up lunch and alcohol

The former Lord Chancellor has revealed he adopted the bizarre regime after looking at the scales and deciding he was ‘about to fall off a cliff’.

He told yesterday how he now skips breakfast and lunch, runs five miles in 45 minutes almost every day, and has given up alcohol.

To keep him going, he snacks on apples and downs as many as nine cans of Diet Coke – and allows himself one normal meal in the evening.

In just two years, he has gone from 16st 6lb to 11st 5lb – a transformation that has left many of his former colleagues speculating about whether ‘Champagne Charlie’ is ill.

The 62-year-old, who left the Cabinet seven years ago, said: ‘I found that for me abstinence was much easier to deal with than eating a little. It’s much easier to look forward to my meal in the evening.

‘It appears to have no adverse effect on me. In my old regime I was much more likely to feel drowsy in the afternoon.’ 

When he was in the Cabinet, Charles Falconer was most at home with a glass of red wine and a plate of red meat.

These days it’s a very different story. ‘I had my last drink on December 30. I don’t have a particular date when I’ll start drinking again,’ he said.

‘I’ve also stopped drinking coffee and tea. The big downside consequence is that I have become addicted to Diet Coke. I might drink eight or nine of them a day. I was pleased to see that the EU, after much deliberation, has decided that they don’t cause cancer.’

He said he took inspiration from Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor who shed five stone and then wrote a diet book about his methods.

Lord Falconer, who once shared a flat with Tony Blair, first adopted the 5:2 diet, which George Osborne has used to get into shape, but later decided a stricter regime was necessary.

But the speed of Falconer’s weight loss worried many colleagues, with some convinced he was supporting assisted dying because he was terminally ill himself.

For the past few years he has been trying to push through a change in the law to make it easier for terminally ill people to end their lives.

He admitted that it had been difficult to lose weight while working in the Cabinet. ‘I was just so fat … I just thought: you’re about to fall over a cliff. There will be no going back. You’ll be fat for ever,’ he said.

‘I felt between 1997 and 2007 that I was the only new Labour minister who would drink at lunchtime.’

He added: ‘A lot of people ask if it has changed my personality. I don’t think it has at all.’

Grossly overweight, Lord Falconer was heading down the path to diabetes, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke.

So it is absolutely right that he lost all that weight, and that would have been true regardless of the technique that he used.

It’s great that he has given up alcohol, and it will be very beneficial to his long-term health.

However, dieticians wouldn’t recommend following his eating plan. Because he is missing breakfast, there is nothing to fuel him all day. The old saying that you should breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper is still sensible.

His consumption of Diet Coke may be considered excessive. There is no solid evidence that this is harmful, although one side-effect of caffeine can be irritability.

And the regime must take iron will, so there is a danger he might fall off it after a while. In order to turn this diet into a life-long commitment, he should approach a professional dietician to tweak the nutrients he is taking in. Since dinner is his only meal, he needs to ensure he is including all the right vitamins and minerals. He needs to include lots of greens as well as oily fish like mackerel.

He should also try to retrain his palate, because he obviously has a sweet tooth. Swapping Diet Coke for other drinks may help him to overcome this in the long-term.
