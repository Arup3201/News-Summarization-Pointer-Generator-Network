Suspended: Kim Warren, 44, is the principal of Deerfield Elementary School in Novi, Michigan

A 44-year-old elementary school principal has been suspended from work and charged with being 'super drunk' after she was arrested sitting in her car on school property.

The mother-of three, Kim Warren, was found to be twice over the limit with an open bottle of vodka in her car in Michigan.

Details of her arrest were revealed when she appeared in court yesterday for the first time and police released a video of her slipping out of her handcuffs after being arrested on April 8.

Warren was arrested and handcuffed after she was spotted driving her car erratically near her school, Deerfield Elementary School in Novi, Michigan.

After failing a roadside sobriety test she was placed in the back of police patrol car with her hands cuffed.

But a camera in the car captured Warren slipping out of the handcuffs and offering them up to the officer sitting in the front.

He calmly tells her not to throw them out of the window.

Novi Police Chief David Molloy admitted the handcuffs had not been applied correctly.

He said: 'Ensuring the appropriate tightness and tension when applying handcuffs to a prisoner is very important.

'In this case, as in several others we encounter, arrested subjects do maneuver their way out of the handcuffs. It's critical the officer properly checks the handcuffs to ensure something like this doesn't happen.'

Warren was arrested after two breath tests showed her to be more than twice over the legal limit.

Two passers by had called police to report a car driving erratically and then pulling into the school parking lot.

One of the callers told the dispatcher it was 'scary' seeing what appeared to be a drunk driver swerving all over the road.

When an officer spoke with Warren he noticed an open vodka bottle by her feet.

Warren was suspended from her school after the arrest on April 8th.

She made her first court appearance on Monday where she was arraigned  charges of High Blood Alcohol Content which is known as being 'super drunk'.

She was also charged with having open Intoxicants in a Motor Vehicle.

Warren has not made any comment on her arrest and suspension.

But the school's superintendent Maurielle Lue said: 'She's deeply regretful for what's happened.  She understands that it was a horrible decision.  She will not be back in that school for a long time, if ever.

'I felt horrible for Miss Warren.  It has to be a terrible thing to go through.  I was angry at her for putting herself in this situation, but also the district and that school in this situation.'
