D-Day veterans have protested after a new French Second World War tourism campaign ignored one of the Normandy beaches where British troops went ashore.

Six tourist boards along the Normandy 
coast launched the new D-Day initiative to promote what it calls the 'Secteur 
mythique' - or mythical sector where action took place.

It stretches from Utah and Omaha in the west to Gold and Juno beaches where Allied troops from the U.S., UK and Canada went ashore.

Never forget: Normandy Veteran Eric Buckley, then 85, from Leicester places a wooden remembrance plaque on what was the British Sword beach at Colleville Montgomery on June 5, 2009 near Caen, France

But the campaign stops short of Sword Beach in the east, where 700 British soldiers were killed or wounded on June 6, 1944.

Sword Beach was the code name given by 
Second World War Allied commanders to one of the five main landing areas
along the Normandy coast during the D-Day landings, or Operation 
Overlord as it is sometimes known.

It stretches roughly five miles
from Ouistreham to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer. It was the eastern-most beach of 
the Normandy landings.

The Allied forces most heavily involved 
in the assault on Sword Beach were the British 3rd Infantry Division. 
Various brigades were attached to the main assault group.

Significant, 
and emblematic from a French standpoint, was the inclusion of the 1st 
Special Service Brigade within which was comprised the Free French 
Commandos.

From the Allies' point of view, it was 
important and highly symbolic that French forces should be included as 
part of the D-Day invasion, contributing to the liberation of their own 
country.

After the initial landings on Sword Beach, British troops moved off the beach and pushed inland towards Caen. Sword was the most easterly of the landing beaches. British troops also landed at beaches codenamed Juno and Gold near Arromanches and Courseulles

A massive flotilla of boats was organised to carry troops across the Channel to Normandy on June 6, 1944

Omaha Beach secured after D-Day, 1944. The beach where U.S. troops landed is part of the so-called 'Secteur mythique'

The website Dday-overlord.com is running a campaign for the French tourist boards to include Sword Beach in their promotion

One of those veterans who went ashore, Royal Artillery signaller Albert Owens, now 88, told of his dismay at the decision.

He said: 'A lot lost their lives in that area. It seems to be an insult to their memory to leave them out. If you are going to promote some of the beaches, you should promote them all.'

The tourist board decision has also been criticised by the local regional council of Basse-Normandie as well as the French Normandie-Mémoire and D-Day Committee associations.

It was a rousing battle cry for British troops about to risk their lives on D-Day.

Written
by their commander in chief General Sir Bernard Montgomery, the 
stirring words were delivered to tens of thousands of men on the eve of 
the Normandy landings in 1944.

'Good luck to each one of you,' he declared. 'And good hunting on the main land of Europe.'

General Montgomery instructed unit 
commanders to read the words 'to all troops' to inspire them as they 
prepared to take on Hitler's military might.

On 
June 6 some 135,000 Allied soldiers landed on five beaches – codenamed 
Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah.

By the end of the ferocious fighting 
on what was immortalised in film as the Longest Day, around 4,000 Allied
troops had been killed – but the invaders had secured a foothold in 
Nazi Europe.

The rousing speech ends with the poignant line 'Good luck to each one of you. And good hunting on the main land of Europe'.

Montgomery also quotes the famous lines of Scottish nobleman and Civil War soldier James Graham:

He either fears his fate too much,Or his deserts are small,That dares not put it to the touch,To gain or lose it all.

The latter two D-Day organisations already support tourism and commemorations for all municipalities right along all sectors of the D-Day Normandy beaches, recognising the contribution and sacrifice of troops of all nationalities.

They have been remembering D-Day for almost 70 years, 2014 marking the 70th anniversary of the Normandy Landings.

Towns associated with Sword Beach have also expressed their strong dissatisfaction with the tourist boards' decision which they say has everything to do with tourism and nothing to do with history.

A spokesman for The Battle of Normandy website, DDay-Overlord.com, Marc Laurenceau, slammed the decision, saying: 'With such an initiative, six tourist offices ... develop history tourism without worrying about history.

'What they consider is money. The American sector and the town of Arromanches (included in this so-called 'mythical sector') attract more than 85 per cent of the Battle of Normandy tourists.

'Instead of making an effort on Sword Beach and the Commonwealth drop zones, these six tourist offices just care about the most popular areas.

'What will British and French veterans who landed at La Brèche-d'Hermanville on D-Day think? What will be the thoughts of those who were parachuted northeast of Ranville?

'What about their fallen comrades, killed to free a piece of land that is not considered "mythical" enough according to these six tourist offices?'

Mr Laurenceau has demanded an urgent re-think by the six Normandy tourist boards involved, calling upon them to cancel the 'Mythical Sector' project as it's presently configured.

A petition has also been launched by DDay-Overlord.com calling for the abandonment of what they see as a tourist project disrespectful to the fallen heroes of Sword Beach.

This year's general assembly of the 
landings organising committee - the Comité du Débarquement - confirmed 
the 69th annual D-Day commemoration events will centre on 
Vierville-sur-Mer, honouring U.S troops who took part in the D-Day 
landings on the adjacent Omaha beach.
