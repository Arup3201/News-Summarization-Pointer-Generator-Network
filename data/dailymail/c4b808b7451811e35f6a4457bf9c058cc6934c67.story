West Midlands Police have received 71 reports of witches ghosts and zombies over a three year period - however the Black Country is officially werewolf-free. 

Between 2011 and 2013, the force was obliged to investigate reports of paranormal activity in what has now been dubbed The Black Country Triangle. 

According to Nick Duffy of the West Midlands' Ghost Club, much of this upsurge is probably due to poor quality American television shows dealing with the paranormal. 

According to police figures, between 2011 and 2013 there have been 15 ghosts, 55 witches, and two zombies reported to officers in the West Midlands, however, the Black Country is officially free of werewolves 

The Black Country Triangle: West Midlands Police have received 71 ghoulish reports between 2011-2013

Nick Duffy of the West Midlands Ghost Club, pictured, said much of the increase could be down to impressionable people watching television shows such as Charmed featuring witches and the paranormal

According to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act, West Midlands Police have received 15 reports of ghosts, 55 incidents of witchcraft and a pair of zombies roaming the area over a three year period. 

The paranormal researcher asked for the number of reports of ghosts, werewolves, witches and zombies over the past three calendar years received by West Midlands Police.

The unnamed person wanted to know especially 'any other details included in the calls? ie seven werewolves attacking people' and what action was taken by police.  

According to the FOI document: 'The reports include ghost, zombie and witch sightings, hearing and communicating with the aforementioned, the use of witchcraft, claims to be a witch and witch hunters. I have not included terms such as "she called me a witch", "he was in a zombie-like state".'  

However, according to the figures, 2013 featured record complaints of incidents involving ghosts and witches and worryingly the first two reports of zombies in the region. No reports of werewolves activity were made by the region's 2.8 million population. 

The paranormal reports were spread across Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Solihull, Sadwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton.

Mr Duffy said: 'I am very surprised by the number of reports of witchcraft. I guess that is down to the popularity of TV shows such as Charmed. 

'We set up the West Midlands Ghost Club in 1989 and we have received thousands of reports of paranormal activity. It is fair to say that there is a Black Country Triangle. 

'We investigate each case on its own individual merits. It may seem surprising but we do not go to a house to either prove or disprove the presence of a ghost or spirit. There are charlatans out there who arrive with psychics who claim they can talk to the spirits or the little boy who had been murdered in the corner, but that is utter bunkum. 

'Our job is simply to reassure people who are facing a problem. In may cases, it doesn't really matter if a house is haunted or not, if the person is convinced and they are in danger, then they will want to move.'

Mr Duffy said he received one report of a werewolf in Solihull. 

He added: 'She was convinced a werewolf was feeding in her bins but it turned out to be a dog. We have had other cases of people convinced they could hear voices and they've turned out to be the neighbours.'  

Force spokesman, Billy Corrigan, said: 'Our officers routinely see the consequences of spirits when things go bump... but that tends to be of a night when the pubs have closed their doors and we’re making sure people get home safely.

'While the figures can seem amusing, behind some of these "supernatural" calls may be a deeply troubled individual or a person wasting valuable police time which would be better spent preventing real crimes.

'West Midlands Police always take action against those found to be knowingly making false and malicious calls to the emergency services.' 

In May, mother-of-three Michele Bardsley, 35 claimed she filmed UFOs above her home in Solihull, West Midlands. 

The video she made shows a formation of three or four lights, rising and falling together in the night sky.

She claimed she filmed the phenomenon for at least 40 minutes - only breaking off for to put on her slippers when her feet got cold.

Ms Bardlesy said she spent 40 minutes filming the unidentified flying object outside her home in Solihull 

She said: 'I was painting upstairs then went to the back door for a cig. I looked up and there were these shapes, like red orbs, in the sky.

'They didn't look like stars or planes or helicopters, they were just hanging there. I thought I'd had a few too many rum and cokes.

'I got my phone and zoomed in on them. I was there for about 20 minutes, my feet were freezing but I couldn't come away.

'Eventually I had to come back inside for my slippers and fags, then I went back out and filmed another 20 minutes.

'I must have looked mad out there for so long just filming the sky but it was so strange I did not want to go inside.'
