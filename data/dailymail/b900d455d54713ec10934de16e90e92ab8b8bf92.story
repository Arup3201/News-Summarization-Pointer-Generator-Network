A Missouri family say a police officer shot dead their friendly golden retriever named Marley for no apparent reason in front of their horrified children just days before Christmas.

Rhiannon Wilhite, of Camden, says the officer in question fired twice on the dog, took a long pause and then squeezed off another round in the family’s backyard last week.

'I watched my family member get murdered,' the woman tearfully recounted to Fox4.

According to the Camden resident, her three-and-a-half-year-old pooch was in the habit of meeting his young owners at the bus station on their way home from school.

On December 17, Marley was seen barking at a little girl near the bus stop and following her down the street.

Later that day, an officer claiming to be from the Camden Police Department pulled into the Wilhites' driveway in a Ray County Sheriff's patrol car.

The law enforcement official informed Mrs Wilhite that her dog needed to be on a leash at the bus station.

The woman says she was in the process of pulling Marley into the house when the pup took off running.

Executed: Marley's owners say the officer shot the dog twice, then took a 30-second pause and squeezed off another round. Afterwards, he told them he was afraid the pooch was going to bite him

As the pet was approaching the house from the other side, the officer pulled out his service weapon and shot Marley twice in quick succession, and then a third time after about 30 seconds, leaving his lifeless body in the yard, said the owner. 

Raymond Wilhite, Rhiannon’s husband, says the officer told him he shot Marley because he was afraid the dog was going to attack him. The family insist the golden retriever had no history of aggression towards humans.

Mr Wilhire tearfully described how he borrowed a shovel from his father and buried Marley in their yard after allowing his devastated children to say goodbye to their beloved dog.

The officer showed up at the Wilhites' home after the dog was allegedly spotted barking at a little girl and following her without a leash 

Rhiannon Wilhite, an emergency room technician, says now her son and daughter want nothing for Christmas except to have Marley back.

The family have tried to file a complaint with the sheriff's department but were told that they need to contact to the state attorney general’s office.

Daily Mail reached out to the Ray County Sheriff's Office Tuesday but was told that Sheriff Gary Bush will not be available for comment until after the winter holidays.
