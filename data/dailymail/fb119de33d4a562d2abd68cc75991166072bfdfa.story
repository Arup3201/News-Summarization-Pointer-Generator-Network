Labour frontbencher Chuka Umunna has been dogged by claims he has pushed the idea that he is the UK's answer to Barack Obama

Labour rising star Chuka Umunna last night said he had ‘no recollection’ of doctoring his Wikipedia page to include flattering comparisons with Barack Obama.

The shadow business secretary has always said he dislikes the comparisons with the US President that have punctuated his political career.

When it was reported at the weekend that his Wikipedia entry had been doctored in 2008 to include a link to a flattering profile of him that made the Obama association, his spokesman said it may have been done by a campaign supporter.

But last night it emerged the change had been made from a computer at the law firm where Mr Umunna worked before entering Parliament in 2010.

Tory MPs said he appeared to have given himself an ‘internet facelift’, and urged him to come clean.

Mr Umunna’s spokesman said the Labour frontbencher had ‘no recollection’ of changing his Wikipedia page, but offered no explanation of how it had come to be changed from his former place of work.

Tory MP Keith Simpson said: ‘The trouble with changing one’s own profile page on Wikipedia is that it’s rather like an internet facelift – you can always see the stretch marks.’

A public relations expert said Mr Umunna’s response was a ‘PR crime’.

Stuart Bell, co-founder of the PR firm DawBell, said: ‘A quote including “no recollection” for this particular situation is a PR crime. Phrases such as “I can’t say for certain” almost scream out “yes, it was me, I did it”.’

In public the MP for Streatham has played down the comparison with Obama, claiming ‘it annoys me a bit’.

Shortly
after being elected he said: ‘You get lazy journalists and the odd 
blogger who’ll suggest that I fancy myself as “Britain’s Obama”, and 
that I seek to encourage the comparison.

‘It’s never been something I’ve 
encouraged. I want people to look at me as me, not through the prism of 
someone else’s personality.’

‘Socialdemocrat’ created Mr Umunna’s Wikipedia page on October 27, 2007, and appeared to have a highly detailed knowledge of his career.

That user has only edited two other Wikipedia pages, one of which belongs to Compass, a left-wing pressure group. Mr Umunna was on its management committee.

The other was the entry for columnist Kelvin Mackenzie, who had a robust exchange with Mr Umunna on the BBC’s Question Time.

Mr Umunna has used the term ‘social democrat’ to describe himself several times, and once told the Black Socialist Society that it was time to change its name as ‘the Labour Party today is not socialist but social democratic’.

Mr Umunna, a former lawyer and DJ, was forced to apologise last week after it emerged that he had described patrons of London’s nightclubs as ‘trash’ and ‘C-list wannabes’.

He made the remarks as a member of ASmallWorld, an invitation-only social networking site which has been described as MySpace for millionaires.

Conservative MP Nigel Adams said: ‘Comrade Chuka’s not doing his credibility much good this week. Like most champagne socialists, they talk a good game about standing up for the working man but are as transparent as a Gucci shop window.’

A Tory source said: ‘The only thing Chuka Umunna seems interested in is shameless self-promotion. It’s laughable for him to compare himself to Obama.

‘He says one thing in public and does another behind closed doors. Who is ever going to believe a word he says ever again?’

Mr Umunna told the Telegraph: ‘I don’t have any recollection of that log in or any of the changes. But I can’t say for certain that someone with my campaign did not set up that log in.’

He added that while he does not edit his own Wikipedia page, ‘my staff have had to correct it when it has been vandalised by racists and people of that type’.
