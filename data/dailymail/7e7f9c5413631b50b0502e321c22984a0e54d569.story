Iain Duncan Smith’s wife has spoken for the first time about her battle with breast cancer.

Betsy Duncan Smith, pictured, who has been married to the work and pensions secretary for 32 years, said: ‘My cancer was found very late. I didn’t pick up any of the signs.

‘Breast cancer took over my life for two years, the first bit was the worst. I couldn’t see a way out of it.’ After her diagnosis, the mother-of-four had to have six months of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.

She added: ‘My energy levels went to zero. There were days I couldn’t walk. On occasion, I couldn’t even talk. Iain had to bring his office home and look after me. It must have been very worrying for him, poor chap, but he’s coped brilliantly.’

Mrs Duncan Smith, 55, who lost her hair during the treatment, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘That didn’t bother me in the slightest. It was the least of my problems.

‘Eventually I started getting stronger. I’m out of it now but I’m still checked.’

Speaking to the Daily Mail following his wife’s diagnosis, Mr Duncan Smith – who has been dubbed the quiet man of politics – said: ‘Betsy told me the doctor feared it was cancer. He was correct. It took my breath away.

‘I said, “Right, I’m coming home”. I went straight back to my office, picked up my bag and caught the train. I didn’t come back to Parliament for some time after that.’

His wife now supports cancer-detection dog charity Medical Detection Dogs. They can sniff out chemical changes in their owners and alert them. 

Mrs Duncan Smith – who lives near the charity’s Buckinghamshire headquarters – said: ‘A friend asked me to come along and see what the charity did. I was pretty reluctant. I had just had breast cancer, and had a rough time for two years with the treatment.

‘So the last thing I wanted at that point was to get involved with anything concerning cancer. But when I was finally persuaded to visit, I was quite simply blown away.’ She said she has now adopted one of the charity’s cocker spaniels.
