Freedom: Joland Giwa, 24, walking the streets today after being released from prison, said he was a rapper and not a gangster

A 'dangerous' gang leader jailed for robbery who is free to walk the streets because the Government has been unable to deport him claimed today: 'I'm not a gangster - I'm a gangsta rapper'.

Jolan Giwa, 24, was the ‘general’ of an 80-strong gang behind a spate of stabbings, shootings and killings.

The thug is still in Britain because immigration officials have been unable to determine his nationality and both Nigeria and Sierra Leone have refused to take him.

Giwa arrived at Heathrow on a flight from Nigeria in 1999 and claimed asylum after telling officials he was a ten-year-old from Sierra Leone whose parents were killed in its civil war.

His
 asylum claim was refused but he was given permission to stay for four 
years, before being given a permanent right to stay in 2005.

After being released from prison, the thug has been moved to a bail hostel 
in Newport, South Wales.

He claimed today that his infamous street gang Don't Say Nothing are a band of rappers imitating 50 Cent and Tupac - and not hardened criminals.

He said: 'It was about making music. We did think we were gangsters because that’s what you think with American hip hop.

'But it was more of a group of friends that would play football together and stuff.'

Giwa appeared in YouTube videos where 
claimed to be 'the f***ing general' and bragged of 'shanking' his rivals
 - street slang for stabbing.

Police said Giwa had a 'clear propensity for violence' and posed a 'serious threat to the public'.

He
 was jailed for 27 months in February 2009 for robbery and theft before 
later using a phone smuggled into prison to post a picture of himself 
pumping iron in his cell.

At the end of his sentence, he was detained at Belmarsh Prison as border chiefs made efforts to deport him.

But those efforts failed, and he eventually had to be released.

Father-of-two
 Giwa, who has not seen his children since 2007, claims to be a 'family 
man' who has put his violent past behind him.

He said: 'I’m a changed man - since being in Newport I’ve not had any contact with any gangs.

'This is a great area - it’s only fair I treat this place with respect and give back to Newport.

'I was 17 when I was convicted and those were the last crimes I was involved in. I never think I’m perfect but I think the way I’ve been targeted is worse than a terrorist - I have never killed anyone.

'I’m not a violent person, nobody is scared of me, I’m not a harm to the public.'

The Home Office are still attempting to kick Giwa out of Britain.

Newport MP Paul Flynn spoke of his 'deep outrage and anger' that Giwa was moved to the bail hostel in the suburban street.

He wrote to the Home Office asking why a 'dangerous criminal’ has been ordered to live in Newport.

In the letter, Mr Flynn wrote: 'This person presents a problem for London and the rest of England. What was the process that determined that he, and the danger he represents, should be re-located to Wales and Newport?

'What other areas were considered and what consultations were held with Newport representatives? If unpalatable decisions are unavoidable, London should be responsible for its own problems and not seek to dump them on Wales and Newport.'

Mr Flynn said he is also sending his letter to the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, Keith Vaz MP, urging an investigation.
