A Muslim convert who plotted to attack soldiers at Wootton Bassett had a daughter shortly before he was sentenced to six years in prison, it was revealed today.

Richard Dart's wife gave birth to a baby girl 12 weeks premature, according to his brother Robb Leech, but soon afterwards the child's father was jailed for preparing acts of terrorism.

Filmmaker Mr Leech also described how Dart convinced him that he had renounced terror - only to be caught planning to team up with the Taliban and assassinate British spy chiefs.

Writing in The Times today, Mr Leech said: 'While he was in custody before the trial, Rich's new wife gave birth to a daughter, 12 weeks early.

'Now healthy with a life full of possibilities ahead of her, she will need a father and someone to guide her through the world. My only hope is that when Rich gets out, his little daughter will be his calling.'

Mr Leech previously made a documentary, My Brother the Islamist, about how his stepbrother Dart, 30, went from being a normal Western young man who worked as a BBC security guard to an Islamic radical who wandered the streets of London warning locals they faced 'hellfire'.

He spent time with Dart and his fellow jihadists, who incessantly talked about how they longed to go in Afghanistan and fight against the West's troops.

'They all talk about it, all the time,' he wrote. 'It's something to aspire to - fighting jihad and dying a martyr is like winning The X Factor for them.'

Jailed: Dart was sentenced to six years in prison last month after admitting to the terrorist plot

But after his film was broadcast in 2011, Mr Leech believed that Dart - who as a teenager taught him how to smoke and told him which clothes to wear if he wanted to be cool - had turned away from violence.

When they met, rather than trying to convert his brother to Islam, Dart would talk about his plan to set up a business selling a special paste for Muslims designed to keep away evil spirits.

So when he was arrested in July last year, Mr Leech assumed the police had made a mistake - but eventually he realised that his brother had been deceiving him.

In March, Dart pleaded guilty to conspiring with two other Islamists to attack soldiers at Royal Wootton Bassett and target the heads of MI5 and MI6.

Mr Leech wrote in The Times that when he saw his brother in the dock at the Old Bailey, he was suddenly seized with 'a profound and ridiculous giggle' as he was overcome with emotion.

Catching his brother's eye, he wrote, 'We became naughty kids at the back of the class whose hilarity intensifies as the teacher becomes more angry.

'It was like he was saying: "Oops, did I not mention any of this?"'

When Dart was sentenced last month, he refused to stand in the dock, telling the judge: 'Judgment is only for Allah.'

Co-conspirators Jahangir Alom, 26, a former Met police community support officer, and unemployed Imran Mahmood, 22, also received prison sentences over the terror plans.
