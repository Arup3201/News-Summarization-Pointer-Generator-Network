It was classed as a family night of comedy for charity.

But while the BBC’s Comic Relief evening raised millions it also prompted complaints after ill-advised sketches containing explicit sexual references were aired more than hour before the 9pm watershed.

Dozens of parents – many of whom watched the show with their young children – have complained to the corporation since it was shown on Friday night.

In one scene screened at 7.45pm on BBC1, Rowan Atkinson, playing the Archbishop of Canterbury, told viewers that Jesus said love your neighbours ‘but it doesn’t mean s*** your neighbours’.

A sketch from Call the Midwife 
followed with a reference to a ‘vajazzle’, a type of erotic decoration 
used by women and popularised by the downmarket reality TV show The Only
Way is Essex.

Comedian Peter Kay also sat on his 
‘a***’ for the charity event leading to parents complaining that their 
children started using the term.

Lindsay Bruce, who was watching the 
show with her children Micah, five, and Corban, one, in Middlesbrough, 
said: ‘It saddened me that I had to switch off.’

Trisha Telfer, from Edinburgh, 
complained after watching the show with her seven-year-old brother and 
his friend of the same age. She said: ‘The little girl asked me, “what’s
s*******?” – I shouldn’t have to explain this to a seven-year-old.’

Red Nose Day raised a record 
£75million through donations and sponsorship, with singer Jessie J 
making £500,000 alone by shaving her head.

The BBC said that it was ‘known for 
pushing the boundaries of comedy’ but admitted pulling the repeat of the
Archbishop sketch on its iPlayer service following a ‘surge of emails 
and calls’ complaining about the offensive language.

Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman 
of the commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: ‘I’m 
pleased the BBC has recognised this was a mistake and whether Ofcom 
decides to investigate further is a matter up to them.’

In another gaffe, comedian John 
Bishop had to apologise after insulting people from Newcastle upon Tyne 
during his live presenting slot alongside Davina McCall. They were 
discussing Miranda Hart’s week of fundraising, which included organising
a dog show in Oxford.

Bishop, 46, said: ‘I’m glad they put 
it all in that order and the dog show was in Oxford and not Newcastle. 
It wouldn’t be very good having a dog show with Rottweilers.’

He quickly backtracked, but only 
seemed to make things worse by saying: ‘I do love people of the North 
East, please don’t send your dogs down here.’

 Later, on Twitter the Liverpudlian 
comedian wrote: ‘To the people of Newcastle no offence was intended by 
anything I said tonight – it’s a live show, off the cuff jokes were not 
meant to upset x’
One Twitter user wrote: ‘John Bishop calling geordie girls dogs and that
we all headbutt each other. pretty sure he’s from liverpool... cough, 
awkward.’

The criticism comes days after the 
corporation was forced to leave out a Comic Relief performance by 
Frankie Boyle after he made vile jokes about the Queen and the pregnant 
Duchess of Cambridge.

The Scottish comedian was booed by 
the crowd as he joked that he wished the Queen had died, and made an 
unprintable gag about how Kate became pregnant.

In the ten-minute routine on Russell 
Brand’s Give It Up For Comic Relief event at Wembley Arena, Boyle also 
drew gasps from the 12,500-strong audience with a particularly crude 
jibe at Oscar Pistorious.

Boyle’s routine was axed from the ‘almost-live’ broadcast of the show on BBC Three.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Rowan is well 
known for his comedy characters and this was an affectionate portrayal 
of an Archbishop figure, which was intended to amuse and entertain. We 
did not mean to cause any offence.’

Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, is assessing complaints before deciding what action to take.
