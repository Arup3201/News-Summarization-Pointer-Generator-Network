The Bayern Munich squad fought off the harsh winter chill  as they reported for training at the icy Sabener Strasse training facility in Munich on Wednesday.

Despite the sub-zero conditions that have hit the Munich area in the last few days, the Bayern players were in warm spirits as they set to wrap up preparations for their upcoming fixture against Wolfsburg on Friday under the watchful eye of a snowman mascot.

Bundesliga leaders Bayern are 11 points clear of second-placed Wolfsburg at the top of the table and are still unbeaten in the league.

Coach Pep Guardiola - who is renowned for his dedication to the cause - heaped on the layers in the numbing conditions, but refused to cover his bare head... which was no doubt feeling the cold. 

The 23-time German top tier champions are still in the mix for all the major competitions, and  Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was full of praise for the former Barcelona manager on Tuesday.

'Guardiola works incredibly hard. He is more German than the Germans when it comes to his work ethic,' Rummenigge told Kicker.

'When the players have all long returned home and are relaxing on the sofa, Guardiola is still around and working on a masterplan for the next game.'
