A quick-thinking Florida boy managed to save the life of a little girl after she almost drowned in a swimming pool.

Palmer French, who is six, was at his grandparents house in Wellington, when next door neighbor Scarlett Berger, who is 2, came round to play.

The little girl was sitting on a ledge at the shallow end of the pool when she slipped off and began sinking to the bottom.

Palmer, 6, is a natural in the water.

Best friends: Palmer managed to save the life of the six-year-old girl. Just look at the way she looks at him!

'I think that he's a little hero,' said Tom Mansmith, Palmer's grandfather.

Palmer and his grandpa often play an underwater game where Palmer will swim down to the pool floor and pull his grandfather up. He used the same technique to save Scarlett.

'Palmer just instinctively jumped in, went to the bottom, picked her up and brought her to the surface,' said Mr Mansmith.

'I was not scared. I was brave,' said Palmer.

Luckily, Scarlett's mother was near to the pool as the entire incident occurred and was able to grab her daughter.

'I came over quickly and pulled her out,' said Daniela Berger. 'She can look up to him.'

Modest: 'I was not scared. I was brave,' says Palmer
