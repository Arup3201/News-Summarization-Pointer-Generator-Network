Some academics say such cheating is on the increase because schools are under huge pressure to improve their national league table positions

The shocking lengths cheating teachers go to in order to boost their schools' exam grades has been exposed in a new report.

Blatant cases include staff suggesting the correct answers to pupils during exams, scribbling them in pencil on completed coursework so that pupils can then write over them in pen, and whispering to candidates in spoken language tests.

Some academics say such cheating is on the increase because schools are under huge pressure to improve their national league table positions. 

In one extreme case last year, unconnected to the new report, the entire governing body of a school was dissolved and eight members of staff were suspended over allegations of exam irregularities, although five have since been reinstated.

The examples of cheating are contained in guidance to exam boards about how to deal with 'malpractice' in this summer's A-level and GCSE exams, published by umbrella body the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ). Examples included:

- A timetable clash that meant several candidates sat an A-level English Literature paper in the morning when it was officially scheduled for the afternoon, allowing a teacher to enter the exam hall, look at the paper and pass information to candidates taking the test later;

- A member of staff who was in the exam room during a GCSE Geography paper suggesting possible answers to pupils when they raised their hands;

- A number of candidates who admitted they had been given information about a confidential GCSE English question papers by the head of the exam centre;

- A teacher who had made additions in pencil to a number of supposedly completed 'high level, controlled' science assessments and returned the answers to the pupils so they could make corrections, which they did in different coloured pens;

- A teacher conducting a GCSE Italian speaking test who was heard on the official recording whispering words in Italian to the candidate and, presumably in an attempt to hide the cheating, pausing the recorder a number of times, in breach of the rules.

Neither the JCQ nor the exam boards were prepared to give further details about the examples yesterday, but the report did record the penalties meted out to the guilty teachers – usually a ban from involvement with exam papers, or access to exam rooms for between two and five years.

The Government's exam watchdog Ofqual issued 119 penalties against school and college staff for malpractice in GCSE and A-levels last summer, up from 100 the previous year.

Showing how widespread the problem is, schools recently investigated include St John's in Marlborough, Wiltshire, where a teacher was said to have briefed pupils during what should have been a silent coursework assessment, and Small Heath primary in Birmingham, where a now former head changed pupils' SATs papers to improve their results.

At Goole High School in Hull, eight members of staff were suspended last September after allegations of exam irregularities. Five have returned to their jobs but two remain suspended pending an internal investigation.

Professor Alan Smithers, director for education and employment research at Buckingham University, said: 'Getting good exam results is tremendously important for schools and if they don't they can be in serious trouble. But the exams are not robust enough to withstand clever cheating and worried teachers can be tempted. The evidence is that cheating by teachers is on the rise.'

And Professor Rob Coe, an expert on exams at Durham University, warned that teachers were losing their 'professional morality', adding: 'It is kind of seen as OK to do things you know are wrong because everyone else is doing them.'

JCQ director general Michael Turner said: 'Having a robust and secure examination system is essential. Awarding organisations take any allegation of malpractice very seriously.'
