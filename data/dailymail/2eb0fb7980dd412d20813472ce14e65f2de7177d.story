The mother of convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has denied her daughter is in a relationship with an Indonesia man who has been arrested for drug possession.

It was revealed on Friday, Corby's boyfriend Ben Panagian was allegedly caught with marijuana after he was searched on a Bali street on August 20 and later found more in his wardrobe.

The 32-year-old faces a maximum of 12 years in prison if he is found guilty, the Herald Sun reported.

Indonesian police allege Ben Panangian was in possession of marijuana

Rosleigh Rose told Nine News was not aware of the specifics of the charge.

But she was adamant that 'Ben [was] not Schapelle's boyfriend'.

'They know each other, that's it,' Ms Rose said.

Her denial comes despite Corby and Panagian being linked as early as 2006 after meeting in jail while both were serving time for drug offences, according to The Australian Women's Weekly.

As Corby is only free on parole in Bali under the condition that she stay away from drugs and crime, she is expected to receive a severe warning and will be monitored more strictly.

Panangian first met Corby behind bars while he was serving time in jail

Police on Friday said they had no plans to investigate Corby because the pair's relationship is unclear.

Panangian, who's previously been locked up for drug charges, was arrested in Nusa Dua at about 6pm with two packages of marijuana.

Police said they seized a total of nine grams of cannabis and arrested him under the name Bernanrd P. Simanjunta.

Witnesses confirmed the man was Corby's boyfriend.

Corby was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of marijuana to Indonesia.

The 37-year-old got back with her Indonesian boyfriend who supported her while she was locked-up a couple of months after her release from jail, Daily Mail Australia reported in July.

The two reportedly met when they were both inmates serving time in prison.

Parole board boss Ketut Artha says officers will now watch the convicted drug smuggler more closely.

He may also personally warn her about the company she is keeping - but he won't revoke her parole.

'With this case, we will tighten supervision for her,' he said on Friday.

'We will also warn her and visit her more often.

'Early next month she is due to report [to the parole office] and we will warn her.'

Corby's parole officer also said she never mentioned a boyfriend in her counselling sessions.

Corby was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of cannabis to Indonesia 

In 2004, she was stopped by officers at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar and was caught with 4.2 kilograms of marijuana in her boogie board bag.

She was sentenced 20 years behind bars in 2005 but was later granted a five-year sentence reduction.

While imprisoned, Corby claimed she suffered from extreme depression and shared with a psychiatrist her thoughts on suicide.

Her parole conditions state that she must not be involved with crime.

She lives with her sister, Mercedes, in the tourist area of Kuta.

It's believed she now works at her sister's surfboard and swimwear shop on the island.
