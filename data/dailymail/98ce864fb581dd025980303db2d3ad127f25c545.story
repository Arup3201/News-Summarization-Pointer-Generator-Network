Prince Harry was launched into a new leading role in the royal family last night when he took centre stage at the Olympic closing ceremony.

In his most important solo Royal engagement yet, the third in line to the throne was selected as the figurehead for the spectacular farewell to the Games, which the Queen opened two weeks ago.

The high-profile task of celebrating Britain’s glory at London 2012 fell to the 27-year-old prince, sitting alongside the Duchess of Cambridge, after a succession of prominent appearances in the crowd at many of the history-making events of the competition.

He stepped in after his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, had to return to work as a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot at RAF Valley in North Wales.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who have been following the Games closely, always agreed they would only attend the opening ceremony.

It was part of a plan to leave the Games to the younger 
members of the family notably the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 
and Prince Harry who were official Team GB Ambassadors.

Last night in a stirring written 
message, Harry said the Games had been ‘extraordinary’, and added: ‘They
 will stay in the hearts and minds of people all over the world for a 
very long time to come.

‘I congratulate all the athletes who have competed. They have shown us that there are few boundaries to human endeavour.’

The spirit of the Olympics, he said, 
represented ‘a magnificent force for positive change’. The athletes, he 
said, had ‘captured the imagination of the world’.

His appearance on behalf of the Queen 
also cemented his image in the public eye as a prince of the people, a 
down-to-earth ambassador for what has been widely acclaimed one of the 
best things to happen to Britain for decades.

Although he wasn't present last night, Prince Charles did attend the Queen’s official 
Buckingham Palace reception for heads of state as well as the opening 
ceremony followed by the men’s cycling and badminton on the opening 
Saturday before heading off to Scotland on holiday.

Whilst staying at his Birkhall estate he even attended his local highland games.

His wife the Duchess of Cornwall 
stayed on in London for a few days to attend the eventing in Greenwich 
Park as Patron of the British Equestrian Federation but then headed to 
Scotland to join him.

The Queen similarly attended the 
opening ceremony and was shown round the Olympic Park the following day 
before heading off to her own estate north of the border, Balmoral.

In a separate message, the Queen 
congratulated the athletes of Great Britain and the Commonwealth, saying
 their efforts had ‘captured the public’s imagination and earned their 
admiration’.

The monarch said Team GB’s success - 
the best performance in more than a century - would inspire a new 
generation of Olympians and remind everyone how sport 'unifies 
communities and nations'.

The Queen herself played a starring 
role in the opening ceremony for the Games, featuring in pre-recorded 
film scenes with Daniel Craig starring as James Bond, before appearing 
to parachute from a helicopter into the stadium.

More than two weeks on, she said: ‘As 
the 2012 London Olympic Games come to a close, I offer my 
congratulations to the athletes of Great Britain and the Commonwealth, 
whose efforts across the range of Olympic disciplines have truly 
captured the public’s imagination and earned their admiration.'

‘The outstanding performance of Team 
GB, in achieving the greatest Olympic success since 1908, will, I am 
sure, have inspired a new generation of Olympians and reminded us all 
how sport unifies communities and nations.

‘I congratulate, too, the organisers 
of the Games, as well as the thousands of volunteers who have epitomised
 the Olympic spirit through the warm welcome they have shown to the 
sporting teams and spectators from all around the world.

‘As a nation, we now look forward to the Paralympic Games and wish all athletes every success.’

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh 
will also hold a reception for the 2012 Great Britain Olympic Team in 
Buckingham Palace on October 23.

Prince Harry has been a frequent 
presence at the Games, enthusiastically cheering our rowers and other 
athletes, enjoying the beach volleyball and watching his cousin Zara 
Phillips win an equestrian team silver medal.

He and his brother Prince William gave
 an extraordinary TV interview last week in which they spoke with 
chat-show casualness about how much they were enjoying the Olympics.

His clear appreciation of Team GB’s 
performance, and the image it promoted for the nation, earned praise and
 thanks from both athletes and organisers.

Likewise from fellow servicemen at 
Stratford - Harry is an Apache helicopter pilot and chatted easily with 
troops at the stadium. None of it would have been possible, he told us 
last night, without the work of everyone who helped to bring the Games 
in London to fruition.

So it was Harry who waved goodbye to 
them yesterday, while the Queen and his father Prince Charles stood 
aside.

Kate took a seat alongside her young brother-in-law but it was he
 who gave the formal message of goodwill, the first page of the closing 
ceremony programme.
