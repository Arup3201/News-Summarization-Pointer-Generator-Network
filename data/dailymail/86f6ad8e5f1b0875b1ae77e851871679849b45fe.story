British holidaymakers are looking to alternative ski destinations after the Alps experienced one of the worst starts to a season in living memory, a new study suggests.

Online searches for destinations in Norway have soared while queries for traditional getaways in France have plummeted by more than half, according to travel website Kayak.

The sudden interest in Norwegian resorts reflects the perfect conditions at the country’s ski runs.

A study by Kayak suggests that interest in Norwegian ski resorts has soared after the Alps' slow start

Year-over-year increase in searches: 

Year-over-year decrease in searches: 

Nearly all of Norway’s pistes are open with a snow depth of more than 45in on the summit and 40in at the base of the slope.

Kayak said searches for flights going to Kristiansund Airport have doubled over last year, while searches for Chambery Airport in the French Alps have decreased by 56 per cent.

Until a blizzard hit in late December – stranding thousands of holidaymakers – France's top skiing destinations were mostly void of snow and openings were delayed at resorts where slopes were bare.

It came after a spell of unseasonably warm weather that was responsible for one of the ‘least snowy’ winters in the French Alps in 35 years.

Kayak said Denver, Calgary, Helsinki and Vancouver airports – all located near popular skiing destinations – have also seen a surge of interest.

In comparison searches to all five of the Alps’ main airports, including Chambery, are down, according to the travel website.

The others are Friedrichshagen, Germany (down 37 per cent), Grenoble (down 26 per cent), Lyon (down 14 per cent) and Geneva (down four per cent).

Loella Pehrsson, regional managing director for Kayak, said: ‘It’s clear that the lack of snow in the Alps has had a big impact on searches to airports around the region with Brits looking elsewhere in search of snow.’

The study was based on flight searches between 1 December and 7 January for travel between the dates of 12 January and 1 April.
