A young mother arrived home on Sunday to make the horrifying discovery that her mother and brother had been shot dead 'execution style'. 

Heather Muller Kunf, 29, found the bodies of her mom Donna Muller, 49, and brother Rich Muller, 22, each with a gunshot wound to the back of the head at the family's Philadelphia home.

Neighbors reported hearing screams coming from the row house in the quiet suburb of Lawncrest around 3pm on Sunday after Ms Muller Kunf entered the house.

Heather Muller Kunf, 29, (pictured with her young daughter) found her mother and brother shot dead at the home they shared in a quiet Philadelphia neighborhood on Sunday afternoon

Donna Muller's body was found in her bedroom and her college graduate son was found in the hallway by the family's 29-year-old daughter.

Ms Muller Kunf's young daughter Kaitlyn was not with her at the time. 

Each victim had one gunshot wound to the back of the head, according to KYW.

Ms Muller Kunf discovered her mom and brother after returning home around 3pm from an overnight stay at her boyfriend's house.

Ms Kunf had taken her young daughter along with her mother on a trip to Disney World just before Christmas.

No suspects have been named but police had recovered a single shell casing from the home.

Investigators believe a semi-automatic rifle was used in the killings 
but found no sign of a forced entry that might suggest a robbery. A 
murder suicide had also been ruled out.

Donna Muller has been separated for many years from ex-husband Richard Muller, a convict with a violent past.

‘It's definitely a violent crime scene because you have two dead bodies that appear to be shot in the head,’ Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small told WPVI.

‘We don’t have a motive at this time,’ Chief Small told KYW. ‘However, we have several witnesses that were transported to homicide, and they’re being interviewed by homicide detectives right now.’

A search of criminal records shows 
ex-husband Richard Muller has a violent past including convictions for 
aggravated assault, burglary and driving under the influence of alcohol 
or a controlled substance.

He served almost 15 years in prison for those crimes after a plea deal led to other charges of criminal mischief, criminal trespass, making terroristic threats, simple assault and recklessly endangering another person being dropped.

Richard Muller was also convicted last year of public drunkenness. It is not clear what punishment was handed down for that conviction.

He has not been named a suspect by police and a call by MailOnline to his Philadelphia home went unanswered.

Crime scene: The block was teeming with police as they investigated the double homicide

Neighbors reported hearing gunshots in the early hours in the quiet, mostly residential Lawncrest neighborhood in the northeast part of the city.

Footage from the scene showed police had cordoned off the row house as crying relatives were seen being interviewed by homicide detectives.

One neighbor said he heard gun shots overnight.

‘I just heard two pops,’ Peter Riley told WPVI.

Another neighbor said his wife heard fighting in the early morning hours.

‘She said she heard a lot of banging and noise at 3:30 this morning,’ John Downey added.

Police have told neighbors they have no reason to be concerned for their safety but many are shaken up by the violent deaths.

‘It’s crazy, you know? You don’t know what to think when it happens on your own block just a few doors down,’ one told KYW.

‘You don’t know what to say, I don’t know what to say – it’s a shame,’ a neighbour told WCAU. ‘They’re nice people, they don’t deserve it.’

In a statement to MailOnline, the Philadelphia Police Department said: 'On January, 19, at 3.18pm, Police personnel responded to... a double homicide.

'Upon arrival they located on the second floor 49-year-old Donna Muller and her son, 22-year-old Richard Muller. Both victims were shot in the head and pronounced on location at 3.31pm. The motive is unknown and the investigation is ongoing with the Homicide Unit.'

The City of Philadelphia offers a $20,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the suspect(s) in any homicide.
