Taliban militants are hunting down interpreters who worked with US forces in Afghanistan but while many have been allowed to emigrate to America, those who were sacked or placed on a blacklist claim they have been handed a death sentence. 

Thousands of Afghan's have been given visas in recognition for their work with the International Security Assistance Force as it was clear they would not be safe in their own homes. 

But that special dispensation has not been granted for those who were sacked or placed on a blacklist by the US military and those men claim they are being targeted.   

Even those who have not been blacklisted are not safe. Junid Herean, a 26-year-old interpreter for US Army Special Forces, was kidnapped and captured by Taliban operatives earlier this month. 

His death made the situation even more frightening for those who remain.

Nader who claims he was sacked and blacklisted after refusing to carry out an order to shout at Afghan women said that two men tried to execute him earlier this year, as a result of his work. 

'When I realised they were taking me somewhere to be executed I started yelling and fighting,' he told the BBC. 'My brother came out to find me, but by the time he'd come they'd shot me, I just lay down and they left.'

He added that if he had not struggled, he would have been shot in the head and not the leg. 

Another, called Khalid who worked with Special Forces in Helmand province said he was shocked to learn he'd been blacklisted after getting into an argument with a female US civilian.

'I've been shot once, I was taken to a British hospital in Bastion. I've been blown up twice.' he said. 'Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and shout.' 

Some admit they made rudimentary mistakes like taking a mobile phone on patrol, which could have alerted the Taliban to the soldiers presence. Another said he accidentally left a pair of US serviceman's trousers in his bag - a deadly disguise for a suicide bomber.

But other say they were blacklisted after failing a polygraph test designed to root out Taliban sympathisers. The interpreters claim this was unreliable. 

Being placed on the blacklist means an interpreter virtually unemployable, ruled out from work with foreign military forces and companies, along with all branches of the Afghan government, especially the military or police. They are also barred from flying.    

Yet many now claim they are not even safe in the country's capital Kabul.   

'If I get caught anywhere in Kabul right now, they kidnap me, they torture me, they, head off - you know - cut my head off,' said another interpreter Sayid.

Alongside other insurgent groups, the Taliban have escalated attacks across the country since the withdrawal of most of the US led forces from the country last month.

Targeting, government, security and foreign installations, especially Kabul, members of the public have also been caught in the crossfire.

A British security official employed by G4S was among the five people killed this week by a Taliban suicide bomb attack on a British embassy vehicle in the Afghan capital.  

The explosion left 33 other people injured - many of them civilians who had been going about their business along the busy stretch of road running from Kabul to the city of Jalalabad, which lies 95 miles to the east of the Afghan capital. 

The attacks have prompted Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani to order a comprehensive review of the country's defense forces.

He is also rethinking Afghan policy towards controversial night raids, banned by his predecessor Hamid Karzai. 

It was also revealed US President Barack Obama signed a 'secret' order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal. 

Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counter terrorism and training mission for the next two years. 

But none of this makes Nader or his colleagues feel any safer.  

'The only place I was feeling myself was my own home,' he said. 'Now that place has become a combat place for me.'

The US State Department said they are 'committed to supporting those who - at great personal risk - have helped us'
