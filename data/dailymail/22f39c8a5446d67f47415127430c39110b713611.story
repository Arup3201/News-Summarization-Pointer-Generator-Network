Activist women in Togo have today begun a sex strike in a bid to use their sexual power to unseat the president.

Female members of the civil rights group Let's Save Togo are withholding sex from their husbands and partners for a week.

Their aim is to cause the resignation of the President Faure Gnassingbe.

Opposition leader Isabelle Ameganvi calls on Togo's women to observe a one-week sex strike beginning today, in Lome, Togo

Isabelle Ameganvi, leader of the women's rights division of the group said the strike will put pressure on Togo's men to take action.

In Togo, women have equal rights with men to vote and to participate in political life, but in practice, there are few women in positions of leadership, either in formal politics or civil society, according to the OECD's Social Institutions and Gender Index.

The country has been ruled by the same family for decades. President Faure Gnassingbe came to power in 2005, following the death of his father, Eyadema Gnassingbe, who ruled the West African country for 38 years.

The campaign group believe they need the help of the men in the country to force President Gnassingbe to resign.

Gnassingbe has not commented on the 
sex strike, nor has his wife.

The strike was announced at a 
rally on Saturday of several thousand in the capital city, Lome.

The 
demonstration was organised by a coalition that is protesting recent 
electoral reforms, which they say will make it easier for Gnassingbe's 
party to win re-election in the parliamentary polls set for October.Â 

Women in Togo are following the example set by female activists in Liberia in 2003, who withheld sex to campaign for peace

Earlier this month, two anti-Gnassingbe 
protests were dispersed by police using tear gas and more than 100 
people were arrested.

At Saturday's rally, which ended 
peacefully, Jean-Pierre Fabre, leader of the National Alliance for 
Change opposition party, called for Gnassingbe's resignation. Other 
opposition leaders called for civil disobedience.

But it is the sex strike that has people talking in this small country of more than 6 million people.

The Togo women are following the example set by Liberia's women, who used a sex strike in 2003 to campaign for peace.

'We have many means to oblige men to understand what women want in Togo,' Ameganvi, a lawyer, told Associated Press.

Abla Tamekloe, who is participating in the sex strike, believes their actions will raise awareness of those who have been imprisoned in Togo.

'It's a good thing for us women to observe this sex strike as long as our children are in jail now. I believe that by observing this, we will get them released.

'For me, it's like fasting, and unless you fast, you will not get what you want from God.'

When asked if her husband would agree, Tamekloe said: 'It is easy for me to observe it. I am used to it, but I am not sure my husband will accept, but I have to explain to him.'

Another Togolese woman said she supports the sex strike, but she does not know if she can carry it out for a full week.

'I do agree that we women have to observe this sex strike but I know my husband will not let me complete it. He may agree at first, but as far as I know him, he will change overnight,'

Judith Agbetoglo said. 'So I don't believe I can do the one-week sex strike. Otherwise, I will have serious issues with him. He likes that too much.'

Though the call for a sex strike seemed to please many women, some men, including heads of opposition parties and human rights groups in the anti-Gnassingbe coalition, did not believe it would be a success.

The women's sex strike is the latest in a string of recent protests calling for the resignation of the President Faure Gnassingbe. A peaceful protest on Saturday shows a man holding a sign which reads, 'Faure Resign' and cites an article of the constitution that protesters say gives them the right to engage in civil disobedience, during an opposition sit-in in Lome, Togo

'One week sex strike is too much,' said Fabre of the National Alliance for Change, who suggested a shorter period, amid laughter from the crowd at the demonstration. 'Let's go for only two days.'

Others were skeptical of Isabelle Ameganvi's call.

'It is easy for her to say because she is not married herself. She does not live with a man at home,' said Ekoue Blame, a Togolese journalist.

'Does she think women who live with their husband will be able to observe that? By the way, who controls what couples do behind closed doors?'
