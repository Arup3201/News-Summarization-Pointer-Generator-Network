The four men convicted of killing a 23-year-old medical student they raped on a bus in New Delhi should face the death penalty, a prosecutor said today.

The men are set to be sentenced on Friday after they were found guilty of rape and murder yesterday in the case which shocked the world and prompted a widespread movement for women's rights in India.

'They showed no mercy even when she prayed for mercy,' Prosecutor Dayan Krishnan told the court. 'There should be no mercy for merciless convicts.

'The sentence which is appropriate is 
nothing short of death. The common man will lose faith in the judiciary if the harshest 
punishment is not given.'

Plea: One of the men shouted out 'I am innocent!' as the bus passed reporters on its way into court

He
added that 'there can be nothing more diabolic than a helpless girl put
through torture', saying that the crime had shocked India's 'collective
conscience'.

As the killers arrived at court in a police van ahead of the hearing, one of the men called out, 'I am innocent! I am innocent!'

The men - bus cleaner Akshay Kumar Singh,
gym instructor Vinay Sharma, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, and unemployed 
Mukesh Singh - are widely expected to be sentenced to death by judge 
Yogesh Khanna in a final hearing on Friday

Defence lawyer Vivek Sharma today called for the defendants to be given life in prison - the most lenient sentence possible - and said that the different roles each of them played in the crime should be taken into account.

He said that judges should not be 'bloodthirsty', adding: 'You can't give capital punishment on demand.'

The four men showed no emotion as lawyers laid out their arguments - it is unclear whether or not they understood the proceedings, which were held in English.

The family of the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sat a few feet away from her killers.

They were among six people accused of tricking the woman and her male companion into boarding an off-duty bus on December 16 after they had seen a matinee showing of Life of Pi at a shopping mall.

They then raped her using a metal bar to inflict massive internal injuries before beating her friend. The victims were dumped naked on the roadside and the woman died from her injuries two weeks later.

One of the other suspects apparently committed suicide while in prison, and a 17-year-old boy convicted of 
involvement in the attack was sentenced to three years in prison.

Speaking outside court yesterday, the 
father of the victim said: 'Now the court has held them guilty, we want them hanged. 
We expect nothing else but the death sentence.'

As the men were told the verdicts in the courtroom, chants of 'hang them' could be heard echoing outside.

One of the four is to launch an appeal over his conviction claiming he was simply driving the bus when the attack took place and was unaware of what was happening inside.

The crime, which left the victim with 
such extensive internal injuries that she died two weeks later, sparked 
widespread protests across the country and led to reforms of India's 
antiquated sexual violence laws.

Their conviction comes a week after their teenage accomplice was jailed for three years for his part in the atrocity, escaping with a lenient sentence because he was under 18 at the time of the attack.

The sixth accused, bus driver Ram Singh, was found dead in his jail cell in March.

Reading out yesterday's verdict, Judge Yogesh Khanna said the men had committed 'murder of a helpless person.'

Convicted: It comes after a teenager was convicted in August following a separate trial

Anger: Indian women participate in a silent procession to mourn the death of the gang rape victim

AP Singh, a lawyer for the men, said 
all were innocent. 'These accused have been framed simply to please the 
public,' he told reporters. 'This is not a fair trial.

Outside
the courthouse, where dozens of protesters had gathered, a chant began 
quickly after the verdict: 'Hang Them! Hang Them! Hang Them!'

Protesters called the case a wake-up call for India.

'Every
girl at any age experiences this - harassment or rape. We don't feel 
safe,' said law school graduate Rapia Pathania. 'That's why we're here. 
We want this case to be an example for every other case that has been 
filed and will be filed.'
