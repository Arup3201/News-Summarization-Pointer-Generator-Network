A Kentucky man killed his brother Sunday and then tried to hide the evidence by dragging the corpse down a rural road for nearly two miles before leaving it on the shoulder, police said.

Vernon Saunders, 56, of Versailles, is accused of murdering Timothy Saunders, 51, whose body was found by motorist who initially thought it was a deer that had been hit by a car.

The older brother admitted to investigators he shot an 'intruder' three times before tying him to a pickup truck and dragging him down the road, court documents cited by WLEX revealed.

Vernon Saunders then 'came home and cleaned a mess,' an indication he 'attempted to wash away the crime scene,' said the affidavit.

No motive has yet been established, but 
the younger brother had recently relocated from Florida to stay with his
 accused killer, sources told WLEX.

‘When he went by, he said there was a bunch of deer in the area. First he thought it was a deer that had been hit,’ Versailles Police Lt. Daniel Clark told the station.

‘Then he turned and came back again and saw that it was a person lying there.’

Evidence at the scene plus a trail of blood down the road led investigators to Vernon Saunders’ home about two miles away, sources told WKYT.

Police immediately uncovered signs a homicide had taken place and knew a person was inside the home, according to the station.

'We made a determination based on evidence found outside the residence that the residence could very well be connected to the body that was found. We had reason to believe that there was someone inside,' Clark added.

Vernon Saunders barricaded himself inside and a SWAT team was called in. He emerged three hours later and was arrested, according to WTVQ. 

Neighbors said Vernon Saunders, a carpenter and avid amateur photographer, lived in the rental home no more than three years and that they barely knew him.

It is not clear if either man has a family.

The accused killer is listed as single on his Facebook profile.

Timothy Saunders’ body was sent to the coroner to determine the exact cause of death, cops said. Results should be available as early as Monday.

His brother Vernon was charged with murder, tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse - he is being held without bail.
