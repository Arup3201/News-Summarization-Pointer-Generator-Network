Four men have been handed a new injunction dubbed the 'Gang-bo' barring them from stepping on to the 'turf' of a rival gang after six underworld shootings in just three weeks.

Jacob Harrison and Leevon Birchall, both 19, Kane Stafford, 21, and 22-year old Carne Thomasson, were handed the anti-gang injunctions stopping them from entering parts of Salford, Greater Manchester, following a feud.

The men also cannot communicate with each other and named associates that police say are involved in organised crime. The injunctions are not criminal convictions but civil orders and anyone caught breaching the injunction faces up to two years in prison.

The turf war broke out last month following a petty dispute between the two gangs which is thought to have arisen out of a minor 'respect' argument.

In the first incident on September 9, the window of a car was shot at. The following day police were called to a suburban street after reports of gunfire.

On September 13 armed police were called to more reports of gunshots and on September 25, shots were fired at the front door and through the window of two houses in separate shootings.

Later two men, aged 19 and 22, were arrested in connection with another shooting, which saw shots fired at the glass-panelled front door at teatime on September 27. Both men were freed on bail.

One man, aged 18 was arrested and charged with possession of a firearm after officers recovered a loaded firearm.

Gang: Leevon Birchall, 19, left, and Carne Thomasson, 22, right, are also subject to the orders. Armed patrols are now patrolling the streets of Salford and a number of 'threat to life' notices have been issued to people

No one has been injured in any of the shootings.

However, armed patrols are now patrolling the streets of Salford and a number of ‘threat-to-life’ notices issued to people believed to be involved in the feud.

Salford Council applied for the interim civil orders last month in an emergency court session.

Officers told a judge at Manchester County Court that they needed to 'minimise the risk of further violence.'

The orders will be in place for 12 months and will be reviewed next year.

Harrison, Thomasson and Birchall are all forbidden from entering the Duchy or Ellesmere Park estates. Harrison and Birchall are also banned from venturing onto a road in Irlam’s o’th Height in Salford.

Stafford, is forbidden from entering the City of Salford itself except by travelling on the M60 motorway without exiting or to attend pre-arranged medical or dental appointments and only with prior notice given to police.

All four men are now under 9pm to 5am curfews with a door step condition to present themselves to a police officer on request.

Don Brown, a retired Det Chief Supt, now assistant director for community safety at Salford council, said: 'This is the first time we have used these powers to minimise the risk of further gang-related violence in our communities.

'We work extremely closely with police to tackle those thought to be involved in serious organised crime and we have a variety of initiatives to help prevent young people from becoming involved in criminality.

'To ensure our communities are as safe as possible we will continue to use all the powers available to us to disrupt criminals, their activities and ensure Salford is as safe as possible.'

Chief Supt Kevin Mulligan of Greater Manchester Police said: 'I hope that these positive steps will encourage others to now speak to local police and partners and let us know who exactly is causing the problems within Salford.'

He added: 'The answers to this dispute undoubtedly lie in the community and I would ask that if anyone does have information, that they come forward - in confidence if needed - so we can arrest those involved and take these firearms off the streets.'

Police are now using the same tactics in Salford that helped drive down gun crime in neighbouring Moss Side by 80 per cent.

The tactics - now used by other police forces up and down the UK - include detectives getting close to known criminals, and steering them away from trouble if possible. If they fail to behave, however, police come down hard.

Known gang members are regularly stop-checked in the street and - if they have been arrested - officers make regular trips to their homes to make sure they stick to their curfews.
