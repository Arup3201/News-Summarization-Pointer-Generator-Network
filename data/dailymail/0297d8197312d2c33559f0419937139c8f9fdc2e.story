Home comforts have helped Luke Shaw finally find his feet at Manchester United.

United fans voted Shaw man of the match on Saturday after an energetic and uplifting display in the 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace.

The 19-year-old impressed throughout and almost scored his first professional goal after a surging 50-yard run which started from his own half.

Shaw has endured a rocky start to his career at Old Trafford. He turned up to pre-season training out of shape and many questioned why the club had allowed long-serving left-back Patrice Evra to leave.

But four months on, he has found contentment.

'I feel at home now,' the England left-back told Press Association Sport.

'Everyone has been really good with me, not just the players but the staff as well.

'They have made me feel really welcome and now I just want to keep on improving, working hard in training and get the best out of myself.'

A key component in Shaw's improvement has, it seems, been the relocation of his parents from Surrey to the north-west.

'It's a new surrounding for me but the best thing is that my family have come up with me,' said Shaw, who lived in digs with his young Southampton team-mates until his transfer.

'My Mum and Dad are here so I'm not just a 19-year-old living up here by myself.

'I have a good structure at home and good people around me.

'It makes me feel more comfortable. It helped me settle because even at Southampton I never lived with them but it's nice to be with them and to even spend time with my family.'

Shaw frankly admitted on United's tour of the United States that he had under-estimated the challenge of playing for a club that claims to be the biggest in the world.

That is why he was far from his physical peak when he turned up on his first day at United.

But after making several appearances at commercial events - the latest one being for United's global noodle partner Nissin on Saturday evening - he is fully aware of the demands being placed upon him.

'I am used to it now, it's part of my job,' he said.

'You need to get used to it quickly because there is lots of things to do here commercially and on the pitch.'

Just a couple of hours before his appearance at the event, Shaw had brought the Old Trafford crowd to their feet with his run and low shot on goal which Julian Speroni just managed to tip wide.

Former United full-back Phil Neville said it reminded him of Gareth Bale.

The teenager promises the United support that will not be the last time they see that this season.

'It's something I have in my ability and I think I can do more of it,' Shaw said.

'When chances come for me like that I tend to run forward like that. It was a good save. Hopefully soon a goal will come.'

Back in their prime, Evra and Denis Irwin used to raise the volume at Old Trafford with similar runs.

Shaw has lofty ambitions to match the achievements of the pair.

'There is Patrice Evra and Denis Irwin that are top quality left backs and I just want to come here and prove to everyone that I can be just as good as them two legends,' he said.

Shaw hopes Saturday's win, which came courtesy of Juan Mata's second-half strike, will help United move up the table after their unconvincing start.

'Hopefully that win can kick start our season,' he said.

'We haven't had the best run in the last few games so it was a massive win.'
