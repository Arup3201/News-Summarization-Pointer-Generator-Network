David Cameron has been challenged to get off the beach and campaign to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom - by Alex Salmond. 

Mr Salmond laid down the challenge after it emerged the Prime Minister did not interrupt his summer holiday in Cornwall to watch last night’s live TV debate on Scottish independence.

The Prime Minister also failed to tune in to the first clash between Mr Salmond and Alistair Darling – despite claiming it would ‘break my heart’ to see the United Kingdom broken up.

Today, Mr Salmond said the PM was the real leader of the 'No' to independence campaign, adding: 'Let’s have him in Scotland now, let’s see if he can do any better that Alistair Darling did.'

The revelation risks reigniting accusations that Mr Cameron is too complacent about crucial matters of state – including Britain’s deepening role in the Iraq crisis and the possibility of the breakup of the United Kingdom.

Mr Cameron returns to Downing Street tomorrow – from his third holiday this year – with less than three weeks to go before next month’s historic referendum on September 18.

He will arrive back in London amid growing confidence within the ‘Yes’ to independence campaign, following last night’s crushing victory for Mr Salmond  in the second and final debate on independence.

Mr Salmond easily won the contest according to a snap poll for ICM. Some 71 per cent of voters said the SNP leader was the victor. Just 29 per cent thought Mr Darling had won the contest.

Today, a confident Mr Salmond challenged Mr Cameron to campaign against independence in Scotland.

It comes after Mr Salmond accused his debate rival Mr Darling of being the ‘front man for the Conservative Party’ in last night's debate.

He said: ‘Alistair Darling is in alliance with the Conservative Party in this campaign. That is what the No campaign is.

‘Let’s have the real leader of the No campaign, David Cameron. Let’s have him in Scotland now.

‘Let’s see if Mr Cameron is prepared to come to Scotland and have the debate.’

Last night's victory is a dramatic turnaround for Mr Salmond who was left flailing earlier this month after Mr Darling successfully challenged him over the economy and the future of the pound.

But last night Mr Salmond came armed with a number of currency options for an independent Scotland, but insisted keeping the pound was the best. Mr Darling meanwhile was left repeating his criticism that Mr Salmond had not offered a plan B if Westminster stopped Scotland using sterling.

A 'Yes' vote in Scotland on September 18 would trigger a political earthquake at Westminster – and could even force Mr Cameron to resign.

The Prime Minister has insisted he would not resign if Scotland voted for independence. But if Mr Salmond triumphs next month, there will immediately be pressure for him to go from within his own party.

Former Conservative leadership rival David Davis said a ‘Yes’ vote would be ‘particularly humiliating’ for Mr Cameron.

John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, added: "A Yes vote would destroy Cameron's place in the history books. He would become known as the prime minister who gambled on keeping Scotland in the union and lost his gamble.’

Despite the threat to his premiership, Mr Cameron’s spokeswoman indicated that the Prime Minister did not watched last night’s independence debate.

‘The Prime Minister watched news reports of the debate,’ said the spokeswoman.

Asked why Mr Cameron had missed a key moment in the independence battle, she said: ‘The key moment is when people go to vote on September 18.’

The PM only watched highlights of the first debate earlier this month, which was won by Mr Darling, and perhaps he was confident of another victory by the pro-union camp.

Following last night’s debate, Mr Darling admitted the battle to keep Scotland in the union would be fought ‘right down to the wire’.

But the former chancellor insisted he was ‘increasingly confident’ that Scots would vote against leaving the UK when they go to the polls in just over three weeks’ time.

Today, as he visited a factory in Inchinnan, Renfrewshire, Mr Darling said the No campaign had been ‘right to focus on currency’, adding: ‘One of the things that is striking in the last three weeks is the amount of people who have come up to me and said “What about this plan B?” is quite remarkable.’

When asked if changes would be made to the pro-UK campaign following last night’s debate, he insisted: ‘Absolutely not.’

Postal votes for the September 18 ballot are being sent out from today, and Mr Darling added that as the ‘finishing post’ comes into sight, Scots are increasingly focused on the decision to be made.

He said: ‘There’s a very clear choice here and I think people can see that, people are very focused now, especially as they can see the finishing post.

‘I’m increasingly confident we will win, but it is our job to win well and to win well we’ve got to carry on campaigning up untill 10pm on September 18.' 

Mr Salmond meanwhile told Sky News he had ‘argued persuasively’ on currency, setting out his position that it was ‘common sense for a common currency’.

He argued that the Yes campaign was winning ‘decisively’ on the key issues of protecting public services and creating jobs in Scotland.

The First Minister said: ‘He (Alistair Darling) had his chance and he muffed it last night. The currency bluff has been called. The Scottish people are calling that bluff.

‘The No campaign had their chance, their bluff has been called. People have, I think, overwhelmingly in Scotland now in poll after poll shown that we want to keep the pound. That is the decision that the Scottish people are being asked to make.' 

The Scottish First Minister went on the attack immediately in last night's debate - questioning what would happen to the NHS, welfare and oil under Tory rule from London after 2015.

Mr Salmond also claimed the former Labour Chancellor had made the ‘biggest revelation’ in the independence debate so far after he admitted Scotland could use the pound without the rest of the UK’s permission after independence.

But Mr Darling said this would leave Scotland at the mercy of a ‘foreign country’ telling it how much it could spend like Eurozone countries which have to get their budgets signed off in Brussels.

Mr Salmond also admitted for the first time that there were other options for Scotland than keeping the pound.

He said: ‘I'm looking for a mandate to share sterling in a currency union.’ But he added: ‘There are other options for Scotland.’

However Mr Darling said: ‘The thing about a currency union is both sides have to agree to it. We are talking about a huge risk if we assume it’s going to fall into line.

‘It’s not a matter for Alex Salmond what the alternative is. If it’s the Panama model I want to know. If it’s the Euro I don’t want that either. I want to know what plan B is.’

But after being pressed by Mr Salmond he admitted: ‘We could us the pound.’

Mr Salmond said: ‘Alistair admitted we could use the pound anyway. They cannot stop us using the pound – the most important revelation in this debate.’

The pair also clashed over North Sea oil and the NHS.

The SNP leader said every other country in Europe would give their ‘eye teeth’ for North Sea oil.

But Mr Darling said: ‘Once it’s gone it’s gone. What I don’t want to see is my country so dependent on something that is so volatile.’

He added: ‘He is asking us to take his word on everything. ‘We need answers to tonight, right here right now. Are we going to place all our bets on Alex Salmond alone being right?’

Mr Darling said: ‘This is a decision for which there is no turning back.’

But Mr Salmond said: ‘This is an extraordinary time for us all. The eyes of the world and, indeed, focus is on Scotland.’ He added: There is much far too much, far too much, that is still controlled in Westminster. We couldn't stop the bedroom tax, we couldn't stop illegal wars.’

He added: ‘Three weeks on Thursday we can take things back to Scottish hands. Absolutely no-one, non-one, can run the affairs of Scotland better than the people of Scotland.’

Mr Salmond added: ‘This is our time, it’s our moment, let us do it now.’
