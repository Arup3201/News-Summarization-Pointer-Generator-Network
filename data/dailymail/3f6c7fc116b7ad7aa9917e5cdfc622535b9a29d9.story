The famous Cadbury's Creme egg catchphrase is 'How do you eat yours?'. Well now you can try getting your mouth around a super-sized one.

This creme de la Creme Egg is just one of the colossal candy creations guaranteed to send any chocolate lover’s blood sugar levels soaring.

Featured on Pimp That Snack, a website set up by Pete Wilcock, 31, for sweet-toothed chocolate fiends to share their mammoth renditions of everyday favourite snacks, the egg contains a massive 1.5kg of sugar.

After making a few of his own designs, Pete, from Edinburgh, invited others to send in their own versions and was inundated with a wave of more calorie-laden giant snacks.

This creme de la Creme Egg is just one of the colossal candy creations that brings any chocolate lover's dream to life

The oversized egg is at least 5 times the size of the normal Easter chocolate treat

Containing a staggering 1.5kg of milk chocolate, 1.5kg of sugar, and two 140g bottles of liquid glucose, merely looking at this gooey creation can give you type 2 diabetes

As well as the giant Creme Egg complete with filling, creations include a scale-busting Snickers bar and a titanic Toblerone treat.

But with the giant egg alone containing a whopping 1.5kg of chocolate, 1.5kg of sugar, 2,140g bottles of liquid glucose, as well as vanilla extract and red and yellow colouring, they are unsurprisingly not kind on the waist line.

This Yorkie chocolate bar is neither for girls or boys - made of a whopping 1200g of chocolate

While data manager Pete loves nothing more than going wild in the kitchen, he admits he often has to call for back up when it comes to munching his way through the jaw-dropping confectionery.

Pete said: 'Sadly giant snacks are not a full time job although it’s been a very pleasant hobby for the last few years.

'Some snacks are the product of a single afternoon, while others can take days of preparation to get just right.

'For me, the single most impressive creation is the giant creme egg. It’s incredible.

'As the owner, I do have my own creations although I only really made the first few and the site took off like crazy and others starting sending in their own.

'Like any great effort, the reason for doing it is the satisfaction you get when you end up with something that looks authentic to the original, and gigantic too.

'The fact you usually have several kilograms of edible chocolate once you’re done is just a bonus you get to enjoy.'
