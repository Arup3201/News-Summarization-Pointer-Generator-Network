A convicted killer who escaped from an open prison was caught by police tonight after ten days on the run.

Alan Giles, 56, was imprisoned for life for the murder and kidnap of 16-year-old Kevin Ricketts in 1995, but had been moved to open conditions in HMP Hewell in Worcestershire as he was believed to be 'low risk'.

He walked out of the prison on Monday 28 October, prompting a huge police manhunt.

Officers from West Mercia Police were eventually able to apprehend the killer this evening after a member of the public called the police after spotting him in Alcester, Warwickshire.

Police officers poured into the area after the sighting, and Giles tried to run away, but was taken into custody.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Judge 
said: 'We are very pleased to have tracked down Mr Giles as the search 
for him has taken up an enormous amount of our time and resources over 
the past ten days.

'As 
we always suspected, a tip-off from a member of the public was key to us
bringing Mr Giles back into custody tonight and I'd like to take this 
opportunity to thank every single person who has come forward with 
information to help our investigation.

'We
have been really impressed by the amount of information that has come 
in and how keen people have been to help us with our inquiries.'

As part of the police manhunt, officers had been scouring the countryside, using police dogs and helicopters in a bid to track Giles down.

Members of the public were encouraged to call police with any information, but avoid approaching the killer if they saw him.

While Giles was on the run, it was revealed that he was regularly allowed into the local community to work at a Sue Ryder charity shop in Alcester, where he was eventually found.

However, his placement ended after Giles had a heated argument with another worker in the shop.

A whistleblower at HMP Hewell also alleged that wardens had recommended removing Giles from open conditions just five days before he absconded.

It was also claimed that he actually disappeared on Sunday night, rather than Monday morning as claimed by officers, and that nobody realised he had gone until the following day.

Police also warned the family of Giles's victim, Mr Ricketts, to stay at home during the hunt in case he was out for revenge.

Hannah Tyler, the 19-year-old neice of Kevin Ricketts, tweeted: ‘Had a few people asking about this so just to confirm yes the news about the escaped prisoner does involve my family.

‘He kidnapped and murdered my uncle and he’s out. He has been missing for over 24 hours now and people need to know. Please contact the police if you see him. My family’s safety is at risk.’

Giles was among the first men in Britain to be convicted of a murder despite there being no trace of his victim's body.

Mr Ricketts had failed to come home after a day at college in Brimingham in January 1995. Giles, who had recently split up with Kevin's older sister Elizabeth, quickly emerged as a suspect.

He was convicted of murder and kidnap at Brimingham Crown Court in 1997 after a witness, Carl Morris, revealed Giles had convinced him to help dispose of the boy's body.

Giles later confessed to police from his prison cell and told officers where to find the body.

Describing the incident, he told officers: 'I don't know whether I grabbed him with one hand or two hands. You just lose it. I probably grabbed him round the throat'
