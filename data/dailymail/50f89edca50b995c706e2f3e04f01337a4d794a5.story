Brendan Rodgers was joined by Liverpool legends Kenny Dalglish and Ian Rush in paying respects to the victims of the Boston bomb victims.

Rodgers laid a wreath on Boylston Street in memory of the lives lost in the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. The Reds manager was also joined by John Henry and Linda Pizzuti.

The Liverpool manager then got down to work as Liverpool trained at Harvard University.

It was the side’s first session since the Reds lost 1-0 to Roma on Wednesday night.

Daniel Agger’s late own-goal proved the difference on the night but Rodgers took plenty of positives from the game, not least the performance of Philippe Coutinho who laid down his case to fill the void left by Luis Suarez.

The only real concern for Rodgers came early on when Fabio Borini was forced out of the game with a shoulder injury.

The Liverpool player's were put through their paces, including goalkeeper Pepe Reina, whose future at Anfield is far from clear after his return from a loan spell at Napoli.

The Boston bomb disaster occurred on April 15th - the same day as the Hillsborough Disaster.
