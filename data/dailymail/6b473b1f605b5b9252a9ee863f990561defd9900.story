Dead: A former scandal-hit Florida tourism director, Mark Bellinger, has been found dead of a drugs overdose after leaving a suicide note

A tourism director has been found dead after an apparent drug overdose - just one day after being accused of using public funds sent by BP after the 2010 oil spill to buy a $747,000 home.

Mark Bellinger, 52, had also admitted just days earlier to using tax dollars to buy a $710,000 luxury yacht - which he had falsely claimed was going to be used for county tourism promotions.

Bellinger, from the Florida Panhandle, had gone missing on Thursday and was found on Friday morning in his car in Alabama. He died later in hospital, Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Ashley said.

The alarm had been raised by his wife after she found a suicide noted at their home on Thursday.

Bellinger was hired as tourism director of the area in May 2010, only weeks after the massive BP oil spill began in the Gulf of Mexico.

After admitting he had bought the yacht, Bellinger resigned on Tuesday and by Thursday the sheriff's office had issued an arrest warrant concerning the purchase of his $747,000 home.

The house, in the gated Kelly Plantation neighbourhood of Destin, Florida, boasts four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a swimming pool, a spa and a wine room, according to Zillow.com.

Property records show the home, which also overlooks a golf course, was bought last August.

The money is believed to have come from BP PLC, which paid restitution to communities across the Gulf Coast so they could lure valuable tourists back to the region devastated by tar.

Sheriff Ashley said the death would not end the investigation into the tourist council's spending.

'Even in light of this tragedy and death, we will still be working with the FBI, our white-collar crime task force and assisting the state auditor in conducting a forensic audit of all tourist development expenditures during Mr. Bellinger's tenure with the department,' he said.

'We will be determined to uncover everything dealing with tourist development, bed tax and BP oil money.'

Bellinger had worked in a similar role in Palm Springs, California before taking the job in Florida.

Okaloosa County leaders did not know a yacht had been bought until recently, when the vessel's title paperwork was delivered in the mail. Bellinger acknowledged he bought the yacht.

Meeting with county commissioners, he 
said he was trying to do his best for the county when he made the 
purchase, which he said hoped would be used promotional campaigns.

Luxury: He had also acknowledged buying a 44-foot, 2011 Marquis 420 SC yacht (like the one pictured) with $710,000 of tax dollars. He claimed it was going to be used for tourism promotions

But he admitted he should not have bought the yacht without prior approval. 'I did put the cart before the horse,' he said. 'It was a mistake in judgment on my part.'

Commissioners immediately announced they wanted to sell the boat, which was bought in December.

'It's an embarrassment to the county to have that titled in the county's name,' Commissioner Bill Roberts said.

The revelations sparked a call for an investigation from  state Senator Don Gaetz.

'The deeply troubling circumstances 
in Okaloosa County raise a larger question about the uses of BP funds by
others who have received these funds,' Gaetz wrote in a letter to Govenor Rick Scott.

The sheriff's office announced it would be conducting an investigation into the 'unorthodox and secretive... purchase with county bed tax monies' in a press release on Friday.

In September, tourism business leaders in the county held a breakfast to celebrate the region's recovery from the oil spill.

At the evenet Bellinger announced the county had record tourism levels for June and July, adding: 'It was just an unbelievable summer, and I don't know how we could top this off next year, folks.'
