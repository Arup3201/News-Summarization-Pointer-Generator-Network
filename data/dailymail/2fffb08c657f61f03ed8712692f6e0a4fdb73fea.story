The alleged ringleaders of one of Britain’s most notorious street crime gangs were arrested in a nationwide crackdown yesterday.

Up to 700 officers swooped on addresses from London to Edinburgh in co-ordinated dawn raids which were aimed at ‘decapitating’ their suspected underworld empire.

The operation targeted the GAS  – Guns and Shanks – gang which runs a multi-million pound crack cocaine ring and is linked to a string of murders. Senior officers said the gang, which has its roots in South London, was increasingly stretching its ‘tentacles’ to new markets in other cities, the Home Counties and affluent suburbs.

They warned that its leaders were 
willing to use extreme violence, often sparking bloody turf wars as they
 kicked out weaker rivals.

The GAS gang was behind at least six killings in recent years, many fuelled by tit-for-tat rows over territory and ‘respect’.

It
 was also responsible for the callous shooting that paralysed 
five-year-old Thusha Kamaleswaran as she played in her uncle’s shop in 
Stockwell, South London, in 2011.

Yesterday
 police teams swooped on more than 20 addresses thought to belong to the
 ‘top tier’ of the criminal network, described as ‘the most 
senior-ranking high-harm members’.

A
 total of 29 suspects, aged between 18 and 47, were arrested at 
properties in Edinburgh, Bedfordshire, Barking in East London, Reading 
and Bracknell in Berkshire. Raids also took place on estates controlled 
by the gang in Brixton and Stockwell, as well as across Lambeth, 
Southwark, Brent and Hackney.

Search teams recovered thousands of pounds in cash and a huge amount of crack cocaine –  the gang’s main source of income.

Scotland
 Yard, which was behind the operation, has enjoyed great success in 
targeting street gangs in recent years, recording substantial falls in 
associated crime.

But one top officer said in some cases their activities have simply been displaced to other areas, including the Home Counties.

Commander
 Steve Rodhouse said: ‘This particular gang have identified drug markets
 across the country which they see as fruitful and have moved into them.
 The money comes back to London – these are London gangsters – but we 
are willing to follow them wherever they go.’

The raids were the latest phase in the crackdown, which has racked

up a total of 88 arrests since it began in December.

The GAS gang, which some say also 
stands for Gangsters Always Shoot, has been blamed for eight out of ten 
murders and serious attacks on its South London home patch.

It
 recruits children young as 12, known as ‘youngers’, to run errands and 
sell drugs. Meanwhile senior members, known as ‘elders’, use extreme 
violence to enforce a hugely profitable drug-dealing network.

Police have monitored a worrying trend of young men from war zones, including Somalia, joining criminal street gangs.

Most
 recent shootings have been carried out using poor quality, converted 
starting pistols or antique guns, as police restrict the supply of   
firearms. But police fear the gang could have access to Mac-10 machine 
guns, dubbed ‘spray and pray’ for their high rate of fire and 
inaccuracy.

Commander Rodhouse added that police are monitoring a worrying trend in ‘aggravated burglaries’ where gang members threaten

people in their homes.

The
 Met said the suspects were arrested on suspicion of crimes including 
conspiracy to supply class A drugs, money laundering, fraud and 
immigration offences.
