A college fraternity has been suspended after throwing a 'Cripmas' party which flared up racial tensions on campus.

The party, held by Clemson University's Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity on Saturday, showed some white students throwing stereotypical gang symbols while dressed in bandannas, Tupac t-shirts and sporting fake 'thug' tattoos. The party was also reportedly attended by female students from several sororities.

Photos from party-going students at the South Carolina school flooded social media and were accompanied by comments such as: 'Merry Cripmas to all, and all a hood night.' 

Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at Clemson held a party on Saturday night where they threw stereotypical gang symbols and posted pictures on social media wishing a 'Merry Cripmas and to all a hood night'

The frat party was also attended by female students from sororities. Pictured are two students at the party with 'thug life' written on their knuckles

The party, organized by several SAE members, was held off-campus at a private residence. 

'Cripmas' appeared to be a reference to a primarily African-American gang, The Crips, founded in California.

Clemson students responded in fury to the images on social media, tagging them with #merrycripmas and organized a protest on Sunday morning on campus. 

A protesting student posted a picture online of a group of frat boys throwing gang symbols, one dressed in a T-shirt with '$18 thug' written on the front. She added the message: 'And this ladies and gentlemen, is Clemson University.'

However a few students appeared to defend the party, with one Clemson student tweeting: 'People have themed parties all the time, i.e. white trash? Why is everything getting turned into a race ordeal? Ridiculous. #ClemsonCripmas'

Clemson University said in a statement to MailOnline that SAE chapter members, their alumni advisory board and the national headquarters decided to suspend all activity indefinitely following the inappropriate theme party.

Several SAE members resigned from positions and have been suspended from the fraternity. An internal investigation is underway, the school said.

A number of pictures from the party appeared on social media with Clemson students flashing stereotypical gang signs and one wearing a T-shirt with '$18 Thug' written on the front 

Dozens of white students attended the off-campus party on Saturday with the gang theme which the university deemed inappropriate and condemned

Clemson University president, James Clements (right), speaks with students protesting the frat party which caused outrage for its perpetuation of stereotypes at a time of heightened racial tensions across the U.S.

Clemson University president, James Clements, sent an email to students on Sunday, making clear that the party was not sanctioned by the university and such events will not be tolerated. 

Mr Clements wrote: 'At a time of year when our thoughts are turning to family, holidays and the start of a new year – all the things that unite us and bring us joy -- it is discouraging that so many events and issues are causing division and hurt, and making many students feel unwanted at this great university. 

'It hurts to read disrespectful and just plain mean comments in social media. Last night’s ''Cripmas'' party, which the university did not sanction, raised more concerns about the campus climate. Clemson is better than this.

He added: 'Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion about events in Ferguson, Staten Island and the protest rallies that those events have spawned. Great universities are built on the free expression and exploration of ideas. But the free expression of opinion must not cross the line and become harassment or intimidation, just as rallies and protest marches must not cross the line to lawlessness.'
