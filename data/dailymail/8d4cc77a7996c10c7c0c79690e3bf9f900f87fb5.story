A British holidaymaker has captured a series of amazing photos that reveal the sheer power and brutality of a hungry leopard going after its prey.

Kevin Wilson’s snaps show terror in the face of the hapless springbok, which met an unfortunate end as it was taken down by the ruthless predator at an African game reserve.

In Kevin’s photos, the leopard sinks its teeth into the gazelle and clings on to its prey with its powerful paws while its whole body is lifted off the ground during the struggle at Etosha National Park in north-west Namibia.

Mr Wilson said the leopard took down its victim and completed the kill in some long grass less than 20 seconds after the attack began

In another frame, the big cat appears to be stood up on its hind legs like a human as it takes a commanding grip on the hind of the springbok.

The leopard then takes down its victim and completes the kill in some long grass less than 20 seconds after the attack began.

Afterwards, the leopard ambled over to the truck Kevin, 55, and his wife, Janet, were in and sat in the shade the vehicle offered.

Kevin, from Leatherhead, Surrey, said he was incredibly lucky to have captured the display on camera.

He and his wife were driving themselves around while in radio contact with two guides, who informed them about a leopard stalking prey near the Rietfontein waterhole.

He said: ‘We headed there straight away and saw the leopard hiding in the long grass on the hunt for three springboks nearby, but they spotted it and ran off.

‘All of a sudden another springbok appeared and it didn't see the leopard and actually headed straight for it.

‘We moved position and I had time to get my camera focused on the leopard. The springbok almost walked on top of the leopard which then sprung into action.'

Kevin added: ‘It immediately grabbed hold of its prey and swung on to it while the springbok tried to get away but in no time at all the leopard dragged it to the ground.

‘The whole thing took no more than 20 seconds. The sheer speed and power of the leopard was just breath-taking.

‘It was a fairly hot day and after it happened [the leopard] walked over to our car and sat in the shade and growled at us. We knew then it was time to make a move as we didn't want to be its next meal.’
