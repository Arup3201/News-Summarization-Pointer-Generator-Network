Dead: Kosara Mladenovic was accidentally declared dead by the Social Security Administration after her husband recently died

It wasn't a sad day when Vaso Pavlovic received a  letter at his New York home from the Social Security Administration offering condolences for the loss of his mother-in-law.

It was a confusing one. 

Confusing because his mother-in-law, Kosara Mladenovic, is very much still alive.

A keystroke error resulted in the agency declaring Mladenovic dead when it was her husband, Pavlovic's father-in-law, who recently passed away,CBS New York reports.

After declaring her dead, the administration reportedly cut off her monthly benefits, which the family uses to support Mladenovic, paying her nursing home expenses.

'They just killed a woman by putting a check sign next to her,' Pavlovic told CBS NY.

This kind of situation is not uncommon. CBS NY reports that about 14,000 people a year experience a situation similar to Pavlovic's.

However, although the situation is easy to get into, it is rather difficult to get out of.

Pavlovic said that to fix the administration's error, he has to prove his mother-in-law is alive. This is no simple task.

Pavlovic told CBS NY that in order to correct the mistake he must present a photo of Mladenovic holding newspapers with the day's date on them, he must present a statement from her nursing home confirming she is a tenant, he must present his father-in-law's death certificate as well as his obituary in the local newspaper.

Benefits: Vaso Pavlovic, Mladenovic's son-in-law, said the agency cut off Mladenovic's benefits which the family uses to support her

Elder care advocate Gideon Schein told CBS NY that mistakes like this are very difficult to correct.

'It is much harder to undo a keystroke mistake than it is to do it,” Schein said.

“It’s pretty complicated...social Security is our everything. If that gets somehow misused, we’re in terrible trouble, so they’re very careful and I do understand that.'

In a statement, the agency said that requiring proof of identification is a security measure to protect against potential fraud and identity theft. 

The agency told CBS NY that after hearing about Pavlovic's situation, the agency took immediate steps to correct the situation.
