It's been four years since fans watched Edie Britt, the vamp of the Desperate Housewives' original five, die from electrocution in the aftermath of a dramatic car crash.

And today, Nicollette Sheridan - the actress who played the pneumatic blonde - stormed out of court in an equally compelling fashion after discovering she was just a juror away from vindication in her wrongful termination suit brought against her former bosses... and a $6 million payout.

Judge Elizabeth Allen White declared a mistrial following days of a solidly hung jury, this means that the case will have to be brought to trial again if Nicollette Sheridan wants to pursue a verdict.

Dramatic exit: Nicollette was up and away after the verdict was delivered but her lawyer Mark Baute stayed behind to confirm that they will continue to fight at a re-trial

And well, she might, considering the position of the jury at mistrial.

They were hung 8-4 in favour of her version of events: that Edie was killed because Sheridan complained about series creator Marc Cherry's behaviour towards her.

Nicollette needed just one more juror to be convinced that this is what happened for a victory verdict, and those damages of just under $6 million.

She claimed that he'd given her a 'wallop' on the head during a rehearsal for a scene in 2008, he contended it was a 'tap' for direction as they worked on her character's responses.

It had seemed this argument was terminally wounded when this charge of battery against Cherry was dismissed early last week.

He was released as a defendant in the case but the issue of whether ABC and Cherry killed Edie off because of the complaint, regardless of the severity of the incident, still remained.

And the jury almost conclusively agreed with Sheridan's claims, despite Cherry and ABC bosses taking the stand over the past two weeks to insist this exit was months in the planning BEFORE this incident and subsequent complaint.

Much of the testimony focused on the 
timing of Cherry's decision to kill off Edie.

Ten witnesses said he made
it months before the on-set incident, but two writers for the show said
her fate was not sealed until after.

48-year-old Sheridan wanted at least $5.7 million from creator Marc Cherry and Touchstone Television Production.

The two-week trial offered jurors a behind-the-scenes look at the soap, which is to bow out this spring after eight seasons.

The testimony of more than a dozen writers, executives and producers was often unflattering.

There were tales of salary disputes and arguments over forgotten lines.

Sheridan said Cherry talked down to her, and he recalled her as rude, unpunctual and unprepared for rehearsals.

He also
recounted her fighting with co-star Teri Hatcher over forgotten lines 
and said two other stars, Felicity Huffman and Eva Longoria, were 
'relieved' when they learned she was leaving the show.

Vindicated... almost: Sheridan, who was smiling hopefully as she arrived at court in LA today with lawyer Mark Baute, had eight jurors behind her when a mistrial was recorded, she need one more to win

Battled it out: Nicollette said Cherry (right) 'walloped' her but this battery charge was dismissed meaning he was not at court for the last few days

The Desperate Houswives cast: Brenda Strong, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, Teri Hatcher and Nicollette

Big draw: Viewers loved tuning in to watch Edie Britt's antics on Desperate Housewives
