Seven people - who appear to be members of the same family - have been arrested in connection with the shootings of four Louisiana sheriff's deputies, including two who were killed.

Police have not released the motive behind the tragic slayings of family men Brandon Nielsen, 34, and Jeremy Triche, 27, who were shot dead in an early morning gun spree west of New Orleans on Thursday.

Two other officers - Michael Boyington, 33, and 30-year-old Jason Triche - suffered serious gunshot wounds but are recovering.

Three men and a woman - Derrick D. Smith, 22, Terry Lynn Smith, 44, Kyle David Joekel, 28, and 21-year-old Teniecha Teniel Bright - were today charged with principal to attempted first degree murder of a police officer.

Brian Lyn Smith, 24, was charged with attempted first degree murder of a police officer and Chanel Melissa Skains, 37, and Britney Keith, 23, were charged with accessory to attempted first degree murder of a police officer.

All seven were arrested in connection with the attempted murder of Boyington, who was the first deputy shot.

Charges have not yet been filed in connection with the two deputies who were killed or the second wounded deputy. Although, authorities said yesterday they do not believe any suspects are still at large.

'We don’t know precisely what happened 
yet,' said Ronnie Jones, an assistant to the state police 
superintendent. 'We’re still putting pieces together.'

One of the suspects was accused of making threatening comments about law officers in Nebraska recently.

The superintendent, Col. Mike Edmonson, said the case is complex, involving two different crime scenes, multiple weapons and numerous witnesses.

On Thursday, a tearful Sheriff 
Michael Tregre said the incident, which he described as an ambush, 
started when a gunman opened fire on Jason Triche who was working an 
off-duty traffic detail at a remote parking lot at the intersection of 
La. Highway 3217 and Airline Highway.

Tregre said 
someone phoned into the deputies with a description of a car fleeing the scene, 
and officers tracked it to the nearby Riverview trailer park.When
officers found the car, they handcuffed a suspect outside a trailer, 
then knocked on its door. Tregre said someone with a dog answered.

'Another
person exited that trailer with an assault weapon and ambushed my two 
officers,' Tregre said.

There, St. John the Baptist Parish deputies Nielsen, a father-of-five, and father-of-one Jeremy Triche were killed.

Edmonson said evidence and interviews so far place five of those arrested at the scene where Boyington was shot — the entrance of a parking lot used by contract workers on a job at a nearby oil refinery.

All seven suspects, from LaPlace, 25 miles west of New Orleans, are being held in custody with bonds ranging from $350,000 to $750,000, although Brian Lyn Smith and Joekel are being treated for gunshot wounds in hospital. They will be jailed once they are out of the hospital.

Sheriff Mike Tregre refused to discuss the criminal histories or possible motives of any of the suspects.

However, details on some suspects’ past were beginning to emerge.

The Gage County, Nebraska, Sheriff’s 
Office website listed Joekel among its most wanted fugitives, saying he 
is accused of making 'terroristic threats' to patrons of a Nebraska bar 
and law enforcement officials.

The sheriff’s office confirmed on the
website that Joekel has been arrested in Louisiana but said it would 
release no other details, referring calls to Louisiana authorities.

The same website also said Joekel is 
wanted in Kansas for felony flight to avoid arrest in connection with 
the Nebraska threats. The site said Joekel fled when Marshall County 
Sheriff’s Office deputies tried to stop the vehicle he was driving.

In DeSoto Parish in northern 
Louisiana, Sheriff Rodney Arbuckle said authorities were working to 
confirm whether some of the suspects arrested in Thursday's shootings 
had been among a group of people under surveillance for suspicious 
activity at an RV park in his area.

DeSoto deputies had started watching 
the RV park after three men and two women were seen getting in and out 
of vehicles with assault weapons.

Tregre did not have detailed conditions on the two wounded deputies, Boyington and Jason Triche. 
Jason Triche was somehow related to one of the slain men, Jeremy Triche.

However, he said both were recovering and gaining strength on Friday.

Triche, he said, 'couldn’t really 
speak but he could write,' and Boyington was well enough to joke that he
would be back at work on Monday.

A candlelight vigil for the slain 
officers was planned for tonight in front of the St. John the Baptist 
Parish government building where employees spent part of the day lined 
up in front of two mobile blood donation buses, part of a blood drive 
for the wounded officers.

The
initial shooting occurred around 5:30 a.m. at a parking lot off 
Louisiana Highway 3217 used by workers in the industrial area about 20 
miles west of New Orleans, near the line between St. Charles and St. 
John the Baptist parishes.

A massive grain port also is nearby. There is heavy traffic in the area as shifts change at plants and port facilities.

Bill
Day, spokesman for Valero Energy Corp., said one of the deputies was 
providing security for an off-site parking lot used by contractors 
working at the Valero St. Charles Refinery.

Day
said operations at the refinery had not been affected. Valero employees
were being asked to report to work as normal, unless they park at the 
lot where the incident took place.

Some
other plants in the area were letting non-essential workers in the area
leave for the day or were telling them not to report for work as the 
search continued.

St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff Mike Tregre talks to reporters near the crime scene where two sheriffs were killed and two wounded in an early morning shootout in St. John the Baptist Parish, west of New Orleans

Police officers from throughout metro New Orleans rushed to the scene after the shootings in anticipation of a possible manhunt.

Tregre said an active search for suspects was no longer under way. State police are taking over the investigation.

Tregre, a longtime employee of the St. John sheriff's office who took 
over as sheriff just 45 days ago, struggled to contain his emotions as 
he delivered the news to reporters shortly after 9 am on Thursday.

'This is a very 
difficult day,' he said. 'I lost two good men.' He asked the public to 
pray for Boyington and Triche to recover.

Gov.
Bobby Jindal ordered the state flags to be flown at half-staff over the
state capitol and all public buildings and institutions until sunset 
Friday. The move, described as 'an expression of respect for the four 
sheriff's deputies,' was effective immediately, the governor's order 
said.
