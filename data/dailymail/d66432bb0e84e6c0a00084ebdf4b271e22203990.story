A husband is believed to have killed his estranged wife, their teenage daughter and his brother-in-law before killing himself in a horrific murder-suicide which rocked a Phoenix suburb yesterday.

Officers found Carol Sanders' burned body in the home's back yard after responding to neighbors reports of gunfire.

Inside the home they discovered the couple's 14-year-old daughter Audra who had also been shot dead.

Carol's brother Tom Fitzpatrick, 49, was found shot in his vehicle outside while Michael Sanders, 51, killed himself in a nearby alley.

Murder-suicide: Carol and Audra Sanders were killed at the family home alongside Carol's brother Tom Fitzpatrick

Police said the couple had separated and Carol was collecting her belongings from the family home when her husband attacked.

The shooting came just hours after they appeared in a Maricopa County Courtroom over a protective order Carol Sanders, 51, had taken out against Michael.

Divorce: Police say Carol Sanders filed for divorce from Michael last month

She reportedly filed for divorce last month and had moved out with her daughter some time before, AZFamily reported.

'I understand he had an order of protection put out against him, and it may very well be related to that,' Sgt. Trent Crump, a spokesman for Phoenix police, told the website.

'It certainly is a chilling case .... We believe it was planned out. He left his identification in his vehicle.'

'We understand, by witness accounts, that he first shot the brother seated in his truck in the front driveway.

'He then went into the home were 
additional gunshots were heard. We believe that was the daughter and the
mother. Ultimately, we believe he took his wife out back and set her 
body on fire. It certainly is a horrific scene.'

Tributes flooded in for Audra, an eighth grade student at Desert Shadows Middle School. 

She was described as a good student and a popular member of the school choir.

'Everyone is devastated, we just really are,' said Kim Cooper, a parent at the school told AZFamily.

'Audra was just a bright, bright girl...neat personality, interesting, her teachers loved her.'

A
statement from Paradise Valley Unified School District read: 'We are 
heartbroken over the loss of our student, a 14-year-old child, and her 
family.

'The nature of their deaths is 
particularly difficult to accept. Audra Sanders was in the 8th grade and
was a member of the school chorus.

The
principal of Desert Shadows Middle School visited Audra's classes this 
morning to inform her classmates and to share with them that a team of 
adults is available to them if they need assistance processing their 
thoughts and feelings.'

'We will have counseling and support personnel at the school in the days ahead, as long as it appears they are needed.'

Friends said her father was extremely protective of his only child.
