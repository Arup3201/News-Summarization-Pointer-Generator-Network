Nemanja Matic is not the only player prone to violent reaction after being hit by a bad tackle, as this video of QPR midfielder Sandro proves.

The Brazilian midfielder has not featured for relegation-threatened Rangers since suffering a knee injury on November 19, and has been easing his way back towards full fitness.

But Sandro's return from injury took a dramatic twist when he was sent off for violent conduct while playing for QPR's Under 21 side on Monday.

With clear echoes of Matic's sending off for Chelsea against Burnley on Saturday, Sandro earned himself a red card for retaliating to a bad tackle on him towards the end of the game against Bristol City.

Matic was the victim of a studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes, and the Serbian midfiedler furiously raced after his assailant, shoving the Burnley striker to the floor. Referee Martin Atkinson failed to show Barnes a red or even a yellow card, while Matic was sent off, much to Jose Mourinho's disgust.

Sandro also found himself on the wrong end of a nasty challenge during injury time in QPR's 3-1 victory. Cutting in from the right touchline, the 25-year-old former Tottenham star was felled by a reckless lunge from 17-year-old Jake Andrews.

Perhaps with the pain of his recent injury still fresh on his mind, Sandro leapt to his feet and ran back towards the tackler before violently shoving him to the ground. As his opponent tried to get to his feet, Sandro grabbed him by the collar and again furiously shoved the City youngster. Unsurprisingly, he was quickly shown a red card.

The incident came just two days after QPR captain Joey Barton had set a dreadful example to his squad by receiving his marching orders for a below-the-belt punch at Hull's Tom Huddlestone.

Spurs sold Sandro to QPR at the end of last season following a public falling-out with then boss Tim Sherwood.

Hailed as a key signing by Harry Redknapp, he has been limited to just nine appearances due to injury. Redknapp has since left the club due to health reasons with Chris Ramsey taking over the club's fight against the drop until the end of the season.

But Sandro will not feature in too many more QPR games unless he learns to control his temper. Matic, who will miss the Capital One Cup final after his own red card, is also finding that out the hard way.
