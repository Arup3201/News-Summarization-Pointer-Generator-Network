This young Pied Cormorant wasn't in the mood to wait for dinner so instead stuck its head down its mother's gaping mouth to find something to eat.

The mother bird had already tucked into her tea but the ravenous offspring also wanted a bite.

These photographs were taken by Australian photographer Ofer Levy, 51, after he spotted the hungry bird in Centennial Park, Sydney.Â 

Dinner for two? The mother bird enjoys her fishy dinner while her offspring looks on

Starving: The hungry Pied Cormorant dives straight down its mother's throat looking for food

Mr Levy said: 'Here you can see a young Pied Cormorant trying to get partially digested fish from the parent's crop.

'It's pretty aggressive behaviour as the youngsters push their heads all the way down the parent's throat.

'They chase the adult bird and compete with each other to get to the food, so it's a pretty crazy moment to watch.'

Pied Cormorant's are found off the coast of Australia and New Zealand and will dive for food in both shallow, still water and rapidly moving currents to get their meal.

Famished: The young bird didn't want to wait around for dinner so had a quick look to see if its mother had any grub inside her

Taking a couple of weeks to get the perfect shot, Mr Levy said it was difficult to capture the feeding scene.

'It took me a lot of patience and persistence before I managed to capture this behaviour in front of me in the right distance and angle.

'I had to get in the pond with water up to my waist, but it was worth it to be able to get these pictures.

'It usually takes people a little while to look at my photographs before they actually realise what's going on, and that one bird's head is right down the other's throat.'
