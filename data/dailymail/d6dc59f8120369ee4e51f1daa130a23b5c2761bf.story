One of the last surviving Doolittle Raiders who attacked Japan during a daring World War II mission credited with boosting American morale, has died.

Lt. Col. Edward Saylor was a young flight engineer-gunner when he volunteered for the dangerous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo on April 28, 1942.

Led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, the mission saw 80 airmen sent in B-25 bombers from a carrier at sea to attack military targets in Japan. Without enough fuel to reach a safe landing point, the brave crew had to land in China and hope villagers would lead them to safety.

'It was what you do ... over time, we've been told what effect our raid had on the war and the morale of the people,' Saylor told The Associated Press in a 2013 interview.

Son Rod Saylor said his father died of natural causes aged 94 on Wednesday in Sumner, Washington.

Tom Casey, a manager for the Doolittle Raiders, said  that, despite the risks, 'they all volunteered to go anyway.' 'He did something very famous,'he added. 

The 16 B-25 bombers, each carrying five men, dropped bombs on targets such as factory areas and military installations and headed to designated airfields in mainland China realizing that they would run out of fuel, according to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force.

In 2013, retired Lt. Col Saylor joined fellow survivors of the history-making World War II Doolittle Raid retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole and David Thatcher at a Florida Air Force base for a final public reunion

Three crew members died as Raiders bailed out or crash-landed their planes in China, but most were helped to safety by Chinese villagers and soldiers. Of the eight Raiders captured by Japanese soldiers, three were executed and another died in captivity.

Saylor told the AP in 2013 that he was one of the lucky ones. 'There were a whole bunch of guys in World War II; a lot of people didn't come back,' he said.

The brave crewman grew up on a ranch in Brusett, Montana, and enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1939. He was just 22 when he volunteered for the Doolittle Raid and went onto serve in the Air Force for 28 years before retiring as a lieutenant colonel.

'At the time of the raid, you know the war was on and it was just a mission we went on, we were lucky enough to survive it but it didn't seem like that big of a deal at the time,' Saylor said in 2013.

'I spent the rest of the war in Europe and with the guys in Normandy and taking bodies out of airplanes and stuff and I didn't feel like a hero.

'My reaction when I out found out we were bombing Japan from an aircraft carrier was that it was too far to swim back home so we might as well go ahead with it,' he said. 'I never learned how to swim.'I was raised on a cattle ranch out in Montana.'

In 2013, retired Lt. Col Saylor joined fellow survivors of the history-making World War II Doolittle Raid retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole and David Thatcher at a Florida Air Force base for a final public reunion. The fourth surviving raider, Robert Hite, could not make the event.

They decided to meet at Eglin base because it is where they trained for their top-secret mission in the winter of 1942, just weeks after the Japanese devastated the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. 

'I didn't expect to survive. We should have been shot down,' said Saylor. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter maintenance hangar at Elgin base was named in his honor.

The Raiders also received the Congressional Gold Medal for heroism and valor and would still toast their fallen comrades each year using silver goblets which have the name of each raider inscribed. 

The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, B-25B Mitchell medium bomber launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific

The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on 18 April 1942, was an air raid by the United States during World War II. 

The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, caused negligible material damage to Japan, but helped to boost a wounded nation's morale in the aftermath of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. 

US Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers, with five crewmen on each were launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. 

The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, took off from the aircraft carrier on less than 500 feet of runway. They had only enough fuel to drop their bombs on military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety. 

Pilots volunteered and trained in Florida for what they only knew was 'extremely hazardous.'

Navigator Griffin, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, got top-secret briefings with pilot David Jones in Washington, just five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. 

Once at sea, the rest learned targets - factories, plants, military facilities on mainland Japan.

They knew the uncertainties: what if the Navy task force was attacked? What defences would they face? And with B-25s unable to land on a carrier decks, could they reach friendly bases in China? 

The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, would fly over military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety

The Raiders brushed aside Doolittle's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw. 

After encountering Japanese patrols, the raid launched ahead of plan, some 200 miles farther from shore for fuel-stretched bombers. Doolittle's plane took off first at 08:20 from a pitching carrier deck. 

They flew low in radio silence, skimming seas and then treetops. Cole recalls the country song 'Wabash Cannonball' running through his head. He tapped his foot in time until Doolittle shot him a questioning look. 

They were greeted by anti-aircraft guns and puffs of black smoke. Flak shook planes.

When they arrived at the target, Col. Doolittle ordered to open up the bomb bay doors. The bombs dropped, and the raiders 'got the heck out of there.'

The danger was just beginning. All 16 planes lacked enough fuel to reach bases and either crash-landed or ditched in dark, rough weather along China's coast south of Shanghai. 

They narrowly stayed ahead of Japanese searchers, who killed villagers suspected of helping the Americans. 

Eight Raiders were captured, and three executed. A fourth died in captivity. Three had died off the coast of China. 

In the end, fourteen crews, except for one crewman, returned either to the United States or to American forces.
