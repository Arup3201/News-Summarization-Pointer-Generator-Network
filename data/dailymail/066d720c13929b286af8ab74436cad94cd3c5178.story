A schoolgirl seduced by a RE teacher who had sex with her in a classroom cupboard spoke out for the first time today to hit back at the judge who accused her of 'grooming' him.

The teenager was 16 when married Stuart Kerner, 44, took her virginity on a yoga mat at school having brought condoms with him to Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London.

Kerner, who first targeted her when she helped him sort RE books in the library, took the girl to his marital home to have sex  in the same week his wife miscarried.

Yet Judge Joanna Greenberg QC gave him an 18-month suspended sentence because she suggested his victim  ‘groomed’ him and he ‘gave in to temptation’.

Speaking out: The victim of RE teacher Stuart Kerner - pictured outside court with his wife Katherine - has blasted the judge who said the 16-year-old 'groomed' him when he took her virginity in a store cupboard

The student, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said today that the judge's comments felt like being 'kicked in the stomach' because she was being unfairly branded a sexual 'predator'.

She told The Sun: 'How did I seduce him? I didn't pounce on him. He was the teacher. He groomed me. He arranged the time and places that we would meet.

'People will picture me wearing skirts and dolled up with make-up but I'm a plain Jane. I wish the trial had never gone ahead. I regret it more than the affair.'

A jury in December convicted Kerner of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust. He was cleared of four other similar charges.

The girl he had sex with said his lawyers claimed she invented a fantasy relationship based on Fifty Shades of Grey, in which a more experienced man has an affair with a younger woman.

Comments: Judge Joanna Greenberg QC provoked anger by saying Kerner 'gave in to temptation'

But she said that Kerner was obsessed with the erotic novel - buying her a Fifty Shades-themed keyring for Christmas which included a blindfold and mask. The jury sided with her.

In her first interview since his conviction she said she first met him when she was 14 and developed a crush on him. She said: 'My friends fancied Justin Bieber. I fancied Mr Kerner'. 

Describing how she was seduced she said she would often help him in the school library, but when they were alone he would put his hand on her leg. They first kissed when she was 15, she said.

'For months' they kept meeting in cupboard and empty rooms to kiss, she said, and then their relationship became sexual.

She said: 'I had never done anything with any boy before that' and then within weeks they planned to have sex when he 'told me that he would check both of our timetables and see when we could do it'.

She said Kerner had been carrying contraceptives with him at school 'for months' and also told her that he had made his wife pregnant but still had sex with the girl. 

Later he also had sex with her in the guest bedroom at the family home and his trial  heard he made her Marmite on toast and they watched Bargain Hunt between sessions.

But the girl's step-mother discovered what had happened and reported Kerner to police against her wishes.

The stepmother of the girl, who is now 19, told the Mail: 'He's the one who's committed the crime, and yet she's the one who was treated like a criminal in that courtroom. 

'He was in the position of trust and he was the responsible adult. How could it be her fault? How can you blame a 16-year-old schoolgirl? We're all still in shock.

'The teacher slept with her, then called her a s*** and he's been allowed to get away with it.'

The two-week trial heard that Kerner (pictured outside court) had carried around a condom for a week

In police interviews the girl described what had happened since she was 14, only to learn that Kerner had denied it all.

She said: 'It hurt me because he was a massive part of my life, I lost my virginity to him. He was like my first boyfriend. The first person I had kissed. For him to deny it was really painful.' 

The student was then dragged into court to give evidence in Kerner's trial, which led to his conviction. 

Judge Greenberg prompted fury from victims' groups after she gave Kerner, whose wife Katherine stood by him, an 18-month suspended sentence at Inner London Crown Court last month.

She told him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her... It was she who groomed you and you gave in to temptation.'

The Judicial Conduct and Investigations Office said it was considering misconduct allegations against the judge after it received 'multiple complaints'.

If a complaint is upheld, it can result in a judge being disciplined, suspended or removed from office entirely.

After his sentence it emerged Kerner's lawyers had formally lodged an appeal to overturn his conviction and clear his name. 

His solicitor Gary Rubin said: 'Not only is he planning to appeal, we actually lodged the appeal with the Court of Appeal well before Christmas.

'It was the advice given to his legal advisors that he should lodge an appeal against conviction. I lodged it within 14 days of his conviction.'
