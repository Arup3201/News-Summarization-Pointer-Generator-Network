Cunning plan: Tonia Dolison, 46, pictured, not only enjoyed dinner on a 62-year-old man she met online, but stole a blank check from his house and used it to pay her rent, police say

It was theft at first sight for one New Jersey woman last month.

Tonia Dolison, 46, not only enjoyed dinner on a 62-year-old man she met online, but stole a blank check from his house and used it to pay her rent, police say.

The woman, from New Jersey, has been charged with third and forth-degree grand larceny, second-degree forgery and second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument after the November 15 incident.

According to police, Dolison met her victim on a dating website and the two arranged to meet at a restaurant for their first date.

The date went so well that after dinner, Dolison agreed to go back to the man's Staten Island home for drinks, movies and to stay the night.

But while she was there, she swiped a check from a checkbook sitting on a table, she later admitted to detectives.

As soon as he took her home, she struck, allegedly writing a check to pay $4,000 in back rent.

Police say the theft took place at about 2 a.m. November 15, according to the Staten Island Advance.

According to court papers, Dolison confessed to the crime, saying she did it because she was about to be evicted.

'I noticed he had a blank check on the table so I just grab the first check from the book,' she reportedly told police.

'I then made the check out to my landlord and gave it to him. I did it because I was about to be locked out of the apartment. I signed and made out the check.'

It's unclear whether the victim asked her for a second date.
