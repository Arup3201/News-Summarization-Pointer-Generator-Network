A baby born a week before the legal abortion limit has defied expectations to battle back from the brink of death and make a miracle recovery.

Safari Hutchinson was born just 23 weeks into his mother’s pregnancy - weighing just over 600g - just over half a regular bag of sugar.

Doctors battled to save his life, and were forced to break his ribs as they gave him CPR seconds after birth in a bid to keep his tiny heart beating.

Safari Hutchinson was born just 23 weeks into his mother Nadine Osbourne's pregnancy. People can legally have an abortion until they reach the 24th week of pregnancy

But now, six months after he was born, he has finally been able to go home with mum Nadine Osbourne, and dad Aubin Hutchinson, both 31.

Ms Osbourne, from West Bridgeford, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I had already suffered a miscarriage at 19 weeks in a previous pregnancy, so when I went into labour at 23 weeks, I feared the worst.

'After he was born, the doctors said they didn’t know whether he would survive. I went from being on the world’s biggest high to the world’s biggest low.

'It was a fight for his life. I was losing a lot of blood too, but I didn’t care about me, I could only focus on him.

'But he came through it - it’s a miracle. He is so strong and I’m so so proud of him. I wasn’t allowed to hold him for five weeks, which was heart-breaking but I understood.

'We’re so happy just to have him home.'

When he was born, Safari weighed just over 600g - just over half a regular bag of sugar. Doctors had to perform CPR to save his life. In the process, a number of his ribs were broken

Nadine tragically miscarried in 2008 after a 19-week pregnancy, but was overjoyed when she and Aubin found out they were expecting a baby boy, last August.

However, her pregnancy this time only lasted 23 weeks and five days. The latest an abortion can be carried out in the UK is 24 weeks - two days after Safari was born.

Shortly after his birth, Safari had to have a life-saving operation to close a valve near his heart.

He was was transferred from Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham to Glenfield Hospital, Leiceister, for the high-risk operation, which left his blood pressure severely low.

However, Ms Osbourne says she is now ecstatic about her son’s miraculous recovery.

She said: 'He’s absolutely wonderful now. We can’t believe it. He’s showing all the signs of a happy and healthy baby.

'He’s awake every three or four hours, because he needs feeding - but that’s a good sign.

'I’d thought about the name anyway while I pregnant. Safari means to "go on a journey" and that’s exactly what’s happened. It’s been emotional.

'It all happened so quickly once he was born. I had to have steroids before I gave birth to help with a problem with his lungs.

Ms Osbourne first conceived in 2008 but she had a miscarriage when she was 19 weeks pregnant. When she went into labour with Safari, she feared that she would lose him too

'Once I hugged him, it was amazing. I was over the moon and took pictures and sent them to everyone.

'He had a ventilator in his throat which got dislodged and he nearly died because he stopped breathing. The doctors had to give him CPR and I went from the biggest high ever to rock-bottom.

'He had to have an operation too when they discovered he had a murmur after three days. He wasn’t getting enough blood to his kidneys and we were all so worried for him.

'The doctors said he might not survive. A premature baby’s blood pressure is supposed to be above 35. Doctors worry between 20-30, and his got to as low as 13.

'He’s been on a journey - I’m so happy and so proud.'

Grandma Beverley Osbourne, 55, said: 'I remember that day when he nearly died.

Six months after his birth, Safari has now been allowed to go home. His mother says he is showing every sign of being a happy and healthy baby

'I got to the hospital after I saw the photo of Nadine giving him a cuddle, and at that point I was so happy.

'But it got worse quickly. The sister of the ward said to me, once they saved him, "that was close".

'But he’s gorgeous now. I know every grandma will say that about their own grandchild, but it’s true.

'We all pulled together as a family, and that helped. A pastor came to say prayers and our prayers were answered.'

Dr Stephen Wardle who treated Safari said: 'We are doing something right.

'We are one of the biggest trusts in the region but statistically premature babies are more likelyto survive here in Nottingham than any other hospital in the region.'
