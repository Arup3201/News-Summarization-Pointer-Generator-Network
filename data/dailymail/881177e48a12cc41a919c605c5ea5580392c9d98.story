Mourners continued to leave floral tributes and poignant messages to murdered soldier Lee Rigby at the scene of his death today.

Members of the public young and old braved the rain to add to the growing carpet of flowers, teddy bears, poems left at 
the spot where the father-of-one was hacked to death in Woolwich last week.

Some of the tributes came from veterans, fellow servicemen and women and their families.

But an overwhelming number have been left by total strangers with no connection to the military who wanted to express their shock and sadness at his death and give sympathy to his family.

One message left today read: 'God be with you, Lee. You did not deserve this. You were defenceless. You did not deserve this. RIP.'

Meanwhile, a town in County Durham stood still this morning as army veterans held a memorial service for Drummer Rigby.

The service, led by the Sedgefield Veterans, took place outside St Edmunds Church where a flag was lowered to half mast.

The group holds a service for every serving solider who dies on duty.

In
stark contrast, war memorials defaced with Islamic slogans were being 
cleaned up today with the veterans’ charity footing the bill.

The
two monuments were targeted in London as police forces across the 
country dealt with a spate of ugly attacks fuelled by hatred after Drummer Rigby’s murder.

The
newly erected tribute to the bomber pilots of World War II was one of 
two central London war memorials defaced by vandals on Monday. The other
was the Animals in War memorial.

The name of murdered soldier Lee Rigby will be inscribed on a national memorial honouring Britain’s fallen servicemen and women.

Trustees for the Armed Forces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire, said Drummer Rigby’s name would be included as he had died in a terrorist attack.

In a statement, the memorial trustees said: 'Lee Rigby was killed as a result of terrorist action outside Woolwich Barracks in London on May 22 and qualifies for inclusion on the Armed Forces Memorial.

The memorial honours all members of the UK’s armed forces who have died in conflicts or as a result of terrorist attacks since the end of the Second World War.

Over
the Bank Holiday weekend, Drummer Rigby's widow made a tearful 
pilgrimage to the scene of his death the day after his fiancee made the 
same heartbreaking trip.

Rebecca Rigby, the mother of the 
soldier’s two-year-old son Jack, laid a wreath amid hundreds of other 
floral tributes to her estranged husband.

She
wrote on the card: ‘My hero, my soldier, my one true love. Until we 
meet again my angel I know you’ll be watching over me and Jack. Love 
always xxx.’

Another card tucked inside the wreath read: ‘For my daddy.’

Mrs
Rigby, 30, sobbed and cradled a pink Peppa Pig soft toy as she pinned a
balloon with the words ‘Dad in a million’ close to the spot in Woolwich
where 25-year-old Drummer Rigby was butchered by two Islamic fanatics 
on Wednesday.

Drummer
Rigby had survived Taliban bombs and bullets during a tour of duty as a
machine gunner in Afghanistan, only to be slaughtered on the streets of
London.

It is understood that he had separated from his wife, and started a relationship with army colleague Aimee West.

Miss West, 22, was flown back from Helmand where she was serving with the Royal Military Police.

On Saturday, she wept as she set down a bouquet of roses at the scene of his murder.
