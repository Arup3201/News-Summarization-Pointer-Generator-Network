Denial: Lynne Margulies, 56, said she watched the Taxi star die aged 35 in a Hollywood hospital

A former girlfriend of Andy Kaufman has insisted the comedy star is most certainly dead because she was in the room when he died from a rare form of lung cancer in 1984.

Lynne Margulies, 56, said she watched the Taxi star die aged 35 in a Hollywood hospital and that the woman claiming to be his daughter is a fake.

'I was in the hospital room. I was there. They would have had to switch bodies,' she told TMZ.

Ms Margulies said the 24-year-old 
woman who claimed she was Kaufman's daughter is a hoax.

She said she 
knows Kaufman's real daughter Maria who is in her forties and that he 
has no other children.

The website also posted a photo of the actor's official L.A. County death record, which lists his date of death as May 16, 1984.

On Monday Kaufman’s brother told a New York comedy club crowd 
that the famed comedian known for having an obsession with faking his 
own death could still be alive.

Then a woman claiming to be Kaufman’s 
daughter took the stage and claimed it is true.

Though
the world mourned the star’s death in 1984, 
Michael Kaufman told attendees at the 9th Annual Andy Kaufman Awards 
that he subsequently found elaborate plans his brother had for 
pulling off his greatest, and final, public stunt.

The
unnamed woman’s very believable tale of being raised by Kaufman in 
obscurity had the audience and conspiracy-loving internet abuzz, but it 
has now been revealed as a hoax and the woman a hired actress.

Shocker: A woman took the stage at the 9th Annual Andy Kaufman Awards in New York claiming to Kaufman's brother Michael (right) that she was the late actor's daughter and that he is still alive, living in obscurity

The Smoking Gun reports that Michael 
Kaufman met the actress, Alexandra Tatarsky, at an 
exhibition of memorabilia of his brother earlier this year and enlisted 
her to carry on a tradition that Kaufman himself began.

Michael
Kaufman first primed the audience with a recounting of how he, 
following his brother’s death, uncovered the comedian’s plans to stage 
his death.

Michael said
the plans contained instructions to meet Andy at a restaurant on 
Christmas Eve 1999. Michael claimed he did this and was handed a letter 
that detailed Andy’s decision to leave the spotlight and live an average
life.

Then a mysterious woman took the stage from the audience and her story seemed to match Michael’s tale very well.

Mastermind? Kaufman's brother Michael helped laid out the bait for the audience before Tatarsky--who he recruited--did her act

She said Andy had become a stay at home dad after meeting her mother and becoming a father but that he watched the annual awards show dedicated to his memory very closely.

Michael
Kaufman appeared shocked and confused by the incident. He asked the 
audience if they believed the woman then escorted her offstage and told 
attendees to respect her privacy.

Years of worth of conspiracy theories about the performance artist suddenly seemed proven as fact.

Even audience members who knew that the woman was a student of theater in New York bought the act.

Life's dream? The funnyman was notorious for his elaborate stunts, such as his stint as a 'lady' wrestler (left). Kaufman was also well known to be obsessed with the idea of staging his own death

'Tonight was a mindf***': Performer and one of this year's Andy Kaufman Awards finalists Killy Mockstar Dwyer took to Facebook to share her shock over the night's revelations

A finalist for the awards took to Facebook to convey the shock of the night’s revelations.

‘Anyone who was there will attest,’ comedian Killy Mockstar Dwyer wrote following the show. ‘Andy Kaufman's daughter came onstage and claimed he was alive. It was. It was...I can't tell you how it was, only that it was as real as any reality that i've seen.’

But, as it turns out, even fellow actors can be taken in by actors.

The Smoking Gun reported Tatarsky’s true identity on Thursday and revealed that her real father, whose name happens to be Andrew, is a New York City therapist specializing in addiction treatment.

Tough truth: The Taxi actor died after a battle with lung cancer in 1984 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. He had only one daughter, a woman named Maria Colonna who was born in 1969 and lives in Upstate New York
