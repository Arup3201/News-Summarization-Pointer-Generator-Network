A man who wore a T-shirt with offensive comments about the murders of Pc Fiona Bone and Pc Nicola Hughes on it just hours after they died has been sentenced to eight months in prison.

Barry Thew, 39, who has a lengthy criminal record, wore a T-shirt with ‘One less pig: Perfect justice’ hand-written on it the same day the two women police officers were gunned down.

Thew, of Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, admitted a Section 4A Public Order Offence (displaying writing or other visible representation with intention of causing harassment, alarm or distress) and was sentenced at Minshull Street Crown Court today.

Offensive: Thew in the hand-written T-shirt, which reads 'One less pig. Perfect justice'. He was arrested in Radcliffe town centre

Raw: Just hours after the death of the two officers, Thew wore this T-Shirt saying 'Kill a cop for fun.co.uk. Ha, haaa' in the town centre. He will serve eight months in prison

He was jailed for four months and ordered to serve another four months, consecutively, after he 
admitted breaching a suspended sentence order imposed for an earlier 
offence of cannabis production.

The sentence, at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, means he was jailed for a total of eight months. He will likely serve only half of that in custody.

At about 2.15pm on Tuesday 18 September, less than three-and-a-half hours after police officers Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone were shot dead, Thew was seen wearing the offensive T-shirt in Radcliffe town centre.

He was arrested and taken into custody.

Thew, who has 29 sets of previous convictions for 77 offences since 1983, appeared shaken as he was led away from the dock to serve his sentence.

Judge Peter Lakin delivered long and damning sentencing remarks.

He said the deaths of Pc Bone and Pc Hughes had left their families distraught and caused upset to 'every level' of Greater Manchester Police and to the public as a whole.

He said: 'This, on any view, is a shocking case. Your response to the shocking events was to parade around in a T-shirt in the centre of Radcliffe which had on it the most disgusting of slogans.

'In my judgement, it is utterly depressing that you felt able to stoop so low as to behave in that way.

'Your mindless behaviour has added to the pain of everyone touched by the death of these young officers. You have shown no remorse.'

The court heard Thew, from Radcliffe, said 'not bothered' when he was arrested after reports from outraged members of the public.

Judge Lakin added: 'It is aggravated by the fact that at the time you were made the subject of a suspended sentence. You are a man with a lengthy antecedent record.

'Whatever thoughts you may have about the police, or whatever personal animosity, gave you no excuse to behave in the way that you did.

'I hope that this sentence gives you time to reflect on the appalling way in which you behaved.'

The judge, who viewed photographs of the T-shirt, later ordered that it should be destroyed.

Stuart Duke, defending, said Thew had been an in-patient at a mental health unit and was still in prescription of anti-psychotic medicine, but Judge Lakin said his mental health was 'not a contributing factor'.

Mr Duke said Thew has a long-standing dispute with Greater Manchester Police over the death of his son three years ago and repeated 'stop and search' procedures.

He said: 'The wearing of this T-shirt was not in response to the deaths of the two police officers but it was another case.

'It is an on-going dispute between Mr Thew and Greater Manchester Police. He feels victimised and picked on.

'He did not go home when he heard the news. He was already wearing the T-shirt. He accepts that he is guilty by reason of his plea.'

Inspector Bryn Williams, of the 
Radcliffe Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: 'While officers on the 
ground were just learning of and trying to come to terms with the 
devastating news that two colleagues had been murdered, Thew thought 
nothing of going out in public with a t-shirt daubed with appalling 
hand-written comments on.'

He added: 'Thankfully the overwhelming response from the public - who have inundated us with messages of support and condolence - prove that Thew is the exception and not the rule and our communities were right behind us at our darkest hour.

'To mock or joke about the tragic events of that morning is morally reprehensible and Thew has rightly been convicted and sentenced for his actions.

PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, were killed on duty in a gun and grenade attack after they responded to a routine call about reports of a burglary at an address in Abbey Gardens.

Thousands lined city centre streets for their funerals in Manchester last month.

Dale Cregan, 29, has been charged with their murders, the murders of father and son David and Mark Short and four other counts of attempted murder.
