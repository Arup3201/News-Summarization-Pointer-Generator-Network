Charles Saatchi has decided not to sue former wife Nigella Lawson as he wants to 'get on with his life', it has emerged.

Sources close to Saatchi, 70, had suggested he was willing take his ex-wife to court in order to reveal the ‘truth’ about their break-up following the release of a series of photographs showing him with his hands on her neck.

But the art tycoon, who is dating fashion expert and journalist Trinny Woodall who he's been spotted with several times in recent months, now appears to have changed his mind about legal action.

Charles Saatchi has reportedly dropped his threat to sue ex-wife Nigella Lawson for £500,000

The threat to take legal action against the celebrity chef came despite the fact Saatchi had made a formal admission of assault.

But he became furious after being publicly reviled for the incident and threatened to sue Miss Lawson, 53, for £500,000 and reveal the 'truth' about their relationship.

He is said to have been ‘disappointed’ when the ‘Domestic Goddess’ would not state publicly that he did not physically abuse her - and this is when he instructed his lawyers.

But the proposed legal action has now been dropped with friends telling the Telegraph that he ‘wants to get on with his life’.

On the photographs, one friend told the paper that there is ‘far more to it than meets the eye’.

The images were taken outside restaurant Scott’s in June - the same exclusive spot where Saatchi has since been spotted alongside Ms Woodall, 49.

Full details of Saatchi’s allegations about Miss Lawson following the divorce could not be made public for legal reasons - but were strongly denied by her spokesman and lawyers.

The threat to sue meant they could have been revealed at the High Court in London.

His lawyers sent a legal letter to Miss Lawson’s solicitors warning that he was poised to sue her for around half a million pounds in a bid to clear his name.

The letter warned that if she refused to settle the matter voluntarily, legal action in court would ensue.

Saatchi, who was Miss Lawson’s second husband, attempted to dismiss the photographs that ended his ten-year marriage as a ‘playful tiff’ initially.

He then said ‘my actions were not 
violent’ and that he was ‘disappointed’ Miss Lawson had not publicly 
said he had ‘never abused her physically in any way’.

The couple’s marriage ended in a brief hearing just seven weeks after the incident.

Miss Lawson had petitioned for divorce on the grounds of Saatchi’s ‘unreasonable behaviour’. She said the marriage had ‘irretrievably broken down’.

The couple had married in 2003 following
the death of Miss Lawson’s first husband, broadcaster and journalist 
John Diamond, from throat cancer in 2001.

Since their separation, Miss Lawson has been living in rented accommodation in Central London.
