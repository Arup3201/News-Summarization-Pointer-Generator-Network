A group of travellers moved onto a seafront park yesterday - and promptly received parking tickets on their luxury caravans as they soaked up the sun.

The group - who arrived in about 10 vehicles - parked up on Hove Lawns in East Sussex immediately sparking complaints from passers-by of rubbish left near the Kingsway coastal road - almost directly opposite the local council’s offices.

Council officials visited the travellers with police and traffic wardens to issue penalty charge notices to some of their vehicles, and also served them with a notice to leave the area.

Council litter pickers also visited to tidy up. One of the travellers told the Brighton Argus that they were holidaymakers from London who had stopped because one of their vehicles had broken down.

They said they had been planning on going to Clacton-on-Sea in Essex - which is more than 120 miles away. If they do not leave by Friday then a court hearing will take place, the council said.

Local police confirmed that some of the travellers had purchased parking tickets, but others had not and were given penalty charge notices by parking enforcement officers.

A Brighton and Hove City spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘The council has carried out a joint visit with the police and parking enforcement officers to a group of ten lived-in vehicles parked on the highway opposite Brunswick Terrace in Hove, adjacent to Hove Lawns.

‘We have issued penalty charge notices to illegally-parked vehicles and are continuing to work closely with the police to monitor the situation.

‘We have also served a notice to leave the area under Section 77 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act and a court hearing will take place this coming Friday should the travellers fail to leave before then.’

Sussex Police said that officers were monitoring the situation but they had no power to act.

A spokesman said: ‘Approximately ten motor homes moved onto the seafront highway at Hove on Tuesday, September 2. It is understood parking tickets have been purchased.

‘Police have no powers under Section 61 in this situation. Brighton & Hove City Council is believed to have served Section 77 notices requiring the motorhomes to move on, so the onus is with the council at this stage. Sussex Police continue to monitor the situation.’

The group were still on the site at 3pm today, despite reportedly saying they would leave by midday.

It comes after around 15 caravans were seen yesterday three miles away from Hove Lawns on Surrenden Field in Withdean, and 30 were spotted on Hangleton Green, also three miles away.
