 The World Health Organization says the number of Ebola deaths has passed 5,000.

The U.N. health agency said Wednesday that overall 14,098 people are believed to have been infected with Ebola, the vast majority of those in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Of those, 5,160 have died.

There are some signs that the rate of new infections may be slowing in Guinea and Liberia, but they are surging in Sierra Leone, it said. In addition, the agency said that there are still areas of Liberia and Guinea where transmission remains high. 

The agency has said even these unprecedented tolls are likely an underestimate because many sick people have been too afraid or unable to seek care.

Ebola fear: A dozen people have been quarantined in Mali's capital after the death of 25-year-old nurse Saliou Diarra was confirmed to have been caused by Ebola

The news comes as a dozen people were quarantined by authorities in Mali after a 25-year-old nurse died from Ebola on Tuesday.

Family and colleagues who had been in contact with the nurse, identified by family as Saliou Diarra, have been quarantined in order to prevent Ebola from returning to Mali.

Mr Diarra died yesterday after he treated an imam from Guinea who died with Ebola-like
symptoms in the capital Bamako.

The imam from the border town of Kouremale was never tested
for the disease and his body was washed in Mali and returned to
Guinea for burial without precautions against the virus. 

Two aid workers said that another person who lived in the
house where the imam stayed in Bamako had died this week and was
buried without being tested.

A doctor at the Pasteur Clinic where the nurse worked - one
of Bamako's top medical centres - is also suspected to have
contracted Ebola.

Mali, the sixth West African nation to record Ebola, must
now trace a new batch of contacts just as people linked to its
first and only other case - a two-year-old girl who died last
month - completed their 21-day quarantine on Tuesday.

Concern is growing at the time it took between the imam
dying and the steps needed to contain the deadly disease being
put in place. Dr. Samba Sow, head of Mali's Ebola response, said
the imam died on Oct. 27, two days after going to the clinic.

'This case shows the lack of training of doctors in Bamako.
This training should have been done six months ago,' one aid
worker told Reuters, asking not to be named.

The government said in a statement on Wednesday that Mr Diarra was confirmed to have Ebola on Tuesday and died later that
evening. All necessary steps to identify people who had come
into contact with the nurse had been taken, it said.

Ousmane Doumbia, secretary general of the health ministry,
said 70 people had been quarantined. The Pasteur Clinic was
locked down by police on Tuesday night.

Mali shares an 800 km (500 mile) border with Guinea, which
alongside Liberia and Sierra Leone, has been worst affected by
an outbreak that has killed nearly 5,000 people this year. The
two-year-old girl had also brought Ebola to Mali from Guinea.

Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond visited several Ebola treatment centres in Sierra Leone to see the challenges of the epidemic first hand. 

Commenting ahead of the visit, Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, said: 'The UK is leading the international effort to defeat Ebola in Sierra Leone. 

'I shall be getting an update on our intervention and seeing how our support is making a difference when I meet members of our Armed Forces and health workers who have joined the fight to end Ebola.
