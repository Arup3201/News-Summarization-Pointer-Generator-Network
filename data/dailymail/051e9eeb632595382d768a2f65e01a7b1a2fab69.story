A mother was caught on camera multiple times choking her 15-month old son while he was in the hospital receiving treatment, police said. 

Dashana Oldham, 20, allegedly choked him at least eight times within an hour and 20-minute period at a children’s hospital in Indianapolis.

Doctors at the hospital had hooked him on a video EEG to monitor the boy’s symptoms.

Place: She had taken her son to the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis for tests; doctors filmed her choking her son during the tests

According to the Indy Star, Oldham had been taking her son to Riley Children’s Hospital for a few months because the boy’s extremities would turn blue and he would lose consciousness. 

When the doctors noted significant dips in the boy’s oxygen levels, they looked to his EKG video, which revealed Oldham choking him.

She then tells her son: ‘Just go night, night,’ according to the court documents.

The syndrome, named after an 18th century German officer known to embellish his stories – is a made-up disorder or mental illness where a patient acts as if they have a symptom or mental issue.

The truth is, though, the patient causes the disorder themselves. Some examples of the syndrome are people faking cancer, infections, and skin disorders. 

The documents also state that Oldham continued to choke her son even after he had vomited, but asks him, ‘Are you okay?’

At that point, the oxygen alarm went off, and the video shows Oldham calmly pressing the nurse call button, according to the Indy Star.

However, as the probable cause affidavit notes, her son’s symptoms were due to proxy symptoms of Munchausen syndrome – that is, when a person acts as though they have a physical disorder when they in fact have caused the symptoms.

The 20-year-old mother also said that she was only trying to administer CPR to her son in the video.

Later, she told police that she was not trying to kill her son, but if she had that goal in mind, would have used more pressure. 

Oldham has been charged with six counts of aggravated battery, as well as six counts of neglect of a dependent. 

She is being held on $40,000 bond.
