Manchester United have identified Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan as the leading contender to fill Michael Carrick's midfield role.

United are eyeing a £20.5million deal for the central midfielder, and reports emanating from Germany on Friday indicated a deal is now close - though those claims were later denied.

United will seek to sign Carrick's successor this summer as part of another huge spending frenzy.

Dortmund's ball-playing midfielder Gundogan has been watched extensively by United and has emerged as their primary target.

Van Gaal has an intrinsic knowledge of the Bundesliga and believes the 24-year-old has the ability to take over from Carrick on a long-term basis.

Carrick, who recently signed a new 12 month extension, will continue to be part of Van Gaal's plans next season - but the club are planning for life without him.

Van Gaal has been hugely impressed with Carrick's contribution at Old Trafford this season.

The England international's passing range and ability to dictate the pace of a match has been a key feature for United this season.

But at the age of 33, the Dutchman knows the midfielder is in the twilight of his career, while the amount of time Carrick has spent injured this season is also a worry.
