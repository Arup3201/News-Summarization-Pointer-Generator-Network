Chief Inspector Mick Williams was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and is currently on police bail

A top officer from a scandal-hit force has been suspended after his teenage son was jailed for sexually abusing underage girls.

Chief Inspector Mick Williams has been taken off duty by Cleveland Police following his arrest on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

He and his wife were arrested late last year, but the news only emerged following their son’s sentencing on Friday.

Darryl Williams, 19, wept in the dock at Newcastle Crown Court as he was sentenced to two years and nine months behind bars.

The court heard the ‘predatory’ youth had exploited ‘young and impressionable females’. 

He pleaded guilty to six offences against five girls aged between 12 and 15, over three years.

Judge John Milford told him: ‘You had a high sex drive and were persistent. I am satisfied that you are an ongoing risk to underage females and that risk needs to be managed.’

A Police spokesman last night confirmed his father’s arrest, saying: ‘He is currently suspended and the file is with the CPS awaiting their decision.’

Cleveland Police has been at the centre of a lengthy corruption probe in recent years.

Sean Price became the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years after he was found guilty of misconduct.

Last month he was told he would not face charges at the end of a £4 million inquiry.

But ten people have now been arrested 
over alleged improprieties involving the spending of public money, 
contracts, bonuses and payoffs.

Documents published at the end of 
the investigation claim former senior officers spent thousands on force 
credit cards on flowers, at restaurants and at luxury hotels.

The police
 watchdog is still investigating benefits received by ex-Cleveland 
deputy chief constable, Ron Hogg, now Police and Crime Commissioner for 
Durham.
