Sir Michael Wilshaw claimed a thorough investigation found claims children were asked inappropriate questions were false

Ofsted guidance at the heart of a major row over ‘inappropriate’ questions fired at primary pupils can be revealed for the first time today.

For years inspectors have been internally briefed that they can quiz pupils aged four to 11 about the word ‘gay’ and same-sex families, it has emerged.

They have been told to ask young children if classmates are ever picked on for not behaving like a ‘typical girl’ or a ‘typical boy’. And since 2013 Ofsted briefings have also urged inspectors to tackle ‘transphobic’ bullying, by asking primary children if they think someone ‘born a girl who would rather be a boy, or born a boy who would like to be a girl’ would feel safe at their school.

Ofsted has repeatedly denied that youngsters have been questioned about ‘inappropriate’ topics since the introduction of new rules last year requiring schools to promote ‘British’ values. 

Last week, Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, told the Commons’ education select committee that he had conducted a ‘thorough’ investigation into claims children were asked inappropriate questions and found them to be false.

But as early as January 2012, the schools watchdog published a briefing for inspectors, telling them they could quiz primary pupils about aspects of homophobic bullying such as the use of the word ‘gay’ in school.

In September 2013, the watchdog produced a new document, Exploring The School’s Actions to Prevent and Tackle Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying, which endorses asking primary pupils wide-ranging questions about homosexuality and transgender.

It said: ‘Inspectors should make sure that questions are age-appropriate and asked in the right context.

‘With primary pupils inspectors might explore whether pupils ever hear anyone use the word “gay” when describing something, or whether they have been told by teachers that using the word “gay”, to mean something is rubbish, is wrong, scary or unpleasant and why it is wrong.’

Other topics to discuss included whether ‘pupils ever get picked on by other children for not behaving like a “typical girl” or a “typical boy’’’, and if they had lessons about ‘different types of families (single parent, living with grandparents, having step-parents, having two mums or two dads)’.

This guidance, last issued in April 2014, also suggested inspectors could discuss with primary children if they thought ‘someone born a girl who would rather be a boy, or born a boy who would like to be a girl’ would ‘feel safe at school and be included’.

Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland has been put in special measures after the official Ofsted report found that discrimination ‘persisted’ there

Durham Free School is to close after a damning report which claimed pupils held 'discriminatory' views 

At secondary level, inspectors were told to explore with students whether a pupil or teacher ‘who thought of themselves as the opposite gender, feels safe and free from bullying at school’.

This ‘briefing for section 5 inspection’ – along with other Ofsted documents – were replaced by a new, single School Inspection Handbook, officially published last September, which makes no reference to these types of questions.

Two months later, Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland and Durham Free School were inspected by Ofsted.

Grindon Hall, which has been put into special measures after children were labelled intolerant, has accused inspectors of questioning ten-year-olds about whether they knew what lesbians ‘did’, and if any of their friends felt trapped in the ‘wrong body’.

And Durham Free School is set to close after Ofsted said some children displayed ‘discriminatory’ views towards people of other faiths. 

Governors have claimed that inspectors asked pupils questions including ‘do you know anybody in the school who is gay?’ It is also alleged a girl of around 12 was asked if she was a virgin.

Simon Calvert, of The Christian Institute charity, said: ‘It does look like Ofsted inspectors continue to be influenced by this guidance.

‘Sir Michael Wilshaw needs to take responsibility for the actions of his inspectors. He also has to take responsibility for the fact that guidance has been issued that has created a culture within Ofsted where inspectors think it’s appropriate to talk to young children in these ways.’

An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘Last year, Ofsted replaced a number of individual guidance documents with a new, single inspection handbook, in line with our new approach to placing more emphasis on training for inspectors rather than a reliance on extensive written guidance.’
