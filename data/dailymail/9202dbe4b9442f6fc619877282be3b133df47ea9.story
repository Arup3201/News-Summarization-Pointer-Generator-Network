St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch announced on Monday night that Darren Wilson would not be indicted in a bizarre press conference that instead found others to blame.

In the 25-minute announcement, he slammed news outlets and social media - suggesting they were responsible for the tension after the August 9 shooting, rather than the shooting itself.

'The most significant challenge encountered in this investigation has been the 24-hour news cycle and its insatiable appetite for something, for anything to talk about, following closely behind with the non-stop rumors on social media,' he said.

The users of social media promptly expressed their shock at the claim.

'Remember that time social media shot an unarmed teenager, and left his body on the street for four hours? Bob McCulloch remembers,' actor Wil Wheaton tweeted.

Author Maureen Johnson said: 'Social media isn't the problem. Shooting children is the problem.'

Writer and activist Kimberly C. Ellis added: 'Bob McCulloch is blaming social media again. Meanwhile, if it weren't for social media, we wouldn't even know about #MikeBrown #Ferguson.'

McCulloch also turned on the witnesses, saying their statements were largely inconsistent and 'some were completely refuted by the physical evidence'.

In another poor choice of words, McCulloch said the 12-person grand jury 'gave up their lives' while combing over the evidence and meeting with experts. 

CNN's legal expert Jeffrey Toobin called the press conference 'an extended whine' and said it was 'entirely inappropriate and embarrassing'. 

The grand jury ultimately decided that Darren Wilson would not face a trial for shooting dead 18-year-old Michael Brown in broad daylight in Ferguson, Missouri in August.

Following the death, there were mass - sometimes violent - demonstrations in Ferguson and across the country as protesters called for the police officer to be held accountable.

On Monday, McCulloch released details about the incident, including how Brown allegedly taunted Wilson in his police car, saying he was 'too much of a p***y to shoot me' after the officer asked him and a friend to walk on the sidewalk instead of in the road.

A confrontation ensued and Wilson claimed he felt overpowered by the 6ft 5 teen, who he went on to fire at 12 times.

The New Republic also commented on how McCulloch's announcement, which detailed the police investigation and decision, also implicitly dismissed the need for a trial.

'The point of a grand jury isn't to determine beyond a shadow of a doubt what actually happened,' Noam Scheiber wrote. 'It's to determine whether there's probable cause for an indictment, which requires a significantly lower standard of proof.

'That McCulloch appeared to turn the grand jury into an exercise in sorting out the former rather than the latter suggested he wanted no part of a trial.' 

Wheaton added on Twitter: 'If only there were some process, perhaps a legal process, to present conflicting accounts and statements, weigh them, and come to a verdict.'
