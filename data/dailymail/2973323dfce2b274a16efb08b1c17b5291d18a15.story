When Chris Leadbetter took a photo of his grandfather in hospital, he hoped it would be an image he could treasure after the pensioner was told his bladder cancer was terminal. 

However when Mr Leadbetter examined the picture he noticed there was a chilling figure of a woman behind his grandfather, Bob Large.  

Stunned, he showed staff at the Countess of Chester Hospital the photograph who went on to describe the 'long haired blonde girl', who they claim, a lot of patients see lurking at the end of their beds.

And the ghostly figure may have had an impact of Mr Large as he has since been released from hospital and sleeping better than before, despite the previous diagnosis.

Chris Leadbetter noticed the  image of a woman, in a veil, behind his grandfather after he went to visit him in the Royal Countess of Chester Hospital where he was being treated for terminal cancer, and took a photo

Mr Leadbetter had gone to visit his grandfather at the hospital in Chester, which is on the site of the former County Lunatic Asylum, built in 1829. 

The pensioner had been told his bladder cancer and kidney failure was terminal.  

Mr Leadbetter arrived to find the local vicar at his grandfather's bedside, praying for his recovery, and decided to take the 'last' picture on his mobile phone.

But it was not until he got home a week later and examined it that he saw a spectre-like figure of a woman, dressed in a veil, lurking in the back of the picture.  

The 20-year-old said: 'When I saw it the hairs just stood up on me. I was so freaked out. I saw the picture late at night so I went and woke the rest of my family up straight away.

'Everyone in the family was shocked. They couldn't believe it.

'My granddad is still alive now and has actually been released from hospital, despite what the doctors said.

'He finds the picture quite comforting. He thinks that someone is looking over him.'

When he asked the manager of Ward 44, where his grandfather was a patient, about the image she said: 'Oh, her. Lots of patients see her at the end of their beds'.

The manager, unprompted, then went on to describe the 'long haired blonde girl in a white gown'. 

He added: 'I took the picture the day before I went on holiday because we were told to expect the worst. 

The Cheshire County Lunatic Asylum opened in September 1829 on the site, under the 1808 County Asylum Act.

It initially had 90 beds, with people sleeping on straw mats, according to the History of Upton-by-Chester website. 

The front section of the building included the kitchens, brewhouse, storehouse and laundry.

However demand for beds rose as mental health care improved and by 1900 there was room for 900 patients at the site, and further building work took place. 

The site was turned into a fully functioning hospital in 1968 when other facilities were built there, alongside the mental health unit. It was known as West Cheshire Hospital. 

In 1984 the hospital was re-named the Countess of Chester Hospital, in honour of Princess Diana who reopened it. The Countess of Chester had been one of her titles. 

The City Hospital and Royal Infirmary sites, that were part of the foundation trust in Chester have since closed and all services are delivered at the Countess of Chester building.

'I didn't notice anything until about a week ago when I needed to go through my phone and delete some pictures.

'The strange thing is there is nothing between my granddad, who is sat on the corner of the bed, and the women in the picture - no glass, or windows or anything.

'A few people suggested it looked like a reflection but there is literally nothing for it to reflect off. '

Mr Leadbetter added: 'My gran told the ward manager she needed to speak to him about something and the second she said she had a picture of a ghost he described it perfectly.

'He says it'd not the first time the ghost had been seen. One patient was screaming in the night because it was at the end of her bed.'

Mr Large said: 'The picture is of my guardian angel. I've been in that hospital, on the same ward so many times.

'The vicar always comes in and says prayers and then goes and I always feel much better. Every time I feel like there is a presence in the room.

'I've just got a feeling that whoever it is, is watching over me. This is the first time I've actually seen her but I've had the feeling she's been there a while.

'It's the strangest thing. I can't explain it. I'll be lying there feeling very ill. Then I'll get the feeling of the presence. Then I'll suddenly feel much better and I can sit up.

'The face looks very familiar to me, but I don't think it's anyone I know. I think I just recognise the presence.

'Gosh, how he caught it on camera I don't know. I can't understand it. It's amazing.

'She'll continue to watch over me - I'm sure of it.'

Mr Large's wife Shelia, said: 'The picture is the talk of the town. Bob is telling everyone.

'After that picture was taken he slept for the whole night. The best he has slept in a long time. He thinks it was because of the angel.

'He's telling all the nurses and doctors who come to visit him that someone is looking out for him.'
