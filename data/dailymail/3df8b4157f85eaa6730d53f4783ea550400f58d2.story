It may be almost seven decades since the Germans last flew them during World War II and used them in a series of devastating bombing raids on London, Coventry and Norwich.

But German bombers will be filling the skies above some of the world's most famous landmarks again - with the help of a new app aimed at promoting the RAF Museum's latest exhibit.

Using a specially developed Augmented Reality App, called Apparition: Dornier Do 17, a full scale, 3D vision of the aircraft can be placed in various locations around the globe.

Under seige: Dornier Do17 bombers will be flying above London seven decades after the Second World War as a new app developed by the RAF Museum brings history back to life

Bringing history to life: The app, designed to celebrate the museum's latest exhibit, will be available from October 16

The new app has been developed thanks to a £75,000 grant from Wargaming which has allowed the museum to work with redLoop 
design and innovation centre to develop a new way of bringing history back to life.

Available from October 16, visitors to the museum, and a number of other museums across Europe will be able to hold up their smartphones and see computer generated versions of the 'flying pencil' aircraft flying above the scene in front of them.

The app has been developed following the retrieval of the last surviving 
Dornier Do 17 from the Goodwin Sands off the coast of Kent back in June - the 
biggest recovery of its kind in British waters.

Royal Air Force Museum Director General, Peter Dye: 'This heralds a new era of exhibition display and what Museums can achieve.

'For the first time ever the same 3D exhibit is visible in defined physical sites around the world.'

The Dornier aircraft recovered from Kent waters in June was first spotted by divers in 2008, lying 50ft below the surface on a chalk bed, surrounded by debris.

Sonar scans carried out by the RAF 
Museum, Wessex Archaeology and the Port of London Authority confirmed 
that the plane is the Dornier Do 17Z Werke number 1160, which was shot 
down during the Battle of Britain.

Two
of its four-man crew were killed as it crashed into the sea, but the 
other two were captured and taken into custody as prisoners of war.

The badly-damaged aircraft was transported more than 200 miles in June from Ramsgate, Kent, to RAF Cosford in Shropshire after spending seven decades at the bottom of the English Channel.

Since its arrival on June 15, thousands of visitors have viewed the Dornier and additional viewing panels have been installed to allow visitors to see more of the aircraft.

The plan to raise the plane - three years in the making - involved attaching lifting equipment to the strongest parts of the aircraft's frame and raising it whole in a single lift on June 10.

Judging by the serial number on the aircraft it was shot down on August 26, 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain. It was nicknamed the Luftwaffe's 'flying pencil' because of its narrow fuselage.

Around 1,500 models of the aircraft were built, but this is the last remaining. Originally it would have been camouflaged green and dark green on top with swastikas outlined in white on both rudders.

Historical: The remains of the plane are currently being restored and will go on display at the RAF Museum

The Dornier's bombs devastated large areas of London, Coventry and Norwich as one of the Luftwaffe's most important assets in the early phase of the Second World War.

Historians believe this particular plane took off on the morning of August 26, with eight other Dornier bombers from St Trond in German-occupied Belgium to bomb the RAF fighter base Manston in Kent.

The Luftwaffe lost three of its Dorniers that day, including this one. After an attempted controlled landing, the plane somersaulted and landed on its back.

Wireless operator Helmut Reinhardt and Bomb Aimer Heinz Huhn died and their bodies were washed up in Holland and England respectively, where they were buried in war cemeteries.

The other two crew members, Pilot Willi Effmert and Bomb Aimer Hermann Ritzel survived and spent the rest of the war in British prisoner-of-war camps.

Experts have been excited by the find because, apart from the effects of sea life - such as barnacles, coral and marine life, it is largely intact.

Amazingly the main undercarriage tyres remained inflated, although the propellers clearly showed the damage inflicted during the bomber's fateful final landing.

The Dornier Do 17 was known as the 'flying pencil', because of its unusually narrow fuselage.

It was one of the main bombers used by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War, including at the Battle of Britain in 1940.

The plane was developed to be a commercial aircraft, but was turned down by Lufthansa and redesigned into a bomber.

Although the Do 17 was no longer made after 1940, it was used by Nazi forces throughout the war.

More than 400 of them were flown in the Battle of Britain, with 171 shot down by the RAF or otherwise lost.

The planes were 52ft long with a wingspan of 59ft, and could carry 2,000lb of explosives while manned by a crew of four.

None of the aircraft were believed to have survived for long after the end of the conflict, until the discovery of the plane off the coast of Kent.
