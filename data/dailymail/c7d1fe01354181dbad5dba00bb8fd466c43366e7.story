More than 20,000 people have been forced from their homes as German authorities prepare to defuse a massive bomb dating back to World War Two.

Thousands of properties within a radius of 1.5km of the bomb were evacuated in the west German city of Dortmund.

The 4,000-pound bomb was discovered after experts analysed old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded ordnance dropped on Germany's industrial Ruhr region by Allied aircraft.

Experts examining old aerial photographs of Dortmund discovered the 4000-pound bomb, which is thought to have been dropped by the Allies during the Battle of the Ruhr

City authorities said they expect the operation to defuse the bomb will be completed by 2.30pm (3.30pm local time).

While unexploded WWII-era bombs are regularly discovered in Germany, they are rarely as big as the one uncovered in Dortmund.

A similar discovery two years ago prompted another mass evacuation, affecting 45,000 people in the city of Koblenz, along the River Rhine.

Rescue workers helped people from their homes today. The city authorities said they expect the operation to defuse the bomb to be completed by 2.30pm or 3.30pm local time

The Battle of the Ruhr was a five-month campaign of strategic bombing launched in March 1943 by the Allies during World War Two.

Allied bombers had within their sights the vast network of coke plants and steelworks as well as 10 synthetic oil plants, in a bid to cripple Nazi Germany's war effort.

The campaign bombed 26 key targets, including the Krupp armament works in Essen, the Norstern synthetic oil-plant in Gelsenkirchen and the Rheinmetal-Borsig plant in DÃ¼sseldorf.

Organised defence and the cloud of industrial pollutants producing a semi-permanent smog or industrial haze hampered accurate bombing.

The British bomber force was made up of the twin-engined Vickers Wellington medium bomber and the four-engined Short Stirling, Handley Page Halifax and the Avro Lancaster.

British raids were carried out at night, the losses during daylight missions proving too heavy to bear.

Between them the Allies mounted 24-hour bombing raids, with the United States air force inflicting a series of raids during daylight hours, with close groups of bombers offering cover to one another.

The raids carried out during the Battle of the Ruhr severely disrupted German production with steel production falling by 200,000 tons and the armaments industry facing a steel shortfall of 400,000 tons.

Hitler and his minister for armaments Albert Speer were forced to cut planned increases in production.
