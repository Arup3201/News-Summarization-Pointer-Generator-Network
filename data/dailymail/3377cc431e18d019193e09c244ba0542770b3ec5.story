A man who was quarantined in a Gold Coast hospital this morning has been cleared by Queensland Health of not contracting the Ebola virus.

The 27-year-old man, believed to be Michael Walsh, was taken to Gold Coast University Hospital at 7.40am suffering from Ebola-like symptoms.

He is believed to have fallen ill while at a police watchhouse after he was arrested overnight for trespassing at Surfers Paradise. 

Dr Jeannette Young, Queensland's chief health officer, thanked all health and ambulance staff involved in handling the patient.

'It was a job well done and serves to show the community that our emergency preparedness plans are sound, and that they can rely on their health services,' she said in a statement.

A 27-year-old man, believed to be Michael Walsh, was rushed to a Gold Coast hospital and quarantined amid fears he had the Ebola virus on Thursday morning

A Gold Coast University Hospital spokeswoman said an incoming patient was being 'isolated and assessed' after being identified by paramedics 'as having symptoms of Ebola virus'

Dr Young said it was highly unlikely the Ebola virus would make its way to Queensland.She said anyone who had travelled to West Africa who was concerned about the outbreak and their health should contact their GP.

Paramedics were called as a precautionary measure after reportedly telling officers he was unwell.

Gold Coast Health is assessing a patient transferred to the Gold Coast University Hospital afterbeing identified by paramedics as having symptoms of Ebola Virus Disease.

The patient is being assessed in accordance with universal infection control procedures.

Our Director Infectious Diseases Dr John Gerrard had confirmed that Initial clinical assessmentsuggests it is exceedingly unlikely that the patient has Ebola Virus Disease but he is being isolatedin accordance with national guidelines.

The Gold Coast University Hospital has been designed to accommodate patients with infectiousdisease.

Prior to the results, Dr Young had  said the man would remain in hospital until the results of forensic testing were available.

'It's very unlikely that the results will come back positive,' she told reporters.

'He doesn't have a fever or early symptoms of Ebola.'

Dr Young said even if the results were positive, there would not be an outbreak of the deadly disease in Australia.

'We won't have an outbreak here because we are very prepared. We've got systems in place at the border to identify symptoms... and we have good systems of hygiene,' she said.

The hospital's Chief Executive Damian Green said earlier on Thursday the patient had been 'isolated and assessed' after being identified by paramedics 'as having symptoms of Ebola virus'.

'Gold Coast Health can confirm a patient has been transferred to Gold Coast University Hospital after being identified by paramedics as having symptoms of Ebola virus,' Mr Green said earlier on Thursday.

'(The hospital) is taking necessary precautions and has isolated the patient who is currentlybeing assessed.

'Gold Coast Heath has processes in place to safely manage such circumstances. Universal infection control procedures are in place and there is limited risk to patients and staff.'

The Director of Infectious Diseases, Dr John Gerrard, said the man was more likely to be suffering from malaria and his blood test results would be available on Thursday night

It is understood the man was charged with trespass after an incident on the property of the Chevron Renaissance hotel on Ferny Avenue, one of many huge tourist resorts in Surfers Paradise

Police told Daily Mail Australia the man was not complaining of any medical condition at the time of his arrest and subsequently taken to Southport Watchhouse.

It is understood he was charged with trespass after an incident on the property of the Chevron Renaissance hotel on Ferny Avenue, one of many huge tourist resorts in Surfers Paradise.

The manager of the hotel, Michelle Baldwin, told Daily Mail Australia the incident did not happen inside the building, but she refused to comment on whether it occurred out the front.

She said the man was not a guest of the hotel and she had not spoken to authorities about the incident.

Police said the man will face court on September 25.

The man was isolated in accordance with national guidelines at the Gold Coast University Hospital on Thursday

The WHO has recorded 4,293 cases of Ebola in five West African countries as of September 6 as a worker sifts through garbage inside a high risk quarantined area at a hospital in Liberia

It comes after British nurse Will Pooley contracted the disease while working in Sierra Leone.

Mr Pooley, 29, was rushed back to London's Royal Free Hospital for life-saving treatment and is now planning to return to Africa to continue his work.

'So while I'm happy to be recovered and alive, there's a lot of stuff on my mind with what's going on back there,' he said.

‘It would be relatively safe for me to go back and work there, and it's really the least I could do having received all this amazing care and have people look after me and potentially save my life.

'It's the least I could do to go back and return the favour to some other people, even just for a little while.'

The current epidemic is the largest Ebola outbreak in history and has already claimed the lives of at least 2,296 people.

The WHO said on Tuesday that it had recorded 4,293 cases of Ebola in five West African countries as of September 6.

The outbreak has already affected multiple countries and sparked several travel warnings.

It is a haemorrhagic fever spread through body fluids such as the blood, sweat or vomit of those who are infected with the disease.

WHAT IS EBOLA?Ebola is a viral illness. Initial symptoms can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding. 

WHEN DID THE OUTBREAK BEGIN?In December 2013 in Guinea, but it was not detected until March 2014. 

HOW MANY HAVE DIED?A total of 2,296 have died out of 4293 recorded Ebola cases in five West African countries, according to the WHO's latest report on September 6. 

HOW DOES IT SPREAD?It spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments.

WHEN ARE PEOPLE CONTAGIOUS?Ebola isn't contagious until symptoms appear. The incubation period - the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms - is two to 21 days. 

IS THERE A VACCINE?There is no licensed vaccine for Ebola available. This month scientists said they may have developed an effective vaccine for the Ebola virus after an experimental immunisation gave monkeys long-term protection from the deadly disease. 

WHEN DID IT FIRST EMERGE?Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, in Nzara, Sudan, and in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was in a village situated near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name. 

HOW WAS IT INTRODUCED TO HUMANS?In Africa, infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys and forest antelope.

A pair of experimental Ebola vaccines that protect monkeys from the fatal disease ravaging West Africa have been developed.

The vaccine is effective for at least five weeks in lab monkeys but requires boosting with an additional vaccine to extend its protection to 10 months, according to a new study.

The findings offer a glimpse of which - if any - of the Ebola vaccines in development will prove effective, and in what form.

Pharmaceutical firms are accelerating their efforts to provide Ebola vaccines and treatments as the worst known outbreak of the virus tears through West Africa, killing more than 2,000 people.

The results of the new study suggest, for instance, that a vaccine by pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) now being tested on healthy volunteers will protect against Ebola infection in the short term, but may have to be augmented for long-term protection.

The study, published in Nature Medicine, is the first to report that a vaccine regimen produced 'durable immunity' against Ebola, protecting four out of four monkeys for 10 months.

'He's had a little chicken soup': Wife of US missionary with Ebola says he is showing signs of improvement since arriving for treatment in Nebraska.

The vaccine uses a chimp adenovirus, closely related to a human version that causes upper respiratory tract infections, into which scientists spliced an Ebola gene.

The adenovirus infects cells in a vaccinated animal, causing them to take up the gene and produce Ebola proteins. That primes the immune system to attack the proteins of Ebola viruses when an infection occurs.
