Eczema, as any sufferer will attest, can be a real pain. But there may be a silver lining, it seems, as the condition may lower the risk of developing skin cancer.

People with eczema have an overactive immune system which means their skin easily becomes dry and prone to infection.

But this so-called defective skin barrier may also help them shed potentially cancerous cells from the skin and so protect against one of the most common types of skin cancer, squamous cell cancer (SCC).

Previous studies have suggested that having eczema may cut the risk of skin cancer.

But it is difficult to draw firm conclusions based on studies of humans because eczema symptoms vary in severity and drugs used to treat the condition might also influence cancer.

A new study from King’s College, London, is the first to show that allergy caused by the skin defects could actually protect against skin cancer.

People with eczema have an overactive immune system which means their skin easily becomes dry, inflamed and prone to infection.

There are no cures but medical moisturisers called emollients are used to keep the skin lubricated, backed up by topical steroid creams to control flare-ups.

Common ailment: There are about 12 million children in Britain, of which one in five has been diagnosed with eczema, around 2.4 million

A new study published online in eLife journal is the first to show that allergy caused by the skin defects could actually protect against skin cancer.

Eczema can result from the loss of structural proteins in the outermost layers of the skin, leading to a defective skin barrier. Genetically engineered mice lacking three skin barrier proteins - called ‘knock-out’ mice - were used to replicate some of the skin defects found in eczema sufferers.

The researchers compared the effects of two cancer-causing chemicals in normal mice and the knock-out mice. The number of SCC tumours per mouse was six times lower in knock-out mice than in normal mice.

The findings suggest that defects in the epidermal barrier protected the genetically engineered mice against tumour formation.

Researchers found that both types of mice were equally susceptible to acquiring cancer-causing mutations. However, an exaggerated inflammatory reaction in knock-out mice led to enhanced shedding of potentially cancerous cells from the skin.

This cancer-protective mechanism bears similarities to that which protects skin from environmental assaults such as bacteria.

Breakthrough: This most recent study is the first to show that allergy caused by the skin defects could actually protect against skin cancer

Professor Fiona Watt, of King’s College, said: ‘We are excited by our findings as they establish a clear link between cancer susceptibility and an allergic skin condition in our experimental model.

‘They also support the view that modifying the body’s immune system is an important strategy in treating cancer.

‘I hope our study provides some small consolation to eczema sufferers - that this uncomfortable skin condition may actually be beneficial in some circumstances.’ The researchers were funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Wellcome Trust and Cancer Research UK charity.

Skin cancer is a common and growing problem, accounting for one in every three cancers diagnosed worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

Malignant melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer, affecting almost 10,000 Britons a year, but more than 76,500 people are diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancers such as SCC each year.

It is estimated the true figure could be at least 100,000 because this cancer is far more likely to go unreported.

Dr Mike Turner, Head of Infection and Immunobiology at the Wellcome Trust, said ‘Skin cancer is on the rise in many countries and any insight into the body’s ability to prevent tumour formation is valuable in the fight against this form of cancer.

‘These findings that eczema can protect individuals from skin cancer support theories linking allergies to cancer prevention and open up new avenues for exploration whilst providing some (small) comfort for those suffering from eczema.’
