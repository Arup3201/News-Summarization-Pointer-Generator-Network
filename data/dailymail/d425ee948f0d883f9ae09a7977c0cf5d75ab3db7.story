Hundreds of people turned out to honour the Royal Navy helicopter carrier, HMS Illustrious, as it retired following a 32-year career.

The ship's White Ensign was lowered for the final time during a decommissioning ceremony marking the end of the last Navy Invincible-class aircraft carrier.

Lady Sarah Chatto, whose mother, the late Princess Margaret, launched 'Lusty' in 1978, was among the guests at Portsmouth Naval Base, in Hampshire.

Hundreds of people waved goodbye to HMS Illustrious as it retired following a 32-year career that saw her sail more than 900,000 miles on operations worldwide

Fifteen of the ship's 17 former commanding officers also witnessed the final bow of Illustrious, which sailed more than 900,000 miles on operations worldwide.

Captain Mike Utley, the 22,000-tonne ship's commanding officer, said they bade farewell with a mixture of sadness and pride.

He said: 'It has been a great honour to be the final commanding officer of HMS Illustrious. This is a symbolic day in the history of the Royal Navy as we lower the ensign for the final time on the Invincible class.'

Illustrious, which was rushed into service for the Falklands War, is being replaced as the nation's helicopter carrier by HMS Ocean that has recently undergone a £65 million refit.

It will eventually be replaced by two new 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers - HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales.

Illustrious went on to support the forces in Afghanistan and served in the Bosnia and Sierra Leone conflicts, and also helped evacuate Britons during the Lebanon war 

In 2008, Illustrious became the star of Channel 5's six-part documentary Warship, which followed its deployment to the Mediterranean, Africa and the Middle East

Illustrious, which was built by Swan Hunter shipbuilders on the Tyne, had its entry into service brought forward so it could aid the Falklands War effort.

Its deployment was so rushed that its commissioning ceremony took place at sea en route to the Falklands on June 20 1982. It was formally commissioned on its return.

During the conflict, it relieved sister ship HMS Invincible in providing a floating airfield for aircraft unable to use the islands' damaged RAF base.

The Ministry of Defence is looking to preserve Illustrious, with bids from private companies, charities and trusts to secure its future

Illustrious then went on to support the forces in Afghanistan and served in the Bosnia and Sierra Leone conflicts, and also helped evacuate Britons during the Lebanon war in 2006.

In 2008, the carrier became the star of Channel 5's six-part documentary Warship, which followed its deployment to the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East and south-east Asia for a series of exercises and diplomatic visits to 20 ports.

And last year, Illustrious was involved in efforts to distribute relief in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, which claimed more than 6,000 lives.

Following the retirement of the Harrier aircraft in 2010, Illustrious went on to serve as one of the navy's two helicopter carriers, the other being Plymouth-based HMS Ocean.

The Ministry of Defence is looking to preserve Illustrious, with bids from private companies, charities and trusts to secure its future.

One proposal is for it to become a tourist attraction in Hull. A condition of sale is that Illustrious remains in the UK, the Navy said.

Illustrious, the second of the three Invincible class carriers, was laid down at Swan Hunter on the River Tyne in 1976, and launched in 1978.

As the ship neared the end of its fitting out period, the Falklands War broke out.

Its deployment was so rushed that its commissioning ceremony took place at sea en route to the Falklands on June 20 1982. It was formally commissioned on its return.

llustrious then went on to support the forces in Afghanistan and served in the Bosnia and Sierra Leone conflicts, and also helped evacuate Britons during the Lebanon war in 2006.

The 22,000 tonne ship is 636ft long and 118ft wide. It can reach a maximum speed of 30 knots and can carry up to 22 helicopters.  

It is armed with three goalkeeper close-in weapon systems and two GAM-B01 20mm close-range guns.
