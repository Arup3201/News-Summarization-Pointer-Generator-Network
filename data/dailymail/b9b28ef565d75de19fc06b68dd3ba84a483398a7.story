Concerns: Child welfare campaigners yesterday questioned whether Jordan Nash could give 'informed consent' to the attention that comes with appearing on Britain's Got Talent

Britain's Got Talent has come under fire for allowing a five-year-old dancer on to the show and putting him through to the  next round.

Child welfare campaigners yesterday questioned whether Jordan Nash could give 'informed consent' to the attention that comes with appearing on the programme.

While the youngster, from London, received positive comments from the judges, there were concerns that he is too young to cope with fame, should he progress to the final stages of the competition.

The five-year-old, dressed in a black baseball cap and a t-shirt with his name on it, performed an impressive dance routine and was given a 'yes' by all four judges.

But viewers branded the decision 'inappropriate' and called on ITV to bring in new rules to 'stop this happening'.

Fears for Jordan renewed the controversy surrounding child performers on the programme, which drew hundreds of complaints in 2009 when two child singers, Hollie Steel and Natalie Okri, cried due to the pressure of performing live.

Last year Britain's Got Talent was again forced to defend its lack of an age limit when nine-year-old Malaki Paul broke down in tears after struggling to finish his song because of nerves.

In Saturday's show Simon Cowell joked about Jordan's youth, asking: 'How old are you – 20? 21?'After the youngster revealed his age Alesha Dixon added: 'Your mum and dad must be so proud of you.'

The boy is one of the youngest solo performers to have appeared on the show. Unlike The X Factor and The Voice, which insist contestants are 16 and over, Britain's Got Talent is open to performers of any age.

One viewer wrote on Twitter: 'A five-year-old on Britain's got Talent. Inappropriate! There should be some rules to stop this happening.'

Another, writing on Facebook, added: 'It's a shame for them, they will always be let down and have no chance of winning. He is only 5!'

One simply added: 'He was good but he's going to get his heart broken.'

There was also criticism of parents who allow their young children to go on to the programme.

Claude Knights, director of anti-bullying and child protection charity Kidscape, said: 'We have in the past been concerned by a trend in some of  these reality shows to have much younger children … the main concern being that a young child can't give informed consent to the consequences of the attention and exposure, to that degree.

'The programme makers of course say there are lots of safeguards in place … but when it does go wrong, who knows how and when the child could break down and not cope.'

A spokesman for Britain's Got Talent said  welfare of contestants was the show's 'number one priority'.

Alfie, Jordan's father, said: 'It would be a shame to deny any individual the opportunity to display their talent publicly whatever their age.'
