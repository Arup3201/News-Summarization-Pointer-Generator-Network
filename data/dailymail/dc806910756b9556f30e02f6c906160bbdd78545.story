Lewis Hamilton hit the top of the timesheets in Singapore as error-prone Pastor Maldonado hit the wall.

Hamilton posted the quickest lap of the afternoon session, 1.5seconds quicker than Mercedes team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg, who was  way down the order with only the 13th best time.

The session was temporarily suspended after Maldonado lost control of his Lotus through Turn 10 before crashing into the wall.

And the Venezuelan's incident hampered Rosberg who was conducting his low-fuel qualifying run on the supersoft tyres.

It brings to the end a run of seven consecutive one-two finishes at the conclusion of practice on the Friday of a race weekend.  

Since the first race in 2008, the infamous 'crashgate' event won by Fernando Alonso, there has never been a Singapore Grand Prix without a safety car.

It came as no surprise, therefore, a red flag emerged during practice - and even less of a surprise it was Maldonado who caused it. 

The stage is set for what is set to be another spectacular race under the lights in Singapore 

Eyes on the prize: Nico Rosberg is 22 points ahead of Hamilton with six races of the season remaining 

Maldonado, involved in more crashes than most throughout his career, lost the rear of his Lotus emerging out of Turn 10, sending the front-right ploughing into a wall.

There was further consternation for the team's mechanics as they watched the car being recovered by the marshals.

Swinging around loosely on the end of a crane as the marshals looked on, on a couple of occasions it banged against the track, causing further damage before finally being steadied.

For Rosberg, forced to abort his flying lap, the German was forced to settle for his best time on soft tyres of one minute 49.075 seconds.

That was 1.5secs adrift of Hamilton who led the way with 1min 47.490secs, finishing 0.133secs clear of Alonso in his Ferrari.

That was as surprising as the fact Alonso also finished out in front at the end of FP1, the first time the Spaniard had done so since first practice in Canada.

At this stage Alonso would appear to be in a position to give Rosberg and Hamilton a run for their money in qualifying on Saturday as the tight, twisty Marina Bay Street Circuit is to his car's liking.

Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was third quickest, three tenths of a second adrift, followed by Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari.

Four-times champion and winner of this event for the last three years in Sebastian Vettel was a remarkable fifth, 0.551secs behind Hamilton in his Red Bull.

At the end of FP1 Vettel's car suffered an engine issue which resulted in his mechanics spending all of their lunch break and the majority of FP2 working to replace the system.

With 10 minutes remaining Vettel finally made it out on track on a set of supersoft tyres to push himself up the order.

The McLaren duo of Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button were sixth and seventh quickest, both just under a second off the pace, followed by Force India duo Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez.

Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat rounded out the top 10, with Max Chilton 20th for Marussia, four seconds off the pace. 

Nico Rosberg was off the pace in the second practice session in Singapore, posting only the 13th best time
