The European Union was accused of ‘appeasement’ last night as Crimea opted to join Russia – and the EU failed to get tough with Vladimir Putin.

David Cameron persuaded fellow leaders to agree a three stage regime of punishments for Moscow – but it fell far short of the ‘serious consequences’ promised this week.

The EU will immediately suspend talks on a new visa regime with Russia, abandon plans for the G8 summit and ditch plans for a new partnership deal between Russia and the EU – but none of them hurts President Putin now and all three had been floated in advance.

Appeasement: EU leaders have been accused of being too soft on Russia as it ramps up war games over the Ukraine crisis. Pictured: Ukrainian riot police block pro-Russian activists in Donetsk, Ukraine, yesterday

Scuffles: Pro-Russians tackle Ukrainian police yesterday. Russian TV has claimed Crimea is part of its country

Anger: Topless activists demonstrate against Russian intervention in Ukraine yesterday in New York

Action: The U.S., with Secretary of State John Kerry, has sent fighter jets to protect the Baltic states

And last night the US sent fighter jets to protect the Baltic republics after warnings from former Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili - whose country was invaded in 2005 – that Putin would strike there next.

He said: ‘It will not stop here. If Mr Putin succeeds he will go after the Baltic countries next. The EU and Nato need to act now. They should consider the full range of options, from economic sanctions to military deterrence.’

Serious: Cameron has held emergency talks with Barack Obama, but this 'selfie' was widely mocked

The American government yesterday announced asset freezes and travel bans against Putin’s henchmen who led the invasion.

But EU leaders said they would only move to those tactics if Russia refuses talks with Ukrainian leaders – and then failed to impose a deadline, saying economic sanctions and a crackdown on Russian financiers would only happen if Putin seizes the rest of Eastern Ukraine.

British officials credited Mr Cameron and Polish premier Donald Tusk with persuading a reluctant German Chancellor Angela Merkel to consider asset freezes and travel bans in the future.

But even Mr Cameron admitted: ‘It is not as much as some people would want but we have made some progress.’

His own officials were withering about the EU’s timidity.

A senior official in London compared the EU’s failure to act to the appeasement of Hitler at Munich in 1938 and the reluctance to upset Russia in the Yalta summit at the end of the Second World which gave the Soviet Union a free rein in Eastern Europe.

The source told the Mail: ‘Brussels – now twinned with Yalta and Munich.’

The EU leaders appeared to have been caught on the hop as the Crimea’s puppet Parliament voted unanimously for the province to leave Ukraine and join Russia.

President Putin is now backing a referendum in Crimea on March 16 - tantamount to annexing the province.

Maps on at least one Russian TV station yesterday showed the peninsula as being part of Russian territory, not of Ukraine.

A senior official said that if the referendum goes ahead, all state property would be ‘nationalised’, the Russian rouble could be adopted and Ukrainian troops would be treated as occupiers and forced to surrender or leave.

Tensions: Residents hold the Soviet flag outside the parliament building in Simferopol, Ukraine, yesterday

War games: Vladimir Putin faces outside intervention, but many have warned it is not tough enough

Protest: One of the French women is carried off

Two French women staged topless demonstrations with slogans written across their bodies yesterday in Crimea’s capital Simferopol.

As hundreds of protesters celebrated the decision of the local parliament for the region to join Russia, the pair repeatedly yelled ‘Stop Putin’s war’ despite a volley of punches and abuse from the hostile crowd of pro-Russians.

One of the women – with a red floral headdress on her blonde hair – was quickly seized. 

Cossack paramilitaries dragged her away, one firing pepper spray in her face from close quarters. 

The second, with shorter black hair, ran around shouting before being grabbed by police and pro-Russian vigilantes.
