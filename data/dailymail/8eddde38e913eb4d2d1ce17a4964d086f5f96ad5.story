A producer for a conservative radio show in Florida has been arrested in the studio for allegedly having more than 500 'extremely disturbing' child porn images on his computer, police said.

Chand Worob, 25, had hundreds of sick images of boys and girls - some as young as five - on his home computer and also distributed them, Police Chief Mike Chitwood said.

The executive producer was arrested at the WNDB-AM 1150 studio in Daytona Beach after 'The Marc Bernier Show' wrapped up at 6pm on Thursday, the Daytona Beach News Journal reported.

'He knew why we were there,' Chitwood said. 'This is the guy that runs the entire show.'

The producer told officers that he needed to call his girlfriend.

Footage of his arrest shared with WFTV shows him being hauled out of a police car and taken to the station on Thursday night. In the video, he is apparently wearing a wedding band.

The chief said that the host of the show, Marc Bernier, and other employees at WNDB did not know about Worob's actions. 

Worob had unknowingly distributed explicit images to a officers during an investigation by a statewide task force called Internet Crimes Against Children.

On Tuesday, police obtained a warrant, entered his apartment and confiscated his computer, cellphone and iPad, Chitwood told the News Journal.

But when questioned, Worob said he sometimes looked at adult porn, but never child porn. He said if he had come across child porn, he would've deleted it.

Caught: He was arrested at the radio station but didn't seem surprised to see police there, they said. He is pictured being led to the Daytona Beach Police Department following his arrest on Thursday evening

'I may have seen some images like that a few times, but it would've been an accident,' he told the detectives. 'I don't even like young girls. I am into older women.'

When authorities showed him eight files he shared with law enforcement of nude girls between the ages of six and 12, he said they looked like images he had deleted.

But authorities found he had as many as 505 files of child pornography in several locations on the hard drive of his computer.

Some of the files had names for the underage children, including 'Lolita,' 'Preteen,' and 'Baby J', detectives said. 

'Some of them [were] extremely graphic, picturing children as young as five and six years old,' Chitwood told WESH. 'As a matter of fact, graphic is probably a bad term. Disgusting is the best way to describe it. You got to be a real scumbag because you're victimizing children.'

Worob has been charged with three counts of promoting sexual performance by a child and eight counts of possession of photographs of sexual performance by a child.

Workplace: He works on The Marc Bernier Show, hosted by long-time radio host Marc Bernier, pictured. Police have said that neither Bernier or any other employees at the station knew about Worob's actions

According to his Linkedin page, he has been with the station for two years. Before that, he worked at KYCA 1490 AM in Prescott, Arizona for four years after leaving Yavapai community college.

He joined The Marc Bernier Show, a weekday afternoon show in Florida, in February 2013. The show is on WNDB, a news station that also hosts conservative talk shows. 

Its host, Bernier, has worked for the station for more than two decades and had previously contributed to Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. He is also a news analyst for Fox 35 News in Orlando.

Worob was being held at the Volusia County Branch Jail on $110,000 bail.
