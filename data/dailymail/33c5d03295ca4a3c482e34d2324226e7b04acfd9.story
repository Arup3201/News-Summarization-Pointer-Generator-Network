Health officials are investigating a sudden fall in life expectancy amongst the elderly which is particularly stark in women.

There is concern it has been triggered by declining hospital care, a lack of GP appointments and cuts to home-help.

The alarm was raised by public health bosses in the North West who noted that that life expectancy aged 85 was ‘going backwards’.

And the trend was particularly pronounced for elderly women where, in one local authority, it had dropped from living a further 6.8 years aged 85 in 2011 to just 6.5 years.

Public Health England – the Government agency responsible for preventing early death – confirmed the fall in women’s life expectancy had occurred across the country and it was carrying out further analysis to establish the reasons.

But senior doctors and MPs are worried it is the beginning of a long-term trend brought about by cuts to the NHS and social care.

The email which triggered the investigation – leaked to Health Service Journal - was sent by Dominic Harrison, Director of Public Health in Blackburn with Darwen council, to Public Health England at the end of last month.

It reads: ‘I just wanted to alert you to the fact that it may now be likely that in many LA (local authority) areas in the NW (North West)/England are no longer living longer.’

‘This effect is statistically significant, sustained and (probably) preventable!’

It goes on to warn that such a ‘sustained’ reduction in life expectancy is ‘extremely unusual’ and should send out a public health ‘alarm’.

The email lists possible causes such as cuts to basic fall-prevention services and meals and wheels as well as worsening GP and hospital care.

Senior doctors are unsure as to why the fall has occurred in women and not men but believe it could be the start of a long-term trend affecting both sexes.

Dr John Middleton, vice president of the Faculty of Public Health , which represents 3,000 doctors and other specialists said: ‘I am concerned about these figures.

‘The obvious concern is about shortcomings in social care which is related to the current debate on accident and emergency

Liz Kendall MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Care and Older People, said: ‘This Government’s cuts to adult social care are having a devastating impact. Half a million fewer people are now getting vital care services, which means more are ending up in hospital or getting stuck in hospital when they don’t need to be there.

Professor John Newton, Chief Knowledge Officer at Public Health England acknowledged that although there had been a fall in life expectancy in women in 2012, early analysis suggested it hadn’t continued into 2013.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics for England show that life expectancy aged 85 for women has dropped from 6.85 years in 2009-11 to 6.83 years in 2011-13. For men it has continued to rise – although at a slower pace than previously - from 5.81 years to 5.83 years over the same period (file photo)

Referring to possible causes, he added: ‘[It is] influenced by many factors and has fluctuated from year to year in the past.

‘However, Public Health England is currently conducting further analysis of these trends and we hope to make the findings available in the near future.’

For men it has continued to rise – although at a slower pace than previously – from 5.81 years to 5.83 years over the same period.

But in certain areas including Blackburn it fell last year in men from 5.8 years in 2010-12 to 5.6 years in 2011-13.

The figures are calculated as an average for three years – for example the most recent 2011-13 data being the average life expectancy for 2011, 2012 and 2013.
