They are viewed by many now as a sign of animal cruelty, but centuries ago, owning a pair of intricately-carved elephant tusks were seen as mark of honour.

Now the biggest pair of tusks ever to come on the open market are expected to sell for £250,000, according to expert predictions.

Each piece of ivory measures over 6ft in length and they were intricately carved by expert craftsmen in China between the 17th to 19th century.

Skilled craftsmanship: The carved scenes on them show animals, plants, trees, birds, buildings and scenes from Chinese mythology. They also display people playing a board game, reading scrolls, riding on mythical creatures and playing musical instruments

They have been locked in storage for the
last 60 years by their European owner but they have now emerged for 
sale at a British auction house.

Experts believe that tusks of this size have never come up for auction before.

It is thought they came from an Asian elephant at a time when the ivory trade was more acceptable.

International trade in it has been banned since 1975.

The carved scenes on them show animals, plants, trees, birds, buildings and scenes from Chinese mythology.

They also display people playing a board game, reading scrolls, riding on mythical creatures, and playing musical instruments.

The tusks are hollow so the light falls through the ivory to create a stunning visual effect that makes the figures seem almost to move.

The large items rest upon carved, hardwood stands also of the finest quality.

They were made during China’s Qing Dynasty between 1644 and 1912 and were for a high-ranking individual who would have had them to show off his status.

It is not clear how and when they ended up in European ownership but their size and high quality would have made them highly desirable.

And they are considered to be just as sought-after today, especially among the newly-rich Chinese who are rapidly buying back their cultural heritage.

The tusks are expected to sell for more than a quarter-of-a-million pounds when they go under the hammer at Duke’s auction rooms in Dorchester, Dorset.

Guy Schwinge, from the saleroom, said: 'These are outstanding examples of Chinese ivory carving and date from the Qing Dynasty.

'They have been hidden in store for 
the last 60 years and they are likely to create great interest amongst 
collectors around the world.

'We have not been able to find a bigger pair that have been sold and the scale of these is quite impressive.

Big and beautiful: The tusks measure 74 inches (188cm) and 75.5 inches (192cm) without even taking into account the curvature

'By selling them we are not condoning the trade in modern ivory, but these are old and we have all the relevant documentation from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, the body that deals with these items.

'Carving them must have been a real labour of love and they demonstrate first class workmanship.

'The scale of these is so massive they are a real statement object. They depict many scenes including those from Chinese mythology and individuals in a variety of pursuits.

She said they had been stored in Switzerland for 60 years.

Antony Gray, a leading art dealer of Guest and Gray in London, said: 'I have never seen a pair of carved tusks on this scale before.

'You need oxygen for some of the prices being paid for this type of thing at the moment. You will not see better'.

The tusks measure 74 inches (188cm) and 75.5 inches (192cm) without even taking into account the curvature.

The sale is on May 10.
