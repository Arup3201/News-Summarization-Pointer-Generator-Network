A Mexican trying to enter the US for a heart and liver transplant has been denied a visa for the second time, he and his family announced Wednesday.

Jose Chua Lopez, 20, has suffered from a heart defect from birth and was hoping to enter the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where he has an appointment in 10 days.

'My world has fallen down,' Chua said. 'This needs to be fixed quickly.'

World has fallen: Jose Chua Lopez, 20, and his mother, Myra Lopez Martinez, said he had been denied a visa for the second time that would have allowed him to seek treatment for heart and liver conditions

His mother, Myra Lopez Martinez, said her son could die if he cannot receive the transplants.

A spokeswoman for the State Department, Jen Psaki, said people at the department are looking into the case, though the department did not have a comment on Chua's case. 

Consejo de Latinos Unidos, which is based in the US where it helps uninsured people secure medical care, stepped in to try to get Chua to the Mayo Clinic.

The organization's director, Kevin Forbes, said the case was mishandled at the US Consulate in the northern city of Hermosillo, where Chua lives. 

He said that consulate officials processed an application for a tourist visa when they should have told Chua to apply for a humanitarian visa and that they then failed for weeks to respond to queries about his status.

'We have dealt with around two dozen similar international cases,' Forbes said. 'They have never denied us a visa. It's the first time this has happened.'

Struggle: Chua's friends and family raised $15,000 to pay for an evaluation leading up to the treatment, and though the operation could millions more, Chua's mother says they will try

Weakened: Chua's heart has only one ventricle, which causes circulation problems, and at this point, in spite of several heart surgeries, his liver has also been damaged

Come together: Chua and his family have held fundraisers, such as Coffee for a Life, where several musical acts played to raise money for the treatments 

Big hopes: Chua wants to overcome his health problems and hopes to become a doctor

Long road ahead: Chua's family says the transplant will cost much more, and even as they are looking for help to fund it, they are unsure about how to pay the high cost

Forbes said the family would file a visa application on humanitarian grounds shortly and he hopes the problem will be resolved in two or three days.

He called the situation an 'absolute abomination.' 

Chua's heart has only one ventricle, causing circulation problems that mean blood reaches only one of the four chambers, said Dr Ernesto Duarte, who treats him.

Chua underwent three open-heart surgeries between the ages of 5 months and 12 years, including a cardiac implant that stopped working properly in 2013.

At this point Chua's liver has also been damaged, so he needs a double-organ transplant, a procedure that is not performed in his home country.

'The experience in Mexico for a transplant of that complexity is nil,' Duarte said, adding that 'nobody can be sure that he won't deteriorate at any moment.'

The doctor added that in severe cases, not performing the surgery in time can make a transplant impossible later.

Chua, whose father is an Arizona resident, had a US visa until he was 15. But when it expired, his family didn't renew it because they didn't have money to pay for more trips.

The family currently lives in a modest, one-story home in a potholed suburb of Hermosillo, capital of Sonora state. He shares a room with his brother.

Thin and pale with his body swollen from his condition and marked by scars from his operations, Chua is nevertheless active and optimistic about the future. 

He dreams of becoming a doctor, even though his health problems have so far made it impossible to attend college, work or stand up for long periods.

Family and friends in Hermosillo organized fundraisers, sold tamales, hamburgers and seafood and held raffles to defray the initial cost of his potential treatment at the Mayo Clinic.

'We needed $15,000 and we put together a little bit more, just for the evaluation' said Lopez. 'Afterward, the double transplant would cost around $2 million... For now, I don't want to think about that.'
