She's famous for her penchant for high street buys and the thrifty Duchess of Cambridge was at it again as she watched the action at the Commonwealth Games today.

Laughing and joking with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, Kate looked relaxed in her £79.99 double-breasted Zara blazer and trusty J Brand skinny jeans.

Finishing off the look were her fail-safe £245 Stuart Weitzman navy wedges, which, like the jeans and the jacket, have made regular appearances.

Favourites: Kate's ensemble included all of her go-to pieces, including a £79.99 Zara blazer

All three were worn on several occasions during the royal tour of Australia and New Zealand with the Duchess donning jacket and heels for her trip to Auckland - even if she did swap the heels for a pair of Sebago flats ahead of a boat trip around the harbour.

Prior to her trip to New Zealand, Kate wore the ensemble for another sporty event at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in East London in her role as patron of the charity SportsAid last October.

Prince Harry, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge attend the gymnastics during the Commonwealth Games - have they got some interesting snaps of the gymnasts in action?

Committed royal fans will also remember seeing the Duchess in the ensemble during a visit to the Olympic Games in London two years ago.

There, the Duchess, who was meeting sports stars in the athlete's village, won the approval of Rebecca Adlington, who told the Duchess that she loved her navy wedges.

But it isn't only the wedges and blazer to have made repeat appearances: The jeans too have also been worn on multiple occasions.

Most recently, the Duchess teamed them with her faithful Sebago tan deck shoes and Me + Em striped Breton t-shirt to watch her husband and Prince Harry play polo in Gloucestershire.

Despite looking wonderful, however, the presence of Prince George meant that for once, she wasn't the only royal to sell out her outfit with the infant prince's Petit Bateau dungarees proving even more popular.

In her jeans: The Duchess of Cambridge wore J 
Brand jeans three days in a row in Canada in 2011. Kate purchased the 
811 style from Trilogy's Chelsea store over three years ago (among other 
styles that she has bought from the store over the years) and has been 
wearing them ever since
