Plans for an exclusive £30m hotel and golf course development on the estate that was home to press baron Lord Beaverbrook have been given the green light after a lengthy legal battle.

The proposals for Cherkley Court near Leatherhead, Surrey, were scrapped when a High Court judge quashed planning permission in August.

Now the Court of Appeal has ruled that plans to turn the historic greenbelt estate into a golf resort can go ahead after all.

Grandeur:  Cherkley Court near Leatherhead in Surrey, will now become a luxury golf resort after a High Court decision was overturned on appeal. It is the former estate of media baron and politician Lord Beaverbrook

Mr Justice Haddon-Cave found Mole Valley District Council's decision to grant planning permission on such an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty was perverse, and that the council had 'erred in law'.

But Law Lords yesterday overturned his judgement after an appeal by the council and developer Longshot Cherkley Court.

Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the Express Newspaper Group and minister during both World Wars, bought the property after a single viewing in 1911.

Prime Minister Winston Churchill, to whom he acted as a confidante, is said to have had his own room because he spent so much time there.

In 2010 the historic country house closed to the public and was put up for sale after the Beaverbrook Foundation decided it could no longer be profitable.

The project, which is expected to create 200 jobs, includes an 18-hole golf course which is being co-designed by golfer Tom Watson.

Local campaigners, backed by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), argued the project would blight precious chalk grassland habitat. They said ecological and water surveys should have been carried out.

Ian Todd, director of developers Longshot Cherkley Court, said: 'From our point of view the Court of Appeal judgement and the overwhelming support from the local community have only strengthened our resolve to deliver a project, of which Mole Valley residents can be justifiably proud.'

Yvonne Rees, chief executive of Mole Valley District Council, said: 'The appeal raised a number of important planning principles which are of significant interest to other planning authorities across the country.

'Such a decision reinforces the validity of the decision-making process that MVDC undertook.'

Shaun Spiers, chief executive of Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: 'This is a good day for millionaire golfers, and a very bad day for the countryside.

'CPRE Surrey and the Cherkley Campaign have fought a magnificent battle against the suburbanisation of some outstanding open countryside. It is a huge shame that on this occasion they have outgunned by the big battalions.'

In his judgement in the High Court, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave ruled that 'very exclusive private demand' was contrary to public need and highlighted the number of golf facilities already in the area.

In a statement today, Longshot Cherkley Court said: 'Lord
 Justices Richards, Underhill and Floyd unanimously agreed that Mr 
Justice Haddon-Cave’s quashing order and costs order should be set 
aside.

'The planning permission for the transformation of Cherkley Court has now been reinstated.

'LCC, having bought the site three years ago, looks forward to pressing ahead with its implementation, thereby enabling them to fully preserve and transform this precious site of historic and environmental importance.'

It added: 'Working closely with the local community, they are confident that Cherkley has an exciting future which will honour the building’s history, protects the precious landscape and ensures that this unique location is enjoyed by many people for many generations to come.

'The project will create up to 200 jobs across all the estate’s facilities and they will be looking to recruit at operational and management levels for the hotel, spa, health club, gardens, golf course and club house.

'Having already awarded the construction contract to the local company Wates, LCC will also be seeking where possible to employ local Mole Valley residents.'

Lord Beaverbrook was an influential press baron, owning The Daily Express, the Sunday Express and the London Evening Standard.

He was also a powerful politician, serving as a government minister during both World Wars.

Born Max Aitken in Maple, Ontario, Canada in 1879, he set up his first newspaper at the age of 13. The shrewd businessman made his fortune as a young man in Halifax and moved to Britain in 1910.

He quickly turned to politics and found candidacy as a Conservative, and then election, in Ashton-under-Lyme, in Manchester.

From 1911 he made overtures to buy the Daily Express in London, slowly increasing his stake in the newspaper from that year onwards. By 1916 he owned the paper outright.

It is widely believed he was a key player in the ousting of wartime Prime Minister Herbert Asquith and the rise of his replacement Lloyd George in 1916.

Later that year he was offered a peerage and chose the title Beaverbrook.

After resigning as Minister of Information, the 1920s and 1930s established Beaverbrook's reputation as a brilliant exponent of crusader politics.

In 1919, the Daily Express sold 400,000 copies a day. By 1938 it sold 2,329,000 and by 1960, 4,300,000.

He attracted criticism in the run up to the Second World War for his isolationist stance and defence of Russian leader Josef Stalin, but when he became minister of aircraft production by Winston Churchill, fighter and bomber production were immeasurably increased.

'This was his hour,' Churchill later declared.

After the war he travelled, wrote and engaged in charity work. He died in June 1964.
