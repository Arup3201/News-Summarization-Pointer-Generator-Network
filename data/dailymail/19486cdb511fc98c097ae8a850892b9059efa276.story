The tax-man would be Floyd Mayweather’s most dangerous opponent if his application for a license to promote in New York really were to mean him fighting there himself.

Marcos Maidana would be unlikely to inflict as much damage on Mayweather as the IRS if they were to take a mutual bite out of the Big Apple on September 13.

Speculation that Mayweather is planning to move that world title rematch from Las Vegas to the other city that never sleeps has been rife since that application was approved by the New York State Athletic Commission.

Money man: Floyd Mayweather has secured a license for New York but is unlikely to fight there himself

The far greater likelihood is that he is looking to New York as a venue for other boxers in the Mayweather Promotions stable now that he is severing links with Golden Boy.

Oscar De La Hoya’s company has been fronting Mayweather’s mega-bucks fights of late but a schism has followed the acrimonious departure of chief executive Richard Schaefer from Golden Boy.

Schaefer may well be hired by Mayweather to oversee his independent shows in the future, although De La Hoya is claiming that there is one fight remaining on the Golden Boy contract.

If that is enforceable, the pair would make uneasy bedfellows in September.

Although the man who calls himself Money
 would surely find that preferable to losing a sizeable chunk of the $50
 million-plus he can expect to bank for fighting Maidana again.

And that is what would happen if Mayweather boxed in either Madison Square Garden or the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

In addition to paying US income tax Mayweather would be liable for a further 8.82 per cent state deduction from his purse, plus four per cent New York City tax.

On a $50 million pay-night those state and city extras would cost him almost $6.5 million, while none of those additional levies are imposed on boxers by Nevada or Las Vegas.

The question is why would Mayweather do that, when he prefers fighting in his adopted home town in the desert anyway? Almost certainly the answer is that he won’t.

The MGM Grand Garden is his favourite work-place and is believed to have been reserved for him for the Mexico Independence celebration weekend, which always brings to Vegas thousands of high-rolling boxing afficionados from south of the border.

Expect it to remain so for another big Mexican holiday in May, when our own Amir Khan may finally get his shot at dethroning the pound-for-pound king.

Mayweather tends to delay not only hand-picking opponents but confirming the venue, presumably to crank up the site fee a little.

But when push comes to punch for this man, there is no place like home.

With the exquisite timing which hall-marked his halcyon years, Evander Holyfield announced his retirement on the 17th anniversary of having his ear bitten off by Mike Tyson, which came also during the weekend of the iron man’s 48th birthday.

The fortunes of these two immense champions are inextricably linked and despite that outrage in the Las Vegas ring they have become firm friends.

That bond has been strengthened by the way they both squandered hundreds of millions of dollars earned the hard way and are working to rebuild their lives.

The many mansions are long gone, with Holyfield having moved out of his answer to Buckingham Palace on the outskirts of Atlanta to a modest downtown apartment.

So are some of the wives, although both men continue to make provision for all their children, as best they can.

At 51, amid concerns about his tendency to sometimes slur his words, Holyfield’s belated hanging up of the gloves comes as something of a relief to the world of boxing.

Hopefully, the celebrity status built on his heroic exploits in the ring will provide a comfortable living hereafter.

In becoming the undisputed world champion at both cruiserweight and heavyweight Holyfield fought everyone, ducked no-one. In terms of the number of times one heavyweight has won the world title, he alone surpassed Muhammad Ali when he became champion a fourth time.

It would have been five had he not been robbed of a decision against Russian giant Nikolai Valuev, at the grand old age of 46.

Tyson, Larry Holmes, George Foreman, Buster Douglas and Britain’s greatest, Lennox Lewis, are but a few of the  huge names on Holyfield’s  resume. But it is the extraordinary  trilogy with Riddick Bowe - one  a Fight of the Year, one including the Round of the Year, one interrupted by the crash-landing of a para-glider in the open-air Vegas ring – which marked the summit of an epic career embracing 57 fights with 44 wins, 29 of them by knock-out.

Whoever nicknamed  Evnander Holyfield The Real Deal could foresee the future.

As Canelo Alvarez continues his comeback this Saturday from his solitary defeat by Floyd Mayweather he will not only be seeking victory over Erislandy Lara but looking to evict Mr Money from his country’s patriotic fight dates in Las Vegas.

While those September and May schedules are lucrative for Mayweather, Alvarez insiss they are more relevant for himself as the poster boy for Mexican boxing.

He hopes to put down a big marker to that effect with this fight in Mr Money’s favourite arena, the MGM Grand Garden.

Comeback: Canelo Alvarez (left during his only defeat to Mayweather) returns on Saturday against Erislandy Lara, and if he wins could also clash with Mayweather over preferred dates for his next bout in Vegas

Having despatched the tough Alfred Angulo with a tenth round stoppage in one light-middleweight non-title fight, the Cinammon Kid hopes to inflict something similar on Lara.

As it happens, a second convincing win in succession might even get him, like Marcos Maidana two months from now, a rematch with Mayweather.

Then they could both pack Sin City again – and in the process make another fortune in pesos as well as dollars.

Alvarez-Lara will be televised live on BoxNation late Saturday night.

So Kell Brook’s long-awaited world welterweight title challenge is scheduled at last – against America’s Shawn Porter in California in August.

It’s about time, gentlemen. No more injuries, Mr Brook, please.

Porter-Brook will be televised live on Sky Sports on August 16.

Finally: August 16 is the date locked in for Kell Brook's title challenge against American Shawn Porter
