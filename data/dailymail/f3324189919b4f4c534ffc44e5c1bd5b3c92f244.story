Best-selling Scottish author Ian Rankin has lashed out at Edinburgh Airport security after he was caught in a lengthy queue with other angry travellers.

The 54-year-old Inspector Rebus author vented his frustration on Twitter, where he complained about the airport’s ‘overrun’ system while he was delayed today.

In a tweet sent to the airport and his 80,000 followers, he wrote: ‘Hey, @EDI_Airport, one x-Ray machine in use at 7.30am? Having to lock passengers out because you're overrun? Embarrassing.’

Mr Rankin called the situation 'embarrassing' as he wrote to his 80,000 Twitter followers

Edinburgh Airport is currently trialling a new £25m security hall alongside its existing one.

This involves an ‘airlock system’ which allows some passengers through the new lounge, then closes the doors to allow other passengers through the old lounge.

Around 30 minutes after Mr Rankin published his angry tweet, the airport responded and denied his claim, saying: ‘We're currently testing our new security hall and running 2 halls. We have an airlock process so we can do that safely.’

It added: ‘We're not locking anyone out. Sorry your experience wasn't what you're used to. We'll be fully operational in the new hall soon.’

Mr Rankin wrote back: ‘Thanks for replying. Top of escalator, doors on left leading to security were locked. Passengers milling. Not a lockout?’

The Edinburgh-based author's tweets sparked a discussion with other passengers who complained about lengthy waits as the new security hall is trialled.

A Twitter user named Jourdan McC replied: ‘Been going on for a few weeks now. Total disaster! Has convinced me back to trains.’

Chris Hill added: ‘Happened  last time I took  early flight. Dozens of people stood in  corridor for no reason. Joke airport.’

Edinburgh West MP Mike Crockart said on Monday: ‘Shiny new security  looks lovely. Unfortunately takes 10x as long to get through.’

A picture uploaded to social media shows that queues have been a problem for some time.

The photograph, uploaded early last month, shows a long line of people with the caption ‘Edinburgh Airport enters “longest security queue” contest. 100 yards plus. Maybe a record.’

One customer review posted online on 14 November describes how a passenger missed their flight due to queuing at security.

A person who identified themselves as 'C Williams' wrote on Skytrax: ‘Despite being over an hour early for my flight, and only needing to go through security, I missed my plane. Edinburgh security used to be a dream. Now it's a nightmare.’

The new security facility is one and a half times larger than the current hall, and incorporates facial recognition and new hand luggage scanners.

The next development involves transforming the existent security hall into duty free shopping.

The busy airport had a record-breaking summer, with more than 1.1m travellers passing through the terminals in July alone.

The new security system has promised to ‘minimise the hassle and drastically cut queuing, potentially eliminating it altogether.’

Edinburgh Airport insists passengers are not being locked out of either security hall

Edinburgh Airport's trial of a new security hall has been branded a 'total disaster' by at least one traveller

A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: ‘We're currently in the process of transitioning between our old and new security halls. As a result of this, some passengers have experienced a slightly longer security process than we would like.

‘Passengers are not being locked out of either security hall. This is an air-lock process to allow us to run both areas safely.

‘We're working hard to ensure our security system works as efficiently as possible. We apologise if this has caused an inconvenience to our passengers and thank them for their continued patience.’

An online blog written last month by John Watson, chief commercial officer at Edinburgh Airport, says: ‘For the most part, trials have been going very well and we're on course to be officially opening and transitioning from the existing hall soon.

‘That said, we are grateful for the patience of our passengers, especially our regular ones, for the times we have had to manage technical teething issues.

‘I know the security team feel similarly frustrated but we all know that creating a security system of this level of passenger benefit will come with a few early learning problems.’
