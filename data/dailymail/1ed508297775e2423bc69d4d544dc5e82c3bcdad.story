The introduction of 5p plastic bag charge should be brought forward amid hopes it will drastically cut the number and raise £70million a year for good causes, say MPs.

Current Government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in England until October 2015 at the earliest.

However, MPs on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee (EFRA) say they are ‘disappointed’ at the delay and want a speedier launch.

Wales introduced a 5p charge in 
October 2011, while Northern Ireland followed suit in April 2013 and 
Scotland plans to do so in October this year.

However,
 David Cameron’s government has dragged its heels on implementing a 
charge, while it has also watered down the scheme for England, adding 
confusion and complexity.

In
 the other nations, the 5p charge applies to all single use bags and 
across all retailers, regardless of the size of the business and number 
of stores.

However, the 
charge in England will not apply to biodegradable or paper bags, while 
small shops employing less than 250 people will be exempt.

Conservation
 and anti-litter campaigns have criticised the complex regime for 
England, saying it will be less effective in controlling the litter and 
waste caused by the bags.

The big supermarkets are also 
critical, saying it will make their lives more difficult by having 
different rules for different parts of the UK.

Even
 the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents corner shops, 
say it would be better if there was a single uniform scheme of bag 
charges that also applied to its members.

The
 EFRA committee is currently carrying out a short inquiry into the 
adoption of the 5p bag charge in England, however it has separately 
published an annual review saying it should be brought forward.

The 11 man all-party committee is chaired by Conservative MP, Anne McIntosh, and includes five other Conservatives.

The review states: ‘Plastic bags are a major cause of seaborne pollution, and a serious hazard for marine life.

‘The
 Government estimates that in 2012, supermarkets gave out over eight 
billion single-use carrier bags across the UK, equating to approximately
 120 bags per person.

‘While
 the use of these plastic carrier bags in England has increased since 
2010, usage was cut dramatically by the Republic of Ireland after 
charges were introduced in 2002.

A similar charge in Northern Ireland has reduced carrier bag usage since April 2013. Supermarkets in Wales reported a drop in use of up to 76per cent after a charging scheme was brought in two years ago.’ 

They add: ‘We are pleased that the Government has finally agreed to impose a charge for single-use plastic carrier bags in supermarkets and larger food retailers.

However, we are disappointed that the charge will not come into effect in England until 2015, despite evidence of its success in reducing plastic carrier bag usage in other parts of the UK and Ireland. 

‘Reducing the number of single-use carrier bags which are given away is a quick win: reducing both waste and environmental pollution with little effort.

‘Given the evidence elsewhere, we recommend the early introduction of the charge.’ 

Environment minister, Dan Rogerson, recently told MPs that the 5p for plastic bags will cut usage by 60-80 per cent and so vastly reduce pollution and litter.

The resulting reduction in carbon emissions would be the equivalent of permanently taking up to 2.8million cars off the road, he said.

The proceeds from the levy, which comes as victory for the Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign, will be given to good causes.

Community organisations and charities will get up to £70million a year to deal with the impact of plastic pollution on wildlife and the environment.

Litter policy expert at the Marine Conservation Society, Dr Sue Kinsey, criticised the delay and complexity of the bag charging scheme planned for England.

‘Some totally superfluous and unhelpful exemptions have been brought in, which will cause confusion to retailers and consumers alike,’ she said.

She said the exemptions for paper bags and biodegradable bags are not justified, while the decision not to require charges at small stores is ‘very worrying’.

‘This could cause major confusion and headaches for retailers and for customers who won’t recognise what kind of business  they are shopping in. Surely giving a level playing field to all retailers is beneficial,’ said Dr Kinsey.

‘We have a well understood and popular system already bedded in and working well in Wales. Having a different system in England is totally unnecessary and can only cause confusion all round.’
