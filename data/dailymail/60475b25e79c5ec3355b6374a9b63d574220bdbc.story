At age 12, Martin Pistorius suddenly turned from a healthy boy obsessed with electronics into a virtual 'vegetable' after falling into an inexplicable comatose state.

He would spend the next dozen years trapped inside his weakened, helpless body, unable to speak or move, with only the children's character Barney to keep him company for hours on end.

'I cannot even express to you how much I hated Barney,' Martin recalled on the first episode of NPR's new radio show about human behavior, Invisibilia.

But according to Martin, it was his burning desire to get away from the affable purple dinosaur prancing with kids on the television screen in a South African clinic that gave him the impetus to get better.

In a bid to gain some control of his day, Martin figured a way to tell time by tracking the movement of the sun across the room.

Four years into his mystery illness, he started to regain consciousness and mobility, until eventually he learned to operate a computer to type messages and speak through a speech synthesizer.

In 2011, Martin wrote a book about his extraordinary journey, which fortunately had a happy end: he met a woman in 2008 and the two got married and moved to the UK a year later.

The same year Martin's autobiography, Ghost Boy, was released, he wrote a poignant first-person account for the Daily Mail detailing his illness and remarkable recovery.

In January 1988, when Martin Pistorius was 12 years old, he came home from school one day with a sore throat. He never returned to class.

Fed up: Martin was stuck in front of a TV set watching reruns of Barney (right) for days on end, until one day he decided he's had enough. He started following the movement of the sun in the room to tell time

Buried alive: Pistorius recalled feeling entombed in his weak, out-of-control body, even as his mind continued to churn out thoughts that he could not communicate 

In the months that followed, his condition deteriorated. Doctors were never able to conclusively pinpoint the exact cause of his ailment, but cryptococcal meningitis was the most likely culprit.

His mobility was the first to go, followed by his memory, leaving him an empty shell of his old self.

‘My muscles wasted, my limbs became spastic, my hands and feet curled in on themselves like claws,’ he wrote for Daily Mail. ‘I was completely unresponsive. I was in a virtual coma but the doctors couldn’t diagnose what had caused it.’

After months of tests and doctor visits, Martin's parents, Rodney and Joan Pistorius, were told that nothing can be done for him, and that the only option was to put their son in a home and let his degenerative neurological mystery illness run its course.

'Politely but firmly the medical profession washed its hands of me. We were in effect told to wait until my death released us all,' he wrote.

Speaking to NPR's Invisibilia from his home in Harlow, England, Pistorius said his darkest hour came when his mother entered into his room and told him, 'I hope you die.'

Joan Pistorius said she uttered those pitiless words thinking her vegetable-like son could not hear her. But he did.

Against all odds, Martin continued living.

For the next decade, his father's life consisted of getting up early in the morning, driving his helpless son to a special care center, then picking him up eight hours later and driving him home, where he would be bathed, fed and put to bed.

His mother initially wanted nothing to do with Martin, so great was her anger and resentment brought on by seeing her once-healthy boy turn into a 'potted plant.'

At one point during those dark days, Joan Pistorius even tried to take her own life by overdosing on pills, but her husband was able to get her to the hospital in time.  

What Joan and Rodney did not know was that about two years into their son’s ailment, his mind 'switched on.'

'I began to wake up,' Pistorius, now age 39, told NPR, explaining that all of a sudden he was aware of 'everything.'  

No one around Martin knew that he had regained his mental faculties because he still could not move his body or express himself verbally.

He was effectively trapped, and there was no way to escape.

In his lengthy account from 2011, Martin wrote: ‘Though my body and I were locked in an endless fight, my mind was getting stronger. Pieces of my consciousness knitted together.

‘I gradually became aware of each day and each hour in it. Most were forgettable but there were times I saw history unfold. Mandela becoming president in 1994 is a hazy memory but Diana’s death in 1997 is clear.

‘I knew who I was and where I was, and understood I’d been robbed of a real life.

Love at first smile: In 2008, Pistorius met a social worker named Joanna, who said she was instantly drawn to his sense of humor 

‘I was completely entombed. At first I wanted to fight my fate by leaving some tiny sign to guide people back to me, like the crumbs Hansel and Gretel left to help find their way out of the woods.

‘Have you ever seen one of those movies in which someone wakes up as a ghost but they don’t know that they’ve died? That’s how it was, as I realized people were looking through and around me.

‘However much I tried to beg and plead, shout and scream, I couldn’t make them notice me.’

Martin recalled that while most of the staff at the special care clinic he was in were kind to him, some were callous and cruel, calling him an 'obstacle' and 'rubbish' to his face, not realizing that he could hear and understand ever hurtful word.  

Martin's first impulse was to turn off his thoughts, since he saw no point in having them in the first place.

‘You don't really think about anything,’ Martin said. ‘You simply exist. It's a very dark place to find yourself because, in a sense, you are allowing yourself to vanish.’

But then something changed inside him. After learning to tell time by the sun just so he could escape the endless Barney reruns on TV, Martin slowly regained his will to live, in part thanks to a kindly special care worker who took a genuine interest in him. 

At age 26, Martin passed a test by identifying pictures of various items with his eyes.

Joan, his mother, quit her job as a radiographer and spent the next two years helping Martin master a computer program that enabled him to communicate.

Fresh start: Martin and Joanna have moved to Harlow, UK, where the wheelchair-bound 39-year-old works as a web designer

Sealed with a kiss: In 2009, the couple got married.Te two are shown here on their wedding day 

'My feeble hands pressing one of my switches enabled me to choose a word I wanted. Then I would click on one last symbol – ‘speak’ – and my electronic voice would have its say,' he wrote in 2011.

Still wheelchair-bound and unable to speak normally, Martin went on to get a job at a government office.

But he was not done yet. Pistorius then enrolled in a university to study computer science and eventually started his own company. He is now learning to drive.

In 2008, Martin's life took yet another sudden turn, only this time for the better: he met a social worker named Joanna.

A friend of Martin's sister, Joanna said she was instantly drawn to Martin's sense of humor. For Martin and Joanna, it was love at first smile.

'My face would hurt form smiling so much,' Martin told NPR through his voice synthesizer.
