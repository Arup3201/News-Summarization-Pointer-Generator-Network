Facebook has launched the first 'couples pages' allowing people to chronicle their relationship on the site.

They bring together every event attended together, every picture and every post onto one page.

However, singletons shouldn't feel left out - Facebook has also revealed a similar service for friends.

Facebook's new friendship pages, which show pictures, events and mutual friends on a single page

Friendship pages are being rolled out to all users from today.

To see them, visit a friend's page and click on the gear symbol in the top right.

If you've listed yourself as in a relationship with someone, you can also visit facebook.com/us to see your 'couples page'

The social networking giant says the 
new pages will allow users to see exactly which moments and pictures 
they have shared with friends on a single page.

'Starting today, we're introducing a new layout for friendship pages,' said Facebook's Arun Vijayvergiya.

'Friendship pages combine posts, photos and events that you and another person have shared.

'Click the gear menu at the top of a friend's timeline to see a friendship page.

'If you've listed yourself as in a relationship with someone, you can also visit facebook.com/us to see the friendship page you share with that person.'

However, some users have warned the new pages could cause problems.

'It doesn’t appear that there is a way for users to block friends or acquaintances from creating these pages about them,' wrote Shane McGlaun of website SlashGear.

'If a jealous girlfriend sees that a page has been created with your name and an ex-girlfriend’s name at the same event, your life is likely to get difficult.'

The new pages also allow people to share their couples page, sending it to friends and family.
