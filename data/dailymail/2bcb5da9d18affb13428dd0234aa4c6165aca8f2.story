A large bird's nest mostly made from scrap metal has been removed from a pylon in Fuzhou, capital of southeast China's Fujian Province. 

The one-metre in diameter giant metal nest was built by a red-billed Blue Magpie couple on one arm of the pylon due to a lack of trees in the nearby area. 

To create the nest they used materials, mostly made of metal, pilfered from the construction material market beneath the pylon.

However, the market management office was afraid that debris falling from the nest may hurt pedestrians below and contracted the local power grid company and a local zoo to come and help.

The power company initially sent one worker up carrying basket on their back, but the nest proved to be too large and heavy and another worker went to help.

During the removal of the nest, the magpie couple kept pecking the intruding workers as there were a number of chicks in the nest.

The chicks were sent to Fuzhou Birds Forest Zoo where they will be reared by keepers before being released back into the wild.
