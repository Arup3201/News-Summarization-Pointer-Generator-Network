Leaked carbon dioxide piped through to a drinks fountain was behind the 
fumes breathed in by a woman in McDonald's who later died, police said.

Anne Felton, 80, of Ponte Vedra, Florida, was among 10 people who fell 
ill from the incident at the restaurant in Pooler, Georgia, last week.

She later died after being found unconscious in a bathroom with 
another woman - while other people in the restaurant struggled to 
breathe.

A leaky gas line between the walls caused the gas - used to pump 
carbonation into sodas - to build up a week ago, investigators said.

‘It caused what is normally a harmless gas to be pumped into the wall 
cavity and leak into the women's restroom,' Pooler Police Chief Mark 
Revenew said. ‘At a high level of concentration, it displaces oxygen.’

Firefighters were called on September 7 to the restaurant in Pooler and two women were found unconscious in a bathroom.

They were later admitted to hospital, where eight others from the 
restaurant were treated and released. Ms Felton died the next day.

Three fire fighters were among those needing hospital treatment after

Investigators initially suspected people fell ill to noxious fumes from cleaning chemicals.

An autopsy found no trace of chemicals in Ms Felton - but it indicated she succumbed to suffocation, Chief Revenew said.

She was eating a McDonald's meal with her husband at the time of the tragedy.

The restaurant's franchisees, John and Monique Palmaccio, said they are ‘committed to running safe, welcoming restaurants’.

'We worked closely with the authorities to determine the cause of this 
incident and we've taken action to correct the situation'

‘We worked closely with the authorities to determine the cause of this 
incident and we've taken action to correct the situation,’ they said in a statement.

The police chief said the owners had replaced the soda fountain's gas 
lines and valves and were allowed to reopen the restaurant.

‘At this point we don't anticipate criminal charges,’ Chief Revenew added. ‘It just appears to be a mistake.’

The U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration is also investigating, looking into possible workplace safety violations.
