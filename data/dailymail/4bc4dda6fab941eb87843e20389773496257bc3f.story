Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy has underlined his ambition to make a late push for the Premier League by signing free-scoring Leicester City striker Chris Wood on loan.

McCarthy has exceeded expectations by taking an Ipswich team that cost £10,000 to assemble into an unlikely play-off place.

But with just seven points separating the top seven clubs in the Championship, owner Marcus Evans has loosened the purse strings to allow McCarthy to sign Wood on loan, a 23-year-old New Zealand international who has scored 57 goals in 114 starts for seven different clubs including West Brom and Birmingham City.

Mick McCarthy has taken Ipswich to third in the Championship, and is desperate for promotion

His only goal this season came when Leicester drew 2-2 with Everton on the opening day. Since then, Nigel Pearson has mainly opted to play David Nugent, Jamie Vardy and new signings Andrej Kramaric and Leonardo Ulloa up front.

Ipswich are also interested in taking midfielder Anthony Knockaert on loan from Leicester but have to persuade the player to drop down a division.

The Suffolk side are currently third in the Championship table. McCarthy is desperate for another crack at the Premier League having been sacked by Wolves in February 2012 when they were fighting relegation in the top flight. The club ended up going down but McCarthy privately believed he could have kept them up had he been given the opportunity.
