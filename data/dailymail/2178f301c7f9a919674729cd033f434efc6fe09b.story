Dyson has applied for a patent for a wash basin with taps that can not only spout water but also blow hot air to dry your hands.

The innovative British company, already famous for its vacuum cleaners and Airblade hand driers, outlined the design in an application to the U.S. Patent Office.

While some public toilets already include integrated systems where visitors can wash their hands and dry them in the same place, Dyson's innovation appears to be making both the water and the air come from one mechanism.

All in one: Dyson has applied to patent a new device that would integrate taps with a hand drier, allowing people to wash their hands and dry them without moving away from the sink

In US patent application 2012/0291195, filed last week, the Malmesbury, Wiltshire-based company explains how the unit is operated by sensors which will release water from the underside of a spout.

When users finish washing their hands a further pair of sensors recognise when they place each hand beneath a pair of ducts which then activate the drier to blow hot air to dry them off.

The invention is an advance on the 
traditional set up which forces toilet goers to wash at a sink, then 
walk with dripping hands to a wall-mounted drier, where there may be a 
queue.

Sir James Dyson: The filing is likely to create a buzz since Dyson has since its inception been associated with clever and clean design and engineering

It doesn't move on far from the increasingly common washbasin with integrated drier set up. It is simply, as Dyson asserts in their patent application, their first dual purpose fixture that combines both functions.

The filing is nevertheless likely to create a buzz since Dyson has since its inception by inventor James Dyson with his bagless vacuum cleaner been associated with clever and clean design and engineering.

The filing, filed on May 17, proposes a 'dual-purpose fixture for a sink or wash basin, incorporating both a water tap and a hand dryer'.

It says: 'The water tap has a spout arranged to project over the basin of the sink, and the hand dryer incorporates two or more hand-dryer nozzlesâ€”at least one for each of a user's hands.

'The left-hand nozzle is located on the left-hand side of the spout and the right-hand nozzle is located on the right-hand side of the spout, specifically so that the spout acts as a dividing partition between the two hand-dryer nozzles.

'This encourages correct usage of the hand-dryer. The fixture may be fitted to a sink or wall-mounted above the sink.'
