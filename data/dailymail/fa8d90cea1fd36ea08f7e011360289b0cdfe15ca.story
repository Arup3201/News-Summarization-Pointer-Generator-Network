A simple picture of your loved one could become a thing of the past as a new 3D printing service is immortalising people like never before.

The pioneering technology is able to capture and then 'print' 3D figurine versions of people, and even animals, in unbelievably realistic detail.

After surrounding the subject in a dome of 60 to 80 DSLR cameras, they are then triggered to take a picture simultaneously, creating a complete 360 degree image.

Mini-me: A company in Texas, U.S., is creating replica models of customers using pioneering 3D printing techniques. The models are between six and 15 inches tall, as shown by one client

Using a 'sandstone printing method' the printer lays down a fine layer of gypsum powder, also known as calcium sulphate, to which a binding agent and dye is added.

This process is then repeated thousands of times to construct the lifelike models.

Advances in 3D printing have been making headlines around the world, with the new technology being used for to build life-saving medical devices, form scaffolds for medical implants, create new fashion items and accessories and even print miniature micro batteries furthering the realms of science.

The method has also been used, however, to 'print' parts of a gun, raising serious questions about the ethics and regulation of the use of the new technology.

3D printing service 'Captured Dimensions' based in Texas, USA, is offering a far less questionable service, however, for those who want to see what they look like to others. 

Captured: After surrounding the subject in a dome of 60 to 80 DSLR cameras, printing specialists then trigger the cameras simultaneously, creating a complete 360 degree image

Final product: Using a 'sandstone printing method' the printer lays down a fine layer of gypsum powder, also known as calcium sulphate, to which a binding agent and dye is added

Special moment:  The novel way of capturing a moment is proving popular with brides and grooms, and new families

Useful: Some couples have even decorated their own wedding cakes with models of themselves

Since the service began, they have seen a whole new market unfold with the creation of the technology, they say.

They deal with requests ranging from 
family pets to tiny brides and grooms and even new parents wanting a 
miniature model of the new addition to their family.

Replica figurines cost around $450 and range from around six to 15 inches (15-38cm) tall.

Company founder Jordan Williams, 27, said: '3D printing is so amazing because it opens the door to all kinds of creativity and innovation, more so than any other production method, it is truly going to change the world.

'This is an industry in which you can never really say "We've arrived, we've done it," there is always something to improve and innovate on, it's all changing so fast.

Comedy: While most have opted for happy moments to be captured, this couple were re-created in a mock argument

New additions to a family are also proving popular subjects, to be immortalised as infants

'Since I've been following 3D Printing, which is nearly four years now, the technology has improved so rapidly in some areas that I can hardly believe it.

'We get a great range of responses from "that's creepy" to "that is the coolest thing I have ever seen.

'Overall, people love what we are doing and want to get involved.'
