Could the handbag be man's new best friend? A new study reveals that sales of 'man-bags' are up 143 per cent over the past three months.

And tellingly, only 20 per cent of the nation's men feel self-conscious about the trend as the stigma attached to carrying a handbag for their essentials finally disappears.

Research carried out by eBay.co.uk shows that the
fail-safe rucksack, favoured by stylish celebrities such as Ryan Gosling, remains the
most popular style for men, with practicality being the primary reason men
had for needing a bag.

A chunky holdall is the second most popular style (35 per cent) and the messenger bag (30 per cent) came in third.

The messenger/cross body bag was the favoured style among Essex lads, possibly taking inspiration from local style
icon Joey Essex, who is often seen sporting one.

Never ones to sacrifice vanity for practicality, one in three Essex boys use their man bag to carry toiletries and beauty equipment,
including fake tan, tweezers and aftershave.

Men
from London are more pragmatic when it comes
to their bag of choice. 65 per cent of Londoners opt for the rucksack,
with 60 per cent using theirs to carry work documents and 45 per cent are 
using their tote to carry tech equipment like laptops, tablets and MP3 
players.

Perhaps the 
most surprising news, though, is that one in five (20 per cent) of men 
in the North West picked the retro bumbag as their accessory of choice. 
eBay.co.uk saw a 253 per cent
rise in sales of these hands-free bags on the site in the last three months alone.

Functionality is key to this style with over 50 per cent using theirs solely to
carry essential items such as phones, keys and wallets.

A spokesman for eBay said: 'Bags are just as important to men as they are
for women and with functionality being the top reason for purchase. Rucksacks
clearly remain the popular style and are a good way to ease yourself into the
man-bag trend.'

The
metrosexual male is finally mainstream: women now expect their
other halves to regularly make use of a beauty regime, according to new
research.

Over
half of men (53 per cent) admit to frequently preening and using beauty
products to improve their appearance, according to The Co-operative Pharmacy. This is a dramatic shift away from traditional
male behaviours in the ascendant when the term ‘metrosexual’ was coined almost 20 years ago.

Beautification methods used run the gamut, with one in seven men (15 per cent) plucking
or waxing unruly eyebrows, seven per cent wearing concealer to cover up a spot and one in
20 (five per cent) using fake tan.

Almost a third of men work out and around
one in 14 (eight per cent) use protein powder to increase their size.

Younger men aged between 18-24 are more
likely to use extreme measures to improve their looks including using steroids
illegally to put on muscle, with six per cent of this age group admitting to such behaviour. Men aged 25-34 were the biggest users of slimming pills (5
per cent). 

Almost two thirds of men said they
undertake their beauty regime to make themselves feel better and to boost their
confidence levels. More than a quarter believe in taking pride in their
appearance and around one in 6 (17 per cent) are trying to look younger.

Some men are attempting to improve their image out of regard for their partner (almost one in 10), or because of pressure from other male friends to look good (12 per cent). 9 per cent
blame it on media influence. 

Women are more accepting than men when
it comes to attitudes towards male beautification. Over half of females (52
per cent) think that it is alright for men to pluck or wax their eyebrows
compared to a third of men (34 per cent) and, when questioned, almost two in
five women (38 per cent) thought it was fine for men to wear fake tan, compared
to just 30 per cent of men. 

In
addition, women are more open to men adopting techniques typically classed as
female grooming activity, like using concealer; 45 per cent of women
believe that this is socially acceptable, while 47 per cent of men do not.

However,
men were more likely than women to find using steroids or protein powder to
bulk up acceptable, with 23 per cent of males saying it was fine to use steroids
and 44 per cent thinking it was alright to use protein formula.

Men, it seems, are willing to pay large sums for their looks. One
third said that they would spend up to £50 on a beauty treatment to make
them look and feel better each month.

The research also found that on average, men
were prepared to pay £346 for a one-off treatment during the course of a year
to make themselves feel better.

Body image expert and campaigner Natasha Devon said, 'I've noticed that there's been a major attitude shift in men under the age of 25 and there's more pressure on men now to "take care of themselves".

'I think it's great that men now have the freedom to experiment with how they look, but we have to learn from what's historically happened to women – with beauty and grooming can come a lot of insecurity, if it's not presented and handled in the right way.

'Men need to resist the pressure to conform to an identical look. They should seek to take control and make their own rules.'
