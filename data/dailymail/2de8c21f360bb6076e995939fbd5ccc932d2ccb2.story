Abel Hernandez became Hull City’s club-record signing when he joined for £9.5million on deadline day.

The Uruguay striker penned a three-year deal at the KC Stadium but his arrival was somewhat overshadowed by the subsequent scramble to sign Newcastle’s Hatem Ben Arfa.

So who is Hernandez? And what will he bring to the Tigers? Sportsmail tells you more…

New arrival: Abel Hernandez completed a £9.5m club-record move to Hull City from Palermo on deadline day

First things first, what are the basics?

Well, he only turned 24 last month so his best years should still be ahead of him. Born in Pando on the country’s coast, he made his debut at 16 with Central Espanol in the second tier.

A transfer to current Uruguayan champions Penarol soon followed and he didn’t hang around there for too long either, moving to Serie A and Palermo when still only 18.

New surroundings: Hernandez arrives at the KC Stadium with a good reputation but has yet to fulfil it fully

So he’s had nearly six years in Italy, was he a success?

On the whole, yes, although his stay was bookended by periods of promise with some frustrating times in between.

He spent his early months in the youth-team ranks but come the age of 19 he was a regular in the first-team set-up. Indeed, his first full season produced seven league goals from 21 appearances.

But his strike-rate dropped and, over the next three seasons, he managed only 10 from 56 outings. He contributed only one goal as Palermo were relegated in 2013. Last season, however, undoubtedly won him his move to the Premier League, 14 league goals meaning he signed off with a one-in-two ratio as the Rosanero returned to Serie A as champions.

Promise: Hernandez has been billed as the next big thing for years but he is yet to fully fulfil his potential

But that was Serie B, is that not a concern?

Perhaps, but the season in a lower league appears to have given him the platform to rediscover his form and fitness and at least he arrives full of confidence.

Decent record: Hernandez netted 14 times for Palermo as they were promoted from Serie B last season

What about at international level?

He’s competing with former Palermo team-mate Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez for a starting berth, and as a result he was restricted to just 39 minutes at the World Cup.

But he has 14 caps and seven goals – four of which came in an 8-0 win over Tahiti – and in the absence of Suarez he could be set for a run in the national side.

Prolific: Hernandez's record at international level is impressive, having netted seven times in 14 appearances

So what type of player is he?

He’s 6ft1ins but Hernandez is more pace than power. If Nikica Jelavic is the targetman at Hull, then the new boy will buzz around him, populating the flanks when given license.

Manager Steve Bruce has already labelled him an ‘exciting talent’ who ‘supporters will enjoy watching’. Hernandez is nicknamed ‘The Jewel’, and Bruce will certainly be hoping he’s struck gold.

Quick: Hernandez is more about pace than power and can thrive alongside Nikica Jelvaic up front for Hull

Will he be a success with Hull then?

You’d argue they have upgraded on Shane Long and saved themselves £2m in the process. He needs to improve his potency in front of goal but his pace will also create chances for others. But, at 24, time is on his side and we think Hull have made a smart investment.

Good deal? Hull have sold Shane Long to Southampton, signed Abel Hernandez and saved £2m in the process
