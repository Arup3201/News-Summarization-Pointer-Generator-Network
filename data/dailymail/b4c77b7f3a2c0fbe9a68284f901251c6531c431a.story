Thomas Muller was the star of the show for Germany in their opening match of the World Cup as his hat-trick did for Portugal in a resounding 4-0 victory.

The Bayern Munich man was again deployed as a lone frontman for Saturday’s second Group G encounter with Ghana in Fortaleza.

But could he repeat his scoring heroics and move clear at the top of the goal-getters chart?

Sportsmail tracked his progress throughout the game…

Making his point: Thomas Muller scored three as Germany opened their World Cup with a 4-0 win over Portugal

Red alert: A stoppage-time collision with Boye left Muller bloodied and dazed in the 2-2 draw with Ghana

Care: Muller is tended to by team-mate Miroslav Klose following the late clash

Nasty: Muller's bloody palm shows the extent of his injury

5mins – Muller comes deep to collect possession after a subdued start and, after laying off a short pass to Philpp Lahm on halfway, he waves his arms in frustration towards his team-mates.

10mins – Muller, socks rolled mid shin, continues to cut an isolated figure in attack and his best work has come in chasing and hassling Ghana’s defenders, who seem content to stroke the ball around in their own third.

11mins – At last there is a sight at goal for Muller inside the area but, rather than pull the trigger, he decides to unselfishly roll a clever back-heel into Toni Kroos’ path only for his low blast to be blocked on the penalty spot. Muller’s deft touch showed great presence of mind and created the first real opening of the contest.

Scraps: Muller made a quiet start to the game and chances were at a premium early on

Hunger: The Germany striker was forced out wide in his pursuit of possession

18mins – Mesut Ozil escapes down the right but, with Muller lurking at the back post and anticipating the cross, the Arsenal midfielder opts instead to tee up Sami Khedira on the edge of the area and his shot is smothered by Ghana goalkeeper Fatau Dauda. Again Muller is not shy to remonstrate with his team-mate.

21mins – Perhaps wary of his ticking off, Ozil again scampers clear down the right and this time slides towards the near post where Muller is steaming in. The German wins his foot race with his minder but a low poke is forced wide by the recovering defender. His hunger for the goal was evident, however, and you get the feeling he is desperate to add to his three-goal haul from the opening game.

35mins – Ghana’s emergence in the game means Muller’s involvement has subsided and his frustration is evident when another Ozil cross fails to find his boot. He’s yet to register an effort on goal himself.

Denied: Muller steals in at the near post but is thwarted by sliding defender John Boye

Frustration: Muller's angst is evident as he is denied at the near post

40mins – Muller finds himself forced wide but two crosses in quick succession fail to locate a comrade inside the area – if only he was there to get on the end of his own delivery.

43mins – John Boye lands a hefty blow on the back of Muller’s head but, unlike his theatrics against Portugal during the incident which led to Pepe’s red card, the German bounces back to his feet and acknowledges the accidental nature of the defender’s challenge.

Pain game: Muller is clattered by Ghana defender Boye

HALF-TIME: Germany 0 Ghana 0 – A frustrating half for Muller who has been let down by the final delivery of his team-mates but also well marshalled by a resilient Ghana.

51mins – GOAL: GERMANY 1 GHANA 0 – Marksman Muller turns provider as he is afforded space outside of the area to pick an expert cross and Mario Gotze gladly gets on the end of the pinpoint delivery to head his side into the lead.

Super Mario: Muller congratulates Mario Gotze having supplied the cross for his team-mate to head the opener

55mins – GOAL: GERMANY 1 GHANA 1 – The advantage lasts less than four minutes and it is midfielder Andre Ayew who ghosts into the danger zone to head beyond Manuel Neuer from 12 yards.

63mins – GOAL: GERMANY 1 GHANA 2 – Muller can only watch on from 60 yards away as Lahm’s sloppy pass is seized upon and Asamoah Gyan is sprung clear before finishing with authority.

68mins - Ghana are bossing matters and Muller is not getting a sniff as Germany find themselves penned inside their own half.

Shock: Muller and Ozil prepare to restart with Ghana having taken a 2-1 lead

70mins - There is a momentary scare for Muller as his number is mistakenly shown by the fourth official with Miroslav Klose and Bastian Schweinsteiger preparing to enter. The error is soon rectified and Muller remains.

71mins - GOAL: GERMANY 2 GHANA 2 - Within a minute of his arrival Klose pounces to draw Germany level, toeing home from two yards out after Bendikt Howedes had flashed Kroos' corner towards goal. The strike took Klose level with Brazil's Ronaldo on a record 15 World Cup goals.

77mins - Klose's introduction means Muller has been moved out to the right-hand channel but still he is trying to time his runs into the penalty area as Germany press for a winner.

85mins -  At last Muller has the clear-cut opening he has craved as Kroos slips him through on goal. The Bayern man steadies himself but, before dispatching his shot, the sliding Asamoah lunges to steal from the toe of the forward and nicks clear for a corner.

Unlucky 13: Kwadwo Asamoah slides to deny Muller after he was sprung clear on goal

90mins - Muller finishes the match in a bloodied mess after his head crashes into the shoulder of Boye when attempting to get on the end of a Kroos free-kick. He was still being tended to by medics as his team-mates made their way from the pitch.

FULL-TIME: GERMANY 2 GHANA 2 - A thrilling contest ends all square but for Muller it proved a frustrating night. His one clear sight at goal was snuffed out by a brilliant recovering challenge from Asamoah but he did lay on the opening goal for Mario Gotze. He remains joint top of the scoring charts on three but was unable to edge himself in front.
