A record number of Britons are now saving into a work pension, official figures show.

Six in 10 people are now saving into a workplace pension pot, up from half three years ago.

The rapid increase means there are now 2.7million more people in pensions than just 12 months earlier, bringing the total to 15.7million.

This is the highest level since records began in 1997, and follows a Government scheme launched in 2012 which forces employers to enrol staff into a pension.

The worker can then opt out of this, although few have.

The latest pension figures show that this automatic enrolment has helped to reverse a long-term decline in people taking out pensions.

However, the annual survey from the Office for National Statistics also showed that fewer workers were being offered gold-plated final salary pensions than ever before.

These valuable schemes now represent less than half of all workplace pensions – the first time this has occurred since records began.

The figures also showed that public sector workers received far higher contributions from their employer than private sector staff, meaning they will retire on far more generous pensions.

Minister for Pensions, Steve Webb, said: 'The rise in the proportion of people saving for retirement over the past three years is stunning. Pension saving is now at its highest level since records began.

'This is due in no small part to the success of automatic enrolment which is changing the culture of pension saving in Britain.

'Millions more people are now saving into a workplace pension, allowing them to build a decent nest egg to enjoy in their retirement, on top of a reinvigorated new State Pension.'
