Prisoners at a jail notorious for riots and unrest are being given pets in a bid to keep them calm.

Dogs, rabbits and guinea pigs are being cared for by inmates at the Â£150 million HMP Oakwood near Wolverhampton to provide them with 'a sense of   responsibility'.

They are allowed to feed, clean out the animals and take them for walks in the grounds, but they are not allowed to take them back to their cells.

Prisoners were in a nine-hour stand-off with guards in January at Oakwood, run by G4S and nicknamed 'Jokewood' for its alleged lax security.

Reports at the time claimed up to 40 inmates had taken two guards hostage during the riot - before demanding McDonald's meals were brought to their   cells.

Yet G4S and the Ministry of Justice dismissed these claims as 'completely untrue'.

One of Britain's largest with 1,600 inmates, Oakwood Prison was described as a model for future prisons by the government yet has been beset by   controversy.

Yet the animal therapy scheme has been has been greeted with some cynicism.

A source in the prison told the Sunday Mirror: 'How on Earth can it be right that dangerous inmates are being treated to their own furry friends?

'It is bizarre to say the least but the idea is that animals have a soothing effect on the most disturbed inmates.

'After the riot earlier in the year it seems they will try anything to calm the inmates down.'

In October inspectors gave it a damning report - quoting one prisoner who said drugs were easier to get hold of than basics like soap.

A G4S spokesperson said: 'Animal therapy a common technique used to develop a sense of responsibility and ownership for prisoners.

'That is why we have   a number of small animals, including two rescued greyhound dogs that are kept in kennels.'

Although prisoners have been allowed to keep pets since as far back as 1792, animal therapy was first used in America in the late 1980s and has spread   throughout the world.
