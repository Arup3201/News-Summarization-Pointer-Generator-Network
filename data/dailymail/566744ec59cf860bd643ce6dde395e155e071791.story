The daughter-in-law of Nike's co-founder sent a 17-year-old student naked photos of herself and asked if he wanted to have sex, court documents have revealed.

Melissa Bowerman, 43, was arrested at
 her home in Fossil, Oregon on Monday after police received a tip 
earlier this month that she'd been involved with an inappropriate 
relationship with a teenager.

Now a probable cause affidavit has detailed her alleged advances, including asking the boy to send pictures of his genitals to her and kissing him in the locker room at the school where she is a coach.

She is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with the boy, a student on the track team at Madras High School, between May and June.

The teen told police that Bowerman 
had contacted him over social media and the conversation eventually turned sexual, The Oregonian 
reported.

She allegedly sent him naked photos of herself and asked him to masturbate, the teen said.

In
 return, she asked for him to send a photo of his genitals but he sent 
one from the internet instead, claiming it was him, he told cops.

When
 she asked him if he wanted to have sex, he said no - and she conceded that they 
would have to wait until he was 18 anyway, the affidavit said.

But their relationship did get physical, according to the court documents.

Following
 an awards event, Bowerman drove the teen home and he rubbed her stomach
 and grabbed her breast - making her smile - the boy said.

Married woman: Bowerman has been married to the Nike founder's son, Jon, for six years. They were previously forced to leave a coaching position after she went to prom with a student

He also told cops that he later willingly kissed the track coach in the locker room and she smacked him on the buttocks as they left.

Their alleged affair was
 uncovered by a relative of Bowerman's who saw their Facebook messages. In one, Bowerman said that the boy had promised to 
love her but had dumped her, and she told him she loved him, the affidavit 
said.

The relative handed over the messages to authorities in early July and the teenager was interviewed a week later.

Officers
 arrested Bowerman on Monday and searched her home, where they found the
 boy's track jersey and a comforter that had appeared in the naked 
photos, The Oregonian reported.

During
 questioning, she initially insisted the boy had kissed her against her 
will and had forcibly put his hands down her pants. But she later 
admitted to sending the photos of herself and talking with him about 
having sex.

She was charged with using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, second-degree sex abuse and luring a minor. She will be arraigned on Friday.

The arrest comes two years after Bowerman was dismissed as a volunteer track coach at another school in Oregon for
 taking a 17-year-old student to the prom.

She had insisted
 there had been no inappropriate relations and she said she went to the prom with the teenager because he 
felt bad that he had no date and had been struggling in English class.

New allegations: The latest accusations claim she sexually abused a teenage student at Madras High School in Oregon, pictured, where she has been a track coach for two years

 County Sheriff Gary Bettencourt, who had received a complaint from a 
chaperone, said he found no evidence that Melissa Bowerman broke the 
law in the 2012 incident.

Still,
 she was dismissed and moved to coach at Madras High School. After staff
 kept a close eye on her, she was promoted to head coach, the Oregonian 
reported.

Bowerman's husband of six years, 76-year-old Jon Bowerman, the son of late Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman, told The Oregonian he is shocked by her arrest but that she has his support.

He said police served a search warrant at their home 
in Fossil on Monday and searched his wife's computers, cameras and other
 
belongings. He was not home at the time.

'She's still my wife, I still love her and still will no matter how this thing turns out,' he said.

His father, Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman, coached track at the University of Oregon from 1949 to 1972, winning four national titles.
