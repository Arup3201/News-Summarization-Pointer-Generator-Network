With a swing of his right boot unleashing a sumptuous curling strike into the top corner of Danijel Subasic's net, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had breathed hope into Arsenal's Champions League ambitions as the game entered added time.

After an atrocious performance against a Monaco side that only scored four times in the group stages, a 2-1 defeat, rather than 2-0, gave a different dimension to the cup tie for Arsene Wenger's side.

Those Arsenal fans left inside The Emirates could sense it. 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hauled Arsenal back into the Champions League tie with Monaco with a late goal

But only three minutes and seven seconds later, that hope had turned into a dying breath for Arsenal and it was Oxlade-Chamberlain who helped administer what could prove to be the knock-out blow.

He ran into trouble in midfield, lost possession to Bernardo Silva and once again, Monaco sprang into attack.

Arsenal had too many men forward as the tired legs of their defenders tried desperately to keep up with Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco, a 74th minute substitute, who gleefully raced clear and punished Oxlade-Chamberlain with a finish so cool and clinical, Dimitar Berbatov, the man he replaced, was undoubtedly tipping his hat.

The England international could see the damage his mistake had caused, covering his face with his shirt as Monaco celebrated extending their advantage to two goals.

On March 17, Arsenal will be in Monaco for the return leg, where there will only be room for the merciless finishing and defensive stubbornness that they were subjected to on their own patch on Wednesday.
