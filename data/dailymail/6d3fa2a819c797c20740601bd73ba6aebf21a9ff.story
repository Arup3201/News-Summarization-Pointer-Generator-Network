A 'bold initiative' which will see drivers banned from overtaking cyclists on designated 'cycle streets' could be introduced in cities throughout the UK in a bid to reduce the number of road deaths.

The proposed move would introduce a new 15mph speed limits on certain roads, where cyclists would also be given priority over motorists.

Under the government plans, police would be able to issue a £100 fine or three penalty points to any drivers who flout the new rules.

The introduction of 'cycle streets', proposed by the Department for Transport, would see bicycles have priority over motorists on dozens of roads across the UK

The scheme, which is being mooted in an attempt to reduce deaths among cyclists, is likely to be introduced in London, as well as the Government's 'cycle cities' - Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne and Oxford.

It is the latest move in a string of measures attempting to reduce some of the 19,000 injuries which are caused to cyclists on the UK roads each year. 

The scheme, which has been championed by
 the roads minister Robert Goodwill, has been laid out in a consultation document issued by
 the Department for Transport.

In the document it says: 'This is a bold initiative, which is being considered by some of the cycle cities and London, possibly including a ban on overtaking on lightly-trafficked roads where cycle flows are high.

'Subject to any scheme trial, this prohibition could be accompanied by an advisory speed limit of 15 mph is being considered by some of the cycle cities and London, possibly including a ban on overtaking on 
lightly-trafficked roads where cycle flows are high'.

'Cycle streets' are already widely used in the Netherlands and 
Germany to give priority to cyclists over motorists on minor streets. 

But in the Netherlands, cycle 
streets are only used where cyclists outnumber motorists by two to one, a situation rarely seen in Britain.

Other measures included in the consultation include creating pedestrian and cycle zones where they are currently known as ‘no motor vehicles’ zones.

It would mean cyclists are allowed in areas where cars are banned.

The consultation also proposes introducing a new priority crossings for cyclists. 

The scheme is likely to be introduced in London and the UK's so-called 'cycle cities', which include Manchester, Birmingham, Oxford and Newcastle upon Tyne

Under the plan, cycle routes would be placed 
next to zebra crossings markings, forcing drivers to give way to 
cyclists when crossing between cycle lanes.

The consultation on the document ends next month, meaning the scheme could be implemented before the general election.

Over the past few years, several other measures have been developed in a bid to increase road safety for cyclists.

Last year, a new electronic laser device that creates a bike lanes for a cyclist was unveiled by Hammacher Schlemmer, a company based in the US.

Last year, the Cyclist's Virtual Safety Lane - an electronic laser device which creats a bike lane in the dark - was unveiled by Hammacher Schlemmer, a compnay based in the US

The Cyclist's Virtual Safety Lane, which is the same size as a deck of cards, mounts to the rider's saddle post and uses a laser to project two lines either side of the bicycle.

The tiny device is visible under headlights or streetlights and gives motorists an indicator of where the cyclist is.

The red 
lane begins at the bike's seat and extends past the rear wheel - giving 
drivers a clear sight of the space they need to allocate to the cyclist. 

Earlier this year, new bike lights designed by behavioural scientist and keen cyclist Crawford Hollingworth that display the international symbol of the cyclist were hailed as a major breakthrough in road safety.

Research carried out by the University of Oxford suggests the bike symbol distinguishes cyclists from the blizzard of lights that streak the roads up and down the country.

The Greater London Authority is also building super cycle highways around the capital, to reduce congestion and increase safety on the roads. Four of the 12 planned super highways have already been built.

Over the last decade, cycling has grown in London alone by 70 per cent. On major roads, the number of cyclists has increased by 173 per cent.

This still only translates to two per cent of all journeys and falls short of many other UK and European cities.

But road safety is still a key factor. Between 2006 and 2011, the number of cycling casualties rose by half. Cycling accounts for 20 per cent of deaths and serious casualties on the roads.
