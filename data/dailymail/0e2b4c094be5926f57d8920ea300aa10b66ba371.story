Forget humans! This dog shows that he's the one taking the lead.  

Jason Ephraim, 30, from Houston, Texas, filmed the moment his smart canine grabbed his leash between his teeth ready to go walking.

The Labrador, named Baxter, is seen in the boot of a car raring to go for a stroll.

'Good boy, you have your leash ready to go to the park?' Ephraim says surprised.

However, he can't get going as Baxter's pal, Pluto, has his lead trapped over boot clasp.

In a bid to start driving to their destination Baxter helpfully grabs the cord in his mouth and moves it out of the way.

Ephraim said his 'jaw dropped' as he watched his clever pet in action. 

To date the video of Baxter has been watched more than 180,000 times.

Many viewers have applauded the dog for his behavior.
