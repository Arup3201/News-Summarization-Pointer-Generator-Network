George Lopez has built a career from making people laugh.

But on Thursday there was not much to chuckle about as the stand-up comedian was arrested for public intoxication after passing out on the floor of Caesars Windsor in Ontario, Canada, according to TMZ.

The 52-year-old sitcom star, who was given his big TV break by Sandra Bullock, was reportedly put in a 'drunk tank' to sober up though no charges were filed.

On Friday the La native offered a funny statement: 'Tied one on last night. Not feeling great this morning. I was trying to sleep it off, unfortunately, it was on the casino floor.'

That's George Lopez: The comedian was spotted passed out on the floor of a casino in Canada on Thursday and subsequently arrested for public intoxication

Hard working: The 52-year-old, seen here in September, was at the venue to perform his stand-up act

The Freddie star was seen on his left side with his stomach exposed as his black sweater had pulled up. He was wearing jeans and black shoes.

The grey-haired artist almost looked as if he had fallen asleep on the plush gold and purple carpet of the establishment. His legs were slightly parted and his right hand was laid out on the floor near his head.

Onlooker Chad Maura had taken a photo of Lopez and posted it to his Twitter account as security looked down on the comatose star. Soon after they had alerted police.

Police told People.com: 'We can confirm that at 11:25 p.m. Windsor police officers received custody of a male from the OPP Casino Enforcement Unit, The male was subsequently released with no charges.'

George - who made a fortune from starring in a self-titled sitcom from 2002 to 2007 (which Bullock executive produced) - had performed earlier in the evening before the incident occurred.

He is also scheduled to give another performance on Friday evening.

George - who hosted a late night show from 2009 to 2011 - has had health problems for over a decade brought on by a genetic condition that has caused his kidneys to deteriorate.

His wife Ann donated one of her kidneys to Lopez in 2005 and the transplant worked.

In 2010 the couple split and the following year they finalized their divorce. Together they have a daughter, Mayan.
