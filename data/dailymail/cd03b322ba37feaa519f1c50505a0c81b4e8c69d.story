While opposition leader Bill Shorten continues to criticise the Abbott government's policies, he was unable to reveal how his party plans on dealing with Australia's economic challenges.

Mr Shorten declined to go into specifics, in an interview on Wednesday night with Leigh Sales on ABC's 7.30 program, saying he couldn't provide 'a three-word slogan' just yet.

Despite this, he reiterated his one solution for the nation as: 'go for growth' but failed to further elaborate.

Although he admits there is an 'appetite' among Australians to hear some of Labor's policies, he was adamant they were not going to be unveiled until 2015.

He further agreed with Sales when she said the 'jury's still out' on him and his policies, saying 'if there was an election next Saturday, then you might be right'.

Mr Shorten was quick to address the current government's wrongdoings, saying its budget has problems.

But when Sales questioned how the opposition leader planned on addressing some of these issue, he did not express any specifics.

'I just can't give you a three-word slogan,' he told Sales.

'In good time before the next election, we'll detail all of our policies. I know you're not going to be particularly surprised if I don't reveal our full election manifesto tonight.'

When Sales put it to Mr Shorten this may cause uncertainty among Australians on their alternative prime minister, he responded:

'Well our challenge - if there was an election next Saturday, then you might be right, but there isn't. I would like there to be an election sooner than three years. I don't think this country can afford three years of Tony Abbott.'

 

He continued to say his party is working hard on its policies which will be announced throughout 2015.
