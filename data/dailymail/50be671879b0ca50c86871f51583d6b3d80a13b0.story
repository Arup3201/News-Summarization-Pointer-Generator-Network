It's no secret that golfing superstar Rory McIlroy has a weakness for women. 

But he has now admitted that his success with the fairer sex is perhaps not down to his natural good looks.

Asked what he would be if he hadn't taken up golf, the four-time major winner, 25, quipped: 'A virgin'.

Champion: But Rory McIlroy jokes he would be a virgin if it wasn't for his golfing success

Since ditching long-time girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki, 24, as she was planning their wedding in May, McIlroy has been building a reputation as something of a ladies man.

The multi-millionaire has revealed that what happened was 'for the best in terms of my golf.'

But he was recently romantically linked with receptionist Sasha Gale, who is from Lisburn, County Antrim, a city just the other side of Belfast from where he grew up.

Prior to that, he was spotted out with model Nadia Forde, fuelling speculation they were an item. 

Pictures taken from outside the hotel showed him cuddling up to one brunette wearing a white bodycon dress.And more recently, McIlroy was last month seen out in Manchester as he and a friend joined a group of pretty women at the Lowry hotel at 3am after a Saturday night out.

Not a virgin either: McIlroy's quip about his virginity was borrowed from lanky footballer Peter Crouch, pictured here shortly after marrying lingerie model Abbey Clancy in 2011

McIlroy's latest comment about his relationships with women came as he spoke alongside fellow Northern Irish Major champions Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell for a documentary to be shown on BBC2 tomorrow. 

In a sneak peak seen by The Sun, he also told how his growing fame forces him to put a 'shield up' when he is out in public. 

McIlroy's 'virgin' joke was, of course, not original. He was in fact echoing the very same comment given by lanky footballer Peter Crouch when he was asked what he'd be if it wasn't for his on-pitch success.

But while Crouchy seems happily settled down with lingerie model wife Abbey Clancy, McIlroy's romantic antics look set to continue for a while at least.
