Ukrainian media have published images they claim shows wreckage from the downed Malaysian aircraft is being used as part of a roadblock leading into the breakaway Donetsk region.

The photographs, taken by Ukrainian journalists, purport to show part of the aircraft's fuselage being used to strengthen a roadblock near the village of Rassypnoye.

Journalist Boris Mihalov, 32, said: 'We wanted to take more pictures and question those about how the wreckage was being used in this way but we were basically ambushed and carted away.

'They wanted to take the camera's memory card but we gave them an empty one and hid the one with the photograph where they didn't see it.'

The pictures have now been handed over to Ukrainian authorities.

MH17 was show down while flying through eastern Ukraine airspace on July 17, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board.

Pro-Russian rebels have been blamed for shooting down the Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur flight and have also been accused of hampering investigators' access to the crash scene, which lies in rebel-controlled territory.

Ukrainian media said they showed how little respect the rebels - who have sealed off part of Ukraine - have for the memory of the dead.

It was not possible to independently verify the pictures in a country which has seen both sides using the media to justify their case.

As fighting and violence increase in the region, claims and counter-claims about the brutality of the other side have become a constant presence in the local media and on social networks.

The Ukrainian military only recently appeared to be readying a long-awaited major assault on the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, warning civilians to leave as troops tightened their ring around the city amid heavy fighting.

Ukrainian troops have already taken the town of Yasynuvata, home to a key railway control centre between Donetsk and Luhansk.
