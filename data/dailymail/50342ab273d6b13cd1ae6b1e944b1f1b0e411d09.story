Rapper Eminem made an unlikely and puzzling appearance on ESPN's 'Saturday Night Football' halftime show last night, in which he awkwardly ansered questions about his new album and expressed his admiration of announcer Brent Musburger.

'You’re a legend,' Eminem said to Musburger.

'You my friend, are the legend,' Musburger replied.

Then it got awkward.

Awkward: Eminem made an uncomfortable appearance on ESPN's Saturday Night Football

Live: Eminem told host Brent Musburger that live TV makes him uncomfortable but it was obvious from the start that something was amiss

'I’m really uncomfortable right now,' Eminem said.

The rap superstar, who has a new album out in the fall, appeared to promote his new single and video, 'Berzerk.'

But 'Slim Shady' doesn't seem all that excited about the followup to his 2000 album, which is often lauded as one of the greatest rap albums of all-time.

When asked by Musburger what excited him about the new album, Eminem said, 'Um, nothing. No, when it’ll be out Nov. 5, I’ll probably be 
most excited to be done with it. It’s called Marshall Mathers II. It’s
kind of a revisit to the first 'Marshall Mathers’ album.'

Sitting with Musburger and co-announcer Kirk Herbstreit, Eminem seemed at first slightly confused, with his mouth hanging open.

Softie? Eminem is known more for his tough guy persona than his soft spot for sports announcers but the ESPN appearance proves Marshall Mathers has an Achilles Heel

What are you looking at? The rapper appeared fearful as he looked back and forth between sports announcers and later admitted he was terribly uncomfortable

He's a fan! In one of the lighter moments of his appearance, Eminem told Brent Musburger that he thinks he's a legend

Eminem rarely does interviews, and 
certainly not live on ESPN. Musburger asked him questions about his 
music and referred to him by his given name, Marshall Mathers.

Said Eminem: 'Live TV freaks me out a little bit.'

But he soon seemed to relax, saying Berzerk would be the new theme of SNF.

The Detroit native also talked about his devotion to the Detroit Lions.
