When Ian Bell was dropped after two matches of England’s tour to Sri Lanka before Christmas, his World Cup place was very much in jeopardy.

Now he has confirmed his role at the top of the order in emphatic fashion. Not only did Bell’s magnificent 187 at the Manuka Oval on Wednesday spoil Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s annual cricketing party but it proved that perhaps England can play modern one-day cricket after all.

The giddy heights of 391 for six against a far-from-shabby Prime Minister’s XI was certainly a statement from an England side who seemed to arrive in Australia hoping once again that everything would be all right on the World Cup night.

Bell's innings dispelled any thoughts that he does not deserve a place in England's World Cup line-up

Nothing more so than the contribution of Bell, who was controversially handed Alastair Cook’s opening role here ahead of Alex Hales on the far-from- convincing evidence of just three centuries in 150 ODIs.

Bell is England’s classiest Test batsman but he has never been as comfortable in coloured clothing and his selection seemed to provide more ammunition to those who feel England remain stuck in the one-day dark ages.

This, then, was vindication for the selectors, who ditched their captain Cook before coming here but not their game-plan, and provided a little hope that this World Cup mission might not necessarily be doomed to failure.

‘Of course I was worried about my World Cup place,’ admitted Bell afterwards. ‘The squad had to be narrowed down and a lot of people have come in and done well. Coming out here I didn’t know where I was going to bat or even if I was going to start, so it was nice to have a good chat with Eoin Morgan when he told me I was going to get first crack.’

The sight of Glenn Maxwell, far from certain of a place in Australia’s World Cup side, smashing 136 off 89 balls in reply ensured England did not get too carried away by their sudden show of batting strength.

Another notable mention must go to Chris Woakes who managed to complete a stunning 'keepy-up' catch to dismiss Lega Siaka.

The 25-year-old fumbled Siaka's attempt for a boundary as the ball rebounded off his thigh and looked destined to be a missed chance in the field. However Woakes was able to flick the ball with his feet back towards his hands in one swift motion to complete an impressive recovery to add an extra gloss to the victory.

More will become clear once England have faced Australia and India in the Tri-series, which begins tomorrow, but for now they can be satisfied with just about the perfect batting display even if their bowling here was not so effective.

England want Bell to bat through an innings while others, notably his partner Moeen Ali, attack around him and the plan was executed spectacularly by the openers and a worthy accomplice in James Taylor.

Moeen said ahead of this final warm-up game that he would carry on being aggressive and he was as good as his word as he smacked 71 off 49 balls, including six fours in one frenetic nine-ball spell.

Bell, meanwhile, moved to his hundred at just about a run a ball before accelerating to England’s highest individual score in a one-day match, hitting three sixes and 20 fours while consigning Hales very much to the subs’ bench.

‘One thing I’ve probably been guilty of when I’ve opened in the past is getting to 60 or 70 and not going on,’ said Bell. ‘But I enjoyed myself and if I can do that a couple more times it will be good for the team. It’s nice to have a good start but the big stuff starts on Friday.’

Only when he had reached 68 did Bell offer a semblance of a chance — Maxwell doing well to get a hand to a low drive — before guiding England to their equal highest score in a 50-over game, matching the 391 they smashed against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge in the heady summer of 2005.

Taylor is another batsman who looked a long way from a World Cup place not so long ago but he came into the England side in Sri Lanka when Cook was suspended and has made the most of his unexpected opportunity. 

The biggest compliment that can be paid to Bell and Taylor is that they moved through the gears without fuss and as effortlessly as any of the leading exponents of the modern Twenty20-driven 50-over game. They added 141 in 24 overs, Taylor hitting 71 off 77 balls, as England impressively followed up the 364 they had scored in their opening tour match here in the Australian capital against rather more modest opposition.

When England stood at 200 for one after 30 overs, a score of 400 did look on the cards and their failure to fully do themselves justice looked as if it might cost them dear when Maxwell set off in hot pursuit. The man known as the ‘Big Show’ in these parts is certainly a destructive performer and here he came close to taking apart a one-dimensional England attack lacking Jimmy Anderson, who is being eased back into competitive action.

If Maxwell, one of two Australian World Cup players along with Pat Cummins in the PM’s side, had stayed for another five overs, England would have been in trouble. But once Stuart Broad had him caught at point, the home side had too big a mountain to climb.

They finished 60 short on a day of 722 runs, Jos Buttler having earlier taking a spectacular running catch to dismiss captain Chris Rogers, and now England will travel to Sydney to take on Australia with just a little hope in their heart.
