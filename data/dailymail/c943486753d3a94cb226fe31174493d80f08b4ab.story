A man jailed for killing Baby P has been released from prison three months early and been given a new identity funded by the taxpayer despite still being considered a danger to the public. 

Jason Owen received a six year jail sentence for allowing the toddler to die at his home in Tottenham, north London on August 3, 2007. 

Owen received a six-year jail term and had been earlier released on licence in 2011 but was recalled to prison after breaching the terms of the agreement.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'The independent Parole Board will direct the re-release of recalled offenders only once the Board are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community.

'Serious offenders on licence are subject to a strict set of conditions which can include restrictions on their movements, as well as frequent meetings with their offender manager.

'When released from prison, offenders managed through Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) will be risk assessed, monitored and supervised by Probation, Police and other agencies.'

It is understood that Owen is living in a bail hostel in the south of England under an assumed name. However, he will be moving into a taxpayer funded bedsit in the coming weeks. 

The 42-year-old criminal was under constant threat from fellow inmates in prison because of the nature of his conviction.  

Peter Connelly, (Baby P), suffered 50 separate injuries before his death in August 2007

Owen was addicted to crack cocaine and had previous convictions for arson.

At the time of Peter Connelly's death, Owen was living at the house with his brother Stephen Barker and the baby's mother Tracey Connelly. 

Criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher told the Sunday Mirror: 'The reason he was let out early was not because he is no longer a danger or for leniency but so he can be supervised. 

'Probation officers will monitor him closely for the coming weeks to try to minimise the risk of reoffending. 

The 17-month-old toddler received more than 50 separate injuries including a broken back. His body was recovered from a blood spattered cot. 

His mother Tracey Connelly was released from prison in November 2013. She tried to secure an anonymity order similar to the one secured by Maxine Carr, Robert Thompson, Jon Venables and Mary Bell. 

Stephen Barker was sentenced to 12 years in prison for killing Baby P. 

He later received a 10 year jail term for raping a two-year-old girl
