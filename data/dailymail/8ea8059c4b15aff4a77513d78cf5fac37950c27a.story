A woman jumped to her death from a bridge because she was plagued by a skin condition that caused her face to redden.

An inquest heard how Vicky Norfolk, 31, had suffered from rosacea, which  can look like a rash, for several months and was struggling to cope with her change in appearance.

Despite support from her family, the shop assistant descended into depression and resolved to take her own life.

Tragically she was successful on her third attempt, leaping from the Humber Bridge in Hull in February last year.

Miss Norfolk’s family said her mental health had deteriorated in a matter of weeks. They want to highlight the lack of immediate counselling for people suffering depression.

Miss Norfolk’s mother Anne, 58, said: ‘We don’t feel there were enough resources in place to help her combat that depression. It occurred literally over a matter of weeks and with very little acknowledgement from our GP.’

The inquest in Hull heard how a month before her suicide Miss Norfolk cycled to the bridge and climbed over the railings.

Off-duty police officer Mark Osborn spotted her as he was cycling across and persuaded her not to jump.

‘She said she was very sad and depressed and decided to come to the bridge to commit suicide,’ PC Osborn told the inquest.

The following month, Miss Norfolk returned to the bridge but decided against jumping.

More than six million Britons have rosacea. Famous sufferers including former US President Bill Clinton and Ricky Wilson from rock band Kaiser Chiefs.

Rosacea causes facial redness and spots on the forehead and cheeks and around the mouth and nose, which can look red and swollen.

Surveys show seven in ten sufferers feel rosacea has sapped their confidence and affected their working life, while two in five have avoided being seen in public and cancelled social plans. One in three admit to calling in sick at work because of the condition.

Treatments include antibiotics as well as laser therapy. Although the condition is incurable, treatments work best if the condition is caught early.

Dermatologist David Fenton said the biggest danger was the damage to self-confidence.

‘Professional help should also  be sought if someone is over- focusing on the problem,’ he said. ‘Even the most loving family is not equipped to deal with this.’

Days later PC Osborn cycled back over the bridge and saw Miss Norfolk’s bike in almost the same place as before. But this time she was not there. The next day, her mother went round to her house accompanied by police officers and found a note in the kitchen.

Miss Norfolk’s body was found 12 months later after a dog walker spotted her remains.

Speaking at the inquest, Mrs Norfolk said her daughter had been a happy and warm person but had become obsessed with her skin condition in the months that it developed.

She added: ‘She struggled to look past it, even though it was only visible if you looked closely.

‘As a family, we tried everything to help and it is heartbreaking that we couldn’t reach out to her.’

Mrs Norfolk told how she had gone with her daughter to see doctors on two occasions in the months leading up to her death.

She said: ‘Vicky was good at covering up the fact she was suffering from depression but, over time, she couldn’t see anything else in the mirror any more.’

Delivering a verdict of suicide, Coroner David Rosenberg said: ‘While she might have been stable, it was clear Vicky was suffering from depression.

‘My verdict is that she took her own life while the balance of her mind was disturbed.’

Mrs Norfolk added: ‘Mental health is such a secret killer and we hope that if any good can come from her death, it will be to emphasise the need for greater understanding, acceptance, time and investment when dealing with these problems.’
