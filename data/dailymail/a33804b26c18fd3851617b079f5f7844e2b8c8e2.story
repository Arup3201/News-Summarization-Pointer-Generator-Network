Princess Eugenie was seen out and about in  New York yesterday with her new boss, the rather dashing Alexander Gilkes, before moving on to a dinner with her father Prince Andrew.

Princess Eugenie of York was spotted enjoying a stroll on the way to lunch in New York’s trendy Soho with Eton-educated Alexander Gilkes, 34, co-founder of Paddle8, an online auction house which specialises in upmarket art and collectibles, which Eugenie started work for this month.

The 23-year-old royal is clearly embracing life in New York and her feet have barely touched the ground since she arrived, having been seen out shopping with her mother Sarah Ferguson and dining out with mystery men as well as lunching with her new boss and having dinner with her father.

The Princess was seen walking to lunch in NYC's Soho with Alexander Gilkes, co-founder of Paddle8, and Thomas Galbraith, the managing director of Paddle8

Eugenie wore a moss-coloured dress which showed off her legs, and carried a black leather jacket

Despite her hectic schedule, Eugenie looked relaxed as she strolled through 
the sunshine wearing a moss-coloured belted shift dress that emphasised 
her waist and showed off plenty of leg.

She paired the simple dress with black Rag & Bone ankle books and carried a black leather jacket in her arms.

With her auburn hair loose around her shoulders the princess seemed carefree as she shared a joke with Alexander, a friend of Prince William and Harry from their Eton days.

Despite Alexander’s good looks there is no romance brewing between the pair, as Eugenie is currently dating Jack Brooksbank, 27 and Gilkes is married to Misha Nonoo, 26, who runs a fashion business in Manhattan.

The pair were joined by Thomas Galbraith, the managing director of Paddle8.

Alexander’s links to the Royals go back to his school days at Eton.

His brother Charlie, who founded London nightspots Maggies and Kitts, is a firm friend of Prince William and dated the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister Pippa, after they were both students at Edinburgh University.

Eugenie and her older sister Beatrice attended Alexander and Misha's wedding in Venice last year.

Also in attendance were James Middleton, Kate and Pippa’s younger brother, while guests including bride’s cousin Houda Nonoo, the Bahraini ambassador to the U.S, multi-millionaire banking scion Matthew Mellon and Helen Rockefeller were treated to a performance by singer Lana Del Ray.

In fact, Alexander remains so close to the Royals that he was spotted out with Pippa Middleton, 30, during her visit to Manhattan last summer.

The couple were seen leaving Soho House, while Pippa was clad in a bright red dress designed by his wife Mishal Nonoo.

Eugenie hit headlines recently  when photos emerged of her ‘twerking’ against a giant stuffed bear, but the publicity doesn’t seem to have thrown the young royal, who enjoyed a dinner with her father Prince Andrew in the evening.

The father and daughter headed to ABC Kitchen in New York. The princess wore a short, plum-coloured silk dress with a pair of high-heeled black ankle boots for her date with her father.

After their dinner, the pair were driven off with their security detail in a blacked-out car.

Eugenie clearly enjoys dining out; she was recently spotted enjoying lunch with Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas at popular Kensington restaurant Bumpkin.

Paddle8 is an online auction house, offering artworks by international artists which aims to make the process of auctions easier- removing much of the intermediate bureaucracy.

The idea is that by buying and selling online is not only  more ‘user-friendly and easy, but the transaction is much more direct between buyer and seller, minimising costs.

On their website Paddle8 claim that commission Paddle8 takes is lower than many traditional auction houses: ‘Our commission structure is significantly discounted from market norms: a flat 6% for vendors and 12% for buyers. Other costs, including shipping, insurance, and storage are minimized or eliminated by shipping goods directly from sellers without any intermediaries. This minimizes costs for sellers, while creating transparency and ease of purchase for buyers.’

They run two types of auction; Themed auctions which sell items based on ‘eclectic groups’ which run monthly, and Benefit auctions where they team up with non-profit organisations and charities.

Paddle8 currently have offices in New York and LA, and claim on their website they will be opening in London ‘soon’.

Alexander Gilkes co-founded Paddle8 with Aditya Julka , a Harvard Business School Baker Scholar and COO and former investment banker Osman Khan.
