Texting while driving can be incredibly dangerous and in most countries it is completely outlawed.

That doesn’t stop some thoughtless motorists from trying to compose a message while flying along a motorway, though, increasing the chance of a fatal accident.

But now one company claims to have developed a ‘texting gun’ that can recognise the frequency of a text message, allowing police to fine people for doing it.

A company in Virginia has designed a device to detect drivers who text. The Sniffer Sleuth II (shown), made by ComSonics, can apparently discern if a phone is being used to make a call, data transfer or text. This is useful for countries where the law on phone usage is complicated

In the UK it is illegal to use your phone at all when driving, while the law varies in the US from state to state - most allow phone calls but no texting.

Drivers caught using a phone in the UK can be charged up to £1,000 ($1,640) and also lose their license - although hands-free kits and sat navs are allowed.

These inconsistencies can make it difficult for police to work out if a person is being distracted by their phone or not.

This led to Virginia-based ComSonics to design a gun that can detect frequencies. 

Using an Apple Watch while driving could put you in prison for up to two years, motoring experts have warned.

When the gadget is released next year, it will allow users to make and receive calls, check their messages and monitor their health by operating the device on their wrists.

But people who use Apple Watch while on the road are at risk of causing fatal crashes and will face the same penalties as those caught on their mobile phones.

This is according to the London-based Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) who has warned that smartwatches will 'significantly' impair driving performance.

Existing research by the IAM on smartphone use between 2006 and 2010 found distraction from a mobile phone was a contributory factor in 1,960 road accidents, 110 of which were fatal. 

The device, called the Sniffer Sleuth II, is currently in production although no release date or price has been announced yet.

According to the Virginian-Pilot, it can discern the different frequencies from a text message, phone call and data transfer.

It apparently uses similar technology used by cable repairmen to find where a cable is damaged, who look for transmission ‘leaks’.

For states like Virginia where talking on the phone while driving is legal but texting is not, this could be especially useful.

In addition, the device can apparently even work out which person in the car is texting, so it will not alert police to issue a fine if it spots frequencies from a passenger.

The device has yet to be given legislative approval amid some privacy concerns, but Malcolm MacIntyre of ComSonics told the Virginian-Pilot it was ‘close to production.’

When reached for further comment on these privacy concerns and also how accurate the device is in discerning signals, ComSonics was yet to respond.

In the US, for example, some states allow calls but not texts while driving. This means police could identify texters and find them on the spot. The company is currently seeking legislative approval for the 'texting gun' amid some privacy concerns
