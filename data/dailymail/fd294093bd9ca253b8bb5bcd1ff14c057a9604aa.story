When the plane has passed the woman simply lets out an exasperated 'Oh my god!'

Only moments before, a light aircraft purportedly travelling at 200mph, came within inches of crashing into her as she filmed a friend cavorting on a quad bike.

The pair initially appear carefree, as the male performs a wheelie on the vehicle, but within seconds they are lucky to escape alive.

Harmless: A man is initially filmed by a woman riding the small quad bike on a  runway

Approaching: The light aircraft can be seen coming in fast from the other end of the runway

Speeding: The plane, purportedly traveling at 200mph, draws alongside the bike-rider

Flying: The man hardly has time to react as the speeding vehicle whizzes past him

As the man rides down the runway, fumes can be seen in the distance as the aircraft approaches in their direction.

When it becomes clear that the vehicle is speeding in their direction, the female, who is all the while operating a video camera, can be heard screaming hysterically.

The plane, which appears to be travelling just above the runway, narrowly misses the bike-rider, leaving a trail of fumes in his face.

But as the propeller-driven plane twists in midair it comes even closer to colliding with the female.

Hold tight: After first missing the bike-rider the plane is on course to collide with the video camera operator

Inches: The footage reveals how close the plane comes to colliding with the unnamed woman

After it has passed, the woman can be heard saying 'Oh my god...holy s***.'

She then turns her camera to show the plane travelling through the sky, having continued on an upward trajectory after nearly hitting her.

The incident is reminiscent of a famous scene from the 1959 film North by Northwest, starring Cary Grant, in which his character is chased by a biplane along a runway

It is not yet known where or when the footage, which was posted on Youtube, was taken, although the woman speaks with an American accent.

Trail: The plane, which did not appear to have landed properly on the runway, left a trail of fumes

Haze: The bike rider's outline can be seen through the fumes on the runway

Flying off: After continuing on an upward trajectory after passing the woman the plane flew off into the sky

Big screen: The incident was reminiscent of a famous scene from the 1959 film North by Northwest, starring Cary Grant, in which his character is chased by a biplane along a runway
