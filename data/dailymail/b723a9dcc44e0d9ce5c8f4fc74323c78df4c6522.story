The Oscar-winning artist who designed 
the creature in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic Alien has died at 
age 74 from injuries suffered in a fall, his museum said today.

Hans Giger died in a hospital yesterday, Sandra Mivelaz, administrator of the H.R. Giger museum in Gruyeres, western Switzerland, said.

Giger's
 works, often showing macabre scenes of humans and machines fused into 
hellish hybrids, influenced a generation of movie directors and inspired
 an enduring fashion for 'biomechanical' tattoos.

'My
 paintings seem to make the strongest impression on people who are, 
well, who are crazy,' Giger said in a 1979 interview with Starlog 
magazine. 'If they like my work they are creative ... or they are 
crazy.'

Born Hans Ruedi 
Giger on February 5, 1940, in the south-eastern Swiss town of Chur, he 
trained as an industrial designer because his father insisted that he 
learn a proper trade.

His 
mother Melli, to whom he showed a lifelong devotion, encouraged her 
son's passion for art, despite his unconventional obsession with death 
and sex that found little appreciation in 1960s rural Switzerland.

The
 host of one of his early exhibitions was reportedly forced to wipe the 
spit of disgusted neighbors off the gallery windows every morning.

A
 collection of his early work, 'Ein Fressen fuer den Psychiater' - 'A 
Feast for the Psychiatrist' - used mainly ink and oil, but Giger soon 
discovered the airbrush and pioneered his own freehand technique. He 
also created sculptures, preferably using metal, styorofoam and plastic.

Giger's vision of a human 
skull encased in a machine appeared on the cover of 'Brain Salad 
Surgery,' a 1973 album by the rock band Emerson, Lake and Palmer.

Along
 with his design for Debbie Harry's solo album, 'Koo Koo' (1981), it 
featured in a 1991 Rolling Stone magazine list of the top 100 album 
covers of all time.

Giger 
went on to work as a set designer for Hollywood, contributing to 
'Species,' 'Poltergeist II,' 'Dune,' and most famously 'Alien,' for 
which he received a 1979 Academy Award for special effects.

Frequently
 frustrated by the Hollywood production process, Giger eventually 
disowned much of the work that was attributed to him on screen.

The alien was used in a series of spin-off films, including this, from Alien Vs Predator

Giger also designed the sets from the 1984 David Lynch film Dune, starring Kyle MacLachlan

The
 image of a brooding, mysterious artist was nurtured by Giger working 
only at night, keeping his curtains permanently drawn and dressing 
mainly in black - a habit he acquired while working as a draftsman 
because it made Indian ink stains stand out less on his clothes.

While
 his work was commercially successful, critics derided it as morbid 
kitsch. His designs were exhibited more frequently in 'Alien' theme 
bars, short-lived Giger museums and at tattoo conventions than in 
established art galleries.

In 1998, Giger acquired the Chateau St. Germain in Gruyeres and established the H.R. Giger Museum.

Giger was pleased that his idea of machines with human skin became a popular motif in body art.

'The
 greatest compliment is when people get tattooed with my work, whether 
it's done well or not,' he told Seconds magazine in 1994. 'To wear 
something like that your whole life is the largest compliment someone 
can pay to you as an artist.'

Details on survivors and funeral plans were not immediately available.
