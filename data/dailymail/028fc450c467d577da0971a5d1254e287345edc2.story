Fraser, pictured at the funeral of his former gangland boss Charlie Richardson in 2012, is currently in an induced coma in Kings Hospital in south London

Family and friends of notorious gangster 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, who is in a coma and being kept alive by a life support machine, have gathered to say their goodbyes.

The 90-year-old criminal, who has spent almost half his life in prison, is in a critical condition at Kings Hospital in south London after reportedly undergoing surgery on Friday.

He was induced into a coma in the intensive care unit following complications during an operation and a bedside vigil was held last night.

A family source told The Mirror: 'Doctors fear that because of his age his body is struggling to cope with the operation. It does not look good at all.

'He is a tough old sod and we know he will fight as hard as he ever has. We all hope he comes through this.'

It is believed he had gone into hospital for a hip operation but doctors spotted he had a fractured left leg two weeks later, according to media reports.  

The injury is thought to be a recurring one suffered during the 1969 Parkhurst Prison riots on the Isle of Wight, when he spent six weeks in the prison hospital.

Another friend, speaking to The Sun, said: 'Frankie's one tough b****** - but this looks like it might be the end. Everyone fears the worst.'

His ex-partner Marilyn Wiseby, who is the daughter of Great Train Robber Tommy Wiseby, told the paper: 'It's a terrible shock. Frank is the most honest man I have known.'

A source also confirmed that his son Francis, 58, had gone to the hospital last night to be with his father. 

Fraser is one of the last surviving ‘celebrity criminals’ after he joined turf wars between London gangs in the sixties.

He was a member of the Richardson gang or the 'torture gang', led by brothers Charlie and Eddie Richardson, and  were widely feared in London’s underworld.

Prior to that he was a bodyguard to notorious gangland leader Billy Hill, where he took part in bank robberies and and carried out razor blade attacks - which earned him £50 a time. 

He has spent 42 years – almost half his life – in prison for 26 offences.  

The former gangland leader, who was infamous for pulling out rivals' teeth with a pair of pliers, was handed an Asbo last year after flying into a rage with a fellow pensioner at his care home.

Staff called police after things got heated between Fraser and the 87-year-old man, who has dementia, after he found him sitting in his favourite seat.

Fraser was jailed for 10 years in 1967 for his part in the Richardson gang, where he tortured people by pulling out their teeth with pliers if they were disloyal

He was admitted to sheltered accommodation in Bermondsey, south east London, just a few miles from haunts during his criminal career, when living along became 'too much for him', his family said. 

Speaking about the incident last year his son, David, explained: ‘They were always rowing and it ended up with the police being called.

'The other man had dementia and was not all there. All he did was bark back at him.

‘He said it was about rowing as they were all screaming and shouting at each other.

'My dad ended up with an Asbo, but he was not the only person to get one. He laughed about it.

Fraser dated Marilyn Wiseby, daughter of the Great Train Robber, Tommy Wiseby, for a number of years

'They said it was effectively a warning. It didn’t make much difference to him and he carried on as he normally did. It was a really funny turnout.'

His son added: ‘There are no problems now and the other people in the home are very protective of him. 

'He’s quite popular among them because he likes to treat them if he gets a few quid. They all know about his background, because they are all from the same area. 

He has spent 42 years in prison for 26 offences. His first offence was stealing a pack of cigarettes when he was 13. Here he is pictured greeting Reggie Kray at the funeral of his older brother Charles Junior in 2000

Even as a pensioner the gangster was unable to keep out of trouble and last year was given an Asbo after he got into an argument with an 87-year-old man for sitting in his favourite armchair at their care home

'Mad' Frankie Fraser, 90, is in a critical condition in hospital after complications during surgery

Born Francis Fraser, in Lambeth, south London, he committed his first crime at the age of 13, when he stole a packet of cigarettes and was sent to an approved school.

What officers didn't know then was that his crime spree would continue over a career spanning seven decades, and his offences only worsened.

It was during the Second World War that he was branded 'Mad' Frankie, after he feigned a mental illness to avoid being called up to the front line.

He then became involved in serious crime - and the  war provided a perfect backdrop with the blackout, rationing and a shortage of police officers.

At 17 he was sent to Borstal for breaking and entering a hosiery shop in Waterloo and was then given a 15-month prison sentence for shopbreaking.

After the war he was involved in a smash-and-grab raid on a jeweller's and was given a two year prison sentence.

In the 1950s he worked for underworld boss Billy Hill and carried out razor attacks on victims for £50 each.

He later joined the notorious Richardson gang, formed by brothers Eddie and Charlie, and began carrying out more criminal activities.

They set up a fruit machine enterprise, which they would sell to pub landlords, to cover up their crimes.

In 1966 he was charged with the murder of Richard Hart, who was shot at a club in Catford, but the charges were dropped when a witness changed their testimony.

The following year he was involved in a torture trial the Old Bailey, where members of the gang were charged with electrocuting, whipping and burning those disloyal to them.

Fraser himself was charged with pulling out people's teeth with pliers and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

During his time behind bars he was involved in violence and was a major instigator in the Parkhurst Prison riots in 1969. Each incident added more time to his sentence.

His last jail term ended in 1989, but in 2011 he was handed an Asbo after getting into an argument with a fellow pensioner at the sheltered accommodation he stays at in Bermondsey.
