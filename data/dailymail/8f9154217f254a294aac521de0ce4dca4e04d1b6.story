Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is known in Westminster for being a hard-nosed Tory, with a keen eye for cutting costs.

But his strait-laced, right-wing reputation suffered a blow today after he was revealed to have been a goth who read left-wing newspapers during his schooldays.

The claim was all the more bizarre coming from former classmate, TV and radio host Richard Madeley.

Mr Hammond is making headlines after defying David Cameron to say he would vote to leave Europe if there was a referendum now.

The former businessman is now known for being a hardline Conservative, particularly on spending taxpayers money having served as George Osborne’s deputy in opposition.

But it seems he was much less buttoned-up when a schoolboy growing up in Essex.

In fact he was regularly reprimanded about not having his top button done up, slouching in official school photos.

Mr Madeley revealed on Twitter that he was ‘at school with Phil Hammond - a Goth back then’.

He is understood to have made a similar claim during a radio show in 2011, although sources close to Mr Hammond suggested it was a 'wind-up'.

The pair were in the same class at Shenfield High School in Brentwood, Essex in the 1970s.

Mr Madeley added that the future Tory Cabinet minister who appears at the Despatch Box in well-tailored suits ‘used to arrive in class in leather trench-coat with The Guardian under his arm’.

Mr Madeley made the revelation as Mr Hammond suggested he would vote to leave the EU if there was a referendum now.

Mr Cameron today slapped him down, saying ministers should not answer ‘hypothetical questions’.

Mr Madeley said the Prime Minister had
suffered a long weekend after Mr Hammond, and Education Secretary 
Michael Gove had parked their ‘tanks on his lawn’.

Mr
Hammond was born in Epping in Essex in December 1995. The son of a 
civil engineer, he went to Shenfield school in Brentwood before studying
Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford.

He
later worked in the private sector, for medical equipment and building 
firms, before becoming Tory MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in 1997.

He looks back fondly on his youth. ‘I had some very fond memories of school,’ Mr Hammond told the Brentwood Gazette last year.

He revealed how he made the decision to go to Oxford in 1970, which set him on course to one day join the Cabinet.

He said: ‘Harold Wilson had been in office, but I didn't get anything he did.

‘I remember the day after the general election when Harold Wilson had lost, I remember quite clearly cycling from my house in Hutton along Long Ridings and feeling what a relief to live in a country with a Tory government again.’

He said he later bumbed into his headteacher. 'I hadn't really decided that until that moment. But I suppose everything else flowed from there. My life would have been totally different if it hadn't been for that.

'What I'm trying to say is that if you see an opportunity you have to grab it – it might not come round again.'

Over the weekend Mr Hammond gave Mr Cameron a headache with his assertion that he would vote to leave the EU.

Asked on the BBC’s Pienaar’s Politics radio programme whether he would vote to leave the EU as things stand, replied: ‘Yes, because I believe that we have to negotiate a better solution that works better for Britain if we are going to stay in and play a part in the European Union in the future.

'But let me be absolutely clear: I think it is defeatist to sort of say we want to leave the European Union.

'We’re going to try and change the rules and change the way it works and change the objectives that it has in order to make it something that works for Britain.'

However, he added: 'If the choice is between an EU exactly as it is today and not being a part of that then I have to say that I’m on the side of the argument that Michael Gove has put forward.'
