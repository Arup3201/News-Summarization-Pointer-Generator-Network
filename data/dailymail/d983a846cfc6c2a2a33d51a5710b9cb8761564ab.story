The richest man in China is expanding his commercial property empire into Australia with plans to invest $1.7 billion in local real estate developments.

Wang Jianlin's Hong Kong-based conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group has announced the launch of Wanda Australia including a major $971 million investment in The Jewel resort on the Gold Coast, and is on the hunt for property in Sydney.

In a statement the company said it would purchase a controlling 60 per cent stake in The Jewel at Surfer's Paradise where it would build the city's first five-star hotel and apartment complex on the beachfront.

Wang Jianlin became the richest man on mainland China last year, according to Forbes, with an estimated wealth of $US15.9 billion ($17.1 billion)

Roland Evans, director of Gold Coast-based Canford Property Group, has been working closely with Wanda and said the company is also looking for property in Sydney

'With a planned gross floor area of 146,000 square meters, the project will comprise three towers, one of which will be a five-star hotel, while the other two will house serviced apartments,' the statement read.

'The project's central park, conference rooms, restaurants, bars and other entertainment facilities will be located directly on the beachfront.'

The joint venture with Chinese company Ridong Group will begin construction in 2015 and open in 2018.

Mr Wang became the richest man on mainland China last year, according to Forbes, with an estimated wealth of $US15.9 billion ($17.1 billion).

He visited Australia in June to inspect properties and to meet with Trade Minister Andrew Robb, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman and Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate.

Wanda's expansion in Australia is part of the company's aim to be the world's largest hotel chain with plans to build at least 15 hotels in 15 cities by 2020.

Roland Evans, director of Gold Coast-based Canford Property Group, has been working closely with Wanda and said the company is also looking for property in Sydney.

'It's no secret that they're actively looking for an opportunity in Sydney, just about everybody in the property game knows of their desire,' Mr Evans told Daily Mail Australia.

When asked what other specific projects were in the pipeline, Mr Evans said: 'I can't comment on that, they're in negotiationsâ€¦ I'm bound to secrecy.'

Chinese tourism and expenditure in Australia is growing rapidly, with Tourism Research Australia figures showing that Chinese visitor expenditure grew by 15.1 percent (or $670 million) to reach $5.1 billion in the year ending March 2014.

Mr Evans said Wanda's Jewel investment would accelerate this further on the Gold Coast.

'This is the best thing to happen to the Gold Coast in many, many years,' he said.

'In China Wanda dominate the market in as much as when Wanda goes somewhere the rest follow.

'So a lot of analysts will be closely studying Wanda's move into the Gold Coast and our perceiving is it will act as a catalyst for a lot of investment.'

Mr Evans said Mr Wang's desire was to make Wanda the world's largest hotel operator 'within a very short space of time'.

'That will be a massive draw for Chinese tourists who aren't aware of the Gold Coast to come visit,' he said.

The company said the Jewel would be the city's first five-star hotel and apartment complex on the beachfront

The Jewel has a planned gross floor area of 146,000 square meters

'They know their biggest brand is there with their hotel so for them it really is a no brainer.'

Mayor Tate said the Gold Coast was in the midst of a 'renaissance' in the lead up to the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

'News that Jewel is one step closer to breaking ground is phenomenal and will mean much more to the Gold Coast than construction jobs,' he said,

'It is a world class project that will become a tourism draw card in its own right.
