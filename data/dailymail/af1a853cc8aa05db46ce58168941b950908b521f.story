A recovery operation is underway in Taiwan as plane seats and fuselage are removed from homes after yesterday's plane crash which killed 48 people.

Today the airline announced that stormy weather trailing behind a typhoon was the likely cause of the crash which also left ten people on the plane injured and five on the ground.

The ATR-72 operated by Taiwan's TransAsia Airways was carrying 58 passengers and crew when it crashed while trying to land in the Penghu island chain in the Taiwan Strait between Taiwan and China.

The plane was flying from the city of Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan.

The victims included 46 Taiwanese and two French medical students who were interns in Taiwan.

The crash came hours after Typhoon Matmo passed over Taiwan. 

About 200 airline flights at Taiwanese airports had been canceled earlier in the day due to rain and high winds. 

Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau had warned of heavy rains Wednesday evening even after Matmo moved west into China.

'According to what we can understand so far, this was due to weather, the influence of the typhoon,' a TransAsia representative, Phoebe Lu, told The Associated Press. She said the carrier was waiting for Taiwanese authorities to complete an investigation to get confirmation.

A spokesman for Taiwan's air regulator, the Civil Aeronautics Administration, noted the bad weather but said an investigation still was under way.

'Even though there was bad weather, whether to land or not was up to the pilots. It is confirmed that before landing, the pilots circled, but the cause is yet to be determined,' the spokesman, Lee Wan-lee, told reporters.

Local television showed relatives of victims, including one woman who lost three daughters.

One victim, firefighter Lee Ming-tsun, 47, was found in the wreckage by his own co-workers, the government's Central News Agency reported.

Co-pilot Chiang Kuan-hsing's mother, holding back tears on television, said: 'He had reached the goal he wanted' to in his career. 'When he went to another place, we'd always wish him well.'

The airline identified the French passengers as Jeromine Deramond and Penelope Luternauer. They were medical school interns at Taipei's National Taiwan University, the university said.

The crash of Flight GE222 was Taiwan's first fatal air accident in 12 years.

Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou called for one minute of silence in memory of the victims. 'I think that like a lot of citizens, last night I felt very sorrowful,' he said in comments broadcast on television.

The airline said one of the injured 10 survivors had gone home and five local residents who were hurt on the ground were treated and released. The crash damaged eight houses, according to Chen Tung-yi, a section chief with the Penghu disaster response center.

'All the bodies have been dug out,' Chen said.

Taiwan's last major aviation disaster was also near Penghu. In 2002, a China Airlines Boeing 747 broke apart in midair and crashed into the Taiwan Strait, killing all 225 people aboard

Family members were flying to Magong airport near the crash site to visit a morgue and identify victims, the airline said.

Penghu, a scenic chain of 64 islets, is a popular tourist site about 150 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the Taiwanese capital, Taipei.

The 14-year-old plane lost contact with the tower after saying it would make a second landing attempt, according to the head of Taiwan's air regulator, the Civil Aeronautics Administration, Jean Shen.

Visibility as the plane approached was 1,600 meters (one mile), which met standards for landing, and two flights had landed shortly before GE222, the aviation agency said.

The Central News Agency, citing the county fire department, said it appeared heavy rain reduced visibility and the pilot was forced to pull up and attempt a second landing.

The plane showed no defects and there was ample visibility to land safely, said Lee, the air agency spokesman.

In the village of Xixi, where the plane came down, television stations showed disaster crews picking through the remains of the aircraft cabin, demolished houses and a smashed car.

The airline said it was offering the family of each victim about $6,600 and paying another $27,000 for funeral expenses.

Taiwan's last major aviation disaster was also near Penghu. In 2002, a China Airlines Boeing 747 broke apart in midair and crashed into the Taiwan Strait, killing all 225 people aboard.
