George Foreman says he sees similarities between his famous 'Rumble in the Jungle' with Muhammad Ali and Qatar staging the 2022 World Cup.

Heavyweight greats Foreman and Ali headed to Zaire 40 years ago for an amazing sporting spectacle that no-one thought could possibly be staged in the middle of Africa.

There has been similar shock around the globe at Qatar bringing the World Cup to the Middle East and, at a meeting in Zurich on Monday, FIFA was advised by its medical experts for the tournament to be moved away from the Arab state's searing summer temperatures and played in winter for the first time.

But Foreman believes the cynicism will disappear when Qatar stages the World Cup - just like it did four decades ago when he was knocked out by Ali in the Zairean capital Kinshasa.

'Zaire had the same reputation as being out of the way but once we got there there were modern hotels and everything else,' Foreman said.

'They wanted to show the world we have more here than just the jungle and Qatar is also very smart in this regard.

'The country has so much to offer and there's a lot of things for the tourists to see.

'They do great business and put on great events and the World Cup will highlight it like nothing else.

'The whole world is frightened of going to new places and that's why you put on big sporting events, they can't resist it.

'They must come and see it and that's why sports are so important.

Ali yells 'Ako bo mai ye' before his fight which translates from Zaire's Lingalla dialect as 'I will kill him' 

'There's a lot of ignorance but once you can show the world what you can do it shows you're the same as everyone else.'

Last week marked the 40th anniversary of the classic contest between Ali and Foreman which still resonates today.

The unusual venue and build-up to the fight marked it out as something special and the combatants duly delivered in the ring as Ali upset the odds and the fearsome Foreman with an eighth-round knock-out to become the heavyweight champion of the world for the third time at the age of 32.

Foreman says he is proud to be part of sporting history even though he ended up on the canvas.

'Every year I watch the fight and I keep thinking I'm going to win!' Foreman said at the DohaGOALS 2014 Forum in Qatar.

'It's too bad I lost, but I was part of sports history and every year I'm asked to talk about it.

'It comes alive again and tells me how important the event really was and how happy I am to be part of it.

'I wouldn't have changed anything in my life - apart from beating Ali - and we became good friends after the fight.

'When you're boxing you're so motivated and so jealous, but when you finish you realise you have so much in common.

'We were both heavyweight champions of the world, so why can't we be the best of friends?

'The last time I spoke to him on the telephone I said 'I want a re-match'. He said 'Be quiet. You're crazy!'

Foreman, however, does have one regret these days - and that's boxing is not what it was any more.

'When I fought it was a special time for boxing,' Foreman said.

'I miss that excitement in the heavyweight division, it's not there, but I hope we're going to get another champion who could be another Muhammad Ali or George Foreman.

'Mike Tyson was good but it didn't last long and the Klitschko brothers have been too good for everyone else.

'I've not made a lot of Anthony Joshua yet as hasn't developed into a personality, but once he does that the sky's the limit for him.'
