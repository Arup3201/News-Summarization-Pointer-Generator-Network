Northern Ireland police announced Thursday they will sue to obtain all of the audiotaped interviews of former militants who described their wartime careers to a Boston College oral history project, a move designed to reopen scores of "cold case" murder investigations in the British territory.

Police last year successfully sued Boston College to obtain 11 interviews of Irish Republican Army veterans discussing the 1972 abduction, killing and secret burial of Jean McConville, a 38-year-old Belfast widowed mother of 10.

Those tapes were used as a primary basis for arresting Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who had been accused by some IRA interviewees of being the Belfast IRA commander at the time who ordered McConville's slaying.

Adams denied the accusations and was released without charge May 4, although police did send an evidence file to British state prosecutors for potential charges later.

Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams was released without charge Sunday 
earlier this month following his suspected involvement in a 
decades-old IRA killing of a Belfast mother of 10. The Police Service of Northern Island were granted access to confidential tapes recorded by Boston College - and now want the rest

The Boston College (pictured) archive contains 180 interviews with former paramilitaries, 
six percent of which concern the murder of Irish mother Jean McConville. After gaining access to 11 of the tapes, the Police Service of Northern Ireland is now suing for access to the rest

Helen McKendry - daughter of Jean McConville, who was murdered by the IRA - said she wanted the people responsible for her mother's 'torture' to be brought before a court of law

Now, the Police Service of Northern Ireland says it wants the entire audio archive, including the accounts of former Ulster Volunteer Force members involved in the slayings of Catholic civilians.

In a statement it said Serious Crime Branch detectives were doing this because of the police's 'statutory duty to investigate fully all matters of serious crime, including murder'.

The move threatened to open up another legal can of worms for Boston College and the two officials who collected the oral history: journalist Ed Moloney and IRA veteran Anthony McIntyre.

Dozens of IRA veterans and Protestant militants agreed to speak to McIntyre starting in 2001 on condition their interviews be kept secret until their deaths.

Some of those interviewed have said they plan to sue Boston College to have the tapes and any other records of their interviews returned or destroyed.

Boston College faced criticism over its decision to hand over the tapes concerning Mrs McConville's murder to the PSNI, because they were meant to remain sealed

Boston College itself said it was willing to return the interviews to their subjects.

Thursday's police move appears designed to prevent that from happening.

NBC News this month initiated its own legal processings seeking access to parts of the Northern Ireland audio archive at Boston College.

In its May 6 letter to Judge William Young, the Boston judge who presided over most of the Northern Ireland police-Boston College legal tussle, NBC News said it wanted to see all transcripts, audio recordings and documents that had already been provided to the Northern Ireland police for the McConville investigation.
