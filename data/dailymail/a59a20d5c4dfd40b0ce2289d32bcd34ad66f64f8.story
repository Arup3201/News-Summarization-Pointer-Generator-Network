Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy last year after learning she had the BRCA gene mutation. Women with it should have their ovaries removed by the time they are 35, not 40, researchers claim

Women who have genetic mutations that put them at risk of ovarian cancer have less time to have their ovaries removed than previously thought.

Women with the BRCA gene mutations are currently advised to make the decision as to whether to have the surgery by the time they are 40.

Now, Canadian researchers say the decision should be made by the age of 35.

They say that women with BRCA1 mutations who wait until after age 35 are five times more likely to develop ovarian cancer than those who have the surgery before 35.

The research, which involved studying 5,783 women, also revealed they are four times more likely to die early than those who have the surgery before the age of 35.

Overall, the surgery reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 80 per cent and the risk of premature death from any cause by 77 per cent, according to the study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

‘For women with BRCA1 mutations, these results suggest that surgery should be performed as soon as it is practical,’ said Dr Don Dizon, a spokesman for the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

He added that the surgery ‘carries long-lasting benefits, substantially reducing ovarian cancer risk as well as total mortality risk’.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are widely known as breast cancer genes, and women with a mutation in one or both often decide to have their breasts removed so they do not develop that disease.

Last year actress Angelina Jolie went public with her decision to undergo a mastectomy after she tested positive for a BRCA mutation.

Mutations in the same genes also increase the risk of ovarian cancer.

Removing the ovaries is not only major surgery, like mastectomy, but also triggers menopause. And it makes conceiving children impossible.

‘Our strongest instincts are for survival and reproduction, and women facing this decision have to balance those,’ said Dr Noah Kauff, director of ovarian cancer screening and prevention at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York City who was not involved in the new study.

The findings about the benefit of ovary removal by age 35 apply to women with mutations in the BRCA1 gene, not BRCA2.

Current guidelines give women a few more years to make the difficult decision.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that the one in 300 to 800 women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation be offered prophylactic ovary removal by age 40 or when childbearing is complete.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends an age of 35 to 40.

Studies that support those recommendations found that surgery reduces the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. But the new research is the first to show a reduction in overall mortality.

To me, waiting to have [the surgery] until after 35 is too much of a chance to take,’ said Dr Steven Narod of the University of Toronto, who led the study. ‘These data are so striking that we believe [ovary removal] by age 35 should become a universal standard for women with BRCA1 mutations.’

Other experts are not so sure.

For one thing, the risk of ovarian cancer in BRCA1 women who waited until 40 to have their ovaries removed was still small at 1.5 per cent.

It was 3.8 per cent for women who had the operation in their 40s and 14.2 per cent in women who waited until 50.

For women without a BRCA mutation, the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1.4 per cent.

‘We've always known that the earlier [surgery] is performed, the greater the protection against both breast and ovarian cancer,’ said Dr Kauff. ‘But you don't fall off a cliff at age 35 or even 40.’

The study, he warned, may overestimate the benefits of early surgery.

Women who had surgery before age 35 but nevertheless developed an aggressive cancer and died soon thereafter were unlikely to be among the 5,783 in the study, he pointed out since they had already died.

The study was therefore blind to these women's bad outcome despite early surgey and as a result overestimated the benefit of pre-35 surgery.

But even with that caveat, Dr Kauff said: ‘The risk of ovarian cancer probably rises one to two per cent for every year you wait beyond 40.’
