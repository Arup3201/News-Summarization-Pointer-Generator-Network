A mother in Texas has made history by giving birth to two sets of identical twins in one day.

Tressa Montalvo, 36, defied the odds of one in 70 million to have her four sons, who were born on Valentine's Day, and were originally believed to be quadruplets.

She and her husband Manuel, 43, had decided to have another child in order to give their son Memphis a little brother or sister.

But couple got more than they bargained for - and their son now has four baby brothers.

While extremely rare, delivering two sets of identical twins isn’t unheard of.

In April, 2011, Miranda and Josh Crawford of Charlotte, North Carolina, gave birth to identical twin girls and identical twin boys after undergoing IVF.

In 2002, Christina Tetrick of Wichita, Kansas, was pregnant with two sets of identical twin boys.

The odds of having non-identical twins are one in 80; with identical twins this rises to one in every 240 cases.

With identical twins, a single egg splits just before it implants in the uterus, Basky Thilaganathan, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynacecologists told MailOnline.

He said: 'In the case of this couple however, two eggs were fertilised by the sperm and then BOTH decided to split before they were implanted, the odds of which are roughly around one in 70 million.'

In terms of the risks, because identical twins can share an amniotic sac and a placenta, they are at risk of becoming tangled in each others’ umbilical cords and suffer twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome — a rare placental disease that results in one twin getting less blood than the other.

The quadruplets Ace, Blaine, Cash and
 Dylan were delivered at 31 weeks by Caesarean section at the The 
Woman's Hospital of Texas.

'We tried to stick to the A-B-C-D theme when naming them,' said Mrs Montalvo.

Ace and Blaine were born at 8:51am, weighing 3lb 10oz and 3lb 15oz; Cash and Dylan were just one minute
 behind, weighing 2lbs 15oz and 3lb 6oz.

Mrs Montalvo and her husband thought they were having twins until their doctor detected a third heartbeat. 

They were then referred to specialist, Dr Brian Kirshon, who found a fourth heartbeat.

'We couldn’t have been more surprised when Dr. Kirshon told us we were having four babies and that they were two sets of twins,' Mr Montalvo said.

'We were trying for one little brother or sister for our two-and-a-half year old son, Memphis.

'We didn’t expect it, we were trying for just one and we were blessed with four.'

Around two per cent of all pregnancies result in one set of identical twins, when a fertilised egg splits into two embryos. 

The Woman's Hospital of Texas said 
the odds of delivering two sets of naturally identical twins is 
somewhere in the range of one in 70 million.

But the Montalvos’ pregnancy was completely natural.

'No fertility drugs were used. We planned the pregnancy — I guess we just succeeded a little too much,' Mr Montalvo said.

The odds of having non-identical twins are one in 80; with identical twins this rises to one in every 240 cases.

With identical twins, a single egg splits just before it implants in the uterus, Basky Thilaganathan, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynacecologists told MailOnline.

He said: 'In the case of this couple,
 two eggs were fertilised by the sperm and then both decided to split 
before they were implanted, the odds of which are indeed somewhere in the region of one in 
70 million.'

He added that the process has nothing
 to do with IVF; multiple births from that tend to occur due to more 
than one egg being artificially inseminated, rather than an egg 
splitting. This is why most IVF twins are non-identical. 

Because
 the two sets of babies came from two eggs, they would not be classed as
 quadruplets, which generally come from four separate eggs, he added.

But while they now have five boys to look after the Mr and Mrs Montalvo say they are not finished yet.

'We want a girl,' said Mr Montalvo.

In the past ten years, The Woman’s 
Hospital of Texas has delivered more than 2,800 sets of multiples.

'Our
 physicians, nurses and staff have been providing care exclusively to 
women and infants for more than 35 years,' said hospital CEO, Linda 
Russell.

'This is what we do every day. We have the top specialists and an integrated continuum of care to make sure families like the Montalvos are getting excellent care.

'We want our families to feel confident that they are in the most capable hands.'
