What started out as a joke to organise a wedding on just £10 has now become a reality for one thrifty couple.

Kelsey Courtney and Alice Flannigan believed their longed-for wedding was something they would have to save years for, but now they have just 10 weeks to prepare.

The North Tyneside pair, who have been together for almost four years, were chatting and joking with family members when the topic of marriage came up.

The couple thought they would have to save for years to wed and the idea of getting married on a shoe string budget started as a joke

(L-R) Alice, wedding planner Angela Evans, Kelsey, and Lynn Blundell, who are delighted with the donations received so far for the wedding- including the wedding dress!

But little did they know a flippant comment from Lynn Blundell, Kelsey’s sister, would change their plans quite so dramatically.

Kelsey said: 'We were just sitting round the table and I said to Alice ‘do you want to marry me’? And she said ‘what, with £10’? 

'Then Lynn says she’d bet she could do it with a tenner so I told her ‘go on then’.'

That was only four days ago and Lynn, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, has already managed to secure a wedding dress, bridesmaids dresses, a reception venue, caterer, DJ, cake, a wedding planner and many more aspects of a wedding that usually take months to source.

Lynn says: 'I thought I would try putting something on Facebook to see if anyone had any ideas and it just went from there'

The 38-year-old never expected the task, which she has dubbed ‘The £10 Wedding Challenge’, to take off so quickly.

She said: 'At first I thought there was no way I was going to do this but I thought I would try putting something on Facebook to see if anyone had any ideas and it just went from there.

'I really didn’t think I would be able to pull it off before the wedding date in October, but it’s only been three days since I started and almost everything is sorted.'

The mum-of-one took to social networking sites to appeal for people and businesses to lend their support and within no time offers were flooding in from generous folk across the region who wanted to help make Kelsey and Alice’s dream wedding come true.

Lynn added: 'With all the bad that’s in the world at the minute, it just shows there’s a hell of a lot of good people out there.'

Kelsey and Alice are planning to wed on Thursday, October 31, and although the location is yet to be finalised there are a several options available to them.

The couple are over the moon at all Lynn has done for them so far and have been bowled over by people’s kindness.

'We’ve been engaged for two-and-a-half years and we were planning to save £50-a-month towards a wedding, so it would’ve been a few years off,' said Kelsey.

'It’s absolutely amazing what’s happened.'

Partner Alice has already received the dress she will wear for the ceremony which was donated by Kerry Mannion.

'It’s an amazing dress with a really long train. I’m a bit nervous and excited at the minute,' she said.

Other people who have also given items or services for free include Gibside Video, Caroline Blondie, Julie Coxon Telford, QRF Elite Services, Angela Evans, Anne Grady, Jennifer McCabe Sharp, Georgie Leigh Ward, The Victoria pub, Cassie Gill, Loulabelles Occasions, Murray Wilson, Louise Schofield and many more.
