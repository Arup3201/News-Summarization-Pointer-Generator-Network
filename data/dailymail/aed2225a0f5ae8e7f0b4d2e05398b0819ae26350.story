David Cameron's ‘right-hand man’ in Brussels has provoked fury by insisting Britain will definitely remain in the EU after the promised referendum in 2017.

Lord Hill suggested that the result of the vote was a foregone conclusion.

Ukip claimed the Tory peer had ‘let the cat out of the bag’, saying the comments proved that the Prime Minister’s real plan was to keep us in the EU no matter what.

Lord Hill told MEPs that the EU will remain a family of 28 member states in 2019 - including the United Kingdom

Downing Street insists that the only way to get a plebiscite on EU membership is to vote Conservative at the next election.

Lord Hill made his prediction as he was grilled for a second time by MEPs, who had to ratify his appointment as EU commissioner for financial services. He set out his vision for Europe in 2019 to show how he would work to beef up the EU.

He said: ‘Big picture for 2019: the European Union is stronger and more cohesive – and more responsive to the economic and political concerns of its citizens. And our Union, by the way, remains a family of 28 member states – including the United Kingdom.’

Mr Cameron has pledged tough negotiations to claw back powers from Brussels, such as controls on movement across the continent. An in-out referendum would then be held by the end of 2017.

But Ukip’s Douglas Carswell said Lord Hill’s confident prediction that Britain will remain in the EU showed that the vote was a sham.

Mr Carswell, who defected from the Tories to Ukip and is standing in tomorrow’s Clacton by-election, said: ‘This confirms what I said when I resigned: that the inner clique have an underhand plan to keep us in the EU.

‘They are promising us a referendum and they are talking the language of change – but in reality they are doing everything they can to keep us in. His lordship has let the cat out of the bag.

‘One of the reasons I left the Conservative Party was when I realised it was all smoke and mirrors. I couldn’t be part of it any longer.’

Eurosceptic Conservatives were also angered by the comments.

Conservative MP Peter Bone, pictured, said the future of Britain in Europe will be down to the electorate 

Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘Whilst Lord Hill is entitled to his opinion, frankly under David Cameron’s referendum it will not be Lord Hill who decides – it’ll be the British people.

‘I’ll have a 10p bet with Lord Hill that come 2017 we’ll be out of Europe and the country will be heading for a better future.

‘It seems as though Lord Hill will make an excellent EU commissioner because he is already talking the language of the EU elite, because he thinks his views matter more than the British people.’

After a first hearing last week, Lord Hill was summoned back to the European Parliament because MEPs wanted further assurances that he would not solely fight Britain and the City’s corner after taking up his commission post on November 1. Under pressure from MEPs, he has distanced himself from ‘double majority’ voting in the EU’s banking authority, a key concession won by Britain last year.

It means that for important banking regulation to pass, a ‘double majority’ of eurozone and non-eurozone countries must support it, protecting the City from discrimination by Frankfurt or Paris.

The measure was introduced after a protracted battle by Chancellor George Osborne to prevent the eurozone acting as a voting bloc on financial regulation following last year’s ‘banking union’ for members of the single currency.

The Conservative peer wrote to MEPs: ‘If confirmed, I will be a European commissioner, serving the general interest, not any one member state’s interest.’

But Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP, said: ‘He is too close to Cameron and can’t do this job. There needs to be a reshuffle to move him elsewhere.’
