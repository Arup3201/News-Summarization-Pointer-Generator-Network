Martin Kimber is to step down as chief executive of Rotherham Borough Council in the wake of a report detailing the sexual exploitation of at least 1,400 children in the town, the authority said.

Mr Kimber's position with the council had been under the spotlight in recent weeks with the release of a damning report into widespread and systemic sexual abuse which occurred in the town in the 1990s and 2000s.

It is the latest in a series of resignations of public officials who were involved with the council at the time of the abuse.

However, the office of Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright has reiterated he has no intention to step down from his role, despite the mounting public pressure.

At least 1,400 girls were left to be abused by Asian men because the authorities were too scared to admit there was a race issue, a recent report said.

Martin Kimber, the chief executive of Rotherham Borough Council, will leave his post in December

Over a 16-year period, children as young as 11 were sexually exploited by gangs of men – most of them of Pakistani origin.

But police and council officials suppressed evidence of the crimes because they feared being labelled racist. 

Mr Kimber, who joined Rotherham Borough Council in 2009, said: 'I believe that new leadership will enable the town to recover more quickly from the events of the last two weeks, and strongly signal a new beginning at this critical time in its recovery.'

A council spokesperson said Mr Kimber had only just informed staff of his decision this morning and details of any leaving payoff had not yet been discussed.

Professor Alexis Jay's report outlined how hundreds of children had been subjected to trafficking, rape and other sexual exploitation between 1997 and 2013 and how their plight had been ignored by range of agencies, including police, councillors and council officials.

Mr Kimber, who has been at the forefront of the council's response to the Jay Report since it was published a fortnight ago, will leave his post at the end of December.

He offered an unreserved apology from the authority at a press conference immediately following its release.

Mr Kimber has been at the forefront of the council's response to the report since its release a fortnight ago

Today he said: 'The report does not make comfortable reading in its account of the horrific experiences of some young people in the past, and I would like to reiterate my sincere apology to those who were let down when they needed help.

'The events of the past fortnight will again have been an incredibly traumatic time for them and their families, and have shaken the town as a whole.

'The council has now decided what it must do to give the best possible protection for the children and young people of Rotherham. I believe that new leadership will enable the town to recover more quickly from the events of the last two weeks, and strongly signal a new beginning at this critical time in its recovery. The time is therefore now right for me to leave.

'I will be sorry to leave Rotherham but firmly believe that this will leave the council in a stronger position in the future. It is therefore the right thing to do in the interests of the people of the town.

Mr Kimber said he was committed to supporting his colleagues at Rotherham Council (pictured) over the next three months

'I remain committed to supporting colleagues over the next three months. There is no more important job for this council than to ensure it continues to work with partners to seek justice for those young people and their families who are affected by this vile crime, and to give our vulnerable children and young people the protection they deserve.'

Mr Kimber was Director of Environmental Services at Wigan before moving into the post in Rotherham in July 2009, taking over from Mike Cuff, who retired after five years in the post.

He was previously Assistant Director of Planning and Transportation at Barnsley Council before moving to Wigan.

He is the latest of several high profile public officials to step down in the wake of the scandal.

Council leader Roger Stone resigned in the immediate aftermath of the report, as did Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire, Tracey Cheetham.

Since then there have been top-level calls for others in senior positions during the 16 years covered by the report to step down, especially South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), Shaun Wright.

South Yorkshire Police commissioner Shaun Wright - who was in charge of Rotherham's children's services from 2005 - 2010, has refused to step down

Before he was elected as PCC, Mr Wright was a councillor in Rotherham for more than a decade and the cabinet member with responsibility for children's services from 2005 to 2010.

Prime Minister David Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May and Labour leader Ed Miliband have all called for Mr Wright to resign.

When Labour threatened to drop him last week, Mr Wright resigned from the party. 

He Mr Wright defiantly repeated his refusal to quit and insisted he will complete his term of office - but announced that he will not seek re-election to the £85,000-a-year post in 2016.

His office said today his decision to not step down had not changed in the wake of Mr Kimber's resignation.

The 46-year-old previously apologised for his role in the ‘systematic failure’ which allowed the scandal to go undetected for so long, adding: ‘I wish I knew then what I do now.’

He will face questions from MPs tomorrow about his knowledge of the Rotherham child abuse scandal when he appears before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee.

Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'The revelations from the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham are deeply troubling.

'The committee will be questioning those in positions of authority at the time that these offences were being committed on how the sexual exploitation of children on a horrifying scale was allowed to go unchallenged for so long.

'We will also be hearing from Sir Peter Wanless and Richard Whittam QC about progress in their ongoing review of how the Home Office handled historical allegations of child abuse.'
