An Operation Desert Storm veteran has been fined $5,000 for having trees in front of his house shorter than allowed by his home owner’s association.

Patrick Fitzgerald, 51, of Merritt Island, Florida, found himself at odds with the HOA earlier this year after they cited him for having trees shorter than the minimum required six-foot height for new plantings.

Bad blood on both sides of the dispute has led Mr Fitzgerald to call the HOA ‘idiots’ and for the association to call the situation ‘ludicrous.’

'I love these trees': Patrick Fitzgerald says he doesn't understand how a few smaller trees can have such a big impact on property values

‘I love these trees,’ Mr Fitzgerald told WESH while standing next to his prized magnolias, which he planted about a year ago.

The man was fined $100 per tree per day until the bill came to $5,000, according to WESH.

The trees stand only three-feet-tall, a full three-feet shorter than allowed by the HOA, according to the station.

River Grove Association rules require every street to be lined with trees of similar height spaced an equal distance apart from each other.

'Throughout the association there are live oaks and magnolia trees that are 10 to 15 foot height,' the HOA president told ABC.

'They've taken root and are getting pretty big, so they don't want minor seedlings being planted,' he added.

Half the required height: Mr Fitzgerald's magnolias are just under three-feet-tall, they need to be six-feet-tall

Mr Fitzgerald admitted to ABC News that he did not entirely read the homeowner‘s guidelines when he bought the house.

‘I don't know about you, but I didn't go through every single page,’ he told ABC.

The former soldier the station he planted smaller trees because he believes they will be healthier than taller trees recently planted in other areas of River Grove that are in poor health.

But the association disagrees.

‘Mr Fitzgerald wanted to make a nursery out of an area controlled by the HOA and we said no,’ a spokesperson told WESH.

He planted the trees despite being told no, drew huge fines and even spent $2,000 on a lawyer to argue his case during a mediation hearing – still, the trees must go.

Up to code: The association requires homeowners to have trees of equal height and spacing lining all streets

They must go: Mr Fitzgerald's lawyer worked out a deal requiring him to remove the trees within 20 days to avoid paying the fine

‘I came back to this country after (serving in Iraq) and it’s funny I don’t have the right to plant a tree in front of my house,’ said the veteran. ‘There’s something wrong there.’

The HOA again disagrees.

‘This has gotten so carried away it is absolutely ridiculous,’ the association’s president told ABC News. ‘To me it's ludicrous.’

‘We're not a bunch of idiots.’ The president added. ‘We're just a bunch of neighbors trying to keep property values where they are,.’

This is where Mr Fitzgerald draws his line in the sand.

‘I don’t think they’re bringing down property value,’ he told WESH.

Mr Fitzgerald's lawyer worked out a deal with the HOA where he has 20 days to remove the trees and avoid the fine, something he will begrudgingly adhere to, he told ABC.
