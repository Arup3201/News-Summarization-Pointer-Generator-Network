Mauricio Pochettino wants Ryan Mason to trust his body-strength after escaping what initially appeared to be a serious ankle injury.

Mason had to be helped from the pitch during the first half of Tottenham's win against Burnley on Saturday, fearing a major set-back just as his career was taking off.

But Pochettino has confirmed there is no major damage to the ligaments and hopes to have the 23-year-old midfielder back in his team before the festive fixtures are over.

'He's stronger than he believes,' said the Spurs boss. 'He twisted his ankle and suffered a lot of pain but luckily no damage.

'We show him that he has improved his physical condition from the beginning of the season.

'But we need to be careful because it is his first season in the Premier League.'

Mason's early career was blighted by niggling injuries often around his ankles, which delayed his progress, but Pochettino, having identified him during the pre-season camp, put him on a personal fitness programme.

When he was Southampton manager, the Argentine did the same thing to help Luke Shaw overcome a sequence of muscular strains which have resurfaced since his transfer to Manchester United.

Mason, who remains a doubt for the game at Leicester on Boxing Day, has started Tottenham's last 12 Barclays Premier League games and has struck a good understanding with Nabil Bentaleb.

'It is to the credit to the club and the staff,' said Pochettino. 'The first thing is that you believe in the player and the player feels confidence and after that, every day, we try to help analyse his weaknesses and how he can improve.'
