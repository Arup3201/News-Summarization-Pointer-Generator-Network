It costs the same as a terraced house in Manchester, an Aston Martin Coupe - or even a year's salary for five newly-qualified nurses.

A property in one of London's most exclusive areas is being rented out during the Olympic Games - for £100,000 a week.

Even for Mayfair - a district inhabited by the super-rich - the rate being asked for is staggering. It is the equivalent of almost £10 a minute and is 150 per cent higher than its usual going rate of £40,000 a week.

Cashing in: It could become the most expensive rental deal in London's property history

If anyone is willing to pay the extraordinary sum, the property in Brick Street, Mayfair, will make history by ushering in the era of the six-figure weekly rental.

It will become the most expensive rental deal in London’s property history, beating the £75,000 a week which Sol Campbell, the former Spurs and Arsenal defender, is asking for to rent his townhouse in Chelsea during the Games.

Earlier this month it emerged how 
London landlords are evicting tenants to cash in on the Olympic Games by
charging tourists a fortune to stay in the properties close to the 
competition.

Homes
in the east London boroughs where many events are to be held are 
fetching between five and 15 times their typical rates as properties are
re-branded as short-term Olympic lets.

Some
landlords are also apparently enforcing expensive 'penalty' clauses for
tenants who want to remain during the gathering of the world's top 
athletes.

With rent controls almost non-existent 
in Britain, some Londoners believe the looming increase 
in housing costs will leave them with no choice but to leave the city 
for the summer.

The 
Olympic Village will house some 22,000 athletes along with 6,000 coaches
and officials, but countless tourists, athletes' families, journalists and 
sponsors will be left to jostle with 7.8 million residents for places to
sleep.

Some residents are even planning to rent out their gardens to campers during the Games - which start on July 27 - because they are expecting the accommodation crunch to be so severe.

The immaculate three-storey Brick Street house, which is usually let at £40,000 a week by estate agents Knight Frank, has seven bedrooms, two dressing rooms, seven bathrooms and three reception rooms.

Should the tenants get bored during the Games they will be able to entertain themselves with facilities including a cinema, games room, bar, gym, swimming pool, solarium and steam and sauna room.

It is understood there have already been viewings of the property and its owner is considering an offer for a two-week Olympic let. Meanwhile Savills estate agents are in the process of agreeing a deal in the region of £40,000 a week for a six bedroom penthouse overlooking Hyde Park. Its usual going rate for a long let is £25,000 a week.

The £35 million property has five reception rooms, two kitchens (one at either end of the property, presumably to save the bother of walking its considerable length each time you want a cup of tea) and six bedroom suites including a master bedroom with matching his and hers bathrooms and dressing rooms.

There is also a library, a screening room, a massage room, a fully equipped gym, a spa room, six terraces and a roof garden.

Mark Tunstall of Savills said: 'The tenants for this sort of property are generally from the ex-Soviet bloc — Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine — with a smattering from the Middle East.'
