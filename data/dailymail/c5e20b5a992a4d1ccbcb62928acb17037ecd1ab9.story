Three couples who married on the same day, in the same church, have together celebrated 180 years of marriage in what could be Britain's only combined triple diamond wedding anniversary.

The trio of blushing brides and grooms had never met before they tied the knot in turn on March 30, 1964 but have remained life-long friends ever since.

Stewart and Mary Chugg, both 70, Frank and Sandra Smale, also 70, and Patrick Parsley, 71, and wife Eileen, 69, went down the aisle within hours of one another.

Still in together after all these years: Stewart and Mary Chugg, Frank and Sandra Smale and Patrick and Eileen Parsley (left to right) became lifelong friends after marrying on the same day at the same church fifty years ago

The three couples remained friends and still live in the same town and their marriages endured - and they all met up last week to mark their six decades of marital bliss.

Mrs Smale said: 'We just feel blessed we are still here and able to celebrate.

'I would imagine it is quite unusual for three couples to be celebrating 50 years together, and it is quite a milestone.'

All six were born and raised in the pretty North Devon town of Barnstaple.

Their
 wedding venue, tiny St Mary's Church, has long since been demolished 
but the three marriages are all rock solid after 50 years.

Their
 back-to back nuptials happened partly by chance because the frugal 
lovebirds wanted to take advantage of a tax break for married couples.

With
 the financial perk due to run out on April 1 they were forced to book 
their weddings for the same day, with an hour's interval between each 
service.

Special day: Stewart and Mary Chugg, 
Frank and Sandra Smale and Patrick and Eileen Parsley, in the same order as above, were all wed at 
the now demolished St Mary's in Barnstaple, Devon

50 years on they are still friends and met for a drink last week  to celebrate their anniversaries.

They then held larger celebrations with their own families in the town they love.

Eileen Parsley said: 'We met up and talked about old times in Barnstaple. It was lovely.

'It was very nice because we all come from Barnstaple and we are all born and bred here.

'We just feel blessed we are still here and able to celebrate'.

The longevity of their marriages is remarkable.

In 1964 one in 12 ended in divorce. Today one in two marriages ends in divorce
