Glenn Murray is a striker who the majority of sides in the Championship would love to have in their midst.

Luckily for Nigel Adkins and Reading it is they who can call upon the on-loan Crystal Palace man. A good job, really, given he thundered in a late equaliser on an afternoon that had it all.

When Palace won promotion to the Premier League two years ago, Murray was the star with 31 goals. The Royals would be foolish not to talk numbers when a chance arises to make this move permanent in January. If he carries on scoring — that is three in four now — there is no reason why they cannot bounce back to the top tier.

Adkins is already indebted to him. The ball broke to the 31-year-old on the edge of the box as we crept towards stoppage time and he viciously let fly to earn a point.

‘He’s settled in extremely well and is forming a great partnership with Simon Cox,’ said Adkins. ‘We’ve got threats in the team to go and score goals.’ You sense he was downplaying Murray’s impact.

The hosts had been there for the taking before Murray’s late intervention, and Wolves should be celebrating breaking into the automatic promotion places this morning. 

But Kenny Jackett’s side rather threw away a golden opportunity to go level with Norwich City at the summit. ‘We’d love to be top but won’t let it bother us,’ he said.

Wanderers went ahead twice after initially falling behind, but on both occasions they surrendered their lead. It is games like these that may determine whether the newboys can keep pace at the top.

The way in which they sought a fourth reveals a potential naivety Jackett needs to eradicate quickly. The manager, however, was quick to reject those claims after the game. ‘If you drop off they can throw men forward. You can’t just defend,’ he reasoned. ‘We’re disappointed.’

These two sides hurled men forward all game. It was a captivating contest from start to finish and points towards clubs who have the character and quality to do some damage this season. Positive signs for Reading’s new Thai owners — several of whom were here at the Madejski.

Defending had long gone out the window. Wolves were dozy in not switching on to Jordan Obita’s short corner with Oliver Norwood before the latter whipped in wonderfully from the right, allowing young central defender Michael Hector to steal a yard at the near post and head home.

It was a sweet moment for the 22-year-old, netting a first goal for the club that brought him through its academy.

Wolves, too narrow and one-paced, struggled to really get a grip on this until the break. Just after it, Bakary Sako was finally afforded time to run at Chris Gunter on the left, drilling a cross low towards James Henry at the back post who duly obliged. That sparked a stunning four minutes as the away end — heavily populated with 1,800 visiting supporters — went berserk.

Even more so three minutes after, with Lee Evans calmly slotting in a second after finding himself unmarked on the penalty spot. But Jake Taylor equalised straight from the restart, slotting under Carl Ikeme to cap off a ‘fantastic goal’ according to his manager.

Nick Blackman was unfortunate to divert a corner into his own net with six minutes remaining, but it was left for Murray — dispensed with by Palace so they could sign Kevin Doyle — to have the final word.

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND

Bristol City, who have enjoyed the dubious title of serious underachievers for years given the size of their catchment area, finally look as if they are ready to bounce back into the second tier. 

Steve Cotterill’s side are already five points clear at the top of League One after beating MK Dons 3-2 at Ashton Gate, thanks to a winner from stalwart Wade Elliott seconds after the visitors had drawn level.

WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE

SAMI HYYPIA is finally having an impact on the Brighton back four after the Seagulls held Nottingham Forest to a goalless draw at the City Ground.

RUSSELL SLADE — who left Leyton Orient last week — was in the stands to watch Cardiff record their first win in six against Sheffield Wednesday. He looks primed to take over following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s departure. 

JOHN COLEMAN marked his return to Accrington Stanley by beating Plymouth thanks to a Kai Naismith strike. Life without James Beattie is going smoothly in east Lancashire — they’ve won four of their last five.
