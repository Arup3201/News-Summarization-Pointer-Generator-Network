When Louis van Gaal has time between figuring out the Angel di Maria conundrum and plotting Manchester United’s Champions League return, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink would love a coffee.

Hasselbaink is keen to pick the brains of his former coach, in his words one of the world’s greatest, to help League Two Burton Albion’s promotion push. 

The former Dutch international is doing pretty well so far by himself in his first managerial job in England, leading Burton to top spot since surprisingly taking over in November.

But getting advice from the United manager with whom he shares a bond can only help.

‘I was always one of his favourites,’ smiles Hasselbaink, who won most of his 23 Holland caps under Van Gaal. ‘He wanted to sign me for Barcelona from Chelsea in 2003. I will never forget this. The fee was already arranged, then they played Valencia, he lost at home, he got the sack, and the deal didn’t go through.’

Does Hasselbaink recognise the prickly Van Gaal we have seen during low ebbs this season? His face lights up. ‘He is mild! I’m telling you,’ he says. ‘I have not spoken to him yet. I need to find the time to go over to Manchester and have a cup of coffee or tea with him when he is not that busy.

‘He is somebody who tells you exactly what he wants, how he wants and when he wants. There are no prisoners. But he is a very loving man and a top coach, one of the best in the world.

‘Of course he has come in for criticism because he is manager of one of the biggest clubs in the world, but let’s not forget, Man United is changing. I am 100 per cent he will succeed and they will play attractive football.’

Hasselbaink would hope players under his guidance one day say similar things about him. At 43, his managerial career is embryonic. He was a novice when he took the reins, despite a year at Royal Antwerp in Belgium.

His first fortnight at Burton brought challenges even the most experienced manager might have found daunting. In his debut training session goalkeeper Dean Lyness broke his leg. ‘He is a guy who everybody really likes so that was a big blow,’ says Hasselbaink. ‘But he is back training and getting stronger.’

Then, just days after his first match in charge, at Wycombe, there was an emotionally crushing event — the funeral of Lydia Bennett, a 17-year-old who played for Burton’s women’s team. She had collapsed and died at home on November 4.

‘That was devastating,’ says Hasselbaink, his eyes dewy. ‘I have an 18-year-old and for somebody to lose their child at that age is not right.’ He bangs the table.

‘That was very hard. The only thing I could do was go to the funeral and represent the club the right way. I still have Lydia’s black armband in my office hung up. We see it everyday. You get reminded of the real things in life. At times we forget.’

To hear Hasselbaink talk with such sensitivity only underlines why chairman Ben Robinson selected him ahead of 60 other applicants when predecessor Gary Rowett left for Birmingham. Robinson has a knack here, also giving Neil Warnock and Nigel Clough their breaks in management.

Hasselbaink’s motivation to plunge into the lower divisions was not obvious. This is a man who scored so many Premier League goals for Leeds United, Chelsea, Middlesbrough and Charlton (127) he still sits 11th on the all-time list, despite retiring seven years ago.

Hasselbaink's yearly earnings are believed to be around £40,000 - minimal compared to his playing days

Money is not the driving factor. When it is suggested he earns in a year what he once earned per week at Chelsea he grins. The figure is believed to be about £40,000 a year.

If he simply wanted to stay in football he could have ticked along with punditry jobs. As recently as last October he was on Match of the Day.

‘As much as I’ve enjoyed the punditry, it’s very easy sitting there and judging people,’ he says. ‘You’re not under pressure. Do you know what has happened in that week’s training? You don’t.

‘So I always wanted to be with the players, seeing them smiling, sweating and, at times, moaning. Yes it’s hard. I love it. The second best thing in football — after playing.’

Still, why Burton? Hasselbaink answers emphatically. ‘It was a great opportunity. A very stable club with ambition, a great chairman who works with his managers, a good squad, excellent training facilities, and you can teach players.

The Burton boss could easily pick up more than he currently earns, but he wants to cut his teeth at lower level

‘I didn’t look at League Two, League One, Championship or whatever. I was always looking at the job. Can I have a Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink feeling there? What’s the identity of the club? Does it fit with me? Do I fit with them?’

We are sitting in an executive suite at Burton’s Pirelli Stadium, a neat ground with 7,000 capacity, opened a decade ago. Training at nearby St George’s Park — the FA centre of excellence costing £105million — has just finished. It does seem to fit.

Hasselbaink finds inspiration in Swansea’s incredible rise through the ranks; bottom of the Football League to established Premier League force in 10 years.

‘Swansea have the perfect model. They have an identity of the club and then they find a manager who fits. A lot of other clubs get a manager because he is doing well. He then wants to change lots of players.

‘Swansea have kept their way of playing. Every manager who has come has tweaked it a bit, but not lost the identity of the club.

‘We are still far, far away from Swansea. But they give smaller clubs hope because of how structured and stable they are. If you plan well you have an opportunity to go far, if you stick with that belief.’

Hasselbaink’s belief in a passing style has seen Burton win 14, draw five and lose three of his matches to date. They can go five points clear at the top if they beat Stevenage at home on Monday night.

‘What has surprised me is that the players are better than people say they are,’ he says. ‘I find that there are some really technical players in League Two.’

He tries to remain cool on the touchline. ‘I want to stay as focused on my team as possible, because that’s where I can affect the game. I’m trying not to swear at the fourth official.

‘So far I’ve been more than good! No four-letter words. As a player I was different and always at it. But that is gone. I try to be as respectable as possible.’

Steve McLaren is another manager Hasselbaink speaks to in order to get advice on coaching

Steve McClaren lives fairly close and ‘at times we go for lunch or a quick supper’, says Hasselbaink. McClaren signed him for Middlesbrough and took him to Nottingham Forest as a coach, his last role in England. McClaren had one response when Hasselbaink asked him about the Burton offer: ‘Take it.’

Hasselbaink says: ‘He’s a very good manager. I pick up a lot but I don’t copy. You have to make things your own. He is somebody I can call if I need to ask advice. Somebody I really respect.’

Ronald Koeman is another Hasselbaink has phoned.

Where he does not wish for assistance, as he sees it, is through the colour of his skin.

Hasselbaink, studying for his UEFA Pro Licence, is one of only five black managers in the Football League, but rejects the proposal of a Rooney Rule that would ensure at least one candidate for each vacancy is from a minority ethnic background.

He says: ‘If I apply for a job I want to get an interview because they think I am the right person. Not because one of the six has to be black. I want to know they want me because they think I can take the club further. Otherwise I don’t need it.’

It would appear Burton, with sights on breaking into the third tier for the first time in their history, need Hasselbaink.
