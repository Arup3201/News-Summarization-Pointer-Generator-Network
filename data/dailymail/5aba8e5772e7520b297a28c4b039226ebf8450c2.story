It's proved so popular in Britain that it has its own theme park and has spawned a massive line of merchandise.

But much-loved childrens' cartoon Peppa Pig will soon be entertaining youngsters in Russia too.

Russia is the latest country to adopt the global phenomenon with the brand's owner, Entertainment One, hoping to tap into what it sees as one of the world's fastest growing merchandise markets.

Global phenomenon: Children's television show Peppa Pig is to be shown on Russian channels

Popular: The cartoon centres on the adventures of Peppa and her family doing everyday activities

The animated series is being launched on Russian television channel Karusel with merchandise such as toys and magazines set to launch in the country in the coming weeks.

The move extends the global profile of the piglet who loves to jump in muddy puddles.

Peppa's popularity initially among UK pre-school children has spread to around 180 territories around the world including the United States and Australia.

The character goes by many different names across the globe, including Miss Pink Pig in China, Prascic Pepa in Croatia, Gurli Gris in Denmark and Swinka Peppa in Polish.

Big business: The brand has a vast range of merchandise available for fans including this inflatable chair

Worldwide brand: As well as being hugely popular in the UK, the Peppa Pig brand is known in 180 territories including Germany where she is known as Peppa Wutz

Much-loved: The Polish version of Peppa Pig is called Swinka Pig

Darren Throop, president and chief executive of Entertainment One - which also owns the Twilight franchise - said: 'As one of the world's fastest emerging markets for licensed merchandise, we see huge potential for the brand in Russia.'

Entertainment One said it was also 
seeking to roll out Peppa merchandising in the Nordics, Italy and Canada
this year.

The company has grown quickly since establishing itself as a
film distribution network in March 2007, taking over Contender, the UK 
content group later that year.

Royal friends: The Queen made a guest appearance in the cartoon to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee

The cartoon, which was originally aired in 2004 on Channel 5 and Nickelodeon Jnr, features the adventures of peppa, her brother George, Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and the rest of the family.

All of her friends are all different species of animals and one episode even saw Peppa make friends with the Queen.

The brand has proved the supplier of huge income for Entertainment One, with the franchise grossing Â£200million in sales in the UK alone in 2010.
