Alex Salmond will demand the power to hold another independence referendum in return for propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street next year.

The outgoing First Minister has revealed his price for the SNP's support should there be a hung parliament following May's General Election.

The move raises the prospect of Mr Miliband facing the unenviable choice of running a majority government or risking another vote on the future of the Union.

Outgoing First Minister Alex Salmond has revealed his price for the SNP's support should there be a hung parliament following May's General Election

Mr Salmond makes his final appearance at First Minister's Questions today  after more than seven years in office.

As his 'divisive' reign comes to an end, Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael has called on his successor Nicola Sturgeon to 'hit the reset button' and fix the relationship between Westminster and Holyrood.

Mr Carmichael blasted the Scottish Government for 'taking its eye off the ball' in recent years and urged ministers to focus on their 'day jobs' now that voters have rejected separation. 

He also singled out Education Secretary Mike Russell for failing to 'respect' the result of the referendum after the minister blamed a fall in teacher numbers on those who support the Union.

But Mr Salmond, 59, used a press conference yesterday to insist that independence will happen within his own lifetime.

He also backtracked from his pre-referendum vow that September's contest was a 'once in a generation, perhaps even a lifetime, opportunity' and said another referendum could happen 'sooner' than Unionist supporters would like.

His comments will alarm more than 2million Scots who turned out to reject independence, many of whom are still recovering from the divisions caused by the constitutional battle.

Mr Salmond is widely expected to launch a bid to return to Westminster as an MP once he hands over power to Miss Sturgeon, where he hopes to be 'kingmaker' following next year's General Election.

In an interview with Newsweek Europe to be published tomorrow, the SNP leader suggests he would also fight for voters in northern England.

'Who knows, there might be one or two things we can knock off for the good citizens of Liverpool and Newcastle, because they badly need a champion of some sort,' he said.

'Is England going to be safer in my hands or in the hands of this coalition government or of Nigel Farage? Much safer in my hands. I'll do my best.'

Ed Miliband has seen a collapse in support for Labour in Scotland, with voters switching to the SNP

The SNP will not enter a formal coalition with the Tories, but has not ruled out a deal with Labour. However, should the arithmetic allow it, a 'confidence and supply' system is more likely where the party's MPs would vote against any no confidence vote in a Labour-led government and would allow its budget to pass.

'There is plenty of scope to find things which are really important to you but are really not that important to the government,' he told Newsweek.

'It wouldn't be the greatest tragedy in the world, for example, for Westminster to accept the reality that the Scottish parliament should run its own elections, its own referendum.'

Elections are currently reserved to Westminster and the recent referendum was only made legally-binding following a temporary deal between David Cameron and Mr Salmond.

The First Minister claimed the threat to the Union by handing over this power would not be of 'immediate pressing concern [to Westminster] compared to the enormity, for example, of Ed Miliband's survival as Prime Minister, which I am sure he would in that situation believe to be of the ultimate importance to the future of everything.'

Last night, a senior Scottish Labour MP said the idea was a non-starter because there would be no mandate to devolve elections and it would be 'going against the settled will of the Scottish voters'.

Mr Carmichael said it is time to leave the constitutional debate behind.

'For us all in politics, there's a job of work to be done now to move Scotland on from being divided between the 55 [per cent who voted No] and the 45, to heal some of the deep and quite understandable divisions that there were in the course of the referendum,' he said.

'With Nicola taking over the reins as SNP leader and then as First Minister next week… I hope that this will be a point when we can hit the reset button on the relationship between the two governments.'

Mr Carmichael criticised comments made by the First Minister about the prospect of another referendum on independence.

'I'm hoping that once some of the dust settles that they will accept that we're not returning to the referendum question any time soon, because principally that would be very bad for Scotland's economy,' he said.

But during a press conference in his official Bute House residence yesterday, Mr Salmond said: 'It's the people who decide whether a constitutional referendum should be held.

'I did see a number of indications in two polls last week that at least there is strong support among the people of Scotland for a constitutional referendum rather sooner.'

Asked if he thought independence would happen within his lifetime, he replied: 'Yes indeed.'
