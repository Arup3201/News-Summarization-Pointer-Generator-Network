The ABC has confirmed that one of its employees was asked to delete a tactless tweet referring to the Sydney siege, that was posted as the event continued to unfold.

Geoff Hutchison, a Perth radio presenter, took to Twitter at about 7:11pm on Monday to mock the media's coverage of the event.

'COMING UP on our #sydneysiege special EXCLUSIVE Bertie Beetle speaks of his fears. 'I could be next,' says compound chocolate icon,' Mr Hutchison wrote.

Bertie Beetle is the name of an Australian chocolate bar made by Nestle. 

The ABC has confirmed they asked Geoff Hutchison, a Perth radio presenter, to remove an offensive Tweet that was posted during the Sydney siege

A statement from the ABC released on Tuesday, confirmed that the company's management had requested Mr Hutchison to delete the tweet 'soon after it was posted'.

The insensitive post Mr Hutchison wrote on Twitter

'The tweet contained the views of the individual and are not endorsed by the ABC,' the statement said.

'He is currently on leave but when contacted by ABC to question the appropriateness of the tweet, Geoff suggested he was commenting on the nature of the media coverage.

'Subsequent to the discussion, Geoff chose to take it down.'

'Geoff has expressed his regret that the tweet may have caused any undue concern or upset.'

The ABC 720 morning host tweeted constantly throughout the siege as more information came through, mostly criticising media coverage of the event and social media users for spreading unconfirmed rumours.

'Breaking News - no new development on #sydneysiege. We go live to the scene. Reporter, what can you tell us? Nothing. More soon,' an earlier tweet from Mr Hutchison read.

The tasteless tweet comes only a few weeks after the ABC was forced to apologise for another controversial tweet regarding the status of cricketer Phillip Hughes, as he was rushed from the Sydney Cricket Ground after just being hit by a bouncer.

It read: 'Cricket NSW could not confirm if Phil Hughes was alive when he left the SCG,' leading to an uproar from social media users at the premature and unclear tweet.

'The tweet was a mistake. It was meant for internal use, but someone mistakenly tweeted the information,' an ABC spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia at the time.

'As soon as we noticed, it was taken down and we posted an apology. We do apologise for the tweet.'

Mr Hutchison is well-known for his controversial social media comments. In 2010, he deleted his entire Twitter account after posting a series of offensive Tweets during an appearance by Tony Abbott on ABC's QandA program.

The above tweet prompted an angry response for failing to mention the siege victims

One of these tweets was: 'Tony, why are you frightened of intercourse with Julia? Is it because we will be watching and measuring?'

However Mr Hutchison was not the only person to be criticised for a tweet during the siege in Sydney, with Rupert Murdoch prompting a flood of angry responses from people for choosing to brag about his newspaper rather than mentioning the victims.

'AUST gets wake-call with Sydney terror. Only Daily Telegraph caught the bloody outcome at 2.00 am. Congrats,' Murdoch's tweet said.
