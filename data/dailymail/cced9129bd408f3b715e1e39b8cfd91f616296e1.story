It looks as though this astronaut may have been edited into an idyllic shot of the British coastline to show how the moon landing footage could have been faked. 

But this mystery spaceman baffled onlookers when he was actually spotted walking along the seafront in Kent.

The lonely figure in a space suit walked along a concrete spit heading out to sea on Margate beach before turning back and walking across the sand.

He was photographed on Sunday morning, walking on the sand near Marine Terrace.

Hayley Mollart, restaurant supervisor at the Sands Hotel at the Kent resort, said staff on the breakfast shift first spotted him. 

She said: 'No one knows why he was there but there were people with cameras with him. It was an unusual sight.' 

For at least 250 years, Margate has been a leading seaside resort in the UK, drawing Londoners to its beaches, Margate Sands.
