Alastair Cook batted on Wednesday as if he didn’t know what all the fuss was about, adding an unbeaten 70 to his first-innings 95 to quieten the debate about the captain’s form. It was just a shame so few people turned up to watch.

A crowd of 4,784 at the Ageas Bowl felt more like a county Twenty20 game than the fourth day of a crucial Test. The sun was out, spectators went topless, and ice creams were sold. It was pleasant enough.

But for a state-of-the-art venue staging only its second Test, and desperate to host an Ashes match in 2019, it was not a good look.

Hampshire deserve sympathy. When they bid for a game in this series, they did not know they would be lumbered with the first Sunday start in England in 135 years.

This oddity is a consequence of a sardine-like schedule, with five Tests crammed into 42 days. For Hampshire the effect, ironically, has been anti-commercial: corporate boxes are unfillable at weekends. And with the rest of this match played on work days, attendances have fallen away.

The county’s chairman Rod Bransgrove, who cut an upbeat figure on Sunday after 15,000 made their way to Southampton - despite problems on the roads and railways - was more subdued on Wednesday, even though the ECB have underwritten potential losses for this game.

‘It’s a massive disappointment, if not totally unexpected,’ he said.

‘We were prepared, because we knew what the ticket sales were going into the match. We did everything humanly possible to market the game, but it is a disappointment to see this sort of crowd at a beautiful sunny ground with a game up for grabs.’

Celebration: England are on the brink of their first Test victory in 11 matches against India in the third Test

Bransgrove was not alone. ‘Shame to see so many empty seats at the Ageas Bowl,’ tweeted former Hampshire star Chris Tremlett. ‘Starting on Sunday is a shame for the club, especially as it’s produced a great Test.’

But there are other factors at play. For all the good work done at the Ageas Bowl over the years, the venue - situated just off the M27 - does not obviously encourage walk-up customers.

Then there’s the surprising lack of Indian fans, a worrying echo of the first Test at Trent Bridge. Former batting star Rahul Dravid suggested: ‘It’s a five-Test series with two games in London and one in Manchester. Perhaps places like The Oval and Old Trafford are easier to get to.’

Dravid was still playing when India last toured England three years ago. Then, crowds flocked to see Sachin Tendulkar. Now, Indian fans either feel less connection to MS Dhoni’s young side, or they’re waiting for the one-dayers.

Nor is it a coincidence that England under Cook have failed to win any of their last 10 Tests. Whatever the reason, English cricket should be concerned that a Test match played in high summer, and without the distraction of football’s Premier League, has attracted so few spectators.

If five-day cricket really is thriving in England, there are times when it has a funny way of showing it.

Location: Despite the great cricket, the Ageas Bowl is situated next to the M27 which stops walk-up customers

The Ageas Bowl hopes to host an Ashes Test in 2019 but this will not help

@highlight

It has not helped that this is the first Test to start on a Sunday in England

The building of a stadium near M27 may also discourage walk-up customers
