Strict policy: The store imposed the the dress code last week claiming scantily clad customers were a potential health and safety risk

A branch of Tesco has banned 'half naked' customers because they are an 'embarrassment' and a 'health and safety risk'.

Scores of scantily-clad women and shirtless men flocked to the store during a recent hot spell - to stock up on alcohol and barbecue supplies.

But other customers were appalled at the beer bellies and bare feet and filed complaints against the supermarket, in Tiverton, Devon.

Bosses at the shop say the amount of flesh on show has left other shoppers 'embarrassed' and have since imposed a strict dress code.

They have also ruled the bare torsos could be a breach of health and safety laws - because the shirtless punters might drip sweat onto fresh produce.

The ban was imposed last week and also bars customers from wandering the superstore in bare feet.

A Tesco spokesman said the latest clampdown followed a string of complaints to managers about scantily-clad shoppers.

He said: 'As we see glimpses of the summer weather, we've decided that it's sensible to ask customers to wear t-shirts and footwear in store.

'We don't want them to tread on anything sharp and we want all of our customers to feel comfortable. Our store managers use their common sense.

Dress code: Customers without shirts and shoes are barred from entering Tiverton's Tesco after complaints from other shoppers

'This kind of decision is made on a 
store-by-store basis and at the manager's discretion as a result of a 
customer raising the issue with the team.

'So it is often in response to issues that have been brought to us and the store has decided in this case to address them.'

Customers have been told of the new rules in a sign posted in the shop's windows.

Belies and bare feet have both been barred from the Tesco branch after the exposed flesh caused others 'embarrassment'

It says: 'To avoid causing offence or embarrassment to others, as well as for health and safety reasons, we ask that customers are appropriately dressed when visiting our stores. Shirts, tops and shoes must be worn at all times.'

Customers visiting the 40,000 square foot superstore and adjacent petrol station today welcomed the ban.

One said: 'I was more concerned about topless and sweaty people leaning over the fresh fruit, salad or bread. It just doesn't bare thinking about.'

Tesco has launched similar clothing crackdowns in the past, previously banning customers from visiting a store in Cardiff in their pyjamas.
