He's the humongous snake who, in the words of his catcher, should sign himself up for Weightwatchers.

A Newcastle animal controller yesterday captured the fattest red belly black snake he had ever seen, after he was discovered lurking under an air conditioning unit at a business park in Cameron Park.

'He needs like, Weightwatchers, or something,' Geoff Delooze told Daily Mail Australia.

'Isn't he monstrous?'

Enormoussssssssssssss! The red-belly black snake typically feasts on frogs, mice - and other snakes.

It took Mr Delooze ten minutes to coax the venomous snake out from its adopted home at the WDS Engineering building.

The snake weighed slightly less than 10kg and was around two metres long. 

It's rare for the serpents to grow this long and the snake catcher has never seen one of that weight.

'I've got pythons here and he's bigger than them,' said Mr Delooze, a senior reptile technician at Newcastle and Hunter Animal Control. 

Even a bird of prey would struggle with a reptile of this size, Mr Delooze said. 

He said the red belly would have feasted on frogs, mice, and no doubt, other snakes too. 

'A hundred per cent (sure),' he said. 'They're cannibalistic, they'll eat whatever they can fit in their mouth.' 

Mothers often hunt down their own babies after they hatch. 

Snake sightings typically increase in the warmer months. And there is evidence the 'season' is slithering off to a speedy start.

Ssssssssssssssssurprise! This snake burst from a bathroom fitting in Brisbane. 

'Omg. That's not even funny': One of many remarks made by startled Facebook users after Snake Catchers Brisbane posted these pictures. 

A Queensland snake catching company posted these dramatic pictures of a carpet python bursting out of a bathroom light fitting earlier this week. 

It provoked a frightful response on their Facebook page. 

'You'd wanna hope there's a toilet in that bathroom after walking in to see that - it'd be needed LOL,' Nikki Day said. 

'Omg. That's not even funny. Our heat light is like that,' another user, Shara Feneck, said.
