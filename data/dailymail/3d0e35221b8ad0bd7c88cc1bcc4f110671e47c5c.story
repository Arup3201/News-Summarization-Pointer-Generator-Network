A church which had lead stolen from its roof has been refused an insurance payout – because it had scaffolding up.

Holy Trinity’s insurer says it is not covered as the poles ‘helped’ the thieves.

Burglars climbed the scaffolding, erected for a £220,000 restoration project, before stealing lead from a lightning conductor and a hatch at the top of its 100ft tower.

The vicar of the church in Hartlepool believed the building was covered during the repair work as he had paid an extra £800 on top of its annual £1,500 premium.

But insurer Ecclesiastical says the policy contains a ‘standard’ clause stating it will not cover thefts while scaffolding is in use.

Church members have to foot the £2,000 to £3,000 replacement bill themselves.

The vicar, Father Paul Allinson, said: ‘It does seem rather odd and unfair and makes us wonder why we were actually paying for the extra cover. Maybe it is something people need to be aware of.’

The Association of British Insurers said most home insurance policies have no specific caveat regarding scaffolding. But if it was found a scaffold had aided thieves, a policy could be invalidated because of the owner’s lack of ‘due care or attention’.

A spokesman for Ecclesiastical said the church knew theft was not covered while scaffolding was up. She added: ‘It is a standard exclusion applied by Ecclesiastical on all church policies.’
