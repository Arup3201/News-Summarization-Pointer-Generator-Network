David Moyes enjoyed a crisp as Real Sociedad crashed out of the Copa del Rey following a 2-2 home draw against Villarreal.

Moyes, unhappy that a number of decisions had gone against his team, argued with referee Carlos Carballo Velasco with nine minutes to go and was ordered to the stands after gesturing that the official needed glasses.

The former Manchester United manager then took a seat high in the stands at the Anoeta and smiled as he accepted the offer of the snack from one of the home supporters.

Moyes helped himself to what looked to be a salted snack, but declined the offer of some peanuts from another Sociedad fan.

The team with Canary-yellow shirts, who played the last 10 minutes with 10 men following the dismissal of defender Mateo Musacchio, will play Getafe for a place in the last four after the Madrid club beat Almeria 1-0 at home to advance 2-1 on aggregate. 

Villarreal striker Gerard Moreno doubled the visitor's aggregate advantage with a delightful curling effort into the bottom corner after a driving run from ex-Tottenham winger Giovani dos Santos to give his side a 1-0 lead on the night.

Former Arsenal midfielder Carlos Vela gave hope to Moyes' side with a poacher's finish from a Sociedad corner moments before half-time.

Vela found the net after Villarreal goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo managed to keep out an Inigo Martinez header but could only palm the ball into the Sociedad striker's path.

Dos Santos looked to have settled the tie when the Mexican forward found the net after bundling his way into the Sociedad box and sliding the ball past the onrushing goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli.

Moyes' side weren't finished yet, though, as Esteban Granero fired the home side level once again with a stunning left-footed volley, but it was too little too late as tempers began to flare in Spain.

Speaking after the game Moyes said the referee had been wrong on both occasions and criticised Spanish officials for showing too many yellow cards.

'This is a Cup tie, it's a big game, but I think the referee just took the speed from the game,' he told a news conference.

'I think people want to come to see action and the two decisions I was yellow-carded for were incorrect,' added the 51-year-old.
