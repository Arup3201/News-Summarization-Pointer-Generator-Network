A Roma pickpocketing ring which trafficked hundreds of children across Europe threatening them with severe beatings if they did not go out to steal has been smashed, French police claim.

More than 200 children, some as young a 12, would allegedly be given targets of stealing up to £250 a day before being dropped off in central Paris or other cities and ordered to target tourists.

According to the police some of the children involved had been arrested, cautioned and released hundreds of times but were simply sent back out to steal.

rob and steal

The suspected masterminds are a married 
Romanian couple named as Stejar B, 43 and Lucica T, 44, who are also 
accused of exploiting four of their own children, aged from 13 to 17, as part of the operation.

The pair, along with four other Romanians have been charged with people trafficking, forcing minors to commit crimes, money laundering and criminal conspiracy, the Times newspaper reported.

Officers said the children were being 'trafficked for criminal purposes' to other countries, describing it as the biggest family-based network exploiting Eastern European youths they had ever discovered.

Romanian police liaison officers, 
sent to France to help tackle the problem of Roma gangs, are understood 
to have assisted in the arrests.

In
2012 French police arrested 1,769 minors for pickpocketing or 
distraction theft, but even if caught they are released within a few 
hours.

‘There’s very little we can do with them,’ admitted a 
Paris police source. ‘As children, they effectively have absolute 
immunity from prosecution.

'Much of the money they make ends up with the adult gangmasters who run them. They are much harder to catch because they hide away in the shadows.’

Two years ago, France’s then Interior Minister Claude Gueant said the vast majority of street robberies in Paris were being carried out by the children of Roma immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria.

A Romanian police taskforce is also helping the Metropolitan police in dealing with Roma in London.

There are fears that thousands more Roma will head for Britain when the benefits and employment restrictions are lifted in January.
