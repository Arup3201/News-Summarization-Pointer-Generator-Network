John Terry claims referees have an agenda against Chelsea after they Phil Dowd refused to award another penalty in their 5-3 defeat at Tottenham.

The Chelsea skipper believes match officials are being influenced by managers and coaches criticising Jose Mourinho’s players for diving in recent weeks.

Chelsea players have been cautioned four times this season for simulation and Mourinho is convinced a campaign has been started against the Barclays Premier League leaders.

Terry said: ‘A little bit. There has been a lot of highlights on the box and in the papers as well, which is unfair.

‘I think the refs have to come into the games with a clear mind and judge each game as it is.

‘You can’t go into a game thinking ‘someone did this, someone did that’.

‘There are reputations out there, but the referees have got to come into it with a clear mind and I think the last two games we have been denied two clear penalties.’

Chelsea are still top, despite a difficult Christmas period following a draw at Southampton and an unexpected defeat at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day.

Despite Chelsea’s second defeat of the season in the Premier League, Terry is convinced they will still go on to win the title at the end of the season.

Terry added: ‘Listen, at the moment we are top of the League and we are there for a reason because we are playing some great stuff and we’ve seen us outplay a lot of side this year.

‘So at half-time we were confident we could comeback in the game. They then made it 4-1, it was then uphill from there, which is difficult. But we kept fighting and we’ll kick on and wipe this one away.

‘We soaked up a bit of play, they had some early good play. Once we got the goal, they are on the back foot and got a goal from nothing and they are back in the game.

‘We could have maybe got a pen to go two up, didn’t get it, but as I said we are disappointed with the loss, that’s clear to see from everyone’s faces and the fans as well.

‘We’ll regroup and we’ll go again, we’re playing some really good stuff as well.’

Chelsea will continue to assess goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois after he damaged fingers on his right hand during the defeat at Tottenham.
