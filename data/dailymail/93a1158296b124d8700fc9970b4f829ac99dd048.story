A mother’s role in life is to make sure her children are ready to take on the world when they leave the nest, and the same rules apply in the animal kingdom.

This brown bear and her three cubs were spotted having a climbing lesson by a pond at a nature reserve in Finland.

After showing the little ones how it’s done, the Eurasian brown bear’s three cubs made their way up the pine tree.

The bravest even climbed all the way 
to the top, and perched on one of the branches while its siblings stayed
 firmly on the ground with Mama Bear.

The
 family bonding time was captured by Lithuanian photographers Dalia 
Kvedaraite, 35, and Giedrius Stakauskas, 38, on a visit to the 
Martinselkonen Nature Reserve, located close to the Russian border.

‘A
 female bear arrived at this spot with her cubs when several powerful 
male bears had moved away from the area,’ explains Ms Kvedaraite.

‘There was plenty of action from the fluffy bear cubs as they were playing and digging up vegetation all evening.

‘Their mum was teaching them how to climb and they all followed her lead as they scurried up the tree one by one.

‘All the cubs were so cute and funny, but the smallest one was particularly playful and so adorable.’

Only a few feet away from the bears, the photographers were able to watch them play together for hours.

Dalia
 says: ‘Unfortunately, later that evening, this little family of bears 
was frightened by a huge and very aggressive male bear.

‘This forced not only the cubs but even the female to climb up to the top of the 33ft tree.

‘They certainly put their climbing skills to good use, and they reached the top in a mere five to ten seconds.’

Adult
 male Eurasian brown bears weigh between 550-660lbs and can reach around
 two meters in length, whereas a cub's average height is just 2ft5in.

‘Usually, cubs only climb the trees when they see adult male approaching, as they are afraid,’ Ms Kvedaraite said.

‘If
 a male bear appears too aggressive, the mother bear sometimes has no 
other option than to climb a tree - in order to get out of his way.

‘It was an amazing and unbelievable experience.

‘The excitement from such an encounter like this kept us awake all night.’
