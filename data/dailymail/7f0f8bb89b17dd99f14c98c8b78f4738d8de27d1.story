Even if you have parental controls set up on your computer, your children might still be at risk from porn and other adult content, an investigation has revealed.

Extensive tests, carried out by technology magazine PC Pro, have revealed that only three of the 15 most popular web filtering services - both free and paid-for - actually blocked 100 per cent of porn sites the testers tried to visit.

This means 80 per cent of packages are leaving children potentially at risk of viewing adult material while they browse the web.

PC Pro tested 15 of the most popular web filters to discover only three blocked 100% of porn. It also tested each filter using pro-anorexia, pro-suicide, gore and gambling sites, as well as sites classed containing 'hate' or 'tasteless humour'

There are two basic ways of protecting children from inappropriate online content.

Network-level filters block sites before they reach your browser meaning every device used to visit that site will block it.

'Client-based controls' should be installed on every PC, but can 
provide additional protection beyond web filtering. 

According to PC Pro, software-based 
systems are more flexible because a user can set restrictions 
for different family members.

Users can also create bespoke black and whitelists of which links to block.

This means that even if a site isn't considered to contain adult content, if a user doesn't want their child visiting it, they can block it automatically.

Some software-based packages also included time-limiting features, too, while others can restrict games 
and videos based on age ratings.

As well as sites considered to be pornographic, PC Pro additionally tested each filter against sites classified as containing gore, gambling, pro-anorexia and pro-suicide, hate and tasteless humour.

More than 150 sites were tested, yet not a single package blocked every instance of explicit, adult or inappropriate content.

Norton Family was the best performing package of the lot and was the PC Pro Labs Winner.

PC Pro also recommended Blue Coat's K9 Web Protection kit.

The worst performing sites in tests were MetaCert and OpenDNS Basic.

They blocked a total of 88 per cent and 60 per cent of porn sites respectively - all other sites scored above 90 per cent.

MetaCert failed to block a single gambling, gore, pro-anorexia or hate site.

AVG Family Safety and Windows Live Family Safety also didn't block any gambling sites.

In tests, each product’s percentage score represents the proportion of sites of each type it blocked.

In all but the false-positives category, a higher score indicated better protection. False-positives are when a service believes a site is inappropriate when it isn't and blocks it anyway.

Net Nanny fared slightly better against offensive sites than the winner Norton Family, but its very high false-positive rate knocked it down the table.

At the bottom of the rankings, OpenDNS and MetaCert delivered 'flawless performance' in the false-positives test, but were branded 'useless overall' by the testers because of 'their repeated failures to block non-family-friendly sites.'

PC Pro's Technical Editor Darien Graham-Smith said: 'The results of this month’s web-filter tests aren’t exactly reassuring. Time and again we saw graphic pornography sail through supposedly strict filters, while harmless news and reference pages were blocked.

'Such failures shouldn’t be a surprise. No doubt some human intelligence feeds into the filtering process, but with more than 600 million websites in existence, and an estimated 100,000 new onesspringing up every day, it simply isn’t possible to inspect every site manually.'

PC Pro set up each product or service on a clean Windows 8 laptop before setting the strictest filtering rules on each, that didn't rely purely on whitelisting.

This meant they could identify any holes in each package’s filtering system.

They then attempted to visit 145 websites that were deemed inappropriate and shouldn't be accessible to young children.

This included 74 pornography sites or image searches, plus a selection of sites promoting gambling, 'gore', suicide, anorexia, 'hate' and tasteless humour, as well as web proxies.

Proxy services can be used to reveal the contents of blocked sites. 

The full list of sites is available from PC Pro's website.

They also tried to visit 18 sites that shouldn’t be blocked, including support pages for physical and mental health issues, teen magazines and other inoffensive sites such as the BBC homepage.

If one of these was blocked, it was considered a 'false-positive'.

The total number of objectionable pages allowed through the filter, minus any false positives, determined the Filtering score PC Pro awarded to each package.

They also awarded a Features score, representing the range and usefulness of features on offer; plus scores for Ease of Use and Value for Money.

The overall score was an average of these, weighted towards filtering performance.

He continued that it’s important to approach web filtering as only one aspect of a home internet strategy and that parents should also communicate with their children and warn them how to handle inappropriate content if they find it.

'It’s a good idea to have this conversation even if you do enforce a whitelist: kids are inquisitive, and while they may not run into transgressive material at home, they will experience it through friends and via personal mobile devices.'

The PC Pro tests concentrated on PC-based filters but web filters can also be added to mobile devices.
