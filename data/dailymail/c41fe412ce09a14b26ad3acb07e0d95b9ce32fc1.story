Julia Louis-Dreyfus worked an e-cigarette into a skit at the Golden Globes and now a group of senators have criticized the move because they thought it glamorized the cigarette substitute.

The former Seinfeld star wasn't the only one using the electronic cigarettes to get her nicotine fix during the live show, as Leonardo DiCaprio was also seen smoking an e-cigarette when the camera randomly panned to him.

Four senators have written a formal letter of complaint to the award show's producers saying that by allowing stars to be seen puffing on the electronic devices, they were effectively advertising the products with star wattage attached.

There she glows: Julia Louis Dreyfus also puffed on the device as she took part in a skit where she was trying to act 'too cool' but now politicians have slammed the move as a form of glamorizing e-cigarettess

Looks like the real deal: The star was seen exhaling steam as Reese Witherspoon giggled alongside her 

'In light of studies showing that 
exposure to on-screen smoking is a major contributor to smoking 
initiation among youth, we are troubled that these images glamorize 
smoking and serve as celebrity endorsements that could encourage young 
fans to begin smoking traditional cigarettes or e-cigarettes,' the 
letter reads, according to NBC News.

The
 letter was co-signed by four Democratic senators- Dick Durbin from 
Illinois, Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, Ed Markey from 
Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown from Ohio.

It
 was directed to both the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group
 behind the Golden Globe awards, and NBC Universal which produces and 
televises the show.

Neither group has yet to comment on the letter.

Holy
 smokes! Leonardo DiCaprio was one of the stars who was seen puffing on 
an electronic cigarette during an unplanned moment in Sunday Night's Golden Globes ceremony in 
LA

The
 airtime for e-cigarettes also prompted Dr Manny Alvarez to write an 
op-ed for Fox News slamming the move, which he says is particularly 
harmful for women.

'I know 
Hollywood stars always want to promote healthy lifestyles and different 
â€œhealthâ€
