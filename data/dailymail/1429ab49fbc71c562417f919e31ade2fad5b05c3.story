Mr Miliband tried to impress EastEnders' star Dyer with his knowledge of obscure facts about EastEnders at the Attitude awards this week

Some opinion polls have suggested as many as four in 10 people think Mr Miliband is 'weird' or very 'weird'.

After the Tories inched ahead in the polls last week, Labour MPs urged him to 'get out of his north London comfort zone'.

So the Attitude magazine awards in London this week were a chance to shake-off his wonkish image and rub shoulders with stars of stage and screen.

But an encounter with Dyer, who plays Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter, appears to have only reinforced the impression of a leader who is a bit of a geek.

The pair had been introduced the shows' producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins. An onlooker told The Sun: 'He immediately made a big point of saying he knew a lot about the show.

'Then he started saying how the character of Martin Fowler has had three different actors playing him and how Ben Mitchell's character has had five. 

Singer Boy George also met Mr Miliband a tweeted this selfie, declaring that the Labour leader was 'not creepy in any way'

Dyer plays Mick Carter, landlord of the Queen Vic, in the BBC One soap, but Mr Miliband admitted he does not watch it

'Danny was a bit confused so asked him if watches the show. Ed shook his head and said, "No, I don't have time any more but I've been doing a lot of research about it online".'

Since 1996 Ben Mitchell, son of veteran hardman Phil, has been played by Matthew Silver, Morgan Whittle, Charlie Jones, Joshua Pascoe and most recently Harry Reid, who joined the show this year.

Similarly, Martin Fowler has been played by Jon Peyton Price and James Alexandrou, with James Bye taking over this year.

In a minor boost for Mr Miliband, 1980s singer Boy George posed for a selfie with the Labour leader and later tweeted: 'Ed Milliband, totally cool, no attitude, not creepy in any way. Very genuine and the nicest politician I have met. Period!'

However, Dyer remain unimpressed, telling the newspaper: 'It was all a bit too heavy for me. I had to sit the f*** down.'

Labour insiders today stressed the Mr Miliband liked to stay on top of popular culture.
