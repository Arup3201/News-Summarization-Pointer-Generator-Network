Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere appears to have mastered Cristiano Ronaldo's famous stance during his lengthy spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury.

Wilshere, who has been out of action since Arsenal's 2-1 defeat against Manchester United on November 22, struck a similar pose to the Real Madrid star during Monday's training session.

Ronaldo usually stands with his feet wide apart while tensing his upper body before taking free-kicks in order to psych himself up during a match.

Wilshere has been out of action since sustaining an ankle injury against Manchester United in November 

Wilshere will be desperate to return to Arsene Wenger's first team plans in the near future after being ruled out for three months.

Arsene Wenger, speaking before his side's Barclays Premier League match against Leicester, said he did not know when the England international would be available for selection.

'We have to monitor him daily,' said Wenger. 'I don't know when he'll return.'

Meanwhile, Wilshere's Arsenal and England team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is facing a further two weeks on the treatment table after sustaining a groin injury against Manchester City in January.
