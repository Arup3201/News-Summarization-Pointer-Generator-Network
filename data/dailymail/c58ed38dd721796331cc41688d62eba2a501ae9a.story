One brave Australian woman has decided to share rare and terrifying insight into her abusive relationship.

A video diary, documented by victim Elisha Gercovich, has been released to bring the issue of domestic abuse to the forefront.

But the story doesn't end here for the mother of two, who is still currently on the run from her aggressive ex-partner Carlo Corsa.

Elisha Gercovich released videos of her ex-partner Carlo Corsa breaking into her house, verbally abusing her and also images of her bruised face  

The daughter of a policeman told A Current Affair that she 'had to become smarter to survive'.

'I was terrified. I had to be smarter than my perpetrator,' she said.

Although Carlo pleaded guilty to numerous charges of assault, the magistrate released him after 64 days of being in remand.

Now the brave mother is living out of boxes and was forced to move seven times in 21 days since she left her home in Melbourne west.

She recounted the terrifying and heartbreaking moment when the physical abuse began.

'He punched me,' she said. 'All and everything I had hoped and dreamt for in this person was gone in that one punch.'

The ex-partner was filmed wielding a large kitchen knife in front of the mother of two

One particularly chilling video shows Carlo wielding a large kitchen knife close to Elisha, seemingly unfazed that she was filming him.

In another instance, the mother filmed herself locked inside a room while Corsa threatened her and tried to smash his way through the door.

'Open the f**ing door up now,' he yelled.

Although it was 'love at first sight' at the beginning of the relationship, Elisa said she soon began to see signs of Corsa's true personality.

'I noticed that medications were taken, medications that I needed and required, hidden. Property was taken, my jewellery, wallet. My credit cards were snapped - that was a means of control,' she said.

The abuse then began and Elisa even claims she was thrown out of his moving car.

Unfortunately, Elisha's story isn't an isolated case in Australia.

One in three women experienced physical violence since the age of 15, according to an Australian Bureau of Statistic survey in 2005, while another study shows one woman is killed every week as a result of domestic violence.

Elisha hopes other women will speak out against domestic violence just as she did.

'Get up, get out and go speak up,' she said.

'It's better than being dead.'
