A pilot has blamed one of his passengers for coughing 'incessantly' into his headset during a short flight in the Northern Territory which caused him to forget to put the landing gear down, an air crash report has found.

The Australian Air Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) released its report on Wednesday into the 'wheels up landing' on December 12, 2014 at Jabiru Airport, southeast of Darwin. 

The unidentified pilot was flying a six-seat Cessna 310 aircraft, registered VH-TBE, with two adults and three children on board when he became distracted by one of the passengers.

The pilot also reported that the children on board were 'excited and a little disruptive' during the flight.

Despite this, the report also found the pilot was 'relatively new to the C-310' and unfamiliar with the plane equipment.

'The pilot of a Cessna 310 aircraft  was completing a charter flight from Oenpelli to Jabiru, Northern Territory,' the ATSB report read.

'During the short flight, one of the passengers coughed incessantly through the headset which distracted the pilot. Once he had the aircraft stable he reached over and unplugged the headset.'

The pilot was further told the ATSB that the three children on board were 'excited and a little disruptive, and he had kept a close watch on their activities'.

He then reported to have commenced his pre-landing checks and verbalised 'undercarriage down', but made a decision to 'leave this particular action until later on final approach'.

When he became aware of that the undercarriage remained retracted when the aircraft touched down, he landed the plane on the runway centreline and heard the propellers contacting the ground.

He then steered the aircraft slightly to the left of the runway as he was mindful of another aircraft in the circuit behind him.

'This incident highlights the impact a combination of distractions can have on aircraft operations,' the ATSB report concluded. 

However the report also found the pilot was 'relatively new to the C-310'.

'In hindsight, he felt it would have been beneficial to have been familiarised with all the annunciators on TBE prior to flying the aircraft,' the report read.

There were no injuries to either the pilot or passengers but the aircraft was 'substantially damaged'.

A spokesman for the ATSB was unable to reveal the name of the pilot and the company involved.

'While details of the pilot and charter company are not secret it is not the remit of the ATSB to divulge that information,' the spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.
