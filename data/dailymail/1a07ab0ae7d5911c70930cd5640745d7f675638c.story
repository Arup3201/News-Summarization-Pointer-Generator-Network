A bizarre green 'fireball' left residents in Colorado baffled after appearing in the sky for more than ten seconds.

The bright light, which was seen by dozens of early morning commuters on Wednesday, lingered over a highway before disappearing behind mountains.

Residents took to social media to share their theories, which ranged from an unusually bright aircraft to an alien invasion.

Erica Hopkins wrote on Twitter: 'Ummmmmm the green fireball in Colorado sky this morning...what DE heck was that and why nobody seem to care?' (sic)

And Greg Moore, an analyst and contributor at Weather5280, said: 'Huge fireball north to south west of vail pass this morning. Bright green flaming tail. Across full sky. #fireball #meteor #cowx'

But NASA has now confirmed the unusual sight was just a meteor. 

Bill Cooke, lead for the meteoroid environments office at NASA, said that the meteor moved from east to west around 45,000 miles per hour.

Residents took to social media to discuss what they had seen and share their theories, which ranged from an unusually bright aircraft to an alien invasion

'The fireball belongs to a class of meteors called Earthgrazers, which hit the Earth's atmosphere at a very shallow angle,' he told the Denver Post. 

Earthgrazers are bright stars that often display colourful halos and long-lasting trails.  

The American Meteor Society wrote on Facebook that 150 witnesses had filed sightings spanning from southern Wyoming and northern Colorado. 

It added on its website: 'This is an atypical meteor event because most fireball meteors last only three to five seconds.'

It said it did not know whether it was a fireball meteor or space trash.
