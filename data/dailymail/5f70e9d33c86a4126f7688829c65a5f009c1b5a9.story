Writer Mark Palmer was cynical when he joined a speed awareness course - but emerged a convert

'And I hope we never get to meet again,’ says John, as he puts the top back on his red marker pen and prepares to leave the room. There’s an uneasy silence.

We get what he means, but most of us would be only too pleased to see him again, albeit in different circumstances.

We’ve been in his company for the past four hours because we’ve strayed from the rules of the Highway Code, and now we want to thank this shirt-sleeved saviour who has shepherded us back to the path of motoring righteousness.

‘That was absolutely fascinating, John, and sobering, too,’ I tell him as we shake hands by the vending machine.

Certainly, my attitude is light years from how it was at 12.15pm when I walked into a dreary office building on London’s dreary Uxbridge Road on a dreary Tuesday.

There were 24 of us gathered as our names were ticked off by a woman carrying a clipboard and a knowing expression.

We had paid £97 each to attend one of the AA’s Speed Awareness Courses, a relatively small sum compared with the prospects of an ‘SP20’ endorsement and three points on our licence. In my case that would have meant a tally of 12 and six months or so on the buses.

All my points have been for speeding. On this occasion I had been doing 38mph in a 30mph limit, hardly criminal I told myself, as we shuffled into the room.

Then, to my horror, I found myself sitting slap bang in the middle of the front row.

At the very least, my idea had been to spend the afternoon doodling at the back of the class or writing my Christmas card list.

I glanced at my fellow naughty speeders.

Some attendees on the course, led by a tutor named John, did not know the national speed limit of 60mph

We were a cosmopolitan bunch of all ages. One woman arrived with her weekly Sainsbury’s shop.

The man across the aisle from me was wearing a thick coat and bobble hat which he kept on throughout the session despite it being an overheated room.

Some of us had taken our driving tests only a few years ago; others, like me, have been behind the wheel four decades or more, during which the rules of the road have changed somewhat —  as I was about to discover.

‘My name’s John and I am not a policeman,’ he began. ‘Now let’s face it, you don’t really want to be here but let’s all try to get on and, who knows, you might find some of it interesting.’

Shortly after the off, he asked us to jot down the speed limits for urban areas, rural single carriageways, dual carriageways and motorways.

I was sure the country roads limit was 70mph. I always understood the round white signs with a black diagonal line through them that you see on leaving a village mean you can go pretty much as fast as you like.

More than half of the 1,754 people who died on the roads last year were driving on rural roads

The correct answer was 60mph. Hardly anyone scored top marks.

‘Perhaps we should re-read the Highway Code from time to time,’ said John. ‘Just a thought.’

John was never patronising or judgmental, always polite and good-humoured.

He told us that if a pedestrian is hit at 20mph the survival rate is almost 98 per cent, whereas if they are hit at 40mph the chances of survival drop to just 10 per cent.

Writer Mark Palmer: 'I no longer think of speed cameras as cash dispensers for local authorities'

He then ventured that if he were Transport Secretary he would be keen for all drivers to attend a speed awareness course every ten years or so as a ‘refresher’.

‘I’d vote for you,’ said a woman by the window.

‘Me, too,’ said a self-confessed White Van Man.

I would go further. Learner drivers should have to attend one of these classes before taking their tests, and fines for speeding should be far higher than for a parking ticket.

There is no excuse for speeding, just as there is no excuse for texting at the wheel.

Oh yes, I’m filled with the zeal and intolerance of the newly converted. I have been a speedy driver most of my life — but not because I get a thrill from it.

I speed because I am impatient and am often running late.

I speed because my main thoughts when driving are about myself rather than the safety of anyone else. John hasn’t just cut my speed, he’s also increased my awareness of others.

Yesterday, as my wife entered a 40mph zone in Norfolk, I suggested she should drive in either second or third gear so that the noise of the engine would remind her of the limit — a tip John had passed on.

And, then, when she was preparing to turn right off a single lane across traffic I said she should not turn the wheels until she knew it was safe to make the manoeuvre. As John had pointed out, ‘if you do and someone shunts you from behind then you’ll end up being pushed into the oncoming traffic’.

Last year, 1,754 people died on the roads, the lowest figure since records began in 1926.

Sixty per cent of those died in accidents on rural roads, 34 per cent in towns and villages and only 6 per cent on motorways. 

With the help of Powerpoint slides, still photography and live footage of cars braking at various speeds, John was winning over his audience.

Toot-toot! Mark Palmer was more like Mr Toad from Wind in the Willows, played here by Matt Lucas

He didn’t go out of his way to shock — although there was an audible gasp when he showed a crushed child’s bike under the wheel of a car following an accident in Finchley, North London.

‘What happened to the child?’ asked a woman near the back.

‘She died, I’m afraid.’

‘Oh...’ said the woman, her voice breaking. ‘I have a young daughter and I’m finding this uncomfortable. Can we move on?’

There were several more gasps when we saw a detailed reconstruction of the worst motorway crash ever in Britain.

It involved 51 vehicles on the eastbound carriageway of the M4 near junction 14 in March 1991. No one was speeding, but several cars were going far too fast in the dense fog.

Ten died and more than 25 were injured. Such was the carnage that the M4 was closed for four days while the wreckage was removed and the road repaved.

What has amazed me since last week is how I no longer see speed cameras as the enemy. And I no longer think of them as cash dispensers for local authorities trying to balance the books.

‘How many speed cameras are there in London within the M25?’ John had asked us.

‘About 5,000,’ I said.

‘No, more than that,’ said the Sainsbury’s shopper.

‘The answer is 692, actually, and only about a quarter of those will be active at any one time,’ said John, who went on to explain the strict criteria that allows a camera to be installed in the first place.

Top of the list is that three people need to have been killed or seriously injured within half a mile of the allotted stretch of road in a 36-month period.

In addition, 20 per cent of vehicles have to be travelling at above the speed limit for 28 consecutive days.

Some crashes, such as this one on the Sheppey Crossing in Kent in September, are caused by drivers not paying enough attention to weather conditions such as fog. Another such crash on the M4 in 1991 killed 10

What this means is that a speed camera immediately tells you there has been a history of accidents, possibly some fatal.

You can rail against them all you want, but you’ll never feel the pain as much as the mother or father, wife or husband of those who have died as a result of someone going too fast.

Frankly, it appalls me that my son, who passed his test last month and who has inherited the impatience of his father, is driving around without attending one of these courses.

And it’s ludicrous that new drivers can pass their tests without ever driving on a motorway.

This week, the Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said that driving tests should have a distinction grade — rather than just a pass or a fail — to improve road safety because insurers would offer cheaper premiums to those who pass with flying colours.

This seems to me an excellent idea. I also welcome the news that the Government is considering raising the driving age to 18 from 17.

Just as drink driving and the whole notion of ‘one for the road’ is now regarded as indefensible, so, too, speeding should be seen as beyond the pale in a civilised society. Just a thought, as John would say.
