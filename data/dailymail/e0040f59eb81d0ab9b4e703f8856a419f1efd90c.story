Half of Britain's richest hedge-fund millionaires have given cash to the Conservative Party, new figures have revealed.

Of the 59 wealthiest City managers, 27 have ploughed £19million into the Tories' election war-chest - with £10million flowing into the party's coffers since 2010 alone.

The revelations come after  Ed Miliband yesterday repeatedly challenged the Prime Minister over the Conservative Party's links to the City.

The Labour leader accused Mr Cameron of failing to close tax loopholes because he was 'bankrolled by hedge funds'.

He drew attention to the government's decision in 2013 to abolish a little known tax on investment funds, which Labour has described as a £145m 'hedge fund tax cut'.

The Labour leader claimed: 'This is a Prime Minister who won't tackle tax avoidance for the simple reason that too many of his friends would get caught in the net.

'They are the party of Mayfair hedge funds and Monaco tax avoiders and under him you will always know it's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everyone else.' 

The wealthiest hedge fund manager last year, according to The Sunday Times, was Alan Howard, 50, of the Brevan Howard fund, with an estimated personal net worth of £1.6billion.

Mr Howard has contributed £116,000 to the Tory party.

But the two biggest hedge funds donors were Michael Farmer of RK Capital Management, a metals trader, who has donated £6.5million to the Tories and Sir Michael Hintze of Europe's biggest hedge fund, CQS, who has given £3.2m.

Other significant hedge fund donors were Lord Fink, the party's former co-treasurer, who has donated £3.2million to the Tory party and the secretive Chris Rokos, also of Brevan Howard, who has donated £1.3million.

Lucy Powell, vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign, accused the Prime Minister of 'debasing political debate' by refusing to answer questions over his hedge fund backers.

She told the Independent: 'The Tories are standing up for those at the top rather than hardworking families, and David Cameron doesn't want to admit it.'

The Conservatives later claimed that closing the stamp duty loophole would hurt pension funds, rather than penalise hedge funds. 

Mr Cameron accused the Labour Party of failing to act on tax avoidance during its 13 years in office.

He told Mr Miliband: 'When we came to office foreigners didn't pay stamp duty on the properties they bought. Foreigners didn't pay capital gains tax on the properties they bought.

'And because of your tax rates City hedge fund managers were paying lower tax rates than the people who cleaned their offices. That's what we had to sort out.'

The row over accepting money from wealthy donors comes after the Archbishop of Canterbury hit out at tax dodging companies looking to increase profits by not paying their fair share.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said companies and people should pay their 'fair share' in the country where they had made their money, but part of the problem was an 'unbelievably complex' tax system.

The remarks will be seen as a highly political intervention after Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband clashed in the Commons over tax avoidance.

Dr Welby, a former oil executive, said business was important and should be supported but there was a temptation to misuse the power that came through wealth.

He told the BBC: 'There has always been the principle that you pay tax where you earn the money. If you earn money in a particular country, the revenue service of that country needs to get a fair share of what you have earned.'

Highlighting the complexities of the international tax system, he said: 'Someone said the other day that the tax system was of biblical proportions. Well, the Bible's only a thousand pages - how many tax systems are only a thousand pages? They are several hundred times that.

'There needs to be simplification in tax so that people are responsible in the right place.'

He added that there was a 'very basic principle' that 'as a Christian we see that Jesus Christ spoke of, about the importance of people paying what is due'.

'The Bible speaks of it endlessly,' he said.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said companies and people should pay their 'fair share' in the country where they had made their money

It is the Archbishop's latest intervention on economic matters, having spoken out about inequality in recent weeks.

He stressed that 'business is important', adding: 'We need to affirm the significance of those who generate and create wealth, but we also need to be realistic about the fact ... that with wealth comes power and with power comes a temptation to misuse power.

'There's a reality of the human condition, of what Christians call sin, what the Bible calls sin, which says don't misuse the power you have got through wealth.'

Asked whether some people were doing that he said: 'There's always elements where that happens, because people are people.'

But the response to that was not to 'throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that business is bad' - instead, 'solidarity' and an improved regulatory framework were required.
