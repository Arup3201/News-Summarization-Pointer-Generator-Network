Plastic surgeon Erik Scholten has been allowed back to work despite photographing a woman's genitals as he was about to perform surgery on her breast implants

A top plastic surgeon suspended for photographing a patient's genitals on his iPhone to add to his ‘portfolio of female genitalia’ has been allowed back to work.

Dr Erik Scholten was about to replace a woman's breast implants at the private Fitzwilliam Hospital in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, when he took the photo without her consent, a court heard.

The consultant, the UK’s leading specialist for female genital cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, was suspended for 18 months by the General Medical Council last April, pending investigation.

But the GMC has now lifted the ban on practising and allowed Dr Scholten back to the operating theatre on tight conditions, including that he works with a chaperone.

Dr Scholten, who has carried out more than 2,000 cosmetic surgical prodedures, applied to the High Court to have his suspension lifted, calling it ‘disproportionate’.

Ruling on the case, Mr Justice Supperstone said Dr Scholten was about to operate on a woman in February last year when her genitals caught his eye through her surgical underpants.

‘He commented on this anatomical feature to the staff present in the theatre and stated that he intended to photograph it,’ the judge added.

‘He took a single photograph of the patient's genitals, with the surgical underpants pulled aside and her legs in a natural position, together. He used the camera on his iPhone.

‘He did not have the patient's prior consent to take the photograph.’

A ward matron found out about the 
photo and confronted Dr Scholten, who apologised and wrote to the 
patient, insisting he took the picture with the best intentions 
regarding her ‘care pathway’.

Dr
 Scholten said his interest was professional, adding: ‘I am always 
adding to my portfolio of different female genitalia to show prospective
 patients and I was hoping, with your consent, to do so with yours.

'I am always adding to my portfolio of different female genitalia to show prospective patients and I was hoping, with your consent, to do so with yours. I would have discussed this with you and, of course, had you objected, I would have disposed of the imagery immediately'

‘I would have discussed this with you and, of course, had you objected, I would have disposed of the imagery immediately.’

The hospital suspended Dr Scholten from practising there last March, finding he ‘acted inappropriately’, was in breach of good medical practice in failing to respect the patient's dignity and that his actions had the potential to bring the hospital into disrepute.

Dr Scholten was suspended for 18 months by the GMC but, at the High Court, his lawyer, Clodagh Bradley, argued the incident was isolated and there was no evidence of any risk of harm to patients.

Mr Justice Supperstone accepted the panel had failed to properly hold the balance between patients' rights and the devastating impact of the suspension on Dr Scholten and, in the light of that ruling, the GMC has now allowed him back to work.

The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service - the GMC's new tribunal service for UK doctors which came into force last June - replaced the interim suspension with a conditional registration order.

He can now practise again so long as he tells the body when he accepts a job, confines himself to plastic surgery, consults with female patients in the presence of another medic and refrains from photographing female genitalia without consent.
