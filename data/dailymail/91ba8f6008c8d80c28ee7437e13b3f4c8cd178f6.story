When the first episode of Match of the Day was screened 50 years ago this month there were more than twice as many people inside Anfield watching Liverpool play Arsenal than there were watching on TV later.

John Motson, the veteran broadcaster who would go on to become such an integral part of a programme that remains a Saturday night comfort blanket for millions of football fans, was among that select audience of just 20,000 people who tuned in to see a highlights package of Liverpool’s 3-2 win.

The programme back in August 1964 was low-tech, without fanfare, only available on BBC2 to viewers in and around London, and barely made it to a second season. And, just as today, it was TV rights and money that was almost its undoing.

Wrapped up: John Motson, the veteran broadcaster, believes Match of the Day still plays an integral role

Many clubs, fearing this new programme would drastically reduce gates, were involved in a two-month stand-off with the BBC at the end of the 1964-65 season as they demanded more cash from the corporation. And they got their way as the Beeb caved in, agreeing to double the clubs’ collective fee to — wait for it — the princely sum of £25,000.

Given that any club, from Manchester United to Bradford Park Avenue, could have appeared on Match of the Day, the new money worked out, on average, at £271.74 per club per in 1965-66. Last season, Manchester City alone raked in £72million in TV money while this coming season, 2014-15, the BBC are paying £59.9m to show highlights of the Premier League alone. Sky and BT Sport are paying £3bn for top-flight rights over three years.

Times may have changed where money in football is concerned, but the enduring charm and relevance of Match of the Day hasn’t, certainly not in the opinion of two of its doyens, Motson and Barry Davies.

‘A lot of people have grown up with it,’ says Motson, 69. ‘It’s traditional, it’s safe, and it’s predictable in the sense you know what you’re going to get. That’s why you turn it on.

‘At the end of the week Match of the Day presented a comprehensive, detailed round-up of exactly what had gone on. People felt when they turned it off and went to bed at 11.30pm they had caught up with all the football news.

‘I do still think that’s the case, you only have to look at the audience figures. It gets between four and five million and I can think of a lot of programmes on a lot of channels which would love those numbers.’

Davies, who worked on the programme from 1969-2004, said: ‘It wasn’t available to the whole country when it started and many people thought it would never catch on. The powers-that-be were certain that it would, and after England won the World Cup in 1966, it really took off.’

After two years on BBC2, MOTD made the leap to BBC1, following the heroics of Alf Ramsey’s England team, even though league champions Liverpool and FA Cup holders Everton were among a minority of clubs still unhappy with it.

‘The viewers’ sense was they were watching the best football in the world, and England were the best having won the World Cup,’ says Davies. ‘Pubs would empty just before 10pm on Saturday so people could get home to watch it. It sounds extraordinary now, but it was true. I was in awe of it as a programme.’

Motson’s big breakthrough came when Hereford upset Newcastle United in the third round of the 1972 FA Cup and the match was promoted to top of the running order. 

‘It was originally called Match of the Day because they were only allowed to show one game,’ he says. ‘Ken Wolstenholme presented the first show from the pitch at Anfield, there was no studio. When I started there were only four cameras; two up on the main gantry, one lower down and, if they were lucky, maybe one behind one of the goal.

‘In my first decade, with Barry Davies doing the other game, the BBC only had one machine to replay action and that was used on the Saturday afternoon racing. So when a goal was scored in one of our games, Barry or I had to retrace it as best we could as the players ran back to the centre circle. 

‘I would just hope I’d got the passing movement right. Then they put the pictures in later in the evening. Now, when a goal is scored, I get about five replays, probably two more than I need.’ 

Davies joined the BBC from ITV in the summer of 1969, a few months before his 32nd birthday, to commentate primarily on north-west matches. He would become part of a line of treasured household names associated with the show, from Wolstenholme and David Coleman in the early years, to Jimmy Hill, Motson, Des Lynam and Gary Lineker.

Davies’s first assignment was supposed to be covering Leeds against Tottenham on August 9, 1969. But over breakfast he was told Coleman had laryngitis and would miss his own match, Crystal Palace against Manchester United, for which Davies was now expected to stand in. He dashed to London.

‘My preparation was virtually nil,’ he says. He commentated on a 2-2 draw and then hurried to the BBC’s Lime Grove studios where he helped Frank Bough to present that night’s MOTD, as two Palace players, Roger Hynd and Gerry Queen, were studio guests.

The 1969-70 experiment of regional second matches did not work. The second match wasn’t always good quality; resources were thinner than now, cameras less common. By 1970-71, more resources were pushed into a two-match show each week, expanding over time to be highlights of multiple games.

‘The biggest change in football in 50 years is, I’d say, that it’s no longer the game of the man in the street,’ says Davies. ‘The general public had a rapport with the players they no longer have. When I started, players didn’t turn up in swish coaches or even swisher cars. You had a chance to establish relationships, as did the supporters.’

Davies’s mellifluous, measured tones can still be found on archive footage accompanying classic clips, such as one from December 1974 when title rivals Manchester City and Derby met at Maine Road. Former City hero Franny Lee scored the winner for Dave Mackay’s Derby, who would go on to win the title. Davies’s prescient commentary summed up the importance.

‘Interesting,’ he said as Lee unleashed his shot. ‘Very interesting,’ he added as it screamed into the top corner. ‘Oh, look at his face, just look at his face,’ he added, telling viewers all they needed to know about the potential consequences.

Every viewer will have their own favourite MOTD moments. Many will recall Alan Hansen, for example, in August 1995, telling viewers after a 3-1 win by Aston Villa over Manchester United: ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ United went on to win the Double that season.

Motson, veteran of some 2,000 games, reprises his argument that the show should not alter too much to keep pace despite being up against an ever-increasing amount of live football on rival channels.

‘It would be inadvisable to suddenly think: “We’ve got to change everything and everybody”. They’ve made one or two moves with pundits but by and large I think the tradition and the historic significance of Match of the Day is its strength.’
