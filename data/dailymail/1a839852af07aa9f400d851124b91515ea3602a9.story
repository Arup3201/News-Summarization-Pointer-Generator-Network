Before repelling Brazil in the biggest shop window of all, Mexico keeper Guillermo Ochoa expressed a preference to remain in Ligue 1 and to play in the Champions League.

But Barclays Premier League clubs will have sat up and noticed the 28-year-old as he helped Mexico to their second clean sheet of the World Cup in the 0-0 draw in Fortaleza.

Man-of-the-match Ochoa is a free agent after his contract with relegated AC Ajaccio expired, but he will surely be snapped up soon after his four sensational saves denied Neymar (twice), Paulinho and Thiago Silva.

Breathtaking: Ochoa flies through the air to deny Neymar

He recently told L'Equipe: 'My priority is to stay in France, but I am open to any propositions. I have improved in the last three years, most notably in handling the pace of games.

'But I was used to top competition when I played in Mexico. I now need to play in the Champions League to be sure of my level.'

On the basis of his performance, he appears to have it all.

A commanding presence behind Mexico's excellent defence, Ochoa displayed lightning reactions and the agility of a cat whenever called upon.

A commanding presence: Ochoa took charge of his area and kept out all that Brazil could throw at him

Jorge Campos was famed for his garish jerseys and ability to score rather than his ability between the sticks. He played in both the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, winning 130 caps for his country.

Brazil striker Fred, who disappointed once again, called Ochoa's saves 'four miracles'. The man himself simply said: 'It was the game of my life.'

He first drew gasps with a moment which has already been compared to 'the greatest save of all': Gordon Banks' astonishing effort to thwart Pele 44 years ago.

Dani
 Alves found space on the right and whipped in the perfect cross for the
 latest incumbent of Brazil's iconic No 10 shirt. He connected with the 
ball beautifully, sending a seemingly goalbound header to the bottom 
left corner.

But there was Ochoa, leaping and extending a strong right arm to keep the ball out.

He was called into action again just 
before the break. As Paulinho and David Luiz bore down on goal, he 
showed immense bravery to deny the Spurs man with another reflex save.

He's at it again: Ochoa showed lighting fast reactions to deny Thiago Silva from close range

With Mexico playing expansive football and going toe-to-toe with Brazil in a pulsating second half, Ochoa once again denied Neymar. He controlled substitute Bernard's cross beautifully, looked up and fired a fixxing left-foot effort towards goal. To his disbelief, Ochoa was there again.

His night did not end there. Thiago Silva looked odds-on to give Brazil all three points as he rose to meet Neymar's free-kick in the 86th minute. But Ochoa's hands were once again strong and the ball went out for a corner. 

Brazi looked on in disbelief and will be relieved to have seen the back of Ochoa.

But will the likes of Oscar, WIllian and Ramires come face-to-face with the curly haired fellow from Guadalajara once again?

Ochoa was in a similar vein of form for Ajaccio when they faced Paris Saint-Germain in the second week of Ligue 1 last season.
