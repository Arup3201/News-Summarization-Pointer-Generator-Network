MailOnline has been named one of the best Android apps of 2013 by Google.

Its top ten named the BBC News app as the best of 2013 in the UK, followed by classified sites Gumtree and Argos.

The Daily Mail’s website, MailOnline, was the seventh best app, according to the list, which was put together by Google’s editors.

The world’s biggest English language newspaper site, MailOnline has 57.3 million monthly unique visitors globally.

It was second only the BBC News app in the media category, beating the Guardian and Financial Times to take the number seven slot.

Google also revealed the games its users had voted for as the best, with role playing game Knights & Dragons voted the most addictive.

'This year, it was your turn to tell us which apps and games are deserving of recognition,' said Google.

'More than 1 million votes were cast in the first annual Players’ Choice: Top Google Play Apps and Games poll.'

The poll also singled out London firm Swiftkey and their alternative keyboard.

However, a recent poll from web analytics firm Distimo found that Apple still has the most lucrative app store, with Distimo estimating that on a typical day in November 2013, global revenues for the 200 top grossing iOS apps were more than $18m.

That compares to $12m for Android's Google Play store, although the report notes that a year ago, the respective figures were $15m and $3.5m.

It also found games are the most popular type of app downloaded, and that app stores are no longer a two-horse race, with Amazon becoming a third force.

'For some apps, the download volumes from the Amazon Appstore started to compete with download volumes in established app stores like the Apple App Store and Google Play,' the research firm said.
