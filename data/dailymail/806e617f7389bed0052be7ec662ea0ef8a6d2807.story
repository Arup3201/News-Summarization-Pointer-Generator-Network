Suffering the post-Christmas bulge already? Consider one of the latest celebrity workout DVDs.

This year the overriding theme is high intensity training (HIT) — or short, sharp interval sessions lasting around ten minutes.

Two years ago Canadian researchers found that people who did four to six 30-second sprints with a three to four-minute recovery three days a week lost more than twice as much body fat as those who ran for an hour at a steady pace three times a week. 

Other studies have shown similar regular HIT sessions get you aerobically fitter quicker than slogging away at slow exercise.

We
 asked Hazel Ponsford from the Latimer Personal Training group, 
Berkshire, and the elite fitness trainers at David Lloyd High Wycombe to
 rate the latest fitness DVDs.

Toned: Geordie Shaw's Vicky Pattison, TV presenter Davina McCall and TOWIE's Amy Childs have all released workout DVDs - but which will get the best results?

Not for beginners: Performing some of Roxy's yoga moves could be difficult

ROXY’S YOGA CONDITIONING

£2.99; www.imcvision.com

THE PROMISE: This is the second yoga DVD from Roxy Shahidi, who played Leyla Harding in Emmerdale.

It
 features three 45-minute yoga workouts — one focusing on the whole 
body, the second aiming to strengthen the abdominal muscles, and the 
third working the lower body.

VERDICT: This is for intermediate level yogis. While Roxy mentions modifications for beginners, few are fully demonstrated.

Many people think yoga is good for them so may launch into this thinking it perfectly safe.

But
 if anyone with knee, shoulder, wrist or lower back problems attempted 
them a slightly wrong technique, it could exacerbate problems.

Watch the DVD before attempting the workouts to get an idea of the moves as some are complex.

Don’t twist yourself out of position to watch the screen —this could cause neck and shoulder strain or lower back pain.

BEST FOR: Experienced yogis 4/10

AMY CHILDS FIT IN 30 DAYS£9.99; amazon.co.uk

THE PROMISE: TOWIE star Amy Childs offers a 30-day programme consisting of five workouts, devised and co-presented by her trainer Drew Rush.

The ten to 15-minute sessions include four different exercises, such as dumbbell work. The idea is to complete between 10 and 40 repetitions of each exercise consecutively, with a 45-second break within each session.

Poor technique: TOWIE's Amy Childs' DVD is pitched at beginners, but lacks instruction

VERDICT: This is pitched at beginner to intermediate level exercisers and you only need dumbbells and a mat.

The basic concept is good, but it lacks concise instruction. For example, it doesn’t say how many complete workouts you should complete in 30 days - you’d probably have to do it at least three times a week to get results.

Amy’s technique is often poor and isn’t corrected by Drew. Beginners are likely to follow suit. Advice on good technique seems to take a back seat and there is little encouragement offered.

BEST FOR: Those who like following strict programmes and know what they’re doing.

Top of the class: Our experts praised Davina's short, clearly presented workouts

DAVINA: FIT IN 15 £20.42; all major stockists 

THE PROMISE: The fitness DVD queen Davina McCall has sold nearly two million DVDs in nine years.

Co-presented
 with trainers Jackie and Mark Wren, her tenth offering embraces the HIT
 trend and claims to get you fit after 15 minutes exercise a day.

There
 are four 15-minute workouts — targeting strengthening and toning of 
arms, legs and abdominal muscles — plus the ‘Cardio 15’ which includes 
30-second bursts of jumping, kicking and squats for ultra-fast 
fat-burning.

VERDICT: The instructions are clear and there are well-demonstrated options for advanced or easier versions.

There’s also great advice on stretching and cooling down, which prevents blood pooling in the muscles.

Start with sessions as stand-alone workouts, as fitness improves do three or four in one day, on non-consecutive days.

BEST FOR: Anyone looking for all-round results

JOSIE GIBSON’S 21 DAY FAT BURN £20.42; all major stockists

THE PROMISE:
 Former Big Brother winner, Josie Gibson, lost six stones in around six 
months and is following the success of her best-selling fitness 2012 DVD
 with three new workouts.

This
 80-minute DVD contains four 20-minute workouts. The first three develop
 speed, stamina and strength through interval training (repeated periods
 of effort in longer bouts that you’d get with HIT).

The
 final workout is a fitness test involving you counting how many times 
you can perform a particular exercise in 60 seconds. The advice is to do
 one or more of the workouts three or four times a week in 21 days - 
which could apparently lead to half a stone weight loss.

Transformed: Big Brother star Josie Gibson has slimmed down to a size 10 after yo-yo dieting

VERDICT: The emphasis throughout, particularly in the final fitness test, is how many exercises you can perform in a set time.

This is a great idea if you are experienced, but if not it is better to slow down and improve your technique.

It’s
 risky to do exercises fast and repetitively if you’re doing them wrong 
as it could lead to repetitive strain injuries and mean you might not 
use muscles effectively.

There
 are no easier alternatives but instruction is clear, it seems fun, it’s
 a good introduction to regular workouts and will make a difference if 
you stick to it.

BEST FOR: Regular gym goers 5/10 

On the reality bandwagon: Big Brother's Josie Gibson enocurages a speedy workout, while Geordie Shore's Vicky Pattison is praised as being good for beginners - with quick results

VICKY PATTISON 7-DAY SLIM£19.99; all major retailers

THE PROMISE: Geordie Shore’s Vicky Pattison says she has dropped from a size 16 to a six doing these workouts every day.

There are six ten-minute workouts that get progressively harder, presented by Vicky and trainer Robbie Thompson.

The
 idea is to do workout one (the easiest) daily for the first week, 
workout two daily for the second week and so on until you have completed
 all of them. Then you do two to four workouts every day.

Trim: Geordie Shore’s Vicky Pattison has dropped from a size 16 to a six doing her workouts every day

VERDICT: The format of this is physiologically sound and the build up from easy to difficult workouts is a good touch.

Progression is important in fitness as you can get injured or lose motivation by doing too much, too soon.

Vicky demonstrates the hard version of each move and Robbie does the less demanding.

No
 equipment is required and all moves use your body weight for resistance
 — so there’s numerous lunges, push ups and squats which are very 
effective at strengthening and toning the entire body.

Sometimes
 views of the moves are compromised by camera angles. But overall it is a
 great regimen that will make a difference in six weeks.

BEST FOR: Beginners looking for quick results.

CAROLINE PEARCE TOTAL BODY COLLECTION £24.99; amazon.co.uk

Planktastic: Former Gladiator Caroline Pearce's DVD is for experienced exercisers

THE PROMISE:
 Ex-international athlete, Caroline Pearce, also known as former 
Gladiator Ice, has released a three-CD set providing ‘over three hours 
of body-shaping workouts’.

The
 first, Total Cardio Burn, is designed to boost fat loss in three, 
20-minute workouts. The second, Total Body Sculpt, features 
strength-based workouts designed to tighten the arms and shoulders, legs
 and bottom and our midsection. The third, Total Body Blitz, provides a 
mix of fat blasting and toning in five ten-minute workouts which can be 
done on a pick and mix basis.

VERDICT: These DVDs are aimed at experienced exercisers. Caroline mentions easier versions of moves, but they are never shown.

In
 the Pilates section on the ‘Blitz’ DVD, there are not enough prompts 
about positioning such as keeping your back straight and knees soft 
which could lead to strained back muscles.

Many exercises involve rotation which may cause muscles and ligaments being pulled or strained if done incorrectly.

There’s
 an assumption everyone can do planks —when you raise your body in a 
straight line supported by forearms and feet — and press-ups, which is 
untrue.

If you are fairly fit, there is plenty of variety and doing a mix of sessions three to five times a week would improve fitness.

BEST FOR: Those who are already fairly fit and who get bored quickly.

'Shambles': Olympic sprinter Samantha Clayton's DVD has shaky camera angles

BE FIT IN 90 £10.29; all major stockists

THE PROMISE: Former British Olympic sprinter Samantha Clayton, joins Iraq war hero-turned athlete and model Garrett Amerine to present this 90-minute programme.

It recommends doing five of the 35-minute workouts a week with two rest days. Includes a workout calendar, 90-day fitness journal and nutritional guide.

VERDICT: This DVD is a shambles — there are shaky camera angles, trainers rambling on when not knowing what to say, and some of the background trainers are out of sync, or do the exercises differently from the presenters and completely incorrectly.

There is no explanation of technique before exercises, they jump straight in and just tell you to follow. As with any regular exercise you would see some improvements if you followed the workouts, but there’s too great a risk of people hurting themselves.

BEST FOR: The occasional exerciser.0/10

JODIE PRENGER FITNESS BLASTS £14.00; QVC

THE PROMISE:
 Biggest Loser star Jodie Prenger’s DVD features six mini workouts of 
high intensity that take ten minutes each, including a warm up and a 
Pilates cool down.

VERDICT:
 Surprisingly good. There are clear instructions on to how far to push 
yourself, progressions and easy options on most exercises to suit 
everyone.

There is a 
good variety of six to eight exercises for each ‘blast’ and Jodie and 
her friends ask for a full range of motion for each, which is good 
advice.

But using baked bean cans for weights would be ineffective and proper 3-5lbs dumbbells would be better.

This will get results if done four to five times a week doing one mini workout a time, then building to two or three a day.
