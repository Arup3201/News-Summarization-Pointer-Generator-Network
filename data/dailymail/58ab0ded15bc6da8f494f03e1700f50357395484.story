An artist has gone nuts at the prospect of the World Cup and has carved the faces of five English football legends out of a handful of Brazil nuts.

Using just a scalpel, magnifying glass and a 99p bag of Brazil Nuts, Quentin Devine spent around four days carefully engraving the portraits of Gary Lineker, Paul Gascoigne, David Beckham, Alan Shearer and current England star Wayne Rooney.

The artist, from Surrey, said he worked through more than 50 nuts in the challenge, which was set by TV channel Dave to celebrate its World Cup coverage, before he got it right.

The faces were carved out of Brazil nuts as part of a challenge set by TV channel Dave to celebrate the England's top 19 footballing heroes for coverage in the run up to the World Cup

He said: ‘When Dave asked me to carve the faces of five of England’s most loved football legends out of Brazil nuts I knew it would be a challenge.

‘The nuts can be very oily and extremely brittle but I think I managed to successfully capture the essence of each these football heroes.

‘My final piece, Gary Lineker, proved to be a tough nut to crack with his large ear span reducing the already tiny surface area I had to work with.

‘After over 20 attempts, many broken ears and all hope lost, I finally perfected it.

‘On another note, I know Dave is a comedy channel, but an Irish man carving English footballers into Brazil nuts is a real joke isn’t it?’

The channel is showing a succession of shows around Brazil 2014 including specials on England’s football heroes, its best goals and its worst gaffes.

The artist also carved the portrait of Gary Lineker (pictured left playing for England in 1990) and football legend Alan Shearer (pictured right playing for the country in 2001)
