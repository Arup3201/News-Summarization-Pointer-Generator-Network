West Bromwich Albion boss Tony Pulis has been named the Barclays Premier League manager of the month for February.

The Baggies were unbeaten in their four league matches and kept clean sheets in three of them as they beat Swansea and Southampton and drew at Sunderland and at home to Burnley.

Pulis has guided West Brom to 13th in the table, eight points clear of the relegation zone, since taking over in January.

The award is Pulis' second after his previous success came in April last season, when he was in charge at Crystal Palace.

He said: 'It's a fabulous month and we needed a month like that really to give us the impetus hopefully to push on and get the points that we need.

'There are 10 games to go and were are still desperately in need of the points – 10 more points, if we can get 10 more points we get to 40 points, we'll be OK.

'The supporters will be absolutely delighted for us just to get through this.

'I think they understand and they know there will be lots of changes at the end of the season right through the club, so we just need to get through this period.'

On Saturday, Pulis welcomes his former club Stoke, now managed by Mark Hughes.

The Potters also enjoyed a successful February with the only blot a 4-1 defeat to Manchester City as Hughes guided his side to victories over Hull and Aston Villa and a draw at Newcastle.
