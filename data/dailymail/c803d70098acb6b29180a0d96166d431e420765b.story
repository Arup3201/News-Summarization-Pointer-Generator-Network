Joachim Low's Germany squad received a warm welcome at Frankfurt airport before setting off on the 12-hour flight to Brazil for the World Cup.

Fans turned up in their droves to wave off Bastian Schweinsteiger and Co as Germany bid to become world champions for the first time in 24 years.

Low's men certainly look capable of having an impact in South America as they thrashed Armenia 6-1 in their final warm-up game before jetting off.

Waving goodbye: Manager Joachim Low acknowledges the Germany fans at Frankfurt airport

Despite his side's exploits in front of goal, Low was left to rue Friday's friendly as key midfielder Marco Reus picked up an ankle injury which has ruled him out of the World Cup.

The Borussia Dortmund midfielder's absence will surely be felt by the Germans, but the rest of the squad still appeared in good spirits as they acknowledged fans and posed for a traditional picture on the steps of their private plane.

Arsenal forward Lukas Podolski also got in on the act, snapping a picture of himself with team-mates Mesut Ozil, Sami Khedira, Per Mertesacker, Roman Weidenfeller and Schweinsteiger and posting it to Instagram along with the message: 'Hello from the plane! On the way to Brazil!'

Germany face Portugal in their opening Group G game on June 16, before fixtures with Ghana and the USA.
