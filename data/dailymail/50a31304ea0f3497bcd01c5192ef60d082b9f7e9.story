A 15-year-old rugby player who broke his neck during a horror tackle will soon return to school.

Curtis Landers, dubbed the'miracle boy', was told he would never walk again but proved doctors wrong when he took his first miraculous steps to recovery just five weeks after the accident.

He has already returned to his Forster home, in NSW north-coast, where he will prepare to go back to school.

Back on his feet: Curtis Landers can now take small steps after his accident on the rugby field in May

Progress: Curtis was paralysed after fracturing his C2 and C3 veterabrae on the field in Port Macquarie, NSW

The teenager, who was paralysed after fracturing his C2 and C3 vertebrae  on the field in Port Macquarie, NSW, has wowed doctors and physiotherapists with his staggering rehabilitation.

Curtis was bedbound and in intensive care at Royal North Shore hospital after his May 24 accident, but can now stand on his feet when assisted by nurses at Westmead Children's Hospital, Sydney.

A fundraising page set up to support Curtis, said: 'Just got back from visiting Curt over the weekend. Blown away by how much progress he is making.

'Curt has started going for short walks outside using a support harness and he is really looking forward to starting his hydrotherapy on Tuesday.'

The Forster-Tuncarry Hawks junior player can be seen standing and holding a ball as a rehab staff member holds onto his back, in moving pictures posted on the Facebook page which now has over 12,000 supporters.

On 27 June a friend wrote: 'Curt had a great day in physio today. More and more progress every day. Keep the determination going mate!'

On the move: A Facebook update said 'Curt has started going for short walks outside using a support harness'

There has been a huge groundswell of support from Curtis' local community and the top echelons of Australian media and thousands of dollars have been raised for the teen's future so far.

Warren Blissett, a coach of the rising young star, said: 'Ideally we want to get a block of land, put a house on it, and put it in Curtis' name.

'It's the good spirit of country folk.'

The Forster-Tuncurry Hawks are also staging an auction on July 31 in the hope of raising tens of thousands of dollars for their embattled young player.

Radio host Ray Hadley - who visited Curtis in hospital - has already signed on to host the event.

Mr Blissett said Curtis is now able to talk and his mischievous spirit is starting to return.

'He's bossing his dad around, telling him to do this, do that,' Mr Blissett joked.

'That's brought a real smile to (his father's) face. He can see improvement.'

Curtis has also met with NRL hero Alex McKinnon in hospital and a photo of the pair in wheelchairs was posted to the Curtis Landers: Road To Recovery Facebook page.

The Knights forward was also in Royal North Shore undergoing treatment for a fractured c4 and c5 vertebrae he suffered in a devastating tackle on March 24.

Curtis and McKinnon spent hours talking and swapping support and advice.

While the fourteen-year-old's father Kevin is 'still feeling raw emotion' and enjoying alone time with his son, Mr Blissett heaped praise on the talented rugby league player who is improving by the day.

'Now that he can communicate, it's a huge lift in his spirits,' said an emotional Mr Blissett.

'He's got quality, he's able to speak...He's so well mannered. He's one of those boys where if you had to have another son you'd be happy to have him.'

Champ: Curtis is a talented rugby league player who recently took part in a Canberra Raiders camp for country recruits

Curtis, a 'Canterbury Bulldogs nut', recently played in the Canberra Raiders country recruit camp, where he was coached by rugby league legend Ricky Stuart.

An NRL spokeswoman told MailOnline the idea to have Curtis deliver the ball to the middle of the ANZ turf on Grand Final Day has been submitted to senior events staff and One Community - the NRL's charitable and community relations branch - and that it will be considered.

She said the plan was dependent on Curtis' recovery and any grand final day commitments already in place between the NRL, corporate sponsors and other community organisations.
