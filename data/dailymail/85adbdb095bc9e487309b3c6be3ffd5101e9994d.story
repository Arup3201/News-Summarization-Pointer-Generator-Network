There's no shortage of candid snaps around of the world's most talked about Supermodel at the moment.

She's been pictured happily kissing and cuddling her actress girlfriend Michelle Rodriguez and the pair haven't held back - publicly playing tonsil tennis at a Lakers basketball game earlier this year and frolicking in the sea together on holiday last month.

But the latest photos of Cara, 21, show her getting intimate with another woman.

Michelle's got nothing to worry about of course, as these sultry images are all in the name of work.

British model Cara can be seen seductively puckering up with workmate Ondria Hardin as part of a glamourous YSL beauty campaign.

The pair look super slick, with simple, combed back lose hair and bold YSL colours adorning both their eyes and lips.

Set against a hazy backdrop of a glistening boating lake and park scene, they'd certainly help raise the temperatures on a lazy summer day.

The sizzling images have been released as part of the Baby Doll Kiss and Blush campaign and are a follow up to the recent Baby Doll Mascara and Touche Eclat line where Cara posed alongside model Jourdan Dunn.

Her work for YSL is just a fraction of what's been keeping Cara and her famous eyebrows busy of late.

As well as starring in an array of campaigns including Burberry, Chanel, DKNY and walking for designers Karl Lagerfeld and Giles Deacon at Fashion Week, Britain's busiest model is also a prolific poster on Instagram - sharing images of her day to day life.

But aside from work it's her love life that's been setting tongues (including her own!) wagging most recently.

She's the one! Cara Delevigne and girlfriend Michelle Rodriguez smooch in the sea during a sunshine holiday in Mexico

The loved up clothes horse seems well and truly smitten with her lady, 35-year-old Fast & Furious star Michelle Rodriguez who she's been dating for the past few months.

Michelle was seen supporting her supermodel other half at London Fashion week in February and last week the couple were pictured looking very happy and in love on a beach in Mexico.

Life's a beach for Cara at the moment as she enjoys the limelight as Britain's most successful model and seems to have found love with American actress Michelle Rodriguez

In fact when they landed Stateside following their romantic getaway they still couldn't keep their hands off each other and were snapped canoodling before jumping into a waiting car.
