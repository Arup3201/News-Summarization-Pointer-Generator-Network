A drug can prolong the lives of patients with advanced bowel cancer by six weeks.

Patients taking the medication lived an average of 13.5 months compared to 12 months if given a placebo.

Zaltrap, which cuts off the blood supply to tumours, has now been licensed for use in the late stages of the disease. It will be offered to people who have not responded to chemotherapy.

Prolonging lives: Cancer patients on Zaltrap lived an average 13.5 months compared to 12 months on a placebo

Mark Flannagan, CEO of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: 'This is excellent news. We welcome any treatment which gives new hope  to and improves the prospects of patients living with metastatic colorectal cancer in the UK. '

Results from the study of 1,266 patients also found those given the drug also had an improvement in the time they lived before their cancer progressed - 6.9 months compared with 4.7 months for those on a placebo.

At 30 months the improvement in survival was almost double for Zaltrap, with survival rates of 22 per cent compared with 12.0 per cent for placebo.

Almost 40,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year in the UK, with around 5,000 having advanced disease.

'Excellent news': Beating Bowel Cancer CEO Mark Flannagan said he welcomes any treatment which gives people hope

Professor David Ferry, Consultant Medical Oncologist, Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, said patients would be eligible for the drug if previous chemotherapy had failed.

He said the advance in survival was significant, particularly as the drug worked in a different way from existing agents.

Zaltrap is an angiogenesis inhibitor which works by cutting off the blood supply to tumours.

Prof Ferry said 'Between a third and a half of patients get prolonged benefit and it is well tolerated, with few side effects.'

A course of treatment costs around Â£6,000 and the drug has yet to be assessed for approval on the NHS by the drug rationing watchdog Nice (National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence).

Protests by cancer doctors in the US last autumn led to a price cut by French drugmakers Sanofi.

Prof Ferry said 'I'm optimistic that Nice will find its cost-benefit ratio acceptable and give patients a new option.'

Dr Rob Glynne-Jones, Macmillan Lead Clinician in Gastro-Intestinal Cancer, at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Northwood, said advanced bowel cancer was a difficult disease to treat.

He said 'The goal in recent years has been to develop more targeted therapies which aim for high efficacy but with reduced side effects.

'Zaltrap is a novel agent which has produced results that extend life in the later stages of colorectal cancer and has the potential to significantly impact survival rates in the future.'
