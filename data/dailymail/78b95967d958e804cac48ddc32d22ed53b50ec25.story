At 7,500 ft above sea level, a small village near the Mount Bromo volcano is privy to some stunning views.

Each morning, as the fog rolls in along the vast plain at the edge of the Cemoro Lawang crater, local villagers are treated to a magical scene.

The crater is in the middle of the East Java, Indonesia plain, which is known as the Sea of Sand.

Doctor Nat Wimolsiri, 27, recently visited the site while travelling and watched overnight as the blanket of fog overtook the surrounding areas. 

'This is a usual scene for the area where Mount Bromo is located,' he said.

'The plain is usually covered by fog and becomes a sea of fog in the early morning.'  

Nat's photographs were taken from a higher viewpoint on the nearby Mount Penanjakan, which is accessible by jeep.

At night, lights from jeeps driving through the valleys glow orange underneath the mist, which you can see in Nat's images. 

For the evening photos, Nat opted to take multiple images with different exposures and blend them.

'It was amazing and very impressive - I think others would think so,' he added.

Waves or fog? It may be hard to believe, but this Indonesian crater is nowhere near any sea
