A mother accused of sexually seducing her underage son's friend during a sleepover, telling him he could 'pretend to be 18 for the night,' was arrested March 1.

36-year-old Wendy Crowell now faces seven criminal charges, six of which are felonies, tied to sexual assault on a minor between 15 and 16 years old.

When a police detective questioned Crowell at her Grand Junction, Colorado home, she claimed she exchanged texts with all her son’s friends.

A gut feeling led the boy’s mother to suspect a possible relationship between her son and Crowell.

An arrest affidavit reveals the mother eventually found on her son's cell phone about 20 ‘flirtatious’ text messages between Crowell and her son.

Crowell and the boy’s mother had spent some time together and the mother would often leave her son with Crowell while she searched for jobs.

The mother said Crowell would often take their two sons rafting and on other, similar trips.

According to police, Crowell seduced the boy one night while he was sleeping over with her son.

According to the affidavit, the two subsequently had sex five times in three weeks and two of those times while parked in Crowell’s car.

The boy’s mother first alerted police to what she believed was occurring between her son and Crowell in June 2012.

Crowell has initially brought in for questioning the 26th of that month, when DNA samples were taken and her phone examined.

Investigators found what they say is enough evidence to prove the boy and Crowell engaged in sexual acts between May, 20 and June, 20 of 2012.

The boy claims no force was involved and that the sex was consensual, while acknowledging Crowell could have been taking advantage of their age disparity.

Crowell was booked into custody at the Mesa County Jail with bond set at $10,000.

She is next due in court March 14.
