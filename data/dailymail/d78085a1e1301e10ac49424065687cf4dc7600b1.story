A man suspected of murdering his ex-girlfriend was also wanted for questioning over claims he raped her, sources revealed today.

Mother-of-two Linzi Ashton was battered to death in a 'sustained and vicious' attack at home after making a string of calls to police over claims of domestic abuse against ex-boyfriend Michael Cope.

Police made 'numerous' attempts to arrest the 28-year-old after Miss Ashton, 25, of Salford, Greater Manchester, was interviewed by detectives over a rape allegation.

But he was not tracked down and police fear Cope returned to kill the blonde barmaid in revenge.

They have urged Cope to give himself up
 for his own safety after vigilantes threatened to kill him if officers 
didn't find him first. The public were told not to approach 
him and police warned anyone found harbouring or assisting him could 
expect to be in 'very deep trouble'.

Greater Manchester Police Superintendent Kevin Mulligan said: 'If anyone is harbouring this individual they will be prosecuted. This is a serious offence and we need to track down this man.

'He does have a history of violent and aggressive behaviour and he does represent a risk to the community. The community, or members of the community, must know where he is.

'They need to pass on that information to us as soon as possible - and that information will be treated in the strictest of confidence.'

The attack on Miss Ashton was 'sustained and vicious', Mr Mulligan said. Police and Crimestoppers have announced a £5,000 reward for anyone who has information leading to the arrest of Cope.

Cope has previous convictions for violent behaviour and has served time in custody, he confirmed.

Miss Ashton's body was found with head and facial injuries at her home 
in the Winton area of Salford on Saturday.

Cope had been in a brief 'acrimonious' relationship with the barmaid who worked at the Duke of York pub in nearby Eccles.

Police said local man Cope was still likely to be in Salford and that his family knew officers were looking for him. A Home Office post-mortem examination concluded Miss Ashton died as a result of pressure to the neck and multiple injuries.

Detectives said they are keen to hear from anyone who saw her and Cope together on Friday night.

'We believe he is a dangerous and unstable individual and should not be approached. I am appealing for anyone who knows where he is hiding to do the right thing and call police.

'We have also established that Linzi and Michael were out together on Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday morning.

'If you were out and saw them together at any point Friday night or Saturday it is vitally important you call the police.'

The case has been referred to the 
Independent Police Complaints Commission to determine if officers should
 have done more to protect the vulnerable mother. 

Miss Ashton – who had daughters 
Daisy, two, with previous partner Liam Grime, and Destiny, seven,  – is said to 
have ended a short relationship with Cope in the past few days.

Police had been called to several domestic incidents at her Salford home over the past three months.

She was last seen alive at a friend’s house at 2am on Saturday, and her 
body was discovered by the father of her children, Liam Grime, at 6pm that evening.

Mercifully, her children were out at separate
playdates with friends. Today Mr Grime said he was among the people who made the ‘grim’ discovery.

He told Sky News: ‘I found her. I was
 at the house when she was found. Me, my sister and my mother-in-law 
found her. I’m not going to go into the specifics but it was grim.

‘The image will be forever burned in 
the back of my mind. I’m in a bit of a state of shock as comes 
naturally. I’m focused on looking after my daughter so that’s keeping me
 going.

‘I don’t think I’ll ever get over it but I’ve got to. I’ve got to look after my daughter.’

When asked how he was coping, Mr Grime replied: ‘I’m forcing myself to at the moment because I’ve got a daughter to think about who has unfortunately lost the most important woman in her life.

‘But I’ve got to do both jobs now. I need to man up and look after her.’ He added that the mother of his daughter was a ‘one off’.

‘Everybody loved her. She was the love of my life and there’s never going to be anybody like her, ever,’ he said.

‘I’ll never be able to find anyone like her. She was devoted to the kids, she was everyone’s friend, she put everybody first and she was a one off.’

Assistant Chief Constable Terry 
Sweeney said: 'As previously stated we know that Michael Cope had been 
in a relationship with Linzi and through that relationship there have 
been reports to police in respect of allegations made by her.

'This includes a serious sexual 
offence and an assault that were reported at the end of April and the 
middle of May respectively.

Miss Ashton was 'brutally assaulted' at her home and police are searching for her ex boyfriend

'I am not going to go into great 
detail about these offences or our involvement, suffice it to say 
Michael Cope was wanted in connection with these matters and numerous 
attempts were made to arrest him.

'Clearly he is now also wanted for 
murder, meaning our involvement in relation to these earlier matters 
will rightly come under enhanced scrutiny and that is why we have made 
the referral to the IPCC and why we are also reviewing these matters 
ourselves.'

Mr Grime, a 
trainee legal executive, posted a picture of their children on Facebook and asked:
 ‘Who could want to hurt her? I love you Linzi xx.’

He thanked friends for their ‘kind 
messages’, adding: ‘Although we were not together, Linzi was and still 
is the love of my life.’

He also posted a picture of Cope, asking people
 to call the police if they saw him. Dozens of bouquets of flowers were 
left outside the Duke of York pub in Eccles.
