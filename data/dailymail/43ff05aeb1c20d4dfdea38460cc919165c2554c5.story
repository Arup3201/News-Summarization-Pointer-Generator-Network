Liverpool and Manchester City are among the clubs watching Real Madrid starlet Jack Harper.

The 18-year-old was outstanding in Madrid’s UEFA Youth League victory over Basle in midweek impressing Liverpool and City scouts among others.

Harper was born in Fuengirola, Spain after his family moved from Barrhead, East Renfrewshire, in Scotland.

He was signed by Madrid at 13 after being spotted playing for local side Los Boliches and despite strong competition from Sevilla.

Under the tutelage of coaches Fernando Morientes and Zinedine Zidane, he has developed into an attacking midfielder with great promise. 

He scored, hit the crossbar and showed some excellent touches in the 2-0 win over Basle, earning a standing ovation when he was substituted in the second half.

Madrid have high hopes for Harper but with first team superstar's blocking his progress, they know clubs are showing interest in the hope of tempting him with regular first team football elsewhere.
