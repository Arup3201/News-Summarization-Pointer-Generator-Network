Shocking: Anne Diamond provoked a backlash from Sky News viewers after she appeared to make light of Megan Stammers' eloping with Jeremy Forrest

Anne Diamond caused outrage yesterday after she flippantly dismissed the hunt for Megan Stammers as ‘a bit so whatish’.

The former breakfast TV presenter said the age gap between the missing teenager, 15, and her maths teacher Jeremy Forrest, 30, was ‘not sickeningly huge’.

Her comments – made during Tuesday evening’s paper review on Sky News – prompted a wave of angry comments from viewers who said the 58-year-old was ‘out of touch’.

Miss Diamond, who has four children with ex-husband Mike Hollingsworth, 68, began by telling Sky News presenter Anna Jones: ‘Clearly, this is wrong.

'He shouldn’t have done it and he must be tracked down and he must be brought to book for it, but it’s just got everybody talking about relationships others had with their teachers.

‘She’s 15, he’s twenty-something.’

The presenter interrupted to correct Miss Diamond about Forrest’s age but undeterred she continued: ‘At any rate, it’s not a sickeningly huge age gap.’

Ignoring the fact that Megan is still classed as a minor, she added: ‘I’m not making light of what is a crime here...but nevertheless, again I feel it’s a bit so whatish.’

Miss Diamond’s remarks come as the hunt continues for the pair following their apparent elopement to France.

Her words sparked an almost immediate backlash among Twitter users.

appalling and senseless.’

Lynn Ede wrote: ‘Cannot believe Anne Diamond on Sky News is saying can’t understand “big” press on runaway pupil with teacher! Have to say, presenter on Sky News also looked pretty shocked at Anne Diamond’s views...’

Richard Dixon wrote: ‘Bizarrely complacent attitude from Anne Diamond on Sky News re girl running off with teacher at school with poor safeguarding record.’

Another user told Miss Diamond: ‘I cannot believe what I have just heard you say. Out of touch. That teacher is a disgrace to all in the profession.’

Paul Bradley added: ‘Anne Diamond on Sky papers. What a travesty. More clueless than she was in the 80s!’

Miss Diamond, who presents a radio show on BBC Berkshire, was unavailable for comment last night.

A spokesman for Sky News said: ‘We do not necessarily condone or agree with comments made by our guests.’

Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, said it had so far not received any complaints about Miss Diamond’s comments.
