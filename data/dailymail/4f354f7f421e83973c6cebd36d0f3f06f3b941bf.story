The controversial badger cull cost an astonishing £4,100 per badger, it was claimed last night.

It is estimated that the cull, which ended with just over half of the planned 5,000 badgers being killed, cost £7.3million in total.

The taxpayer would have picked up the bulk of this – some £5.8million.

Picking up the bill: It is estimated that the cull cost £7.3million in total

The calculations come from animal charity Care for the Wild which described the cull as ‘one of the most disastrous and expensive in history’.

The badger cull, which began last autumn, aimed to help control the spread of TB among cattle by killing at least 70 per cent of the badgers in pilot zones in west Somerset and West Gloucestershire.

But both ended without hitting their targets – despite the initial figures being revised down and the culling periods extended.

Critics described the project as a fiasco but ministers insisted it has been worthwhile.

Care of the Wild pieced together the cull’s cost from answers to parliamentary questions, statistics from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs and Freedom of Information requests.

This put the total cost for at £7.3million – or £4,121 for each of the 1,771 dead badgers.

This included £2.66million for policing the culls, which attracted protestors, and included the cost of overtime, helicopters and four-wheel-drive vehicles.

Another £3.2million is estimated to have been spent by Defra and other Government departments on projects including pinpointing the location of badger setts and monitoring the cull’s humaneness.Farmers, who paid for the marksmen, were billed an estimated £1.49million.

Care for the Wild has also calculated that if the culls are run annually for four years, as planned, the total bill will come to £19million.

However, even if the cull did lead to a drop in TB among cattle, the taxpayer’s bill, including compensation for cattle that have to be destroyed, would only fall by £2.5million.

Dominic Dyer, the charity’s policy advisor, said: ‘Taxpayers will not benefit from badgers being killed, the badgers certainly won’t benefit – and neither will the farmers because culling was always going to be a costly failure.

‘It’s time the Government realised that.’ 

The National Farmers’ Union said: ‘If marksmen had been allowed to go about their lawful business, there wouldn’t have been any policing costs.’
