Former St Helens scrum-half Sean Long has returned to the club as an assistant coach.

The 38-year-old enjoyed 13 decorated seasons with the Saints, winning 11 team trophies and the Lance Todd award for man of the match in the Challenge Cup Final three times.

He left Saints in 2009 for Hull but retirement soon followed due to injury, and he has since drifted around the coaching scene, working with Wigan, Salford and Samoa.

Former St Helens scrum-half Sean Long will return to the club as assistant coach next season 

A move to Langtree Park is a real homecoming, though, and he has signed a two-year deal to work under Keiron Cunningham, his former team-mate who is readying himself for his first spell as the head coach.

Cunningham has replaced Nathan Brown in the top job after he returned to Australia in the wake of his side's Grand Final triumph over Wigan.

Long said: 'I am delighted to be back at a club I love so much. Saints are one of the greatest rugby league clubs in the world and to be part of the backroom team here was too good an opportunity to turn down. It was my chance to come home.

Long will work under former team-mate, and new head coach, Keiron Cunningham at St Helens 

'The opportunity to work with Keiron Cunningham - a team-mate and friend who was and still is a legend at Saints - and the great squad the club has is very exciting.' 

With current captain Paul Wellens also on the staff, Cunningham is pleased with the team he has put together.

He said: 'I am really happy that Sean has agreed to join my team. He is a legend at this club and will bring years of experience not only as a world-class player but also as a first-rate coach.

'He commands respect amongst the playing group and will complement our backroom team perfectly.'
