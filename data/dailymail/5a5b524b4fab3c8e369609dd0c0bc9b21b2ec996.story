Staff at a castle used to film the Harry Potter movies will lose a week's wages when it closes to host a society wedding.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are among those invited to the wedding of Thomas Van Straubenzee, 30, and the Duke of Northumberland's daughter Lady Melissa Percy, 26, at Alnwick Castle tomorrow.

But around 100 staff on seasonal 'zero-hours' contracts - which means they only get paid for shifts they work - have been told to stay away from the Northumberland castle.

Alnwick Castle will be closed as it plays host to the wedding of Thomas van Straubenzee and Lady Melissa Percy

The castle is a popular tourist 
destination having been used during the filming of the Harry Potter 
films and employs guides, broomstick riding instructors and minstrels to
provide entertainment.

But they will miss out on pay during this busy holiday period.

A member of staff told the Daily Mirror: 'People are absolutely gutted. We've been hit hard in the pocket.

Bride and groom to be: Thomas van Straubenzee will marry Lady Melissa Percy in a lavish ceremony at the castle in Northumberland tomorrow

'We can watch the firework show from 
outside and they will pipe the music from the reception outside, but 
that won't pay the rent.'

Guests at the lavish wedding will also include Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, who is a bridesmaid.

The
bride will reportedly arrive at the castle in a horse drawn carriage 
and the ceremony will be followed by an extravagant reception.

Mr Van Straubenzee, a chartered surveyor is a good friend of both princes having travelled on a gap year with Prince William to New Zealand.

William and Harry both attended his stag party in London earlier this month.

The Duchess of Northumberland had said that the family wanted local people to feel that the wedding is cause for celebration.

A spokesman for the castle said that employees have been supportive of the wedding and that it would be impossible to keep the venue open.

The castle, which dates back to 1096, has also featured in 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Ridley Scott's 2010 Robin Hood film

It is a Grade I listed building and attracts more than 800,000 visitors every year making it the tenth most visited stately home in the UK.

It is the second largest inhabited castle after Windsor.
