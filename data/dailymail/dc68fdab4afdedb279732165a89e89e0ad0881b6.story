The state governor Luis Durnwalder said he was not aware of any laws ruling what language can be spoken on the football pitch

A footballer who was sent off for speaking German in a match in the South Tyrol region of Italy has won a discrimination case against the referee.

Referee Fabio Schirru told St. Georgen-Montichiari defender Gabriel Brugger: 'If I hear you speaking German one more time you will be sent off.'

The use of language is controversial in the region as it used to be part of Austria but was handed over to Italy after the war and although technically now Italian, most people in the region still speak German.

The state governor Luis Durnwalder said: 'The local government is not aware of any laws ruling what language can be spoken on the football pitch.

'There are no such rules in place which govern sport.' 

The South Tyrol Amateur Footballers Association said that players should be allowed to use their mother tongue language amongst themselves.

'Nobody can stop them doing that,' he added.

The referee association in South Tirol also backed the player and said that Italian should be the language used with the referee but the use of German is allowed on the pitch among players.

An official complaint has been made against the referee. Durnwalder said: 'I have made it clear that the referee's actions were out of order.' 

South Tyrol is regarded as Italy's richest province and was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but was annexed to Italy in 1919 at the end of the First World War.

Many are native German speakers. 

In the 1920s and 1930s, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini encouraged Italians from the south to settle in the region.

German was banned in schools, courts and public offices and place names were 'Italianised'. 

In 1939 Hitler and Mussolini agreed to give the German speakers a choice - to stay in South Tyrol and become integrated into Italian language and culture or emigrate to the German Reich.

Relations between the two nations improves in the 1970s. 

The Schuetzen, who organise marches in Tyrolean national dress and feathered hats, have long campaigned for reunification with North Tyrol in Austria.
