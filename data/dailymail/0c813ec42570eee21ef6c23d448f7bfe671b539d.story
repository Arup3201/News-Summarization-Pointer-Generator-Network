A dog had a lucky escape when it was thrown out of a car and across a canal after the car it was travelling in careered off the highway yesterday.

The white Cadillac Escalade had been heading eastbound along the Wyoming Highway 230 when it veered off the road and landed in the canal next to it, leaving the female driver so badly injured she had to be carried from the scene by paramedics.

Emergency services workers estimate that the car was airborne for at least 30 feet after it left the highway and plunged down to the east bank of the Pioneer Canal, near Laramie, WY.

The female driver was stretchered off by paramedics following the accident that happened at mile marker 22 yesterday at about 4pm.

Emergency workers who arrived at the scene were astonished to find the pet, a type of cattle dog, whimpering but alive, 20ft from the wrecked car it had been travelling in and on the opposite bank of the canal.

Animal Health Center veterinarians were called, and tended to the animal before loading it onto a stretcher and taking it to the health center for treatment.

Initial reports suggested the dog had suffered a broken leg and injured jaw in the accident, while its owner, who is not being identified until her next of kin has been informed, was said to be conscious and able to speak at the scene.

The Cadillac, which was the only vehicle involved in the incident, was badly damaged.

Wyoming Highway Patrol Trooper Erin Devries told local paper the Laramie Boomerang: 'It appears she failed to negotiate a right-hand curve in the road, went through a fence and went airborne and, once she landed, she landed front-end into the ravine.'

Workers were still trying to salvage the car from the ravine this morning.

Earlier this week, a terrier was rescued
from a Florida retention pond filled with alligators after its owner 
suffered a medical problem and drove into the water.

Mary Arbour, 64, from Laramie, was stopped on U.S.92 in Osceola County, Fla, when passing motorists noticed she was suffering from a medical emergency and called 911.

As they approached to help, her vehicle sped into the deep pond, which was filled with alligators.

Two men and a woman waded into the waters and forced the back door of her Honda CRV open.Â  As the vehicle sank, they managed to get her terrier out, but were unable to save Ms Arbour.

She was later pronounced dead at the Osceola Regional Medical Center in Kissimmee, as a result of Monday's accident.
