A school has said it will send pupils home if they wear a brand of skin-tight trousers named 'Miss Sexy' to class.

Tideway School in Newhaven, East Sussex, told parents in a letter the trousers were 'inappropriate' for their pupils - who are aged 11 to 16.

It added pupils who disobey the school uniform policy - which also bans jeans and boots - could be isolated or suspended.

The letter also suggested parents buy their daughters new skirts if she had 'grown since the purchase' of her last one.

Miss Sexy are a tight-fitting brand of 
trousers, which have a distinctive red label and usually feature a large
 buckle on the front.

They can be bought online or in cheaper shops on the high street for around £10.

Although
 they are not specifically marketed for children, they are popular 
trousers for schoolgirls and are featured on several school uniform 
websites.

The letter said: 'School uniform engenders a sense of belonging and a smart uniform 
encourages a more mature approach to learning.

'Parents
 are expected to give full support to the school uniform policy and all 
students are expected to be in full uniform each day.

'They
 may be removed from lessons and isolated or sent home if they are not 
wearing the correct uniform or if their hairstyle or colour is deemed 
inappropriate.

'The headteacher's decision is final. Trousers must be tailored, not jean or 'Miss Sexy' style.'

Other items have also be banned from the school - such as boots, jewellery and nail varnish.

It said: 'Boots are not permitted, nor are fabric shoes e.g. Vans or  plimsolls.

'Skirts must be one of the school styles, as detailed on the website, and must be an appropriate length.

'If your daughter has grown since the purchase of her skirt please ensure that a new one is provided for the summer terms. 

'Skirts should be worn with plain black tights. Alternatively grey or black socks may be worn.'Ear studs and a watch are permitted but no other jewellery may be worn and hair must be of a natural colour. Nail varnish is not permitted for students.'.

Tideway School is a specialist technology college for boys and girls aged 11-16.

Last year, the school banned 'extreme haircuts' and any style which is not a 'consistent length' or a 'natural colour' will be banned.

Errant pupils were told they would be sent home until their hair has returned to 'normal'.

A school spokesman said today: 'We've not said any specific trousers are banned.

'We said we have a uniform code that specifies types of trousers and skirts our students should wear. We've asked parents to comply with those.

'The uniform code says 'these are the ones' and we'd like people to wear them.

'I don't want to comment on names of trousers as we're trying to keep an appropriate business attire in the school.'

Miss Sexy is a brand of tight-fitting trousers. They are often black in colour and include a distinctive red label. The trousers usually feature a large buckle or zip on the front.

They are not marketed to children - but are popular among schoolchildren. They can be bought for as little as £9.99 on several school uniform sites as well as eBay and Amazon. Cheaper shops on the high street also stock them.

They are sold in women's sizes 6 - 16.

The brand also sell skirts - which look very similar to the trousers with a large buckle. Tops and jumpers are also made by the brand.

Several other schools have banned the brand.

Teachers at Bradley Stoke Community School in Bristol said the Miss Sexy branded garments are unacceptable because of the way they 'cling' to girl students - making them 'unhelpful' to learning.

On forum Mumsnet, other parents have also expressed their concern over the garments.

One user wrote: 'The school has a fair point. Those trousers are skin tight hipsters. Not suitable school trousers for a child at all. Even the name of the brand would be enough to make me think these are not "schoolwear".'
