Brazil talisman Neymar and his national team-mates have jetted off to London having beaten France in Paris.

The Barcelona forward scored a second-half strike to help Brazil defeat Didier Deschamps side 3-1 at the Stade de France in an international friendly on Thursday and now take on South American rivals Chile at Arsenal's Emirates stadium on Sunday.

Neymar took to social media to update fans as he posted a picture sat next to Robinho on the plane over to London.

Following the French victory, Neymar posted a picture with former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry on his Instagram account hailing: 'This is one of the best in football history!!! THIERRY HENRY.'

Henry picked up 123 caps for France during his illustrious career and Neymar appears to be heading in the same direction with Brazil.

The former Arsenal star attended the match with former team-mates Marcel Desailly, Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira  to celebrate their position as national centurions.

Together, they are four of just six players to be capped more than 100 times by Les Bleus, with Didier Deschamps another and all-time leader Lilian Thuram making up the list.

The presence of such national legends couldn't inspire Deschamps side, who were comprehensively beaten by Neymar's Brazil
