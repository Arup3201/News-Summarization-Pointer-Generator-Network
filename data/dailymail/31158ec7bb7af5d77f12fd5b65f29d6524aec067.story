The bereaved girlfriend of a 21-year-old army reservist who was murdered during an attempted robbery on Thursday night says she can still hear the sound of the bullet that killed him ringing in her ear.

The woman, who is also 21 but asked not to be identified, is demanding answers following the mysterious death of her boyfriend in northeast Atlanta - local solider, Xavier Arnold.

Arnold - who was in the Army National Guard reserves as an engineer and was known as 'X' - was on a bike trail in Kirkwood with his girlfriend and a friend at the time of the incident.

The girlfriend said they were taking 'artsy photographs' of the graffiti in the area when they were approached by two men.
