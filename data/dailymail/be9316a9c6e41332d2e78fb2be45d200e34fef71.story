Judge John Lafferty had to adjourn sentence in a child porn case so a fully sighted colleague can view the material

Britain's only blind judge adjourned the sentencing of a pervert so that a sighted judge can decide how serious a child pornography video is.

Judge John Lafferty told Snaresbrook Crown Court on Wednesday that as he couldn't view the video - showing a woman having sex with a boy - he couldn't rule how 'serious' it was.

The court heard defendant Philip Hawkins was arrested on January 15 this year after police found child pornography on his laptop at his home in Stepney, east London.

The 63-year-old, who has previous convictions for child abduction and taking indecent photos of children, was put on the Sex Offenders Register in 2008 after being found guilty of indecently assaulting an 11-year-old boy at a swimming pool.

During a routine police check on Hawkins in January, however, officers found a video of a woman having sex with a boy on his laptop and he was arrested for breaching the conditions of his release imposed five years ago.

Judge Lafferty, however, was unable to judge which of the five categories of seriousness the video fell into, so adjourned sentencing of the case to allow a fully-sighted judge to decide.

He told the court: 'There is clearly what appears to be sexual intercourse between a boy and a woman.

'In my judgement there is a very clear impression that sexual intercourse is going on between the seductress and the boy.

'There is no clear evidence of penetration and the soundtrack does not help.

'Therefore I have to decide whether I am prepared to draw the conclusion whether it is sexual intercourse between a boy and a woman.

'It is not the grossest form of level four depictions that one could imagine.

'However, I am happy to allow a judge who can more aptly see the video to pass sentence and decide which category this falls in to.'

Hawkins will now be sentenced on September 11 this year.
