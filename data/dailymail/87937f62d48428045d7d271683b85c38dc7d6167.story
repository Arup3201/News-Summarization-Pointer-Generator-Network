A father-of-three was so angry that his teenage daughter had defied his rules about going on social media sites and then had etched the name of a boy she met online on her arm that he ordered she remove it with a heated knife.

The 45-year-old beat his daughter with a belt, striking her in the face and on the arms and legs after he discovered the 14-year-old from Solihull had met a boy on Facebook and become so infatuated she used a pin to scrawl his name on her arm in a makeshift tattoo. 

The 'zealous' assault was only discovered when a teacher at the girl's school noticed her injuries. When asked about the incident the father still did not understand what he had done wrong.

A 14-year-old girl was beaten with a belt by her father after he discovered she had defied his orders to go on Facebook, and had met a boy online and etched his name on her arm. The man ordered her to remove the makeshift tattoo with a hot knife and was given a suspended prison sentence after admitting child cruelty 

He admitted a charge of child cruelty and was given a six month suspended sentence. 

Birmingham Crown Court heard that the child, who cannot be named, had been banned from using social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter by her father.

But she started chatting online with a boy, and was so infatuated that she used a pin to prick out his name on her arm.

Graham Russell, prosecuting, told the court the makeshift tattoo was eventually seen by her mother, who then called her father.

Mr Russell said the girl had run upstairs and tried to hold the bedroom door against her father but realised it was futile.

After admitting what she had done, her father told his wife to fetch his belt which he then folded in two.

Judge James Burbidge said the actions of the father were 'zealous and frankly brutal' in response 

'At that point he began hitting his daughter indiscriminately, the blows landing on her legs, hands and body,' said Mr Russell.

During her ordeal, during which she was also struck in the face, the teenager tried to move around on the bed and use a pillow as a shield.

But the 'brutal' attack continued, the court was told.

The assault only came to light after a teacher at the girl's school was told what had happened, and alerted the police and social services.

When later quizzed, the victim's father apologised but said he did not know what he had done wrong.

Mark Jones, defending, said the man was now aware that it was wrong, and had seen the effect on his daughter.

Judge James Burbidge QC told the 45-year-old father: 'You were responsible for chastising your child in a way that was zealous and frankly brutal. The level of violence that was displayed against her was significant. She was still crying for some considerable time after you struck her many times with a belt.

'She was then clearly in need of medical attention. She had done no more than, no doubt, many a child of her age, falling fond of a particular individual and etching their name on her arm.'

He said the man deserved a prison sentence but he knew a custody term would probably harm his children even more. 

Judge Burbidge sentenced the father to six months, suspended for 18 months, and ordered him to do 80 hours unpaid work. 

He and his 41-year-old wife had previously both admitted a charge of child cruelty.

The mother was handed a one-year community order.
