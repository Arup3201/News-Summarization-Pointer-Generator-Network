From using navy color schemes, which attracts bargain hunters, to playing certain melodies that facilitate conversations between browsers and sales reps, marketers use a wide range of tricks to influence our shopping habits.

Scent sells! The smell of freshly baked goods doesn't just entice you to the bakery section of a supermarket, it also makes you think of buying a house, while floral smells can make you browse shops for longer

As for which colors we associate with food flavors, red goes hand-in-hand with sweet tastes, green signals sour, blue evokes bitter tastes, and yellow is associated with salty foods.

And when it comes to our noses, different smells can have a surprising impact on our buying behavior.

It's fairly well-known that lavender and chamomile scents can be relaxing and that citrus scents can make you feel more alert.

Talcum powder on the other hand, can apparently make you feel safe and nostalgic, barbecue smoke can make you perceive a room as smaller, while apple and cucumber does the opposite, and leads people to perceive a room as bigger.

Hands-on: Have you ever noticed how compelling it is to touch clothing in a store as you move through it, even when you have no intention of trying the items on? Marketers are onto this too

Neurologist Dr. Alan Hirsch conducted a study which found that 84per cent of participants were unknowingly willing to $10 more for a pair of Nike shoes shown in a scented room versus an identical pair in an unscented room.

And have you ever noticed how compelling it is to touch clothing in a store as you move through it, even when you have no intention of trying the items on? Marketers are onto this too.

A Harvard Business Review article states that items which are warm to the touch help us feel more trusting, and is thus effective when it comes to high-profile purchases like houses and cars.

The article also cited a study which found that people offered lower prices while negotiating the price of a car if they were seated on a hard chair rather than a cushioned chair.

Apple stores set their laptop computers open at an angle of exactly 70 degrees, which they measure using an iPhone app (of course), to invite touch. This angle is open enough to 'tease' buyers but not enough for them to view content.

Even a two-second touch from another human can influence buying behavior. A Hogskolan i Halmstad dissertation cites that waiters who touch patrons draw in higher tips, and that store employees who touch shoppers encourage more sales.

Tunes: Slower music increases the time you remain in a store and the money you spend - a ploy used by Borders bookstore, as well as countless supermarkets and department stores

As for our sense of hearing, music can have a pronounced effect on our shopping habits.

Classical music increases 'quality sensation', according to the aforementioned dissertation, which makes it useful in wine cellars and spas for example.

Slower music increases the time you remain in a store and the money you spend - a ploy used by Borders bookstore, as well as countless supermarkets and department stores.

Fast music, on the other hand, keeps customers moving out of stores more quickly, which is an advantage for fast food restaurants.
