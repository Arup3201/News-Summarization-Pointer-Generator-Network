It is known as 'Black Eye Friday' - the last one before Christmas, with emergency services stretched to their limits. 

But in Blackpool, as colleagues struggle to arrest a drunken reveller, a WPC appears to find time to take a bizarre souvenir photo. 

As two men drape their arms around her colleague, the policewoman appears happy to snap away, then seems to hand the phone back.

In Blackpool, a policewoman takes a photograph of two revellers as her colleague struggles to arrest a man on the pavement 

She seems oblivious to the struggle going on at her feet. 

The man, pictured with his face planted firmly on the pavement, was later taken away in a policevan. 

Elsewhere a police woman was seen posing for a photograph with another woman as she tried on her hat.  

Lancashire Constabulary were unavailable for comment when contacted last night. 

Police forces across the country were thought to have supplied extra officers on one of the busiest partying nights of the year on Friday.

Last year, sales of alcohol soared by 114 per cent on the Friday before Christmas, with hundreds of drunken patients flooding A&E rooms.  

In Manchester alone between 150,000 to 200,000 people rolled in to town for a boozy shindig. 

Elsewhere a woman in North Wales was arrested for being 'drunk and urinating' at 4pm, while a temporary triage unit was erected in Cardiff.

Earlier this week police forces urged the public to take care while drinking in the run up to Christmas.  

Humberside Police said: 'The festive period is a great time to socialise with friends and work colleagues in the run-up to Christmas.

'Unfortunately, these nights can lead to revellers drinking excessively which leaves them vulnerable to becoming victims of crime and occasionally leading to serious assaults and sexual assaults. 

It comes as crisis-hit ambulance services struggle to meet the high demands of the festive season. 

Senior NHS doctors warned last night: 'Don't be ill at Christmas', with emergency services stretched so thinly.
