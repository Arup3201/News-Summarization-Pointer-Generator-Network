An Ohio couple has been charged with murdering the three teens and young mother whose bodies were found September 12 in an abandoned car on a secluded road.

26-year-old Jacob Allen Bennett was indicted yesterday on four counts of felony murder, four counts of premeditated murder and two counts of aggravated robbery.

His 25-year-old girlfriend Brittany Moser received the same charges, minus the four counts of premeditated murder.

Charged: Jacob Allen Bennett, left, and his girlfriend Brittany Moser, right, were formally charged yesterday in the murder case of four young people in Crab Orchard, Tennessee

Gruesome discovery: A resident found the four murdered bodies on the morning of September 12 in a parked car on a little-used road

New charges: The indictment Friday marked the first time that authorities had listed Moser, above, as a suspect in the case. She was arrested at her home in Dayton, Tennessee on Friday

While Bennett has been in custody since September 13, the indictment Friday was the first time Moser was tied to the case. She was arrested at her home in Dayton, Tennessee yesterday.

The indictment also provided more information on what transpired on the night of their murder.

According to authorities, the couple had a drug deal set up to buy marijuana from 17-year-old Domonic Davis and 22-year-old young mother Rikki Jacobsen.

Drug deal gone wrong: 22-year-old Rikki Jacobson, left, and her 17-year-old nephew Domonic Davis, right, were in the middle of a drug deal with Bennett and Moser when the couple tried to rob them

Victims: Bennett and Moser killed Jacobson and Davis, above, as well as the two passengers in their car, 16-year-old Jonathan Lajeunnessee and 17-year-old Stephen Presley

Bennett and Moser planned to rob the young men of the drugs, but it seems their plan took a deadly turn.

Both Davis and Jacosen were shot, as well as the passengers in their car, 16-year-old Jonathan Lajeunnesse and 17-year-old Stephen Presley.

A resident came across the blue Dodge Neon that was parked on an unpaved road off one of Renegade Mountain's main streets at 7am on September 12.

'They knew that nobody lives on that 
street, and [the car] just looked odd sitting there,' Cumberland County 
Sheriff Butch Burgess told WATE.

Police
were quick to target Bennett in the killings, after he was arrested 
around 1am the next day by the Rhea County Sheriff's Department on 
unrelated charges.

Found: A resident noticed the abandoned Dodge Neon around 7am Thursday morning off one of Renegade Mountain's main streets

Keen observation: The resident who found the bodies told police he thought the car looked odd parked on the road

He has a lengthy criminal history and has been in prison five times, police said.

'The suspect knew the victims to some degree,' District Attorney General Randy York said at a press conference on September 13 but would not provide further details.

During a news conference, prosecutors and police gave no indication of a possible motive.

The community, which was a former ski resort and golf club, is 50 miles west of Knoxville. It is now home to just 43 residents, most of which are young families.

John Moore, the president of the Renegade Mountain Homeowner's Association, told the Associated Press that there have only been minor crimes in recent years, including drugs and break-ins.

'I believe it was just somebody doing something that required an isolated place and it just happened, unfortunately, to be our sub-development,' Moore said.

'There are 10 miles of road on 3,000 acres. It's easy to get lost or be invisible once you get past the gate.'
