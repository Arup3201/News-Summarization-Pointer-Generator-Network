A critically-injured man was found trapped under the dashboard of his car six hours after it was towed away from the scene of the crash. 

Employees from Busy Bees Auto Parts  in Dayton, Ohio, were shocked when they heard the unidentified man screaming for help from inside the wrecked vehicle, initially believing it had been cleared by emergency services.

They towed the car after it broke through a fence and knocked down a utility pole on a road 500ft from the yard at around 3:00am on New Year's Day. The driver was not discovered until 9:00am.

Trapped: A man was found under the dashboard of his car six hours after it was towed away from the scene of a crash in Dayton, Ohio, at 3am on New Year's Day 

Discovery: Employees from Busy Bees Auto Parts, located 500ft from the crash site, were shocked when they heard the unidentified driver screaming for help from inside the vehicle

After seeing the man lying on the floor, a mechanic called 911 and said: 'I towed a car last night. I went to go take care of the lot, this guy’s still in his vehicle.

'To tell you the truth, I don’t know if this guy came back to his car and climbed in it.'

According to WHIO, the caller had opened a car door to throw more debris from the crash inside but stopped when he saw the injured driver and heard him complaining of leg pains.

The individual was taken to Grandview Medical Center where he is in a critical condition. 

Capt. Jeremy Roy with the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office told the station: 'Since the car was now up on a flatbed they opened up one of the doors to put some more debris into the front seat, which is what they normally do.

'At that angle they were able to see that there’s a person in there that had screamed for help.' 

Police officers and firefighters who finished cleaning up the scene at around 4:30am said they did not see the man.

Authorities are now trying to determine whether he had been left in the vehicle by paramedics or first responders or returned and climbed inside once it had been towed.

Roy added that it is an ongoing investigation and it could be a month before officials are able to determine what happened.
