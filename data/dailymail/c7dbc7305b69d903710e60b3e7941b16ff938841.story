Convicted killer Daniel Sonnex attacked a prison guard at Lartin jail in Evesham

A man serving a life sentence for the brutal murder of two French students attempted to construct a glider 
out of fridge shelves, a mattress, coat hangers and bed sheets so he could 'fly out of prison'.

The makeshift contraption, which had been cobbled together by convicted killer Daniel Sonnex, was discovered by prison officer Richard Stringfellow on June 19, 2010, Reading Crown Court heard.

Sonnex was jailed for life in 2008 for the torturing and stabbing to death of Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez.

He was serving his sentence at HMS Lartin maximum security jail in Evesham when he launched an attack on Mr Stringfellow.

The court was told that 27-year-old Sonnex, jumped on the officer's back and holding a knife, shouted:  'I'm going to slit your f****** throat.'

As he was restrained by other officers, Sonnex, who had previously converted to Islam and appeared in court wearing a Muslim headdress, started shouting, foaming at the mouth and chanting in Arabic.

He told the court he attacked Mr 
Stringfellow because the officer had found a 'glider' he was building 
out of fridge shelves, which he planned to use to fly out of the prison.

Asked what his thoughts were on the 
morning of the attack, Sonnex said: 'I thought agents were out to get 
me, both French and British, to assassinate me.

'It was broadcasted across the TV that
me and my co-defendant were used as government scapegoats in order to 
cover up the murder of students who were about to expose the bird flu 
virus.'

The court heard officers were searching for missing shelves from a fridge, which Mr Stringfellow found in the exercise yard.

Sonnex told the court he had been 
building a glider using the shelves, as well as coat hangers, his 
mattress and sheets from his cell, and did not want it to be found.

'I was actually experimenting on making a glider and a shield in order to protect myself at the same time,' he told the court.

'A glider in order so I could fly from the rooftop over the wall of the prison establishment.'

He said when he saw Mr Stringfellow with the 'glider', he feared he would be taken to the segregation unit and killed.

'I have heard rumours of them killing 
within the segregation at HMP Long Lartin, plus I believed that they was
out to assassinate me as well,' he said.

'I thought, ‘I need to get out of here'.'

Sonnex said he remembered nothing 
after the attack until he 'came around' in the segregation unit: 'I was 
screaming to Allah and crying at the same time'.

Asked why he jumped on Mr Stringfellow's back, he said: 'I was just thinking, ‘I'm dead, he is going to kill me'.

In a statement read to the court, 
officer Andrea d'Arienzo said she heard Sonnex shout: 'I am here for 40 
years, kill me now, take me to the promised land,' while senior prison 
officer Alexis Wood said Sonnex was foaming at the mouth and his eyes 
were glazed.

'He was shouting, ‘I want to die, show me paradise, you're all going to die',' she said.

'He was also calling on Allah and his Muslim brothers.'

Sonnex denies a charge of false imprisonment as well as one of making a threat to kill.

The court was told that he admitted jumping on Mr Stringfellow and holding the knife to his throat, but that he never intended to hurt him.

Sonnex, formerly of Deptford, south-east London, is now being held at high-security psychiatric hospital Broadmoor and is taking anti-psychotic medication, the court heard.

Sonnex said he planned to climb up the
fence, move across to the roof, and then glide some 30ft over the 
prison wall. But he said the glider kept breaking up.

Asked in cross examination if he really thought he could fly, Sonnex said: 'I did at the time, yes.'

The court heard that Sonnex had a slew of previous convictions, many including the use of knives.

In
March 2003, when just a teenager, he was jailed for a total of eight 
years for stabbing someone several times, and also for firing blank 
shots from a handgun during a robbery in September 2002, then pistol 
whipping a member of staff.

He has also attacked prisoner officers several times whilst in jail, the court heard.

He
was expelled from school at the age of 12 and attended schools for 
special educational needs, spent his time 'hanging about or at home'.

Born
into a Catholic family, he said he converted to Islam in Long Lartin 
because he had been 'fascinated' by the religion since the age of 17, 
and in the maximum security prison was full by Muslims, who he described
as 'very righteous people'.

Sonnex, who gave a no comment interview to police about the jail attack, was put in segregation at Long Lartin afterwards, and also when he when he was moved to HMP Woodhill in February last year - spending nearly 12 months in segregation.

Describing it as 'mental torture', he said: 'I went completely insane, I went nuts down there. I was messed up, I went nuts, I tried to kill myself down there, I was placed on suicide watch. I just went nuts down there, I went insane down there.

'Words can't really explain how it affected me.'

Sonnex claimed he was attacked in HMP Belmarsh between June 2008 and June 2009 while awaiting trial for the double murders, and said he was verbally assaulted by officers in Long Lartin.

He sought psychiatric help in February last year at Woodhill and was moved to Broadmoor Hospital in February this year.'
