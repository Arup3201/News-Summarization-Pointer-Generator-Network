The investigation into how Bowe Bergdahl came to leave his base in Afghanistan is to start next week, after the Army appointed a General to lead the inquiry.

The two-star General, whose identity has not been released, will examine the events leading up to Bergdahl's departure from the base in June 2009.

Bergdahl, who was held as a prisoner-of-war by the Taliban for five years, finally returned to the U.S. in the early hours of Friday.

Inquiry: A General is due to begin an investigation into the capture of Bowe Bergdahl, believed to be the man circled. The 28-year-old was flown to a Texas base, above, on Friday

After his release was secured when the U.S. negotiated a deal to free five Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, Bergdahl was taken to a military hospital in Germany.

It is not clear when the 28-year-old, who was kept locked in a metal box for two years during his ordeal, will be questioned formally about his experiences.

Although he is described as being physically healthy, Bergdahl is still recovering from the trauma of being held captive by the Taliban.

He was kept in solitary confinement for at least two years after failed attempts to escape his captors.

Military commanders said during a press conference on Friday that Bergdahl was a normal person who went through an abnormal event, and said that part of his rehabilitation process was readjusting to normal life.

'The skills he used to survive his five-year ordeal may not be healthy now,' General Joseph DeSalvo said.

As he continues his rehabilitation at the Army medical center in San Antonio, Texas, the investigation into his disappearance will get under way.

Part of it will examine what led to Bergdahl leaving his base, which resulted in his capture.

An investigation at the time concluded that he had left of his own free will, but a military official has told CNN the Army has no definitive proof that he deserted.

Bergdahl has not yet been reunited with his parents. It is not unusual for former hostages to delay meeting close friends and family, as it can be an emotional strain.

Overjoyed: Bergdahl's parents, Jani and Bob, pictured with Obama, have not been reunited with their son

A spokesman for his parents, Bob and Jani, said they were overjoyed that he had returned to the U.S.

They are waiting for the right moment to visit their son, who is currently being cared for by a specially trained team who have been preparing for his return since he was first taken hostage.
