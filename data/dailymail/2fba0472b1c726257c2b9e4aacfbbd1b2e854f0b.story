When Mad Men star Vincent Kartheiser bought his first Hollywood home, he veered a little off script - opting for a tiny, one-bedroom bungalow over a lavish mansion in the hills.

And now the 34-year-old actor, who plays account executive Pete Campbell on the hit show, is selling the completely renovated and perfectly designed 603-square-foot bungalow for $808,000.

The compact home on a quiet Hollywood street is filled with clever space-saving designs that make for a sleek and practical living space - from a hidden fire pit to a bed that descends from the ceiling.

When he bought the bungalow for $547,000 in 2004, it was divided up into a series of rooms - but in 2010, he started working with designer Funn Roberts, who knocked down the interior walls to create one large space.

Kartheiser, who is originally from Minnesota, worked with Funn to plan the tiny living space.

'What often happens in our relationship is I come to Funn with an idea and then he makes it into something thatâ€™s actually livable,' Kartheiser told Dwell magazine in an interview last year.

'Because I have these thoughts that seem really interesting, but they're not really good for real life.'

The bed can be hoisted to the ceiling using a pulley system to allow for more space during the day. It's counterbalanced by a 300-lb weight hidden in the closet, Zillow explained.

Smart: When the bed is not being used, it can be hoisted to the ceiling using a pulley system

Space-saving: Once the bed is pulled up, its headboard can be flipped down to be used as a desk

Modern: The designer worked with Kartheiser's original kitchen appliances but used teak for new cabinets

Hidden: Behind a line of back-lit panels on one wall, the designer hid a bathroom and closet space

The bed's headboard is made from a redwood slab that can be pulled down to become a desk once the bed is pulled to the ceiling, Dwell magazine reported.

But when the bed is down, a red curtain can be pulled across a section of the main room to allow for more privacy. When it's not in use, the curtain is hidden behind a closet door.

Other back-lit closet doors line the walls of the home - concealing closets and a bathroom.

Inside the bathroom, there's a stone shower, a tub and a sink carved from a boulder.

There are other secrets in the private courtyard, where a coffee table opens up to reveal a fire pit.

The yard also leads to a detached spa 
room, which includes double showers, a steam room and dry sauna, as well
 as a laundry room and powder room. These are not included in the 
square footage.

Kartheiser is famously frugal, telling The Observer in 2010 that he craved the simple life after finding success in his career.

Outside: Through doorways in the bedroom, there is a private deck which has a fire pit beneath a table

Relaxing: On the other side of the deck, there is a spa (left), which is not included in the square footage

Luxury: The spa area also has double showers for after the visit to the sauna or steam room

Simple: There is also space for one car - although Kartheiser previously said he walks or takes the bus

'It was in response to going to these Golden Globe type events and they just give you stuff,' he explained. 'You don't want it. You don't use it. And then Mad Men started to become a success on a popular level and people started sending me stuff, just boxes of s***. Gifts for every holiday, clothes.

'One day, I looked around and thought "I don't want this stuff, I didn't ask for it". So I started giving it to friends or charity stores, or if it is still in its box I might sell it for a hundred bucks. I liked it so I didn't stop.'

He even lived without a toilet for a while - he would use the neighbors' instead - while the home was under construction.

But after 10 years of owning his little slice of Hollywood, Kartheiser, 34, is perhaps looking to move somewhere larger with fiancee and fellow cast member, Alexis Bledel, 32.

The pair began dating in 2012 and became engaged in early 2013.

The home is being sold by Tregg Rustad of Rodeo Realty, which calls the listing 'a rare offering of an incredibly well designed home'.
