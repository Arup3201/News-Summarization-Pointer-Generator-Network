Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel went into the clash against Bournemouth walking a disciplinary tightrope.

Securing a place in the Capital One Cup semi-finals would have been paramount in the Liverpool duo's mind. But so was Sunday's crunch Premier League clash against Arsenal, with the pair just one booking away from a suspension.

It didn't stop the Liverpool skipper throwing himself into a dicey lunge on Simon Francis inside the opening 10 minutes.

He only lives round the corner, so it was no surprise Tony Pulis was at Dean Court on Wednesday night.

The 56-year-old was doing some punditry work for BBC 5Live for Wednesday's quarter-final. Pulis has been out of work since leaving Crystal Palace just days before the start of the Premier League season.

Knowing Pulis, he'd much rather be in the dug out than the press gantry.

While some saw this tie as the opportunity for another slip-up by Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool, their victory at the Goldsands Stadium had a sense of inevitability about it. That might be down to their impressive goalscoring record at this stage of the League Cup. 

The Reds had scored in 14 of their last 15 League Cup quarter-finals - Raheem Sterling and Lazar Markovic  struck early on to extend that record and help them reach the last four.

Discipline starts at an early age at Bournemouth. The Championship club have enforced a set of strict rules for their academy players, one of which is a £20 fine for inappropriate posts on social media sites.

Other fines include £10 for having a mobile phone switched on in the dressing room, and £20 for a breach of curfew.

No matter the outcome, Bournemouth knew they were making history against Liverpool. The encounter was the Cherries’ first League Cup quarter-final.

The way Eddie Howe’s side are performing at the moment, it may not be too long before their next. Top of the Championship with promotion looking a real possibility, it seems the only way is up for this very promising Bournemouth side.
