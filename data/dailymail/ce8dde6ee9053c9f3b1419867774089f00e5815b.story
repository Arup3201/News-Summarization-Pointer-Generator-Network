The final of the world's leading male beauty contest is upon us, and Britain has three strong contenders flying the flag for the UK. The handsome trio from England, Northern Ireland and Wales are all bachelors in their twenties who take looking good very seriously, with regular workout routines and enviable fitness levels.

But while there's no doubt that our country's offering is strong, competition is stiff from many of the 43 other handsome stallions for the Mister World 2014 title.

From Puerto Rico's handsome pin-up to Australia's hunky personal trainer and Russia's tattooed dark horse, FEMAIL brings you the hottest contenders for the most coveted title in male beauty.

impress during various rounds including Sports Challenge, Talent Award,

winner.

Royal Marine Commandos taking on one of the world's toughest roles for 
their Extreme Challenge.
