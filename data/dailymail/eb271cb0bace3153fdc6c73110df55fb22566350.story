Accused: Spiritual healer Graham Dare denies three charges of sexual assault

A spiritual healer to the stars ordered a female client to strip naked and fondled her, a court heard yesterday.

Graham Dare, 57, boasts celebrity clients including actresses Joely Richardson and Tamzin Outhwaite and TV presenters Melinda Messenger, Kate Thornton and Michaela Strachan.

The boss of Sensitives Clinic in London allegedly ‘groomed’ a 31-year-old Japanese student during her first three genuine appointments, and waived his usual £95 per hour fee until her migraines disappeared.

‘The defendant abused his position, he was building up this young lady’s confidence and trust in him,’ prosecutor Heather Stangoe told Blackfriars Crown Court in London, explaining the abuse began during a fourth appointment on September 14, last year.

‘He asked her to take off all of her clothes and although thinking this was unusual she thought it must have been part of the treatment.’

He reportedly said the clothes were getting in the way of spiritual healing. He then moved his hands all over her body.

Miss Stangoe said the student was ‘wriggling in discomfort’ but, believing the treatment was genuine, booked another appointment for September 16.

The defendant made her remove her clothes and touched her intimately once again, she said.

‘This was no genuine treatment – this defendant was sexually assaulting a vulnerable woman while continuing to claim he was a genuine practitioner,’ Miss Stangoe said.

The victim returned on September 20, but insisted on keeping her knickers on.

The defendant is then said to have ‘put his lips on her hands, arms, legs and abdomen while making a funny noise’ before taking his clothes off and asking the student to touch him.

The complainant made an appointment for the next day that she later cancelled and, after obtaining advice from another spiritualist who dismissed Dare’s methods, called the police.

When questioned by officers, Dare, who has been a spiritualist for over a decade and charges £375 for home visits and £1,256 for one-week residential healing treatments, insisted there was no abuse.

He has pleaded not guilty to three counts of sexual assault.

The trial continues.
