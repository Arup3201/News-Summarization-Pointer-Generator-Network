The nanny accused of viciously stabbing to death the two young children under her care has woken from her coma and asked about the welfare of her own family, according to reports.

Yoselyn Ortega, who allegedly stabbed Leo, two, and Lucia, six, to death while the two children were in her care on Thursday, is now talking again - and one of her first questions was to ask doctors about her own family and friends.

Ortega, 50, remains hospitalized from self-inflicted stab wounds, including a broken vertebrae and a deep gash to 
her throat.

She had previously been described as being in a ‘catatonic’ state, 
refusing to talk to police or physicians, and she is yet to be charged for the deaths of the two children.

Investigators plan to speak to Ortega in hospital  - but the New York Post said she will not answer questions, and has appointed a lawyer.

But a source told the Post she did speak to her doctor and 'asked about her family', the source 
said.

Ortega lives with a sister, a niece and her 17-year-old son, Jesus, in a Harlem apartment.

Police have been searching the home but are not believed to have found any motivation for Thursday's events.

Yesterday her sister, Celia Ortega, told the Post that the nanny, who worked for the family on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, just ‘snapped.’

The sister added: ‘We don’t understand what happened to her mind.’

While family members said Ortega had been struggling with money and mental issues, none could 
understand how she could allegedly commit such a heinous act.

Meanwhile relatives 
in Ortega's native Dominican Republic said they were shocked by the 
allegations.

Milaydys Ortega, the nanny's older 
sister in the Caribbean nation, said that her sister 'loved those children.'

She said the family felt the 
nanny was 'unable to do that' and that ''Yoselyn is fair, loving, loving with
those children. She loved them,'

She said the Krims had visited the 
Dominican Republic last February with Yoselyn and stayed at her home in a
middle-class district of Santiago.

'Those children were here,' Milaydys Ortega said tearfully. 'They were happy, running, playing.'

Yoselyn’s 17-year-old son, Jesus, 
told Milaydys that his mother was innocent.

‘Auntie, I know it couldn’t 
have been my mother,’ he said, according to the New York Post. ‘Those 
kids were like my brother and sister.’

Miladys said Yoselyn is 
the youngest of six siblings, most of whom live in the United States.

Her sister emigrated to America in the early 1980s after graduating from
accounting studies at Santa Ana College in Santiago.

Yoselyn Ortega worked as the manager 
of a print shop in Manhattan, until she separated from the father of her
child. She returned to Santiago for a while, but then went back to the 
U.S., her sister said.

Miladys Ortega said that when her 
sister got back to New York, she couldn't find an accounting job and 
decided to work as a nanny because she loves children.

During her last conversations with Yoselyn, her sister didn't say anything that seemed unusual.

Meanwhile, the parents of the two children, Kevin Krim and wife Marina 
Linsley Krim, are in seclusion with their surviving daughter 
Nessie, aged three.

At the time of the attack, Marina and Nessie has been taking swimming lessons at the nearby Jewish Community
Center, and planned to meet Ortega and Lucia and Leo later in the day at a dance studio.

But when Ortega did not turn up, Marina returned home to find her children dead, and Ortega stabbing 
herself in the throat.

Police said they were unaware of any 
significant history of psychological problems for Ortega, but were 
investigating whether she had recently sought treatment.

Neighbor Ruben Rivas told reporters she seemed to have suddenly aged in recent weeks and had lost weight.

Other friends said that while she was
paid well by her domestic employers, Kevin and Marina Krim, and seemed 
happy with her job, she had suffered a financial setback when she had to
give up an apartment she had rented in the Bronx, and recently moved 
back in with her sister in Harlem.

William Krim, grandfather to the 
slain children, told the Times he wasn't aware of any conflicts between 
the family and the nanny.

'We're just the most stunned people in the world. I mean, they treated this woman so well,' he said.
