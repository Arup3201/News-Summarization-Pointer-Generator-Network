This grinning 20-year-old is accused of battering Tory MP Stewart Jackson when the politician caught him allegedly vandalising a bus stop.

Ivans Karanovs appeared at Peterborough Magistrates Court to face several charges and happily gave a thumbs up to cameras waiting outside.

The Latvian has denied criminal damage and common assault during the incident on Saturday.

Thumbs up: Ivans Karanovs arriving at Peterborough Magistrates Court accused of assaulting local MP Stewart Jackson on Saturday

Tory Mr Jackson, who had been shopping with his wife and daughter in his Peterborough constituency, reported seeing a man throw a beer bottle at a bus shelter.

The backbencher tried to make a citizen’s arrest but the alleged culprit fled after kicking him in the side and chest.

Mr Jackson spoke about the incident on Twitter, he wrote: 'Had set to with violent thug kicking in bus shelter in Broadway & suffered kick in side for pains. @CambsCops came to rescue & now in cells.'

Speaking after the incident the MP added: 'I was walking past and couldn’t just ignore it. That’s when I put my shopping down and went on up and said, “You can’t do that’.”

'I just felt, I live there, it is my city, it is my constituency. When you tolerate that the next thing is that they are smashing up people’s faces.

'I thought any of the shards could have injured a woman or a child so I tried to make a citizen’s arrest.

'He squared up to me and threw a few blows which missed but he swung a kick which made contact but I was not badly injured.

'He then ran away and my wife called the police.'

Afterwards Mr Jackson also thanked Cambridgeshire Constabulary and his supporters, he wrote:

'With regard the incident yesterday credit to @cambscops for their help & prompt response. Thanks for kind messages from Twitter folk too.'

The civic-minded MP's actions provoked a mixed reaction from his Twitter followers.

‏@orderlyplayer
asked whether Mr Jackson should have let police handle the incident, 
tweeting: '@SJacksonMP perhaps you should have had some sense and call 
the police before you went in all guns blazing!'

But other users on the social network were quick to back Mr Jackson.

Daniel Hill, tweeting under the name ‏@IRDanIeL said: '@SJacksonMP Great to see you taking a stand. Hope you're okay!'

District Judge Ken Sheraton, who refrained from comment because he knows MPJackson, granted Karanovs bail until October 3, when his trial will take place.
