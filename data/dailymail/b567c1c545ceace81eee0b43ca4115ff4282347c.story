Hunt: A police helicopter hovers overhead in Imperial, Nebraska, as officers search for Dqayne Lawrence. He killed himself after releasing his wife unharmed

Police searching for Lawrence heard a gunshot coming from a cornfield around two miles north-west of Imperial just minutes after Ms Hanes had emerged unharmed, Nebraska State Patrol Captain Jim Parrish said.

Ms Hanes filed for divorce against her husband on July 30, just two weeks after she had taken a protection order out against him.

Lawrence had planned to kill himself while holding his estranged wife captive, but she tried to talk him out of it, police said.

He abducted Ms Hanes from her workplace at around midday on Saturday from Lincoln where her parents and other family members live.

After she was reported missing, local, state and federal law enforcement officers began searching an eight square-mile area west of Imperial after a police officer spotted Lawrence's gold 1998 Chrysler Concorde before dawn

He sped off, and the car was later found abandoned in the rural area outside of the city.

A motorist reported seeing the couple later walking along a country road in the area The Imperial Republican newspaper reported. They were later tracked down.

Ms Hanes and Lawrence married in 2001.

But she had told a judge that Lawrence had threatened her several times, and he was facing several charges related to a July 8 incident.

Hanes told police that Lawrence fired a gunshot into their bedroom wall and threatened to kill himself in front of her in the hope that she would take her own life. She said in order to get him to lower the gun, she told her husband she would stay with him.

Lawrence had been charged with false imprisonment, making threats and using a weapon to commit crimes.

When he posted $25,000 bond on July 16, he was ordered to stay away from Hanes and any firearms.
