Lara Stone recently revealed that her pregnancy - and the months afterwards - were less about 'earth mother' perfection and more about bloating, limp hair and self-criticism.

She admits that she developed a love of fried food and that it took her a while to slip back into her pre-pregnancy jeans.

But the supermodel, who gave birth to a child with David Walliams' last year, has been working hard to shift her post-baby pounds and now she's ready to show off the fruits of her labour.

She's back! Lara Stone has spent the last few months trying to get her pre-pregnancy body back and she's showcasing the results in her new Calvin Klein campaign

The 30-year-old is the star of the new #mycalvins campaign and has been shot by industry legends Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott.

The throwback campaign is designed to look like Calvin Klein's iconic 1990s ads and Lara looks amazing as she showcases her enviably toned stomach in a series of saucy shots.

What's her secret? While Lara admits that she developed a love of fried food during her pregnancy, she whipped herself back into shape on James Duigan's Clean & Lean diet

Lara has revealed exactly
 how she coped with her pregnancy, the months that followed and the diet
 and exercise regime that helped her get back into shape.

‘Pregnancy
 is supposed to be the most amazing time in a woman’s life,’ Lara Stone 
writes in the foreword to James Duigan’s latest book in the Clean & 
Lean series, Pregnancy Guide.

‘We’ve
 all heard stories of the glowing expectant mum, with toned legs and 
neat bump and the instant and deep connection with her unborn baby. I’m 
sure those pregnancies exist, but mine certainly wasn’t like that.

‘I
 was in maternity jeans at nine weeks. I was bloated all over, had limp,
 greasy hair, no energy and I could eat (and waddle) for England.

‘I
 felt terrible for feeling this way because I actually had an easy 
pregnancy. I had no morning sickness, no bleeding, no pain and my baby 
and I were perfectly healthy. Yet I didn’t get that earth mother feeling
 I’d been hoping for.

Opening up: Lara, pictured, left, when pregnant 
and, right, in September 2013, has penned a foreword in the new Clean 
& Lean pregnancy book and admits that there's so much pressure to 
lose the baby weight within days of leaving hospital

Like many women, Lara says she was keen to stay in shape during her pregnancy. In reality though, while she was aware she needed only 200 extra calories per day towards the end of the pregnancy, she found herself irresistibly drawn to deep-fried foods.

‘We’re only human,’ she says. ‘The most important thing during pregnancy is to grow a little person inside of you which, when you think about it, is the most amazing miracle in the world.

‘There is so much pressure these days to look fantastic during pregnancy and to lose the baby weight within days of leaving hospital. I have nothing against those who do, but it’s not normal.’

Despite her positive outlook though, Lara admits is has been a journey for her to accept the changes her body went through and the fact that it still doesn’t look exactly how it did before.

Looking good: Lara, pictured here in 
Cannes, says that she's a few pounds heavier than she was pre-baby, but 
that's OK because she's happier than ever and she loves every minute of 
being a mother

‘Your body changes hugely during a pregnancy and it takes time to go back,’ she says.

‘I’ve had lots of ups and downs regarding my body image over the past year. On every level I know I should just be happy to have a lovely healthy baby, and I do count my blessings every day.

‘But seeing articles about me that say: “She’s brave to go outside looking like that”, “She’s struggling with her baby weight”, “Is she pregnant again?”, or “She can kiss her career goodbye” is painful. And it sends a bad message to other women reading it, who may be feeling bad about their own baby weight.’

Since giving birth Lara says it has been a struggle to accept the changes in her body, but eating Clean & Lean and making time for exercise has helped.

‘I feel happier, stronger and more confident,’ she says. ‘I’m still not in my pre-pregnancy jeans and I’m a few pounds heavier than I was pre-baby, but that’s okay.

‘I’m happier than ever and I love every minute of being a mum. And I no longer feel the jealous need to unfollow friends who post bikini selfies ten days after giving birth looking amazing. Because everything is just how it’s supposed to be.’

The key to James Duigan’s Clean & 
Lean philosophy is to eat clean foods (as close to their natural state 
as possible), cut back on CRAP (caffeine, refined sugar, alcohol and 
processed foods - find more detail in the book), eat lots of good fats 
(nuts, avocados, oily fish) and limit bad fats (bacon fat, pies, 
processed meats etc). 

In a nutshell, as James says: ‘If it 
didn’t once fly, swim or walk, or wasn’t pulled from the ground, from a 
bush or a plant, don’t eat it! And you don’t have to get this right 100 
per cent of the time. If you aim for 80 per cent, you’ll be okay.’
