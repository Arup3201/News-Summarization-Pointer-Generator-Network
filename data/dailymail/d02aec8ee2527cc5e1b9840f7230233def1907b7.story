Ukip has backed plans to outlaw the killing of animals for meat in the UK without stunning them first

Nigel Farage has been accused of  driving Jews from Britain after his party pledged to ban the ritual slaughter of animals.

Ukip has backed plans to outlaw the killing of animals for meat in the UK without stunning them first.

The RSPCA and British Veterinary Association have called for the practice to be made illegal, but David Cameron has promised to keep exemptions for religious purposes such as Muslim halal and Jewish shechita.

Ukip said it was ‘about time someone stood up for the rights of the silent majority in the ethical treatment of animals instead of bowing down to those who shout the loudest’.

The party’s agricultural spokesman said that losing Jewish was ‘collateral damage’ as there were ‘more votes to be gained’ elsewhere.

In a statement the party said: ‘We respect religious groups to carry out slaughter in the UK according to how they define and read their scriptures.

‘What we do not allow however is for the rights and demands of groups within those religion override the UK’s compassionate traditions of animal welfare.

‘Animal and veterinary science has long concluded that cutting the throats of animals whilst they are fully conscious can cause significant distress and pain.

‘We see no reason why religious groups should not take into account the concerns of animal welfare when carrying out slaughter.’

The policy was adopted by Ukip following a meeting of its ruling national executive committee.

Stuart Agnew, the party’s agricultural spokesman, told the Jewish Chronicle that he had been against the policy change, but had been over-ruled.

He said: ‘There are more votes to be gained and I expect that’s what they were looking for. We’ll lose the Jewish vote for sure, but we might gain votes elsewhere – and that’s what they’re after, general election votes.’

Mr Agnew said the policy was not meant to 'target' Jews - suggesting concern about halal meat traditionally eaten by Muslims was the real driving force behind the ban.

He said: 'This isn’t aimed at you – it’s aimed elsewhere – it’s aimed at others.

'You’ve been caught in the crossfire; collateral damage. You know what I mean.'

Ukip’s decision comes after footage emerged of a worker at a halal abattoir  ‘hacking and sawing’ at animals’ throats

Ukip’s decision comes after a petition demanding an outright ban on slaughtering animals without stunning them first attracted more than 100,000 signatures.

It comes after footage emerged of a worker at a halal abattoir breaking strict rules on slaughtering sheep.

The men could face prosecution for the ‘horrifying yet routine abuse’ captured by animal rights campaigners using hidden cameras.

Slaughtermen at the Bowood Lamb abattoir in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, are seen ‘hacking and sawing’ at animals’ throats in apparent contravention of Islamic practice.

The policy change was met with dismay by campaign group Shechita UK, which said Mr Farage had previously supported the Jewish community’s right to continue the practice.

Campaign director Shimon Cohen said: ‘Citing weak, agenda-led science, Ukip has become the first major political party in the UK to call for a ban on religious slaughter.

‘This latest move is opportunistic and a disappointing shift from Ukip’s previous position.

‘By joining the campaign to prioritise “animal welfare” over the rights and beliefs of the UK’s faith communities Ukip has returned to the fringes of mainstream politics.’

David Cameron has ruled out banning the religious slaughter of animals. Jewish Chronicle editor Stephen Pollard (right) said Ukip were telling Jews 'they may not keep kosher and remain in the UK'

Jewish Chronicle editor Stephen Pollard tweeted: ‘Be clear what Ukip’s stance means. They are telling Jews they may not keep kosher and remain in the UK.’

Figures released by the BVA show the number of animals having their throats cut while conscious has risen 60 per cent in the past year.

Some 2.4 million sheep and goats were killed without being stunned in halal and Jewish shechita abattoirs last year, according to the BVA.

Following the petition calling for the practice to be outlawed, the Government said it ‘encourages the highest standards of welfare at slaughter and would prefer to see all animals stunned before they are slaughtered for food’ but ‘we also respect the rights of the Jewish and Muslim communities to eat meat prepared in accordance with their religious beliefs’.
