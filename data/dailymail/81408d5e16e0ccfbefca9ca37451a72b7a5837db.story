Fighting for her life: Retired nurse Lorraine Scurr is in critical condition in hospital after surviving a horrifying 60ft cliff fall that killed her husband

This is the first picture of the retired nurse who is fighting for her life after surviving a horrifying 60ft cliff fall that killed her husband.

Lorraine Scurr, 65, and her husband Peter, 69, lost their footing on Monday while climbing to a viewpoint over the village of St Aubin in Jersey.

The holidaying couple from Southampton fell and landed on the concrete roof of a Nazi Second World War bunker that forms part of the popular Jersey War Tunnels museum.

Mr Scurr died instantly. His wife 
grabbed some tree branches and locals heard her screams as she clung
to the cliff face before she lost her grip.

Mrs Scurr suffered severe head injuries and was last night flown to a hospital in Southampton, where she is undergoing specialist treatment.

A hospital spokesman said on Wednesday she remained in 'serious' condition.

Emergency services were called by a horrified passer-by who witnessed the fall shortly after 5pm on Monday.

The couple had been taking a stroll along a disused railway line that links St. Aubin to the capital St.Helier.

It's believed they left the path and climbed a steep bank to get a better view of the village below and lost their footing.

Locals said the steep path they used was slippery following torrential rain.

Holidaymakers staying near the scene described how a crowd of people rushed to help Mrs Scurr after hearing her pleas for help.

The woman from Bristol, who did not want to be named, said: 'We heard a lady screaming for help, it was horrendous.

'We ran along Railway Walk and there were a couple of people already there.

'I think she had fallen part of the way and then we heard her fall again onto the concrete roof.'

Jersey Police are investigating the incident, but last night said they 
believe it was a 'tragic accident' and were preparing a report for the 
Deputy Viscount, the island’s coroner.

They added the couple were regular visitors to Jersey.

The bunker they fell upon forms part of the Jersey War Tunnels museum, an unfinished underground hospital and a network of tunnels built by the Germans after they occupied Jersey during the Second World War.

After Jersey was liberated in 1945, the tunnels were turned into a museum which now tells the story of the Nazi invasion of the island
- the only part of the British Isles that was occupied.

The Scurrs, regular guide dog volunteers, were accompanied on their walk by a four-month-old Guide Dog puppy, their eighth, called Skipper.

The Scurrs were walking along Railway Walk, which follows a disused railway line that was taken over by German troops during their occupation

There was no-one at their £220,000 semi-detached, three bedroom house today. A black Chevrolet Lacetti estate car was parked on the drive.

Last night a distraught family member, who asked not to be named, said: 'We are heartbroken. They were so in love and always together.'

Southampton Guide Dogs mobility team manager Tim Stafford said: 'We’re very sorry to learn of the sad death of Mr Scurr.

'He was a dedicated volunteer puppy walker, fundraiser and speaker. He 
was a great ambassador for Guide Dogs and will be missed by all who knew
him.

'Our thoughts are with his family.'

Mrs Scurr also regularly helped at St Patrick’s Church, in Southampton.

Father Claron Conde said: 'Lorraine is a very generous woman and very active, nothing is too much trouble for her.

'They loved to go walking and were always out enjoying the countryside.

'Lorraine is very involved in helping local disadvantaged children and is involved in the Sunday Liturgy.

'Her husband was a very nice man and we will be holding a memorial mass in the morning.

'Everyone is very shocked and devastated at what has happened. We have had messages of support pouring in all day.'
