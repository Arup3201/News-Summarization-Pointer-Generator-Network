The ice bucket challenge has been completed by some of the world's biggest names - but an average Joe from Derbyshire might have just done the most impressive one yet.

Jack Reynolds, from Hollinghead, near Chesterfield, is a whopping 102 years old - but was not fazed as he had the freezing bucket of water tipped over his head - while wearing nothing but Union Jack underpants.

The widower, who has four children, eight grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren, is believed to be the oldest person to complete the challenge, which raises money for ALS, also known as motor neurone disease.

Golden oldie: 102-year-old Jack Reynolds was not fazed by the bucket of freezing water poured over his head

Once he was done, he joked around by miming swimming underwater, before celebrating with a glass of his favourite whisky. 

'I'm game for a laugh, it was one of those things,' said the centenarian. 'It was cold but I had ten young ladies come to dry me out afterwards so I liked that.

'I've lived through two World Wars so a bucket of ice and water wouldn't phase me!

'I did it because of my family, they are fun-makers, they do all sorts of daft things and I have to be ready for anything.

'It was very chilly - in fact it was bloody cold, especially just in Union Jack boxer shorts.

'But some lovely women with a warm towel and a shot of Grouse whisky soon warmed me up!'

Mr Reynolds was nominated for the challenge by his ten-year-old great-granddaughter Shannon Spancer and a member of his Austrailian family, Julia Woollacott, 22. 

He did not hesitate to accept, and immediately gathered his family in his back garden to watch.

Grandson Shane Spencer, who filmed the event,  put the video on Facebook and it has already been shared more than 3,750 times.

'It's incredible, so many people have seen it,' said the 32-year-old, also from Chesterfield.

The Ice Bucket Challenge is the brainchild of former Division 1 baseball player Peter Frates, who was diagnosed with ALS in 2012.

It first took off in Boston, where the 29-year-old played, but has quickly spread all over the world, raising more than £48m for MND charities.

Partakers simply film themselves pouring a bucket of ice cold water over their heads and then share it on social media, nominating friends to do the same.

The forfeit is donating money to the foundation, though those that do take it on are also encouraged to donate. 

'He was definitely up for it, he is up for anything. He has done all sorts in the past. He is always game for a laugh, his age doesn't hold him back at all.

'As soon as he knew what it was he wanted to do it.

'He is on Facebook so he is very up-to-date with these things, he had been watching all his grandchildren and great grandchildren doing it.

'Straight away when the nomination came through he went into his room and came out in his Union Jack boxer shorts and said, "right, let's go".' 

After completing the challenge he nominated Carl Walters, his great grandson, and Carlene Walters, his great granddaughter, as well as Julia Woollacott's brother Rosko Dela Bosko.

Mr Reynolds' daughter Jayne said her father is a regular iPad and Facebook user, and was never going to shy away from the challenge.

'My dad is an amazing man. He went into the bedroom and just came out in a pair of Union Jack boxer shorts. Afterwards he just sat down and had a whisky, that's what keeps him going,' she said.

Despite his age, the daredevil centenarian still lives alone and continues to carry out all his household tasks apart from the gardening.

He said: 'My longevity is due to hard work and fresh air all my life, always being happy and smiling, a shot of Grouse whiskey in my tea first thing in a morning and a shot at night and especially through the care and joy my doting family brings me!'

Mr Reynolds worked at Staveley Coal and Iron Company for 40 years, before retiring 39 years ago in 1975. 

He will be making a donation to the Motor Neurone Disease Association, adding to the £48m already raise by the challenge in total.

More than 1.7m people have donated in less than a month, including Lady Gaga, David Beckham and George W. Bush.

The video of a man who took part in the ice bucket challenge just 20 minutes after his brother died from cancer has gone viral - being shared more than 3,000 times.

When grieving Alan Lucas, 56, stepped up to play his part, the usual slapstick comedy event instead became a poignant and emotionally charged tribute to the brother he had just lost.

Mr Lucas had only just learnt that his brother Paul had lost his fight against cancer.

Paul, a joiner from Slateford in Edinburgh, died aged 59, only eight weeks after being diagnosed.

Still reeling from the news of his loss, Alan opted to fulfil his part of the global challenge to raise money for cancer charity Macmillan.

He did the challenge alongside his wife Pam, and even found it in himself to slip on her swimsuit to add a bit of humour. 

'I didn't do it because I wanted any attention,' said Mr Lucas. 'I just wanted to give something back to Macmillan, whose nurses had helped Paul.

'Their nurses were there for the family and were amazing. This was a way of raising awareness of the great job they do.'

Construction workers complete extreme ice bucket challenge 

Construction workers have staged an ice bucket challenge by pouring water down a rubbish chute from the top of an 80ft building.

In one of the most ambitious challenges yet, a man in a high visibility jacket climbs into a skip at the bottom of the chute.

He is covered in ice cold water as it comes gushing out of the tube.

The stunt prompts plenty of laughter from his colleagues, with many of them filming it on their phones.

The footage at an unknown location, believed to be in England, has been posted on YouTube and is attracting much attention on social media websites.
