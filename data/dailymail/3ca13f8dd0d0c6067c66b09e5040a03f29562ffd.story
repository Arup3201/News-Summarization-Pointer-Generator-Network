A mother who abused her adopted son for more than a decade, beating him and locking him in darkness for a year, has today been jailed.

Jean Robinson beat her son Joseph for 11 years, after adopting him as an 18-month-old baby.

The 62-year-old locked him away without access to a toilet, caging him in total darkness for a year.

Robinson was today sentenced to 12 months in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of wilful assault at Preston Crown Court.

Speaking after the hearing, Joseph, now 27 and a dad himself, said: 'It started when I was adopted at 18 months old and went on until I was 11.

'She did awful things to me, and I used to wonder why she hated me so much.

'She’d lock me in my room with just a mattress on the floor.

'She’d take the lightbulb out of the light so I’d be in total darkness and there weren't any toilet facilities, so I’d have to go to the toilet in the room.

'Then she’d beat me for that. I used to cry into my pillow, wondering what I’d done to deserve it.'

The abuse took place over a 10-year period between 1988 and 1998.

Police officers investigating the case said the accounts were 'deeply moving'.

Detective Sergeant Jamie Lillystone, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a complicated and deeply moving case.

'The victim was a very young, vulnerable child who was systematically abused and neglected over a number of years by his adoptive mother.'
