A stunning portrait of a Parisian actress by Edouard Manet sold for $65 million at auction in New York on Wednesday, a record for a work by the French impressionist artist.

The painting entitled 'Spring' was sold at Christie's Wednesday evening for $65 million, almost doubling the previous record of $33.2 million for the French impressionist.

Spring is considered to be a Manet masterpiece and was first presented at the 1882 Paris Salon. It depicts actress Jeanne Demarsy in a floral dress and bonnet as an evocation of spring.

Artist: Édouard Manet, the French artist born in Paris France, is pictured here,

Manet had intended allegorical works of the four seasons but only completed Spring and Autumn. 

One of the leading artists of the impressionist movement, he was famous for his portraits and scenes from everyday life.

He died in 1883 at 51.

'Spring' has been in the same American collection for over a century and has been on loan at the National Gallery of Art for the last two decades.

The first owner was Manet's friend, the journalist Antonin Proust. 

It was later in the collections of the operatic baritone and important impressionist collector J.B Faure and French art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who sold it to a private collector in 1909, where it remained.

Christie's said Wednesday's sale brought in over $165 million. Prices included the buyer's premium.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, Christie's is featuring property of Academy Award-winning actress Joan Fontaine.

The price almost broke the $104.3 million record for the Swiss artist.
