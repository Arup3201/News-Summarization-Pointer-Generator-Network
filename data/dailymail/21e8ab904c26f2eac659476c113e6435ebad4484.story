It was a stunt so dangerous that it stunned even hardened traffic police officers.

North Yorkshire Police have released footage of biker Lukasz Wisniewski, 26, doing a wheelie at 103mph on the A63 near Selby in North Yorkshire.

Wisniewski, 26, of Firth Avenue, Leeds, was caught by a mobile safety camera as he pulled his motorbike onto its back wheel as he rode past a clearly visible police camera van.

The biker was doing 93mph when he 
began the highly dangerous manoeuvre but had accelerated to 103mph 
before he stopped, according to the police.

Today, a force spokeswoman confirmed 
Wisniewski appeared at Selby Magistrates’ Court last week where he 
admitted dangerous driving.

He was banned for 12 months and ordered 
to take an extended driving test. He was also given a community order 
which included 200 hours of unpaid work.

Inspector Dave Brown said: 'Wisniewski should be thankful that he is still here to face a ban and a community order.

Punishment: Wisniewski (pictured here in his bike gear) has been banned from driving for 12-months

'His riding showed complete disregard for his safety and that of other people.'

He added: 'The consequences of such irresponsible riding could have seen him facing far more serious offences.

'Riders and drivers need to bear in mind
the capability of the safety camera and its ability to capture 
indisputable evidence from all angles and at a greater distance than a 
conventional safety camera.

'We know the vast majority of riders are
sensible and use their machines safely and considerately.

'This message 
is aimed at the arrogant minority who show complete disregard for safety
and the potential life-changing consequences to their own and their 
families’ lives.'

Earlier this year reckless motorcyclist Peter Clarke led police on a terrifying eight-minute 156mph chase through traffic.

Clarke scraped through gaps between cars on his Suzuki motorcycle 
as he sped down the three-line carriageway in Cambridgeshire.

The motorcyclist - who eventually pulled over - insisted that he was an experienced rider and knew what he was doing.
