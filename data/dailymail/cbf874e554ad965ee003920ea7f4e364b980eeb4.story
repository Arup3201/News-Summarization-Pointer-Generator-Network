Chloe Brennan, 40, outside London's High Court. She is battling her late father's relatives, claiming she was the victim of a 'conspiracy' to cut her out of inheriting more than £500,000

A woman claims her father’s relatives conspired to cut her out of a £500,000 inheritance because she ‘shamed their family’ by being born out of wedlock.

Chloe Brennan says her father’s siblings ‘never liked her and didn’t want to know her’.

The mother of two claims her half-French father, Francoise Devillebichot, ‘treated her like a princess’ and promised she would never have to worry about money again after he died.

But when Mr Devillebichot died of throat cancer in 2011, aged 65, Mrs Brennan, 40, was shocked to find he had signed a will on his deathbed.

That left the bulk of his £620,000 estate – including his home in Harrow, north London, and a flat in Cannes – to his sisters Anne and Lucille, his brother  Phillippe and the children of a third sister, Jackie.

Mrs Brennan, who is her late father’s only child, wants the High Court to rule the will invalid and hand Mr Devillebichot’s entire fortune to her.

She told the court how her paternal grandfather, Georges Devillebichot, was a top French diplomat who lived in London and married an English girl, setting up home in Knightsbridge and raising their four children.

She said this auspicious upbringing led to her father’s siblings feeling ‘shame’ and ‘unfounded hostility’ when she was born illegitimate.

Mrs Brennan, of Reading, told Judge Mark Herbert QC she had to take a DNA test following her father’s death to ‘prove her heritage’.

In the will she was left £100,000. But Mrs Brennan insisted that on her wedding day her father promised her his worldly goods and she ‘fears the will is in fact a forgery’.

She claims Jackie and Anne, together with their cousins Anthony Prior and Andrew Prior – the executors of the estate – were ‘part of a conspiracy to fraudulently propound an invalid will’.

They deny those accusations, along with claims the siblings exerted ‘undue influence’ on their dying brother to get him to make the will.

Mrs Brennan told the court: ‘I contend that the siblings took advantage of my father’s admission to hospital and indisposition by making and arranging the will.

‘If he did sign the will, he was 
compelled to sign any document put before him, without ever knowing the 
full and real contents of it or its implications.

‘The circumstances around the making 
of the will raise suspicion. It was made when my father was admitted to 
hospital and the siblings were told he had seven days to live. I wasn’t 
contacted. The next day he signed the will, effectively excluding his 
only daughter, directly contrary to previous discussions with me.

Ms Brennan's cousins Anthony Prior - a magistrate and executor of the will - and Andrew Prior outside London's High Court. She accuses the pair of taking part in the conspiracy against her

‘I believe that there is a suspicion or doubt that this will was invalid and hope the court will reach the same conclusion.’

Luke Harris, representing Mr Devillebichot’s siblings, said the way the will divided the assets was ‘perfectly understandable’.

He added the £100,000 gift to Mrs 
Brennan, far from being shocking, ‘reflected his favourable treatment of
his daughter during his life’.

Cross-examining Mrs Brennan, he said: ‘He was getting tired of giving you money.’

Mr Harris told the court: ‘The will is
rational on its face. The evidential burden is upon Mrs Brennan to 
raise a real doubt about capacity. It is submitted that she has clearly 
failed to discharge that burden.

‘There is certainly no evidence that 
raises even a prima facie case that the Priors, Anne and Jackie have 
forged or falsely propounded the will or conspired to commit forgery.

‘The Priors are both respectable 
members of society. It is inherently unlikely that two such individuals 
would come to court to lie.’

The hearing continues.
