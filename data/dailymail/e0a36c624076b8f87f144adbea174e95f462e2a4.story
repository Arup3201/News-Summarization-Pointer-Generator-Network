Mystery: Police are investigating if student Thomas Healy, 19, was hit by a car, fell or jumped to his death

A father has told of his devastation after finding the dead body of his missing son slumped under a motorway bridge.

Mystery surrounds the death of University student Thomas Healy, 19, who disappeared during a night out with friends.

His family launched a frantic search when he failed to make contact after getting out of a minibus which stopped on the hard shoulder of the M6.

Father John, 48, who had been scouring the area with Thomas’ brother Kevin, when he made the horrifying discovery.

He said: ‘As we walked I could see a figure in the distance and said, “that’s our Tom”.

‘I just sat with my son, holding him. He was the best son you could have had.

‘I haven’t just lost a son, but my best mate, too.’

The second year of a geography degree at Loughborough University, was found on the stretch of road in Erdington, on Saturday afternoon.

Police are treating the death as unexplained and are investigating whether he fell or jumped.

The former grammar school pupil had last been seen walking on the hard shoulder on the elevated section of the northbound M6, between junction five and six, just after midnight earlier that day.

It is believed he had been travelling in a minibus with friends on his way into Birmingham, but got out after the bus stopped on the hard shoulder for unknown reasons at about 11.45pm.

Worried friends later phoned his parents - John and June Healy - to find out if he had got home safely.

Mr Healy said he knew something was wrong and so went to look for Thomas.

Mr Healy, a London Midland train driver, said: ‘He would usually text to say he was stopping with his mates, but he hadn’t got in touch.

‘We panicked because he was a 
responsible kid so something wasn’t right. I phoned my brother, Kevin, 
and asked him to come and look in the area where they said Tom had got 
out.

‘If he did get hit or jumped, it wasn’t something I wanted to know, but it was something I had to eliminate.

A post mortem is due to take place to establish the cause of death.

‘He
was the best son you could have had. I haven’t just lost a son, but my 
best mate, too,’ said Mr Healy, whose 52-year-old wife, a London Midland
revenue inspector, was too distraught to speak.

Aston Villa fan Thomas, a former pupil at Kingstanding’s Twickenham Primary School, was the youngest of three, including sister Carla, 27, and brother Steven, 26.

‘All the neighbours have come out to see us - they’re all in shock, too. They loved him. Just the weekend before he was out helping one of our neighbours fix his fence,’ added Mr Healy.

‘He didn’t know what he wanted to do with his degree after university. But we were very proud of him - he was the first in the family to go to university.’

West Midlands Police Acting Inspector Tex Bate appealed for anybody who may have seen Thomas on the motorway to get in touch.
