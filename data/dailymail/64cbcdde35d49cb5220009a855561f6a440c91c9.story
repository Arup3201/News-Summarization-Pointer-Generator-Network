The killer of five-year-old April Jones has been scarred for life in an attack by a fellow prisoner.

Mark Bridger was slashed across the face with a razor blade at the maximum security prison where he is serving a whole-life term for the horrific murder.

The 47-year-old was taken to hospital for stitches on Sunday and returned to HMP Wakefield a few hours later.

Bridger abducted April, who had cerebral palsy, while she was playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Mid-Wales, last October.

He sexually abused her, killed her and then dismembered and disposed of her body.

The former abattoir worker has refused
to reveal what he did with April’s remains and claimed during his trial
she died in a car accident.

Police believe he dumped her body 
parts in the hills, rivers and forests surrounding his remote home in 
Ceinws. Traces of her blood and skull fragments were found at his rented
cottage.

Yesterday Machynlleth villagers 
applauded the prisoner who attacked April’s killer and appealed to 
Bridger to reveal what he did with her body to make his own life behind 
bars easier. Julie Williams, a mother-of-two, said: ‘No one has any 
sympathy for him.

‘He is so evil for not saying where 
her body is. Other prisoners may lay off him if he lets the authorities 
know what he did with April.

‘It’s the least he should do – this 
attack may frighten him into doing the right thing. But it won’t bring 
April back to her family.’

Bridger was reportedly slashed in the face as he walked along a gangway at HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire

Bridger, who has six children by four 
women, was attacked as he walked along a gangway and is badly scarred, 
according to reports. Friends of April’s family said they had no 
sympathy.

‘Was he expecting an easy ride in prison? He doesn’t deserve any sympathy after what he did,’ said Alexander Darracott.

Carole Davies said: ‘Hopefully he will
live in fear for his life every day. Imagine little April’s fear and 
terror.’ And councillor Michael Williams said: ‘His crimes were 
horrendous to say the least and this will come as a wake-up call to him 
about just how he is seen by the rest of the country.’

Bridger was recently transferred to 
HMP Wakefield, the largest maximum security jail in the country, which 
houses a number of child killers including Roy Whiting, Levi Bellfield 
and Mick Philpott.

Despite tight security – including 
segregation for paedophiles and child killers – attacks with makeshift 
blades and other improvised weapons are not uncommon.

Bridger was given a whole-life 
sentence in May by trial judge Mr Justice Griffiths Williams after a 
jury found him guilty of murder at Mold Crown Court.
