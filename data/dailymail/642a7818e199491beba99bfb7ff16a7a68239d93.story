When Michelle, now 46, from North Wales, met her husband John in 1993, she was instantly smitten.

The divorced single mother of three small children, she says their whirlwind romance and marriage a year later in 1994 was like 'a dream come true'.

But 20 years on and her dream had turned into a nightmare, when John ran off with her daughter-in-law, Liz.

Distraught: Michelle was left furious when her husband of 20 years ran off with their daughter-in-law

Now Michelle says she will never forgive the man she once called husband - and says she is even more furious because of the hurt he caused to her son, also called John.

Michelle's story began in 1993 when she was going through a divorce from her first husband. A chance meeting in a shop led to love and she was soon smitten.

'There was an immediate spark between us,' she remembers. 'He had what I thought were kind eyes. He was young, attractive, made me laugh.

'I just felt so comfortable with him. I felt like I could trust him. I was wary about introducing him to the kids but they just really got on. It was nice to be around each other.'

Months after meeting, John moved in with Michelle and her three children and yes than a year later, the couple married in what Michelle describes as a 'fairytale' wedding.

'It was all I imagined a proper wedding would be,' she says.

Michelle's three children, all of whom were adopted by her new husband, were equally delighted, with John proving a kind and caring stepfather. 

'He was the only dad that I knew,' explains Michelle's eldest son John. 'I was quite close to him. We used to go out and play football and do things as a family.'

Unsuspecting: John and Michelle had always been happy but that changed when Liz came on the scene

'We just got on with life, enjoyed what we had and watched the kids grow up,' adds Michelle. 'I think we did good job with the kids.'

But all that changed when John Jr, then aged 20, met Liz, a single mother of two who he would go on to marry.

Determined to provide for his new family, John Jr enrolled on a osteopathy course at Surrey University, planning to sell his home in Wales and bring his family to live with him in England.

The move was to have fateful consequences. 'I moved down there, put the house up for sale, and was waiting for it to sell before she and the kids moved in,' he explains. 'It did put a strain on our relationship.'

Meanwhile, Michelle and husband John had also been having problems and as Michelle puts it, the couple 'weren't happy together any more'.

She had also begun to suspect that the relationship between her husband and daughter-in-law wasn't as innocent as it seemed. 

Betrayed: Michelle with her husband John, son John Jr and daughter-in-law Liz at John Jr's wedding

On Shrove Tuesday 2013, her suspicions were fuelled by an episode at her home in which the pair indulged in a play fight, squirting cream at each other and 'slipping and sliding all over the floor'. 

'It didn't look right,' says Michelle. 'It looked like they were flirting. They never acted like that before. They'd never behaved like that. They didn't even really get on. It just looked like a new relationship.'

Horrified, she decided to take a closer look at the phone bill and soon discovered that one number, Liz's, kept popping up. 

'I questioned my husband about it and asked him why there were all these phonecalls and what was going on between him and Liz,' she recalls.

'He laughed and said I was mad. I rang my son and told him to come home.'

John Jr, however, didn't share his mother's suspicions. 'I didn't believe for one second that there was something going on,' he says.

'I stuck up for my ex and my dad. I was perfectly fine with those two meeting up and talking.'

Matters between John Sr and Michelle continued to deteriorate, with the couple leading increasingly separate lives. Eventually, she asked him to leave and John Jr stepped in to offer his father a place to stay. 

'I said he could come and stay at ours,' he explains. 'He said he didn't want to come in case he put a strain on our relationship. I insisted.'

Furious: Michelle says the worst part has been the pain John Jr has been put through

The decision to allow his father to stay was to prove deadly for his marriage. A few weeks after John Sr moved in with Liz and John Jr, he got a text from his wife saying the marriage was over.

 'I got a message off Liz basically saying, "Me and your dad are seeing each other, we've talked about it and me and you are no longer together. We're going to make a go of a relationship".

'About 10 minutes later, I got a message off my dad saying. "I've heard Liz has told you that we're seeing each other. Nothing happened beforehand - it only just happened now".'

Beside himself, John Jr phoned his mother, who was equally distraught. 'It was horrible,' she says. 'I couldn't believe he would do that. 

'It was hard to believe that the guy I lived with for 20 years could do something so nasty and then come out with comments like, '"We're doing nothing wrong" and "He's not my son".'

15 months on, Liz and John Sr are still together and although Michelle is finally moving on from what happened, John Jr is still reeling. 

'I lost my wife, my dad, the kids and my house,' he says. 'The whole lot. I have nothing else.'

Michelle, meanwhile, remains angry about how her son was treated. 'It really killed me that he'd done that to my son,' she says. 'I find it really hard that my son suffered so much.

'I never thought he would do this to us or hurt us both so much.'
