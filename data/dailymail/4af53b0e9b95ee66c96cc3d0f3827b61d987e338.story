The White House has disowned a State Department draft proposal that would have seen Ebola-infected foreign nationals brought to the United States for treatment.

'No,' National Security Council Assistant Press Secretary Ned Price said flatly on Wednesday evening when MailOnline asked if the plan was under consideration.

'There are absolutely no plans to MEDEVAC non-Americans who become ill with Ebola to the United States,' said Price. 'We have discussed allowing other countries to use our MEDEVAC capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third-countries, subject to reimbursement and availability. But we are not contemplating bringing them back to the U.S. for treatment.'

'Allegations to the contrary are completely false.' 

The four-page draft proposal, which surfaced Wednesday morning, 'was drafted by a mid-level official,' Price added, 'but not cleared by senior leaders. It never came to senior officials for approval.' 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT MEMO

Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte claimed on Monday night that the Obama administration was plotting to bring foreign nationals with Ebola into the U.S. for treatment – and he appeared at first to be correct

DISMISSED: White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday that it 'certainly hasn't happened so far; I don't know of any plans to do that'

The plainly worded position paper described its goal as reaching 'an agreed State Department position on the extent to which non-U.S. citizens will be admitted to the United States for treatment of Ebola Virus Disease.'

'The United States needs to show leadership and act as we are asking others to act by admitting certain non-citizens into the country for medical treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) during the Ebola crisis,' the memo read.

It spelled out the expected cost at $500,000 per patient, including $300,000 for medical treatment and $200,000 for transportation.

The  memo also said the U.S. is considering a change in policy because some countries 'are implicitly or explicitly waiting for medevac assurances' as a condition of sending their own doctors and nurses into the Ebola hot zone – particularly countries that lack their own capacity to treat Ebola patients.

Despite the existence of a written plan, the State Department had already denie that it had any intention of bringing Ebola-infected noncitizens to the U.S. for treatment.

One official told The Washington Times that 'there is no policy of the U.S. government to allow entry of non-U.S. citizen Ebola-infected to the United States. There is no consideration in the State Department of changing that policy.' 

Robert Sorenson, deputy director of the State Department's Office of International Health and Biodefense, wrote the memo, which advocates strongly for a policy that would allow the life-flights.

State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday that the draft is 'weeks old' and out of date because 'our European partners, since several weeks ago when that was written, have addressed this by providing a guarantee to international health workers that they would either be flown to Europe or receive high-quality treatment on the spot.'

'So it’s not applicable at this point.' 

Virginia Republican congressman Bob Goodlatte claimed on Monday that the government was working on such a scheme, saying that was 'increasing evidence that they're making those plans.' but the Obama administration offered a qualified denial on Tuesday.

'That certainly hasn't happened so far,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday. 'I don't know of any plans to do that.'

Goodlatte's aides at the House Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, wouldn't discuss details.

A committee aide told MailOnline only that a government official 'contacted our office about this proposed plan and Chairman Goodlatte has written to Secretaries Kerry and Johnson seeking information about it.'

The congressman's October 21 letter demanded written records related to 'a plan to allow non-U.S. citizens infected with Ebola to enter the U.S. to receive medical treatment.'

Goodlatte told Fox News host Megyn Kelly that while non-citizen Ebola sufferers could be brought to the U.S. on the same kind of aircraft that have already transported nine Americans to Emory University Hospital and other treatment facilities, the risk of exposing Americansis too great.

'The disease needs to be contained where it is now, and people treated there,' he said.

The congressman is a strong advocate for a travel ban that would restrict the ability of people to reach the U.S. from western Africa without a pre-travel quarantine, calling it 'simply a matter of common sense.'

And 'if you are concerned about this problem spreading,' he said, 'and this is a deadly disease that we're even concerned about the great health care workers when they come back, not spreading it – we certainly shouldn't be bringing in the patients.'

Judicial Watch, a center-right watchdog group, first raised the specter of Ebola life-flights that could bring the disease into the interior of the United States without involving a U.S. citizen.

The organization's first online mention of the idea predated Goodlatte's letter by four days.

One day after Goodlatte weighed in with State and DHS, Judicial Watch proposed a scenario where importing non-American Ebola cases for treatment could be legal – by offering Ebola-infected foreign nationals 'a special parole.'

'Under federal regulations a parolee is an alien that is inadmissible to the inspecting officer but is allowed into the United States for urgent humanitarian reasons,' the group explained in a statement. 

'Obama applied this exemption to allow the recent influx of illegal immigrant minors that entered the country through the Mexican border by labeling it a “humanitarian crisis".'

'Besides “urgent humanitarian reasons,” parole can be authorized at DHS headquarters for “medical emergency,” according to the agency’s regulations. This could apply to foreign nationals infected with Ebola.'
