It's one of the most popular budget store's on the high street, famed for its fashion-forward designs at bargain prices.

But trawling through Primark and fending off other customers for cut-price goods isn't exactly everyone's idea of a fun afternoon of shopping - and the store has never added to its real-life success with a virtual shop.

So when e-tailer ASOS announced it would be selling the discount store's clothing on its website, the penny pinching members of the fashion world rejoiced.

So much so that following 'phenomenal' demand for Primark products after just one week on sale, the site will now double the number of products on its website.

Roaring success: ASOS reported a huge sales surge following its new partnership with Primark and will now double the number of products on its website (L) Floral skater dress £13 (R) Midi skirt £8

The number will increase from 70 to 
approximately 140 items over the next few weeks, although the 
collaboration still remains a trial for the time being.

'It's a great product,' said ASOS CEO Nick Robertson.

'It's very conveniently priced and our customers like it a lot. If you join these things up, you can deduce that it's selling quite well.'

Bestsellers included cropped tops, 
metallic and white fabrics and Seventies styles including maxi dresses 
and wide-legged trousers.

The site's new collaboration with Primark is the latest in a string of successes for ASOS.

While most of Britain's traditional high street shops 
have suffered as consumers feel the pinch, ASOS's performance suggests online retailers may be faring far better - 
though the strongest growth came from markets abroad including the U.S. 
and Australia.

ASOS reported a remarkable 45 per cent
rise in sales to £194m in the past three months just 
before the Primark trial began - compared with the same period in 2012, 
helped by price reductions on own-brand products which boosted demand.

It was also helped in the UK by the coldest spring in 50 years, which discouraged shoppers from leaving their homes.

ASOS has tapped into demand from value-seeking twenty-somethings for both branded and own-label products. The company - whose name stands for 'as 
seen on screen' - particularly targets young women aiming to emulate the
designer looks of celebrities such as Nicole Scherzinger and Cara 
Delevingne.

Looking good: Having begun a limited
trial of Primark fashion items last week - marking the clothing chain's
first foray online - business has rocketed through the ASOS site

And while UK sales jumped 39 per cent to £64million, international sales were up a mighty 48 per cent to £129million - driven by stronger growth in countries where it has dedicated websites such as the United States, France, Germany and Australia.

It means the company now makes 67 per cent of retail sales overseas, and it has unveiled plans to build on this success with the launch of a Chinese-language website in October.
