A 35-year-old divorcee enlisted her family and friends to help her ravage and eventually destroy her beautiful bridal gown over the course of seven months before she ceremoniously torched it in a bonfire.

After splitting from her husband of eight years in 2014, Dayna Rumfelt, from Wasilla, Alaska, knew she didn't want her wedding dress hanging in her closet for the rest of her life. Her desire to rid herself of the memory-filled garment prompted her to devise Operation Destroy The Dress, a detailed plan which would enable Ms Rumfelt to wreak havoc on her gown by dragging it through the mud and donning it for a day of paintball shooting, among other things.

'It felt so freeing,' she told The Huffington Post. 'For a long time after my divorce, I felt like I had a monkey on my back dragging me down into the mud.'

Finally over: Operation Destroy The Dress ended when she set her gown ablaze in a backyard bonfire

She continued: 'When the dress adventure began, I started to feel that less and less.'

Ms Rumfelt's adventure began when she was photographed modeling her white gown at the Rage City Rollergirls roller derby game, where she coached the skaters from the sidelines as a bench manager, all the while clad in her fancy frock.

Her friend Spenard Itch, who was also helping from the sidelines, wore a suit so she could match Ms Rumfelt's bridal attire.

Next Ms Rumfelt and her friend Laura Burns, who was also going through a divorce, wore their dresses as they jumped into Reed Lakes.

Surprisingly, the murky lake water didn't affect her dresses appearance in anyway.

'It's funny how when you're getting married your wedding dress seems so fragile, but really when it comes down to it, those suckers are tough as nails,' she said.

According to Ms Rumfelt, her dress was still in fine condition after it dried - albeit a bit smelly. 

Just when she was really about to get started, Ms Rumfelt was approached by  photographer Kathy Shifflett who asked if she wanted to star in her own trash the dress photoshoot.

One captivating images shows her donning the dreaded dress after it was covered in mud, but even the dirt deposits didn't ruin its appearance.

In fact, most of the mud washed out when she threw it in the washing machine. 

While Ms Rumfelt contemplated even more daring adventures with her gown, including ski diving, she got preoccupied with work and realized that she just wanted the dress out of her life once and for all. 

Her wedding gown met its final demise at a backyard bonfire - with the moment being captured by photographer Greg A Morgan.

Ms Rumfelt said setting her dress ablaze gave her a huge 'sense of relief'. 

'The dress just had to go,' she said.

Trash the dress photoshoots are gaining popularity with both jilted brides and happily married women, who want to give their gowns new life by destroying them. 

Last December, 23-year-old Shelby Swink, from Memphis, Tennessee, covered her bridal dress in paint and glitter after her boyfriend of four years called off their wedding just days before they planned on saying 'I do'.

Meanwhile, the bridal photography trend has prompted many newlyweds to pose in mud, under water and covered in paint - ultimately destroying their gowns - for the sake of capturing the perfect picture.
