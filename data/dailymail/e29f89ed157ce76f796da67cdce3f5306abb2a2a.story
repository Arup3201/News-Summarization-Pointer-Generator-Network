Applying liquid eyeliner is a notoriously tricky skill that only the most die-hard fantatics seem to have acquired.

But a new product from Benefit promises to make a freehand straight line quite literally fool-proof.

The They're Real! Push-Up Liner boasts an italicized wand, the tip of which hugs the lash line, keeping the user on track. The design is patent-pending and claims to make application 'beyond easy.'

Fool-proof? Benefit's They're Real! Push-Up Liner boasts an italicized wand, the tip of which is designed to hug the lash line, keeping the user on track

And the hype is already in effect. Though the $24 (£18.50) liner doesn't hit stores until June 27, Benefit says it already has a 35,000-strong wait list.

Already a liquid eyeliner fan, I usually do a series of small dashes from inner eye to outer eye to achieve an even line, mistakes concealed by a lick of smudgy kohl on top. But could Benefit help me get that perfect 1950s flick?

I decided to test it under three of my most typical make-up application conditions: in front of a well-lit mirror at home; using a tiny compact mirror at my desk; and in a moving vehicle en-route to an event.

First attempt: The eyeliner tip stayed close to the lash roots, making for a neat-ish line

AT HOME WITH A WELL-LIT MIRROR

This first test scenario allowed me to get to grips with the novel tip shape and eyeliner texture. Instead of a liquid, like most products on the market, it is more of a paste, dispensed by a single twist of the base.

I pointed the rubber tip at my lashline, and sure enough, it stayed in place, making for a neat-ish line in a sharp, matte black. Impressive. I then dabbed the tip into the lash line to fill in spaces where the ink wasn't quite close enough to the roots. 

AT WORK WITH A HAND MIRROR

Next up was using a hand mirror at my desk - I'm often applying make-up in a rush pre-meeting. This time, confidence boosted, I attempted a flick. Using the wand like a Sharpie, I drew a triangle shape at the outer edge, then dragged the tip along the lashline as usual, filling in the space between the two at the end. This attempt was still a little shaky - eyelids not being completely even canvases - but it was easier than the first. I guess practice makes perfect, even with a fool-proof liner.

Second attempt: This time a Fifties-style flick was attempted. It was relatively easy, even using a tiny hand mirror, but practice makes perfect, even with a fool-proof liner

Do not attempt on cobblestones: Applying eyeliner in the back of a taxi is a risky business

IN THE BACK OF A MOVING TAXI

I was dreading applying eyeliner in a moving vehicle. As my taxi pulled away down a cobbled street, I wondered if this would end in serious injury. On a smooth road, however, it seemed more feasible - despite the low light. A single, freehand line was not possible with the jerky stop-start movements of the car, so I resorted to my tried and true technique of dashes, and ended up with a just-about-acceptable result.

THE PROS: The eyeliner DOES hug the lashline, making a straight line easier to achieve. It has a lovely inky, matte finish (some eyeliners can be a bit chalky), and it truly doesn't budge once it's on.

THE CONS: It doesn't budge. I looked like a raccoon when I tried to take it off. An oil-based make-up remover seemed to do the trick. A couple of colleagues who also tried the liner weren't comfortable with the italicized tip or paste-like texture, preferring their traditional liquid liners instead.

THE EXPERT'S VERDICT: Celebrity make-up artist Rachel Wood, whose clients include Mariah Carey and Louise Roe, was immediately impressed by the They're Real! Push-Up Liner.

'This is great, because it's like a Sharpie for your eye,' she said. 'This felt tip pen has a nice angled sharp edge. And it stays really nice and black.

'Once it's dry, it really doesn't move,' she added. 'It's a really fantastic product.'

Benefit They're Real! Push-Up Liner goes on sale on June 27th in the U.S. and June 28th in the UK. The Benefit boutique in Carnaby Street, London, will be stocking it early, from Thursday 26th June.
