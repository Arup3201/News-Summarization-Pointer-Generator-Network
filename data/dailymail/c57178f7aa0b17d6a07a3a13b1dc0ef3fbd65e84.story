When their grumpy teenager is in the throes of yet another sulking fit, most parents would give an awful lot to know what’s going on inside their head.

And soon they’ll be able to – without resorting to a guilty peek in their diary.

Scientists at Cambridge University have begun a £5.4million study to understand the workings of the teenage brain.

Adolescent moods - personified by Harry Enfield's Kevin the Teenager (pictured) - will be studied by scientists

They will scan the brains of 300 participants, currently aged 14 to 24, over several years to see how they change as they grow older.

Teenagers are typically impulsive, argumentative and sullen – as personified by Harry Enfield’s teenager Kevin, whose catchphrase is ‘it’s so unfair’.

Ed Bullmore, a professor of psychiatry at Cambridge University, believes that the wiring of the brain gradually changes as teenagers approach adulthood, which eventually allows them to control their emotions and act less impulsively.

‘MRI scans will give us very good pictures of how the anatomy of the brain changes over the course of development,’ he told the BBC. ‘We are particularly interested in how the tissue at the centre of the brain, known as white matter, might change over the course of development.’

Professor Bullmore believes that changes to the white matter, the communication cables between brain cells, increase the mind’s ability to think ahead.

He explained that changes to the brain’s wiring will be related to emotional, behavioural and cognitive changes.

These will be measured separately through tests which assess impulsive and risk-taking behaviour. Professor Bullmore said: ‘I think we are going to find that the decision-making process in the younger teenagers [is] more driven by short-term considerations, immediate emotional states, immediate past history of what was rewarding.’

One of the first to undergo the MRI scan was a 16-year-old who suffered from mood changes.

The girl, known only as Samantha, said: ‘When I was about 15 or 16, that’s when I noticed the change the biggest.

‘Instead of being happy all the time I would be quite moody, angry, and I would have arguments. I just changed completely.’

Becky Inkster, a neuroscientist and project manager at Cambridge University, said: ‘Arguably we’ve all been there and it’s a very awkward and complex and confusing time of life. So to be able to express oneself is quite difficult.

‘So by the use of imaging and other tools we can really tap into these features of the adolescent brain and understand how they develop over time as they become a young adult.’

The study, funded by the Wellcome Trust, may also enable doctors to identify individuals at high risk of developing a psychiatric or drug dependence disorder.

Professor Bullmore explained: ‘A lot of mental illness arises for the first time in adolescence or young adults and we think it’s often arising from an abnormal development of these kinds of brain networks.’
