A British couple whose baby girl was seized by police during a holiday in Portugal have furiously denied being too drunk to look after her.

James Moreland and Lee-Ann O’Donoghue said they had been handcuffed by police with guns, who told them their heavy-handed response was because of the ‘Madeleine McCann effect’.

The couple’s 14-month-old daughter, who we have been asked not to name, was taken into emergency care on Sunday after reports they had drunkenly thrown her into a pool and staggered around with her on an eighth-floor hotel balcony.

Miss O’Donoghue and Mr Moreland, on their first family holiday together since the baby’s birth, said they were at a loss as to why their daughter was placed in a hospital, and branded reports of their antics as ‘ludicrous, downright lies’.

They also claim Mr Moreland, 29, was beaten by police and £500 – all of their holiday spending money – was stolen during the assault.

Miss O’Donoghue, 34, who is on maternity leave from her job as a hospital personal assistant, said: ‘We are so scared and shaken up.

‘The police told us they had acted like they did, that they had been heavy-handed, because of the Madeleine McCann effect. They said the case had been very bad for them and that they had to be very careful when it came to the welfare of British children on holiday.’

The family were staying at the Hotel Paraiso in Albufeira – 40 miles from Praia da Luz where Madeleine vanished in 2007 – as part of a week-long Thomas Cook package trip.

Their story first emerged in the Portuguese press, which quoted unnamed hotel guests as saying that while sat by the pool, they had seen Miss O’Donoghue on the balcony behaving dangerously.

The reports also said the daughter had bruised legs after her mother dropped her and that a drunken Mr Moreland hurled her into the pool in front of horrified holidaymakers.

But both parents vehemently deny any of this took place – especially as their room, which they showed to the Mail, does not overlook the hotel pool but a car park, from where Miss O’Donoghue could not possibly have been seen.

Looking drained, she said: ‘You can see from my daughter’s legs there are no bruises. I did not drop her, I have never dropped her and I was not drunk.

‘She is my first and only baby and I adore her. I am such a protective mother. I just can’t believe the lies I am hearing.’ Mr Moreland, who is covered in bruises he says were inflicted by the police, said: ‘To say I threw my daughter in the pool is just ridiculous.’

Their ordeal began on Sunday afternoon when they joined friends at a bar in Albufeira. Miss O’Donoghue said: ‘I had three cocktails and was merry, not drunk by any stretch.’ At 8pm, after they returned to the hotel, police knocked on the door.

‘They said they wanted to check on the baby,’ said Miss O’Donoghue. ‘My daughter was crying because she is teething so I gave her some Calpol (a brand of paracetamol for children).

‘The police saw the bottle and said that it was an “illegal drug in Portugal” and  they were taking her to hospital for tests to see if we had sedated her. They were very brusque and had guns.’

Miss O’Donoghue was allowed to go to the hospital too. But when medics ‘started sticking needles’ in her baby for drug tests, she protested and was handcuffed. Soon afterwards, Mr Moreland arrived at the hospital but was refused entry.

He claimed: ‘I did get angry and started to shout and swear as I wanted to see my baby. A group of about seven policemen started hitting me, they put me in handcuffs and threw me on the floor in the back of a police car.

‘They yanked my arms up behind me until I screamed. They checked my wallet for ID and when I got home I saw that all of our spending money had gone.’

The couple, from Belfast, were not arrested but the case was referred to the local equivalent of social services.

They were finally given their baby back on Tuesday.

A Portuguese police spokesman said: ‘We were called to the hotel because of reports of a drunk and disorderly disturbance.’
