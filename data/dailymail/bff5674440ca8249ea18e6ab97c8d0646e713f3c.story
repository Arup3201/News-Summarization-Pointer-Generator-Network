Jibe: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls used his keynote speech on the economy to crack a joke about David Cameron's holiday snaps

Politics is often portrayed as an exercise in proving who is the alpha male who stands out from the crowd.

But Ed Balls took the battle to a new level today when he appeared to tease David Cameron about only needing a small towel to preserve his modesty on the beach.

The shadow chancellor was greeted with nervous laughter and bemused stares of incomprehension from delegates at the Labour party conference.

The Prime Minister was snapped on a Cornish beach last month performing the time-honoured dancing of trying to change out of his trunks while maintaining a degree of decency and dignity.

Having deftly completed the tricky manoeuvre, Mr Cameron then went on to remove his trusty polo shirt to reveal an ample - and very red - torso.

Delivering his keynote speech on Labour's economy strategy, Mr Balls today took a detour to cast judgement on the PM's physique.

Even wife Yvette Cooper, sitting in the audience, appeared taken aback, managing only a thin-lipped smile throughout.

The shadow chancellor was met with 
cries of 'no' after asking the Labour Party conference if anyone felt 
sorry for Mr Cameron when he was pictured putting his shorts on under 
his Mickey Mouse towel.

Mr 
Balls revealed his wife had remarked that the PM looked slim for a 
46-year-old, leading the shadow chancellor to question who she was 
comparing him to.Scroll down for video

The Labour heavyweight could be accused of pushing his luck, given that only yesterday pictures of him taking a tumble during a football match suggested he is not too light on his feet himself.

Mr Balls joked during his speech at the Brighton conference: 'Didn't you feel a little sorry for our Prime Minister this summer? Didn't you?

'Back in August, on the beach, changing into his swimming trunks, behind that Mickey Mouse towel, captured on cameras, unflattering pictures spread across the national press.

'I've been there, I know what it's like.'

Mr Balls went on: 'Let me let you into a little secret. When Yvette saw the pictures she said, rather pointedly I thought, she said that for a 46-year old man David Cameron looked rather slim.

'Slim? Who on Earth can she have been comparing him to?

'I just thought for a Prime Minister it was a surprisingly small towel.

'Let us all agree after the last three years the sooner David Cameron throws in the towel the better.'

Life's a beach: In the latest photo opportunity Ed and Justine Miliband were pictured on Brighton beach apparently reading his leader's speech

Ed Miliband copied David Cameron to be pictured on the beach - but kept his trousers on.

The Labour leader posed on the pebbles on Brighton beach with wife Justine, in just the latest photo opportunity for the couple.

Justine Miliband has promised to take to 
the ‘barricades’ in the general election battle as she vowed not to just
stand silently next to husband Ed in a nice dress.

Party strategists plan to put Mrs Miliband on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election.

But she has vowed to break with convention and speak out publicly about why she thinks Mr Miliband should be Prime Minister.

Speaking at a Young Labour event in 
Brighton, she said: ‘I wanted to come along to say a few words because I
thought, “If I don't say anything to you guys tonight probably all 
you'll know about me this year is the make of the dress I wear for Ed's 
speech on Tuesday”.

‘That's a
side of me the media tend to focus on and I thought it was quite 
important to reassure you that I am in fact more than a dress.’
