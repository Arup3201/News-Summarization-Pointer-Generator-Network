Staff at Paignton Zoo have filmed the moment an endangered Rothschild's Giraffe gave birth.

The baby girl was born at the Devon zoo on Saturday afternoon, and already stands more than six foot tall and was on her feet within hours.

Mother Sangha gave birth during the day which is unusual for a giraffe, but also allowed her keepers to record it.

Unusually mother Sangha gave birth during the day which allowed zookeepers to film it

The girl's father is 10-year-old Yoda, who arrived in Devon from Givskud Zoo, Denmark in September 2006, while mother Sangha came from Liberec Zoo in Slovakia.

The gestation period for the species is between 14 and 16 months, after which they give birth standing up in order to break the umbilical chord.

The breeding pair did produce one other calf, a male, which was born in August last year but died shortly afterwards.

The zoo’s other female is Janica, who came from Duvr Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic.

The birth is important as Rothschild's Giraffe are the most endangered of all the giraffe species

Janica gave birth to Valentino in February 2012, while Otilie was born to Sangha in September 2012.

The zoo’s giraffes are all Rothschild’s Giraffe, which are classified as Endangered.

The species is named after Lord Walter Rothschild who discovered them in east Africa in the early 1900s.

Sangha and her breeding partner Yoda had another calf, a male, in August last year but it died shortly after birth

They used to be common across Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, but now they are the most endangered of all giraffe species.

With just 670 left in the wild, it makes them rarer than Giant Pandas, of which there are thought to be 1,600 left.

There are thought to be about 450 in captivity, and efforts in 2011 to re-introduce individuals back into the Lake Baringo area in Kenya have proved successful.

There are only 670 Rothschild's giraffes in the wild, making them rarer than Giant Pandas

Very little is known about why the Rothschild's Giraffe - named after Lord Walter Rothschild - is so endangered.

Poaching, loss of habitat and increased contact with humans have all been put forward as theories to explain their gradual disappearance.

Giraffe are relatively easy to kill as they will often stare intently at a target before running, aming them easy to shoot. Their long legs are also easily tangled in traps and one fall can be enough to break their necks.

For the amount of effort required to kill, they have a large amount of meat and could therefore be targets for bush meat poachers.

Their skins are also prized for use on clothing, their mane can be woven into bracelets, their tails are used to convey authority and their leg tendons can be used as guitar strings.

Like most endangered species their body parts are also commonly used in tribal medicine.

There are as few as 670 left in the wild, making them rarer than Giant Pandas, with another 450 believed to be in captivity.
