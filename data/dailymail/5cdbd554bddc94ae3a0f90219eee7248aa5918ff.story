The Argentinian temptress who won former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford's heart and cost him the possibility of being the 2012 Republican presidential nominee has opened up about their affair.

Maria Belen Chapur, who Sanford flew to Buenos Aires to be with after mysteriously disappearing  in 2009, has kept a low profile since appearing at his election victory in May.

But, in a rare and candid interview with an Argentinian media group, Chapur has revealed that Sanford used to send cards with photos of his family to her at Christmas.

Sanford was criticized after cameras caught the moment one of his sons met Chapur for the first time on stage at an election rally.

But the former television journalist has now admitted that although she has met all four of her lover's sons, she rarely spends time with them.

'I’ve seen them very little because there isn’t much time, but, yes, they’re doing great,' she told InfobaeTV, a video streaming website which Chapur still writes columns for.

Although she coyly refused to say how the couple became romantically involved, Chapur said they first met in Uruguay in 2001 and were first friends for ten years.

'I would receive Christmas cards with photographs of his family,' the woman Sanford once described as his soul mate said.

Their affair was revealed in 2009, when he told staff he was hiking in the mountains as a cover story for his romantic rendezvous with Chapur. 

Sanford was caught by reporters at the 
airport after his trip, and he admitted the affair. His wife filed for 
divorce in the aftermath.

Last August, he proposed to Chapur and she appeared on stage with him in May, when he won a congressional seat.

Sanford is serving as an 
elected official for the Palmetto State after winning against Democratic challenger, Elizabeth Colbert Busch.

Earlier in the campaign, Sanford told
 MailOnline that she was flown in from her native Argentina for his 
primary victory party, and he did not expect her to be there when he 
was onstage with his two teenage sons.

That
 struck his ex-wife Jenny Sanford the wrong way, however, as she went on
 to confirm to a reporter that the awkward expression on her son's face 
was because that was the first time that he ever actually met the new 
woman in his father's life.

The dust has now settled and the Argentinian beauty is now adjusting to her new life as a politician's partner, dividing her time between being in the U.S. with Sanford and trips to Buenos Aires.

'When we’re together, we live together,'
 Chapur told InfobaeTV, adding that since his election it was more difficult for Sanford to make trips to Argentina.

She added: 'I’m starting out, I can’t tell you much yet,' before adding that she was happy being with Sanford.

Despite the election being over, Chapur was keen to point out her fiance was driven by a desire to work for his country rather than earn lots of money.

'Everybody has a fantasy that governors or lawmakers make a lot of money,' Chapur said. 'I’m going to take away that fantasy because a governor in the United States makes $108,000 per year, and from that you have to take out 33 per cent in taxes ... it’s not even enough to pay for private school for his children.'
