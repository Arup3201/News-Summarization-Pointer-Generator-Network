Support: Samantha Green, 23, has been charged with son's murder - but her family is standing by her

The family of a California mother accused of killing her 20-day-old son who was found dead under heavy brush have said they are standing by her.

Samantha Green, 23, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday, three days after her son, Justice Rees, was found dead in wetlands in Knight's Landing near the Sacramento River.

Green, who had been reported missing with her son on Monday, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story.

'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by CBS.

'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much.

'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.'

Frank Rees, Green's partner and Justice's father, also said he was standing by his fiancée.

'I will stand by her side through all of this,' he told KXTV. 'I know that she wouldn't intentionally hurt that baby. If there was some sort of accident or something that either she's not remembering or that she feels ashamed of or guilty about, she knows I'll forgive her.'

Green was reported missing last Monday after she failed to visit her father, Randy, on Saturday February 21, as planned.

Frank Rees posted on Facebook on Tuesday begging Green to come home with their son.

'If anyone sees my beautiful fiancé [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.'

Later that day, she called police to say she had been abducted with her son and that the boy was missing.

Passerby Ricardo Villaseñor then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough, News 10 reported.  

Villaseñor said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river.

'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.'

She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough.

Police arrived around 5.30pm and found her 2011 Chevy Traverse on the other side of the slough, separated from where the mother was by trees and brush.

Sheriff's deputies launched a search that lasted through the night and into the morning, combing water and vegetation before finally finding Justice's remains shortly before 10am on Wednesday.

A spokesman for the sheriff's and coroner's office Captain Larry Cecchettini said the boy was 'located in a thicket of brush right off the slough'. An autopsy is underway to determine the cause of his death.

Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. 

On Saturday, Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto announced at a press conference that Green had been arrested and would be charged with murder. The district attorney has yet to decide what degree of murder she will face.

'We have come to the conclusion that Mrs. Green was the sole individual responsible for the death of her child,' Prieto said. 

Prieto did not give any information as to why they decided to charge Green, but did say that authorities were not able to substantiate claims that she had been abused.

'She made comments about she was there for so many hours screaming and hollering,' Prieto said. 'We were able to determine that perhaps (that) didn't happen.' 

He said that Green and her baby son had been the only two in her car, and added that authorities did not have knowledge of anyone else being involved. 

She is being held without bail at Yolo County jail. 

After police identified Justice's body on Wednesday, the family spoke of their heartbreak.

'They loved baby Justice,' said paternal grandfather Bill, with whom the young couple and their son had been living. 'Frank just loved to carry him around at night when he was, he was fussing. Samantha, gosh, I understand she's crushed.

'It's like it's not real for me, it's like I can't imagine you know. This whole house is full of baby clothes, bassinet, all that stuff.'
