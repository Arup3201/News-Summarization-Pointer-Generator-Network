Swansea City have completed the signing of out-of-contract striker Bafetimbi Gomis on a free transfer, one year after failing in an £8.5million bid to buy the Frenchman from Lyon.

The 28-year-old, who scored 62 goals in 172 games for Lyon, has joined on a four-year contract after completing his medical on Friday.

The move is still subject to international clearance, but Swansea are confident of no late hitches.

Coup: Swansea have fought off competition from Premier League rivals for Gomis

It is significant signing for the 
Welsh club, though it is understood Gomis is not considered a 
replacement for Wilfried Bony, whose impressive 25-goal debut season at 
Swansea has been followed by a good showing at the World Cup.

Swansea had attempted to sign Gomis last summer, but he opted to let his contract run down in France.

The
 striker, who has 12 caps for France, scored 22 goals last season, plus 
25 the previous campaign, after signing for Lyon for 13m euros in July 
2009 from St Etienne. 

His arrival follows the signing of goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski from Arsenal.
