The Canadian Grand Prix was completely all over the place with so many things happening.

We had a hybrid failure which was huge. The team thought that a problem of this kind would not allow us to finish the race because it affected both my brakes and the fuel.

While the fuel turned out to be OK – but only just because we managed to save some under the safety car – looking after the brakes was a mission.

During the race, we have to take care of the brakes anyway; even if the hybrid hadn't failed, it was still very critical. So, with the hybrid failing it became a huge issue, an almost impossible task from the point of view of the team, but we had to manage it.

It took a lot of time to get back into a rhythm with all these handicaps, but I eventually found that tempo and it was awesome to see that I could keep the whole pack behind, with not one, but two massive handicaps.

I had to reduce the amount I was using the rear brakes, so that meant braking much more with the front brakes, and I also lost in excess of 100 horsepower with the loss of hybrid power from the engine. So to finish second was a really good result when you take all of that into consideration.

To be honest, I was surprised I managed to keep everybody behind me for as long as I did.   I was banging in qualifying laps, really going for it, and the gap remained identical to the guys behind. I knew that if one of them passed me the whole train would get me. So I had to stay ahead of them.

Looking back, it's funny because I did not know what position I was in. I was so slow, and I had a Force India, in Sergio Perez, behind me. I had also asked my engineer Tony Ross to reduce communication because I wanted to focus.

I knew the job I had to do whatever position I was in. I had to keep the guy who was behind me, behind me. I only realised I finished second after the race, and I was pretty happy with that because I thought it was a lot worse!

Our aspirations are of course to win and dominate, but in hindsight I am pleased with the result.   It was good damage limitation and what happened in Montreal shows we are not bulletproof when it comes to reliability. The team has put a lot of energy into resolving that however, and I am very confident that the team can sort out anything, and I am sure they will find a solution to what happened.  

I'll drink to that: Rosberg was pleased to have finished 2nd in Canada after a race plagued with reliability issues

I am now 22 points clear of Lewis in the championship. I feel the momentum has swung back a bit in my favour, and that is what I had to do, so I just need to keep it going now.

The lead of the title race is certainly a good place to be in, but it is still early days and there is a long way to go.

The psychological impact of beating Lewis to pole in Canada wasn't something I considered that much. Montreal is a track like any other, and on any other circuit if I do a good job then I believe I will be quickest.

I did not approach it in a different way, or consider it to be a "special" track, or "Lewis's" track, because he has won there three times before.

We will be bringing some updates on our braking system to the Austrian Grand Prix and that is great because it is a region where I still need to work on because I am not 100 per cent confident in that area.

We have something new to try - we took an update to Montreal and it didn't work - so I am looking forward to testing it out in Austria because I always look forward to something that has the potential to improve our car.

Other than that, I think the track will suit us, but at this moment in time any circuit suits us. We are just quick everywhere. But we must keep pushing because the opposition is also pushing. In Montreal the gap was not quite as big as we expected, particularly in qualifying.

Cheer we go: Nico watches Germany in their opening World Cup game against Portugal

I am a massive Germany fan, so I've been loving the World Cup. The first game against Portugal - where we won 4-0 - was just so cool. It was awesome. It is so emotional to follow them and watch them play and they are the favourites now after that performance.

I visited them in their training camp before they left for Brazil and you could see they were working well together and were enjoying a great atmosphere.

Externally, there had been some negative press towards them, but internally they were very, very strong and it was a privilege to visit them ahead of the World Cup.

We fear the Dutch, but Chile are one of the surprises of the World Cup. They have looked strong.

Away from Brazil, I went to Ibiza for a training camp. I also took the engineers out to a track day in Bedford earlier this week.

It was great for them to get a racing insight, and they all got to drive a proper single-seater car on their own so they could feel for the first time what it's like to be a Formula One driver. Maybe now they will show a little bit more empathy towards me!

They had an instructor next to them for all the different experiences except for when they drove the single-seater car, so they really appreciated how difficult it is to listen whilst driving. That is a good thing, because now they will understand to keep the communication over the radio to me to a minimum during the races!

We also took part in a big Mercedes-Benz commercial at Silverstone on Wednesday. They are using the F1 team to promote their road car technologies. We were filming with the race car out on track and did some funny things with the road car, too.

Team bonding: Nico enjoyed a track day with his Mercedes engineers at Bedford Aerodrome earlier this week

The news about Michael earlier this week was great and was so nice to hear. It is such a big, positive step because he has been in a coma for such a long time.

I wish his family and friends a lot of strength and I wish him as good a recovery as possible. If someone can do that, then it is Michael because he was always such a fighter during his brilliant career.
