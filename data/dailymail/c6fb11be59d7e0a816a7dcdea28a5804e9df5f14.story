A high school baseball team forfeited the championship game because they were unwilling to play against a girl.

Our Lady of Sorrows school refused to play Mesa Preparatory Academy this evening because  Paige Sultzbach, 15, covers the second base. 

The student had already agreed to not play two previous games with the highly religious school in the Arizona league.

A league of her own: Paige Sultzbach, 15, plays at second base for the Mesa Preparatory Academy's baseball team in Arizona

The girl's father John Sultzbach told Fox News: 'We hadn’t anticipated coming across that. I think it’s sad.'

Miss Sultzbach's team has won every single game but supported their teammate's decisions to want to play.

Our
Lady of Sorrows issued a statement saying they felt compelled to 
forfeit because they do not allow mixed athletics and believe in 
teaching boys and girls separately. 

Our Lady of Sorrows, is run by the Society of St. Pius X, a branch of the Catholic Church which broke away in 1970.

Stand by me: Mesa Preparatory Academy's baseball team stood by Miss Sultzbach's decision to want to play in the championship game eventhough it meant their rivals defaulted

The Society of St. Pius X has schools across the U.S. where they teach male students to be 'deferential' to female classmates. 

Randy Baum, executive director of the Arizona Charter Athletic Association, said Our Lady of Sorrows had pulled out of games in the past because there were girls on the team.

However before the baseball season began this year, the school asked if any teams had girl players - but Miss Sultzbach had not yet joined the squad.
