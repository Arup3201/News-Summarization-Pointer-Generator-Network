For just under five minutes on Saturday, England’s supporters found their voice.

With Springbok lock Victor Matfield in the sin bin, Stuart Lancaster’s side finally gave the 82,125 fans inside Twickenham hope with two tries to level the score at 20-20.

Swing Low echoed around the rain-soaked old stadium but they had barely got through the first verse before it all went flat again. Just as the power failed before the match, the lights went out on England’s momentarily sparky performance.

With Matfield still off, the hulking Schalk Burger muscled his way over in the right-hand corner and South Africa never looked back.

Another consolation try seconds from time put gloss on the scoreboard but, make no mistake, for large parts of this game England were abject. If the alarm bells were ringing following defeat to the All Blacks, the sirens are screaming from the Twickenham rooftops after this loss. Five defeats in succession, albeit against the best two sides in the world, is England’s worst run since 2006.

And as the countdown to the World Cup continues, there is no sign of significant improvement.

For the second week running, an opposition No7 — this time Burger — won the man-of-the-match award, leaving more questions over England captain Chris Robshaw’s suitability for the openside role.

For the second week running, England were second best at the breakdown.

For the second week running, Owen Farrell was unable to spark his back line.

For the second week running, the scoreboard told a false story.

England created next to nothing when South Africa had a full complement on the field. On the few occasions they did, they bombed their chances.

The first 15 minutes were truly dire with balls regularly spilled in slippery, but far from treacherous, handling conditions against a side who tackled fiercely, sat back and waited for their chances to come. And come they did.

Before England knew it, they were 10-0 down and they were lucky to reach half time at 13-6. That became 20-6 just after the break when Cobus Reinach crossed for a brilliantly worked try before England briefly rallied with Matfield in the bin.

But with momentum swinging, Burger and co wrestled control back and closed out the game. England had few answers.

Lancaster said: ‘We got some good field position in the second half and took those chances well. In the first half we could have been a bit smarter in those conditions. It was one of those days when territory was going to be important and in the first half South Africa benefited from our errors.

‘But we’re not going to sit here feeling sorry for ourselves because I believe in the coaches, I believe in the players and I believe in what we’re doing.’

No one player should not carry the can for another collectively poor display but No8 Billy Vunipola will not seek out the highlights reel of this match with any relish.

Substituted after 43 minutes, the young Saracen can rarely have produced a more error-strewn display. Ben Morgan will surely start next week if the strike-threatened clash with Samoa goes ahead.

Almost as soon as Vunipola was replaced by Morgan, England found some bite. Two tries in three minutes from the industrious David Wilson and then from Morgan himself gave England’s fans hope.

But like so many times under Stuart Lancaster’s reign, the home side flattered to deceive, lacking the nous to beat one of the Southern Hemisphere’s big three.

Just as New Zealand did last week, South Africa gripped this game at precisely the right time. Once again England were strangled as discipline disappeared and attacking quality went missing.

Dylan Hartley was sent to the bin for a cynical 61st-minute stamp on Duane Vermeulen, which could easily have brought a red card from referee Steve Walsh. As it was, the yellow compounded his side’s woes and undid a lot of excellent work from England’s hooker.

Indeed, most concerning for England’s coaches is that despite the set-piece being rock solid, they are failing to create chances and field position on the back of it. England out-scrummaged their opponents with ease in an area the Springboks would have expected to dominate.

England’s lineout functioned well again, with Courtney Lawes enjoying a fine game in tandem with his Northampton team-mate Hartley. So what on earth is going wrong?

1) Losing the breakdown battle. Must generate quick ball for the backs.

if you won’t use them?2) Talented wingers are isolated. Why pick them  

3) Kicking game needs improvement. No territory means no points.

4) Missed chances. England must start taking the few they’re creating.

5) Talk straight. Some home truths need telling behind closed doors.

In his first start on the right wing, Anthony Watson hardly touched the ball while Jonny May was also criminally underused on the other flank.

England’s much-criticised kicking game was barely any better on Saturday, with Farrell unable to manoeuvre his forwards around the pitch and lacking the passing game to get the back line moving. 

The England No10 was completely outshone by his opposite man Pat Lambie, who kicked 16 points including a late drop goal and pulled the strings superbly for his side.

Scrum-half Danny Care was ponderous around the breakdown as England’s back row were dominated and the quick ball backs desperately crave to attack the gain-line never materialised.

Tom Wood carried better than in recent matches but gave away too many penalties while Dave Attwood failed to let Watson loose with the line at his mercy on 25 minutes.

Same old mistakes, same old story. Lancaster may not be for turning, but England’s fans deserve so much better than this.

With the World Cup looming, there’s very little to sing about.
