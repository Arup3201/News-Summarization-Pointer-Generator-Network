Czech student Alexandra Drbohlavova, 22 - known as Sasa to her friends - died after she was stabbed up to 15 times in her head, neck, and chest in her tent at an eco-farm in a remote rainforest area of Costa Rica.

Alfred Saunders, 20, the son of two high-flying academics has been arrested for the sexually motivated murder at the paradise hideaway in Central America.

Lenka Janalova, 22, a fellow student from Charles University in Prague said: 'I can’t believe this has happened. It is an absolute shock to all of us who knew her.

Alexandra - a keen volleyball player - had gone on to study at Florida's Miami University in the U.S.

'Sasa was such a kind, sweet person. She was always smiling and willing to help others.

'I can only imagine the horror she must have felt when she found this man inside her tent.

'She was always so calm and peaceful - the horror of this is beyond words.'

Sasa - a keen volleyball player - had gone on to study at Florida's Miami University in the U.S.

She had also been invited to spend Christmas and the New Year with friends at the university's United Methodist ministry in Miami but turned them down to travel to Costa Rica where she had volunteered to work on the remote organic farm.

International volunteers are offered free food and lodging in return for working to help establish an ecologically friendly development in the rainforest. The farm, run by British ecology graduate Nic Donati and his American wife Erin, has been closed since the murder.

Pictures emerged of a smiling Sasa today on a visit with her university friends to Miami's Domino Park in Little Havana, taken just five days before she flew off to Central America.

As a result of Costa Rica’s reputation for relative safety in Central America, it has proved popular with British ‘gap-year’ youngsters seeking adventure.

Saunders, who lives in a £1million mews house in exclusive Notting Hill, West London, with his mother Dr Catia Galatariotou, an expert on the sexual development of children, appears to have been travelling the world for some time. Police chief Mr Morales said Saunders arrived at the farm only hours before the killing.

He added: ‘The mystery is what he was doing at the farm. He turned up the day before the incident with no luggage and virtually just the clothes he was wearing. We believe he came from Nicaragua.

‘The farm manager says he doesn’t know him and he hadn’t arranged to do any volunteer work, and it appears he and his wife have taken pity on him and allowed him to borrow a tent and stay.’

The murder took place late last Wednesday night, when Mr Donati is understood to have heard screams coming from Miss Drbohlavova’s tent.

Tourist destination: Costa Rica has many national parks with volcanoes and rainforests. As a result of the country's reputation for relative safety in Central America, it has proved popular with British 'gap-year' youngsters seeking adventure.

Mr Morales – who claimed Saunders had a history of schizophrenia – said: ‘The suspect was sleeping in a tent near to the murder victim’s. The manager of the farm heard screaming and shouting and as he approached the woman’s tent, saw the suspect coming out with a torch in his hand. He shone his torch at him and saw blood on his clothes and face.

'He managed to apprehend him and tie him up with the help of his wife. The victim was already near death when he looked inside her tent. There’s no phone at the farm so he brought the suspect to us and asked for help for the woman.

‘She was already dead by the time help arrived. The suspect told us he can’t remember anything about what happened.’ The policeman added: ‘The suspect had a lot of marks on him which appear to indicate he was involved in a struggle.’

Saunders was taken to the regional capital of Aguas Claras de Upala, 50 miles from the farm. He was then remanded in custody following a court hearing in the middle of the night.

Mr Morales said a ‘green Interpol notice’ issued as an international warning of a potential offender, had been sent out about Saunders.

‘It’s for offences relating to the use of firearms and explosives and also for a sex attack,’ he said.

British police and Interpol were unable to confirm the claim. But a Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We can confirm a British national has been arrested in Costa Rica. We are providing consular assistance.’

Saunders’ father Max Saunders, 54, is a professor of English at King’s College London, and lives in fashionable Hampstead, North London.

His mother Dr Galatariotou, 56, who is separated from Mr Saunders, has lectured on psychoanalysis at University College London.

Miss Drbohlavova was a philosophy student from Prague. She had spent two terms at university in Miami, before travelling to Costa Rica. Friends said she spent every summer carrying out voluntary work, usually with children.
