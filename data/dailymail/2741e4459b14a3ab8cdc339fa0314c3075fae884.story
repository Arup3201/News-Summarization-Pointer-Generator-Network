Everyone has had to deal a delayed flight and the headache it produces.

The seemingly constant problem in air travel in the U.S. isn't just an inconvenience, one study found that it drains $40 billion from the economy every year.

A group of academics ran computer simulations on six million flights at over 300 airports in 2010 to determine how each delay spreads throughout the entire system and causes further problems.

Slowdown: The computer simulation shows scattered flight delays across the U.S.

The knock-on effect: Three days later, the number of flight delays has increased and spread coast to coast

Better days: This chart shows one day where air travel was relatively on-time

The researchers, led by Pablo Fleurquin from the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems in Spain, used computer models that are similar to how the spread of diseases or wildfire are monitored.

Their paper, published today, has the potential to help 
airlines change their schedules in advance to anticipate and prevent 
delays before they happen.

The worst contributor to delays is flight crews and 
passengers missing their connecting flights, which makes sense since a 
plane cannot takeoff if its pilot isn't available.

Flight crews and passengers that are delayed from another flight is the greatest contributor to spreading delays nationwide.

Airport congestion prevents flights from taking off because too many planes are competing for runways.

Scheduling connecting flights without enough time between legs.

Weather and labor problems also spread delays but not as seriously.

The other two main problems are schedules that are too tight and airport congestion.

The scheduling issue occurs when one leg of a connecting flight is unable to land on time, throwing a wrench into other scheduled takeoffs.

And congestion at runways creates more delays because many airports

cannot handle the amount of planes that need to take off at a given time.

The study showed that problems like 
bad weather and labor disruptions aren't as significant in spreading 
delays since they tend to occur in smaller clusters and don't create 
system-wide headaches.

It 
also demonstrated how the problems typically do not have lasting effects
from one day to the other since the causes of delays begin again each 
day.
