The latest issue of Entertainment Weekly magazine has published a cover headline that appears to make reference to the Colorado massacre on Friday.

The shooting, during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in a cinema in Aurora, Colorado, left 12 people dead and 58 injured.

The latest front cover of Entertainment Weekly publicises the new Batman film, with the headline 'Batman's killer finale'.  The cover photo is of the superhero and his nemesis Bane in gas mask and black, military-style clothing.

A gunman dressed in similar combat 
gear and gas mask burst into the Colorado cinema and randomly sprayed 
bullets into the audience.

The EW edition is dated July 20 but came out a week earlier. It features 
interviews with director Christopher Nolan and 
actor Christian Bale.

The cover headline meant to use the word 'killer' in a wordplay for 'excellent', but has 
nevertheless been branded a 'gaffe' by bloggers, and may be insensitive to families of the victims.

The edition is still available on newsstands. Entertainment Weekly was yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment.

Shooter James Holmes was accused of using the emergency exit to access the screening of the Hollywood blockbuster in Aurora last Friday.

A witness, who has not been named, told local TV station KCNC: 'As soon as the movie started, somebody came in, all black, gas mask, armour, and threw a gas can into the audience, and it went off, and then there were gunshots that took place.'

Warner Bros., the studio behind The Dark Knight Rises, is to make a 'substantial' donation to charities supporting the survivors and families affected by the Colorado shooting.

The studio will contribute to a fund through givingfirst.org, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The studio has also cancelled the movie's premiere in Paris and other press events out of respect.

Despite the tragedy, The Dark Knight Rises has broken box-officerecords.

The film was on track to earn more than $160million in the U.S. and Canada in its opening weekend, which would be a record for a non-3D movie.

‘This tragedy did not seem to impact the box office in a major way,’ said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst for Hollywood.com.

He added: ‘For this film to still be in the rarified air of the op-three openings of all time is phenomenal, given the unfortunate circumstances surrounding the release of this film.’
