They are the haunting, hooded figures, who walk the streets of Spain's towns and villages during the last week of Lent.

And these penitents, in their white robes and heavy hoods, were no different as they took part in the annual commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ, a mesmerising week-long celebration throughout the country.  

In Zamora, in the region of Castile and Leon, penitents from 'Cristo de la Buena Muerte' or 'Good Dead Christ' brotherhood carry a Jesus Christ figure as they take part in a haunting night time procession.

During the emotional festival, penitents from several religious brotherhoods take part in processions, carrying life-size effigies of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary through cobblestone city streets, accompanied by dramatic drum beats and mournful music.

Also known as Semana Santa, during the week-long celebrations, participants wear gowns and conical hoods - a tradition that was meant to maintain their anonymity - during their hauntingly beautiful penance processions.

Although the most-visited city during the Catholic celebration is Seville, in Andalucia, Zamora, in the north-west of the country, is also well known for its 16 religious brotherhoods and fraternities.

In 1986, Holy Week in Zamora was declared a tourist interest of Spain and visitors continue to descend on the city in the lead-up to Easter, particularly to line the streets to view the scheduled processions.

The fraternities weave their way through the city streets from early morning until late into the night.

In Seville, there are more than 50 church brotherhoods, some of which date as far back as the 13th century, while in Zamora, some documented references to celebration can be traced back to 1279.

The first cofradia founded is believed to be La Santa Vera Cruz or True Cross, which dates back to the 14th century, though most brotherhoods as we know them today were created in the 20th century.

While at first glance, the marches may appear sinister, they are a stunning celebration of emotion as brothers make their way to cathedrals

In maintenance of tradition, many brothers will carry processional candles and may even walk barefoot while wearing their heavy robes.

Though at first glance, the processions may seem sinister, Holy Week is truly a stunning celebration of pageantry and raw emotion.

The brothers make their way from parish churches to the cathedral and back again, each bearing their own Virgin Mary and Jesus statues, as well as colourful misterios (depictions of bible scenes) and pasos (floats). 

Holy Week, as its known, begins the Sunday before Easter (known as Palm or Passion Sunday) and continues through to Easter Sunday.
