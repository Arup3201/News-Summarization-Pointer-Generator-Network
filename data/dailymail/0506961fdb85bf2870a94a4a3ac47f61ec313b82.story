A defamation case involving two of Tampa Bay's best known DJs has taken a bizarre turn after one of the shock jock's attorneys was arrested for DUI - in what he claims was set up by the other side.

Charles Campbell is representing Todd 'MJ' Schnitt, who is suing on-air rival Bubba 'The Love Sponge' Clem for comments he made about him and his wife while on the radio.

On Wednesday night, Campbell was stopped by police near the Malio's Prime Steakhouse in Tampa, Florida and was arrested after he refused to take a blood alcohol test.

The 64-year-old had met 30-year-old Melissa Personius, who turned out to work as a paralegal for Clem's legal team, at the restaurant and they had drinks together.

Police testified in court on Friday that a member of Clem's defense team called them to have Campbell arrested for DUI, ABC News reported.

'She lied to Mr. Campbell when... asked where she worked,' fellow Schnitt attorney Jonathan Ellis said in court Friday morning, as the team asked for a mistrial.

'She bought him drinks, she specifically, we believe,
asked him to move her car and we believe that she or had somebody else 
call Tampa police to have Mr. Campbell pulled over.'

Schnitt's lawyers said the other side 
could have achieved a legal advantage because Campbell had left his briefcase 
with important documents in the paralegal's car when he was stopped by police.

Personius, who has worked for the firm representing Clem for five years, said in court Friday that she had not opened the briefcase.

She repeatedly invoked her right to remain silent while on the stand, and would not say whether the firm sent her to the bar or whether she was told to buy Campbell drinks while there.

Personius has her own criminal record that includes a DUI arrest in 2009 and an arrest in 2011 for driving with a revoked license, WTSP reported.

The trial is expected to resume as normal on Monday, as it enters its third week.

Schnitt and his wife Michelle are suing Clem claiming he made 'false, highly 
offensive and defamatory' statements about them on air.

Claims: Incidents include when Clem called former Assistant State Attorney Michelle Schnitt, right, who often appeared on her husband's, left, show, a 'whore

The spat began when Clem accused Schnitt of accepting favours and gifts from businesses in exchange for plugs on the air.

He then accused Mrs Schnitt, a former assistant state attorney, of conspiring with State Attorney Mark Ober to bring animal cruelty charges against him after in 20001 after he presided over the slaughter and barbecue of a wild boar on-air.

Although Clem was later acquitted of animal cruelty, he vowed revenge against the Schnitts for being prosecuted.

Last week, Clem said the accusations and name-calling were all just an act and that he only attacked the Schnitt's alter ego, MJ Kelli.

Defense: Clem said the comments were directed at MJ the radio personality (pictured), not the man

The campaign, Clem's attorney, Joseph Diaco, told jurors, 'was juvenile, offensive, maybe even disgusting, but wasn't personal'.

He was backed up by Brent Hatley, a 'Bubba' executive 
producer and cast member, who said: 'MJ Kelli is not a real person. It's a character. Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger is not the terminator.'

In the suit, the Schnitts claim Clem took a battle for ratings too 
far, encouraging his fans, known as Bubba's Army, to target 
the Schnitts, reported the Tampa Bay Online.

He told how he was
with his children at WestShore Plaza in 2008 when a man walked up to 
him in the food court and yelled obscene comments and how a similar incident happened later at a restaurant.

He said that eggs were thrown at his house with a note reading 'Bubba army Rulesssssss!!!!!!'

friend Bubba The Love Sponge

On tapes heard by the jurors the voice of Bubba the Love Sponge said 'Fight back. … Be a man. I'm calling your wife a whore.'

When discussing why Mrs  Schnitt was called a whore, Clem's former co-host Matt 'Spiceboy' Loyd said it was 'just a general term to try to stir it up' and was not to accuse her of being promiscuous.

The past few months have been difficult for Clem as in October Hulk Hogan settled his lawsuit against him.

The wrestler has dropped charges against his former best friend over his leaked sex tape, but is still suing Bubba's ex-wife Heather Clem - who stars in the saucy video alongside Hulk - and website host Gawker Media for allegedly violating his privacy.
