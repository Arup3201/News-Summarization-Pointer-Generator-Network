A Heathrow worker drove his baggage cart into the side of the plane causing over £1 million of damage after forgetting how big his vehicle was.

Terrified passengers had to be evacuated from the stricken airliner after the costly collision which knocked one of the crew off her feet as she stood in the cockpit just minutes before the Airbus 321 was due to take off.

Engineers later found the vehicle had 'sliced through' the aircraft's tail - just inches from its fuel line, Uxbridge Magistrates' Court heard.

The cost of fixing the Scandinavian Airways plane is estimated to have been up to £1.2m - but high loader driver Dennis Jackson, 60, was yesterday fined just £250 over the incident after magistrates heard he had forgotten which vehicle he was driving.

The jet's 175 passengers were boarding on the jetway at around 10.15am on June 12 this year when the accident happened at Terminal 3.

Amanda McCabe, prosecuting, said the aircraft shook violently during the crash, while another member of ground crew feared the impact 'would cause a fire.'

She said: 'The damage was very clear - it had sliced through the rear of the aircraft, causing extensive damage.

'The fuel line was very close to where it had impacted, and there were passengers and crew on the aircraft - it was preparing to move away from the stand.

'This collision was due to the defendant not following instructions contained within the Heathrow Airport Operational Safety Instructions.'

After being evacuated, the plane remained out of action for 13 days while repair crews brought it back to working order.

The plane's rear access door remained jammed shut and later had to be hammered open because its metal locks had been bent.

High loaders are used by ground crew to move luggage around airports, and can be raised to meet the height of a plane's hold.

Bethan Charnley, defending, said Jackson was responsible for an 'expensive accident' after forgetting he was driving the largest type of the vehicle.

The high loader in question had earlier that day been used to lift a car into an aircraft's hold, she said.

'This wasn't needed any more, and he was asked to take that back,' she said.

'Unfortunately the difference in size led to the accident occurring - Mr Jackson is used to driving the regular-sized one.

'He misjudged the distance and failed to take into account the width and height.

'His misjudgement was something that lasted a matter of moments, he wasn't going fast, wasn't taking any shortcuts or acting in a risky manner.

'He is extremely sorry that this accident occurred. He has been devastated by this. If he could go back and have that moment again he certainly would be careful.'

Ms Charnley added Jackson had an 'exemplary record' since being hired by contractor Dnata in January 2006.

The lawyer said guidelines issued by airport owner BAA recommended that cones were laid out clearly marking which areas were safe to drive in, but these had not been followed.

After the crash, Jackson was fined one week's wages and handed a final written warning, but his employers were said to be awaiting the outcome of today's case before deciding whether to take further action.

Handing the driver a £150 fine and ordering him to pay £85 towards prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge, chair of the bench Marilyn Levene said he had made a 'genuine mistake.'

His driving licence cannot be endorsed with penalty points because the incident, which breaches Heathrow Airport byelaws, did not take place on a public road.

'We do feel very sorry that this happened to you,' said Mrs Levene.

'We do accept this was a momentary lapse in concentration after, clearly, a very good career.'

Jackson, of Ashford, Middlesex, admitted driving without due care and attention in breach of section 5(1)(b) of the Heathrow Airport - London Byelaws 1996.

Following his guilty plea, the prosecution offered no evidence on a separate charge under the same byelaws of driving in a way likely to cause danger or nuisance.
