A Good Samaritan has been blinded in one eye after he was hit in the face with a glass and knocked unconscious while trying to break up a fight.

Sean Finnegan, 23, was with three friends in a nightclub when he witnessed a brawl on the dance floor and went in to calm things.

But he was attacked himself, and now has no vision in his left eye and doctors have told him it may have to be removed altogether.

The incident occurred when Mr Finnegan was at Antix nightclub in Bristol.

He said: 'I had been to a few bars in Park Street before heading to Antix.

'Me and my friend were at the bar getting some drinks when I saw some pushing happening on the dance floor.

'I went over to try and get my friend away and break up the fight when I was hit over the back of the head and knocked unconscious.

'The next thing I remember was being sat on a chair in the corner of the club with security staff performing first aid on me.'

Police were called to the scene and Mr Finnegan, from Hanham, was rushed to the Bristol Royal Infirmary.

Speaking from his hospital bed today, Mr Finnegan added: 'I have no vision in my left eye and doctors say there is no pressure in it.

'If they canâ€™t work out why they might have to remove my eye all together.

'I feel OK about it - obviously I am in quite a lot of pain but there are much worse things that can happen to people.

'I currently work as a builder so obviously losing my sight will probably affect my job, but I will have to take each day as it comes.'

The gruesome picture has since been shared on social media, with friends and family calling for anyone with any information to come forward and give a statement.

Avon and Somerset Police, who have been working closely with him since the attack, arrested a 24-year-old man on suspicion of assault.

A police spokesperson said: 'We were called to reports of an assault at around 2.30am on Sunday July 27 in Park Street.

'A 24-year-old man from the Bristol area has been arrested on suspicion of assault and has been released on police bail.

'The victim was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary for treatment.'
