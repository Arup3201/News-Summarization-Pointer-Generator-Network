Manchester United new boy Angel di Maria celebrated his first goal in English football against Queens Park Rangers by making a heart sign with his hands.

It is remarkably similar to Di Maria's former Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale, who also shapes his hands into a heart after scoring for club and country.

In fact, Bale trademarked his goal celebration in June 2013 which is a gesture to his childhood sweetheart Emma Rhys-Jones.

However Di Maria used the heart celebration, which is to highlight his love for football, before Bale as the United midfielder has been doing it since his time with Benfica.

Di Maria did the sign of the heart in December 2009 during the Portuguese side's 2-1 win over AEK Athens, while Bale was first seen doing it in 2010.

United fans will be hoping they can see more of Di Maria's celebration over the course of his time at Old Trafford.

And if they do, it truly will be love.
