The cross-country custody battle between Olympic gold medalist Bode Miller and his ex-Sara McKenna became so bitter that the skier decided to change the name she gave their child at birth - without her permission.

That is just one of the revelations to come out of the New York City Family Court over the past two weeks as proceedings started today that could ultimately swing custody back to 27-year-old McKenna.

Despite McKenna registering her son under his father's given name, Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, the champion skier pointedly got permission from a Californian court to add Nathaniel as his middle name and now calls him Nate, instead of Sam, his birth name.

Miller has been locked in a custody dispute with his former lover since their son was born in February - a child McKenna claims he tried to make her abort.

Born to McKenna in New York, the boy, now nine-months-old was transferred back to the custody of Miller, 36, in California because a New York Family Court referee called her 'irresponsible' and 'reprehensible' for moving to Manhattan when she was seven months pregnant.

Miller's attorney's successfully argued that McKenna left California to get a more sympathetic hearing for herself to gain custody.

He asked her to return to California, but she refused. However, when the New York court found in his favor, Miller's son was returned to him in May.

However, the ruling raised serious questions about the rights of mothers-to-be and on November 14, the New York Family Court overturned the May ruling and and will begin a re-examination of who will gain custody of the child.

Indeed, women's rights advocates became enraged at the court's decision in May, calling it a threat to the rights of pregnant women to make decisions over their own lives - regardless of the rights of the father.

'Especially with current political pressures to recognize separate legal rights for fetuses, there will be increasing calls on the courts to fault a pregnant woman for moving, to restrain women from living their lives because theyâ€™re pregnant,' said Sarah E. Burns, the head of the Reproductive Justice Clinic at the New York University law school to the New York Times.

McKenna, a former marine, had previously claimed that the skier had suggested she have an abortion. according to the New York Daily News.

When she first told Miller of the pregnancy, he texted her: 'U are going to do this on your own.'

The 36-year-old skier later pushed for joint custody, and a judge ruled that McKenna must return to California for the case, forcing her to give up her studies at Columbia University in New York.

A family court referee at an earlier hearing had described McKenna as 'reprehensible' for moving to New York while pregnant.

After a short fling with Miller, the former Marine had moved to New York to study at Columbia under the GI Bill.

The 27-year-old has applied for temporary custody of the baby, which she named Samuel.

She claimed that when the couple met through a dating website, Miller had said he wanted a large family with her.

McKenna revealed the couple had sex only twice - and that Miller failed to use protection as he assumed she was ready to get pregnant, she said.

'You have to agree to have four of my babies,' Miller had texted McKenna, she told the New York Daily News.

After they met in California, they went their separate ways, and she said he was reluctant to continue a relationship because he wanted a large family, and she did not.

But a few weeks later, they arranged to meet in Florida - and a second tryst led to her becoming pregnant with Samuel.

'He never offered to use a condom,' McKenna said. 'He assumed I was ready to get pregnant.'

While pregnant, she moved to New York - and Miller, who has five Olympic medals, married volleyball player Morgan Beck.

Beck and Miller married in October 2012 and announced they were expecting a child, but Beck had a miscarriage in January.

Days after the devastating news, Miller filed court documents to gain joint custody of his son with McKenna.

Miller sought to force a judge to get McKenna to move back to California, so he could have a relationship with the child. He also sought to have the boy's last name changed to Miller on his birth certificate.

At a hearing earlier this year, the lawyer representing McKenna said it is too late for Miller to try to seek joint custody.

'If you look at the texts [messages] from Bode Miller to my client, he wanted nothing to do with the baby,' attorney Kenneth Eiges said.

Her lawyer also defended his client's decision to live in New York saying it was 'her right'.
