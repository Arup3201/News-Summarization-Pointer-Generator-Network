RAF pilots have been banned from flying the new Lightning II fighter jets in a storm over fears the £100million plane could explode if struck by lightning.

The Ministry or Defence said that the stealth F35-B, which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks, could not be flown within 28 miles of a thunderstorm. 

Named ‘Lightning II’, it was even at risk of its namesake while on the ground with pilots told to move it under cover if less than 11 miles away from a storm.

The fighter was created under  the U.S. 20-year Joint Strike Fighter programme, with the U.S. Government having ordered 2,500 of the Lockheed Martin planes.

In Britain, 14 of the aircraft have been ordered to replace the ageing Harrier jump jet on the decks of the new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers.

But a recent Pentagon report highlighted concerns over the placement of the jet's fuel tanks, which are located all the way through the wing, through the fuselage, around the inlets and back toward the engine. 

Pierre Sprey, a former Pentagon analyst who helped design the F-16 in the early 1970s, compared the engine to 'a blowtorch surrounded by fuel.'

There was also a risk of catching fire if the fighter plane was shot at.

Last June, an F-35 burst into flames as it was taxiing for take-off at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, because the engine had cracked during previous flights manoeuvres.

One of the Pratt & Whitney engines broke apart, pushed through the top of the aeroplane, and caught fire while the pilot was preparing to take off.  

The entire fleet of F-35s was grounded for three weeks, and the plane missed its international debut.

But that was not the end of problems for the fighter jets.

The single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft boasts a helmet mounted display system which is supposed to offer a 360 degree view of the outside of the aircraft. But the MoD admitted there were still 'unresolved issues' surrounding the technology.

SNP defence spokesman Angus Robertson, who brought up the safety issue in a series of parliamentary questions, told the Mirror the MoD were 'burying its head in the sand' over the jet's failures.

He said: 'When they named the aircraft Lightning I don't think they expected that very thing would render them totally useless. Adding to this ­embarrassment is the revelation none of these new jets have yet broken the sound barrier.'

The RAF website states that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was built to be a 'multi-role, all weather, day and night aircraft'.  

Planes have a top speed of 1,300mph, a range of 1,450 miles and can carry a range of weapons including air-to-air rockets and satellite guided bombs.

The design also uses stealth technology which will allow pilots to minimise its radar signature.
