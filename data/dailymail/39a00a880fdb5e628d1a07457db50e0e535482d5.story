She has suffered from several 'Marilyn moments' in the past.

And once again the Duchess of Cambridge failed to tame her skirt as she touched down in a very windy Wellington, New Zealand, on Monday.

Kate's red attire was picked up in a large gust of wind as she juggled baby Prince George and held onto her hat at the same time.

Marilyn moment: The Duchess Of Cambridge nearly suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she touched down in Wellington, New Zealand on Monday with Prince William and baby George

Hands full: Kate was carrying baby George and holding onto the railing of the plane's stairs at the same time

Meanwhile, Prince William disembarked the plane looking carefree and dapper in a navy blue suit.

It is not the first time Kate has suffered a hemline malfunction in the course of official duties.

Her navy skirt blew up at a charity event in London last November and she almost came a cropper in a floral Project D dress as she arrived at Brisbane airport in 2012.

And she only narrowly avoided a wardrobe disaster at Calgary Airport in September 2011 when her feather-light Jenny Packham yellow frock headed skywards.

Hold onto your hat! Kate almost also lost her very expensive red pillarbox hat

Smart: Meanwhile, a hands-free William disembarked the plane looking dapper in a navy blue suit

Not again! This isn't the first time Kate has suffered from a Marilyn moment - a seven months pregnant Kate was hit by a gust of wind in 2012, a Jenny Packham yellow frock almost cost Kate her modesty at Calgary Airport in September 2011, and she almost came a cropper in a floral Project D dress at Brisbane airport in 2012

The Queen's dressmaker Stuart Parvin slips small lead curtain weights, costing just £1.50 for a packet of four, inside the lining of each of the Queen’s exquisite hand-made outfits.

The small circular weights, measure just 1.2inches (32mm) across and weigh less than an ounce each and are sourced from Peter Jones.

Society dressmaker Mr Parvin stitches them into the hem of her garments, which prevents them from blowing up in the wind.

‘The beauty of a handmade outfit is that it hangs just right but, of course, we have a few tricks up our sleeve,’ Mr Parvin told the Daily Mail in an exclusive interview

‘I just pop a couple into the hemline of her dresses and coats and it makes them hang beautifully.

'If there is a flap in the coat then I will sew in one on each side of the split to even it up.

'And sometimes if she is wearing a lightweight chiffon skirt I will sew in an even smaller lead weight the size of a pea or even a length of chain, rather like a dog’s chain. But the curtain weights work beautifully.’

It has been suggested in the past that Kate should perhaps take a leaf out of the Queen's book.

In 2012, the Mail revealed how, despite conducting thousands of public engagements in her 60 years on the throne, the Queen’s decorum has almost never slipped.

Slipped inside the lining of each of the monarch’s exquisite handmade outfits are a couple of small lead curtain weights, costing just £1.50 for a packet of four.

The small circular weights, measure just 1.2inches (32mm) across and weigh less than an ounce each - but prevent the royal hemline from flying away in a gust of wind.

Designer Jenny Packham revealed that she'd received a letter recommending that very trick after pictures of Kate in her billowing yellow dress surfaced in 2012.

'I had a little handwritten letter from a lady in Wisconsin passionately criticising me for the primrose yellow shift dress I made for the duchess,' says Packham, who was born in Southampton, told London's Evening Standard at the time.

'She said didn't I know about putting weights around the bottom of a hem so it can't blow up?

'Well, I didn't know it was going to be worn on a windy runway - but I did think maybe in future I will put in more weighting, just in case...'

Stuart Parvin, the Queen's favourite couturier, revealed the weights he uses for her dresses are sourced from the curtain accessories section of famous Chelsea department store, Peter Jones.

Society dressmaker Mr Parvin then sews them into the hem.

The surprisingly cheap trick seems to work, for the Queen has seemingly never been photographed in public looking even remotely ruffled.

‘Surprisingly, it is nothing fancy. I use curtain weights, lead weights, from Peter Jones’s curtain department. We call them penny weights.' Mr Parvin said.

Unfortunately not all female royals follow the Queen’s lead and have, on occasions, fallen foul of the elements.

The late Diana, Princess of Wales, the Duchess of York and her daughter, Princess Beatrice, have all suffered similar wardrobe malfunctions.

The Duchess of Cambridge arrived in New Zealand wearing a pillar-box red coat by Catherine Walker, a British designer favoured by William’s late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and a pillbox hat by  Gina Foster.

She was also wearing the Queen’s diamond and platinum silver fern brooch, an important New Zealand emblem.

The monarch was given the stunning piece of jewellery by the Women of Auckland on her own visit to the country in 1954  as part of her landmark six-month  Commonwealth tour.

Earlier there had been some uncertainty as to whether the flight would even be able to land after dozens of planes were diverted from Wellington due to low cloud and heavy rain.

But concern eventually evaporated after the couple were seen happily boarding their jet for the final stage of their journey around the world in Sydney.

The family and their 11-strong entourage had left London on Saturday night, taking up the First Class section of a scheduled Qantas flight via Dubai.

Disembarking 27 hours later in Australia, the Duchess looked elegant in a Max Mara wrap dress and beige suede £400 Manolo Blahnik heels, as she carried her waving son in her arms.

Dressed smartly in a freshly pressed blue suit, William walked next to her carrying a battered brown holdall and a plush kangaroo backpack.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force jet carried them on the last three hours of their marathon journey and will also ferry them around the country for the next ten days.

Kate and her son had taken the opportunity to change during the flight, which arrived 20 minutes late and was greeted by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key.

Thanks to the services of her on-board hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker – who is being paid for by Prince Charles out of his private fortune – her famous flowing locks looked eminently salon-worthy.George, meanwhile, sported a summer ensemble in white.

Among the entourage seen disembarking was George’s full-time nanny, Spanish born Maria Teresa Turrion Borallo, a quiet, studious figure, who has not been seen in public before.

While the couple’s previous foreign tours have been dominated by chatter about Kate’s  wardrobe, George will clearly be the centre of attention as his parents spend the next three  weeks touring New Zealand  and Australia.

Traditional: The young prince wore a cream cardigan over a white shirt, matching shorts and soft leather shoes and socks - ideal for a baby who has just started crawling. His outfit was a modern version of the smocked top and peach bloomer style shorts that William wore when he visited the country at the same age

Change of outfit: Both Kate and her son took the opportunity to change during the flight from Sydney to Wellington which was delayed by 20 minutes

Strong gusts: The Duchess' pillbox hat by Gina Foster managed to stay firmly in place despite the windy weather

Royal welcome: The family was greeted by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. Kate wore the Queen's diamond and platinum silver fern brooch, an important New Zealand emblem, that was presented to the Queen on her visit to the nation during her landmark 1953-54 world tour

Traditional welcome: The Duchess rubbed noses with a local dignitary as she and her husband were officially welcomed at Government House in Wellington later on Monday

Eyes front, Kate! She chatted to several Maori warriors as she made her way across the soggy lawn

The warmest of welcomes: William and Kate attended an official welcome ceremony on the lawns outside of Government House later on Monday where they rubbed noses with local dignitaries
