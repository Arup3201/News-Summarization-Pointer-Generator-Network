A New Hampshire museum staff member insisted that a blind eight-year-old girl surrender her cane before entering its exhibit this week.

Abby Duffy was left without the aide of her stick at the Museum of New Hampshire History, in Concord, and had to rely on her family for support as she moved around the museum.

Her mother, Penny Duffy was outraged and wrote about the experience on her blog.

Little Abby Duffy, who has Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, began losing her sight at age six. She is now legally blind

Mrs Duffy said the staff member told them the museum has had 'issues with kids in the past', before forcing the girl to leave the cane at the entrance.

'Perhaps she didn't hear when Chris said Abby was blind,' wrote Mrs Duffy on her blog, according to WMUR9 in New Hampshire.

'Lets decide for just this argument she didn't hear him... regardless, what did she think it was? Who are these kids she spoke of? I envision a ninja army of blind children with white canes trashing the museum. It's a white cane, not a switch blade.'

The museum has since apologized for what it called 'an unfortunate misunderstanding,' between an confused
employee and the Duffy family.

Abby started losing her vision at age six due to Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and she is now is legally blind,Â The Huffington Post reports.

'Abby was really bothered by it on the fire tower. There
are some steep stairs, and she was uncomfortable on it without the 
cane. She's pretty confident, but her whole demeanor changed.'

Despite this, Chris Duffy graciously acceded to the demand - and allowed the cane to be confiscated - because his children were reportedly so excited about visiting the well-traveled historical depository.

But the day proved to be a trial for little Abby, who later told WMUR9, 'I had to keep following my dad...I couldn't really walk on my own and go anywhere by myself.'

'Abby was really bothered by it on the fire tower,' Chris Duffy told the New Hampshire Union Leader.

'There are some steep stairs, and she was uncomfortable on it without the cane. She's pretty confident, but her whole demeanor changed.'

A Delicate Apology: The museum's executive director has since apologized to the Duffys for what it has termed, a 'misunderstanding' between the family and an allegedly confused employee

The museum's executive director, Bill Dunlap, emailed News 9 to explain that the incident was a profound misunderstanding between the Duffys and 'a good employee.'

'We sincerely regret what happened to Abby and her family...which was the result of an unfortunate misunderstanding,' Dunlap reportedly wrote.

'The New Hampshire Historical Society is committed to equal access for all individuals. We are proud of our record over many years of providing access to our facilities to persons with disabilities.'

Mr Dunlop later elaborated to the New Hampshire Union Leader that the employee felt terrible about the incident.

'The employee involved is a good employee, a longtime employee, who has worked that job before,' he reportedly said. 'She just misunderstood that the girl had a legal impairment. It was a terrible misunderstanding, and we have apologized to the family.'

Still, Mrs Duffy, who is president of the New Hampshire chapter of Parents of Blind Children, wondered aloud on her blog over the museum's logic on the matter.

'We have already gotten an apology and I believe it was genuine,' she reportedly wrote, 'but I am very concerned it may happen again. No one should ever have to (go) through what happened to my family.'
