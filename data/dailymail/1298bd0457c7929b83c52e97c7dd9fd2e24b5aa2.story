For most people, taking a 'selfie' is a simple case of aim, pose and snap.

But what happens if an eight-legged intruder wants to get in on the action?

These hilarious photos capture the moment a teenage girl tricked her friend into thinking a spider had photo-bombed their selfies.Â 

Oblivious: Kirsty Middleton (left), 16, and her friend, Jair Townsend, smile at a camera phone while lying on a bed at a house in Basildon, Essex. But unbeknown to Kirsty, they are not alone - as a spider is sat on the sheets

What's that? However, as the girls gaze at the screen, their smiles fade as they spot the eight-legged creature

Is it really there? This photo shows Kirsty glancing over her shoulder to confirm the spider is actually there

OMG! The teenager then opens her mouth and screams, while Jair continues to gaze at the camera phone

The first photo shows Kirsty Middleton, 16, and her friend, Jair Townsend, smiling at a camera phone while lying on a bed at a house in Basildon, Essex.

But unbeknown to Kirsty, they are not alone - as a spider is positioned between their heads on the sheets.

However, as the teenagers gaze at the screen, their smiles suddenly fade as they spot the eight-legged creature.

A subsequent photo shows Kirsty glancing over her shoulder to confirm the spider is actually there, before opening her mouth wide and screaming.

Aaargh! Kirsty is captured screaming at the eight-legged intruder, which is situated in between the girls' heads

It's actually a spider! Jair appears to comprehend the fact that a spider is sat just inches away from her head

Now we've both seen it! She then turns to glance at the creature and also starts screaming, with her eyes wide

Jair then turns to glance at the creature and also starts screaming, while her friend covers her mouth and bursts into a fit of giggles.

But despite their apparent fear, the teenagers continue to lie on the bed - and even manage to keep snapping selfies.

And just seconds later, Jair reveals to Kirsty that the spider is actually a fake arachnid that she has planted on the bed in a bid to scare her friend.

After getting over her initial fright, Kirsty uploaded the photos to Facebook and Tumblr and they quickly went viral - with hundreds of internet users deeming them 'hilarious'.

Cover your mouth! Kirsty then covers her mouth and bursts into giggles, while her friend continues to scream

It's quite funny, actually! Despite their fear, the girls continue to lie on the bed - and even keep snapping selfies

Today, Kirsty told MailOnline she had been 'extremely scared' when she had first spotted the spider.

'I had no idea what to do so I basically just froze,' she said. 'The photos were taken over the course of about five seconds and I was waiting for Jair's reaction to see if the spider was real.

'But Jair had, in fact, set me up and played along with it. The toy spider was lying around her house so she thought she'd prank me with it.

'She told me after the last picture and we looked back at the pictures and laughed so much, so I decided to put them on Tumblr.

Gotcha! Jair later revealed to Kirsty that the spider was actually a fake arachnid that she had planted on the bed in a bid to scare her friend. The girls then uploaded the photos online and they quickly went viral

'The fact that they went viral in a matter of a week was extraordinary and I couldn't believe it was happening.'

She added: 'Jair and I found it funny because we never expected this sort of thing to happen to us!'

Kirsty later took to Twitter to share her shock at the reaction, tweeting: 'HAHAHAHAHAHA ME AND JAIR ARE THE INTERNET (sic)'.
