The three young men who were last seen with a 20-year-old girl who disappeared after a late night of partying are now going on the offensive, saying that the girl's parents are harassing them for information about their daughter's whereabouts.

Lauren Spierer, 20, vanished on June 3, 2011, following a night out with friends in downtown Bloomington, Indiana. There has been no sign of the young blonde woman for two years as her family have struggled with false leads and what they allege is a pact of silence among her friends. 

Now one of the young men who is seen carrying her out of a restaurant towards his house is saying that the Spierers are harassing him by repeatedly calling him demanding information that he claims he does not have.

Missing: Indiana University student Lauren Spierer, 19, disappeared from Bloomington, Indiana, in June 2011. Police have few clues about her whereabouts

'We’ve done nothing wrong. If we’d done something wrong, we would have been arrested already. All they’re doing is hurting my career,' said one of those men, Corey Rossman.

'It’s inappropriate the way they’re harassing people that are also victims in this case,' he told The Indianapolis Star.

Rossman told the paper that he has had 
to field phone calls from reporters, the Spierer's lawyers, and the 
Spierers themselves, though the parents deny that they ever called the 
young men themselves.

Questions: The three young men last seen with Lauren refuse to cooperate with authorities

'Rob and I have never spoken to Corey Rossman,' Lauren's mother Charlene said to the paper.

'The private investigators have never spoken to Corey. So I don’t know how it is we’re harassing him other than asking him to talk to the Bloomington police department. All of them.'

Rossman is involved in the case is 
because he accompanied Lauren to a bar, and then back to her apartment 
at a building called Smallwood Plaza. While there, he was punched in the
face by another student.

His
lawyer has previously said that Rossman does not remember anything 
after the punch, but the building's surveillance footage shows Rossman 
helping Spierer out of the building in the direction of his own 
apartment.

Rossman, his roommate Mike Beth, and their neighbor Jay Rosenbaum are the final three people to see her alive.

The
article in the Indianapolis Star paints Rossman as defensive, as he 
said the following when a reporter called him at work: 'What do you 
think, I’m doing drugs now? No, I’m at work. Don’t ever call again. If 
you contact me again, you’re going to hear from my lawyer. Either way, 
you’re going to hear from my lawyer.'

Her parents spoke out last spring, when their daughter was meant to be graduating.

'We’re experiencing a terrible strain.We miss Lauren terribly and the not 
knowing makes it all the worse for us.,' her father Robert said at the time.

Seeking answers: This surveillance photo is the last known image of Lauren. Several of the people to see her last have hired lawyers and stopped fully cooperating

Desperate search: Charlene Spierer, left, has kept the pressure on in the hunt for her missing daughter Lauren

'We think about her every day and 
we talk about her every day. It’s not any easier today than it was two 
years ago.'

No arrests have been made in relation to the young woman's disappearance.

Human
remains were recently found in a remote area of Indiana causing the 
Spierer family further fears. Autopsy results are expected next week.

The
search for Lauren has taken one frustrating turn after another. When 
the investigation began, five of her male friends, who police believed 
could have offered insight into the final moments before her 
disappearance hired criminal defense lawyers and stopped fully 
cooperating with police.

Speaking on Couric’s daytime talk show in December, Lauren’s parents said that their daughter’s friends are impeding the search for her. They hypothesized that the friends have made a pact of silence.

‘Despite their claims of doing whatever they could do, the fact of the matter is they refuse to meet with us…they refuse to take a police polygraph, which we feel is important for a number of reasons,’ Mr Spierer said.

The television host also asked Lauren’s still-devastated mother if, more than a year after her daughter’s disappearance, she had any theories as to who might have taken her.

‘Our biggest dilemma is not knowing if it was a random abduction or if it was someone that Lauren knew,’ Charlene Spierer told Couric.

Stonewalled: Lauren Spierer's parents, Robert and Charlene Spierer spoke with Katie Couric about their daughter's disappearance

She added that she now believes it to be someone who knew her daughter, based in part because of the lack of cooperation she and her husband have received from Lauren’s university friends.

In Bloomington, a quiet college town that is known as one of the safest cities in America, the scars of Lauren's disappearance are visible even a year and a half later.

Her smiling face is visible on posters plastered on street corners, hung around the campus and posted in nearly every bar, restaurant and shop downtown.

Mr Spierer added that while he and his wife now think their daughter is dead, they still cling to hope. ‘I understand that Lauren may no longer be with us,’ he said.

'We ache for her. We want to bring her home.’
