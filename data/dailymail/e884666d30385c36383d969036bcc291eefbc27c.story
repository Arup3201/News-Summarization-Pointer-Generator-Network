It's every parent's worst nightmare: A horrified mother watched helplessly as her toddler slipped through the gap between the carriage and the platform, falling underneath a train seconds from departing a station in Melbourne's north last Friday.

Reacting instantly, the panicked woman got down on all fours to try and retrieve her little girl from beneath the train, calling for help as bystanders rushed to her aid.

A mother scrambled to reach her little girl who slipped out of her arms and underneath a train at a Melbourne station last Friday

Passengers on the platform at Reservoir station, desperately tried to notify the driver while many others stooped down to help the mother save her two or three year old  

CCTV footage from the platform at Reservoir station shows the woman coming off the train's carriage while pushing a stroller in front of her at 4.20pm.

In a split second her toddler, who looks between two and three years old, fell straight through the gap between the train and the platform.

Miraculously, the toddler escaped unharmed when dozens of passengers - both on and off the train - desperately tried to alert the driver and the train station staff.

Passengers crowded around the woman as she lifted out her child, who was miraculously unhurt in the ordeal

The footage shows travelers swarming around the mother, with many dropping to the floor to help save the child.

Metro spokeswoman Larissa Tait told the Herald Sun that the mother and daughter were offered first aid and an ambulance, but refused the offers as the infant was unharmed.

'The driver was notified immediately, who then informed our central control room of the incident, and our station staff were promptly in attendance on the platform,' Ms Tait said.

'It was a fantastic response by our station staff and our customers on the platform and train. We commend the customers who rendered assistance alerting the driver and lifting the little girl back on to the platform.'

Ms Tait asked parent's to remain vigilant when traveling with children, insisting that they ensure they hold their child's hands when boarding and exiting trains.
