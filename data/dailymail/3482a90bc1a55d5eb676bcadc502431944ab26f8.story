A commercial air pilot was rushed to the hospital on Saturday after a smuggled balloon of cocaine burst in his stomach during a 5-hour flight.

Pilot Stanley Rafael Hill of McKinney, Texas was a passenger on the flight from Colombia to Houston and had to call 911 right after he landed and checked into a hotel.

The 49-year-old was still recovering at Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital on Tuesday, passing the rest of the cocaine bags.

Pilot Stanley Rafael Hill continues to pass the rest of the 62 bags of cocaine at Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital. He was rushed to the hospital on Saturday after one of the cocaine bags he was smuggling exploded in his stomach

According to Click 2 Houston, Hill ingested a total of 62 bags of cocaine packaged with rubber gloves.

Smuggling the drugs may have been easier since pilots are not subject to the same cavity checks as regular passengers.

A source close to the investigation told the new station that one of the bags exploded in Hill's stomach during the flight, but he was only able to call for help once he landed.

He has been charged with felony possession of drugs with intent to deliver, and police have been barricading him in his room at the hospital.

It's unclear what airline Hill was flying, or which carrier he works for. He is licensed to fly 737s.

Bond has been set at $500,000.

Authorities say Hill ingested 62 balloons of cocaine. Above an evidence photo of cocaine bags from 2000, an unrelated case
