No stranger to courting controversy, Rush Limbaugh has suggested rapper Kanye West would have a hit record if he recorded the same racist chant that cost the SAE fraternity its University of Oklahoma house.

Speaking about Sigma Alpha Epsilon's slurs on Wednesday's show, Limbaugh dragged the Grammy-winning rapper into his monologue and claimed hip-hop shared the blame for capitalizing on the N-word in so many lyrics.

'If this had been a song by Kim Kardashian's husband, and they'd sung this song at the Grammys, this would be a hit. Can we all agree with that?' he asked. 

Rush Limbaugh believes a racist chant that cost a fraternity its University of Oklahoma campus house 'would be a hit' if it was a Kanye West record

Limbaugh told his audience: 'If this had been a song by Kim Kardashian's husband, and they'd sung this song at the Grammys, this would be a hit. Can we all agree with that?'

As The Daily News notes, Limbaugh's rant came after mentioning MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski's controversial Twitter post that wondered if the fraternity had learned the word from listening to hip-hop.

'I'm telling you that this stuff gets awards and the people that sing it are portrayed as American royalty in terms of celebrity. You can't deny that,' Limbaugh said. 

But on Twitter few thought Rush was right. 

'...sickened by Joe Scarborough and Rush Limbaugh thinking hip-hop the cause of already-racist frat boys,' wrote Twitter user Terry McCarty in Los Angeles.

'WE DON’T EVEN LIKE KANYE RIGHT NOW SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,' joked blogger Xavier D'Leau.

Twitter users mocked Rush's claim after the show aired

Some were even outraged over his insinuation

As news broke of the Oklahoma University SAE freshman chanting 'there will never be a n***** in SAE' on a bus from the campus in Norman to the Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club, the university's president David Boren closed the campus fraternity.

Following a swift investigation, he expelled the two ringleaders behind the song and said: 'I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma. I hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country.'

Privately educated freshman Parker Rice, 19, and his sophomore friend Levi Pettit, 20, both from Dallas, expressed regret in the respective apologies as they accepted the expulsion but refused to explain who taught them the racist chant.
