Two-year-old Sophie Jones died after digesting the heroin substitute 

A two-year-old girl died after drinking her drug addict parents' methadone which was kept in Tom and Jerry cups and Fruit Shoot bottles, a court has heard.

Sophie Jones was found covered in vomit by paramedics at her parents home in Blackpool in March after digesting the heroin-substitute. 

She was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead less than an hour later after digesting the lethal substance, Preston Crown Court heard.

Her parents Michelle King, 29, who was also allegedly selling the substance, admitted manslaughter.

Her partner, 41-year-old Barry Jones, denies the offence and is standing trial.

The court was told King, a known heroin addict, began selling her prescribed dosage of methadone instead of taking it herself, storing the lethal substance in children's cups and Fruit Shoot bottles.

She would use the money to buy other drugs including cocaine, traces of which were found on the toddler's dummy during tests following her death. 

Prosecuting Jeremy Grout-Smith said: 'Both parents have been users of heroin and crack cocaine for some years and were habitually taking these drugs at the time of Sophie's death.

'Michelle King was prescribed methadone, which is heroin replacement.

'Sophie died from drinking the methadone, which she drank from a child's plastic drinking cup.

'She died because of the carelessness and neglect of her parents.

'The risk of the contamination that took place must have been obvious.'

At around 11.40pm on March 4 Jones phoned an ambulance telling operators his daughter had stopped breathing. 

Three minutes later paramedics arrived to find the toddler lying on the floor, covered in vomit.

The toddler's parents Michelle King (left) and Barry Jones (right) allegedly knew she was unwell and tried to cover up the fact she had ingested methadone before police searched their home, the court heard 

Paramedics arrived at the couple's home to find two-year-old Sophie 'covered in vomit' and 'unresponsive' 

'There was vomit in her hair, on her face, chest and on the floor that appeared to contain blood.

'Paramedics thought she was already dead,' Mr Grout-Smith said.

Earlier that day King's mother had visited the family and noticed Sophie being 'unsteady on her feet'.

She allegedly told her daughter, 'I hope you haven't left the lid off your tablets.'

'Jean saw Sophie fall at least once while she was at the house.

'She was concerned about Sophie and thought they should call an ambulance.

'They told her they would take Sophie to the medical centre later that day.

'After they had left, Jones phoned his mother and told her they had taken Sophie to the centre but that was untrue.

'They both knew she was unwell because of the drug she had taken and they knew that would be diagnosed by medical staff.

'They knew they were at fault.

'They were both aware that Sophie had been put into a deep slumber,' Mr Grout Smith added. 

The toddler's mother sent a series of text messages to another drug user reminding her that she was owed £25 on the day of her child's death, it was alleged.  

King, a known heroin addict, was selling her prescribed dosage of methadone to other addicts when her child died, the court heard 

Traces of cocaine were also allegedly found on the toddler's dummy following an examination of the couple's home

The court heard how the child's grandmother visited the day before her death and noted she looked unstable 

A quantity of methadone was found in the couple's back garden when police searched the property 

After their daughter was pronounced dead, the couple told police they feared she had drank cider that her grandmother's partner had brought to the house.

King allegedly sent a text message to her partner following their daughter's death telling him to dispose of 'all the meth bottles out back under green thing.

Another said 'don't tip meth out hide it', the court heard.

'Prior to the 999 call made at 11:40 there had also been an attempt to clear the house of incriminating evidence - the child's drinking cup with methadone and had been put under a sheet in the backyard of the house, bins with shoot bottles in have been moved outside from the back of the house to the end of the street away from their house. 

'The neighbour noticed that the water running the upstairs sink for significant period of time.

'It must've been a joint attempt by both defendants to clear up the house. They were acting together to clear the house of any incriminating evidence they were both aware she had been put into a deep slumber had not woken up - they needed to protect themselves.

'It is significant there were no phone calls for a period of one hour between 10:45 and the 999 call at 11:40. In the context of the usual use of phone it was an unusual silent,' Mr Grout-Smith added.  

Tests later showed Sophie had traces of four separate drugs in her hair. Three of her dummies had traces of cocaine powder on the teat. Methadone was also found on an upstairs bathroom sink. 

Officer searching the couple's home discovered 146ml of the heroin substitute in their back garden. Just 5ml of the substance is enough to harm a child of Sophie's age, the court heard.

High traces of methadone were found in the child's blood following a post-mortem examination. As none was found in her stomach, pathologists suggested she had digested the substance by the time of her death.

She died from poisoning by methadone which led her to fall unconscious and inhale the stomach's contents into her lungs. 

The trial continues.
