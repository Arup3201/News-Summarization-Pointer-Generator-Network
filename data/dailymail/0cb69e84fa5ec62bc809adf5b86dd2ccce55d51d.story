Deborah Ballard (pictured with her husband, Guy), 53, had a stroke in February and another mini-stroke on Sunday after which she noticed her voice had changed

A stroke victim was left in shock after waking up to find she was speaking in a Welsh accent.

Deborah Ballard, 53, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, only realised she was suffering with foreign accent syndrome - where people's voices can change following trauma - when she was calling in her pets from the garden.

Mrs Ballard suffered a stroke in February and a transient ischaemic attack - known as a mini stroke - on Sunday when she was at her job as a senior care assistant.

She said: 'It wasn't until I called the animals in that I realised my voice had changed.â€™

The grandmother, who was born in London and grew up in Kent, said her son initially thought she was joking when he heard her.

She said she couldn't put her finger on where her new accent was from but that friends and family said she sounded Welsh.

She said: 'I texted my husband and told him not to be surprised when he came home as I had a bit of an accent.

'I got a bit embarrassed about it at first but everybody who has heard me said they think it's sweet.

'I spoke to the doctor about it and he said as long as I'm not in pain everything should be alright.

'I must admit when I was talking I was looking in the mirror and talking to myself, I was trying to work it out and was getting a bit upset.'

Despite the change, Mrs Ballard is remaining positive and says she actually thinks the new accent is quite nice.

She added: 'I kept putting my fingers in my ears trying to hear my own voice.

'I was trying to get my normal voice back, I was coughing.

'I realised I was speaking with an accent, and I knew it was serious.

'I did cry and get down initially but I think it could have been worse at least I still have my speech and the use of my body.'

Mrs Ballard said she was initially embarrassed about the accent but that she feels better about it now as people have told her it is 'sweet'. She is thought to have developed foreign accent syndrome

Mrs Ballard, who is on medication for the stroke and a knee operation she had in August, is due to attend the stroke unit today.

She said: 'I am trying not to let it get me down now, I am trying to take each day as it comes and take nothing for granted.

'A lot of people get down about strokes but I am trying to show that you don't have to be.

'I have a supportive family and think I have come out of my stroke really well.'

Foreign accent syndrome is a medical condition in which patients develop what appears to be a foreign accent.

It usually results from a stroke but can also develop from head trauma.

Last month a woman from Plymouth hit the headlines after she developed a Chinese accent.

Foreign accent syndrome is a very rare condition that results from damage to the speech centres of the brain.

It makes the sufferer sound as though they have a foreign accent.

It does not enable them to speak a language they did not previously know.

Strokes are the most common cause of the syndrome but it can also result from a head trauma.
