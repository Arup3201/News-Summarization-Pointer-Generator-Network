Alastair Cook fell cheaply for the second time in the match for MCC against county champions Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi.

Cook, who made just three in the first innings, mustered five at his second attempt on Tuesday morning before his attempt to dispatch a short ball from Jack Brooks went straight into the hands of Adil Rashid at midwicket.

The England Test captain will next week depart for his first assignment of this Ashes year - to take on the West Indies in the Caribbean.

But he will do so on the back of two failures in his only two first-class innings since last season.

Cook caused a stir last week when he described England's decision to replace him as their World Cup captain as 'probably wrong', in hindsight.

The opener continued his poor form in a one-day international series in Sri Lanka late last year, and England responded by dropping him in favour of Eoin Morgan.

They went on, however, to make an embarrassing early exit from the global tournament in Australia and New Zealand - beating only minnows Scotland and Afghanistan, and eliminated by a defeat against Bangladesh.

Cook agreed to play for MCC against Yorkshire at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, in the traditional curtain-raiser for the new season.

But there has been no return to form for England's most prolific Test centurion - who is without an international hundred in any format since May 2013.

MCC were in a spot of bother too after his early dismissal, on 30 for one and still needing another 121 runs merely to avoid an innings defeat.
