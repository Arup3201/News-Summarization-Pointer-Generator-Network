A man is being called a hero after saving the life of a teenaged girl who fell on the tracks from a crowded New York subway platform during rush hour Wednesday.

Joshua Garcia, who works in food service at New York University, was waiting for a train around 6:45pm when he saw Stephanie Xue, 16, begin to sway near the platform edge at Union Square station.

Father-of-three Garcia sprang into action when the girl fainted and fell onto the tracks and the people surrounding her made no move to help.

'She was 
leaning over the platform like she was woozy from medication, and then I
 saw her fall and I was like, "Oh s**t!,"' Garcia told DNA Info.

Although
 he was about 50 feet from Xue, Garcia pushed through the apathetic 
crowd and without hesitating, jumped onto the tracks to rescue the girl,
 whose body was lying diagonally across the tracks.

Garcia hoisted the petite five-foot four-inch teen above his head.

Xue had a deep, six-inch wound across the side of her head.

'You could see her skull,' Garcia told DNA Info. 'It was terrifying to look at.'

Even more upsetting, Garcia says, were the reactions of his fellow commuters.

As he attempted to deposit Xue safely on the platform, he looked up to see that most people on the platform were either taking videos or pictures of the incident with their cell phones.

'It was amazing seeing all these people doing nothing,' he said. 'It was an eye-opener.'

Thankfully, one member of the crowd was moved to help. Justine Omilig, 23, a nursing student at Philips Beth Israel, ran over and helped stem the bleed from Xue's head would with a wad of tissues.

Together, Garcia and Omilig kept the terrified teenager conscious and talking until an ambulance arrived.

Doctors at Bellevue Hospital needed 50 stitches to close the gash on Xue's head.

She can't remember much about the ordeal.

'I remember I started to feel dizzy and I just blacked out, and then I woke up and Joshua was helping support my neck and this woman was applying pressure to my wound,' Xue told DNA Info.

She says she is deeply grateful to Garcia for his actions that day when she was in need.

'There is a lot I want to say, but it is hard to find the words,' Xue said. 'I am just so thankful he was there to help me.'

For his part, Garcia refused to acknowledge there was anything heroic about his rescue.

'I give all the glory to Lord Jesus,' Garcia told DNA Info. 'I was glad to help and to show her that there are good people out there.'
