Spring clean: Amanda was impressed with Aldi's washing up liquid

When it comes to cleaning products, it takes a lot to persuade us away from Dettol, Domestos and Febreze. But last week Lidl's dishwasher tablets beat the brand favourite Finish in a consumer test.

So which other own-label cleaning products are as good as the big names? AMANDA CABLE pulled on her rubber gloves to find out...

BIG NAME: Fairy Liquid Original, £1.50 for 530ml

BEST OWN BRAND: Aldi Magnum, 59p for 500ml

VERDICT: I put them through their paces with plates that had contained lasagne, greasy roasting trays and even the dog bowls. Aldi offers the biggest bubbles, most effective wash and best value.

A plain green liquid with no added frills such as perfume or moisturiser, which can mean more money has been spent on the cleaning ingredients themselves. In 2011, Which? found that a 59p bottle of Magnum will wash 11,750 plates.

I couldn't face testing this out to the last dish - but I DID squirt Magnum into a bowl of dishes next to an identical bowl of dishes and Fairy. Eight hours later, the Magnum bubbles were still there, beating Fairy.

SAVING PER ITEM: 91p (though you get 30ml more Fairy)

ALSO TRY: The Co-operative Simply Value Washing Up Liquid, 35 pence for 500ml - much cheaper but bubbles don’t last quite as long.

BIG NAME: Dettol Surface Cleanser Spray, £2 for 500ml

BEST OWN BRAND: Sainsbury’s antibacterial multi-surface spray, £1.35 for 500ml

VERDICT: I swear by Dettol, and found many own brands tended to foam when squirted, but the Sainsbury's version squirted strongly to reach corners and cleaned muddy dog paws on skirting boards with ease. No smearing, no mess left - but a saving of £2.60 a month, if you get through a bottle a week like I do.

SAVING PER ITEM: 65p

ALSO TRY: Tesco Antibacterial Cleaner Spray with Byotrol, £1.30 for 500ml - it just slightly lacks the Sainsbury's power.

Budget buy: Our writer could save £2.60 a month by switching to Sainsbury's surface cleaner instead of Dettol

BIG NAME: Finish Quantum Lemon Sparkle Dishwaster Tablets (30 pack), £12

BEST OWN BRAND: Asda Citrus Burst All in 1 Dishwasher Tablets (30 pack), £3.50

VERDICT: The success of Lidl's own-brand dishwasher tablets made headline news when they scooped a Which? Best Buy awards, beating my usual brand Finish. I was stunned to find that Asda's All-in-1 dishwasher tablets - which cost a quarter of the price of the market leaders - are also just as good.

After a tough roast dinner, I could spot my reflection in every piece of silver cutlery, and even my glasses were shining - all for 11p per tablet.

SAVING PER ITEM: £8.50

ALSO TRY: Lidl W5 All-in-1 Dishwasher tablets, £3.99 for 40 - or 10p per wash.

BIG NAME: Lord Sheraton Caretaker Furniture Polish, £1.58 for 300ml

BEST OWN BRAND: Asda Multi Surface Furniture Polish, 80p for 300ml

VERDICT: Big-name polish brands actually oil the wood, as well as polishing it - and none of the cheaper own brands manage to do this. But a friend who cleans for a famous museum in London, which boasts oak panelled walls and ornate antique wooden furniture swears by the Asda alternative.

So I happily tried this 80p spray on my own maple kitchen units and oak dining table. There's no smearing or sticky residue and it collects the dust well. Use most days, and save your big name brands for a once a month super-shine.

SAVING PER ITEM: 78p

ALSO TRY: Morrisons Classic Furniture Polish, 80p for 250ml - same price as Asda, just slightly less in the can. 

Can't tell the difference: Asda's toilet roll was as soft and strong as Andrex

BIG NAME: Andrex Classic White Roll (four rolls) £2.10

BEST OWN BRAND: Asda Shades (four rolls) £1.78

VERDICT: There’s
 been a huge variation in quality of budget toilet paper in the past, 
and some - such as the Co-operative own brand which is rough and cheap -
 are still really inferior.

But
 others are working hard to match the market leaders. I can't tell the 
difference between my usual Andrex and the cheaper Asda alternative, 
which is just as soft and strong.

There
 aren't great savings here - in upping the quality of their budget roll,
 supermarkets have also increased the price. But the average person uses
 30 toilet rolls a year, which means for a family of five, 150 rolls at 
year. So any saving - even just 32p per packet of four - is a bonus.

SAVING PER ITEM: 32 pence

ALSO TRY: Waitrose
 Pure White toilet roll (4 rolls) £1.80 - also marvellous quality, and 
nobody will realise it is a cash-saving alternative to Andrex.

BIG NAME: Domestos Thick Bleach, £1.25 for 750ml

BEST OWN BRAND: Lidl W5 Thick Bleach, 55p for 750ml

VERDICT: Lidl won a Good Housekeeping accreditation in 2013 for its bleach. Famous brands like Domestos ARE better at sticking to the sides of the toilet and sink, cleaning for longer. Our own brand alternatives are slightly thinner, but clean almost as well.

I get through a bottle of bleach a week cleaning up after a family of five - so if I switch to Lidl I save £2.80 a month. A big saving for a slight difference in quality.

SAVING PER ITEM: 70p

ALSO TRY: Morrisons M Original Bleach, 75p for 750ml — Morrisons is working hard on its own brands: the results are terrific.

BIG NAME: Cif Cream Lemon Fresh, £2.50 for 500ml

BEST OWN BRAND: Lidl W5 Cream Cleaner Lemon Fresh, 99p for 750ml

VERDICT: I used Lidl's cream to clean the bath and sink, but found it needs more rinsing than big brand name Cif. I noticed there was a difference here — pay more, and you save yourself the extra work. All of our own budget brand cream cleaners required more elbow grease than the big name brands. A switch not worth making, in my opinion.

SAVING PER ITEM: £1.51 (though you get more Lidl cleaner)

ALSO TRY: Sainsbury's cream cleaner, 80p for 750ml - a good budget alternative.

Scrubbing up well: Asda floor cleaner was almost as good as Cif

BIG NAME: Cif Ocean All Purpose Floor Cleaner Liquid, £2.50 for 1 litre

BEST OWN BRAND: Asda Smartprice All Purpose Liquid Cleaner, 25p for 1 litre

VERDICT: The arrival of two dogs has made my life - and my floor - very messy. I get through a bottle of floor cleaner each week, which costs me £52 a year for my usual brand, Cif.

But a simple switch to Asda’s budget Liquid Cleaner gives me a massive 90 per cent saving.  It wasn't too runny and didn't smell cheap and nasty, and cleaned almost as well.

SAVING PER ITEM: 2.25p

ALSO TRY: Sainsbury's Floor Cleaner, £1.40 for 1 litre.

BIG NAME: Persil Powder, £12 for 4.25kg

OWN BRAND: Lidl Formil Washing Powder (Colour/2-in-1/non bio), £6.19 for 4.875kg

VERDICT: My favourite brand Persil costs 24p per wash - and is worth every penny. The colour doesn't run and despite his sensitive skin, my son Charlie doesn't get a rash.

I know from bitter experience that cheaper powders contain cheaper ingredients and are more likely to irritate skin. Cheaper powder doesn’t rinse as well and can leave white powder marks on your clothes in a coloured wash.

But the fantastic Lidl powder costs just 12p per wash and brings none of my children up in a rash. There's no cheap after-smell, and when I tried it on muddy PE kit on a 40 degree wash, it worked wonders. I run two washes a day - so this makes a massive difference to my housekeeping budget. A winner.

SAVING PER ITEM: £5.81

ALSO TRY: Sainbury’s 2-in-1 Washing Powder, £5 for 4kg - nice fragrance. Great for towels and sheets.

BIG NAME: Vanish Stain Remover Powder for Colours £4.60 for 500g

BEST OWN BRAND: Sainsbury’s Stain Remover Powder for Colours £2.49 for 500g

Half price: Sainsbury's stain remover does the job and is cheaper than Vanish

VERDICT: Anybody with a football-playing husband and equally muddy dogs requires a jar of stain remover.

Vanish
 has always worked brilliantly for me, but with a hefty price tag of 
£4.60. I was thrilled to find that the cut-price Sainsbury version, 
which is an astonishing £2.11 cheaper - performs just  as well.

SAVING PER ITEM: £2.11

ALSO TRY: Aldi Almat Stain lift, £2.39 for 2kg

BIG NAME: Lenor Fabric Conditioner, £2.20 for 750ml

BEST OWN BRAND: Waitrose Meadow Fabric Conditioner, £1.25 for 750ml

VERDICT: Big name brands such as Lenor and Comfort are thicker than the own brand alternatives. Cheaper fabric conditioners don't leave a long lasting smell, but they soften clothes just as well. I found myself using a tiny bit more - so in the long run, won't always pay.

My pick of the own brands, though, is the Waitrose 'Meadow' fabric conditioner - a truly gorgeous and fresh smell.

SAVING PER ITEM: 95p

ALSO TRY: Asda Moonflower & Ylang Fabric Conditioner, £1.20 for 750ml - Asda really have got their fragrances spot on. This is simply delicious.

Big savings: Amanda found the cheaper products were worth buying

QUALITY: Cif Easy Life Bathroom Cleaner Spray,  £2.98 for  750ml

BEST OWN BRAND: Sainsbury's Bathroom Cleaner with trigger spray, £1.25 for 500ml.

VERDICT: Be careful with cheaper spray cleaners. I squirted a Waitrose cleaner into the corner of the shower unit, and some of the foam flew out, bleaching my T-shirt in the process. Sainsbury's own brand trigger bottles don’t compromise on quality at all, cleaning beautifully - and this one was even cheaper than the equally impressive Asda version.

SAVING PER ITEM: £1.73 (though you get 250ml more Cif)

ALSO TRY: Asda Bathroom Cleaner Spray,  £1.50 for 750ml - no smears here, despite the price.
