Four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and an Mi-24 helicopter gunship shot down as Kiev's government leaders claimed they were now engaged in 'war' with pro-Russian forces.  

At least 30 troops were also wounded in fierce clashes around Sloviansk, epicentre of the unrest in Ukraine's east, amid accusations insurgents were shooting from apartment blocks and using civilians as human shields.  

A number of civilians were injured as there appeared to be no let-up in Ukraine's alarming bloodshed even as the first funerals were held for victims burned to death in Odessa's fire massacre.

The latest flashpoints came as Russia warned that peace on the European continent is now threatened by the deepening crisis, a situation it blames entirely on the new political rulers in Kiev and their Western supporters.  

But there is increasing evidence of a political bandwagon running in Moscow pressing Vladimir Putin to send tanks into Ukraine to protect pro-Russian citizens from what is seen as attack by a fascist-led government in Kiev.  

The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said the unrest was now 'fraught with such destructive consequences for Europe's peace, stability and democratic development that it is absolutely necessary to prevent it'.

Supervising the assault on pro-Moscow insurgents in Sloviansk, Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov hit back: 'They are waging a war on us, on our own territory. My mission is to eliminate the terrorists.'  

And interim president Oleksandr Turchynov warned of new Russian provocations which could erupt on Friday in the wake of commemorations of the defeat of the Nazis in 1945.

'War is in effect being waged against us, and we must be ready to repel this aggression,' he said.  

The head of Ukraine's national guard, Stepan Poltorak, said 800 well-armed insurgents were surrounded in Sloviansk.

At least three people were killed and several were injured in clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in the eastern city of Sloviansk

'We have bottled them up in the centre', he said.  

Russia claimed an 'humanitarian disaster is brewing' here and in other towns encircled by Ukrainian troops with medicine and food shortages.   

In Moscow, two party leaders in the Russian parliament demanded military action in Ukraine, the West's worst nightmare.  

Sergey Mironov, leader of mainstream the Just Russia party demanded: 'Fascist scoundrels must be crushed in their own nests. We need to get troops there to defend our brothers.'

Vladimir Putin has signed a law banning swearing in films, television broadcasts, theatres and the media.

And books which contain swear words will have to carry warnings on the cover.

Breaking the law – in force from July 1 – will incur a fine of £800 for organisations and £40 for individuals.

It is seen as a throwback to Communist rule, when artists and writers were told to avoid 'decadent Western fashions'.

Vladimir Zhirinovsky, founded of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party, called for military action ahead of Firday's commemoration known as Victory Day.

'Then the country will breathe freely - and can celebrate another victory,' he said.  

The strongman Chechen leader joined the chorus declaring he was 'sure' Putin 'will take measures to protect civilians in the Sloviansk and other cities of Ukraine'.  

With tens of thousands of Russian soldiers close to the Ukrainian frontier, he  warned: 'We cannot sit back and watch when civilians are killed.'

Putin's spokesman claimed the West lacked sanity in its approach to the crisis. 'We do not see that Europe and the US are sane in their assessments,' said Dmitry Peskov.

The Kremlin also said a new Russian report shows 'grave violations of fundamental principles and norms in the sphere of human rights in Ukraine have acquired a mass scale'.

The protestations from Moscow increased Western concerns that Russia is seeking pretexts for deploying troops, possible to ensure referendums take place on Sunday in Donetsk and Lugansk aimed at the regions seceding.

The report alleged pro-Kiev protesters wore NATO 'military gear' and that some protesters were wounded by 'NATO ammunition'.

Moscow has hugely boosted its military air power in Crimea, and deployed strategic jets and fighter bombers, say experts.  

Meanwhile, in the Russian-annexed region, a senior Tatar Muslim leader Mustafa Dzhemilev has been silenced.

Crimea's pro-Moscow leader alleged: 'There are no doubts that this man has been tasked by Western special services with destabilising the situation.'
