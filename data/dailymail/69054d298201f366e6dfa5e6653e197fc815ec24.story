A caravan park has converted a grounded helicopter into a quirky holiday home which can sleep up to four people. 

The aircraft was bought by bosses at Ream Hills Holiday Park in Preston, Lancashire, and redesigned to become fit for a family holiday. 

The helicopter, a 1977 Westland Lynx XZ262, is one of nine which belong to the company's director, but is the only one to have been converted.

A holiday park has converted a grounded helicopter into a cosy accommodation rental for up to four people

For £100 a night families can enjoy the tiny kitchen and television installed in the 40-year-old aircraft 

Rates begin at £100 a night with guests given the choice of sleeping in a double bed at the back of the aircraft or on a pull out bed.

It comes with its own compact kitchen with a microwave, sink and has running water. 

A plinth heater and roof ventilation have also been installed to keep guests warm with a television installed in place of the pilot's seat. 

'In the main section, where the two sliding doors would normally be, we have had the floor lowered and there is a pull-down double bed,' said Sarah Gerrard, a manager at the park. 

'It's two bunks at the minute and it forms a settee. There's a microwave and a sink, from our point of view it's like staying in a tent.'

Guests have access to communal toilets and showers used by other campers at the park. 

Westland Lynx helicopters are still used by the Navy and are described as 'the backbone' of the Fleet Air Arm. 

Models were flown during the Falklands and Gulf Wars with enough space to carry a Royal Marines boarding team. 

The helicopter, a 1977 Westland Lynx XZ262, is one of nine owned by the holiday park's director
