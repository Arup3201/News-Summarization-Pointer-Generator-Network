Ed Miliband pitched Labour into disarray on the economy and welfare yesterday when he was unable to answer basic questions about his party’s policies.

The Labour leader’s performance in a radio interview was described as ‘a car crash’ and ‘a Milishambles’.

Mr Miliband refused on ten occasions to admit that his party would increase government borrowing, despite outlining plans that would require more than £28billion of borrowing.

He then revealed that Labour’s policy review would investigate whether 
to axe universal benefits for pensioners such as the winter fuel 
allowance and free bus and television licences.

His aides were later forced to insist that they would stay.

The Labour leader lost his temper in an interview with Martha Kearney, host of Radio 4’s World at One.

At one point, he snapped ‘You don’t understand’ to Miss Kearney as she 
pressed him on Labour’s position on the economy – while failing to spell
 out what it is.

The interview came as Mr Miliband unveiled Labour’s alternative Queen’s 
Speech, which repeated the party’s pledge to bring in a temporary VAT 
cut to 17.5 per cent, which would cost £13 billion. 

Labour published an Alternative Queen's Speech today, but the Tories suggested it contained £28.1billion in unfunded spending promises

It also outlined 
pledges to reintroduce the 10p tax rate, at a cost of £7.3billion paid 
for with a mansion tax that would only raise £2billion. The Tories claim
 there is a £28billion black hole in the plans.

Borrowing fell only slightly last year to £120.6billion, just £300million lower than in 2011-12.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has previously admitted that Labour would 
have to raise borrowing in an attempt to foster economic growth, in the 
hope that means borrowing can be cut later. But Mr Miliband flatly 
refused to admit that borrowing would increase, angrily dodging ten 
different questions on the subject.

Asked whether he thinks the Government needs to borrow more now, Mr 
Miliband said: ‘No, well [what] I would say is that we need to get 
borrowing down.’

Pressed again, he added: ‘I don’t accept that borrowing
 would be higher under a Labour government because borrowing would be 
lower over the medium term.’

Asked to agree with Mr Balls that borrowing would rise in the short-term he refused.

Tory MP Brooks Newmark branded Mr Miliband’s performance ‘a 
Milishambles’, while the Liberal Democrat press office tweeted that it 
was ‘a car crash’.

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed Miliband is too weak to admit
 what his Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, has already said: that Labour’s 
plans mean more spending, more borrowing and more debt, exactly how 
Labour got us into this mess in the first place.’

The grilling of Ed Miliband by Radio 4’s World at One presenter Martha Kearney was described as a ‘car crash’ interview. Here is an edited transcript:MK: Would it be fair to say, looking at your plans overall, that you think that the Government needs to borrow more now and that’s in order to boost growth in the economy.EM: No, well [what] I would say is that we need to get borrowing down.MK: In order to produce more growth, if you were PM at the moment you would be spending and borrowing more wouldn’t you? EM: Well I don’t accept that borrowing would be higher under Labour… because borrowing would be lower over the medium term.MK: When Ed Balls was asked about this very question he was more open. He answered it. When he was asked if he would borrow more if he were chancellor he said now and I quote ‘that is what I would do right now’.EM: Look the Government is cutting too far and too fast. Ed Balls is absolutely right about that.MK: All I am asking you is to explain how you are going to boost growth and that is by spending more and that is by borrowing more if you were PM at the moment, straight answer to that? EM: Well I am giving you a very straight answer. I think borrowing would be lower under a Labour government over the medium term.MK: In the medium term, but I am asking you what you would do right now? If I made you PM right now.EM: What we would do right now is the five-point plan for growth and jobs. A VAT cut which I think would get our economy moving.MK: [That] Wouldn’t contribute to growth tomorrow. If you were PM now cut VAT for a year you are going to spend £12billion and you hope you will get the money back in the medium term but you don’t know that. So you will have to borrow more wouldn’t you?EM: No you don’t understand Martha, I don’t think you are quite accepting this point. Why has George Osborne’s borrowing gone from nought to £61billion? Why do you think that is? MK: I’m asking you about your plans....EM: No, no, but it’s very relevant.MK: I want to ask you....EM: But it’s very relevant. It’s very relevant to this point.MK: I understand you want to change the subject.EM: I am not changing the subject at all...
