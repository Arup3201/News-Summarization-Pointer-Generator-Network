Appeal: Lawyers for Manfo Asiedu, 40, who was jailed for 33 years in 2007 for his part in the failed 2005 London bombings, are to appeal

Lawyers for one of the 21/7 bombers will appear before the Court of Appeal saying his conviction should be quashed because evidence used in the 2007 trial was unsound.

Manfo Asiedu, 40, who was arrested after the failed London bombings in 2005, was jailed for 33 years in 2007 after admitting conspiracy to cause explosions.

He pleaded guilty after jurors in the original trial - at which four men were found guilty of conspiracy to murder - were unable to reach a verdict on the part he played.

Tomorrow, Asiedu's legal team will argue that an expert witness used in the original trial used 'flawed' evidence.

On the day of the bombing, 21 July 2005, four devices on trains and a bus around London failed to detonate, instead fizzing and popping.  The defendants at the subsequent trial argued that they never intended them to go off, and were merely intended to be fake suicide attempts as a protest against the Iraq invasion.

Forensic expert Stuart Black had testified about the mix of chemicals the would-be bombers carried in their rucksacks.  A prosecution witness, he testified that the devices were real and only failed to explode because the men had not mixed the ingredients, such as hydrogen peroxide and flour, in the right quantities.

But Asiedu's lawyers will argue that methods used by Mr Black to obtain his evidence were 'not considered to be of sufficient quality' by a senior forensic expert at the government-run Forensic Explosives Laboratory (FEL), the Guardian reports.

Sean Doyle, who went on to become chief scientist of the FEL, and his colleagues prepared a report in 2006 in which they wrote: 'Dr Black appears to have no quality system in place which would allow sufficient confidence to be placed in his findings and the validity of his results and therefore his conclusions'.

Asiedu's lawyers will claim that he would never have been convicted if the FEL's doubts about Mr Black's evidence had been put to the jury.

They will also put forward evidence that the FEL's doubts about Mr Black's evidence were put to anti-terrorist police officers, although a note about a meeting between FEL and police did note that any concerns were resolved.

Lawyers for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will argue that Mr Black's notes were made available to the defence team at the time of the trial.

In 2010 Mr Doyle gave evidence in support of an attempt by Asiedu to have his sentence overturned.

Last year, an appeal judge turned down another appeal by Asiedu to have his sentence quashed, saying that at the original trial, the defence team knew about Mr Black's original mistakes and that he had apologised and remedied them, and that his work had been peer-reviewed.

Following the 2007 trial, Muktar Ibrahim, then 29, Yassin Omar, then 26, Ramzi Mohammed, then 25, and Hussain Osman, then 28, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder and each sentenced to life imprisonment.

When jurors failed to reach a verdict on Asiedu, who was up on the same charge, he faced a retrial but then pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of conspiracy to cause explosions.
