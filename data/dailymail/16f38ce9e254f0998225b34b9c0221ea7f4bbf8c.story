Victorian police have identified one of the gunmen behind the five targeted shootings of an innocent family over the past seven months.

Shots were fired at Melbourne homes in Thomastown and Mill Park as well as a Campbellfield business linked to the same family.

On one occasion,  a stranger knocked at the door of the Thomastown home just before midnight, identified himself as John and fired a shot that narrowly missed the male resident last December.

The victim's wife and three children were asleep in the house at the time.

Detective Senior Constable Matthew McKenzie said it was unclear why the family, who have no organised crime links, were being attacked.

'We do not believe in any way that these are random attacks,' he said on Sunday.

'I will make this clear that this family is a good family, a hard-working family that have had no contact with police other than being the victims of these crimes.'

A Melbourne family has been the target of the shootings in seven months, police say

The last shooting happened in February, when a number of shots were fired at the Thomastown house.

Police have released CCTV footage of the gunman, who fled in a white Nissan Navara with black roll bars.

Detective Senior Constable McKenzie said at least one other offender was involved in the other incidents.
