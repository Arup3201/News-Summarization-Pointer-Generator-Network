Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered an investigation into official papers which suggest the Thatcher government helped India plan an attack against Sikh separatists in the Golden Temple.

The 1984 raid on Sikhism's holiest shrine at  Amritsar angered Sikhs around the world who accused the Indian army of desecration. The death toll remains disputed, with the Indian authorities putting it in the hundreds and Sikh groups in the thousands.

The assault triggered the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who ordered the attack, when two Sikh bodyguards killed her in revenge several months later.

Attack: The Golden Temple at Amritsar, India, was attacked in 1984

Newly-released British government papers suggest then-PM Margaret Thatcher responded positively to an Indian government request for advice on planning the attack and sent an officer from the elite SAS special air service to help draw up a plan.

Today, Downing Street said Mr Cameron has now ordered an investigation by top civil servant Jeremy Heywood.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'These events led to a tragic loss of life and we understand the very legitimate concerns that these papers will raise.

'The Prime Minister has asked the Cabinet Secretary to look into this case urgently and establish the facts.'

Mr Cameron and Foreign Secretary
 William Hague had been unaware of the papers prior to their 
publication, the spokesman added.

Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's foreign ministry, said his government was only aware of the story from the media.

'We will take it up with our UK counterparts and seek more information,' he said.

Hundreds died in the raid by the Indian army on the temple in June 1984, and in October that year the country's prime minister, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in an apparent act of revenge.

The papers, released under the 30-year rule and published on the Stop Deportations blog, indicate that Mrs Thatcher was aware of the involvement of an SAS officer in drawing up a plan - although it is not clear whether the Indian army operation followed this advice.

The request for British advice is disclosed in a letter, dated February 23 1984, from Brian Fall, private secretary to then foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe, to Hugh Taylor, his counterpart under home secretary Leon Brittan.

The letter said: 'The Indian authorities recently sought British advice over a plan to remove Sikh extremists from the Golden Temple in Amritsar.

'The Foreign Secretary decided to respond favourably to the Indian request and, with the Prime Minister's agreement, an SAD (sic) officer has visited India and drawn up a plan which has been approved by Mrs Gandhi. The Foreign Secretary believes that the Indian Government may put the plan into operation shortly.'

David Cameron visited the Sikh Shrine Golden temple in Amritsar on last year

Last year Mr Cameron visited the site of what he called the British Empire's most ‘monstrous’ atrocity.

The
 Prime Minister echoed the words of Winston Churchill as he paid tribute
 to the 379 innocent Indians slaughtered in the Amritsar massacre.

Mr
 Cameron concluded his visit to India with a trip to the 
Golden Temple, the holiest site for Sikhs, and the Jallianwala Bagh 
gardens – where soldiers under Brigadier Reginald Dyer fired 1,650 shots
 into a crowd of 20,000 unarmed protesters in 1919.

Mr Cameron called the killings ‘deeply shameful’ but stopped short of giving an explicit apology for the massacre.
