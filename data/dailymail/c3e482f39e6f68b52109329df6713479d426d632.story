A man posing as a member of Nick Cannon’s entourage has allegedly stolen thousands of dollars-worth of jewelry belonging to upscale L.A. clothing retailer Fred Segal.

The store has alerted LAPD to the apparent scam which began when a man calling himself Michael called the Santa Monica branch of the famous shop and claimed that the America’s Got Talent host - and husband of Mariah Carey - urgently wanted some jewelry to be worn by his wife at an upcoming event.

Michael asked the Fred Segal employee to rendezvous at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood with the agreed goods.

Upscale L.A. clothing retailer Fred Segal has a reputation as a regular hangout for celebrities and their stylists and the restaurant at the Melrose Ave branch is known as a reliable location for celebrity spotting

The woman obliged, put the jewelry in a bag and drove to the hotel, reports TMZ.

Once at the hotel, she was met in the lobby by a man who said he wasn’t Michael, but rather a security guard for Cannon and was dressed accordingly.

The supposed security guard told the Segal employee that he would take the goods up to Cannon's room and return with cash to pay for them - in order to avoid paying taxes.

The woman handed over the goods, but once out of her sight the supposed security guard disappeared and she was left to call the cops.
