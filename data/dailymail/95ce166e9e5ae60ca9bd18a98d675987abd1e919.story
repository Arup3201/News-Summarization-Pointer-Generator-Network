Superglue can solve many DIY dilemmas but one man had to resort to using it to fix his teeth thanks to being fitted with dodgy veneers.

Dean, 36, from Liverpool, needed to have veneers after he fell down the stairs at work and cracked his two front teeth.

The health worker had to have two veneers 
put on his front teeth but years later, it started to wobble. He visited a dentist who recommended further veneers, leaving his mouth full of ill-fitting, discoloured and misshapen teeth.

No more superglue: Dean can smile again after having his veneers replaced

Then the front veneer started wobbling again and would pop off at any moment. Tired of all his trips to the dentist, Dean decided to try and manage it himself by using superglue.

He said:  'My coping mechanism to stop it falling off is superglue. I just stick it on myself.
 Unfortunately that meant I have had instances when my tongue has stuck to the veneer.'

As well the danger of ingesting superglue, Dean's solution left him at risk of gum disease and low in confidence.

He said: 'It stops me from smiling and laughing if I know it has come loose. My general mood is quite low. it effects my confidence in my job and puts
 me off talking to people.

'When I look in the mirror I see the difference in the shape 
and colour of my teeth and I don't like what I see. I often feel it has come loose in my mouth and the whole thing can come off.'

Unstuck: Dean has been forced to stick his veneers in using superglue after a dentist bungled them

Before: The health worker's teeth were discoloured and wonky and one veneer kept becoming unstuck

Unstable: Dean's dodgy veneers regularly fall out - much to his acute embarrassment

Dean appeared on TV show Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if there was anything their experts could do to help him. 

Skilled cosmetic dentist Dr Marius McGovern recommended Dean overcome his fear and get back in the dentist chair in order for his smile to be fixed.

He was alarmed at the state of Dean's veneers that were causing his teeth to become decayed and left him at risk of infection and gum disease, and immediately suggested that Dean have all the original veneers removed and replaced.

After: Now he has straight, pearly whites

After the treatment, Dean was delighted with the change and couldn't stop smiling.

He said: 'I've got some much more confidence just from this change and I can actually use them as would normal teeth.'

Dean was assured his new smile would last for years as long as he looked after them.

His husband was delighted with the new look and by how happy it made Dean feel. 'There's such a difference - now I have a happy husband again.' he said.
