Ashton drove 18 hours straight from Seattle to his family's $2.5million luxury home  and said he spent 15 minutes pacing outside his parents' bedroom (Andra left, Brad right) deciding what to do before killing them

'He would cry and say, "Landon is 8 years old and he doesn’t have a dad,"' said Sarah Verbeek, a former girlfriend. 

'He'd say, "I can't believe somebody killed my parents."'

Ruth Briscoe, one of Andra's childhood friends, said that the first time she saw the young man after the tragedy; 'He collapsed on me crying. It was pretty powerful.' 

Ashton, who had no previous run-ins with the law, was arrested in March 2014 after police determined he was the 'lone suspect' in the murder.

The found a semi-automatic in his car and phone records placed him in the area around the time.

What still remains a mystery however is why he did it, especially to those who knew the young man. 

'I don't have a reason why. Just a lot of problems,' Ashton initially told authorities.

'He never showed any signs of aggression or threatened to hurt someone,' said Verbeek.

'He wasn't that kid seen on TV crime documentaries that secludes himself and doesn't talk to anyone. He never spoke bad about his family. He never talked about guns. Nothing.'

Two weeks after the shooting, Ashton and his brother Myles (right) filed for custody of their adopted siblings

In fact, many seem to think that only thing that is off-putting is how he behaved in the days after the incident.

'He talked about how he loved his parents,' said Andra's sister Lesley Summers.

''He said he'd had a dream that they weren't dead, and they drove up and Andra said, "Bullets can't kill us."' 

Conor Ward, a friend, said; 'I think of my friend I loved, and I can't see the kid who murdered his parents.'

Ashton drove 18 hours straight from Seattle to his family's $2.5million luxury home on February 9, 2013, and said he spent 15 minutes pacing outside his parents' bedroom deciding what to do before killing them.

He then shot his adopted brother and sister, just swinging open their doors and firing as they lay in bed.

Then, two weeks after the shooting, he and his brother Myles  filed for custody of those two children.

Now he is behind bars at the Central Men's Jail in Orange County, telling visitors that he wants to finish college and that be misses his family.

'I just don't get it,' said family friend Stephanie Garber.Andra's other sister.
