Anthony Trollope's novel The Duke's Children was published in 1879, but he was forced to cut 65,000 words – a quarter of the original text

He's one of the best-loved novelists of the 19th Century, whose work has been read and studied by academics and an army of fans, including Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes.

But remarkably, none of them has been getting the full story of Anthony Trollope's work – until now. A novel 'butchered' at the time of its original publication has been restored after 135 years, and is being hailed as virtually a whole new book.

When The Duke's Children was submitted for publication in 1879, Trollope was forced to hack away more than 65,000 words – a quarter of the original text. But now the sixth and final instalment in his series of novels about the Palliser family is to be published as he intended.

Last night Lord Fellowes said: 'I couldn't be more pleased. The truncated version is an ineffective conclusion to the Palliser novels but this is tremendous and does justice to the series which came before.'

The new version, which comes out next year – the bicentenary of Trollope's birth – picks up the story of former Prime Minister Plantagenet Palliser as he struggles to cope with the loss of political office, the death of his wife Lady Glencora, and the liaison of their son Lord Silverbridge with American heiress Isabel Boncassen.

The novels were adapted into a highly acclaimed 1974 BBC series, The Pallisers, which starred Philip Latham, Susan Hampshire, Anthony Andrews and Lynne Frederick. The series was repeated earlier this year.

But at the time Trollope finished the manuscript, aged 64, his reputation was at a low ebb. The literary magazine All The Year Round agreed to serialise the story only on condition of heavy cuts being made. The firm that then published it as a book used the cut version.

Michael Williamson, chairman of the Trollope Society, said it had been 'butchered', and added: 'The book has always had its fans but it has also been considered one of Trollope's weakest because of the cuts. I have been blown away by the new book.'

The restoration was done by American academic Professor Steve Amarnick, who spent ten years studying Trollope's manuscript, which is in Yale University. His team examined 1,000 pages of handwritten text to try to differentiate between the changes Trollope made himself as he worked on the book and the drastic edits which were forced upon him.

Their task was made all the harder by the fact that because Trollope wrote the novel towards the end of his life, his handwriting was almost illegible.

Prof Amarnick said: 'There were times when we'd see something and couldn't figure it out. But we'd look again a year or two later and it would suddenly click.' He added that the new version is 'far richer, more complex and ultimately more Trollopian'.

But author Joanna Trollope, who is a distant relative of Anthony, said fans of the original should not feel cheated.

She explained: 'Anyone who read the usual edition shouldn't feel they have missed out on the essentials. It is significant though. It is also peculiarly heartfelt about paternal love and, like The Way We Live Now [another of his novels], presciently modern.'

lThe Duke's Children will be published by the Folio Society in April.
