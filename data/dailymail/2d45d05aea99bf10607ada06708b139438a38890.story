Austria's Rubin Okotie may think twice about marking Sweden star Zlatan Ibrahimovic during the pair's next meeting given the frightening glare he received for simply touching the striker on Monday night.

Sweden were about to take a corner during the Euro 2016 qualifier as Okotie lined up in front of Ibrahimovic before giving him a slight nudge in the chest.

The Paris Saint-Germain striker looked disgusted by the invasion of his personal space and proceeded to stare Okotie down as the Austrian nervously nodded in his direction.

Ibrahimovic was also fortunate to escape a red card on his 100th appearance for Sweden after he floored Austria defender David Alaba.

The PSG striker caught Bayern Munich left back Alaba in the face with a flailing elbow in the first half of Monday's Euro 2016 qualifier in Vienna.

The 32-year-old failed to add to his record-breaking tally of of 50 goals in a Sweden shirt as his team battled for a 1-1 draw in the Group G clash.

A 12th-minute strike from Erkan Zengin levelled the scoring for Sweden after Alaba had given Austria the lead with an early penalty.

Speaking after the game, Sweden coach Erik Hamren said: 'I am happy with the result, I am also happy with the game ... I am sure it's going to be a really important point in qualifying.'
