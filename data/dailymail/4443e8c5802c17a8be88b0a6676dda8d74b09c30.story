The Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens clash at the M&T Bank Stadium in this AFC North divisional match-up with both teams looking to shake off questionable performances last Sunday. 

Early in the campaign it may be, but the Steelers have the opportunity to move to 2-0 both this season and in the division, which could prove vital come week 17. On the flip side, the Ravens could be 0-2 both overall and in the division with another loss on Thursday.

The Steelers looked to be control against the Cleveland Browns last Sunday. Leading 27-3 at half-time, their defensive frailties that were evident during a pre-season matchup against the fast-paced, no-huddle offense of the Eagles surfaced their ugly head once again.

Disappointment: Joe Flacco's Ravens suffered a 23-16 defeat by the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday

The Browns rallied to ensure a frantic finale at Heinz Field, but the Steelers escaped with a 30-27 win. Rookie linebacker Ryan Shazier amassed five tackles on his debut but, as a unit, the run defense of the Steelers will need to improve against the Ravens.

Ben Roethlisberger, who is entering his 11th season, threw for 365 yards, one touchdown and an interception against Cleveland, showcasing his unique ability to keep plays alive whilst under duress. 

Both running back Le'Veon Bell and wideout Antonio Brown continued where they left off last season. Bell rushed for 109 yards and a touchdown from 21 carries, along with six receptions for 88 yards. Brown, meanwhile, reeled in five catches for 116 yards and a touchdown. Second year wideout Marcus Wheaton played an integral part of the final drive that led to the game-winning field goal, reeling in six receptions for 97 yards on Sunday.

Still got it: Steve Smith scored an excellent 80-yard touchdown for Baltimore, but it was in a losing cause

The Ravens, on the other hand, looked miserable during their 23-16 defeat by the Cincinnati Bengals. The offense had a resilient defense to thank for keeping them in the contest as they only allowed the Bengals' to complete just four of 14 third down attempts. Joe Flacco was sacked a career-high 22 times last season as the Ravens stuttered to an 8-8 record. 

Former Texans head coach Gary Kubiak has been brought in as the new offensive coordinator as the team look to revitalise Flacco back into the pre-big money contract form that took them to the Super Bowl two years ago. Evidently, this is still a work in progress as Flacco attempted 62 passes, completing 35 for a total 345 yards.

 The offense wasn't helped by a number of dropped passes. Steve Smith, however, continues to defy father time, his 80-yard touchdown on Sunday was the longest of his career to date.

Gone: Baltimore released running back Ray Rice after new video footage emerged of him punching his wife

The Ravens moved swiftly on Monday to release Ray Rice from his contract following the emergence of video footage relating to his domestic violence charge during the off-season.

Fellow running back Bernard Pierce' struggles were evident, as he totaled just 14 yards from six carries. However, there may still be hope for this Ravens team looking to expose the poor run defense of the Steelers as Justin Forsett rushed for 70 yards and a touchdown off eleven carries.
