A mother of six who has had 12 operations to give her L-cup breasts says she will not stop having cosmetic surgery until they are the biggest in the world.

Lacey Wildd's children say they are embarrassed by their mother's obsession, but the 44-year-old from Miami, Florida, is already planning her next visit to the surgeon to go up to a Triple-M.

Four of her children Tori, 17, Michael, 
15, Brendon, 10, and Jenaveve, five, still live at home, and Tori has 
faced teasing at school because of her mother's appearance.

But despite her children's concerns, 
Ms Wildd, real name Paula Simonds, is determined to have the procedure -
 which will make her one of the top five biggest breasted models in the 
world.

'If I have triple M implants it will take me into the top 5 big breasted models in the world,' said Ms Wildd. 'There is a top 5 and then everybody else is below that.

'It will increase my fame and earning power considerably. I want to make the most of this opportunity, to give my kids a good lifestyle.'

Ms Wildd's
 children, including 27-year-old Ivy and 24-year-old Silas, who no 
longer live at home, say her huge breasts are embarrassing and want her 
to stop risking her health.

They are worried the MMM
 implants will cause terrible side-effects such as stretching, tearing, 
or even an infection that might kill her.

Tori said: 'I don't want my mom to have her boobs made any bigger.

'I think she isn't really thinking about our opinions. What if she dies? Is she taking that into consideration?

'Does she really care that her kids could be left alone?'

Cosmetic surgery carries the same general risks as all operations, including infection and blood clots. There's also a risk of bleeding and scarring.

Problems that can occur immediately after breast reconstruction surgery include infection, fluid under the wound and pain and discomfort.

If the area around the breast implant becomes repeatedly infected or fluid keeps building up, the implant may need to be removed.

Sometimes, the flap of tissue that is used to make a new breast can die and will need to be surgically removed.

Long-term problems that can develop after breast reconstruction surgery include the implant hardening and changing shape, fluid leaks from the implant making lymph glands swell and unequal-sized breasts due to changes in weight.

But the surgery-addicted model, who recently split from long-term boyfriend Manny, insists she will be careful.

She said she is preparing her skin for the larger
 implants to avoid the risks of rupturing, and will take every care to 
avoid dangerous staph infections.

'I've stopped wearing a bra, so my skin has time to stretch,' she said.

'I'm also trying to lose weight, and I went on a diet of liquid, vitamin B12 shots and apples for a while.'

Ms Wildd wears a corset to sculpt her 
waist, and has also had two tummy tucks, four full body 
liposuctions, abs sculpting, bottom implants and two bottom lifts.

'I know that the surgery is going to be dangerous,' she said. 'I went into this knowing that there are going to be very big risks involved. But I'm ready to take that chance.'

If she goes ahead, her new MMM implants 
will propel her into the top echelons of big breasted models, which is 
headed by 164XXX Chelsea Charms.

Cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon 
Dr Alberto Gallerani, based in Miami, warned that Ms Wildd may be suffering from body dysmorphic disorder and should not have further breast implants.

'The skin around her breasts is already extremely thin, and it would be too dangerous for her to undergo more surgery,' he said.

'I would advise she reconsider and seek help for her surgery obsession.'

But Ms Wildd believes there are surgeons willing to carry out larger breast 
implants, and is considering going abroad for an op.

She admitted she worries about the effects of her fame in her children, especially Tori and Michael, who are in high school.

'I know Tori probably gets teased at school about me. All the boys she knows want to be my friends on Facebook,' she said.

'But whenever the kids bring friends home, they see I'm really cool, like a normal mom.

'I dress normally at home, play with the kids and make nice meals for my family.

'When I'm not acting or modelling, I'm just like anyone else.'

Now she appears in films, TV shows, and advertisements, and has thousands of online fans.

The mother, who also has silicone 
lip implants, is often mobbed by fans at the beach or the mall while 
dressed up for modelling assignments.

But whenever she is out with her youngest children she says she is very protective so they have space together as a family.

Ms Wildd added: 'I was one of six children, and my mom was so poor we couldn't afford a place with electricity or running water.

'I want to provide for my kids and pay for a college education, so they have opportunities I didn't have.'

The model was a showgirl in Vegas when she was younger and says she 'loved the limelight'. After marrying in her 20s and having children, she decided to focus on her family and became a stay-at-home mother.

But she added: 'Now I need to support us, so I went back to my career as a big breasted model.'

'I'm 44 now, so I want to do this now while I still can.

'I'm more determined than ever to have this surgery, and make my dreams a reality.'
