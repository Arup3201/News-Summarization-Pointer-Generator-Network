Team news

Manchester City 

Manchester City playmaker Samir Nasri could return to action in Wednesday's Capital One Cup fourth-round tie against Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium.

The Frenchman has missed City's last seven games after undergoing groin surgery but returned to training last week.

Nasri's potential return leaves former England midfielder Frank Lampard as the only player unavailable for the holders, but manager Manuel Pellegrini could rest some key players.

Provisional squad: Hart, Cabellero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Kompany, Demichelis, Mangala, Boyata, Kolarov, Clichy, Navas, Milner, Silva, Toure, Fernando, Fernandinho, Aguero, Jovetic, Dzeko, Pozo. 

Manchester City beat Newcastle 2-0 in August and the two sides face each other in the Capital One Cup

Newcastle

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is likely to be without striker Papiss Cisse once again for the Capital One Cup fourth-round trip to Manchester City.

He missed out on the 2-1 win over Tottenham with a knee injury and his return date is not yet clear.

Ayoze Perez should continue in his place, while Sammy Ameobi and Remy Cabella made compelling cases from the bench against Spurs, and Ryan Taylor could make his first appearance after enduring more than two years of injury woe.

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Dummett, Haidara, R Taylor, Coloccini, Williamson, S Taylor, Tiote, Anita, Sissoko, Colback, Cabella, Gouffran, Obertan, Ameobi, Riviere, Perez, Armstrong.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Manchester City have won their last 11 against Newcastle United in all competitions and are unbeaten in 17 (W15 D2).

Indeed City’s run of 11 consecutive wins in all competitions over Newcastle is the best run against a single side in their history.

Alan Pardew’s side have won their last three League Cup away games, as well as seven of their last nine.

Since the start of 2012/13, Edin Dzeko has scored eight goals and assisted two more in seven League Cup games.

Newcastle have failed to score in their last five against the Citizens and have conceded at least twice in each of their last 14.

James Milner has assisted five goals in his last five League Cup games.
