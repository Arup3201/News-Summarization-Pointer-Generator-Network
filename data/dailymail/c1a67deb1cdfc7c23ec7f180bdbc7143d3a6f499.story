Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of football including Aaron Ramsey's return and John Stones being a rock at the back for Everton.

1. John Stones reminded Everton how badly they had missed him during their awful exit from the Europa League in midweek.

The 20-year-old, left out by Roberto Martinez in Dynamo Kiev who picked Antolin Alcarez instead, returned to the starting line-up with a strong defensive display at QPR.

Stones and Phil Jagielka made 41 clearances between them to limit Rangers to just one shot on target. Everton have lost just three of the 12 games the pair have played as centre backs since Stones recovered from injury.

2. England boss Roy Hodgson seems to rate Andros Townsend far higher than Mauricio Pochettino does.

The winger got dragged off by his Spurs boss after just 58 minutes of the 4-3 win over Leicester – meaning he’s been hooked early in all the last eight matches he has started for his club.

Of 32 appearances in a Tottenham shirt this season he’s only completed 90 minutes on seven occasions.

Despite that Hodgson picked him in November – although he was forced to withdraw through injury – and has him in the squad for this week’s fixtures against Lithuania and Italy.

3. If Burnley do finish the season being relegated back to the Championship it won’t be through lack of effort.

The EA Sports performance data shows they collectively ran two miles more than Southampton’s side as they fought to avoid the 2-0 defeat at St Mary’s – 73.8 miles compared to Saints’ 71.8.

It’s nothing new – Sean Dyche’s side have outworked their opponents in every single one of their 30 Premier League fixtures so far.

4. Swansea’s ability to find bargain signings continues to be the envy of many other clubs – and the £3million they paid Southampton for Jack Cork looks the latest astute investment.

The 25-year-old son of former Wimbledon star Alan has slotted straight into Garry Monk’s midfield with seven 90 minute appearances in a row and was excellent at Aston Villa.

He covered more ground (7.1miles), played more passes (72), fought in more duels (21) and won more tackles (5) than any other player on the pitch.

5. Dick Advocaat needs to help Connor Wickham rediscover the form that rescued the club a year ago as a priority for this season’s fight against relegation.

The new Black Cats boss picked the 21-year-old at West Ham for his first 90 minute appearance since January 1st.

Wickham, who scored five goals in the final six games last term, had just one shot on target and one wayward at Upton Park – and has scored only three League games all season.

6. Aaron Ramsey’s return to fitness has come at the perfect time for Arsenal as they try to chase down Manchester City for the runners-up spot.

The Welsh international midfielder took full advantage of the space given him by Newcastle as the Gunners went into a two goal lead.

Ramsey, whose late appearance off the bench almost helped rescue Arsenal’s Champions League fortunes in Monaco, played more accurate passes in the attacking half of the field than any of his team mates.

7. Manchester United look a more effective side when they pass the ball rather than lump it up to Marouane Fellaini.

Louis van Gaal’s side played 568 passes in the 2-1 win at Anfield, some 162 more than Liverpool.

It was also only 27 less than their best away total of the season so far, when they ran rings round relegation candidates QPR at Loftus Road in January.

8. Paul Trollope has set about restoring his reputation as one of the game’s bright young coaches since Cardiff appointed him as number two to Russell Slade.

The 42-year-old, whose CV included taking Bristol Rovers into League One as a manager then helping Chris Hughton keep Norwich in the Premier League, had spent nearly a year out of the game before getting the chance in South Wales.

Cardiff had just one win in 11 games before he arrived – but the 2-0 success against Birmingham makes it four wins and 15 points in all from nine games since then.

9. Juventus and former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is being talked about in fees of up to £100million – but Crawley boss Dean Saunders picked up his brother Mathias from the Turin giants on a free transfer.

The 6ft 3ins striker has proved an inspired signing, even if he is yet to get his first goal.

His physical presence has helped make space for Izale McLeod to get seven in ten games since Pogba, 24, made his debut at the start of February, with Crawley collecting 16 points in the process.

10. Shaun Derry has suffered a major setback to what looked like a promising career as a manager at Notts County after he was sacked on Monday.

The former QPR ace lifted the club to third in the League One table in October – but since then has overseen a slump that has seen them crash to just one place off the relegation zone following a 4-1 thrashing at MK Dons.

Derry was unable to keep a settled side – County  have used 46 players in League games this season.
