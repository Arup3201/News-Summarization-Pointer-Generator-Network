Leave the luxury five-star resorts to mere mortals. To holiday like the truly rich and famous, it simply has to be a private island.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made headlines earlier this week for shelling out more than $100 million (£62 million) for 700 acres on Kauai's North Shore and that whopping price didn't even buy him the entire island.

But there are a number of wealthy names who have purchased their own private paradise - and most for well below what Zuckerberg paid.

The Exumas archipelago in the Bahamas is the backyard of the wealthy, with Johnny Depp, Faith Hill, David Copperfield and Eddie Murphy among those who own property there.

Richard Branson is one of the most well-known private island purchasers, with Ricky Martin, Celine Dion and Leonardo DiCaprio also in the exclusive club. 

Johnny Depp - Little Halls Pond Cay, Bahamas 

Depp first laid eyes on Little Halls Pond Cay while shooting Pirates of the Caribbean in 2004 and snapped it up for $3.6 million.

The island has six beaches (named after Depp's children and former partner Vanessa Paradis), a palm tree-lined lagoon and solar-powered houses.

'I don’t think I’d ever seen any place so pure and beautiful,' he told Vanity Fair in 2009. 'You can feel your pulse rate drop about 20 beats. It’s instant freedom.'

Leonardo DiCaprio: Blackadore Cay, Belize

The Wolf of Wall Street star paid $1.75 million for this island off the coast of Belize back in 2005. It is located close to the barrier reef and famous Great Blue Hole, a popular diving spot. 

DiCaprio is said to have plans to develop the island into an eco-resort.

David Copperfield - Musha Cay, Bahamas 

Magician David Copperfield owns Musha Cay, a 700-acre island in the Bahamas which he purchased for $50 million in 2006.

He doesn't keep it all for himself though; the island can be rented for $39,000 per night (four-night minimum), and is a popular getaway for Copperfield's celebrity friends. Past visitors include Oprah and John Travolta.

Copperfield spent a reported $30 million renovating the property, which boasts five villas and an open-air movie theatre on the beach.

Larry Ellison - Lana'i, Hawaii

The billionaire co-founder of Oracle shelled out $600 million for the Hawaiian island of Lana'i in 2012. But even that jaw-dropping price didn't buy Ellison the whole thing - he got 98 per cent of the island.

As owner of much of the island, Ellison obtained two Four Seasons resorts, two championship golf courses, 50 miles of beach, 88,000 acres of pineapple fields and a solar farm.

Richard Branson is another celebrity who likes to see a return on his investment. He famously owns Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands, which he purchased back in 1978 for $180,000 - well under the $6 million asking price. 

He rents the island out for a staggering $62,000 a day. Past guests include Princess Diana, Mariah Carey, Robert De Niro and Steven Spielberg.

Branson also owns Makepeace Island  in Queensland, Australia. The heart-shaped island, on the Noosa River, rents for $9,586 for up to 22 guests.
