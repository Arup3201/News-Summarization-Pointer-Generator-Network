Stinky fish fertilizer and two dozen law-enforcement officers kept pot smokers away from a grassy quad at the University of Colorado on Friday, but a few hundred protesters defied the crackdown and rallied on another field, where some lit up at 4.20pm.

It was a far cry from last year's April 20 pot celebration, when more than 10,000 people gathered on the university's Norlin Quadrangle for the annual ritual of enjoying a smoke and demonstrating for legalizing marijuana.

That made the university the scene of one of the largest campus celebrations of cannabis in the nation - a reputation that prompted university administrators to take extraordinary steps to stamp out this year's rally.

They banned unauthorized visitors from campus, and spread smelly fertilizer on the Norlin Quad and declared it off-limits. They even booked Haitian-born hip-hop star Wyclef Jean for a free concert timed to coincide with the traditional 4.20pm pot gathering.

Still, they were only partially 
successful. A few dozen protesters veered off a sidewalk bordering the 
university on Friday afternoon and marched through campus, holding signs
and chanting, 'Roll it. Smoke it. Legalize it.'

Others joined in as the marchers made
their way through the campus, and after they halted on a grassy field 
near a science building, the crowd reached 300, with 400 more watching 
from the perimeter, campus police estimated.

They counted down the seconds to 
4.20pm, let out a cheer at zero and then lit up, exhaling a collective 
cloud of smoke that rose over their heads.

A few police were on hand, some in 
SWAT gear, but they made no move to interfere. After about 15 minutes 
the crowd and the smoke dispersed.

Jonathan Grell, a sophomore majoring 
in international affairs, said he joined the rally because it 'mocks 
America's arcane drug laws.'

He said he didn't smoke Friday but has benefited from medical marijuana.

'I participated to be counted and to make my voice heard,' he said.

James Moore, a graduate student in 
physics, said he went to the rally to protest the administration's 
decision to close down part of the campus.

'You can't do that,' Moore said.

The campus is public property and 
students pay to attend, he said, and the university has no right to say,
'No, you can't walk on the grass.'

Administrators had argued they have 
the right to protect faculty, staff and students from disruption, and a 
judge said Thursday that the university could close its grounds to 
unauthorized visitors Friday.

University spokesman Bronson Hilliard
said the steps the campus took were a success, measured by students 
being able to go to class and faculty being able to teach.

'For us the real achievement was 
there were not 10,000 to 12,000 people in the academic heart of our 
campus disrupting our fundamental operations,' he said.

Marijuana smokefests at 4.20pm on 
April 20, or 4/20, have become a counterculture ritual, with celebrants 
gathering from San Francisco's Golden Gate Park to New York's Greenwich 
Village.

In Austin, Texas, country music 
legend Willie Nelson helped unveil a downtown statue honoring him by 
singing his new song 'Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.'

Organizers said they didn't set the 
unveiling for April 20 because it was the date of the marijuana ritual, 
but once they realized it, they scheduled the unveiling at 4.20pm in 
light of Nelson's openness about his marijuana use and advocacy for 
legalization.

Thousands of people gathered in Denver near the state Capitol for the start of a two-day marijuana rally.

Officers ticketed people they saw 
smoking marijuana if they did not have a state-issued card allowing them
to consume marijuana for medical purposes, which is legal under state 
law.

Less than a handful of tickets were issued by mid-afternoon, Detective Raquel Lopez said.

A fair-like atmosphere prevailed at 
the Denver rally, with vendors selling munchies from food carts and one 
person peddling glass pipes from a suitcase.

The number 420 has been associated 
with marijuana use for decades, though the reasons are murky. Its use as
code for marijuana spread among California pot users in the 1960s and 
spread nationwide among followers of the Grateful Dead.

Theories abound on its origin. Some 
say it was once police code in Southern California to denote marijuana 
use, probably an urban legend. It was a title number for a 2003 
California bill about medical marijuana, an irony fully intended.

Others trace it to a group of 
California teenagers who would meet at 4.20pm to search for weed, a 
theory as elusive as the outdoor cannabis crop they were seeking. The 
code stuck because authorities and nosy parents didn't know what it 
meant, at least for a while.

In Colorado, recent 4/20 observations
blossomed alongside the state's medical marijuana industry. Approved by
Colorado voters in 2000, medical marijuana boomed after federal 
authorities signaled in 2009 they would pursue higher-level drug crimes.

All marijuana is illegal under 
federal law, though Colorado voters this November will consider whether 
to legalize it for recreational use for adults over 21.

At the University of Colorado, three 
students were arrested for trespassing when they walked onto the Norlin 
Quad, sat down and refused to leave, campus police said.

Eleven others, including two 
students, were ticketed for trespassing, and one was ticketed for 
marijuana possession on campus, police said.

One of the three arrested told reporters the crackdown was more disruptive than any of the previous years' rallies.

Campus police spokesman Ryan Huff 
estimated the university would spend about $110,000 on law-enforcement 
Friday, about double the amount spent last year.

The yellow tape was removed from the quad and officers began withdrawing shortly after 4:20 p.m.
Playboy magazine named Colorado the nation's top party school in 2011.

The campus also repeatedly ranks 
among the top schools for marijuana use, according to a 'Reefer Madness'
list conducted by The Princeton Review.

The University of Colorado's student 
government supported the university's anti-4/20 actions. And other 
Colorado students created a Facebook campaign urging their colleagues to
wear formal clothing to school on Friday to repudiate the party-school 
reputation.

Loud and proud: Country music legend Willie Nelson is open about his pot usage

WHO CELEBRATES? The observation is shared by marijuana users from San Francisco's Golden Gate Park to New York's Greenwich Village. Last year, some 10,000 people gathered at the University of Colorado-Boulder to simultaneously smoke marijuana. This year, the university is shutting down a campus quad that hosts the annual 4/20 gathering.Â 

Organizers say the protest may be moved to a nearby off-campus neighbourhood, which could cause clashes between police and protesters. A rally is planned for Denver near the state capitol on Friday and Saturday. Police have suggested they'll be taking a hands-off approach to the gathering, which could draw tens of thousands of people. In Austin, Texas, country music legend Willie Nelson, who's open about his marijuana use, was expected to help unveil an 8-foot statue of himself in downtown Austin at 4:20 p.m. local time.

WHAT'S IT MEAN? The number 420 has been associated with marijuana use for decades, though its origins are murky. Its use as code for marijuana spread among California pot users in the 1960s and spread nationwide among followers of the Grateful Dead. Like most counterculture slang, theories abound on its origin. Some say it was once police code in Southern California to denote marijuana use (probably an urban legend).

It was a title number for a 2003 California bill about medical marijuana, an irony fully intended. Others trace it to a group of California teenagers who would meet at 4:20 p.m. to search for weed (a theory as elusive as the outdoor cannabis crop they were seeking). Yet the code stuck for obvious reasons: Authorities and nosy parents didn't know what it meant.

HOW MANY STATES HAVE LEGALIZED MEDICAL MARIJUANA? In 1996, a ballot measure made California the first state to legalize medical marijuana. Sixteen states now allow the use of medicinal marijuana. In major cities like New York and Philadelphia, having small amounts of marijuana on your person has been decriminalised.

HOW MANY STATES ARE CONSIDERING LEGALIZING RECREATIONAL POT? Two states - Colorado and Washington - are considering legalizing pot for recreational purposes.

WHERE DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STAND? Marijuana use, sale and possession are illegal under federal law.
