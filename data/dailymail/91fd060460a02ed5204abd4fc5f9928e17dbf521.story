Naoya Tomita, 25, the 200 metre breaststroke gold medallist from the 2010 Games, could face criminal charges over the theft of the camera, owned by a South Korean media organisation, team bosses said.

Surveillance cameras at the Games in Incheon, South Korea, captured Tomita putting the camera in his bag on Thursday after watching his team-mates compete. Officials said he admitted taking the camera.

'I can't recall anything like this ever happening before with a Japanese athlete at the Asian Games,' said Tsuyoshi Aoki, the head of Japan's delegation. 'It is a violation of the most basic code of conduct.

Tomita could face criminal charges for the theft of the camera, which belonged to a Korean media organisation

Mr Aoki said Tomita would have to pay his own airfare home.
