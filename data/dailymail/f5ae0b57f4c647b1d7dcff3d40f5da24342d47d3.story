Philip Hammond announced the medal in the Commons today

The Falklands are to be awarded a special medal in recognition of the 'indomitable will and personal commitment' of the islanders  during the Argentine occupation.

The South Atlantic Medal has been awarded to almost 30,000 troops and civilians who served during the operation to liberate the Islands in 1982.

Among its holders is the Duke of York, who flew helicopters for the Royal Navy during the war.

Eligibility for the medal was recently extended, following a review, to cover individuals involved in the clean-up period after the Argentine surrender.

But the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has now announced, in a statement to the House of Commons, that the medal is to be awarded to the whole archipelago next year.

'I am pleased to inform the House that in 2015 the South Atlantic Medal will be presented, on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen, to the Falkland Islands, in recognition of the assistance provided to the Forces of the United Kingdom during the liberation of the Islands in 1982,' Mr Hammond said.

'The islanders' individual acts of courage exemplified the indomitable will and personal commitment to defending the islands' right of self determination.'

The award of a medal to islands is not unique.

Malta was granted the George Cross in recognition of its inhabitants' bravery during the Second World War.

David Cameron, in his Christmas message to the Islanders, said next year would also see the unveiling of a bronze statue of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in the Falklands.

He said 2015 would be a year when 'the British government, again, steadfastly defends the freedom she helped you secure'.

The Prime Minister said: 'One hundred years ago, the Allies defended their base in Stanley from German aggression and this month we honour the sacrifice that so many made.

'And three decades ago, UK forces stood with the islanders as they faced a direct and grave threat to their sovereignty and it is absolutely right that we will be recognising this next year, when your islands will collectively receive the South Atlantic Medal and that you'll be unveiling a bronze statue to honour someone who played such an important role in that liberation - Baroness Thatcher.'

Roger Edwards, chair of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands, said: 'It is an honour for the Falkland Islands to be awarded the South Atlantic Medal.

'We will never forget the sacrifices made by all to protect our home.

'The Falklands have come a long way since the dark days of 1982 when many in the Islands faced extreme difficulty with steely resolve.

'It is a testament to the resourcefulness, integrity and determination of our proud community that the islands are now one of the United Kingdom's most dynamic and successful overseas territories with opportunities for all.'
