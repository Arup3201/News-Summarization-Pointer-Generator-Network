This isn't easy. Normally picking a united Merseyside team is tough because so many players have compelling claims for inclusion. Ahead of the 223rd derby, though, that certainly isn't the case.

With Brendan Rodgers admitting Liverpool's play has been 'a little bit broken' and Roberto Martinez accepting Everton's defending has been 'poor' both managers have issues to address ahead of the crucial game.

It also means Sportsmail has a job trying to come up with the best combined 11 from the players who are expected to be available on Saturday – you will not see those in the treatment room figuring below – but it won't stop us. So here we go. Our formation is 4-2-3-1...

Everton shot-stopper Tim Howard makes a flying save during their Europa League clash against Wolfsburg

Goalkeeper - Tim Howard

This has not been the American's finest week, with errors against Crystal Palace and Swansea, but eight days ago he was outstanding in the Europa League win over Wolfsburg and is generally in better form than Simon Mignolet, who has looked short of confidence too often of late.

Republic of Ireland international Seamus Coleman has proved one of the signings of recent years for Everton, offering an oustanding threat going forward and helping his side out defensively whenever he is needed

Right-back - Seamus Coleman

Martinez said he will give the Republic of Ireland international every chance to prove he is able to play and his faith is unlikely to be misplaced. Coleman offers a persistent outlet down the flank and defends as though his life depends on it. He gives more going forward than Liverpool's Javier Manquillo. Glen Johnson's injury means he can't be considered.

John Stones, left, has been thrown in at the deep end for club and country but has not looked fazed for either

Central defenders - John Stones and Martin Skrtel 

An unexpected pairing, perhaps, but valid reasons for their selection. Stones has caught the eye playing for England and would not be flustered by the big game atmosphere. Skrtel, meanwhile, remains Liverpool's best central defender and his importance to the team has been shown in his absence. He also provides a goal threat at set pieces. Others who play in this position at Anfield and Goodison simply haven't been good enough so far.

Slovakia captain Martin Skrtel is Liverpool's best option at centre-back and also chips in with a few goals

Left-back - Leighton Baines

Alberto Moreno would undoubtedly have his backers but you know what you are getting with Baines; reliability at the back and going forward, terrific dead ball delivery and experience. Moreno is still adjusting to English football and doesn't defend as well as Baines yet.

Leighton Baines, left, is the obvious choice at left-back in our Merseyside XI after excelling for Roberto Martinez's side since joining the club from Wigan for a fee of £5million in the summer of 2007

Holding midfield - James McCarthy and Steven Gerrard 

McCarthy is a player that every team needs, a 7 out of 10 performance, almost every week and he has been one of Everton's top performers so far. The questions, here, will come over Gerrard, whom Rodgers staunchly defended on Monday. Some will ask why he gets in, so here are the reasons: if, say, you want a last minute penalty converting or a pass delivering at the right moment, Gerrard remains the man to do it.

Despite coming under fire recently Steven Gerrard remains the man Liverpool will turn to in a time of need

Right midfield - Jordan Henderson

One of the first names on this teamsheet. Growing in stature with each week, a crucial cog in the engine room and the England international's progress is showing no signs of stopping. He is versatile, too, and can operate in other roles if required.

The versatile Jordan Henderson, centre, has established himself as a key part of Brendan Rodgers's midfield

Attacking midfield - Steven Naismith

The most improved player at Goodison Park in the last 12 months, Everton are better when he is in the team. Works relentlessly, uses the ball intelligently and has the knack of popping up in the right areas at the right moment to score goals. Everton may have started the campaign slowly but that is not something you could level at him.

Scotland attacker Steven Naismith has started the season superbly with three goals in the Premier League

Left midfield - Kevin Mirallas

When this Belgium international gets in the mood, he is exciting to watch, his speed and skill can befuddle defenders. In his first Merseyside derby, he terrorised Liverpool for 45 minutes until he was the victim of reckless tackle from Luis Suarez. Good from set pieces and scores goals, doesn't appear to showing any lingering fatigue from his World Cup exertions.

Kevin Mirallas has been a thorn in Liverpool's side when he has played in Merseyside derbies in recent years

Centre-forward - Raheem Sterling

The most unusual pick? You may have anticipated Sterling getting into this team but not as a centre forward. Needs must, however, and this why he would fulfil the role. For starters, Daniel Sturridge may not be fit after his thigh problem. Secondly, Mario Balotelli has not been good enough, ditto Fabio Borini. Then, with Everton, Romelu Lukaku has not yet done enough, while Samuel Eto'o has had fitness problems.

That is why Sterling, with his explosive pace, dazzling skill and three goals to his name already, has to lead this line. It might be an unorthodox position but it is one in which he has the tools to thrive.
