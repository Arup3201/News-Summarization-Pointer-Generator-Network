Paramedics and first aiders were required to help a student as hundreds of teenagers hit the streets of Nottingham for the latest Carnage pub crawl.

One student was seen receiving attention from a paramedic and first aiders as others looked on during the annual event last night.

Hordes of undergraduates filled the city centre for the event with girls hitting the town dressed as Playboy bunnies.

The Playboys vs Bunnies themed event attracted hundreds of revellers with its offers of alcoholic drinks for £1

Despite plummeting temperatures and 
driving rain, female students could also be seen wearing micro skirts, 
hot pants and skimpy tops.

Young men and women also wore the official Carnage t-shirts - which gives them entry to bars and discounted drinks for just £1.

At
 one point a man wearing a backwards baseball cap with black blazer and 
jeans was seen struggling to escape the clutches of a nightclub bouncer.

Other female revellers were seen getting piggyback rides from male friends.

One male student chose to wear black knee-high socks and a silver thong with his ripped Carnage t-shirt.

The man, who also wore a black bow tie, was pictured with a girl dressed as
 a scantily clad bunny and another two female students in short skirts.

The
 Carnage UK events are run by Varsity Leisure Group, a 
multi-million-pound business that puts on hundreds of pub crawls 
throughout Britain.

Organisers have been criticised in the past for encouraging binge drinking and anti-social behaviour.

But founder Paul Bahia, a Birmingham 
University graduate, has previously denied this, insisting the events 
are 'heavily focused on group identity, social and ethical cohesion and 
fancy dress themes'.

This 
year's theme is 'Playboys vs Bunnies' - following on from 'Nympho Nurses
 And Dirty Doctors' and 'Pimps And Hoes' in previous years.

Students
 are drawn to the events by cheap £1 alcohol deals and a slogan on the 
Carnage Facebook page promises they will have the 'best night of their 
lives'.
