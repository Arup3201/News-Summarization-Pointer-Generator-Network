President Barack Obama secretly met with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the White House today, a White House official has confirmed.

The lunch was not on the president's schedule and only became public knowledge after People magazine tweeted a photo of its Washington Bureau Chief, Sandra Westfall, standing next to Clinton with the caption: 'PEOPLE's @sswestfall chats w/@HillaryClinton before her mtg at the WH. Hope we didn't make her late for @BarackObama!

People Magazine raised questions about how the president spent his day on Thursday after tweeting out this photo of it Washington Bureau Chief Sandra Westfall, left, and Hillary Clinton, right

People quickly deleted the tweet but not before reporters made copies of it.

A White House official confirmed to the reporter assigned to cover the president today on behalf of the White House press pool that Obama did in fact have Clinton over to the West Wing today, but it was for a casual lunch, not a meeting, the official said.

'The President enjoyed an informal, private lunch with Secretary Clinton at the White House this afternoon,' the official reportedly told Roll Call reporter Steven Dennis.

Obama's 'informal' luncheon with Clinton comes in the middle of a high-profile scandal involving the Veteran's Affairs Department.

Yesterday, the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General released an interim report stating that 1,700 veterans at a VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, were systematically placed on secret waiting lists where they languished while waiting to see VA doctors.

More than 40 veterans on the secret waiting lists died, according to a former doctor at the hospital.

After looking into the retired physician's claims, the Office of Inspector General found that staff at the hospital claimed veterans were seeing doctors in a timely manner, when in reality many waited an average of 115 days for their first appointment.

As a result of the preliminary report, VA hospitals across the country are now under scrutiny.

President Obama has not publicly addressed the findings of the report, yet he had time to meet with Clinton today.

The White House
official who confirmed the lunch did not say what the president and Clinton, a presumed 2016 
presidential candidate, discussed or how long they ate.

It's possible the two nemeses talked about how the president should handle the VA scandal. A plethora of lawmakers have called on the president to either fire VA Secretary Eric Shinseki or for Shinseki to resign on his own accord.

The former secretary of state and the president may also have discussed the president's decision to draw down forces in Afghanistan.

President Obama nnounced yesterday that the U.S. would withdraw the bulk of its forces in Afghanistan by the end of of this year, leaving only 9,800 soldiers in the country, down from 32,000.

The midterm elections were likely a topic of discussion, as well.

Republicans have a strong chance of reclaiming the Senate from the president's political party and making Obama a Lame Duck president during his final years in office.

The GOP is likely to stay in command of the House of Representatives. Thus, winning the Senate is the president's last best hope to move forward his agenda during his second term.

A Washington Post/ABC News poll released earlier this month found that Hillary Clinton had a significantly higher favorability rating than President Obama.

Respondents to the poll gave Clinton a 53 percent approval rating. Only 41 percent said the same of Obama.

Obama has been trekking the country trying to raise money for Democratic candidates in competitive races, but based on polling data, Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, would be move valuable advocates on the campaign trail than the sitting president.

Today's incident is likely to bring back memories of the 2008 presidential race, when Clinton's campaign released an ad claiming then-Senator Hillary Clinton was betterr equipped than Obama to protect the nation in a crisis.

In the infamous '3 am call' ad, Clinton's campaign asked who voters wanted answering the phone in the middle of the night when trouble came knocking at America's door.

The ad never referenced Obama or Clinton, other than Clinton's required seal of approval at the end of the ad, but it was obvious who the ad was targeting.
