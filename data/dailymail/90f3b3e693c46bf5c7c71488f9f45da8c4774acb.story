The New Republic's owner Chris Hughes has penned an op-ed, offering his side in the wake of tens of staff members quitting their jobs at the 100-year-old magazine.

The resignations took place following Hughes' reportedly looking for someone to take Franklin Foer's spot as the editor of The New Republic, according to the The New York Times.

Both Foer and literary editor Leon Wieseltier resigned, according to the newspaper. Contributing editor Ryan Lizza, who resigned, told The Times  over 50 editors and contributing editors trailed the two men.

''At the heart of the conflict of the past few days is a divergent view on how the New Republic — and journalism more broadly — will survive,' Hughes wrote in an op-ed for  The Washington Post. 'In one view, it is a "public trust" and not a business. It is something greater than a commercial enterprise, ineffable, an ideal that cannot be touched. Financially, it would be a charity [...] At the New Republic, I believe we owe it to ourselves and to this institution to aim to become a sustainable business and not position ourselves to rely on the largesse of an unpredictable few. Our success is not guaranteed, but I think it’s critical to try.'  

December 22 Snyder is set to start as editor of the magazine, which will cuts its production in half down to 10 issues a year, The New York Times reported.

CEO Guy Vidra, formerly of Yahoo!, also announced hopes that The New Republic could turn into a 'vertically integrated digital media company,' according to the newspaper.

Hughes, a Facebook founder, also wrote that the magazine will have both physical and online forms.

'Former editors and writers who claim in an open letter that the New Republic should not be a business would prefer an institution that looks backward more often than forward and does not challenge itself to experiment with new business models and new ways to tell important stories,' he said in the op-ed. 'Unless we experiment now, today’s young people will not even recognize the New Republic’s name nor care about its voice when they arrive in the halls of power tomorrow.'

At the end of the piece, Hughes attacked those that left The New Republic, writing 'If you really care about an institution and want to make it strong for the ages, you don’t walk out. You roll up your sleeves, you redouble your commitment to those ideals in a changing world, and you fight. This 100-year-old story is worth fighting for.'

Hughes' piece referred to an earlier letter signed by twenty editors and contributing editors that was published Friday by The Huffington Post.

The letter said 'The New Republic cannot be merely a "brand." It has never been and cannot be a "media company" that markets "content." Its essays, criticism, reportage, and poetry are not "product." It is not, or not primarily, a business. It is a voice, even a cause. It has lasted through numerous transformations of the "media landscape"—transformations that, far from rendering its work obsolete, have made that work ever more valuable.

'The New Republic is a kind of public trust. That is something all its previous owners and publishers understood and respected. The legacy has now been trashed, the trust violated.'
