David Silva has relieved the worries of Chelsea supporters by playing down Diego Costa's hamstring injury.

The Spain hitman picked up the problem while on international duty and left the Spanish squad ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier against Macedonia to recover.

Costa has four goals in his first three Premier League games, making a lightning start to his career at Stamford Bridge, but it was feared he could miss the trip to Everton last weekend with an injury and this new blow is a problem he suffered last season with Atletico Madrid.

However, Spain team-mate and Manchester City playmaker David Silva does not believe the injury is particularly bad - raising hopes that Costa could be fit to face Swansea at Stamford Bridge next weekend, as well as Silva's Manchester City a week later. 

'I saw Costa was doing well and I talked to him. The injury is nothing serious,' Silva said.

Spain flopped at the World Cup with Costa leading the line and struggled to create chances in their 1-0 friendly defeat to France, again with Costa up front. But Silva says slowly but surely La Roja are getting used to his style of play.

'We are trying to connect with Costa. We’re on it,' Silva said.

Main man: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will be hoping Costa is available for his side's next game

'Over the last few years we’ve been known for having the ball and creating chances. We have to be patient as there are new people here.

'Now we don’t really create much. We’re working to improve that aspect.'

Costa flew back to London on Friday for tests on his injury although the extent of the problem is yet to be fully established.
