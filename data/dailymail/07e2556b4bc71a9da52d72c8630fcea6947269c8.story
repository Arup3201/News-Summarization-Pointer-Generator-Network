Killed by the State? Dr David Kelly, who was found dead a decade ago today after leaking that the Blair government had 'sexed up' the Iraq dossier

Doctors campaigning for an investigation into the death of Iraq weapons expert Dr David Kelly believe he was the victim of a Hillsborough-style cover-up.

The group says it would be ‘shameful’ if the truth about the death was suppressed in a similar way to that of the 1989 football stadium tragedy in which 96 Liverpool fans died.

The doctors claim to have ‘multiple serious concerns’ over evidence used in the case and fear there were ‘serious deficiencies’ in the investigation by police.

The group is calling for a full inquest into Dr Kelly’s death in woods near to his Oxfordshire home and a review of the investigation by Thames Valley Police.

The chemical and biological weapons expert was found dead a decade ago today, shortly after being exposed as the source of a BBC claim that Tony Blair’s Government had ‘sexed up’ the case for war in Iraq.

The Hutton Report later found that Dr Kelly, a member of a UN inspection team sent to Iraq to unearth weapons of mass destruction, had committed suicide.

However, many still believe the 59-year-old scientist may have been murdered by the security services.

The group of doctors, which is led by the radiologist Stephen Frost and includes Andrew Watt, David Halpin and Christopher Burns-Cox, says Dr Kelly’s death is ‘a matter of continuing public and professional concern’.

Their statement said: ‘In the interests of justice, both an inquest into Dr Kelly’s death and an Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into what we consider to be a deficient and dishonest investigation by Thames Valley Police are required.

‘The British public had to wait 23 years for the truth about the Hillsborough disaster to emerge.

‘It would be shameful if the truth about the suspicious death of Dr David Kelly were concealed for a similar length of time.’

A silent vigil is due to be held today in support of the campaign outside London’s High Court, where the Hutton inquiry was held.

Alastair Hay, a close friend of Dr Kelly’s, has called on conspiracy theorists to accept that the scientist took his own life.
