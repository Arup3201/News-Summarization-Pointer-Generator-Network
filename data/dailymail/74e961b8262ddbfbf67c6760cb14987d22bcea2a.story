Liverpool striker Divock Origi and Everton forward Romelu Lukaku came off the bench to score in the second half in Brussels.

Nicolas Lombaerts put the home side ahead in the 12th minute when he headed home Adnan Januzaj's free kick but the defender was at fault a minute later when he left Alfred Finnbogason to force the ball home at the far post.

Origi, on a season-long loan to French side Lille, let fly with a 25-yard drive to put Belgium 2-1 up in the 62nd minute and Lukaku sealed victory in the friendly match with a tap in.

The result ended the visitors' five-match unbeaten run.

Belgium had the lion's share of possession but Iceland repeatedly showed themselves to be dangerous on the counter and could have gone into half-time ahead were it not for a couple of decent saves from Belgium's Thibaut Courtois.

Belgium's 12th minute opener came directly from the training ground as Lombaerts charged forward and deftly headed Januzaj's free kick into the net.

But the hosts, missing injured captain and central defender Vincent Kompany, held on for little more than a minute before Iceland's Finnbogason found himself unmarked at the back post from a corner for an easy tap-in

Substitute Origi re-established Belgium's lead in the 62nd minute, feigning right, then cutting inside to blast home with his left beyond Iceland's Ingvar Jonsson.

Shortly afterwards, Club Bruges' Thomas Meunier opened up Iceland's defence, before passing to Dries Mertens who fed Lukaku in front of an open net to settle the encounter.

Iceland had won their three opening Euro 2016 qualifiers, including a 2-0 victory over the Netherlands a month ago, to top group A on goal difference from the Czech Republic, who they visit on Sunday.

Belgium will on the same day host Group B leaders Wales, the last side to beat Iceland, in a friendly in March.

Belgium will be heartened by the fine form of Courtois and the return of Christian Benteke, playing his first match since March.

The striker, currently serving a three-match Premier League ban, delivered what Belgium have lacked in his absence, a man to hold the ball up front.
