Mary Portas said charity shops need a makeover to become 'less smelly' if they are to help revive high streets

Charity shops need a makeover to become ‘less smelly’ if they are to help revive high streets, retail guru Mary Portas claimed yesterday.

Second hand stores that increasingly dominate struggling town centres should transform themselves into ‘beautiful, respectful’ places rather than being the ‘sad face’ in a parade of shops, she said.

Ms Portas, who led a government backed review of high streets, spoke out amid fears that the explosion of charity shops since the credit crunch is turning Britain into a nation of ‘charity clone towns.’ 

There are now 10,000 charity shops - which enjoy generous tax breaks - prompting claims that they are fuelling the decline of high streets by forcing traditional retailers out.

But a report by think tank Demos this week claimed the stores actually boost local businesses by keeping shoppers on the high street and drastically reducing the number of empty stores.

Ms Portas, who runs 11 stores for Save the Children, agreed that charity shops had a ‘vital role’ to play saving the high street.

‘Some, however, are a bit smelly and need sorting out and can pull a high street down,’ she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘I think you could make them a little bit more lovely to be in.

‘That doesn’t mean that prices have to go up ‘If you create a charity shop that is a beautiful, respectful place people will give you great stuff and actually respect it in a better way, which in turn makes more money for charity.

‘My charity shops are the highest earners within Save the Children because we have done that.‘We have actually put at the centre of it ‘respect and something lovely.’ ‘It doesn’t have to feel like it’s a sad, sad face on the high street.’

The number of high street charity shops has risen 30 per cent since the start of the credit crunch in 2008, recent research by the Local Data Company found.

Charity shops pay a fraction of the £7 billion annual business rates of traditional retailers, giving them a considerable financial advantage over other stores.

They are also attractive to landlords, who avoid paying the business rate, while the charity can claim relief on it.

Ms Portas urged councils to offer all new businesses the same rate relief given to charity shops to encourage diversity on the high street.

She said anything that encouraged more people onto the high street - whether that was libraries or yoga studios - was welcome.

The Demos study found that charity shops help combat unemployment, with over 80 per cent of volunteers in the stores saying they were using their shifts as an opportunity to gain retail experience as a path to paid employment.

Jonathan Birdwell, from Demos, said the decline in high streets was due to out of town retailers and internet shopping.

He said: ‘Charity shops are helping to maintain some vitality to high streets ‘They are not causing the decline of high streets, they are helping to maintain them.’ 

Warren Alexander, of the Charity Retail Association, said: ‘Charity shops not only raise vital money for their parent charities but they bring huge value to their local communities and this report gives some clear insight into those benefits.

‘Charity shops offer a space for individuals to learn new skills and experience through volunteering and work.’

The Portas Review, published two years ago, selected 12 towns to receive £1.2million of taxpayers’ cash for high street renewal schemes.
