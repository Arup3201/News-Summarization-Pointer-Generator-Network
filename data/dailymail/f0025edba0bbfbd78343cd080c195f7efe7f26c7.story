Jimmy Greaves, who remains one of England and Tottenham's greatest strikers, celebrates his 75th birthday today.

He ranks as his country's fourth-highest goalscorer with 44 and tops the chart for Spurs with 268 strikes.

Greaves started his career at Chelsea, finding the back of the net 132 times in 169 appearances before a short stay with AC Milan.

But it was at White Hart Lane that he enjoyed his most successful spell, spending nine years in north London before a move to West Ham.

Now, as the Hammers take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday, Sportsmail looks back at the most iconic pictures of a football legend.
