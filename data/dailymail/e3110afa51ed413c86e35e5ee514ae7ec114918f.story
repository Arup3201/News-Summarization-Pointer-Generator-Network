Sentenced: Marian McGlinchey, also known as Marian Price (left), leaves Belfast Crown Court today after being spared jail for her part in the 2009 County Antrim bomb attack

Old Bailey bomber Marian McGlinchey has avoided returning to jail for dissident republican terror offences after being handed a suspended sentence.

The 59-year-old, who was given a life term in 1973 for her part in the bomb attack on the London court, last year admitted to providing a mobile phone to the Real IRA gang for a 2009 attack that killed two British soldiers.

She was caught on CCTV buying the device – which was then used by the terror group in the attack on Massereene Army barracks in 2009.

Royal Engineer soldiers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar were shot dead by gunmen as they stepped outside their compound in Antrim to collect a pizza from two delivery men.

Two other soldiers and two civilians were wounded when more than 60 shots were fired from a car at the servicemen, who were wearing desert fatigues and were due to be deployed to Afghanistan the next day.

But today, Judge Gordon Kerr QC sentenced McGlinchey, also known as Marian Price, to one year suspended for three years.

McGlinchey, who also pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a masked man who read out pro-violence propaganda in 2011, was released early from her jail term after seven years.

A lawyer for the republican, from 
Stockmans Avenue in west Belfast, claimed another jail term would 
exacerbate her chronic physical and mental health problems.

She was sentenced to 12 months for providing the phone in Antrim and nine months, to run concurrently, for hosting a dissident speech promoting attacks on the police at a 2011 rally in Londonderry.

Part of her sentence includes nine months for aiding a man promoting violence against police in 2011

In the wake of the incident in 2011, then-Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson revoked her life sentence release licence, which had been imposed when she was freed.

In the latter part of that two-year stint in custody she was held in a hospital mental health unit setting before being re-released by Parole Commissioners on health grounds.

Judge Kerr said her deteriorating health was one factor he had considered when suspending the sentence, as well his assessment that McGlinchey posed a low risk of re-offending and the fact that she had served a period of custody in respect of the breach of her licence conditions.

McGlinchey and her sister Dolours Price were arrested at Heathrow hours after they were involved in placing bombs outside the Old Bailey in 1973.

One man died of a heart attack and more than 200 people were injured.

Later they both went on hunger strike in their battle to be transferred from jail in  England to Northern Ireland.In the 1990s they became fierce critics of Sinn Féin and its president, Gerry Adams, calling his peace strategy a sell-out.
