The head of the white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood of Texas has pleaded guilty to a racketeering conspiracy that included murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking.

Larry Max Bryan, 52, who goes by the name 'Slick' pleaded guilty on Friday before U.S. District Judge Sim Lake in Houston.

Under federal law, Bryan could be sentenced to up to life in prison. The plea agreement calls for prosecutors to recommend the 52-year-old be sentenced to no more than 25. Sentencing is set for Oct. 7.

Bryan was among nearly three dozen people allegedly affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood who were charged in a sweeping indictment unsealed in 2012.

Dozens of defendants have been convicted in an ongoing federal investigation of the military-style gang founded in Texas prisons in the 1980s to offer protection to white inmates.

According to The Houston Chronicle, Bryan will probably need to serve his prison sentence far from the Texas State prison system where he became the head of a gang of prisoners.

Bryan has been in prison for all but 5 years of his adult life.

While the Aryan Brotherhood is a gang, authorities have said that they are absolutely nothing like the mafia.

Malcolm Bales, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, said it is unfair to compare the brotherhood to the Mafia – because they are so dysfunctional.

‘What we noticed is that they tend to beat up on each other a lot,’ he told Chron.com back in 2012.

‘We continue to get information about people who have disappeared, and the level of violence associated with their organization is something that we cannot tolerate.

‘I don't compare them to the Mafia. They are too weird and dysfunctional in how they handle their lives - heavy drug use and sociopathic personalities.’

The code among the brothers – inspired by their Christian beliefs – is one of ‘God forgives, brothers don’t'.

Texan authorities were able to finally dismantle the leadership of the Aryan Brotherhood in 2012.

34 members of the white supremacist group have been prosecuted for federal crimes and another 30 are locked up inside state prisons, Chron.com reported.

An 80-person taskforce, led by Army Reserve lieutenant colonel Richard Boehning, spent years tracking the group down.

The five divisions of the brotherhood all operated in separate ways according to the quirks and personalities of their general.

But all are fiercely loyal to one another – and addicted to meth, Texas Department of Public Safety agent Brandon Bess discovered when he interviewed them.

One of the leaders Steven Cooke who was reviled as one of the most controlling leaders, demanded that a group of 12 to stand round one of their members in a circle and open fire on them.

He had dishonoured the group by stealing an officer’s girlfriend, a gun and drugs.

Cooke was eventually jailed after his own wife testified against him.

Another one of the leaders, Terry Sillers, was caught on his Harley Davidson after a police chase.

General Frank Roch Jr died last year aged 59 after apparently suffering a heart attack inside a parked truck. Another one of the generals, Carl Carver, was locked up after ordering a hit.

A gang member and his girlfriend were shot in the head from close range after being lured into the countryside.

Carver was locked up for life after admitting racketeering and violence charges.
