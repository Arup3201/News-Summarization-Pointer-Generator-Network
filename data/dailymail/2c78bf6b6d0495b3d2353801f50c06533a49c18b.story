A woman who was told she was too big to be a model has proved the critics wrong by landing her dream job - despite being bigger than she was before.

Mother-of-three Charlotte Joines first attempted her modelling career aged 22, but failed to land a contract with an agency because her size eight figure was deemed too big.

Ten years on and Charlotte has finally landed her dream job as a swimwear model, despite now being a size 12.

Charlotte, who was told she was too big to be a model, has proved the critics wrong by landing her dream job - despite being bigger than she was before

At size 12 Charlotte won a national competition and now is pursuing a career as a swimwear model

Charlotte, now 32, said: 'The lady at the agency took a long hard look at my thighs and told me they were too big.

'I’d been surviving on just Weetabix and going to the gym five times a week so that was the final straw.

'I already had one child then and I was sacrificing too much. I had no energy and I was grumpy all the time.'

Charlotte, from Portsmouth, decided she wanted to become a model after getting fed up of her boyfriend Floyd looking at other women in magazines.

She said: 'I thought I’ll give him something to look at - I can do that.

'So I had some shots done and sent them off to everyone. I got a few jobs but I kept getting knocked back from agencies.

'People said it was the nature of the industry and I should have known was I was letting myself in for, but every one took a little bit out of my confidence.

Charlotte entered the competition to represent Curvy Kate with three friends, Camilla, Ellesha and Rufaro, and the group were chosen as the winners by singer Sarah Harding and photographer Dan Kennedy

After winning the competition, Charlotte took part in a bikini photo shoot despite have only having given birth four months previously

'I was exhausted and snappy, so when I got told I was too big I just couldn’t do it any more.

'Now I’m a size 12 and the most happy and confident I’ve ever been. I do think that confidence helped me to achieve my modelling dream.'

Charlotte took a break from modelling until she spotted a competition on television for a group of friends to model for underwear brand Curvy Kate.

She entered with three of her friends, never imagining they would get anywhere.

Instead they were invited to attend the semi-finals in London for a photo shoot by celebrity photographer Dan Kennedy and competition judge Girls Aloud’s Sarah Harding.

Charlotte and her friends modelled the brand's latest swimwear looks on their shoot in Ibiza

Mother-of-three Charlotte says she has never felt more confident with her body

Charlotte said: 'To be honest we thought it was just going to be a nice day out for me and my friends.

'We hadn’t seen each other for a while and thought it was a great opportunity to catch up, so we were shocked when they told us we’d got through to the final.

'The final was live on television and we were still convinced we wouldn’t win so it came as a huge shock.'

Charlotte, along with her friends Camilla Andersen, 27, Ellesha Newton, 28, and Rufaro Nyakatawa, 29, won a shoot in Ibiza and is now a swimwear models for Curvy Kate.

Charlotte said: 'When we had the shoot I had only give birth four months before so I was petrified.

'I had a wobble and nearly didn’t get there but it was great to have all my friends round to support me.

'I’m a size 12 now and the happiest I’ve ever been. Curvy Kate makes me feel like it doesn’t matter what size you are as long as you’re happy.

'It’s important that people know that being a size eight isn’t everything, just do what makes you happy.'
