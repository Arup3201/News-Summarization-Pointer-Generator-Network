Motorists are to benefit from a £200 million fund to end the curse of potholes which has worsened in the wake of the severe winter’s torrential rain and floods.

Councils will be able to apply for cash to fund road repairs and fill in the holes.

But while motoring groups and councils welcomed the extra cash, they said it wouldn’t go far enough and was itself likely to disappear just as quickly down a hole.

Motorists are set to benefit from a £200million fund announced by the Chancellor George Osborne in yesterday's budget. The money has been set aside to fix potholes that have resulted from the torrential rain and heavy floods this winter

But the RAC said the announcement does not go far enough. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC foundation, said the drip, drip funding does not address the £10billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified

Chancellor George Osborne told 
Parliament that the flooding had persuaded him to make an additional 
£140million to repair and maintain damaged flood defences.

But
 he stressed: ‘Our roads too have taken a battering.’

He singled out the
 MP for Northampton North who ad been ‘a persistent campaigner for 
resources to repair the pot-holes in his constituency and across the 
country.’ 

And he added:’His persistence has paid off and I’m making £200 million available which local authorities can bid for.’

Mr Osborne also announced a guarantee of up to £270 million to support the raising of debt finance for the Mersey Gateway Bridge.

The Government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the A1 north of Newcastle upon Tyne into Scotland, if funding is matched by the Scottish Government.

The Welsh Government can use existing powers to begin investing in improvements to the M4.

And UK Government is also financially supporting the Greater Cambridge enterprise partnership’s transport plans in a deal worth up to £500million over 15 to 20 years.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation said: ‘A succession of bad weather, including the recent floods, has wrought havoc on our roads and any money to fill the potholes is welcome.

But he added: 'The drip, drip of funding does not address the £10billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified.

‘It is also disappointing that this money has to be bid for. This creates a bureaucratic burden and means not all councils and drivers will see the benefits.’

Tony Ball, vice chairman of the Local Government Association’s economy and transport board, said: ‘We are pleased that the Government has responded to our calls for extra funding to tackle potholes.’

But he added; ‘This announcement does not go anywhere near far enough.

'We urge the Government to provide a full and comprehensive package, including the resurfacing of roads, rather than funding in dribs and drabs.’

Mr Ball said: ‘We are facing a 42per cent increase in traffic on local roads by 2040 and there is a £10.5billion backlog of road repairs. The situation is getting worse every year because of a £500 million shortfall.’

There was relief that the planned 3p per litre September fuel duty rise was frozen and will not take place. But the Chancellor resisted calls to actually cut duty.

The AA said the freeze on duty, for a fourth year, was ‘very welcome relief for UK drivers’.

But AA president Edmund King said: ‘The freeze still leaves the squeeze on families and businesses that rely on four wheels to function and prosper.

A move to freeze the planned 3p rise in fuel duty was welcomed by the AA

‘Now that we know, from official figures, that inflation-hit earnings are effectively at 2002 levels and car use is struggling to revive, perhaps a short-term cut in fuel duty would have got the UK properly mobile again.’

RAC director Professor Glaister said: ‘The good news is that fuel duty has now been frozen since March 2011.

'The bad news is that the UK’s 37 million drivers still pay the highest proportion of petrol and diesel tax in Europe.

'Yet the stubbornly high pump prices mean transport costs remain a real concern for the record 18 million people who rely on a car to get to work.’
