I've you've ever wanted to spot wild and wonderful creatures on the Galapagos islands, scale Mount Everest or visit Captain Scott's hunt in Antarctica, but don't have the budget, all you need to do is log on.

You won't actually feel the snow beneath your feet, or breathe in the air of the Rio Negro, but neither will you exhaust your piggy bank.

Google Street View (GSV) is about to take you on a 360-degree adventure to some the world's most exotic destinations.

Up close and personal: You don't need to leave the comfort of your sofa to get a good look at the famous statue of Christ the Redeemer, in Rio de Janeiro

Christ the Redeemer - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

It's
 the city of the moment, but if you weren't lucky - or rich - enough to 
bag a ticket to the World Cup, GSV can take you to the 98ft Christ 
statue above Rio de Janeiro's Corcovado mountain. While you won’t be 
able to behold the full splendor of Corcovado on screen, you also won’t 
have to climb a 2,300-foot mountain.

Follow in Darwin's footsteps: The Galapagos Islands are a dream destination for wildlife fans, but you can 'virtually' visit without breaking the bank
