This terrifying collection of  shotguns, knives and samurai swords was discovered in the boot of a car carrying six British jihadists who plotted to kill and maim hundreds of people.

A nail bomb packed with 458 pieces of shrapnel and parts for a pipe bomb were also found.

The gang had evaded the security services and their car  was only searched after being impounded because the driver did not have insurance.

Scroll down for video of the arrests and the EDL rally

Plotters: Jewell Uddin, who was also linked to another terror plot, and Anzal Hussain who today admitted planning the attack on the EDL rally in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in June last year

Guilty: Mohammed Hasseen, left, and Omar Khan who today admitted their role at Woolwich Crown COurt

Court: Zohaib Ahmed and Mohammed Saud were also involved in the plot which only unravelled by chance

The terrorists plotted to detonate a bomb at an English Defence League rally, which would have caused hundreds of casualties, including police officers, bystanders and members of the far-Right protest group.

The terrorists now face lengthy jail sentences after admitting the plot – a protest against the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee – at Woolwich Crown Court yesterday.

The court heard that the men drove from Birmingham on June 30 last year to set off the bomb at the rally in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.

However, the meeting had finished early and by the time they arrived everyone had dispersed.

On the way back, the gang’s Renault Laguna was stopped by a policeman in a random spot-check on the M1. He impounded the car after discovering it was uninsured.

It later emerged that one of the terrorists had tried to insure it, but entered the wrong registration number on an online form.

The car was taken to a pound near Sheffield where it sat for two days until a worker found the weapons and ten copies of a note addressed to the Queen, David Cameron and ‘the enemies of Islam’.

Nail bomb: This 18-inch long device contains 458 pieces of shrapnel and was to be powered by explosives taken from at least two large fireworks

Explosive: Ball bearings and nails which were found inside the nail bomb when it was taken apart by police ballistics experts

Cache of weapons: A fearsome haul of knives which were found hidden inside the Laguna after it was pulled over because it had no insurance

It called the Queen a ‘female devil’ and accused her of ‘fooling a nation of blind sheep’. To the EDL, it said: ‘We love death more than you love life.’

Staff at the pound called the police, who called in counter- terrorism teams.

The next morning, Omar Khan phoned to ask if he could pick up the car and he and passenger Jewel Uddin were arrested, along with Mohammed Hasseen, who had not been in the car but whose fingerprints were found on the weapons.

Pipe bomb: These are parts of a partially put together pipe bomb which was seized by police

Other passengers Anzal Hussain, Zohaib Ahmed and Mohammed Saud were arrested after their taxi was stopped in Birmingham.

Police and MI5 had no idea about the plot, despite Uddin being named a ‘subject of interest’ in 2011 after he collected money for a terror cell, the members of which were jailed last week for more than 90 years for plotting suicide attacks using rucksack bombs.

Ahmed was on bail for separate terror charges, and Hussain was the brother of Ishaaq Hussain, who was jailed for 40 months for his part in the rucksack bomb plot.

Rally: The plotters were targeting this EDL rally in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, but were foiled because they arrived too late - after the crowds had gone

It also emerged that police and security services saw Uddin and Khan go into a shop in Birmingham five days before the planned attack.

They bought kitchen knives but police were keeping their distance and didn’t see the purchase.

Uddin, 27, Ahmed, 22, Khan, 31, Hussain, 24, Saud, 22, and Hasseen, 23, were told to expect ‘significant custody’ by Judge Nicholas Hilliard, QC, who adjourned sentencing until June 6.

Marcus Beale, head of the counter terrorism unit at West Midlands Police, said: ‘We do not believe that any one individual failed because the dots were there and they did not join them up.’

Caught on camera: Five of the men are seen on CCTV in Dewsbury at approximately 4.37pm - two hours after the EDL rally had finished

Terror targets: EDL demonstrators were the target of the Muslim extremists at the rally in Dewsbury last June

Attack plan: Around 750 EDL members, rivals from Unite Against Fascism and dozens of police officers were at the rally which the Muslim extremists were targeting

Rally: Penned in by police, these are the EDL protesters in Dewsbury caught on police video from a helicopter. The gang of Muslim fanatics were targeting the protest

Rally finished early: The event was shorter than planned because EDL leader Tommy Robinson, a crowd pleaser, was not able to attend

A series of coincidences saw the plan
 by Islamic fanatics to use bombs, guns and swords in a murderous attack
 on far-right extremists foiled.

Firstly,
 the five members of the gang who drove to the event on June 30 last 
year - all the men except Hasseen - made a mistake with their timing, 
arriving two hours late because the rally had finished earlier than 
expected.

The event was shorter than planned because EDL leader Tommy Robinson, a crowd pleaser, was not able to attend.

Seized: The group's Renault Laguna is stopped on the M1 motorway because it had no insurance and is seized - it was two days before the arsenal of weapons was discovered though

Then,
 as Khan and Uddin drove their silver Renault Laguna back towards 
Birmingham down the M1, it was recorded as uninsured when a traffic 
officer happened to carry out checks because the car looked old.

In
 fact the gang had tried to insure the Renault for one day that morning,
 but Saud had mistakenly entered the wrong registration number on an 
online form.

The car 
was seized because it had no insurance, and the officer took Uddin and 
Khan to a nearby train station so that they could get home.

It was taken to a pound near Sheffield by Woodhead Motors, and left there until the following Monday morning.

Staff
 then checked the contents of the car and found the gang's array of 
weapons including two shotguns, swords, knives, a nail bomb and a 
partially assembled pipe bomb, along with a hate-filled note ranting 
about the enemies of Islam.

It
 was only then that counter-terrorism units were called in, despite the 
fact that police and security services already had Uddin under low-level
 surveillance because he was on the periphery of another terrorist plot.

Held: Traffic police stop Jewell Uddin and Omar Mohammed Khan on the M1 as they travelled back to their home town, Birmingham and seize the vehicle

This
 was the plan by another group of extremists from Birmingham to set off 
up to eight rucksack bombs and possibly other devices in an attack that 
they wanted to be bigger than July 7.

Uddin
 had been seen with Khan going into a shop five days before the rally, 
but no officer followed them into Home Choice in Sparkhill because 
contact would have been too close.

In fact they were going to buy the kitchen knives that were among the weapons that the gang planned to use.

Neither
 counter-terrorist police or the security services had any intelligence 
to suggest that the men planned to stage an atrocity.

After
 their weapons were found, bomb squad were called to make the 
shrapnel-filled rocket safe, and said afterwards that it was 'viable', 
with the potential to cause serious injury or death.

Counter-terrorism
 teams launched a fast-moving operation, tracing Khan, who had initially
 given a false name, and his passenger by scouring CCTV.

Khan
 had the gall to call the pound to say that he needed to get something 
from the car, but unbeknown to him he was already under surveillance.

Police believe that he made the nail bomb because his fingerprint was discovered on the sticky side of tape found on the device.

West
 Midlands Police counter-terrorism unit also discovered that the Laguna 
was travelling with a gold Rover 25, and again used CCTV pictures to 
trace the three occupants.
