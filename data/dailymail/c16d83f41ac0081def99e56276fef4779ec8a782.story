England were short of runs, and appropriate bowling skills, as Kumar Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka to a six-wicket win in the fourth one-day international at the Premadasa Stadium.

James Taylor's breakthrough innings of 90, in just his third ODI and first in 15 months, was the major contribution in a patchy 265 all out - stand-in captain Eoin Morgan (62) doing his best too to try to salvage a par total after choosing to bat on a dry pitch.

But it did not quite stretch the hosts, Sangakkara (86) sharing a stand of 96 with Mahela Jayawardene and Angelo Mathews finishing the job with an unbeaten 51 - farming an attack surprisingly loaded towards seam rather than spin - to keep Sri Lanka always just ahead of the game.

Whereas they used 36 overs of spin, Morgan had only 10 available to him from a frontline slow bowler - and Sangakkara took routine advantage, easing past his third successive half-century and hitting seven fours in all from 105 balls.

England were flattered that victory came with only two balls to spare - and from 3-1 down, they must win all the remaining fixtures if they are to somehow start their World Cup winter with a series success.

James Taylor came in at No 3 and scored 90, but couldn't prevent England from falling to another defeat
