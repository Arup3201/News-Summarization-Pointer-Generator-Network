Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has taken a double swipe at Arsenal - 29 days before the start of the season.

The Portuguese, speaking at his unveiling as a BT Sport ambassador, claimed summer signing Cesc Fabregas never wanted to return to the Emirates Stadium this summer and said Jack Wilshere has set a poor example to children after he was caught smoking in Las Vegas last week.

Mourinho pulled off a coup by signing Fabregas from Barcelona earlier this summer, despite the fact Arsenal had first option on the midfielder.

Mastermind: Jose Mourinho missed his own son's football match to sign Fabregas for Chelsea

The Spaniard's move to Stamford Bridge came as a shock given his emotional ties with the Gunners, who he captained.

Fabregas had indicated Arsenal snubbed the chance to re-sign, but Mourinho claims the midfielder never intended to go back to north London and says it it took him just 20 minutes to clinch his signing.

'How did I persuade him? I spoke to him for about 20 minute,' said Mourinho.

'I think he really wanted to come. Arsenal had an option where they could interfere, but I don't' think he was open to that. He was in our direction so it was easy for me.'

And the Special One had his say on the smoking controversy that has engulfed Wilshere this week.

The Gunners midfielder was photographed smoking and behaving outrageously during a holiday in Vegas.

It was the second time in nine months Wilshere has been snapped with a cigarette in his mouth, despite his protestations that he is not a smoker.

And Mourinho says the England midfielder is not fulfillng his status as a role model after his Vegas escapade.

'What football players do, millions and millions are watching, lots of kids are watching,' said the Blues boss.

'I’m not a specialist, obviously, but I don’t think if a football player smokes one cigar or cigarette with friends in the summer when he is not training – I don’t think it affects his performance.

'What gets affected is that a kid at home says if a top football player can smoke then I can smoke and it is not a problem.

Got his man: Mourinho claims the signing of Felipe Luis represents a 'fantastic job' for his club

'It is more a social consequence than a physical consequence.

'Would I be angry if it was my player? Being angry is not a solution but I would just explain exactly that, that everything they do or wear is part of the kids’ life.

'If they smoke, maybe the kids think they do it a lot of times and they will probably do the same.'

Meanwhile, Mourinho insists Chelsea have finished their summer spending after completing their £16million move for Filipe Luis.

The deal for Atletico Madrid left-back Luis was rubber stamped yesterday, adding to the captures of Fabregas and Diego Costa.

Mourinho said: 'I have to say my club did a fantastic job, not just because of what we bought, but that we did it in almost in record time. 

Final piece: Felipe Luis is the last signing Chelsea will make this summer according to their boss

'We have closed our market today. We knew the targets the club attacked them at an early stage. I don't think we will sign anyone else, we are happy with what I have.

'I'm square about the other teams, I'm just so happy with my squad and confident with what I have in my hands.'

The Blues boss is still awaiting the return of his heartbroken Brazil internationals following their humiliating World Cup exit to Germany.

Oscar, Ramires and Willian were part of Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad that slumped to that embarrassing 7-1 loss to the eventual world champions.

But Mourinho does not fear for his Samba stars, and has revealed he felt some of his Brazilian's had one eye on the World Cup during the closing stages of last season.

'I was more worried last season. Last season I felt them too much connected with the World Cup and we were January February and March and I was feeling them already there and that really worried me, it as a difficult situation.

'Now it was a big disappointment but you have to move on from that in football. I’m waiting for them and I don’t think it will be a problem.

I have to try to use it in a positive way – you didn’t succeed so this season is important for you, lets change the image and the feelings and go back to what you are as what you were in the World Cup was your twin brother.'

Mourinho is also expecting this year's Premier League title race to be as competitive as ever.

He said: 'Last year, if you had asked me in July, I would never have said Man United would be outside the top four. This season I will tell you one (to miss out) and I have a big percentage of making a mistake.

'There were good teams last season and there will be better teams this season because everyone is investing. A few years ago you make a team to be champions and most probably you are champions. Now if you make a team to be champions, you try to finish in the top four.

'Why I like the Premier League so much is that at this moment, nobody knows who is going to win the title. I know that we want to and I know that we can, but it is the kind of competition where I can't say. At this moment, I think between us, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man United, Man City - who is going to be first, who is going to play in the Europa League, I don't know.'
