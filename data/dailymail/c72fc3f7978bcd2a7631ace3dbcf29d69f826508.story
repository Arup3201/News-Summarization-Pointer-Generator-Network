Prime Minister David Cameron said he had been assured by Spain that there would be no repeat of the opening of diplomatic bags

David Cameron today condemned Spain’s ‘extremely serious’ act of opening a diplomatic bag as Tory MPs called for warships to be sent to Gibraltar.

Spanish officials were compared to Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe yesterday after they violated international law by opening the British diplomatic bag at the border with Gibraltar.

The Prime Minister said it was a ‘breach of the principle of state immunity’ and vowed to stand up for British sovereignty.

The search of the bag is the latest incident in a growing diplomatic stand-off between Britain and Spain over the future of the Rock.

It is not known what was in the bag or why police wanted to search it, something that has not happened since a diplomatic bag was opened in Zimbabwe 13 years ago.

Mr Cameron said last Friday’s incident, in which Guardia Civil officers stopped a courier travelling from the Rock into Spain, must not be repeated.

He was challenged by Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former UN commander in Bosnia, to set out ‘further measures, political - and indeed any other measures - we can take towards Spain to stop this harassment of our people in Gibraltar’.

Mr Cameron told the House of Commons: ‘First of all, you are right to raise this because it is a breach of the principle of state immunity and the principles underlying the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. It is an extremely serious action that took place.

‘We asked the Spanish authorities to investigate urgently and they have done that. We have now received an explanation from the Spanish.

‘We are reassured that this will not happen again but let me be absolutely clear - we will always stand up for the rights of people in Gibraltar and the sovereignty of Gibraltar.’

Later Europe minister David Lidington was called to make an urgent statement to MPs on the breach.

He revealed that two bags had been opened by Spanish officials - despite being clearly marked as containing official UK correspondence and communications - in breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the principle of state immunity.

Mr Lidington told MPs that Spanish officials had explained away the latest incident by claiming it was the result of a mistake at a ‘junior operational level’ and insisted Britain's approach was working.

Tory MP Bob Neill urged ministers to 
‘redouble your efforts to explain through our Nato allies that the 
behaviour of the current Spanish government, which is frankly stooping 
to the levels of Franco's, is not that of a Nato ally and is not 
acceptable’.

He added: ‘Will you perhaps consider reinforcing the naval deployments available to us in Gibraltar?’

Tory
MP Peter Bone said he backed Royal Navy ships making a ‘goodwill visit’
to the UK overseas territory, adding ‘preferably a couple of gunboats’.

Fellow
Conservative Sir Edward Leigh questioned which warships are in the 
region and insisted the best way to preserve peace was by the strength 
of the Royal Navy.

He said: ‘What Royal Navy warships are
in place at the moment in the waters around Gibraltar and don't these 
provocations give a lie to those who complacently have argued for years 
now that the Royal Navy was not important? The best preservation of 
peace is the strength of the Royal Navy.’

Mr
Lidington replied: ‘I think that no-one in this Government has ever 
decried the importance of the Royal Navy and you would not, I'm sure, 
expect me to comment on ship deployments.’

Tensions
have risen since July after Gibraltar dropped concrete blocks in its 
waters to create what it said was an artificial reef to encourage sea 
life to flourish in a marine reserve

Others suggested the Spanish ambassador should be ejected from London.

Veteran Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman said: ‘If this alleged error by a jobsworth was the only act of interference and aggression by the Spanish authorities on the frontier with Gibraltar it might just get by.

‘But this is a whole succession of harassment after harassment after harassment and it will not do. The softly, softly approach of this Government is simply not working.’

He said that ‘if anything like this ever happens again, the Spanish ambassador should be expelled from this country’.

Conservative Andrew Rosindell also questioned whether the ambassador should be expelled immediately.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said: ‘We are entitled to press the Spanish government further as to what the protocol is and what is the understanding of those who have the responsibility for these matters at the border.’
