Ed Miliband today described himself as a 'child of immigrants' but vowed to  introduce a new bill to tighten rules on foreigners moving to Britain if he wins the next election.

The Labour leader, in Rochester and Strood ahead of next month's crunch by-election, said he was 'proud of the contribution' immigrants like his parents had made to Britain.

But he pledged new legislation would be introduced in the first Queen's Speech after the general election. Extra border controls and new powers to force public sector workers to speak English will be introduced as part of a wider package of measures passed 'within weeks' of a new Labour government, party sources said.

Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged immigration legislation in the first Queen's Speech after the general election as he campaigned in Rochester & Strood

Mr Miliband was campaigning before the November 20 Rochester and Strood by-election sparked by Conservative MP Mark Reckless defected to Ukip

A Conservative spokesman said: 'This is just pathetic posturing from Miliband...nothing he has promised today would actually reduce immigration. 

'Labour had an open-door immigration policy for 13 years.'  

Mr Miliband praised Labour's candidate in Rochester, Naushabah Khan, adding: 'Like Naushabah, I am the child of immigrants'. But he said abuses needed to be tackled.  

He said recruitment agencies banned from only hiring from abroad and companies employing people from outside the EU would have to create an apprenticeship.

There would also be a specific law against bringing in foreign workers to undercut wages in the UK, and a reintroduction of ‘counting in and counting out’ at borders.

He has been under pressure from some of his MPs to harden his line on immigration since Ukip came close to taking Heywood and Middleton, a supposed safe Labour seat near Manchester in a by-election this month. 

But speaking to Labour supporters in Chatham, Mr Miliband said he was also clear about what he ‘will not do’.

He said: ‘False promises on immigration just make people more cynical about politics. I will not be part of that.’

Mr Miliband said he knew the EU ‘needs to change if we are to deal with the problems of immigration’.

‘We will seek change in Europe for longer transitional controls when new countries join the EU,’ he said. Stopping child benefit and child tax credits being paid to kids living abroad. Doubling the period before people would be entitled to benefits. And stronger rules to deal with foreign criminals'.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage (left), speaking with the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Strasbourg yesterday, has described the by-election as the 'most important' in 30 years

But he highlighted David Cameron's failure to hit the target of bringing net annual immigration down to tens of thousands.

‘I will not make promises I cannot keep,’ he said. ‘I will never propose a policy or a course of action that would damage our country.

‘Nigel Farage wants to leave the EU, on which three million British jobs and thousands of businesses in our country depend ...

‘Now David Cameron is also saying he is ready to leave the EU and have Britain turn its back on the rest of the world.’

Mr Miliband declared: ‘I will not be a prime minister that puts either those jobs and businesses or our national interest at risk.

‘Labour offers real change right now, not damage to our country.’

Voters in the Kent town of Rochester will get the chance to return Ukip's second MP in the by-election next year

The speech comes with less than a month to go until the by-election triggered by Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories to Ukip.

A new poll has suggested Mr Reckless is on track to retain his seat on November 20, with 43 per cent support to 30 per cent for the Conservatives. Labour are trailing on 21 per cent.

In a direct appeal to traditional Labour voters not to shift allegiance to Nigel Farage's Ukip, Mr Miliband said: ‘If you want a party for working people, then vote Labour in this by-election, for clear, credible and concrete change.’
