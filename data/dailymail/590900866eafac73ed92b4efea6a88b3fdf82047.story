White House Ebola response coordinator Ron Klain will not appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday when it convenes a hearing on the federal government's response to the deadly viral outbreak.

The seldom-seen Klain, known in Washington as President Obama's 'Ebola czar,' has already skipped one Ebola-related hearing in the House of Representatives, held two days after he officially started on the job.

The high-profile November 12 Senate hearing would be a typical forum for him to answer questions about how the work of various cabinet-level agencies will be integrated together if Congress approves Obama's latest funding request.

But instead of risking tough questions during a public hearing, Klain privately briefed congressional leaders on Friday at the White House and appeared Tuesday on the administration-friendly MSNBC.

HE'S ALIVE: White House Ebola czar Ron Klain emerged from behind the scenes on Tuesday to talk with the Obama administration-friendly MSNBC

IN THE ROOM BUT NOT IN THE GAME: Klain (top, 2nd left) was flanked by CDC director Thomas Frieden and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell during a Nov. 4 White House Ebola meeting, and seated across from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson (foreground) -- but he's the only one of the group who won't testify

His TV appearance marked the hospital discharge of New York City doctor Craig Spencer, who has been declared Ebola-free after contracting the illness in western Africa.

'Today is a milestone,' Klain said. 'But let’s be clear ... we’re going to see occasional additional cases of Ebola in our country. This is not the last one.'

The White House has asked for $6.18 billion in emergency funding to fight the disease, including $4.64 billion to meet immediate needs and another $1.54 billion 'as a Contingency Fund to ensure that there are resources available to meet the evolving nature of the epidemic.'

Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the committee's chairwoman until Republicans take over the Senate in January, emphasized in her hearing announcement the need to attack Ebola on multiple fronts by deploying resources overseas, stopping Ebola at the U.S. border and supporting scientific advances.

One Senate aide to a committee Republican told MailOnline on Tuesday that Klain should appear personally to describe how he is coordinating these efforts for the benefit of lawmakers who weren't in Friday's high-level White House briefing.

'The whole idea of having an Ebola czar is turning out to be a big charade if he doesn't suit up to play,' he said.

'It just feeds this idea that the White House isn't willing to be transparent. If Klain is drawing a salary from the administration, he shouldn't be allowed to refuse to answer questions about what he's doing.'

The aide spoke on condition of anonymity.

A White House official told MailOnline that other witnesses who will show up 'will be senior representatives from the departments and agencies executing our Ebola response both at home and abroad.'

'They are well placed to discuss the emergency funding request,' he said.'

The official ignored did not respond to a question about what might be on Klain's calendar during the 2:00 p.m. hearing on Wednesday.

The administration is sending HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to Capitol Hill instead, along with CDC director Thomas Frieden, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, a top USAID coordinator and experts from the State and Defense departments.

Four of the eight witnesses will offer opening statements, an Appropriations Committee spokesman told MailOnline, but all of them will be available to answer questions.

Klain won't be among them. 

RON KLAIN WHO? Obama's 'Ebola czar' isn't exactly a rousing success, with 40 per cent of Americans saying they've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he's doing a good job

VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE: Just 34 per cent of Americans say they have faith in President Barack Obama to manage the Ebola crisis the right way moving forward

LOTS TO COORDINATE: Klain told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Tuesday that the United States will see more Ebola cases

The longtime Democratic Party operative who served a chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, has had a rough start in his role.

In a MailOnline/YouGov poll during the last days of October, just 10 per cent of Americans said they approved of his job performance. That's a lower number than the dismal ratings of Congress itself.

Fully 40 per cent of adults surveyed said they had never heard of him. 

Following the October 24 Ebola hearing in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California said it was understandable that Klain didn't appear since he was getting up to speed.

But 'we do not expect that that would be repeated if there’s a followup hearing,' he cautioned.

Ebola czar Ron Klain won't testify in Wednesday's Ebola hearing, but the White House is sending a cavalcade of other witnesses whose agencies' epidemic responses he is tasted with 'coordinating':

Sylvia Mathews Burwell, HHS Secretary

Accompanied by:

Jeh Johnson, Homeland Security Secretary

Heather Higginbottom, State Department Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources

Accompanied by:

Michael Lumpkin, Defense Department Assistant Secretary for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict 

Accompanied by:

Obama attracted criticism in 2009 for appointing 18 'czars' to advise him on everything from global warming to guns. Because none of them has legal authority –~ their role is limited to advising the White House – they're not subject to the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

That means, unlike cabinet secretaries, they don't have to withstand the scrutiny of a Senate confirmation hearing, and the Executive Office of the President can shield them from congressional hearings.

The late West Virginia Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd complained to the White House a month after Obama took office in 2009, saying that 'the rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the constitutional system of checks and balances.'

'At the worst,' Byrd wrote in February 2009, 'White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials. … As presidential assistants, they are not accountable to Congress, to Cabinet officials and to virtually anyone but the president.'

On the Republican side, Maine Sen. Susan Collins once threatened to hold up funding if White House czars aren't made available for congressional testimony.

She proposed legislation in September 2009 to do just that. It never got off the ground in a Senate controlled by Democrats.

'Many of these new "czars," she said on the Senate floor, 'appear to occupy positions of greater responsibility and authority than officials who already have been confirmed by the Senate.' 

'The appointments of so many czars have muddied the waters, causing confusion and risking miscommunication going forward,' Collins added.

'We need to know, with clarity: Who is responsible for what? Who is in charge – the czar or the Cabinet official? Who can Congress and the American people hold accountable for government policies that affect daily life?'
