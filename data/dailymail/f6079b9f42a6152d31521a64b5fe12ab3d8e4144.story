Simon Halford-Thompson is back on his feet at home in Laceby after both his legs were shattered in the horrifying incident in which he was nearly cut in half.

The 24-year-old was in a branch of the burger giant in Yangzhou in eastern China when a Mercedes ploughed into it.

A split-second later the Mercedes, with a drunk-driver at the wheel, crushes Simon at the counter

It's a chaotic scene, with debris everywhere and the takeaway worker cowering in shock

Simon was lucky not to lose the use of his legs after they were shattered in the accident, but he's now on the mend and making a good recovery at home

Simon, who was in China teaching English as a foreign language at the time of the incident in January 2012, was in hospital for seven months.

He had a cage surrounding his legs, which were held together with metal rods and plates.

Overcoming the trauma, Simon was determined to get back on his feet and playing football.

‘There was some anxiety when one doctor suggested the bottom of one of my legs might have to be amputated.

‘There was never too much worry about me being able to walk again. I took the view the accident had happened so there was not much I could do and there was no use moping around.’

Simon said: ‘I had lots of support from friends in China. My mum and sister wanted to come out to see me straight away but I thought it was better for them to wait until I got out of hospital.

‘When I got out it was fantastic to see them. I did not want to leave China. I did not want the experience to blight the great time I had there. I was only going to leave on my terms.’

The drink-driver was locked up for three months after admitting the offence, which was described as ‘stupid and negligent but not deliberate’.

Simon is now aiming to get a teaching job in Europe.

He has enjoyed playing cricket since he returned home and is also keenly following his favourite football team, Manchester United.

He said: ‘I want to thank my family and friends for their support.’

Simon is a graduate of the University of Leeds, where he studied international history and politics.

He said his aim to teach English as a foreign language was a way to see the world.

In China, he first taught in Sichuan near the Tibetan border before moving to Jiangsu in the east of the country. He had taught at the school for about three months before the crash.
