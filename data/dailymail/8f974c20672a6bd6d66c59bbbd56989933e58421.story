It's the biggest week of the year for chocolate sales, eclipsing demand at Christmas and even Valentine's Day.

And just in time for Easter, one of the world's foremost food scientists - Bernard Lahousse - has explained why Easter eggs taste so good. 

According to Mr Lahousse, it's all down to smell of chocolate which, when presented in Easter egg form, is enhanced.   

Happy memories associated with Easter firmly anchor positive feelings towards chocolate eggs

Mr Lahousse told FEMAIL:  'The smaller the chocolate layer is, the easier the chocolate will melt. 

'So that is the advantage of Easter eggs; they melt easily and the aromas of the chocolate come into your nose quite fast.' 

There are a number of reasons why chocolate tastes so good - and like Mr Lahousse explained - the majority of them have to do with the way chocolate smells. 

'Chocolate contains a lot of different aroma molecules,' he said. 

'It has roasted molecules and fruity molecules. 

'These molecules contain a lot of complexity which makes it possible for chocolate to be paired with a lot of ingredients.

 And it's not just the smell of chocolate that makes it so appealing. 

'There are a lot of taste components contained within chocolate,' Mr Lahousse continued. 

 'We have sweetness, bitterness and sourness. Plus we can't disregard  the fat component. This melts at body temperature and provides a nice sensation and fresh mouth feel in the mouth. 

So what happens to us when we eat chocolate? Why does it make us feel so good, so content... so happy? 

The small chocolate layers in an egg means we get an intense whiff of chocolate when we first bite into it

'Chocolate contains a molecule called phenylethylamine, which chocolate is loaded with,' the scientist continued. 

This molecule is said to inspire feelings of love, which is why we feel good when eating it. 

'Pairing chocolate with extra ingredients will enhance the feeling,' Mr Lahousse said. 

'For instance, by adding long pepper or black pepper it [the molecule] will have more effect.'

And finally it all goes down to pleasurable memories and the way your egg is presented to you. 

 'If you look at food more than half of experience lies outside of the taste. 

'You taste what you make out of it; when you wrap it in a nice package,  and it is presented to you by the people who love you, it will make the experience much better.'  

If you don't have the time to make chocolate from scratch, you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs.

Once your chocolate is melted, it will need to be tempered. The cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along, just pop your chocolate into the freezer (no longer than 30 seconds).

Place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it. Keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process. 

Stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature.

Bittersweet/ dark chocolate should reach a temperature of 28C-29C;  milk chocolate should reach 27C-28C; and white or coloured chocolate should reach 26C-27C.

Once the first batch has melted, add more chocolate to your bowl, stirring as you go along. As soon as the correct temperature is reached, start building your Easter egg layers. 

Spoon some chocolate into a mould (you can get them from Lakeland, Denny Craft Moulds or Party Delights) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould. 

You can make it as thick as you like, building each layer as the previous one cools. 

Once the final layer has been built, leave aside to cool and harden before decorating.
