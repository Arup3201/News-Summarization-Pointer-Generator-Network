The heir to a vast but abandoned English
estate has been revealed as a talented, free-spirited college professor with connections to the legendary aviation family the Lindberghs.

John Figg-Hoblyn died on June 12, 2011 aged 85 at a nursing home in California. For more than 40 years, the heir had little to do with his Hoblyn estate in Cornwall with its enormous manor house and 300 acres worth $7.5million

Following years of legal 
wranglings over the estate's century-old will, it was finally sold this year. 
The proceeds, amounting to almost $4million, will be split between Mr Figg-Hoblyn's 
two elderly sisters Anne and Margaret in California.

How the life of a Stanford University-educated ancestor of English gentry spiraled into bankruptcy and ill health, has been revealed to MailOnline by Mr Figg-Hoblyn's close friend Ron Libert.

John was born and raised in Santa Barbara County, California with his sisters Anne and Margaret (known as Peggy).

His father Francis was a high school principal in the area. Mr Figg-Hoblyn's mother liked to travel and lived separately from their father once the three children had grown up.

Free spirit: John Figg-Hoblyn was educated at Stanford, loved nature and adventure stories

As a young man, John studied at Stanford University, where he was on the track team and excelled in his major Biology.

In the summer, he went on college expeditions to identify native fauna in regions like the Gulf of California.

Mr Figg-Hoblyn was a close friend of the second son of aviator Charles Lindbergh.

Jon Lindbergh was a renowned diver and a pioneer of cage diving who studied marine biology at Stanford.

In his youth, John Figg-Hoblyn was extremely handsome but, according to Mr Libert, had no known romances and he never married.

After gaining his Masters degree, Mr Figg-Hoblyn took up a teaching post at Stanford and later taught at San Jose University.

Upon the death of his father in 1965, John moved into the family home in Santa Barbara with sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean.

His sister Margaret, who was around ten years younger than John, also attended Stanford University.

Margaret, known as 'Peggy', was involved in organic agriculture and established the Farmers' Market in Santa Barbara alongside her elder brother.

Around 2005, Mr Figg-Hoblyn suffered a
stroke and his sister became his only carer, defying any use of Western
medicine and relying on her own remedies.

The brother and sister moved to the Ojai Valley in Ventura County the following year.

 He told MailOnline: 'I met John and Margaret in late 2006 and 
decided to help them with their legal problems. I visited with John 
frequently and I would take them to church on Sundays.

'They
ended up living in an old camper and were content, having no debts and 
living quite simply on their combined Social Security checks of $1,400 
monthly.

'John only talked to people he felt 
comfortable with. He could read out loud in a strong voice and loved to 
read adventure stories and stories of the Old West.'

However
Mr Libert said that the fortunes of the free-spirited Mr Figg-Hoblyn 
changed when a relative filed a lawsuit to become 
John's guardian.

Mr 
Libert added: 'Peggy ignored the court summons until an attorney 
representing the Probate Court served them personally.  From that day 
on, their life spiraled down hill.'

Mr
Libert had a friend represent Mr Figg-Hoblyn pro bono - where a judge 
handed over guardianship to Bank of America, including his possession 
and Social Security checks.

His friend continued: 'It was then reported that Margaret was not taking good care of John. He was placed in a ''guest home'' subject to only approved visitors and limited outings.'

Following the death of the rightful heir to Hoblyn estate two years ago, the property and vast lands once again were open to dispute. 

The next male heir - the only person who wanted to restore the estate to its former glory - has been left with a vastly reduced sum because of a change to the century-old will.

The legal document had originally said that only a male heir could inherit the lands and 19th-century Fir Hill manor house.

John Figgs-Hoblyn never indicated to the British High Court that he wanted to accept Hoblyn Estate after the death of his father Francis in 1965.

This meant it was prevented from passing to the second-in-line, his cousin and only male heir, John Westropp Figg-Hoblyn. 

The retired farmer and father-of-four from Missouri said that he  wanted to live and work on the family estate. The British courts recognized Mr Westropp as a legitimate heir.

However because of the legal impasse, Hoblyn Estate lay empty. Over the years, the mansion fell into disrepair after lying empty and unloved while the land and gardens became overgrown.

Parts of the estate were sold off to pay death duties and administration costs.

Mr Figg-Hoblyn's death allowed the destiny of the estate to be decided by a judge at the Court of Protection in London.

An original clause which said the estate would pass to a male heir was cut out and the sale proceeds of the
estate split between John Paget's next-of-kin, his elderly sisters in 
California.

Some £130,000 (around $200,000) will go to the closest surviving male heir, John Westropp, their cousin.

Britain's Official Solicitor, who deals with such property matters, tried in vain to contact John Figg-Hoblyn about his vast inheritance 30 years ago.

In 1985, the Official Solicitor wrote: 
‘John Paget Figg-Hoblyn, by the stroke of a pen and by meeting some 
other details, can take over the property.

'Yet I do not know his 
address.’

The history of Hoblyn Estate has long been marked with scandal and family tragedy.

In 1856, William Paget Hoblyn was the first to move into Fir Hill Manor. He lived there in grandeur with his wife, son and four daughters.

However their idyllic life came to be tainted by a bitter legal battle surrounding William Paget Hoblyn's will.

The estate, according to legal documents drawn up by a previous owner, was intended to pass to the eldest male heir.

However William Paget Hoblyn also wanted his daughters to share in the property.

However
Hoblyn's eldest son Ernest, a known heavy drinker, challenged the legal
changes while his father was still alive.

Ernest lost the battle 
against his sisters soon after his father died and shortly before his 
own early death.

The 
Cornish estate was then thrown into turmoil. With only four Hoblyn 
daughters left - all spinsters and with no male heir - no one could 
inherit the house and lands.

Two remained spinsters and one married 
but did not have children. And the fourth sister scandalized local 
society with her love life.

When she was 19, she ran off to South
Africa with coachman John Jones who was in his thirties and married 
with four sons. Rosalind soon regretted her actions.

The Western Morning News reported in April 1882:
‘The unfortunate girl’s story was a pitiful one. 'She wished herself 
back home within 24 hours of leaving, and left her swain distinguishing 
himself as a waiter at an hotel.’

Her parents were on the dockside to greet her on her return to Plymouth, Devon.

She found a more suitable partner in Thomas Richard Figg, a tea broker's son, and they married in March 1884.

The couple moved to Canada and then to California, and their four children took the surname Figg-Hoblyn.

Rosalind’s
eldest son Francis Figg-Hoblyn, a gold miner in California, was due to 
take over the estate on the deaths of his mother and Cornish aunts.

In
1947, he visited the estate and invited the tenant farmers to a meeting
at Colan to announce his intention of restoring the estate to its 
former glory.

However 
Francis was annoyed that his elderly aunts had let the estate become run
down. He would not sign a document saying that he was satisfied the 
estate and would take it on.

He
returned to California and died in 1965. The estate then passed to his 
eldest son John Paget where the legal wranglings continued until this 
year.

Derek
Luscombe, vice-chairman of Colan Parish Council said recently that he 
was delighted the long-running will dispute was finally settled. He said
it gave a chance for the estate to be rejuvenated.

Mr Luscombe said
that just before Christmas, Charlie Hoblyn, a distant cousin of John 
Paget, addressed Colan Parish Council with plans to open a new campsite 
on part of the estate he had just bought. That plan will be subject to 
planning approval from Cornwall Council.

‘Most people have forgotten the estate is there because the dispute went on so long,' Mr Luscombe added. But I think locals will be pleased to know it's finally been settled.’
