President Obama will be a huge financial winner even if he loses the election - and could make  millions of dollars in book deals and public appearances.

The 44th President of the United States could earn a fortune on the lecture circuit if he was forced to leave the White House, according to political experts.

The lucrative template was set by former president Richard Nixon 
who earned a fortune on leaving the Oval Office, even though he was forced to quit 
in disgrace over the Watergate affair.

Every president since, including George W Bush, has worked their contacts and experience for the benefit of their bank balance.

Larry Sabato, a respected political scientist at the University of Virginia, said: ‘You never have to worry about an ex-president eating. Being a former president is a ticket to printing money. That’s all it is.

‘When we elect someone president, we nearly guarantee he will become a one-hundred millionaire.’

If Obama loses the election, he will likely return to his $2million red-brick, Georgian Revival home in a middle-class neighborhood on Chicago's South Side along with wife Michelle and daughters, Malia, 14, and 11-year-old Sasha.

A huge cash windfall would probably be the first time in his life that he would have some serious money. Earlier this year, Obama admitted that it took him 13 years to pay off his student debt and finally cleared his decks in 2004.

In the same year, the Obamas reported an income of $207,647 - the kind of money he could make from just one speech.

In 2005, he became Illinois state senator, earning $162,100 a year, while Michelle was the breadwinner on $316,962 for handling community affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center.

According to Fox Business, Obama could follow the example of Clinton who has had the most successful post-presidency of all time - at least when it comes to making money.

He left office in 2001 with huge legal debts from the Lewinsky sex scandal but last year alone raked in $13.4million in speaking fees.

Clinton earned a $15million advance for his 2004 autobiography My Life and can command up to $750,000 for a single appearance, which is nearly twice the President’s annual salary of $400,000.

According to CNN, Clinton has pulled in $89million from speeches alone. In one speaking engagement, Clinton himself joked: ‘I never had any money until I got out of the White House, you know, but I've done reasonably well since then’.

Obama could also follow the example of Nixon who paid off his $1million legal fees after Watergate with the $2million he earned from his memoirs in 1978.

He also worked with British TV host Sir David Frost for the famous series of interviews which went on to inspire the film Frost/Nixon.

Nixon was paid $600,000 and a slice of the profits -  $2.29million.

Sabato said: ‘He [Nixon] resigned in disgrace. Yet he made money hand-over-fist between interviews, books and lectures.'

Nixon’s successor Gerald Ford followed his example and joined the boards of businesses including Commercial Credit and Tesoro Petroleum.

Ronald Reagan was paid $2million to make a speech in Japan after he left the White House.

According to the Center for Public Integrity, George W Bush coined in $15million for 140 speeches in the three years after he left the White House.

Ron Bonjean, a partner at PR firm Singer Bonjean Strategies in D.C., said the presidency was a ‘huge windfall’.

He said: ‘If President Obama were to leave office I don’t think he’d be part of the middle class. He’d be part of the 1 per cent.'
