A teenage racing driver has been rushed to hospital with critical burns after his car flipped in a practice session at a western Sydney race track.

The 17-year-old Queenslander, Brock Giblin, was driving a Mazda 3 MPS when it rolled several times at Sydney Motorsport Park on Friday morning, a statement released by Shannons Australian Motor Racing Nationals said.

Paramedics were called to Eastern Creek race track just before 11am to attend to the teenager who drives for Osborne Motorsport.

But not before his 'brave' team mates, Ryan McLeod and Matt Cherry, attempted to help Giblin who was trapped inside the vehicle after the car flipped and burst into flames. Eventually he was freed by emergency service crews.

Osborne Motorsport owner Colin Osborne said Giblin had 'experienced significant burns' but was in a 'serious but stable' condition.

'At the present time, investigations at the hospital indicate that his burn injuries are the only area of concern,' he said in a statement.

'Brock is currently being readied for transfer to a specialist burns unit in Sydney.'

Mr Osborne said the precise cause of the accident was under investigation but it was 'apparent' that fire the result of the accident not the cause.

He is a Year 11 student at Maleny State High School on the Sunshine Coast and had just joined the racing team

He added: 'We are confident that the cars construction, safety devices and the drivers safety apparel did their job to restrict any further injuries to Brock.'

Mr Osbourne said Giblin's father and team members were by the driver's bedside.

'Our thoughts are with Brock and his family at this time, and we hope for a quick recovery,' he said.

'The team has not yet decided if it will continue to participate in the Australian Manufacturers Championship round this weekend.'

The Osborne Motorsport team - including Giblin - were set to compete on Sunday in a round of the Shannons National circuit.

The young driver was transported to Westmead Hospital with reports that he has burns to 70 per cent of his body.

Richard Craill, media manager for the Shannons Australian Motor Racing Nationals series, told Drive.com the car had just performed a 'super-fast turn' before it went up in flames.

The teenager, from Landsborough on the Queensland's Sunshine Coast, joined the race team this year and is a Year 11 student at Maleny State High School.

In April, after finishing third in his class and seventh overall in his first race as part of the Australian Manufacturers Championships in Sandown, in Victoria, he gave an interview to ABC radio Sunshine Coast descibing the feeling of racing as 'magnificent'.

He also said he started racing by 'paddock bashing' around the family property in a Holden Barina.
