Public opinion about the First World War is too influenced by the sitcom Blackadder, the minister in charge of marking the centenary of the conflict has warned.

Defence minister Dr Andrew Murrison said commemorations next year were an opportunity to ‘balance’ the way the Rowan Atkinson series distorted the reality of the Great War.

But he insisted that the government was not trying to dictate ‘approved versions of history’.

An ambitious £50million programme of events is planned to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war in 1914.

Schoolchildren from every state secondary school will travel to the First World War battlefields as part of the commemorations, with communities across the UK urged to organise events.

During a Commons debate on the plans today, Dr Murrison said the events were a chance to ‘improve’ the nation’s ‘grasp’ of World War One.

He singled out Blackadder, and the 1960s Dirk Bogarde musical Oh! What A Lovely War, for distorting what people thought really happened on the frontline.

Dr Murrison, who was a surgeon commander with the Royal Navy serving in the Gulf War between 1990/91 and in Iraq in 2003, told MPs: ‘Improvement of our grasp of the causes, conduct and consequences of the First World War must be at the heart of the centenary that is about to break upon us.

‘Because there are those who are asking what's the point of it all, we risk disconnection from a defining event of our time and an opportunity, perhaps, to balance the Oh! What A Lovely War/Blackadder take on history, that has sadly been in the ascendant for the past 50 years.

‘And in its place I hope we will have a richer, deeper and more reflective legacy.’

Last month Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman said it was ‘astonishing’ that children were being shown Blackadder Goes Forth in school to teach them about the First World War, Jeremy Paxman.

He said he thought it was because ‘it is much easier to imagine the First World War with the help of other people’s imaginations’.

The Newsnight presenter said he believed people’s difficulty in understanding the war originated in the fact ‘we have been accustomed to seeing the First World War as poetry rather than history.’

In the Commons Dr Murrison said the events were even more important because there were no surviving veterans from the battlefields.

‘We must commemorate this centenary because with the passing in 2009 of Harry Patch, Bill Stone and Henry Allingham, our last tangible links with the First World War are retreating into the shadows,’ he said.

But he insisted that government would not dictate the terms of any such debate regarding the nation's understanding of war.

‘The role of government in the centenary, is to lead, encourage and help make it all happen, whilst avoiding the temptation to prescribe.

‘It is emphatically not the place of government in our 21st century liberal democracy handing down approved versions of history.’

Labour’s shadow defence minister Dan Jarvis said commemoration not celebration was the appropriate tone for events.

He added: ‘The facts of World War One cannot be counted in terms of just battlefield casualties or military innovations.

‘By dint of its influence and its timing, and the wider social change it brought about, it is the single most significant event of the 20th century.

‘As such, it is something we must commemorate, we must learn from, and we must educate our children about.

‘But above all we must remember, because it is only through remembering we will truly understand the impact World War One has had on British society and in doing so understand what it means to be British.’
