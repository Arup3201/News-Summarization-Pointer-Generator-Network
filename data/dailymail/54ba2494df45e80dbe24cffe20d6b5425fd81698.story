Disgraced congressman resigned his New York seat in 2011 after accidentally tweeting a photo of his groin

New account created using the handle @anthonyweiner instead of the doomed @repweiner that led to his demise

Weiner considering whether to run for NYC mayor later this year

Anthony Weiner, the disgraced Democrat, whose lewd Twitter photos of his bulging crotch led to him resign from Congress in 2011, is back tweeting.

Rather than some humble words or even something more profound, Weiner's first tweet was simply a link.

Those brave enough to click through were treated to his 64-point plan to restore the middle class in New York City.

Hello World: A 'fresh' start for Anthony Weiner on his new Twitter page.

Many view the plan as a campaign manifesto should he decide to run for mayor.

However, despite the former congressman wanting a 'fresh start' and launching a new account today with the handle @anthonyweiner, it is clear that Mr Weiner still does not know exactly how to use Twitter to his benefit.

His old scandalous Twitter account @repweiner still exists complete with post-bulge, pre-resignation messages. By creating this new account he loses his 68,000 followers.

That photo: The not-so-private crotch shot pic that led to Anthony Weiner having to resign

Weiner was a leading candidate to run the nation's largest city, until he derailed his political career with messages to women on Twitter and Facebook.

Weiner resigned from Congress in May 2011 amid a sexting scandal that involved him publicly tweeting lewd pictures of his crotch.

Pictures that were intended for a woman he was flirting with online instead went to tens of thousands of followers.

After a series of vehement denials, the married lawmaker finally admitted that he had exchanged racy online messages with several women and was forced to resign from Congress.

The seven-term Democrat initially claimed both his Twitter and Facebook accounts had been hacked but later admitted he had indeed sexted six women.

Porn actress Ginger Lee, Las Vegas blackjack dealer Lisa Weiss and Megan Broussard, a 26-year-old single mother from Texas, were among the women who claimed they had his photos.

He had been married to his wife, Huma Abedin for less than a year when the photos were discovered.

Since then, he's kept a remarkably low 
profile, staying out of the limelight and according to interviews that 
he's given, working on his marriage and looking after his young boy.

A return to Twitter could be seen as a signal that he is ready to be back in the public eye.

It is not the first time Weiner has been said to be plotting a return to public life.

He recently told the New York Times Magazine that he's considering a race for mayor this year.

'I don’t have this burning, overriding desire to go out and run for office,' Weiner told The Times. 'It’s not the single animating force in my life as it was for quite some time. But I do recognize, to some degree, it’s now or maybe never for me, in terms of running for something.'

If he does decide to run, he will face an uphill battle to overtake City Council Speaker Christine Quinn in the crowded Democratic primary for New York City Mayor.

Last week, Weiner reactivated anthonyweiner.com, his official website which had remained silent since his resignation.

The former congressman had largely stayed off Twitter and his @repweiner account for about 18 months, except to share a video of people in the Rockaways section of Queens who lost their homes in Hurricane Sandy.

Today, he simply tweeted his new Twitter handle to redirect followers.

Weiner had more than 5,000 followers on Monday evening.
