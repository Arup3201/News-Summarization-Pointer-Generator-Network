Robin Fleming, professor of history from Boston College, says Britons lived longer after the fall of the Roman Empire

What have the Romans ever done for us? The best thing they did was to leave, an historian has suggested.

Despite being credited for bringing roads, sanitation and medicine to Britain, amongst other things, studies show that Britons had a longer life expectancy after the fall of the Roman Empire. Research into graves dating from 400AD to 650AD show, on average, people lived for around two years longer after the Romans had left.

Robin Fleming, professor of history from Boston College in the US, said that once Roman taxes were lifted people were able to eat more nutritious food and thus lived longer.

Asked if the fall of the Roman Empire was good for Britain, Prof Fleming told the Daily Telegraph: ‘If you are a villa owner, no. But it you are part of the 97 per cent of the rest, then, yes, it might add a couple of years to your life which makes a difference.

‘The people were living longer after Roman Britain because they weren’t being taxed.‘

Life expectancy after the fall of the Roman Empire reached 35 for women who tended to die younger due to the dangers of childbirth, while men were usually dead by their early forties.

The research, which looked at graves from West Heslerton, a village in North Yorkshire, was presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in San Jose, California.

A famous Monty Python sketch from the 1979 film Life of Brian showed the character Reg, played by John Cleese, blasting the presence of the Romans and asking: ‘What have they ever given us in return?’

His comrades point out that the Romans introduced the ‘aqueduct, sanitation, roads, irrigation, medicine, education, wine, public order, hot baths and peace’, much to Reg’s irritation.
