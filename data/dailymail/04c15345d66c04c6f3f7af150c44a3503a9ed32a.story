A star high school student has been shot dead by a long range rifle while driving home from a party - just one day after graduating a year early.

Kayla Ferrante, 17, was driving back from a friend's house with her boyfriend to make her midnight curfew when someone fired the high-powered rifle into her car, striking her in the back.

Police in Tulsa, Oklahoma said they have no leads and cannot find a reason for the shooting that claimed the popular star pupil.

Tragedy: Kayla Ferrante, 17, (pictured with her mother) was shot in the back as her boyfriend drove her home from a graduation party. The teen was killed a day after graduating a year early

Determined to finish high school a year early to begin a career with special needs children, Kayla graduated from Memorial High School last Friday.

She was looking forward to a college class over the summer and had volunteer work lined up at a charity for special needs children and their families.

Following her graduation ceremony, friends and family gathered at her grandmother's house to celebrate at a party hosted by her parents.

She then went to a friend's house but texted her mother that evening, thanking her for the graduation party and telling her that she loved her.

Questions: Police have no leads into the shooting and do not know if the couple were targeted

Loved: The star student, pictured right in her graduation gown with her boyfriend, was looking forward to summer college classes and volunteer work with children with special needs

Hit: Kayla's boyfriend was driving her home to make her midnight curfew. They were just yards from her driveway when six shots were fired, with one hitting the car and Kayla

Later that night, her boyfriend was driving her home and was just a few yards from her driveway when six shots rang out at about 11.50 p.m.

One bullet from the high-powered rifle went through the car's license plate, through the seat, out of Kayla's chest and through the window as she sat in the car.

Her mother heard the shots from inside the house.

'I ran to her,' Roxanne Thornton told NewsOn6. 'She was slumped in the seat. I could see her bleeding. I put my hand over her to stop the bleeding.

'I begged her to stay with me. I told her I loved her. She mumbled something and rolled her eyes but wouldn't open them. She was still breathing; her heart was still pumping blood out of her.'

Distraught: Kayla's mother Roxanne Thornton heard the bullets and rushed outside to hold her daughter

Family: Kayla also leaves behind her father and younger brother, pictured at her graduation

Loss: Police have no leads but are investigating whether it was a case of mistaken identity

But Kayla died in surgery, leaving behind a devastated family, including a young brother.

Her
mother went on: 'I held her as she was dying in that car. I can't ever 
hold her again. I have to know why. There has to be an answer.'

Police
are now searching for answers as the family pleads for information. 
Homicide Sgt. Dave Walker said officers have no leads but they are 
ruling out accidental fire.

'We don't know the why of this, we don't know the who of this,' he said.

But he added to NewsOn6: 'Someone intended to shoot that car. We don't know why. If they were after the boyfriend or the victim - that we can't figure out just yet.'

Police are also investigating whether Kayla was murdered following road rage, or if it was a case of mistaken identity.

Impact: The bullet that killed Kayla went through the car's license plate (pictured), through the car seat and out of the teenager's chest. It exited through the window

Scene: Emergency services rushed to the car, centre, just before midnight but Kayla died in surgery

'We cannot understand who would do 
this or why and desperately want anyone with information to do the right
thing and come forward,' Roxanne and her husband Paul Ferrante said in a
statement.

'Kayla was doing nothing wrong. She wasn't in a place she shouldn't have been; she was just a girl coming home before curfew.'

Kayla's family remembered her as determined and caring, calling her 'a wonderful young woman who was a beloved daughter, big sister, niece, granddaughter, friend and girlfriend'.

'Kayla was always concerned for others, whether it was helping her friends through a crisis or being protective of her little brother or working with children on a recent mission trip,' her parents said.

Neighbours have set up a memorial outside the girl's home, where residents and friends have laid stuffed animals, flowers, wreaths and cards.

A memorial service will be held for the teenager on Thursday morning at Sandusky Avenue Christian Church. Her family are collecting contributions in her name to the Memorial High School Multi-Handicapped Fund.
