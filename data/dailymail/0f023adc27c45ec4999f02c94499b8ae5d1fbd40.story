Here's the latest accessory for all those lazy lads who want a short cut to the perfect figure - the world's first padded bra for men.

Ash Bhunnoo, 45, and accountant pal Ricky Robinson, 42, created the moob-masking vests for men who want to cover their untoned bodies.

The figure-hugging, long-sleeved t-shirts contain foam muscles to produce chiselled pecs, a flat stomach, broader shoulders and padded biceps.

Added boost: Mr Bhunnoo says that men can be as self-conscious about their looks as women and that he is 'selling them some confidence'

Mr Bhunnoo centre with models Perry Ripley, left, and Andreas Zekaqis, the pair have already sold more than 1,000 of the shirts to image conscious men

They have been designed with a special material which tenses and relaxes with the wearer.

More than 1,000 of the 'Funkybod Muscle Tops' costing Â£29.99 each have already been sold - with many going to the US and image-conscious California.

The advert boasts: 'Worn as a normal undershirt garment, the Funkybod top is a great confidence booster for men in the same way a padded bra works for women.'

Ash and Ricky - both ultra-fit amateur boxers - came up with the idea after noticing a growing number of friends hitting the gym to change their appearance.

Ash, a builder from Chatham, Medway said: 'Men can be as vain as women so we're just selling them some confidence.

'There are skinny guys who are perfectly healthy but when they go out on a Friday night they want to look a bit more buff.

'Women have always been into padded bras and that kind of thing.

'They've been around for years and guys now want a bit of the action too.

'Back when I was younger we were never like that.

'We would go out to the pub, have a drink and you might get a belly but it was alright.'

Father-of-two Ash added: 'A lot of our customers come from California.

'I don't know what it is about Americans and vanity but they just love it.

'People at the gym like them, and so do bouncers.'

Ash and Ricky took their idea to a product development company in London who helped them come up with the blueprint.

They funded a limited production run themselves and quickly sold out of their initial stock of 100.

The pair have now sold 1,000 via funkybod.com. which they are running from their homes while they carry on with their day jobs.

The vests come in four sizes from extra small to large and are available in either black or white.

No need for the gym: The shirts contain foam muscles to produce chiselled pecs, a flat stomach, broader shoulders and padded biceps
