A trainee teacher hanged himself on New Year’s Eve after a split from his girlfriend, an inquest heard today.

Keiran Walsh, 22, split from his partner of four years, Louise Doyle, so she could concentrate on her law degree.

But when the pair met at a party on December 31st, Keiran told his ex: 'I can't live without you'.

Miss Doyle then left the party but a few hours later Keiran sent her a final text saying 'I'm sorry' before he was found hanging in the bathroom at his university hall of residence on New Year's day. 

Childhood sweethearts: Trainee teacher Keiran Walsh, 22, dated Louise Doyle, 20, for four years before they broke up so she could concentrate on her law degree

The couple went to the same New Year's Eve party where Keiran hoped to get back together with his ex. When this didn't happen, he told her: 'I can't live without you'

An inquest in Cardiff heard how the former couple both went to a party being held at Keiran’s student flat.

Miss Doyle, 20, said Keiran appeared to think they were going to get back together that night, but when she told him that wasn't going to happen, they got into an argument.

Miss Doyle said: 'Keiran thought we were getting back together on New Year’s Eve and after a few drinks we would be normal.

'When that didn’t happened he didn’t know what to do.

'When we were arguing he said "I can’t live without you" - but he quickly backtracked and said he didn’t mean it like that.'

A few hours later, Keiran sent a text to his ex, saying: 'I'm sorry'. He was found dead in his bathroom the next day by friends

Miss Doyle then left the party, telling Kieran: 'I love you, goodnight.' He was found dead the next day.

Miss Doyle told the inquest she always thought she would get back together with her boyfriend of four years.

The pair 'grew up together' in Devon - Keiran was from Torquay and Miss Doyle was from nearby Newton Abbot.

They travelled the world together and after returning from 'an amazing adventure, they both went to university in Cardiff.

Keiran loved his course in 'early years teaching' but Miss Doyle struggled with the work load on her law and sociology course.

In a statement read to the court, she said: 'Keiran was not happy that I didn’t have as much time to see him and I was really, really stressed so I started to take it out on him.

'We both wanted to make it work but it was really hard, I felt like I was being pulled in too many directions because of my course work.

'I said I couldn’t give him the 110 per cent he deserved and we needed to split up so I could have the space I needed to get my life together.

'I never thought we would not get back together.'

The couple travelled to Cardiff to spend New Year’s Eve with friends at the university campus.

But the inquest heard after a few drinks the pair started to row shortly before they were due to go to a nightclub.

Keiran, who had worked as a fitter and a roofer, then tore down the pictures he had of Louise before telling her to get out of his flat.

Keiran was found by friends the next day hanging in the en-suite bathroom at his student halls.

The student, who has been described as popular and 'loving life', had no history of depression or self-harm.

Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how at the time of his death he had been drinking and was just under twice the legal drink drive limit.

Coroner Thomas Atherton recorded a narrative verdict and said it was unclear what Keiran’s intentions were.

He said: 'This has all the hallmarks of an impulsive act.

'Keiran had had an argument with Louise but he was also intoxicated and it’s very difficult to get into his mindset at that point.

'He appears to be a young man who had a real strength of character, he was not the sort of selfish person who would want to leave other people to grieve.'
