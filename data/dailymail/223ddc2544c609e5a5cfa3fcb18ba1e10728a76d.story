Pep Guardiola's Barcelona team produced the greatest football of their dominant four-year spell in world football against Chelsea – during a Champions League semi-final in which they eventually lost on aggregate.

The claim comes from one of Guardiola's closest assistants and the match in question was the epic Champions League semi final in 2012, when Chelsea drew 2-2 at the Nou Camp, despite having ten men for most of the game, winning 3-2 on aggregate and progressing to the Champions League final where they beat Bayern Munch.

A performance against Arsenal at The Emirates in 2010 is also high on the list of the finest moments of Barca's Guardiola, reckoned by many judges to be the one of the greatest teams of all-time after they won an extraordinary two Champions League trophies, two World Club Cups, three La Liga trophies and two Copas del Rey in Guardola's four years at the club.

But in a compliment to Roberto Di Matteo's Chelsea team, Guardiola and his assistant Manel Estiarte discuss the best football played by the Barca team, debating whether the 2012 semi final with Estiarte saying the Chelsea game was the team's peak.

The new book, Pep Confidential, reveals: 'Guardiola and Estiarte get involved in a debate about the best moments of Barcelona's recent golden era. For Estiarte the absolute peaks were: 'The first half against Arsenal at the Emirates [March 31, 2010. 2-2] and the first half against Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final of 2012. We never played better than those two days.'

'Guardiola disagrees. 'The performance against Chelsea was fabulous but I think we played better in the final of the World Club Cup against Santos (in 2011).That was our all-time peak.'

The Arsenal game in 2010 saw an exquisite Barca team go into a 2-0 lead before Arsene Wenger's side came back with two second half goals to create probably the greatest Champions League game seen at the stadium. Arsenal eventually lost the tie 6-3 on aggregate.

The Chelsea semi-final saw Chelsea travel to the Nou Camp with a 1-0 lead from the first leg. But Barca, playing some extraordinary football, went into a 2-0 lead, and, with John Terry sent off shortly before half time, Chelsea seemed doomed. But Ramires scored for Chelsea and Leo Messi missed a penalty for Barca before a late goal from Fernando Torres confirmed Chelsea in the final.

Manchester City also feature in Guardiola's discussions about the best his teams have played, with last year's 3-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium considered to be the peak display by Bayern Munich last season. Ironically it is Arsenal who were also responsible for the worst ten minutes of Bayern Munich's football last season.

Guardiola, who now coaches the German club and won the league and cup double last season, faced Wenger's side in the last 16 of the Champions League and eventually saw his side run at 2-0 winners at The Emirates and 3-1 on aggregate – but only after an excellent start in London by Arsenal.

In the book Guardiola is quoted as saying: 'Our worst 10 minutes this season were in the Emirates. Manuel Neuer's hand saved us that day,' he reflected. 'Our best? Probably the game against City in Manchester or the first 40 minutes of the Hertha match in Berlin.'
