For most women, having both their breasts removed and putting on 12kg would be a time in their life they would want to forget.

But not for 24-year-old Allison Snare.

After having a double mastectomy and undergoing five months of chemotherapy Ms Snare, from Launceston in Tasmania, decided it was an experience she wanted to document.

'A lot of women don't want to remember this part of their life but it is part my life and it's shaping who I am today,' Ms Snare told Daily Mail Australia.

In May last year, at 23, Ms Snare was diagnosed with the most aggressive form of breast cancer there is

The Launceston woman decided it was an period in her life that she wanted to document

Ms Snare decided to do a photo shoot in which she bared all – including her bald head and post-surgery chest – in order to show other young women that cancer can affect people of all ages.

'I put on about 12 kilos since my diagnosis, so it was a bit confronting getting topless because of that aspect,' she said.

'I was conscious of my weight but I thought it was more important to get the message out there that young women do need to get checked.

'That's why I wanted to get the photos out there, so people could see it on a young body and know they're definitely not immune.'

She always knew she was high risk because her mother had breast cancer in her early 30s and ovarian cancer in her early 40s.

'That's what took her in the end unfortunately,' Ms Snare said.

'I was always really conscious of my risks because I saw what Mum went through, and I'd check at the start of every month.

'I knew the risks the closer I got to 30 but I never imaged I'd be diagnosed at 23.'

Ms Snare checked herself in April of last year and was fine, but when she checked in May she felt a lump the size of a marble.

She got a scan and doctors confirmed that she had stage two breast cancer, and would need to have a double mastectomy.

But removing her breasts didn't worry her.

She has been deeply touched by the feedback her photos have gotten since photographer Bruce Moyle shared them on his Facebook page

'I basically told my doctor I'm fine with you taking them,' Ms Snare said.

'They were no longer my breasts, they were like ticking time bombs attached to me.'

She had discussed taking photos of her body post-surgery with photographer Bruce Moyle, but once she started chemotherapy in July she was too exhausted to go through with it.

Then, earlier this month, Mr Moyle got back in contact.

She had a breast reconstruction surgery planned for January 22 and so it was 'now or never'.

For Ms Snare said there was another important reason she wanted to have the photos – she wanted her future children to understand what she had been through – so she said yes.

'It's one part of my life I'm closing, and I wanted the photos to show my kids,' she said.

Ms Snare had 12 embryos frozen before she started chemotherapy, and hopes to start trying for children with partner Dwayne Darcy, 19, at the end of this year

'I just wanted them to see just how hard me and my partner fought for them.'

For now she is NED - no evidence of disease - but she knows there is a risk the cancer could return.

'A lot of people think as soon as you're out of treatment you're all better but that's a perception that's not correct,' she said.

'If it does come back that's usually when it has metastasised and it's gone to your brain or liver or bones or lungs or another part of your body, and once it's metastasised it's classed as stage 4 and stage 4 is incurable.

'That's what's so scary about it.'

She said her partner had stuck by her side and been totally supportive ever since her diagnosis

But Ms Snare plans to get through life the way she handled her cancer diagnosis – with confidence and a positive attitude.

She has been deeply touched by the feedback her photos have gotten since photographer Mr Moyle shared them on his Facebook page.

'Before Bruce released it I did put a status on Facebook saying a trigger warning, they are confronting images, don't look if you know you'll be affected by it,' Ms Snare said.

'Because my self-esteem is probably at its lowest with no hair, no eyelashes and eyebrows just growing back.

'I wanted to tell people to be kind because I don't think I could take any unnecessary nasty comments.

'But people have been so amazing and so positive.

'I'm glad that I did it.'
