Cutting it fine: Bryan Remley, 25, offered his services as a gardener at a home he allegedly burgled after he was caught by its gun-wielding owner

A burglar offered to cut the lawn in exchange for freedom after he was caught by a gun-wielding homeowner.

Bryan Remley, 25, allegedly broke into a couple's home in St Petersburg, Florida, last month.

But he was caught scavenging for valuables in the living room when owner Joseph Cihak, 31, got up to use the bathroom.

Mr Cihak, who had been carrying a gun to the toilet, fired two shots at Remley then held him down while his wife Colleen Traversa called 911, Fox 13 reported.

The burglar attempted to escape - lunging at Mr Cihak, the couple claim.

He then allegedly made a final plea: he would cut their grass if they let him go.

However, his offer was not enough to convince the couple who waited for police to arrive at the scene minutes later at around 5am on August 28.

Mr Remley, who was allegedly carrying a small knife, was arrested and charged with armed residential burglary and violation of probation.

The incident comes just weeks after a burglar in Minnesota was caught because he logged into Facebook during his heist - and forgot to log out.

Authorities say Nicholas Wig burgled a home in South St. Paul on June 19 and must have decided to use the computer before he fled the property. 

When the owner, James Wood, arrived home and found his place had been ransacked, he reported it to police, CBS reported.

Missing was cash, credit cards and a watch, but he found a pair of jeans, a belt and some Nike tennis shoes.

Sometime later Mr Wood noticed a Facebook page on his computer he didn't recognize.

Realizing what must have happened, he shared a picture of Wig from Wig's profile.

Mr Wood announced Wig was a thief and shared his phone number, asking for anyone with information to call him.

He did not expect to get a text from Wig himself in the evening.

'I replied (saying) ''you left a few things at my house last night, how can I get them back to you?''' Mr Wood said.

Caught: Owner Joseph Cihak claims he held Remley down with a gun until police arrived and arrested him

Wig agreed to return to the house and pick up his things.

As Mr Wood saw him approaching, he called 911.

Wig was wearing Mr Wood's watch when police arrested him.

'World’s dumbest criminal,' Mr Wood said.

Wig faces up to 10 years in prison and $20,000 in fines if convicted.

He has an extensive criminal record, including a second-degree burglary conviction, a domestic assault misdemeanor and pending drug charges.
