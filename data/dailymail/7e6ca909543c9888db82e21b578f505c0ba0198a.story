'We are thrilled with these results and really want to thank our fans for their ongoing support. Selling out faster than ever further demonstrates the tremendous appetite for more NBA basketball in the UK and throughout Europe,' said Benjamin Morel, NBA Senior Vice President, Europe, Middle East and Africa.

'With these exciting teams coming to London prepared to compete, our fans can look forward to an authentic NBA experience delivering the entertainment, excitement and all-around spectacle European fans have come to know and love.'

Speaking ahead of the release of tickets earlier in the week, New York Knicks star Amar'e Stoudemire revealed his desire to play more matches in the English capital.

Stoudemire, who scored 17 points in the Knicks' 102-87 win against the Detroit Pistons at the O2 Arena nearly two years ago said: 'I wish we could play in London every single season but again it's up to the commissioner to come up with that but I do truly enjoy playing in London for sure.'

The 31-year-old's team-mate Carmelo Anthony has echoed his sentiments revealing his excitement at returning to the venue where he won Olympic gold with the United States at the London 2012 Games.

'On behalf of my teammates and the entire Knicks organization I want to say how excited I am to be returning to London for NBA Global Games 2015,' Anthony said. 

'I have played several times in London both for the Knicks and the US Olympic team and have fond memories of the city and the great fans.'

'We are looking forward to coming to London for our first ever game in the UK,' the 22-year-old revealed. 

'The opportunity to play in front of fans in London and to explore a different city and represent the Bucks organization will be a unique experience for us all.'
