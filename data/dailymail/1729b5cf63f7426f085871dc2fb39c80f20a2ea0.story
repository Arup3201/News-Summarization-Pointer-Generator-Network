Arsenal visit Liverpool on Sunday afternoon with both sides desperate for the win to reignite their Premier League campaigns and push back towards the Champions League places.

Arsene Wenger’s side return to Anfield to the scene of last season’s humiliating 5-1 drubbing at the hands of a Raheem Sterling inspired Liverpool.

The 20 year-old has already become an integral member of Liverpool and England’s side, featuring 58 times so far for club and country in 2014 whereas Arsenal have a new talisman lighting up the league in Chile international Alexis Sanchez, but who has the edge ahead of the Anfield battle?

It’s evident both rapid forwards have become the key man in their respective sides with Sanchez adding fresh impetus to Arsenal’s attack since his £30million summer move from Barcelona.

In 15 Premier League appearances so far for the Gunners Sanchez has impressed with his dogged work rate but has also found the back of the net nine times.

Compare this to Sterling, who hasn’t scored a league goal since September, and Sanchez’s attacking efficiency becomes even more prevalent with a 32 per cent goals-to-shot ratio for the Gunners with Sterling well off on 13 per cent. 

Here's is the Premier League table before the fixtures on Sunday, with Arsenal five points clear of Liverpool

Despite an indifferent start to the season, Wenger’s side have only lost one of their last six matches in all competitions and this coincides with Sanchez’s recent flourishing form.

The 26-year-old has scored seven and assisted four of Arsenal's last 17 league goals at 65 per cent involvement, which underlines his importance as the spearhead of the Gunners attack.

Sterling scored twice in the 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal in this fixture last season and with the departure of Luis Suarez, persistent injuries for Daniel Sturridge and lack of form from summer purchases, the 20-year-old has become the focal point of Brendan Rodgers’ front line.

The youngster has recently been deployed by Rodgers down the middle and scored a brace in the midweek Capital One Cup win over Bournemouth, ending a 17 game goal drought for Liverpool.

He obviously needs to get back amongst the goals but his impact on the team is undeniable. His pass completion is at eighty per cent and at seventy five in the final third. He’s linking up well with his team-mates and acting as the linchpin going forward.

Sanchez has become renowned for his endeavour and work rate, which Wenger has praised for motivating his team-mates into similar action.

However Sterling has also adapted his game to lead the line, winning 86 per cent of tackles and a statistic well ahead of Sanchez’s 72 per cent rate.

Providing pace, an outlet and goals mixed with a brutal work rate, you can see similarities between Sanchez and Sterling.

They can adapt in a central or wide role and clearly drive their side on, with both creating 40 chances for their team in the league this season including four assists for Sterling and five for Sanchez.

As both Liverpool and Arsenal have had their defensive frailties exposed this season, the pace from Sterling and Sanchez is a true asset. Their ability to start fresh counter attacks with one in two success rate in dribble completion highlights both their attacking potency.

There is a down side to their impact with the pair in danger of burnout as we approach the turn of the year but if they continue to lead their team with such aplomb then it’s hard to see either manager resting their star man too much other the busy festive fixture list.

A win at Anfield on Sunday afternoon will gain more plaudits but which talisman will prevail is difficult to predict. All that is certain is Sanchez and Sterling can provide a fascinating head-to-head in the crucial clash.
