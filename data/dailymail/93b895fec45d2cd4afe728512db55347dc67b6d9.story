A Utah man has allegedly shot dead his girlfriend and then tried, and failed, to commit suicide just hours after telling her family he was planning to propose to her on Valentine's Day. 

Christian Emerson, 26, is a convicted rapist but had been dating Amanda Hoyt, also 26, for about a year. 

Police believe he pulled out a gun while the two were driving home from a family birthday party on Sunday night and shot Hoyt several times. He then shot himself in the head.

Amanda Hoyt was shot multiple times and killed by her boyfriend Christian Emerson while the two were driving home from a birthday party

Emerson posted this photo around Halloween time of him wearing a Michael Myers mask from the 'Halloween' slasher movies. He joked on his Facebook page that he's a serial killer

Authorities were called to the Salt Lake City suburb of North Logan, Utah, about midnight after Emerson's Subaru crashed into a curb. Inside, they found Hoyt dead and Emerson with a gunshot wound to the head, the Deseret News reports. 

Emerson was flown to the hospital and is expected to survive his injury.  

Hoyt's stepfather says Emerson had pulled him aside just hours before and said he wanted to propose to her on Valentine's Day.

'We talked for a little while, and then I knew that they were thinking about getting married around Christmas of this year,' Jeff Tingey told the newspaper. 

Mr Tingey said no one in the family ever had any indication that Emerson was violent. 

Hoyt had been dating Emerson for about a year and he recently told her family he planned to propose on Valentine's Day

'I feel pretty confident in my abilities to discern if there was something that didn't feel right, and I never saw this one coming. All I saw was somebody who deeply loved Amanda,' he said. 

Mr Tingey said Emerson was open about his 2007 rape conviction. Emerson is on the sexual assault registry in Utah for the crime, which was committed in Oregon. 

Emerson's Facebook profile picture shows him and Hoyt smiling together and both of them have several happy photos posted to their social media accounts. 

Emerson also posted a photo of himself wearing a creepy Michael Myers mask from the 'Halloween' slasher films. When a friend commented: 'Dude that makes you look like a serial killer just thought I'd let you know that,' he responded: 'I am lol.'

Hoyt, who had suffered diabetes since she was a girl, recently underwent surgery and was on the mend. 

Mr Tigey said she was 'turning her life around' and planned to attend school to become a nursing assistant.
