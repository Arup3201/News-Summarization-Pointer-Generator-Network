An aspiring actress who used the internet to track down a man suspecting of shooting her father dead 26 years ago has come face to face with him in court.

Joselyn Martinez, 36, conducted an online manhunt to find Justo Santos, 43, who was suspected of killing José 'George' Martinez in 1986.

Santos was arrested in Miami last week and appeared in court on Monday to face a charge of murder.

Miss Martinez watched from the public gallery as he pleaded not guilty. She said after the court appearance in New York she felt 'satisfaction.'

Joselyn Martinez, 36,  was just nine when her father was killed in front of her mother in Manhattan

'Knowing the person my father was, I couldn’t live with myself if (Santos) stayed free,' Miss Martinez said before the court appearance.

Ms Martinez from New York was just nine when her father was killed in front of his wife in Inwood, Manhattan, according to the New York Post.

Santos, then 16, and two of his companions were thrown out of Mr Martinez’s restaurant, Dominican Express, after they allegedly started harassing his wife and making sexual comments.

On the sidewalk witnesses reportedly told police that Santos pulled a pistol and shot the restaurateur.

Joselyn Martinez kept police wanted posters to make sure she would not forget the name of the suspect

He slumped down on the ground and, bleeding heavily, was taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Columbia in a cab, but he died.

Miss Martinez kept the wanted posters to make sure she would not forget the name of the suspect.

She said: 'My mom told me to never forget his name. She’d tell me, "You have to know who did this to your family".'

Miss Martinez started to use social media. She kept an eye out for the man she had been looking for, although his name did not show up on Facebook or MySpace.

Then in 2008, she signed up for a free promotional search on Background.com and Santos' name appeared.

Santos was a suspect in the shooting but he relocated to the Dominican Republic and police could not find him

But Santos relocated to the Dominican Republic and US police could not track him down.

Spurred on by the results, Joselyn paid $70 fees to Background.com and similar sites, including USA-Peopleseach.com, Peoplelookup.com and Intelius.com.

She added: 'They all had it. They had his address. They had his phone number. He must have thought it was all over, that he had gotten away with it.'

She handed the details over to the NYPD in a desperate attempt to help them solve the cold case. Detectives called her on Friday to let her know he had been arrested by Miami police.
