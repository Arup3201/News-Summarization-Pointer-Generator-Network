Cycling to work may be more popular than ever, but a new contender is overtaking the competition - literally.

A video filmed last week on London's Cycle Superhighway shows a suited commuter rolling to work on a battery-powered skateboard, controlled by a hand-held remote control.

He manages to overtake a host of cyclists on his eight-mile journey from Merton, South West London, into the City.

Rather than hitting the showers on arrival and peeling off sweat-encrusted lycra, the man can walk right up to a restaurant and head inside.

The clip, featuring Nick Druce, founder of manufacturers Skate Electric, was filmed last Wednesday and shows his latest invention.

According to its founder the vehicle does not yet have an official classification for road use, but will be given one soon.
