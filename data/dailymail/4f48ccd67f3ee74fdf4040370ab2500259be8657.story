Nigel Farage has defended a Ukip official who said it was the party of 'bigots' as he was left reeling from the defection of a top MEP to the Conservatives.

The Ukip leader hit out at the party's former communities spokesman Amjad Bashir after his defection to join David Cameron's party.

But he refused to condemn Ukip party secretary Matthew Richardson saying that Ukip should represent 'bigots' and labelling the NHS a 'waste of money'.

Ukip has been stunned by the Mr Bashir's shock decision to change parties, claiming only the Tories can deliver a vote on Britain's membership of the European Union.

In a stinging parting short, Mr Bashir said he decided to leave Ukip because it 'has become a vanity project for Nigel Farage and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true'.

In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he said he had 'experienced racism in Ukip' and accused Mr Farage of e runs running the party 'like a dictator, employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way'.

In an attempt to play down the defection, Mr Farage said Ukip had become 'increasingly alarmed' about allegations of impropriety against Mr Bashir.

He claimed the MEP 'didn't tell us the truth' about the alleged employment of illegal immigrants in his restaurant business and there are 'some big open questions in Brussels about money'.

There were also claims of interference in candidate selection in Keighley, West Yorkshire and links with 'political extremists' from Pakistan.

Mr Bashir has strongly denied the accusations made by Ukip since his decision to quit.

In a fresh blow to Ukip, it emerged Mr Richardson had made a series of damaging public remarks.

The party secretary – who, ironically, was hired to stamp out negative media stories about Ukip – said: 'People talk about Ukip being bigots but there are hundreds of thousands of bigots in the United Kingdom and they deserve representation.'

Mr Farage refused to condemn the extraordinary comments, which Mr Richardson has suggested was pub 'banter.

Mr Farage told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'There were people in a pub having a drink. If you expect me to ban all Ukip officials from going into pubs, from laughing and smirking and joking, it's not going to happen.'

Meanwhile, footage emerged from 2010 of Mr Richardson attacking the health service at events in the US.

Speaking at the Young Americans Foundation conference in Washington he said: 'When I was younger a trillion was an astronomic number. Now when I look at our national deficits, and your national deficits, actually it is an economic number.

'A number I couldn't possible imagine when I was younger is now the amount of money that is owed by my country, and soon more than that by your country, to other countries, paying for wasteful socialist programmes. And of course at the heart of this, the Reichstag bunker of socialism is the National Health Service.'

At the Conservative Political Action Conference in the same year he said: 'This socialist government wastes money like you can't imagine. They have started doing every wasteful scheme under the sun ... The biggest waste of money of course in the United Kingdom is the NHS, the National Health Service.'

Mr Farage, who has advocated an insurance-funded model for the NHS in the past, insisted Ukip was committed to a health service that was free at the point of delivery.

But he said the service was struggling because of the 'massive increase' in the country's population.

He called for measures to crack down on health tourism and said people studying for medical subjects should be exempt from tuition fees to reduce the NHS's reliance on migrant workers.

He said: 'We want the NHS to be better run, we want it to be more efficient. We think it's ludicrous that middle management has grown by 48%, we think the fact that health tourism is costing GBP2 billion a year is wrong and the fact that one in five new nurses being taken on have to come from abroad says to us 'let's make sure there are no tuition fees for people who are taking medical degrees'.

'We want a National Health Service that is free at the point of delivery and funded through taxation.

'But the one thing nobody dares say is the reason we have an NHS crisis right now is because of a massive increase in the population in this country.'

Amjad Bashir: 'I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Farage'

I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Nigel Farage and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true. David Cameron famously said that Ukip was a party of ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’.

Certainly, I have experienced racism in Ukip. I have been racially abused on social media by other Ukip members who ask offensive questions like: ‘Are you a Muslim?’

I was angry when I was the only Ukip politician who was cut out of a video of speeches at a party event. I complained that it was because of my ethnic minority background, but was fobbed off.

Some of the antics of Ukip MEPs are appalling. They make childish remarks during debates and are abusive towards MEPs from other countries when there is no call for it.

I was outraged when I heard Mr Farage talk of a ‘fifth column’ of immigrants in Britain. I have worked hard all my life, and when my father came to this country he worked his socks off to provide for his family. It is an insult for him to talk in this way.

I joined Ukip because I wanted a referendum on the EU and wanted better controls on immigration. But now I have no doubt that Mr Cameron will deliver on this, so, in my view, Ukip has outlived its usefulness.

Mr Farage wants to use Ukip as a means for getting power for himself, and that is not what the party was set up to achieve.

He has created a popularist image for himself as the jolly chap at the bar with a pint in his hand, but the reality is different.

He runs the party like a dictator, employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way.

Ukip is guided more by dogma than common sense.

Since I became an MEP, I have been amazed that Ukip often votes against Britain’s national interest in the European Parliament. For example, we were told to vote against EU money for flood relief schemes in the UK because the money had come from Brussels. I protested that this was ridiculous because much of the EU money was British in the first place, but I was ignored.

And Ukip’s reaction on finding out that I was going to join the Conservatives sums up what is wrong with them. They made a crude attempt to smear me with false allegations of irregularities in the recruitment of Asian members in Bradford.

There is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that I made the right decision.

There is no escaping one simple fact: when Mr Cameron said: ‘If you go to bed with Nigel Farage on Election night, you will wake with Ed Miliband the next day,’ he was telling the truth.
