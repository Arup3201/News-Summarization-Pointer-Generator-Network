Gabby Logan, 41, prepared for England's opening World Cup match with yoga and a blow dry

As the hapless men around her face a torrent of abuse, Gabby Logan has emerged as the BBC’s star World Cup performer.

And yesterday the sports presenter revealed the key to her cool head – two hours of yoga and a match day wash and blow dry.

While juggling punditry, pitch-side interviews and epic journeys across Brazil to follow the games, married mother of two Mrs Logan has been updating her fans on her personal website.

Yesterday, the 41-year-old described how she prepared for England’s opening game against Italy on Saturday night with yoga and some time to herself.

‘I’ll come clean, you should know that as well as coffee I am a little addicted to yoga,’ she wrote. ‘I think it’s changed me in the last seven months.

‘On match day I was aiming to sleep as late as possible knowing we’d have a late night and I made it to 8.15am.

‘So I indulged myself in around two hours of yoga. At home, it’s not easy doing it with kids around so I tend to do it before they get up, which is a beautiful hour of the day.’

Mrs Logan, who is married with twins, said yoga had transformed her life and her relationships with her family.

She described how her son will try to distract her as she does headstands but has now learned to leave her in peace.

‘I don’t feel like snapping at my lovely husband as much, which has got to be a good thing,’ she wrote.

‘A few weeks ago I was practising yoga when my eight-year-old son came in to the room to ask me something. At this point I was holding a head-stand for 30 breaths. He was lying on the floor with his nose almost touching mine, trying to distract me, asking if he could go for a play date, but the Yoga was more powerful.

‘So I ignored him and as I was in a head stand he seemed to accept that. If anyone has been nagged by an eight-year-old boy you will understand it’s almost worth learning to do a head stand if they give up on their demands that easily.’

The presenter and former gymnast explained how she also treated herself to some proper grooming time before the game on Saturday – although the oppressive conditions in Brazil somewhat ruined the effect.

‘After the match day yoga on Saturday I washed and blow dried my hair all the while knowing that the second I stepped out of my hotel room in Manaus it would take on a new life of its own in the heat (think Diana Ross circa 1975),’ she wrote.

‘Then I applied my make-up which wouldn’t actually be seen on screen until seven hours later by which point it would probably have slid off into the ether. Or wherever it is make-up which disappears off your face actually goes. The whole grooming process felt a bit futile in Manaus.’

Mrs Logan described how she felt ‘bedraggled’ and ‘grotty’ after England’s defeat to Italy on Saturday night.

The following morning, she had to be up at 4am for a flight to Rio, but said having children was good training for working when exhausted.

‘I can survive a night without sleep (I have twins),’ she added.

Mrs Logan has been widely praised for her coverage in Brazil.

She has previously accused rival broadcaster Sky of using female sports presenters in figure-hugging outfits as ‘window dressing’.

As Phil Neville and foreign pundits have faced criticism for being boring and incomprehensible, she has been lauded for her intelligent and considered observations and insights.

Mrs Logan, who lives in Buckinghamshire with husband Kenny and their twin children, said she kept down to earth by remembering what a ‘privileged’ position she is in.

‘So there I was waiting in the tunnel for the England team bus to arrive, it was only 20 minutes later than we had been told but long enough for me to think what a crazy and privileged job I have,’ she wrote.

‘I get to see really incredible people and the things they do from a different angle. None of us permanently show the world exactly who we are, there is a tendency to demand that all talented sports people should be ebullient, loquacious and full of wisdom.

‘Some will be but others will just be very talented sports people, shy people, people who have no desire to be in the limelight except for the sporting success they achieve.

‘Witnessing the moments when they are “off” is as fascinating as seeing them “on”, remembering that they are people, not Gods, and most of them realise that too.

They are people not Gods and they too have feet of clay. Uniquely this weekend we all seemed to agree that they tried their very best and that is all you can ask of anyone.’
