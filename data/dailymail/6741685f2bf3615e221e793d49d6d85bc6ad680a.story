Authorities in New Jersey have collected more than 2,600 weapons in exchange for cash during a two-day gun buyback event over the weekend - including a rocket launcher.

The Trenton gun buyback far surpassed one about 35 miles away in Camden last month that netted more than 1,100 weapons.

In photos from the program taken at an evidence warehouse, an anti-tank rocket launcher stood out among various handguns, rifles and sawed off shotguns.

New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said during a news conference on Tuesday that nearly 95 per cent of all the weapons purchased were fully operational.

Mr Chiesa told Fox 5: 'I'm not here today suggesting buybacks are the singular answer.'

'However, there's no question that buybacks are part of the solution, and we believe that they're making a difference in New Jersey as evidenced by the 700 illegal firearms collected in this buyback.'

He said that about $324,000 was given out in the guns-for-cash program - and nearly $100,000 of that total was in vouchers because organizers ran out of money.

Another interesting firearm seized at the buyback event was a police baton that had been converted into a shotgun, The Times of Trenton reported.

Det Brian Kielty told the paper: 'I’ve never seen anything like it before. That’s a conversation piece.'

Mercer County residents received $25 to $250 for each firearm depending on type, condition and legality.

About 700 of the weapons collected were illegal, MyFoxNY.com reported.

About $100,000 was budgeted but because of the huge turnout, the amount spent is expected to be well over double that.

Some participants were given vouchers after money ran out Saturday.

In a similar event in Seattle over the weekend, a missile launcher turned up at a gun buyback event, where authorities were looking to determine whether it was legal or possibly stolen from the military.

A man standing outside the event on Saturday, identified by Reuters as Mason Vranish, bought the military weapon for $100 from another person waiting in line, according to Detective Mark Jamieson.

The single-use device is a launch tube assembly for a Stinger portable surface-to-air missile and already had been used.
