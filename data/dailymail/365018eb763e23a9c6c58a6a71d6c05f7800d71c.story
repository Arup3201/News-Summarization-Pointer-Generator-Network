This mischievous monkey  was clearly ready for his close up as he happily struck a pose for the camera.

The  crested black macaque caught an unsuspecting photographer unawares by flashing his gleaming white gnashers. 

But while this inquisitive primate was happy to say cheese others in the enclosure at Chester Zoo paid no attention to the lens.

Say cheese! This cheeky monkey was clearly not camera shy when photographer Bob Hadfield pulled out his camera

It was believed that the animal may have been fascinated by his reflection in the camera lens.

The images were captured by photographer Bob Hadfield during a visit to the zoo 

Black macaques, also called yaki or black apes, have a hairless face and are known for their intelligence and dexterity.

They are found on only two islands in Indonesia and are threatened with extinction due to hunting and a lose of their habitat. 

The species previously made headline around the world after a female managed to take a selfie using the camera of award winning photographer David Slate in a national park in North Sulawesi, Indonesia.
