Ed Miliband has been accused of 'hypocrisy' for ignoring Labour's Welsh NHS crisis while trying to reap electoral profit from England's Health Service problems.

More than 100 patients have signed an open letter to the Labour leader claiming he has 'turned a blind eye' to more serious failings in Wales.

They also demanded a full inquiry into the Welsh NHS's troubles – a call echoed by one of Britain's most respected surgeons.

Ed Miliband has been criticised for ignoring Labour's Welsh NHS crisis while trying to gain electoral profit from England's Health Service problems

Former Royal College of Surgeons president Professor Sir Norman Williams said there were enough worrying 'smoke signals' to justify holding an independent inquiry into potential problems in the Welsh NHS.

He pointed to previous concerns raised by Labour MP Ann Clwyd, the British Medical Association, NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh and the Royal College of Surgeons.

Sir Norman suggested the review should be like the one carried out by Sir Bruce in 2013 into English hospitals with high mortality rates.

He said: 'I feel there may be issues in Wales that are similar to issues found in England some time ago. Rather than sweep it under the carpet or deny it, the sensible thing would be to consider investigating it properly.

'When we had similar problems in England, Sir Bruce Keogh was asked to look at those hospitals where there appeared to be a higher mortality rate.

'It seems to me that that is the responsible way to handle it. The problem is that it's a political football at the moment.'

Mr Miliband has repeatedly vehemently criticised the Tories' handling of the Health Service in England in recent months. But he has refused to deny claims that he said he wanted to 'weaponise' the NHS to help win the General Election in May.

Now 131 patients in Wales have backed a letter organised by the Welsh Conservatives that condemns the 'scandalous postcode lottery' in waiting times, ambulance delays and A&E standards.

They tell Mr Miliband in the letter: 'You regularly claim that the English NHS is in a state of 'crisis'. However, you have consistently refused to comment on the situation in Wales, where you lead the party that runs the health service.

'As the leader of the Labour Party, we are asking you to take responsibility for this state of affairs, to back a public inquiry into the condition of the Welsh NHS, and to commit to work with Welsh Ministers to increase the budget and restore equality of care standards across the UK.

'It is simply hypocrisy to call it a crisis in England and then turn a blind eye to the more serious situation in Wales.'

A new poll shows the NHS will be the top issue for voters at the election, and Mr Miliband has sought to capitalise on the problems in England's Health Service.

The Labour leader tweeted this month: 'The Tories' NHS crisis means more patients than ever on record are waiting over 4 hours in A&E. Only Labour will protect our NHS.'

But new statistics show that only 81 per cent of patients visiting Welsh emergency units in December were treated within four hours, the lowest rate since records began in 2009.

Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said it was a disgrace for Mr Miliband to speak of a crisis in England when he refused to call Labour to order in Wales

In England 90.2 per cent of people were seen within this time limit against a target of 95 per cent, although the numbers are not directly comparable because of differences in how they are recorded.

Last month, 2,420 patients at major A&E units in Wales had to wait more than 12 hours before being treated, and over the past year there were 15,895 such waits.

Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said it was a disgrace for Mr Miliband to speak of a crisis in England when he refused to call Labour to order in Wales. 

'Ed Miliband is making a grave mistake in seeking to 'weaponise' the NHS as an election issue, and Welsh patients in particular will be furious at his double standards,' he added.

'Every time he speaks about health, people are reminded of the devastation that the Labour Party has unleashed on the Welsh NHS after years of savage budget cuts.'

A Labour spokesman said: 'David Cameron attacks Wales to run away from his own record in England, where A&Es are in crisis and patients are waiting longer for operations and cancer treatment.

'The independent Nuffield Trust found that no one part of the UK has a health service that is consistently ahead or behind. The Welsh NHS improved dramatically in the past 15 years. When the Tories were last in charge in Wales, patients waited two years for operations – that's why people don't trust them with the NHS.'

Tina Donnelly, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, yesterday criticised the rival parties for using the Health Service as a 'political football'. She told BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme that Wales needs more than 2,500 extra nurses, including 1,000 in acute care to tackle the A&E crisis.
