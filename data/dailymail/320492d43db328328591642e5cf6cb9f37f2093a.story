They have transformed their dull street into a glorious green garden and been lauded by the council several times.

But the community-spirited residents of Rockcliffe Avenue in Whitley Bay have now been told by the same authority they must ditch the whole thing - because it is a 'health and safety hazard'.

Their efforts transforming the dull suburban alleyway have helped cut anti-social behaviour in the area, revitalised the street and got neighbours working together.

Uplifting: One resident said that the pathway had even helped the area overcome its anti-social behaviour problems

Defiant: Michael Kelley, who led the transformation, says he is 'absolutely livid'

Haven: Locals from all around Whitley Bay come to enjoy the flowers on Rockcliffe Avenue

Since residents began transforming the
path six years ago, they have been awarded a number of community prizes
by North Tyneside council.

In the prestigious North Tyneside in 
Bloom contest in 2010 they were honoured for ‘best street effort’ and 
just last year they won ‘best community effort’.

In a sudden reversal, however, the 
council which awarded those prizes has now insisted the plant pots are 
dangerous and may obstruct people walking down the alley.

Those who have worked for years to 
maintain the beautiful ‘secret garden’ say it is ridiculous that it is 
being targeted by ‘jobsworth’ council chiefs.

‘This area has become a wildlife 
corridor and attracts butterflies, hedgehogs, bees and bats. Children 
from the nearby nursery come here for nature walks,’ said Mike Kelley, 
55, who led the transformation.

‘Now the same council that gave us the awards wants us to remove the planters. I am absolutely livid.’ 

Haven: Residents say the uplifting pathway has improved the whole area

Hard work: The residents of Rockcliffe Avenue have made a huge effort to make the street look well-cared for and attractive, spending thousands on their gardening

Well-maintained: Thousands of pounds have been spent on maintaining the flowers, which will be removed unless residents change the containers

They say if residents want to save the
displays they must ‘apply for grant funding’ to find more suitable 
plant pots which comply with highways legislation.

Mr Kelly, who has spent about £8,000 on the street displays, said locals are deeply upset and angry.

‘This community has put in a lot of effort to make the street look nice,’ he added.

‘I have been putting out various 
planters and have spent a lot of money doing it. Other residents have 
added to that and also look after their gardens well. All this has 
helped us to win awards.’

Retired home carer Jenny Craig, said: 
‘This pathway has given so much pleasure to so many people. It has 
improved the area, which used to suffer from anti-social behaviour some 
years ago. It’s like a little haven.’

Fun for children: Laura Guthzeit, manager of Rainbow Childcare Nursery, centre, going for a walk with Mathew, left, and Macy-May Stretton, right

In jeopardy: Residents have been told to apply for a grant for new plant pots if they want to hang on to their flowers

Obstruction: Gardening organiser Michael Kelley pointed out that even if they do get new plant pots that will not over come the supposed access problems

Mother-of-two Laura Turville, 32, of 
nearby Edwards Road, Whitley Bay, added: ‘I bring my two children here 
all the time and they love it. We call it the secret garden. I think 
every street should be like this,’ while local nursery manager Laura 
Guthzeit, 29, said: ‘We bring the children here and they love it.

‘They point out all the little 
features and flowers. It’s a safe place to walk down here.’ Despite the 
upset in the community, North Tyneside Council maintained residents will
have to apply for grant funding for new planters which meet ‘required 
standards’ and do not obstruct those with ‘accessibility needs’.

A spokesman added: ‘North Tyneside 
Council appreciates the efforts of residents of Rockcliffe Avenue over 
the years. However, the number of planters has increased to an extent 
where they obstruct the pavement.

‘Not all residents agree to the scale of this community effort and have concerns about impact on the pathways.

‘Under highways legislation we have an obligation to protect the rights of the public at large.’
