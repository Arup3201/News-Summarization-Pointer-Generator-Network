A mother whose face had to be rebuilt after she was battered by her jealous 26 stone ex-boyfriend has insisted he is not a monster.

Helen Callaghan - who is just 4ft 10in and weighs 6 stone - was beaten and throttled by Thomas Day after he found text messages on her phone from another man.

Her face was fractured in 20 places - including her cheeks, nose and eye sockets - and surgeons were forced to rely on old photographs to reconstruct it.

However, speaking for the first time since the brutal attack, Miss Callaghan, 28, has said her former partner didn't mean 'to 
hurt me in the way he did'.

'I was told a pathologist's report found that one more blow possibly would have killed me,' said Miss Callaghan, who has been forced to have metal plates implanted into her jaw and cheeks.

'I was also told the type of injuries they found on me would normally be found on someone who was dead.

'But I don't think he meant to 
hurt me in the way he did. I don't think he meant to kill me or break or
the bones that he broke.

Jailed: Day, who is 26 stone and almost 6ft tall, has been jailed for nine years and four months

'I didn't think he was capable of doing what he did. He's not a monster.'

Day, who is almost 6ft tall, was initially arrested by police on suspicion of attempted murder - to which he said: 'If I wanted her dead, I would have killed her.'

He
was later jailed for nine years and four months for causing grievous 
bodily harm and common assault at Manchester Crown Court.

Miss Callaghan, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, has revealed how 39-year-old 
Day was about 16 stone when they met.

He became more controlling 
and jealous as he gradually gained weight throughout the course of their
relationship, she said.

'He was unhappy because of his weight, it made him so depressed,' she said.

'I didn't care what weight he was, it didn't make any difference to me, but it was a big problem for him.

'He was terrified that I would leave him, and he wanted to know where I was and who I was with because of his insecurities.

'He thought I was seeing somebody else but I wasn't. The text messages he saw didn't mean anything.'

Miss Callaghan said she had been lying in
bed at home when Day had started to batter her tiny frame - causing her to pass out in a pool of her own blood.

'He's not a monster': Despite the brutal attack, the 28-year-old has claimed her ex-boyfriend 'didn't mean' to hurt her so badly. 'I don't think he meant to kill me or break or the bones that he broke,' she said

'There was blood everywhere - it was all over the place,' she said. 'My eye was swollen and closed up. My face didn't look symmetrical anymore. I looked like I'd been in a boxing ring.'

The couple's two children Thomas, 10, and Lillie, 
seven, walked into the bedroom moments after the attack to find their father standing over their bloodied mother.

They ran hysterically from the house and into the arms of concerned
neighbours.

The court heard that two weeks before the brutal beating, 
Day, from Fallowfield, had attacked Miss Callaghan for the first time in their 12-year 
relationship after a row on June 16 - Father's Day - scratching her face with a knife.

A week later, on June 23, he went on a
rampage in the Withington bar where Miss Callaghan worked - smashing 
pool cues and threatening to kill one of her colleagues.

The final and most vicious attack came on June 30 after Day went through her phone while she was asleep.

Fallowfield pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm,
common assault and affray.

He also admitted affray and importing £1,000 worth of cannabis into the UK
from India.

Sentencing Day to nine years and four months in prison, Judge Michael Henshell told him: 'Jealousy is the most potent and dangerous of emotions and it causes untold harm.

Meaningful: Since the attack, Miss Callaghan has had a tattoo printed on her back below a previous inking of Day's name. It reads: 'What doesn't kill you, Makes you stronger'

'The injuries were extensive and 
almost fatal. They are the most appalling of injuries.

'This was an 
incredibly vicious and forceful attack on a woman, by you, in the home 
where she was living, while two children were in the house.'

Speaking after the court case, the couple's son Thomas said he had started to forgive his father.

'At the start I was really angry with my dad because of what he did to my mum and her face,' he said. 'But now I've spoken to him and seen him in prison, I'm not as angry.

'I wish he hadn't done what he did because a lot of people hate him now, but that's the first thing he has ever done wrong. I really miss him. I will forgive him and I love him very much.'

Since the attack, Miss Callaghan has had a tattoo printed on her back, below a previous inking of Day's name, reading, 'What doesn't kill you, Makes you stronger'.
