Botched: Labour have criticsed the appointment of Lord Hill of Oareford as Britain's next EU commissoner

David Cameron’s bid to secure a top job for Britain in the EU Commission was branded a ‘shambles’ last night after his controversial candidate was forced to sell his shares in a major lobbying company.

Downing Street said Lord Hill of Oareford would sell what is thought to be a major shareholding in the lobbying giant Huntsworth amid warnings in Brussels that it would make his candidacy unacceptable.

Labour said the move underlined the botched nature of Lord Hill’s appointment. Shadow Europe Minister Gareth Thomas said: ‘David Cameron’s approach to Europe goes from bad to worse. After his complete failure to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming Commission President this shambles will not help in rebuilding our influence to secure crucial reforms.’

He said Lord Hill should now face confirmation hearings at Westminster as well as in the European Parliament.

Lord Hill, who was Mr Cameron’s surprise choice to be Britain’s next EU commissioner, has spent his entire career in the revolving door between lobbying and politics.

He and his PR companies have spun for a string of foreign regimes, banks and big businesses, many of them with direct interests in Brussels. Big name clients included the United Arab Emirates, Tesco and shamed welfare-to-work firm A4e.

Phillipe Lamberts, the leader of the Green group of MEPs, raised concerns about Lord Hill’s past as a lobbyist and his links to Huntsworth, which is owned by Mr Cameron’s Oxfordshire neighbour and constituency chairman Lord Chadlington.

He said allowing Lord Hill’s appointment would be like ‘letting the wolves into the sheep fold’ – and suggested that the European Parliament could use its powers to block him.

Several senior Brussels figures were also said to have raised concerns with Europe Minister David Lidington in the 24 hours since Lord Hill’s nomination for the £210,000-a-year job was announced.

Downing Street insisted there was no conflict of interest, but said Lord Hill wanted to make sure his confirmation hearings at the European Parliament were ‘as smooth as possible’ with ‘no perceived conflict of interest’.

Mr Lamberts said: ‘There is no shame in having worked for the private sector. The question is conflicts of interest. If it comes to a hearing, someone with a past in lobbying can expect to be grilled with double the energy. We want to reduce the influence of lobbying and we don’t want to let the wolves into the sheep fold.’

The President of the European Parliament warned that Lord Hill could also be blocked because of his Eurosceptic views.

In an extraordinary snub, German socialist Martin Schulz, who is a key ally of Mr Juncker, said he could not rule out Lord Hill being rejected. ‘I can’t imagine that Hill, with his radical anti-European views, which he is supposed to have, will get a majority in the European Parliament,’ he said.

While the parliament cannot vote against individual Commissioners it can reject their suitability as a whole, leading to nominees perceived as weak being rejected. 

Shambles: Shadow Europe Minister Gareth Thomas (left) said David Cameron’s approach to Europe has gone 'from bad to worse' follwing his failure to  stop Jean-Claude Juncker (right) becoming Commission President

This morning Mr Cameron will hold his first face-to-face talks with Mr Juncker since his failed bid to stop the federalist former prime minister of Luxembourg becoming president of the European Commission.

The Prime Minister will seek a top economic job for Lord Hill – either trade, competition or responsibility for the EU’s single market – despite the controversy surrounding his candidacy.

But experts warned that his decision to send a low-profile candidate – partly because of a reluctance to spark a by-election – could count against Britain, when other countries are nominating much more senior ministers. Mats Persson, director of the think tank Open Europe, described it as a gamble.

Lord Hill was backed by newly-appointed Defence Minister Michael Fallon, who said he was ‘one of the most effective political operators we’ve got’. Mr Fallon acknowledged that the reshuffle had given the Cabinet a more Eurosceptic edge, but said this was in tune with public opinion.
