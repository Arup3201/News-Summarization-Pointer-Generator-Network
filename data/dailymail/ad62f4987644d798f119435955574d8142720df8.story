On Sunday night they caused havoc after they allegedly attacked staff and disturbed fellow guests at the Corinthia Hotel London.

Now, Rylan Clark and Lucy Spraggan are paying the price for their shameful behaviour as they have been ejected from their luxury accommodation.

The two X Factor contestants looked sheepish as they were escorted from their posh hotel on Tuesday night following their boozy and lewd antics.

Lucy was keen to play down the 
disciplinary action, which was taken by the hotel and not X Factor 
producers, as she and Rylan were taken away with their luggage.

The
20-year-old female, who last night attended the Attitude magazine 
awards, tweeted: 'Me and @RylanClark are partaking in a small vacation 
from the hotel for a few days. Our most sincere apologies for our 
#beerfear behaviour.'

An X 
Factor source told MailOnline: 'It was basically the final straw. They 
have been kicked out because of their bad behaviour the other night.

'So they have been moved out of the Corinthia and will be staying at the Hilton hotel near where the show is filmed in Wembley.'

However, the Hilton London Wembley is
hardly a downgrade from the Corinthia, as the brand-new hotel, situated
directly opposite the stadium, included a rooftop bar and a roof 
terrace with views over the arena.

Lucy and Rylan's exit from the Corinthia was made even more embarrassing when they were told they could not use the main entrance.

Instead they were ushered out of the loading bay area at the back of the hotel, where they had to wait for a cab to pick them up.

Rylan and Lucy were seen walking past laundry and rubbish bins as they waited for their cab to get them.

Managers at the Corinthia, where rooms cost up to Â£2,650 per night, were furious after Rylan and Lucy went on a boozy bender following Sunday night's result show.

The trouble began after Rylan and Lucy spent the evening partying at G-A-Y nightclub with Tulisa's PA Gareth Varey until 4am.

The group had been drinking heavily and could barely stand up as they left. When they arrived back at the hotel Lucy had to carry Rylan up the stairs.

Not finished with the night's antics he came back down and pulled his pants down in the street whilst making a lot of noise.

Rylan then went into the hotel and the receptionists told him they wanted him out.

Onlookers alleged he then picked up a wet floor sign and threw it at the reception staff before running back out of the hotel still clutching onto Lucy.

The drama didn't stop there as the pair then ran up to Trafalgar Square and tried to get on a bus.

The X Factor PA's were hauled out of bed by angry hotel staff who then pursued the pair around the West End.

An onlooker said that Rylan and Lucy 
were down an alleyway where they both urinated in public before the X 
Factor staff finally caught up with them.

They
were told that they were being evicted from the hotel. The staff 
managed to talk them both into going back into the hotel to avoid any 
more damage but Rylan didn't go easily and clashed with one of the women
who he shouted and swore at.
