A computer boffin has built a makeshift 3D body scanner out of everyday gadgets and used it to create a replica of his father. 

Dat Phan from Mission District, San Franciso, used a gaming computer, wheel bearing, plywood and an Xbox Kinect to make the prints which were then turned into a small model.

He was inspired to start experimenting with the process through his membership of CODAME, a non-profit art and technology organisation.  

Genius: Dat Phan from Mission District, San Franciso, used a gaming computer, wheel bearing, plywood and an Xbox Kinect to make a 3D printer. His father spins on a rotating wooden disk (pictured)

End result: He then used the technology to create a replica model of his father 

As an undergraduate he studied computers but it wasn't until he started using them for art that he started to get creative.

To complete the process, which only takes around a minute, he uses the Kinect as a scanner and places the subject on a rotating platform made of the plywood. 

It turns using a motor and a wheel bearing he bought off Ebay.

The Xbox console is fixed to a sliding podium, made out of a speaker stand, piping and some cords. 

As the subject spins while holding a pose, data is collected and then fed back through the gaming computer which recreates a 3D image. 

Dat told Mission Local: 'I started doing research and thinking about how to do full-body scanning in an efficient way.The most basic method is holding the sensor by hand and walking around people, dragging the cords behind. 

The scan: Dat (left) pulls the console on the stand up and down while the subject pulls a pose. The whole process takes only one minute 

'I found some designs on how to build a turntable that a person could stand on. I also adapted a camera slider design to shuttle the Kinect sensor up and down. 

'I also determined what kind of computing power was needed to drive the 3D scanning and model generation. 

He added: 'It requires a very powerful graphics card to be able to process the scan data. Most of the calculations are done on the graphics card rather than the CPU.'
