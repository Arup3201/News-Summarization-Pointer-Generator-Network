Children as young as 11 have been victims of ‘revenge porn’, new figures have revealed.

School pupils are having their lives ruined by classmates posting explicit images – either obtained consensually or stolen – online without permission to humiliate them.

Adults have also been blackmailed into having sex with their tormentors after being threatened with having supposedly private images of them naked placed on the internet.

Demands for tough new laws to crack down on the humiliating practice have increased after celebrities, including pop star Rihanna and movie actress Jennifer Lawrence, fell victim to the cruel craze.

Figures uncovered using freedom of information laws revealed 149 cases of revenge porn in the last three years – although campaigners said this was the ‘tip of the iceberg’.

Of the eight police forces who responded, the number of incidents had risen from 35 in 2012 to 58 a year later. In the first six months of 2014, there were 56 cases reported – meaning the total is expected to double by the end of the year.

Worryingly, only six incidents resulted in a police caution or charge – meaning the culprits in many cases have escaped scot-free.

Police are largely powerless to stop the unpleasant practice until specific new laws intended to make revenge porn a crime, which are currently going through Parliament, are introduced.

Laura Higgins, of the UK Safer Internet Centre helpline, said the true scale of the problem remained hidden.

She said: ‘I feel this is just the tip of the iceberg. Plenty of people, particularly young people, won’t want to go down the police route or even speak about them at all, so many incidents are going unnoticed. 

‘Our research shows that for every site we find, there are potentially dozens with those images on which the victim has no idea about.

‘We are living in an age where technology is a part of our everyday lives, and children are becoming sexualised at a younger age.

‘But we must do what we can to tackle bullying, harassment and sharing explicit content without permission.’

Sarah Green, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ‘The ability to abuse through technology is growing fast and its impact is very real, which is why politicians and the police must get to grips with it.’

The survey revealed a girl aged just 11 from Manchester had indecent images of her posted on the internet.

In Cambridgeshire, a schoolboy circulated naked photos of a fellow pupil on Facebook so all her friends could see them.

In another case in the county, a taxi driver blackmailed a passenger into having sex after discovering naked images of her, and another man was coerced into having gay sex amid fears a woman would post naked photos of him on social media.

Former culture secretary Maria Miller, who has campaigned to stamp out the despicable trend, said the data showed revenge porn was more widespread than previously thought.

She said: ‘Police are finding it difficult to know how to react when incidents are reported. All of this points to the need for a clarification of the law, and also to make sure it’s clear revenge porn and the posting of it is a criminal offence. This is not a victimless crime - it is a sexual act against another individual.’

A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content. We encourage people to use our reporting tools to highlight anything they find unacceptable. If it breaks our rules it will be removed.’

Last week the Mail told how a young woman was left distraught after her ex-boyfriend sent naked ‘revenge porn’ pictures of her to her parents.

Hannah Davison, 21, was mortified when Christopher Todd sent an intimate photo of her to her mother’s phone after their break-up - in a message then opened by her father.

Todd, 22, from Boldon Colliery, Tyne and Wear, was given a suspended sentence for sending the offensive message, which claimed Ms Davison was spreading sexually transmitted diseases.
