Buildings are crumbling, heavily armed fighters stand on every street corner and snipers lurk on rooftops - welcome to Sirte.

The home city of Libya's fugitive leader Muammar Gaddafi is one of the last area's not to have succumbed to the militia army of the National Transitional Council.

These astonishing photographs show how the rebel fighters, as the NTC was previously dubbed, are slowly tightening their strangle-hold around the city - with pro-Gaddafi fighters now only occupying a tiny section.

The council today brought more tanks into the city to try to smash the last pocket of resistance in a bid to end the chaos which has now lasted several weeks.

It sees the capture of the city 
as key to building a democractic government - as it says the process 
cannot begin until Sirte has fallen. NTC commanders said Gaddafi's die-hard loyalists now only control a residential area which measures around one mile squared.

They also said that the biggest obstacle to taking the town had been Gaddafi's snipers hiding in the buildings. To counter this they were using tanks to hit the buildings from close range, which often dislodged them. Gaddafi himself is believed to be hiding somewhere in the vast Libyan desert.

A senior NTC official also denied 
reports by other officials in the new government that Gaddafi's son 
Motassim had been captured in Sirte.  

Surrounded now on all sides, Gaddafi's
 remaining forces in his home city seem to have no hope of winning the battle 
but are still fighting on, inflicting dozens of casualties with 
rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and small arms.

One field hospital received two NTC 
dead and 23 wounded yesterday. One of the dead men had been hit while 
taking food up to the fighters on the front line, doctors said.  

Another NTC commander said Gaddafi's 
besieged forces were no longer using heavier weapons and appeared to 
have lost their cohesion as a fighting force.  

'We've noticed now they are fighting 
every man for himself,' said Baloun Al Sharie, a field commander. 'We 
tried to tell them it's enough and to give themselves up, but they would
 not.'

NTC officers said Gaddafi loyalists feared reprisals if they give themselves up.

Some captured fighters said they have 
been roughed up by NTC forces.

Amnesty International issued a report on 
Wednesday saying Libya's new rulers were in danger of repeating human 
rights abuses commonplace during Gaddafi's rule.

The NTC said it would 
look into the report.   

Close to the centre of the fighting in
 Sirte, government forces found 25 corpses wrapped in plastic sheets. 
They accused Gaddafi militias of carrying out execution-style killings.

As the battle for Libya draws 
towards what the NTC and NATO hope will be a close, both the new 
government and the Western alliance which helped topple Gaddafi are 
looking towards a return to normality.  

The provisional Libyan government and 
NATO signed an agreement yesterday to immediately open air corridors for
 international civilian flights from Benghazi, and domestic flights 
between the second city and Tripoli and Misrata.  

This is one of the first step toward 
NATO lifting its no-fly zone over Libya imposed after Gaddafi began a 
military assault on civilians protesting his one-man rule.
