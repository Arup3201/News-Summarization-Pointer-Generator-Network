We know Botox can hide frown lines, prevent migraines and even ease excessive perspiration. Now women are requesting off-label use of the injectable to help prolong their blow-outs.

According to Yahoo Beauty, the procedure is becoming popular with some women 'so they can attend SoulCycle without getting their hair sweaty.'

Top New York dermatologist Dr Patricia Wexler says the improved hair quality is a benefit of Botox's effect on the sweat glands. 

An extreme solution to frizz-free hair? Botox is now being injected into the scalp in order that patients can have longer-lasting blow-dries

'It works exactly like injections for hyperhidrosis,' she tells Dailymail.com. '[Botox] inhibits the eccrine glands specifically.'

The result of reduced scalp perspiration is that a patient may experience less frizz and not have to wash their hair as frequently. 

Dr Wexler says that while the cost of the procedure can be 'prohibitive', she would recommend it if asked.

'It has few side effects if given in a safe dilution and dose,' she explains. 'It should be discriminately placed along the hairline and frontal area where frizz is most prominent.' 

Yahoo reports that one would need over 100 units of Botox to treat an entire scalp and the effects would last three months. 

But Dr Wexler says she would not advise the use of Botox on the whole head as it 'would not be practical from a cost or safety profile.'

While she has never injected an entire scalp, dermatologist Dr Francesca Fusco tells Yahoo that 'several women whose foreheads I have injected happily report decreased sweating at the hairline and temples.'

But dermatologist Dr Neal Schultz argues that the procedure is painful, expensive and not effective enough to be worth the patient's while.

He explains to Yahoo that only injecting the hairline will not prevent sweat on other areas of the scalp, so the rest of one's hair will likely still frizz or fall limp from sweat after a workout.

What's more, the thicker skin on the scalp means that Botox injections in that area will hurt more than those on the face, where the skin is thinner.

'The cost/benefit ratio isn't going to make sense, considering the lack of ability to stop enough sweating to make a real difference,' he said.
