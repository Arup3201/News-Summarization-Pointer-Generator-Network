A car that trailed an official motorcade carrying Sasha and Malia Obama on to Pennsylvania Avenue prompted a security lockdown at the White House Tuesday.

A U.S. Secret Service spokesman said the blue Honda Civic entered the security checkpoint at 17th Street and Pennsylvania and was immediately stopped by Secret Service uniformed officers.

The male driver, later identified as Internal Revenue Service employee Mathew Evan Goldstein, 55, was arrested and Washington DC police checked the car for explosives.
