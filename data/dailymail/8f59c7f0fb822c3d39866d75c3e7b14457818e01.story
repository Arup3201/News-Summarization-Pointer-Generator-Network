A&E departments will be closed or face cutbacks, forcing patients to travel further to casualty supercentres under new government plans.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today said a review of emergency services due tomorrow would not shy away from taking ‘difficult decisions’ as he hinted at closures.

It came as the government admitted it has held talks with private sector hospitals about treating NHS patients to ease pressure on the NHS this winter.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said 'difficult decisions' will need to be made over the future of A&E departments, raising the prospect of closures

The NHS's top doctor, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, will publish a report tomorrow on why the network of small unites across the country is not working.

The health service’s medical director is expected to argue that the most seriously ill patients should be taken to bigger super-centres – bypassing local units altogether.

He will argue that patients should be taken to larger hospitals, with more specialist doctors, even if it means they have to travel further.

In the Commons today, Labour said the A&E system was in crisis, after it emerged at least 12,000 patients spent 12 or more hours on trolleys in casualty units last year.

Another 250 waited for a minimum of 24 hours and one was left for 71 hours and 34 minutes.

Mr Hunt was called to the Commons to give details of the Keogh Review, because MPs break up for a mini-recess tonight.

He said the report will examine how to make it easier for the public to access emergency health care.

And he sought to pin the blame on Labour, accusing shadow health secretary Andy Burnham of failing to make the hard choices needed.

Mr Hunt added: ‘Why are we having an A&E review? It's to clear up the mess and confusion caused by 13 years of Labour mismanagement of our emergency services.

‘You talk about walk-in centres. Why were they introduced? They were introduced because of the disastrous mistake of the GP contract and the brave thing for (you) to do would be to admit that you got that wrong and reverse it.

‘But no, you didn't do that. You introduced a whole new raft of services which confused the public - A&E, walk-in centres, GP surgeries, telephone helplines.

‘Tomorrow sorts out those problems and, yes, there are difficult decisions. But they are decisions that your government ducked and left the public exposed as a result.’

The number of patients arriving in A&E has soared by a third over the past decade and 22million were logged last year.

Rising numbers of old people and the decline in out-of-hours care by GPs have been blamed.

Monitor, a hospital watchdog, warned the closure of 50 walk-in centres had piled further pressure on casualty units.

NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh has written a major report on A&E closures but shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused the government of presiding over 'the worst year for A&E in a decade'

Labour’s Mr Burnham said: ‘People are increasingly asking “Where is the Government and what is it doing about it?” So far all they have heard is “Crisis, what crisis?”.

‘What is going on and why are you running scared, blaming NHS England and trying to keep this House in the dark?’

Yesterday it emerged that Prime Minister David Cameron has taken personal charge of A&Es this winter crisis, demanding weekly updates on waiting times to prevent the government being hit by an NHS crisis.

Health minister Earl Howe today revealed that discussions had been taking place with private hospitals to see ‘whether and to what extent there is capacity to absorb elective care patients over the winter when needed’.

He said there was ‘everything to be gained’ from a process that had been adopted by the previous government.

‘We think it is right that the independent sector, where appropriate, should play its part in relieving the burden from the NHS.'
