Andrew Ross has been jailed for 11 and a half years after carrying out two armed robberies

A former soldier who carried out two terrifying armed robberies and a blackmail plot was caught after holding captive a detective disguised as a pizza delivery boy.

Ex-boxer and press-up world record holder Andrew Ross went on a shocking spree of serious crimes after falling on hard times.

Using an inside man at a North Shields hotel, balaclava-clad Ross burst in brandishing a knife and demanded that staff fill his bag with cash from the safe.

Ross shut two workers - including night shift manager Carl Riley, who was in on the plan - in a cupboard as he fled with more than £6,000.

He then held up a post office in South Tyneside, pointing a gun at a customer as terrified staff lay on the ground in fear for their lives.

A court heard Ross also blackmailed car garage businessmen in Sunderland, damaging vehicles when they refused to play ball with the crook's protection racket.

The 31-year-old former Nissan worker also falsely imprisoned an undercover police officer disguised as a pizza delivery boy during a police sting to arrest him for the blackmail.

Ross pleaded guilty to two robberies, attempted robbery, possessing an imitation firearm, blackmail, false imprisonment and affray. He was jailed for 11 and a half years.

Judge Penny Moreland told the ex-soldier, who once took part in a hostage rescue in Sierra Leone: 'You have qualities and potential for good and it is a great shame for a man who has potential for good to be being sentenced for offences such as this.'

The pre-planned robbery at the Village Hotel, at Silverlink, North Shields, took place on October 16, 2012.

Co-accused Riley was night shift manager at the hotel and made sure he was on reception around 2am when Ross was due to come in, before wedging the front door open for him.

Armed with a knife, wearing a balaclava and carrying a holdall, Ross came in and started demanding cash from Riley and another member of staff on reception, who he threatened with the blade.

Prosecutor Jolyon Perks told Newcastle Crown Court: 'Ross shut Riley and the other man in the cupboard, telling them to stay inside for at least 10 minutes.

'Eventually the other man kicked the cupboard door open and phoned the police. He was fearful he or Riley would be stabbed.'

Ross fled with £6,431 from the hotel safe and sped off in a Vauxhall Astra, with the help of two other men - named Daniel Walton and Mark Wright.

Riley pretended to police he was a genuine victim of the raid but phone records showed all four had been in touch in the lead-up to the heist.

Seven months later Ross, on police bail for the first raid, carried out a second robbery at Whitburn Post Office, in South Tyneside.

Again wearing a black balaclava, he burst in around 11.30am on May 24 last year, this time armed with a black handgun.

Customer Stephen Reid, a former soldier, said the weapon looked like a Beretta, but he couldn't tell if it was real or a fake.

Mr Perks told the court: 'Ross approached the counter and shouted: "Give me the money".

'Both women dropped to the floor and one of them crawled along the floor to the kitchen from where she contacted police.

'Ross pointed the handgun at Mr Reid, who stepped back against the wall with his arms raised.

'Ross moved towards the counter and kicked the counter door with full force but it held secure so he then turned back to Mr Reid, again pointing the gun at him, shouting: "Give me the f***ing phone".'

Having stolen the phone, Ross fled, screeching away in his getaway car outside. He was arrested around a week later and police found texts on his phone referring to the robbery.

However he was still on bail in January this year, when he started blackmailing two Sunderland business partners, damaging cars when they refused to bow to his demands that they pay him for protection.

Ross smashed the porch window at the home of one of the men and left a brick on the bonnet of the other's car as a warning.

Police were called and recorded a phone conversation between one of the men and Ross. A surveillance operation was set up.as a result.

On January 30 a detective was sent to Ross' home dressed as a pizza delivery boy in order to gain access to the block of flats covertly.

But as the undercover officer went into the block, Ross was coincidentally on his way out and became suspicious.

He went back to his flat, armed himself with a knife and returned to confront the officer, who was waiting for firearms back-up to arrive.

Mr Perks said: 'Despite yelling at him to get out, the defendant then deliberately trapped the officer in the lobby with him by locking the front door and standing between him and the exit.

'He then produced the knife from his waistband and brandished it at the officer. The officer pressed his radio panic alarm and at that point identified himself as a police officer.'

Ross then ran back to his flat and climbed out of a window onto the roof.

After a period of negotiation and him trying to smash his phone to hide evidence, he was arrested.

Ross, of Aidan House, Sunderland, had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2005, for which he was jailed for five years.

Riley, 24, of Gregory Road, Sunderland, pleaded guilty to robbery and was jailed for three years and nine months.

Walton, 24, of Milton Street, South Shields and Wright, of Stafford Grove, Sunderland, admitted theft and both got an 18 month suspended sentence with 200 hours unpaid work.

David Roberts, 21, of Raby Street, Sunderland, admitted handling stolen goods after selling Mr Reid's phone online. He got a community order with 100 hours of unpaid work.
