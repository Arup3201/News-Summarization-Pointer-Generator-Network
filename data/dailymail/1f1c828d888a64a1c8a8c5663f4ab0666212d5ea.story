One of Britain’s best-known shoe chains,  Barratts, has collapsed into administration for  the second time in two years.

Some 3,840 jobs are at risk if a buyer cannot be found to rescue the 191 Barratts and Priceless Shoes stores and the 371 concessions within  department stores.

The firm is the second casualty in two days on the High Street. On Wednesday outdoor clothing chain Black’s hoisted the ‘For Sale’ sign.

Tough times: Nearly 4,000 jobs were under threat after the owner of shoe shops Barratts and Priceless Shoes collapsed into administration

Yesterday Deloitte was appointed 
administrator of  Barratts. Spokesman Daniel  Butters said: ‘We will 
continue  to trade the stores whilst we seek a buyer for all or part of 
the  business as a going concern.

‘Barratts and Priceless Shoes have faced a downturn in trading as a result of the difficult  economic conditions.

‘This has been exacerbated by the unseasonably mild weather  in recent 
weeks which resulted  in fewer sales across new winter lines.’

Under owner Stylo, Barratts and Priceless survived being put into administration in 2009 when 220 of its 380 stores closed

The business first went into administration in 2009 and Deloitte was 
called in. Parent company Stylo threw in the towel and 220 of 380 stores
were shut.

Christine Elliott, chief executive of the think-tank Institute for 
Turnaround, said that while  Barratts is just one of many retailers 
facing difficulties, the blame falls squarely at the door of management.

Amid the many shoe factories of  Northampton, William Barratt started his mail order company.

W Barratt & Co invited customers to ‘Walk the Barratt Way’ in advertisements that first appeared in 1903 in the Carpenter and Builder journal.

The company’s Boots-by-Post service boasted that it sold ‘the World’s Best Brogues at Barratt’s Factory Price’.

In 1913, Mr Barratt built the W Barratt Footshape works, designed to look more like a big country house than a factory.

The company flourished to the extent that in 1964 it was bought by rival shoe company Stylo and made the firm’s principle brand. 

In 2008, Stylo – which had been founded in 1917 by Fanny Ziff, a 27-year-old Russian immigrant – purchased 24 stores from collapsed retailer Dolcis and rebranded them as Barratts.

But in 2009, Stylo put Barratts and its other brand Priceless shoes into administration, with 220 of its 380 stores closed down. 

The remaining 160 stores were bought by current Barratts owner Michael Ziff, former chairman of Stylo and a descendant of its founder.

‘This isn’t just an impact of the recession as some might think,’ she 
said.

‘The failures have been down to retailers not putting  into place appropriate systems and making changes when the warning bells first 
started ringing.

‘But this isn’t a sole example of a retailer going into administration for the first time,’ she added.

‘The reason they have failed again is that adequate changes to the operational business haven’t been made.

‘Shareholders and managers should be monitoring businesses and acting early to restructure before it is too late.’

Britain’s battered High Street chains have been struggling in recent months as austerity cuts bite into household budgets.

The challenging consumer  environment is having a mixed effect on Britain’s retailers.

The wealthy continue to splash out in upmarket stores such as Mulberry 
and Burberry, while hard-up consumers dodge mainstream chains.

Yesterday fashion chain Peacocks also looked like it was  adding to the 
gloom, but refused to confirm rumours it is in talks to shut 200 stores.

The discounter, which has 611 Peacocks stores and 394 Bon Marche shops, 
said: ‘We continue to progress our re-restructuring discussions and 
plans, with no decisions taken at this point.’

A raft of other household names – including HMV, JJB Sports and Game Group – are also thought to be struggling.
