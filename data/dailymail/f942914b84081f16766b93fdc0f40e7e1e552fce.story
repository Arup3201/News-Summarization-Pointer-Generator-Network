Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez was in action on Saturday night as Chile played out a goalless draw with Mexico at a sold out Stateside.

The 25-year-old, who joined the Gunners for £30million from Barcelona earlier this summer, played 85 minutes of the international friendly.

Opposition Mexico were forced to settle for a draw after squandering several good chances to score in the second half, with a crowd of 67,175 at the Levi's Stadium - the new home of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers.

The contest matched two teams that were eliminated in the Round of 16 at the World Cup in Brazil. Mexico lost to the Netherlands 2-1, and Chile lost to host Brazil in penalties after  a scoreless draw.

El Roja coach Jorge Sampaoli kept his World Cup roster intact for the friendly, while Mexico coach Miguel Herrera gave Miguel Angel Herrera and Oswaldo Alanis their first starts in an attempt to remold his squad, keeping 10 members from the Mexican World Cup roster.

Mexico, backed by the majority of the crowd, had two clear shots on goal in a two-minute span midway through the second half.

On 65 minutes Giovani Dos Santos found himself alone with goalkeeper Claudio Bravo but rushed his shot and missed over the crossbar.

Javier Antonio Orozco then fired a shot that was just high after receiving a cross from Oribe Perlata in front of goal on 67 minutes.

Bravo also stopped Miguel Layun's looping shot in the 77th minute and a point-blank shot from Orozco with 10 minutes remaining.

While Mexico will travel to Colorado to wrap up their US stay, Chile will take on Haiti on Tuesday at Lockhart Stadium in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
