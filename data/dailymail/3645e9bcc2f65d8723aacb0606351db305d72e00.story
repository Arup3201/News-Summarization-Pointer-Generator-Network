Nigel de Jong insists there will be no repeat of his infamous 'kung-fu' challenge against Xabi Alonso when the pair meet again at the World Cup on Friday.

Holland play Spain in the opening game of Group B in Salvador’s Arena Fonte Nova and the midfield duo are likely to feature on the same pitch for the first time since the 2010 final.

The Dutchman was only given a yellow card for that challenge but believes this will be a clean game.

‘That is in the past. It has nothing to do with this game,’ said De Jong. ‘It will be a different kind of game.’

Asked if he was honest on the pitch, De Jong said: ‘Yes, of course. That is how I am going to play in this game.’

Holland had the best record of any European team in qualifying for Brazil but are not among the favourites to lift the trophy.

De Jong thinks otherwise and said: ‘We can go far but only if we have the confidence and we stick together as one team.’
