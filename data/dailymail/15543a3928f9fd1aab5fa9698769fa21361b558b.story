Fake tan has come a long way since the days of streaky orange ankles and hard-to-use lotions that delivered an artificial pumpkin hue. Nowadays an abundance of sophisticated products promise smooth, fast, fuss-free application and achieve an extremely realistic result.

Such advances have also attracted a more discerning and stylish customer – step forward Kate Moss, the face of leading brand St Tropez’s new range, for which she appeared nude in a series of upmarket publicity shots. As she says: ‘St Tropez does it so well that you do look natural. You don’t have that fear, which I always did, of going streaky.’

But there has been growing disquiet in the scientific community about the safety of so-called fake bakes – specifically about their key ingredient: DHA. It is this chemical, dihydroxyacetone, that reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce the brown ‘suntan’ colour. It is also this compound that gives fake bakes their characteristic – often described as biscuity – smell.

Last year, a panel of American medical experts reviewed scientific studies on DHA for ABC News. They reported that tests on live animal cells had shown the chemical could cause DNA damage, which is linked to cancer, and toxicologists voiced their concerns about the possible risk.

Dr Chris Flower, Director General of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), admits that such concerns are leading companies to lower concentrations of DHA. And many new products claim to be completely free of the chemical.

But with a third of UK women and one in ten men using these products in an industry worth £100 million a year, the question remains: Is DHA safe or not?

RISE OF THE BOOTHS

The cosmetic use of DHA in tanning creams and gels was first approved by the American Food and Drug Administration – still the best international benchmark of safety and quality – in the 1970s.

Since then, however, sunless tanning techniques have changed almost out of recognition. While mousses, lotions and creams are just smeared on to the skin, the spray methods now in common use apply the concoction through the use of an aerosol.

There are three main types of spray tan. The simplest is the manual turbine spray, an ‘airbrush’ held by the beautician.

The second, known as a third-generation spray booth, consists of a closed compartment – similar to a shower cubical – in which, after a short countdown, three rows of nozzles spray a product on to the entire body. Turning around is not necessary as  the whole body is enveloped in fine mist.

The fourth-generation spray booth, in contrast, is open and contains two vertical rows of nozzles. The customer stands and turns around to allow the other side of the body to be sprayed.

These techniques give a faster, more even result – but they also increase the risk of absorbing DHA through inhalation and by contact with mucous membranes in the eyes and mouth.

It is this absorption that may  be dangerous. At the time of last year’s study, Dr Lynn Goldman, Dean of the School of Public Health and Health Services at George Washington University, said: ‘The substance seems to have a potential for what they call creating mutations, or changing DNA in living cells, which is  a serious problem and needs to  be further investigated, yet  hasn’t been.’

Although this is based only on lab tests on individual animal and bacterial cells, rather than observations in humans, she warned: ‘What we’re concerned about is not so much the reaction that creates the tanning, but reactions that may occur deeper down  with living cells – which might then change DNA, causing a mutation – and what the possible impacts of that might be. I’d be very concerned of the potential for lung cancer.’

Dr Rey Panettieri, a toxicologist and lung specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, also urged caution, saying: ‘The lungs have a huge surface area and these compounds could get into the bloodstream and promote the development of cancers.

‘[Regular inhalation] could potentially lead to cancer or the worsening of asthma or other lung disease.’

The risk would be most significant for those visiting salons frequently or for staff who spray the tan on to customers.

STILL SAFER THAN THE SUN

Dr Nick Lowe, a consultant dermatologist in the UK, believes the chemical to be safe – though he advises against inhaling it – and points out that his opinion is shared by most scientists.

‘Organisations such as the American Academy of Dermatology and the Canadian Dermatology Association state quite clearly that it is a safer method of acquiring a tan than intentional sunbathing or the use of tanning beds,’ says Dr Lowe. ‘There is no direct evidence DHA increases the risk of cancer but there is evidence that sunbathing does.’

WHEN FAKING IT, TAKE PRECAUTIONS

While the American Food and Drug Administration has approved DHA in traditional self-tanning creams and lotions, it states unequivocally that its use as a spray has not been approved, due to a lack of data.

The FDA recommends people protect their eyes, mouth and nose and do not inhale the spray. These recommendations echo a report in 2010 from the Danish Toxicology Centre, which advised using nose filters and eye protection in fourth-generation booths.

Yet when The Mail on Sunday contacted six leading UK tanning salons, all providing DHA-based spray tans from leading brands such as St Tropez and Mystic Tan, not one recommended or even provided any form of protection from inhalation or absorption.

Indeed, the idea was discouraged because, as one beautician said, it would ‘leave you with  an outline’.

DIY IS BEST, BUT FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS

‘It’s important to follow instructions on the packet and the most important thing for spray-tan is to use the product in a well ventilated place,’ says Dr Flower.

‘We’ve heard that people have been wheezing and coughing, but that happens with any aerosol product and we suspect that a few people have used too much  in a small room. Some people apply it in the shower, where there is no fresh air, and that is not a good idea as it could make you cough and sneeze.’

THE COCKTAIL EFFECT

So just how safe is your fake bake? Well, experts seem to agree that DHA is not harmful unless  it gets inside the body. So as long as you take precautions and don’t plan on eating your fake bake instead of putting it on your skin, it needn’t be a problem.

There are some dissenting voices. Elizabeth Salter Green, Director of Chem Trust, a UK organisation that investigates the safety of man-made chemicals, argues there could be a ‘cocktail effect’. While ingredients may be well tested on their own, daily life exposes us to a huge variety of chemicals at once, with potentially unforeseen consequences.

These concerns, however, have been widely dismissed as scare-mongering. Dr Emma Meredith, Head of Scientific and Technical Services at the CTPA, says: ‘DHA has recently been reviewed by the European Commission’s independent scientific committee, which oversees the safety of cosmetic ingredients and confirmed it is safe in cosmetic products.’

Nonetheless, devotees of spray tan booths might want to think carefully – or even, if you dare, abandon the fake tan altogether and embrace the pale and interesting look.
