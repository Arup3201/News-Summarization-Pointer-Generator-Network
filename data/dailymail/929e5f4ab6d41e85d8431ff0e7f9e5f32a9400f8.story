Fears are growing that Al Qaeda's thwarted underpants bomb plot is just one of a number of terrorist plans to bring down aeroplanes.

A senior law enforcement source said other devices, similar to the 'undetectable' one discovered this month in Yemen, could be ready to be deployed by other would-be bombers.

He told the New York Times: 'If they built one, they probably built more. That's the scary part.'

The startling admission comes as U.S. counter-terrorism officials said they thought the mastermind of the latest underpants bomb plot was killed during a CIA drone attack in Yemen on Sunday.

Dear: Was senior Al Qaeda leader Fahd Al-Quso, killed on Sunday by a drone strike, behind the updated underpants bomb plot

Fahd Mohammed Ahmed al-Quso, one of 
America's Most Wanted terrorists, wanted to bring down a U.S.-bound 
jetliner with a new and improved 'undetectable' version of the underwear
bomb that failed to detonate aboard a jetliner over Detroit in 
Christmas 2009.

The explosion was to be carried out, reports suggest, to mark the one year anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden.

But the Yemen-based terrorist was killed by a missile fired by an unmanned CIA drone as he stepped out of a vehicle in a remote valley in the south of Yemen.

Two counter-terrorism officials told the New York Daily News they believed 37-year-old al-Quso, who had a $5million bounty on his head, was the key militant behind the plans.

Al-Quso was indicted in the U.S. for his
role in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in the harbour of Aden, Yemen,
in which 17 American sailors were killed and 39 injured.

He was later believed to have replaced Anwar al-Awlaki as the Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula's head of 
external operations when the latter was killed in a U.S. airstrike last year.

The FBI is now examining the latest bomb to see whether it could have passed through airport security and brought down an aeroplane.

The device did not contain metal, 
meaning it probably could have passed through an airport metal detector.

But it was not clear whether new body scanners used in many airports 
would have detected it.

Senator
Dianne Feinstein, of California, who heads the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, said yesterday she had been briefed about an 'undetectable' 
device that was 'going to be on a U.S.-bound airliner.'

There
were no immediate plans to change security procedures at U.S. airports.

But there are reports, in the U.S. media, that last week the plot led the U.S. to order scores of air marshals to Europe to protect U.S.-bound aircraft.

Flights out of Gatwick Airport, in England, reportedly received 100 percent coverage, according to U.S. sources.

The would-be suicide bomber, based in Yemen and believed to be working for al-Quso, had not yet picked a target or bought his plane tickets when the CIA stepped in and seized the bomb, officials said.

New York Congressman Peter King, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said counter-terrorism officials had said of the wannabe bomber: 'We don’t have to worry about him any more.'

He is alive, officials added, but they would not give any further details.

White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said President Obama learned about the plot in April and was assured the device posed no threat to the public.

'The president thanks all intelligence and counter-terrorism professionals involved for their outstanding work and for serving with the extraordinary skill and commitment that their enormous responsibilities demand,' Hayden said.

The operation unfolded even as the White House and Department of Homeland Security assured the American public that they knew of no Al Qaeda plots against the U.S. around the anniversary of bin Laden's death.

'We have no credible information that
terrorist organisations, including Al Qaeda, are plotting attacks in 
the U.S. to coincide with the anniversary of bin Laden's death,' White 
House press secretary Jay Carney said on April 26.

On
May 1, the Department of Homeland Security said, 'We have no indication
of any specific, credible threats or plots against the U.S. tied to the
one-year anniversary of bin Laden's death.'

The Associated Press learned about the thwarted plot 
last week but agreed to White House and CIA requests not to publish it 
immediately because the sensitive intelligence operation was still under
way.

Once officials said those concerns were 
allayed, the Associated Press decided to disclose the plot despite requests 
from the Obama administration to wait for an official announcement.

The decision to delay the announcement has led to some speculation that Obama was 'electioneering'. But this has been dismissed by his camp.

U.S. officials, who were briefed on 
the operation, insisted on anonymity to discuss the case, which the U.S.
has never officially acknowledged.

It's
not clear who built the bomb, but, because of its sophistication and 
its similarity to the Christmas bomb, authorities suspected it was the 
work of master bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri.

Al-Asiri constructed the first underwear bomb and two others that Al Qaeda built into printer cartridges and shipped to the U.S. on cargo planes in 2010.

Both of those bombs used a powerful industrial explosive. Both were nearly successful.

Al-Asiri, of Saudi Arabia, was believed killed in a drone strike last year, but Yemeni officials quickly denied his death.

The operation is an intelligence victory for the United States and a reminder of Al Qaeda's ambitions, despite the death of bin Laden and other senior leaders.

Since the death of bin Laden in a daring U.S. Navy SEAL raid on his Pakistan compound, the terror group is believed to have shifted its interests from Afghanistan to Yemen.

The terror group has taken advantage of Yemen's political turmoil in the past year, gaining territory and strength.

It has set up terrorist camps and, in some areas, even operates as a de facto government.

Yesterday, Al Qaeda militants staged a surprise attack on a Yemeni army base in the south, killing 22 soldiers and capturing at least 25.

The militants managed to reach the base both from the sea and by land, gunning down troops and making away with weapons and other military hardware after the blitz attack, Yemeni military officials said.

But along with the gains there also have
been losses. The group has suffered significant setbacks as the CIA and
the U.S. military focus more on Yemen. 

The new Yemeni president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, has promised improved cooperation with the U.S. to combat the militants.

On Saturday, he said the fight against Al Qaeda was in its early stages. Hadi took over in February from longtime authoritarian leader Ali Abdullah Saleh.

Since the terror attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001, Al Qaeda has put different types of plans into action in numerous Jihad plots. While none of the plots have been successful, they have brought change to airport screenings and other security measures.
