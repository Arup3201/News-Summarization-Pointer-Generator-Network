A divorced Spanish father has been ordered to pay nearly £300 a month to his 31-year-old daughter - because she cannot find a long-term job.

Amador López, whose real name has not be released by the court, was estranged from daughter Clara until 2005, when he was told by a judge that he must support her through an undergraduate and postgraduate degree.

He initially refused to pay the 500 euros (£360) a month but his bank account was frozen.

Mr López, who owns several cars including a BMW, appealed the decision in 2014 but was told by Spain's Supreme Court that he must continue to support his daughter by paying 400 euros (£289) a month.

A divorced Spanish father has been ordered to pay nearly £300 a month to his 31-year-old daughter - because she cannot find a long-term job. People queue outside a job centre (above) as Spain suffers from one of the highest youth unemployment rates - up to 53.5 per cent in November 2014

Although Clara has had several short-term jobs, she has not been able to find anything permanent since graduating. 

Rosalia Bello, the lawyer who represents Clara, said the case was unique. 

'The really unprecedented thing about this case is that the support is open-ended,' The Daily Telegraph reported her saying. 

The decision comes just months after a father from Cádiz, Spain, was ordered to pay his 29-year-old daughter 500 euros a month while she completed her psychology degree.

The percentage of 25 to 34-year-olds living with their parents varies across Europe. 

In 2014 Denmark had one of the lowest rates with only two per cent of the age group neglecting to fly the nest.

Mr López initially refused to pay the money but had his bank account frozen, according to his daughter's lawyer

In the UK 15 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds still lived with parents - but in southern and eastern European countries like Spain and Italy it was as high as 70 per cent.

At the same time Spain suffers from one of the highest youth unemployment rates - up to 53.5 per cent in November 2014. 

This was in comparison to an EU average of 21.9 per cent and was well above Germany, which had the lowest rate of youth unemployment with 7.4 per cent.

Sara Elder, an economist with the International Labour Organisation, said it was a 'very scary' time for young people across Europe. 

She said: 'These people are delaying their advance into adulthood.'
