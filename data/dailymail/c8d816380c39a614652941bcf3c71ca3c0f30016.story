The notorious king of New York’s Club Kids who was jailed for murdering his drug dealer has told how he feels nothing but 'shame and disgust' at his crime.

Michael Alig, whose life was portrayed by Macaulay Culkin in the 2003 movie Party Monster, was freed last week after serving more than 17 years in prison.

Alig, now 48, who masterminded some of the most extravagant parties of the early Nineties, pleaded guilty to bludgeoning the winged drug dealer Andre 'Angel' Menendez to death in 1996.

Michael Alig, the notorious king of New York’s Club Kids in the late 1980s who went to prison for murdering his drug dealer in 1996, has been freed on bail

He then poured bleach into his mouth, dismembered his body with knives and disposed of his corpse in the Hudson River.

'Eighteen years on, looking back at the person I was, I feel nothing but shame and disgust,' he said in an interview with the New York Post.

'I
 was a selfish junkie who killed another human being. But that's not the
 Michael Alig I am today, or the Michael Alig I was before I became an 
addict: the misfit from South Bend, Indiana, who came to New York in search of acceptance, opportunity and a whole lot of fun.'

His accomplice, roommate Robert Riggs, otherwise known as 'Freeze', was also sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison after he confessed to manslaughter.

Originally from Indiana, Alig moved to New York in the early 1980s to attend Fordham University but later dropped out and became involved in the New York underground club scene as a promoter.

Even before his conviction, Alig and his fellow Club Kids had grabbed national attention for their outrageous Manhattan dance parties that showcased sex, rampant drug use and over-the-top costumes.

Macaulay Culkin's portrayal of Alig assisted his cultish rise to international fame, particularly in London

Party Monster, the 2003 fiction account of Alig's life starred Macaulay Culkin as infamous NYC club promoter Michael Alig, right, and Seth Green as his friend James St. James

The story of Alig's rise and fall was 
first told in the 1999 book Disco Bloodbath written by his best friend 
and fellow Club Kid James St James.

The book detailed St James’ friendship with Alig and how it fell apart as Alig's drug addiction worsened and ended after the death of Melendez.

It later became the basis for Party Monster, the 2003 fiction account of Alig’s life starring Culkin and Seth Green as St. James. Parole officers allegedly denied Alig parole in 2006 after watching the debauched movie.

A cult hit, the film has helped maintain interest in Alig and despite nearly two decades behind bars he has 11.7K followers on Twitter. According to his blog 'he has had many offers of work, and even more requests for interviews and shows.'

His social media accounts were maintained by a friend while Alig was inside, although he has tweeted several times since his release on Monday morning.

‘Just narrowly escaped being re-arrested for having my release filmed but we’re ok and in (sic) our way to nyc! #narrowescape,' he tweeted of his departure from prison.

'Happy to be free and so grateful for this second chance. Can’t wait 2C @JSJDarling at dinner. #frenemy.'

Another tweet said: 'W/all these cams following now I know what @KimKardashian feels like ! #keepingupwiththeclubkid.'
