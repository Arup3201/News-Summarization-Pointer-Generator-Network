Behind bars: Taylor Kelly, 18, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after police say she fired a shot at a friend in a bulletproof vest - but missed

A South Carolina teenager was charged with involuntary manslaughter after police say she fired a shot at a friend in a bulletproof vest, but missed the Kevlar and struck him in the heart.

Anderson County Sheriff's Lt. Shelia Cole said Blake Wardell, 26, found an old flak jacket early Wednesday morning in Greenville, put it on and asked 18-year-old Taylor Kelly to shoot him.

Kelly fired a single round from a small-caliber handgun at the vest, but just missed. Authorities say the bullet went through the lining and into Wardell's heart.

Investigators say they have found no evidence of heavy alcohol or drug use at the scene of the crime.

If convicted, the recent graduate of Belton Honea Path High School faces up to five years in prison.

She remains in the Anderson County jail awaiting a bond hearing.

Church Road at around 2.45am and discovered a man lying in the garage 
with a gunshot wound to the chest, Fox Carolina reported.
