The first wife of disgraced doctor Geoffrey Edelsten and lover of media commentator Clive James has allegedly been assaulted by one of Kings Cross's most notorious figures.

It sounds like a bad Hollywood script but Leanne Nesbitt, who was married to Mr Edelsten from 1984 to 1988 and in 2012 admitted to having an eight-year affair with author and broadcaster Mr James, was allegedly assaulted by Kings Cross identity Bill Bayeh on Sunday.

Bayeh, 56, was allegedly involved in an argument with Ms Nesbitt, 51, who is now an intensive care nurse at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. She graduated in 1992 from the University of Technology, Sydney with a nursing degree.

Police allege Bayeh pushed Ms Nesbitt in the chest on Sunday night outside the hospital.

It's understood Ms Nesbitt, who works as an intensive care nurse, was on her way to work when the altercation occurred. Kings Cross police arrested Bayeh and charged him with common assault. 

It was the second time in four days Bayeh was dragged before the police station of his old stomping ground.

He's accused of struggling with police before being handcuffed.

Police charged Bayeh with hindering police and resisting arrest. He is due to face court next month over both incidents.

Bayeh told police he didn’t know Ms Nesbitt.

Ms Nesbitt lived a glamorous lifestyle as Mr Edelsten's wife before the pair split in the late 80's.

The Daily Telegraph reports that Ms Nesbitt was just 19 years old when she had her first encounter with Mr Edelsten in July 1983.

She was a young up-and-coming model and he was a high-flying doctor, and a very high-profile member of Sydney’s elite.

She blew the lid on the 'secret' relationship with the expat Aussie in an interview on A Current Affair.

'We had an instant attraction. Attraction is a very personal thing. It was our secret,' she said.

'I don’t know whether its got to do with experience, intelligence, I’m not sure. (But) He’d leave men half his age for dead.'

It was the second time in four days Bayeh had been arrested. On Thursday night he was charged with hindering police and resisting arrest in Kings Cross
