As his girlfriend got out of the car to get food at a gas station, 47-year-old Michael Dunn turned to her and said 'I hate this music' - commenting on the loud bass coming from a parked SUV with four teens inside.

Before she could get back to the Volkswagen with wine and chips, Dunn had shot up the SUV, eventually killing 17-year-old back passenger Jordan Davis.

Opening statements in the white engineer's murder case began today in Jacksonville, Florida, with both sides revealing more details on how the fight about volume turned deadly in November 2012.

Too loud: Michael Dunn (left) is facing a first-degree murder charge for fatally shooting 17-year-old Jordan Davis (right) in an argument about speaker volume in November 2012

Defense: Opening statements began in Dunn's trail today in Jacksonville, Florida. He is also facing three charges for attempted first-degree murder for the other passengers in the car

Dunn has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder for the other passengers in the car.

Dunn's defense attorney Cory Strolla says he was only trying to defend himself, after seeing Davis grab what looked to be either a shotgun or a lead pipe.

But prosecutors say the four men in the vehicle weren't armed, and while they did disrespect Dunn, they never threatened the man.

Assistant State Attorney John Guy says the four men were out for a day of 'mall hopping and girl shopping' when they decided to stop at the gas station to get gum and cigarettes.

Before coming over to tell the men to turn down their music, Dunn town his girlfriend 'I hate this music' as she walked over to the convenience store.  

Like this: Shawn Atkins, a witness for the prosecution, shows how he saw Dunn shoot that day. Atkins is currently in prison and tried to leverage for a lighter sentence in exchange for testifying

Dunn then went over and 'politely' asked the men to turn their music down - which was so loud it was rattling the windows.

Davis responded rudely telling one of his friends 'f*** that n*****' and to turn the music back up.

Guy says both Dunn and Davis exchanged the f-word in the ensuing argument, but that Davis never threatened the older man.

However, defense attorneys say Dunn never cursed at Davis and that Davis got much more explicit in their fight.

According to Dunn, Davis threatened: 'I'm going to f****** kill you. You're dead, b****. This is going down now.'

Aftermath: Instead of turning himself in, Dunn and his girlfriend drove 40 miles south to a bed and breakfast and ordered pizza. Above, the couple's Volkswagen

They also say Davis reached for a weapon, which Dunn believed to be either a gun or a lead pipe, and seemed to be getting out of the car, prompting Dunn to take out his 9mm pistol and shoot three times at Davis' door.

Dunn shot each of Jordan's legs and the third bullet tore through the teen's liver, lungs and aorta.

Dunn claims to have owned the gun for years but never used it before that occasion.

But prosecutors say Davis couldn't have gotten out of the car since the child locks were on. The defense pointed out that friend Leland Brunson, who was in the car at the time, initially told police that Davis was getting out of the car, but changed his story four days later.

Despite the driver of the SUV backing up to drive away, prosecutors say Dunn continued to barrage the car with gunfire.

Another point of contention is what happened immediately after the shooting and whether or not the four teens had time to hide the weapon Dunn claims to have seen.

Prosecutors say the teens had no time to hide a weapon since they never left the parking lot. A police search of their vehicle only turned up a basketball, basketball shoes, some clothing and cups on the floor but 'no weapons'.

The defense on the other hand says the boys drove off to an adjacent parking lot first before returning to the gas station to call 911. Police didn't search the area around the gas station until several days later, giving the men 'ample time to get rid of a firearm or pipe'.

Strolla points out that two witnesses initially reported that the teens seemed to be stashing something, and that two of the passengers in the SUV were unaccounted for a period after the shooting.

As for Dunn, when his girlfriend Rhonda Rouer heard the shots, she left her food and change at the counter and ran out to their car.

Instead of turning himself in, the couple drove 40 miles south to St Augustine where they had a reservation at a bed and breakfast. The two ordered pizza, took the dog for a walk and Dunn 'poured a big, tall drink - rum and Coke.

'They had cell phones, but they didn't call 911. He didn't drive to a police substation,' Guy said. 'That defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep.'

Hiding out? Dunn told interrogators the day after the shooting that he didn't turn himself in because he wanted to get things settled at home first

The next day they saw a news report on TV about a 17-year-old who had been fatally shot at a gas station in Jacksonville, and instead of calling police then, they drove 130 miles home to Satellite where police caught up with him

The defense attorney blames most of that strange behavior on Dunn's girlfriend, who ordered the pizza because she hadn't had much to eat all day and was hungry.

They decided to go home the next day instead of turn Dunn in because Rouer was 'petrified' and 'didn't know the law of self-defense'.

A day after the shooting, Dunn told interrogators he 'was waiting till we get around people we know' to turn himself in.

He wanted to make sure his dog and 'everybody were where they needed to be. I did not want to being a s***storm down on them in Jacksonville'.

The prosecution may have a problem in their case when it comes to witnesses. 

The witness who took down Dunn's license plate is currently in prison and tried to leverage a lighter sentence for agreeing to testify.

And the teen driver of the SUV was on probation and violating curfew when the incident happened.

In the end, the defense painted Dunn as a man who could have been a victim if he hadn't taken out his gun that day.

'God didn't make all men equal. Colt did. Colt is a firearm,' Strolla said. '(Dunn) had every right under the law to not be a victim, to be judged by 12 rather than carried by six.'

Prosecutors say the teen was innocent, and did nothing to provoke a gun being fired.

'Jordan Davis was sitting in his car seat with the door closed with nothing in his hands,' Guy told the jury.

The trial is expected to conclude as early as February 14.
