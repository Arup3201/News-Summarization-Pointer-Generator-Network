Sukvinder Mannan, 32, killed Rebecca McManus, 21 (above), when he lost control of his car

A salesman is facing a 'substantial' prison sentence after admitting killing a talented student when he ploughed his out-of-control car into a bus stop where she was stood waiting with a friend.

Sukvinder Mannan, 32, lost control of his powerful Mitsubishi Evo and crashed into Rebecca McManus, 21, and her friend Harriet Barnsley in Smethwick, West Midlands.

Miss McManus, who was waiting at the bus stop near Birmingham city centre ahead of a hen party, died at the scene from her injuries. 

Miss Barnsley, 21, was seriously injured in the crash on May 31 last year.

Mannan, from Dudley, West Midlands, admitted causing death by dangerous driving at Wolverhampton Crown Court today and was warned by a judge that he faced a 'very substantial prison sentence'.

The sales representative also pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and admitted failing to provide a blood sample following the crash.

Before court proceedings started, Judge Andrew Lockhart QC described the case as a tragedy, adding that Miss McManus's family had suffered an enormous loss.

The court heard that Mannan had previous convictions from 1999 for driving without insurance and taking a car without consent.

After hearing Mannan's guilty plea, Judge Lockhart said: 'He will undoubtedly receive a very substantial prison sentence.'

Mannan was handed an interim disqualification from driving and sentencing was adjourned for pre-sentence reports.

He was bailed with strict conditions, including surrendering his passport and applying for travel documents. He was also told to live and sleep at his West Midlands address and to report every week to his local police station.

Miss McManus had just finished a three-year English Literature and Creative Writing degree at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and was due to graduate just a month after the crash happened.

She previously attended St Paul's School for Girls in Edgbaston and studied A-levels at King Edward's in Stourbridge.

She had not received all of her grades from her university work but had already received a first class mark in her poetry dissertation and had seen some of her work published.

Her parents Gerard and Catherine McManus, from Oldbury, West Midlands, have previously spoken of their anguish at losing their much-loved daughter.

Mrs McManus, 48, said: 'She did not have a bad bone in her body. Everybody loved her and the last three years at university had been the best of her life.

'She was very popular and had kept in touch with everybody from her school days.

'You always worry about your children - but for me it was always about them returning home, rather than on their way to a night out.'

Mr McManus added: 'She was such an eccentric character and very individual.

'She always did her own thing and even won a debating contest when she was at school dressed as Phantom of the Opera.'

Following her death, tributes from teachers, friends and fellow students described how Miss McManus was an 'irreplaceable loss'.

Floral tributes at the scene of the crash described her as 'one of the nicest people I've ever met'.

Lynsey Grant, who stopped to help Miss McManus shortly after the crash, left a card to her family, which said: 'We are so sorry for your pain.

'Please know that these young ladies were cared for with urgency and compassion by all at the scene. 

'My heart and thoughts are with you.'
