Accrington Stanley have parted company with manager James Beattie by mutual consent.

The 36-year-old was appointed as manager last May after initially joining the club as a player-coach in the previous November.

Beattie saved the club from relegation last season, but a disappointing run of results this term which has seen Accrington claim just one win in their opening six league fixtures leaves the League Two side in 21st place.

They were also knocked out of the Capital One and Johnstone's Paint Trophy competitions earlier this term.

Beattie ultimately proved to be a success in his maiden campaign at the Crown Ground and led the team to 15th place, despite being reported to have the smallest budget in the Football League.

An emotional Beattie is believed to have addressed the players earlier this afternoon to inform them he would be leaving.

Assistant manager, Paul Stephenson, will now take the team for Saturday's visit of AFC Wimbledon.

'It is with a hugely heavy heart that I decided to end this journey,' Beattie said in a statement.

'I can never fully repay the faith and backing I got from the players, my staff and of course the fans - who always gave me 100%.

'I thank them from the bottom of my heart for granting me the opportunity and privilege to be part of your unique club.'

The job Beattie did in keeping the club with the smallest budget in the Football League last year has not gone unnoticed by Leeds United, who are understood to have been in touch over their vacancy.
