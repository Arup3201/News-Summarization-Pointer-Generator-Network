Top secret papers used to break the Enigma Code were discovered at Bletchley Park - because they were used as draught excluders.

The papers include the only known examples of 'Banbury sheets' which were devised by Alan Turing to speed up the process of decrypting Nazi messages. 

They were found in Hut 6 of Britain's main codebreaking centre, codenamed Station X, in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in September 2013 by builders who were renovating the unit. 

They are the only examples of Banbury sheets ever to be discovered.

The documents, pictured above, were discovered screwed up between the roof beams of Hut 6 at Bletchley

All paper evidence from the codebreaking centre was supposed to be destroyed for security reasons, but some paperwork survived after it was placed into holes in the walls and ceilings to protect codebreakers from the cold. 

During the war, Hut 6 had poor heating, no toilets and nothing in terms of insulation. 

Betty Webb, from Wythall in Worcestershire, who is now in her 90s, was a member of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS).

She worked on German police messages in the mansion at Bletchley Park, which revealed the beginning of the Holocaust with the massacres of thousands of Jews on the eastern front.

'The huts we slept in were thrown up in a great hurry and had thin walls so in the winter one's flannel would be frozen by the morning. 

'They were very, very basic conditions, but we were young, we didn't mind,' she said.

Bletchley Park's codebreakers provided vital intelligence which helped win the Battle of the Atlantic. 

Their contribution to the war effort is told in The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing. 

Turing was praised by Winston Churchill as having made 'the single biggest contribution' to the Allied victory.

The British mathematician and pioneer in computer science hastened the end of the Second World War by cracking Germany's wartime communications code. 

Notes made by the Bletchley codebreakers during the Second World War (pictured above) were found along with parts of an Atlas, a pinboard and a fashion article from a magazine in the space between the roof beams

He devised the process of 'Banburismus' in 1940 in order to glean information about the likely daily setting of the Enigma machine used by the Germans to encrypt messages. 

It involved aligning two Banbury sheets and placing them over a light. If two holes corresponded, then the light would shine through and using this, likely settings could be deduced.   

Bletchley Park has now undergone an £8million renovation to restore the codebreaking centre. 

The papers found in Hut 6 have been frozen to prevent decay and will go on display there next month. 

Ian Standen, chief executive of the Bletchley Park Trust, told The Times: 'Discovering these pieces of code-breaking ephemera is incredibly exciting and provides yet more insight into how the codebreakers actually worked.

'The fact that these papers were used to block draughty holes in the primitive hut walls reminds us of the rudimentary conditions under which these extraordinary people were working.'

The work carried out in the mansion at Bletchley was kept secret for decades and many of the women who worked there thought they would take their experiences to the grave

In the early 1940s, Britain was losing the Battle of the Atlantic and was on the verge of being invaded by Germany.

Geniuses were needed to crack the highly cryptic code Germans used to communicate with their U-boat submarines.

Turing's top-secret work with cryptologists at Britain's main decryption centre at Bletchley Park saved countless lives by breaking Germany's Enigma machine code.

The codebreakers were bound by the official secrets act and forbidden to utter a word of their mission. 

And Turing was praised by Winston Churchill as having made 'the single biggest contribution' to the Allied victory.  

But the computer pioneer received no credit and as a gay man in an era when homosexuality was illegal, was convicted of gross indecency in 1952. He committed suicide two years later. 

He was only pardoned for charges of homosexuality 60 years after his death in 1954.

The story of Turing and the codebreakers is told in The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley.

It has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Cumberbatch's performance.

Betty, today, left and right during the war, said she struggled to find a job after Bletchley because she wasn't able to tell anyone what she had been doing in the Forties

A handwritten notebook by mathematician Alan Turing is expected to fetch $1million at auction in April
