Sunderland fans who made the 630-mile round trip to see their side humiliated 8-0 by Southampton are set to receive just £24 each in compensation from the players.

In the aftermath of their embarrassing defeat, goalkeeper Vito Mannone vowed to speak to his team-mates about refunding the 2,600 supporters who made the journey.

Many had paid £152.50 for a return train ticket, but they are set to receive just £24 to cover the cost of the ticket for the game and not their rail fare.

Sunderland fans were left stunned as their side was thrashed 8-0 by Southampton on Saturday

Sunderland had already subsidised away tickets – which originally cost £34 – to save each supporter £10 as part of their Away Supporters’ Initiative.

The logistics of working out how much each fan was owed depending on how they got to St Mary’s Stadium would prove too complicated to refund them for travel.

The worst moment of the afternoon was when Santiago Vergini scored one of the own goals of the season with a first-time volley, from the edge of the box, past his own goalkeeper.

That goal, in only the 12th minute, set the tone for the game before Sunderland capitulated to one of the worst defeats in Premier League history.

But the defender has apologised to the club’s supporters and admitted his mistake had a huge impact on the way the game went.

Vergini said: ‘I take full responsibility for this and after my error the game really did change.

‘The account we gave of ourselves was embarrassing. We have to look forward now and try to improve for the following game.

‘I thank the fans for their excellent support as always and I would really like to say sorry to them for the very poor account we have given of ourselves.

‘The first step is to accept the errors we committed and we have to be aware that we are responsible for what happened here.’
