Usain Bolt has set his sights on winning Commonwealth Games gold at Hampden- after joking that his only complaint about Glasgow 2014 is that the Scots keep trying to get him drunk!

The Jamaican superstar came under fire this week after he was quoted in a national newspaper saying the Games were ‘a bit s***’ and that the London Olympics in 2012 ‘were better’.

However, after anchoring his country’s 4x100m team to first place in their heat last night amid raucous backing from the Hampden crowd, the 27-year-old global megastar went on a major charm offensive.

I can hear you, Glasgow: Usain Bolt got a great reception at Hampden Park despite bad press this week

Appreciated: Bolt was the star turn at Hampden and he thanked the crowd for his reception

Describing Glasgow and its athletics crowds as ‘brilliant’, Bolt insisted he wouldn’t be leaving Scotland without the Commonwealth Games gold medal he needs to complete his collection. And, asked what he had made of Scottish culture so far, he insisted with a grin that locals had been constantly trying to ply him with alcohol.

‘For me, it’s different,’ he said. ‘Most people – even the caretakers – have been trying to give me beer or wine. But it’s been fun and I’ve had some good laughs.

‘It’s been wonderful here. It felt like I was competing at the London Olympics all over again. I really appreciated it. I love competing in front of a crowd like that – for me it’s just brilliant.

‘I always go to every country I visit with an open mind and to see what they represent and what they are all about. I go to enjoy it and to see the country. I came to Scotland with an open mind and it’s been fun. The people have been wonderful to me. It’s been just great.

‘But I need a gold. That’s very important for me.’

Bolt admitted Glasgow’s weather has been colder than he would have preferred. But he insisted that he never once considered pulling out of the Commonwealth Games in the wake of this week’s controversy. Instead, he sought to put further distance between himself and the reported comments that caused such a stir ahead of his keenly-awaited appearance at the national stadium last night.

‘No, I never thought of leaving because it was a lie,’ said Bolt.

‘And I was never worried (about a bad reception from the Hampden crowd). I know my true people would know I would never say anything like that.

All alone out in front: Bolt saw off a late surge from Nigeria's Mark Jelks to claim top spot in the heat

‘She (the journalist) asked me how I was and I said I hadn’t done very much, that I had just been in my room. She asked if it had been fun and I said: “I guess, but I haven’t really been out.”

‘But she interpreted that as me saying it was ‘a bit s***’ or whatever.

‘I can’t believe she actually said that. First of all I would never use that word if I was going to say that. The people here have been so good to me so I would never say something like that.

‘It was rough because everyone wanted to say something to me but I did not want to say anything because last time I had a simple conversation it turned out worse for me. I decided I would wait till I had a chance to speak.

'Now listen carefully...': Bolt gives an interview to BBC Sport after finishing the job for Jamaica in the heats

‘But it’s been great here, everything has been good so far. It’s just the weather, it’s really cold.

‘For me I love competing in team events as well as individual events and I’m just happy to be a part of this team and to be part of these Commonwealth Games. It’s great to be part of a team, feel the vibe, enjoy and have a laugh and be as one representing your country.

‘I’m very happy for my team-mates. We did very well tonight.’
