With rubbish strewn across the living room, dishes stacked high in the sink and a filthy bathroom, this semi-detached house in Birmingham appeared to be every estate agents' nightmare.

But the three-bedroom terrace in Erdington has sold for the full asking price, after a buyer saw through the filth to bag an investment.

The images on property website Zoopla revealed wall-to-wall squalor with unmade beds, piles of clothes thrown across rooms and food and rubbish left discarded on the kitchen floor.

Despite being marketed with pictures revealed a spacious kitchen complete with piles of dirty dishes and rubbish strewn across the floor, this house in Erdington, Birmingham has sold for the full asking price, less than month after it went on the market

The generous lounge featuring camping chairs and stepladder among the debris, didn't appear to put off the new owners, who snapped the three-bedroom home up for £114,950

Despite the images, estate agents Burchell Edwards, took on the challenge marketing the property for £114,950 and optimistically describing the it as a 'period style' house featuring 'Minton tiled flooring' in the vestibule and a 'generous lounge'.

The property details also boasted a 'family bathroom' and a third bedroom 'bigger than your normal sized third bedroom' as well as being just half-a-mile from Erdington Train Station and local shops.

The kitchen diner was described as featuring 'a range of wall and base units incorporating a one-and-a-half bowl stainless steel sink with drainer, integrated appliances to include oven, hob and microwave'.

The property was viewed 14 times by prospective buyers and was on the market for one month before being snapped up for the full asking price.

Burchell Edwards would not reveal the buyer’s identity but said it was a commercial investor and contracts were being exchanged to transfer ownership.

Meanwhile the mystery buyer described their new investment as 'a palace'.

The agent who described the third bedroom as being 'bigger than your normal sized third bedroom', refused to reveal the identity of the buyer but said it was a commercial investor

The wipes, rubber gloves and cleaning spray in the property's family bathroom clearly never had much use, but the filth has not deterred the new owner, who described the property as a 'palace'

The house was listed on property site Zoopla.co.uk, where it was described as a 'traditional period style property'

A traditional period style property set back off the road in need of modernisation.To the ground floor is a generous through lounge that could be split back into two receptions if required and access to the kitchen with a utility room towards the rear.To the first floor is a family bathroom and three bedrooms two of them are doubles and the third is bigger than your normal sized third bedroom.There is also a front and rear garden, the property is available with no chain.

The proud new owner said: 'These are my palaces. It [the condition] will turn off ordinary folk, so the price is driven down and is more attractive to someone like me.

'I’m surprised the bank has let them [the previous tenants] leave it in that state. It’s not in a person’s interest to leave it like that.'

A neighbour said the home belonged to a middle-aged couple who left the property just before Christmas.

The 40-year-old, who did not want to be named, said: 'They kept themselves to themselves, but I did know them to say hello.

'There could be many reasons why they left. They might have had to look after a family member, you just don’t know.'

The outside of the property appears respectable, giving no hint of the squalor that hid behind the door
