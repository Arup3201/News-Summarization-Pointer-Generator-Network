To six-year-old Aston Bradford-Disney, big brother Dane has always been a hero.

But now it looks like the 10-year-old could truly be a life saver, after donating his bone marrow to his little brother who has leukaemia.

All of Aston's family, from Church Gresley, in Derbyshire, were tested to see if they could help him, but it was Dane who turned out to be the best match.

Aston is still desperately ill in hospital and his family are by his bedside anxiously waiting to see if his body will accept the tissue.

The family described Dane as 'a total hero' after the operation went ahead at Sheffield Children’s Hospital last week.

Aston needed a bone marrow transplant to give him a chance of going into remission after a programme of chemotherapy failed to beat the childhood cancer.

After family members flocked to offer their assistance Dane proved to be a perfect match, and gave up his bone marrow in an operation last week.

Little Aston remains in hospital, with his father, Mark Disney, a constant presence at his side.

The boys’ aunt, Sharon Hussain, from Burton, said: 'Aston has handled it all amazingly and doesn’t moan or complain about anything. He’s a little superstar.

'When we were told he would need a donor we all said straight away we’d do it. It turned out two of his brothers were a perfect match, so we chose the eldest.

'Dane is a total hero but he just wanted to make his brother better. I’m sure when they are older they will really appreciate each other.

'For
all the chemotherapy he’s had Aston has done really well, and was in 
remission and out running around before his operation, so to see him at 
the weekend and how poorly he was, it just made me cry.'

While Dane is now out of hospital, the family are anxiously monitoring Aston’s condition at Sheffield Children’s Hospital.

Mrs Hussain said: 'His body has got to accept the bone marrow into the system, because it’s a foreign body. It’s just a waiting game now.'

Diagnosed with leukaemia in June, the youngster has spent most of the past five months on the children’s cancer ward at Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre, and his family are planning a series of fund-raising efforts to thank the staff there who cared for him.
