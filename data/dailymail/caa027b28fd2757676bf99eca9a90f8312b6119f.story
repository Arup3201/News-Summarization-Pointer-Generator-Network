Tiger Woods has taken refuge on board his yacht with his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn after a tough weekend on the golf course.

Woods and Vonn were spotted boarding his boat, called Privacy, on Sunday night in Miami Beach after he played in the Cadillac Championship tournament.

Vonn is no stranger to the yacht, and was spotted there before she officially announced that she was dating the professional golfer months after his infidelities were revealed.

Getaway: Tiger Woods and Lindsey Vonn were seen taking a golf cart to his yacht Privacy on Sunday night in Miami

On board: Vonn, who couldn't participate in the Olympics because of her injured knee, is seen wearing a brace as she and Woods board his yacht

The yacht has been Woods' retreat of choice for years and he even spent his honeymoon with his ex wife Elin Nordegren on board.

The $57million vessel was also reportedly her wedding gift, but it seems that she didn't get to keep it as part of the $100million divorce settlement she received after their 2010 split.

His getaway with Vonn comes after she spent much of the weekend watching Woods play in both the Cadillac Classic and the Honda Classic before that.

She was seen watching on the sidelines with Woods' 6-year-old daughter Sam.

Time off: The length of their boat stay is unknown but the yacht has been seen in Miami all week

'Lindsey and Sam were seen laughing and joking around with one another,' an onlooker told E News.

'Lindsey and Sam at one point were holding hands and hugging. They were fooling around most of the time. They watched Tiger for three holes. They all seemed like a normal, happy family. They were all laughing and smiling, enjoying the day.

'Lindsey looked like she was having a great time and looked like a good mom, paying Sam lots of attention.'

Settling in: Vonn and Woods were accompanied by a member of his entourage who was wearing a matching red shirt

Pricy: Woods bought the yacht for $57million as a wedding gift to his ex wife Elin in 2004 but it appears that he kept it in their 2010 divorce

Lindsey and Sam kept to the side but were luckier than two other onlookers.

Woods accidentally hit two spectators with his golf ball on Sunday, leaving one of the men bleeding from the head.

Bonding time: Vonn cuddled up with Sam while they watched Tiger play and they seemed very comfortable

Woods went over and apologized to the men after each of the incidents, and gave them signed gloves in response.

He ended the day with a six-over par 78, beating only two of the field's 68 players.

When it came time to board the 155-foot yacht, Woods' children were nowhere to be seen.Â
