Would-be glamour model Josie Cunningham has called breastfeeding 'vile and borderline incest' in an online dig at new mother, singer Kimberley Walsh.

Cunningham, who sparked outrage after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, gave birth to her third child, daughter Grave Neiv, last month, but she went onto Twitter this morning to say she was not breastfeeding her.

In an apparently unprompted jibe, the 24-year-old from Leeds told her 58,700 followers: 'Wish people would stop asking if I'm breastfeeding like Kimberley Walsh.

'No I'm not! I think the idea is vile and borderline incest!'

Would-be glamour model Josie Cunningham, 24, seen leaving hospital with her new baby daughter Grace earlier this month, left, said today that she wasn't breastfeeding her because it was 'vile and borderline incest'

Miss Cunningham went onto Twitter this morning to make a dig at former Girls Aloud star, Kimberley Walsh

Despite Twitter users replying to her calling her 'ignorant' and 'vacuous', Cunningham hit back at those saying breastfeeding was 'natural'.

She wrote: 'People saying it's natural.... Maybe it was before powdered milk - in the same way it was 'natural' to walk around naked before clothes'

And she concluded: 'But you would soon kick off if I started walking around naked. It's time to change.'

New mothers replied to Miss Cunningham expressing their outrage, with one, Mathilde, saying: 'I'm all for choice about feeding but saying bf is 'incest' is seriously wrong and misleading, get a grip.'

She added: 'The worrying thing is that younger women will read her stupid tweet and agree.

'This is beyond stupid.' 

Another, Elaine Reith, tweeted Miss Cunningham to ask: 'Are you uneducated also?

'A woman's breasts are for feeding her child.  Nothing disgusting about it!' 

Lactation consultant Emma Pickett, who is also chairman of the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers, told MailOnline it was 'sad' that Miss Cunningham had apparently 'lost sight of what her breasts are really for'.

Her tweets prompted a huge response amongst her 58,700 followers, some of whom called her 'ignorant'

Many Twitter users questioned Miss Cunningham's logic, while a breastfeeding expert said it was 'sad'

She said: 'Having breasts is not just about having nice big ones to attract men, they are about us being mammals and are also for feeding our babies.

'I am sure Miss Cunningham's baby doesn't see it the same way - in the mind of a baby, breastfeeding is the most obvious and natural thing in the world.

Kimberley Walsh, who had a baby boy last month, has told she found breastfeeding difficult at first

'Our statistics show that the majority of new mothers want to breastfeed, whatever they think before giving birth'

Ms Pickett added: 'Apart from the health benefits to babies, there are health benefits for breastfeeding mothers, too, including a reduced risk in breast and ovarian cancer and osteoporosis.

'Maybe Miss Cunningham has lost touch with what her breasts are for but lots of young women are working really hard right now to get breastfeeding up and running.' 

A spokeman for the NCT parenting charity said: 'We support parents however they choose to feed their baby. 

'If parents want to breastfeed, it can offer significant health benefits for mother and child.

'Parents who need support feeding their baby can get a range of information on our website, and we also offer individual support services including Baby Cafés and breastfeeding counsellors.'

Miss Cunningham, who already has two boys aged six and three, gave birth to her first daughter last month, three weeks after Miss Walsh, 32, gave birth to her first child, a son named Bobby.

Last week Miss Walsh, a former member of Girls Aloud, spoke about how difficult she had found it to feed Bobby, her son by her long-time boyfriend Justin Scott, saying it was 'distressing'.

She said she had thought it 'would be the easiest thing in the world', but had problems at the start before finally 'cracking it'.

'It can be quite distressing when it's not working, but we've definitely cracked it now and it continually gets easier,' she wrote in OK! magazine.

Today the singer would not be drawn into a row with her critic, saying nothing on Twitter beyond posting a link to a dress she is giving away to raise money for a breast cancer charity. 

Tweeter Mathilde told Miss Cunningham what she said was 'seriously wrong' and added: 'get a grip'

Elaine Reith, who said she was a breastfeeding mother herself, said Miss Cunningham 'needs to be educated'
