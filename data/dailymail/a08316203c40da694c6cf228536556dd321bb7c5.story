This is the amazing moment a heroic hippo saved a gnu from certain death.

After being bitten by a crocodile, the large antelope is seen being dragged slowly under the water.

But just in time, a nearby hippo is seen making its way across the water to help the animal in its hour of need.

In grave danger: The gnu struggling to get to the bank of the river is dragged back by the crocodile

The incredible rescue happened on the Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya

The gnu is getting weaker by the second but the hippos are closing in

After chasing the giant crocodile 
away, the unlikely hero is then seen guarding the creature and even 
nudges the gnu to the edge of the river in effort to move it out of 
harms way.

The jaw-dropping 
moment stunned onlookers including Israeli photographer, Vadim 
Onishchenko, 34, who managed to capture the rare moment on camera.

Captured whilst on safari in Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya, the exhausted antelope later managed to escape to safety.

Onishchenko said: 'It was an incredible moment, the hippo actually tried to push it out of the water and then guarded the gnu to prevent the crocs getting close.

In its panic the gnu ends up swimming further back into the water, with the crocodile holding on tightly, it is now the hippo begins to intervene

'I have heard of cases where the 
animals instinct is to protect the other species, I think the hippos 
parental instincts took over.

'The
 hippos are probably the only animal not afraid of the crocs and I would
 even say the hippo is the only animal the crocodiles are afraid of.

'I was shooting the scene from our vehicle for more than two hours.

'We saw the gnu escape the water but it stood there for quite a while as I think it was in shock.

'When we left the animal was still ashore and seemed uninjured but we had to leave as it was getting dark.

'Even our safari guide was stunned by the hippos behaviour, he said he had never seen anything like it before.

'It was certainly an unforgettable moment, I feel honoured to have seen such a spectacle.'
