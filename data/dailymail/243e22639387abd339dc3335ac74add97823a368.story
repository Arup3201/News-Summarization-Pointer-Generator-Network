A woman who spent $500,000 creating a one-of-a-kind three-story closet has opened the luxury space up to the public for a children's cancer charity fundraiser - three months after a burglar broke into the 'she cave' and stole $1million worth of luxury goods which have yet to be returned to her. 

Despite her experience, Theresa Roemer, from Houston, Texas, didn't hesitate to offer up the luxury wardrobe as a venue for charity Kids Need More, who run a special holiday camp where adolescent cancer patients can escape the harsh realities of their diagnosis and let loose for a week of fun.

'I'm a woman of my word, and I told everyone this closet was built for fundraising and that's what it's intended for,' Ms Roemer told ABC Eyewitness News. 'Why would I let someone who wasn't invited to my home ruin that?'

Ms Roemer's own son died in a car accident in 2006 and she is eager to work alongside any charities that will better the lives of children.

'Ever since my son passed away, and I wanted to fill that gaping hole in my heart; it just seems like if I can help kids, it helps fill that void a little bit,' she added. 

'I just feel like my son didn't get his chance to build his legacy in life, so I'm going to do it for him.'

Shortly after the robbery, Ms Roemer was contacted by the thief who claimed that many of the designer items stolen from her wardrobe were actually fakes. He demanded that she pay him $500,000 or face being exposed to the press.

After refusing to bow to his demands, the fashion lover discovered that the stolen items had been sent to the local press, before being turned over to the police.

Now, all she can do is wait until officials determine who is responsible for the crime - and whether the recovered goods are in fact the actual stolen items.

'They tend to think they're from Houston, and they're gang-related because of where the cell phones have pinged from,' she revealed.

But of all the items taken from her, the one that she is most eager to recover is a priceless locket which contains a piece of her late son's hair and is now being used by the police as evidence.

The former Miss Texas is also eager to clear up any rumors or misconceptions about the robbery - and about the legitimacy of her other remaining designer items.

She insists that spending $500,000 designing the unique storage space, only to then fill it with fake handbags and jewels would make her 'the dumbest person in the world' and adds that the police and her insurance company have been provided with receipts proving the value - and authenticity - of the stolen items.

Since the robbery, which took place while her home was undergoing renovations, Ms Roemer has increased her security in the hopes of preventing future incidents.
