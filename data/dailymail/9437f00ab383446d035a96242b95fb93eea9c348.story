A week after learning the details of how his daughter was gruesomely killed at the hands Malcolm Naden, Mick Peet discovered drama students were making a play about the search for the convicted killer.

Previously Australia's most wanted man, Naden spent nearly seven years on the run including months as a fugitive hiding in Gloucester bushland in northern NSW before his capture and arrest in March 2012 and last year sentenced to life in jail for crimes including murdering two women.

On Wednesday, Mr Peet was shocked when he learned Gloucester High School HSC drama students are making a play based on the fugitive's time hiding from the authorities.

Mick Peet was shocked and angry about drama students' plans to make a play about the man who murdered his daughter Lateesha Nolan

'There's been quite a fair bit of backlash towards it (the play) from concerned people,' he told MailOnline. 'I don't want Naden represented as a Ned Kelly-style person.'

'I was partially in shock when I read about it, it seemed like they wanted to make a comedy about it,' Mr Peet said of his first impressions.

The satirical piece aims to 'poke fun at the situation and how people responded but with serious undertone', one of the students involved with the play previously said, as reported in the Daily Liberal.

Students also plan to explore the local reaction to the manhunt, how this impacted tourism and the affect it had on popular culture after things such as hamburgers were named after Naden.

Mr Peet, of Bundarberg in Queensland, said he was also concerned that students were asking the community to help develop the play's plot by requesting people provide their stories about near encounters with Naden.

Lateesha Nolan was reported missing in January 2005, but Mr Peet only just learnt the full extent of Naden's brutality in early June after requesting to read the murderer's 25-page confession including details about how his 24-year-old daughter was strangled to death in Dubbo.

Concerned about Naden being glorified, he contacted the school straight away and has since been liaising with them about the play.

Mr Peet said he feared the play could glorify Malcolm Naden, pictured after his capture in March 2012, and create the notion he is a Ned Kelly-type figure

Monster: Mr Peet said Naden should not be thought of as a hero after he gruesomely murdered two women

In a return email, the Gloucester High School year 12 drama group assured Mr Peet their intention was not to 'glamorise' Naden.

'We are aiming to expose the the idea that the myth does not resemble the reality,' the email reads.

'Our aim has always been to paint Naden as a monster but in fact the play is about our town's response to his presence in our region.

'The play aims to expose human folly, in this case the idea that a town can be swept up with a romantic notion of a Ned Kelly-type bushman when in fact he is anything but.

'It is not our intention to explore the actual murders that took place other than to refer to the fact that he did indeed commit these heinous crimes.'

The email concluded by recognising Mr Peet's and his daughter's bravery. 'With your permission, (we) would like to refer to this aspect of her character in the play.'

Mr Peet said the play did not 'seem right' to him but he had offered to contribute and work with the students to expose Naden for what he really is.

'I'm dead set against him (Naden) becoming a Ned Kelly character - he was a wanted murderer who killed two girls and got lucky stealing from people to survive,' he said.

'Him being a "great bushman", he was just stealing, he would have starved, that's how he survived.'

'I'm trying not to get upset, but never would I think of doing a play about Ivan Milat and all the backpackers killed.'

Mr Peet said the play had stirred up memories of the murder and had been 'pretty distressing' for his family and also the family of Naden's other victim Kristy Scholes. Both women were related to Naden by blood or marriage.

'There are two lots of families involved and all the extended family - it's hard, a lot of people just can't hear his name,' he said.

Naden spent months hiding from police in bushland in the town of Gloucester, located in northern NSW

Calling the timing of the play too soon, Mr Peet said it was especially raw after he recently spent four hours with police, who travelled from Sydney to Queensland, reading Naden's confession - something he explained to the school in his email.

'I don't want to talk about Naden because he's a criminal. The things I read were like they weren't human. What he did to my daughter is unbelievable, things you never get over and never being found (her body), it's a hard thing,' he said. 'It's hard to believe another human being can do that to another.'

'He strangled her from behind in a car, she put up a good fight for three minutes but what he did after that I cant even repeat it's that horrible. You see horror movies but this is real life - I thought I was reading a horror book.'

'He made a name being hard to catch, but you have to think about these two girls.'

Mr Peet said he still held hope that his daughter's body was found. He added that Lateesha should be remembered as the hero after she stood up for young girl, who had been molested by Naden.

At the time of Naden's sentencing, Mr Peet read a victim impact statement and described the killer as a 'souless figure'.

Mr Peet's ex partner is Naden's aunty, but he said the murderer was barley recognisable when he saw him in court.
