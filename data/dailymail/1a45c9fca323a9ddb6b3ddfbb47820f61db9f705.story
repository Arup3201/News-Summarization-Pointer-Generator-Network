In Star Trek, Starfleet personnel are able to communicate with each other by simply pressing a badge on their chest.

And now, thanks to a new device called Onyx, groups of 15 people can chat just as easily by using a similar wearable clip.

Onyx groups can be controlled using an app, and the clips have been designed for emergency situations, but also when you’re hands are full and you can’t use your phone.

The $99 (£62) circular, plastic Onyx is clipped onto a shirt, jacket or bag strap.Pressing the button in the centre enables the device, and when the LED ring lights up, users can speak into the built-in microphone

The $99 (£62) circular, plastic Onyx is clipped onto a shirt, jacket or bag strap. 

Pressing the 'comm-button' in the centre enables the device, and when the LED ring lights up, users can speak into the built-in microphone.

The message is sent to all other connected Onyx wearers, who are warned about an incoming message by a beep.

The wearable device was inspired by combadges worn in Star Trek.

In Starfleet, the combadge replaced standalone communicators in the early 24th century.

Combadges were used by Starfleet members to communicate with each other while on board ships, including the USS Enterprise.

Combadges were also configured to act as universal translators.  

A network of Onyx users can be anything up to 15 people, but devices can be attached to multiple networks.

These groups are controlled using OnBeep's free iOS or Android app.

However, the clip only works when connected to a phone, and contacts, using Bluetooth.

‘The idea behind Onyx was born from [our] experiences as emergency responders’ said the San Francisco-based developers.

‘During an incident, an emergency responder needs to be able to communicate with the rest of the team without losing focus.

‘The last thing you want is to have your attention pulled away from the scene in an emergency. To make that possible, we rely on two-way radios.

‘They’re bulky, ungainly and cumbersome, but they’re reliable - and that’s what matters when you’re working in life-or-death situations.’

The wearable device was inspired by combadges worn in Star Trek (still from 2003 film Star Trek: Nemesis pictured). Combadges were fitted to their uniforms and used by Starfleet members to communicate with each other while on board ships, including the USS Enterprise

However, the firm added that people don’t need to be in a life-or-death situation to use Onyx.

‘Whether you’re juggling grocery bags or working behind the scenes to put on a major event, we wanted to deliver the same effortless user experience to everyone.
