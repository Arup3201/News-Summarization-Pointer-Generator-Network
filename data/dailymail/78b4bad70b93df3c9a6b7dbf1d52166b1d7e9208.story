With Christmas approaching, Suzie Oulton was determined to treat her four closest friends to a top-notch gift.

So the 38-year-old was delighted when she spotted scented candles from luxury fragrance brand Jo Malone being sold on eBay for £18 — £4 less than their usual retail price.

'I'm a great fan of Jo Malone products but I have a tight budget,' says Suzie, who runs her own company and lives with husband Chris, 40 and 15-month-old Harry in Lydham, Shropshire.

'I checked they were being sold by an established seller and scanned the reviews. Previous customers seemed satisfied so I thought I had found a bargain.'

But a week later, Suzie was to discover that the candles she'd bought were anything but a good deal. In fact, they were a potential death trap.

She had unwittingly fallen for what experts have dubbed the new wave of 'middle-class fakes'.

These are copycat goods — often priced almost as high as the original, so as not to arouse suspicion — and replicas of everyday brands popular with middle England, rather than copies of designer goods.

Other mid-market labels now on the counterfeiters' hit list include Cath Kidston, Hunter wellies, Links Of London, ghd hair products and top make-up brands. A Which? survey concludes that one in ten shoppers have unwittingly bought a fake, with 7 per cent of goods sold in the UK are said to be counterfeit.

Shopping online is a particular minefield. In April, a specialist police unit shut down more than 2,500 websites selling counterfeit goods to British customers that were believed to be worth tens of millions of pounds. But with an estimated 72 million web links to infringing material this year alone, this is a drop in the ocean.

With Christmas fast approaching, shoppers are trawling the internet for last-minute bargains — and you can be sure criminals are on the prowl to get some of this money.

'Behind many of these websites lies an organised crime gang funnelling off the money spent by unsuspecting customers on what they think are quality products,' says Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fyfe, head of the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit.

'Consumers also need to be aware that by accessing websites like this they are running the risk of their personal details being compromised and being used for other fraudulent scams, as well as exposing their computer to viruses.'

A trip to one of Kent Trading Standards' warehouses to the south of Maidstone in Kent provides ample evidence of the problem.

Here, the team is working its way through two recent shipments of dodgy goods intercepted at Dover, targeted at Christmas shoppers.

Counterfeit designer goods are worth £3 billion a year in the UK — sometimes even experts struggle to spot the fakes 

Among the 5,470 seized items were 1,960 toys, including 426 copies of dolls from the Disney film Frozen.

In the second consignment seized, there were more than 4,000 counterfeit ghd hair straighteners, intended to be passed off as the real thing.

Meanwhile, in a separate locked container are bags of other counterfeit goods that have been confiscated over the past 18 months. It's a roll call of all the most popular High Street brands.

There are piles of Superdry sweatshirts, fake Hunter wellies, which usually sell for around £90, sacks full of UGG Australia rip-offs and shelves bursting with fake make-up from covetable brands such as Bobbi Brown and Mac. Seventy per cent of these fakes will have hailed from China but they also come from India, Turkey, Indonesia and Thailand.

As quickly as officers clamp down on one lot of fake goods, another market springs up as High Street fashions and trends change.

Trading Standards regularly seize suspect items. Out of 5,470 recently seized items 1,960 were toys, including 426 copies of dolls from the Disney film Frozen

This year's incredible boom in Frozen merchandise is a case in point. The Disney film has proved to be the most lucrative ever thanks to the appetite for the spin-off goods. But with genuine Frozen toys in short supply in the run up to Christmas, sellers peddling counterfeit versions are moving in.

The new iPhone 6 is also on the scammers' hit list. Copies of a new gadget can be manufactured within two weeks of the genuine product hitting the High Street, so counterfeit versions have been flooding in and some are on sale for as little as £18 (the genuine Apple version costs more than £500).

Luxury perfumed candles are another boom — the UK market alone is worth £90 million. As one of the most popular brands, Jo Malone finds itself at the forefront of this battle against fakes. With the imitations costing a maximum of £3.50 to produce, there's some serious money to be made — at someone's expense.

Regrets: Suzie realised she had been duped the moment she opened her parcel

Suzie Oulton realised she had been duped the moment she opened her parcel. She says: 'The first giveaway was that the jars were not right. The glass was quite thick but one of the candles was broken and the rims weren't at all smooth.

'When I lit one of the candles, it smelt of furniture polish, then spat and crackled like a firework. It was a fire risk.'

Angry that she had been tricked, Suzie contacted the seller, who was selling the fake candles on eBay, only to be stonewalled.

'I think it is despicable that someone was willing to sell fake candles to unsuspecting customers. They might be only thinking of making a quick profit but they could have burnt our house down,' she says.

Suzie had a lucky escape. Candles from another batch of copied Jo Malone candles exploded when tested by Trading Standards.

Counterfeit make-up, meanwhile, can contain banned ingredients such as lead, copper, mercury, arsenic or cadmium, which can lead to swelling, rashes and poisoning. Test on fake perfumes, meanwhile, have found horse urine and harmful ingredients that can cause allergic and skin-burning reactions.

Leon Livermore, of the Trading Standards Institute, stresses: 'There are significant risks to buying counterfeit goods, especially electrical products, which could cause fires or shocks — or children's toys, which could be untested and unsafe.'

Real deal: Jo Malone finds itself at the forefront of this battle against fakes

But a new breed of ruthless 'entrepreneurs' purposefully targeting middle-class customers is ignoring these dangers

Last week, the BBC programme Fake Britain reported on a case in the Home Counties where two women, Debra Buckingham, 53, and Mary O'Sullivan, 44, were running what amounted to a small cottage industry producing rip-off Jo Malone candles. They were buying in cheap, wax-filled glass jars and then adding fake Jo Malone branding, using stickers printed to look like the original labels.

They finished off the job with imported copies of the signature engraved lid. They were then selling these copycat candles at craft fairs, fetes and markets across the South-East at a considerable mark-up.

When the South-East Regional Organised Crime Unit visited Buckingham's sixth-floor flat in Hanger Lane, West London, they found a mini production line. There were more than 200 of the inferior candles in jars, at least 10,000 of the fake labels and 4,000 silver lids.

'This pair were really making some quite significant profit,' says Graham Miles, the unit's financial investigator, who estimated the pair had made £210,000 from this illegal operation.

The two women have since been successfully prosecuted at Lewes Crown Court, with Buckingham receiving a 12-month custodial sentence and O'Sullivan, who played a lesser role, given 240 hours of community service.

Another ploy used by sellers to target middle-class customers is to sell their fake goods at 'hand bag' parties — the successors to Tupperware parties — or on Facebook in order to give themselves a veneer of respectability.

Fiona Taylor, 44, of Newton on Ouse in North Yorkshire, sold fake bags for hundreds of pounds by doing this, using her ill-gotten gains to fund a luxury lifestyle that included private school fees, holidays and a new car.

Beware when Christmas shopping: If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is

In August this year, Teeside Crown Court was told that Taylor sold fake Mulberry bags she'd bought from counterfeit suppliers in China and sold them at parties as the real thing.

She told her middle-class customers that she got hold of them through a contact at Mulberry's factory.

But disgruntled customers contacted Trading Standards when the bags fell to bits. When Taylor's home was searched, a large number of fake Mulberry, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada and Chanel bags were seized.

Another of these 'entrepreneurs' rumbled this year is 27-year-old accountant Maddison Hawk from Oxfordshire. Her company Perfect Strand Limited was doing a roaring trade in fake ghd straighteners and hairdryers imported from China — which burst into flames just seconds after being switched on.

Oxfordshire Trading Standards team leader Anu Prashar, who helped the prosecution, said a customer could have been seriously injured. 'It was extremely lucky that this happened during a test, rather than when somebody was using the product, as it could have resulted in serious injury.'

It seems that as long as our appetite for branded goods continues to grow, so will counterfeiting. And that means there are plenty of greedy, shady sellers hoping to swindle consumers who will be left with shoddy or dangerous products. It's not really in the spirit of Christmas, is it?
