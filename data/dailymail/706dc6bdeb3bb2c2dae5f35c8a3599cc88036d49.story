The one-time lawyer and closest confidant of legendary 'Tonight Show' host Johnny Carson has revealed the moment the notoriously mercurial star broke down in tears when he discovered his wife was allegedly cheating on him.

Having been roped into breaking and entering the secret Manhattan apartment of Joanne Copeland, Carson's second wife, attorney Henry Bushkin and the entertainer discovered a virtual shrine of photographs to pro-footballer Frank Gifford - confirming Carson's greatest fears.

As Carson began to weep, Bushkin, who was aged only 27 during the clandestine 1970 raid recalls that the multi-millionaire television host's raincoat had fallen open to reveal a .38 revolver in a holster on his hip.

Now 70-years-old, Bushkin's revelatory tale is just one of many he recounts in his memoir, 'Johnny Carson', that charts the 18-years he worked for the comedian as his lawyer, wingman, fixer and closest confidant and hits bookshelves on October 15th.

Indeed, the pair were great friends and Carson frequently referred to him as 'Bombastic Bushkin' in many of his opening monologues on 'The Tonight Show'.

Recalling how Carson, who during the 70s and 80s was the nation's highest-paid entertainer, co-opted him into the break in, Bushkin says that his boss said, 'I have reason to believe my wife is cheating on me.'

'I also have an idea who the son-of-b***h' is that she's shacking up with'.

Carson had married Joanne Copeland on August 17th, 1963, but by 1970 he suspected that she was having an affair with retired NFL player Frank Gifford - famed for his exploits on the field, as a commentator and today as the husband of 'Today' show host Kathy Lee Gifford.

Indeed, the two men were arguably as famous as each other at the end of the 1960s.

While Carson spent thirty years as host of 'The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson' from 1962 to 1992, in 1970, Frank Gifford was poised to become host of ABC's 'Monday Night Football'.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, Gifford, 83, was an NFL Champion in 1956 with the New York Giants, an eight-time Pro-Bowl selection and his #16 Jersey for the Giants is retired.

While the events that Bushkin recalls took place a full 16-years before Gifford married Kathryn Lee Epstein, Bushkin is adamant about how that secretive break-in turned out.

Approaching the apartment on the East Forties of Manhattan near First Avenue, Buskkin says that Carson was accompanied by Joe Mullen, a licensed New York private eye, lock-picker Mario Irizarry and Arthur Kassel 'a security expert/crime photographer/police groupie.'

Bushkin recalls standing in the rain outside the apartment thinking that as a 27-year-old recent graduate of Vanderbilt Law University he was about to break the law, not uphold it.

Johnny Carson was best known for his 30 years from 1962 to 1992 as host of the 'The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'He dominated American light entertainment and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1992His influence extends to the current crop of late-night hosts such as his successor Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien and he was a particular hero to David LettermanAn article in The New Yorker by Kenneth Tynan from 1978, included the following question and answer:Tynan: 'When you're at home, whom do you entertain?"Carson: 'My lawyer, Henry Bushkin, who's probably my best friend.'Henry Bushkin was Carson's lawyer of 18 years. Until their falling out in 1988, the two remained business partners and great friendsHe died in January 2005

'Johnny looked over at me. 'Don’t worry, kid,' he said reassuringly. 'Nothing’s going to happen to you. Trust me,' writes Bushkin in an extract published by Entertainment Weekly.

Joanne was Johnny Carson's second wife. His first, Jody, was a childhood sweetheart and together they had three sons, Chris, Ricky and Cory.

However, as Johnny's fame grew and the temptations around him grew stronger, Carson's first marriage failed and ended in divorce in 1963.

Indeed, within months of this he married Joanne, a former flight attendant who had once worked briefly as a hostess on television for the game show called 'Video Village'.

However, seven years later, Bushkin recalls standing outside the apartment about to essentially break-in and enter to prove her infidelity.

Bushkin, who now splits his time between Los Angeles and New York writes that he suggested an ingenious defense for the gang should they be caught inside the home.

'Let me ask you,' I said, 'does Mrs. Carson have any money of her own?'

'No, not really,' Johnny replied.

'Then let me suggest that you have been the person who has been paying for this apartment. So arguably it’s your apartment.'

Managing through bluff and a little bribing to get the building manager to let them into the apartment, the team realized on entering that the apartment was filled with furniture discarded from Joanne and Carson's luxury UN Plaza Apartment.

This was before 1972 when Carson and 'The Tonight Show' made the decision to relocate to Burbank, California.

Having gained entry to the apartment that Copeland was leasing without her husband's knowledge, Carson and Bushkin discovered 'six or seven framed photographs' and the 'Tonight Show' stalwart did not take the news well.

'Carson leaned against the living room wall and began to weep,' writes Bushkin in his memoir.

'I could see that Carson's raincoat had fallen open. I was shocked to see that Johnny was carrying a .38 revolver in a holster on his hip.'

'Here’s Johneeeeee…..' I realized,' Bushkin writes, 'that I was probably one of the very few people who ever saw Johnny Carson cry.'

'Across the room, the silent Joe Mullen deftly swept some lingerie under the sofa with the toe of his shoe. He wanted to spare Johnny the sight. There was little else that could be done.'

'Joanne has broken my heart,' Carson told Bushkin, 'to the extent I ever had one.'

Later that evening, Bushkin says that a drunk Carson phoned him at 2 a.m. and basically demanded his presence at Manhattan's infamous Jilly's where he was drinking away his sorrows.

The bar was frequented by the famous and the infamous, especially a criminal element and Frank Sinatra had once quipped upon entering, 'Jesus, there must be forty-two indictments sitting at the bar.'

'I get drunk every night and I chase all the p***y I can get,' Carson said, in Bushkin's recollection at the bar.

'I'm sh***y in the marriage department. Make sure you understand this.

'He shot me a smile and said, “Henry, did you know that it’s a proven fact that married men live longer than single guys?

'It’s also  a proven fact that married men are far more willing to die.'

Indeed, because he was Johnny Carson, he simply couldn't resist a huge dig at his wife and his cuckold.

'Why Frank Gifford? What's that as***le got that I don't have? That guy plays three positions on the field.

'I could never get Joanne to go for more than two.'

Bushkin's book, notes that when Carson eventually dragged himself away from the bar he left with another woman who was 'as nearly famous' as he was and the next morning quizzed him about any indiscreet revelations he may have made when drunk.

The young attorney claims he saved his new boss' blushes and that Carson immediately quipped: 'Well, Henry, I guess you’re my lawyer now. Can you come over this 
afternoon? I want you to file for divorce as soon as possible.'
