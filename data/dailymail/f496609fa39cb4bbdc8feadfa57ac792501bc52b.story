Fans of The Darling Buds of May can now follow in the footsteps of the loveable Larkin family – and possibly recreate Charley and Mariette’s idyllic country wedding.

The Kent farm where the hit television series was filmed in the early 1990s, kick-starting Catherine Zeta-Jones’ glittering career, has been transformed into holiday accommodation and a wedding venue.

The beauty spot near the villages of Bethersden and Pluckley provided the backdrop for the Larkins’ ‘perfick life’ and is now owned by Darling Buds of May fan Simon Coulson, who snapped up the property went it went on sale for £1.35m.

Mr Coulson spotted a chance to convert the farm buildings into a tourist and wedding destination after learning from its previous owners, the Holmes family, that show devotees had been making pilgrimages to the location where its stars brought the plots to life.

Previously known as Buss Farm, it has been renamed Darling Buds Farm as a tribute to its history, and the oasthouse seen in the title sequence has been given a makeover. 

The building at the heart of the farmyard can sleep eight people and has its own garden with decking for outdoor dining as enjoyed by Ma and Pa Larkin.

The old Cart Lodge can sleep up to four people, while Pop Larkin's Grade II listed farmhouse, which will sleep 10, is due to open soon.

The farm has a stream and ponds populated with ducks and geese, and is set in 35 acres and surrounded by open countryside.

Superfans of the show can head to nearby Pluckley and visit The Black Horse pub, which served as the setting for the fictional Hare and Hounds pub, or St Nicholas Church, another filming location.

Adapted from a novel by H.E. Bates, the British comedy-drama series showed life in 1950s Kent through the eyes of the endearing Larkin family.

At its head was Pop Larkin, played by David Jason, whose catchphrase was 'perfick', while Catherine Zeta-Jones starred as Marietta and became one of the UK’s most popular actresses before her Hollywood film career took off.
