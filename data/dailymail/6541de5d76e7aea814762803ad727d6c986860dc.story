A man driving with four children in the trunk of his car was pulled over after police spotted him driving with a stolen license plate.

When officers arrested William Trey Benton of Lancaster South Carolina on Saturday, the trunk of the car opened and three boys and one girl stepped out. The girl, who was the youngest child in the group, was 11.

None of the children were injured or forced into the car, said Captain Scott Grant with the Lancaster Police Department.

Benton, 33, was charged with child endangerment, driving under suspension, operating an uninsured motor vehicle and possession of stolen property.

Police noticed Benton driving his red Ford Crown Victoria in and out of parking spaces along the street when they pulled him over.

The license plate did not match the one assigned to the vehicle, according to the police report.

At least two of the children found the trunk were Benton's children, police said.

The car was filled with other passengers as well.

Benton told police the car belonged to his grandfather and that he had borrowed it to take the family to the city’s annual Christmas parade, the report states.

He also told police that he didn't have a license, but that his son had a learner's permit and that they planned to exchange seats once he got the car out of traffic.

Benton and the children all live at the same address, according to the report.

Benton told local news station WBTV on Monday that he is a ‘good, church-going guy who would never do anything to intentionally hurt his children.’

He said he was leaving the parade with more people than could fit into his car.

He said the stolen license plate issue has to do with a family argument, where he believes someone put the plate on the vehicle and then called the police to report it as retaliation.
