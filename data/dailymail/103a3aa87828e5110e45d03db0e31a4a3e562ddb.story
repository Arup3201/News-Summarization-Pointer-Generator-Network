A mother arrested over the death of her daughter who was found collapsed in her cot with a head injury told police she didn’t touch her 'baby girl', an inquest heard today.

Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe died on February 28, 2012, a day after she was rushed to hospital with a 'non-accidental' head injury.

Police arrested Summer’s mother Victoria Rogers, 27, stepfather Craig Sharp, 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, on suspicion of murder later that year because all three had looked after the toddler during the time she was injured.

The trio couldn't offer an explanation for the injuries or recall an accident that could have led to them and police eventually decided not to proceed with charges. 

Bradford Coroners Court today heard that Miss Rogers told police during an interview after her arrest that she didn't touch her daughter, and had given her a bottle at 5.30am before leaving for work.

Summer - who suffered a 'blunt force head injury' and 'bruising to the brain' that would have required a significant impact - was pronounced dead in the early hours of the following day.

Medical experts concluded the toddler received the fatal injuries close to the time she was found dying.

Speaking to police in September 2012, Miss Rogers, an ancillary nurse, said that as far as she was concerned Summer was 'fit and well' when she left the house.

'There’s nothing I want to say apart from I didn’t touch my baby girl, I gave her her bottle at 5.30am and I went to work,' she said.

Miss Rogers added: 'Somebody got Summer up after I gave her that bottle, and somebody hurt her.'

When asked if she did something to cause Summer’s injury after giving her the bottle, she replied 'I didn’t'.

The inquest heard that Summer had not been feeling well in the days leading up to her death and had vomited on several occasions while staying with her grandparents over the weekend.

After leaving her Dewsbury home at 5.45am on the day Summer was discovered injured, Miss Rogers left tyre garage manager Mr Sharp in charge. He then left for work at about 7.45am.

Miss Roger's mother, Susan Rogers, then turned up to look after Summer and yesterday the inquest was told she checked on the toddler every 10 minutes before realising something was wrong with her about 8.30am.

Miss Rogers, seen here with Summer, told the hearing 'there's nothing I want to say apart from I didn't hurt my baby girl', and claimed someone else had got her daughter up and had hurt her

The retired nurse found Summer was ‘not breathing and her head was floppy’. She immediately started CPR and phoned relatives for help.

When paramedics arrived at the house at 8.54am, Summer was not breathing but had a pulse. She was rushed to hospital but died early the next day.

Forensic pathologist Dr Mathew Lyall, who carried out a post mortem, said Summer suffered bleeding and swelling on the brain, and had bruises on her scalp – the classic ‘triad’  of injuries ‘strongly associated with non-accidental infantile head injuries’.

During her police interview Miss Rogers said she didn't have any concerns about Mr Sharp's ability to look after Summer.

The inquest had previously heard that Summer was a healthy and happy girl from a ‘loving family’.

A statement read out in court from James Ratcliffe, Summer’s grandfather, said: 'Summer was a lovely girl and she brought new meaning to our lives.'

The self-employed plumber added: 'She was a wonderful little girl and I loved her dearly.'

The inquest continues.
