Chris Gunter has no intention of appeasing Reading legend Phil Parkinson in the FA Cup – even if the Royals’ Twitter account cosied up to their former captain.

Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final draw set up a tie between Reading and Bradford, with the winner earning a semi-final clash at Wembley Stadium.

The match sees Parkinson - now in charge of Bradford - host the club at which he made over 300 appearances as a player, but one current Reading man was in no mood for sentiment.

Chris Gunter seemed unhappy at the sentiment of Reading's tweet on Monday night, replying with one word

Gunter tweeted 'no' to the official Reading Twitter account after their tweet about Phil Parkinson

The Royals' official Twitter account posted a tweet noting that the club would be represented at Wembley regardless of the result, sparking a simple but effective reply from defender Gunter, who simply said: 'no'. 

The move seemed to impress Reading supporters, who were glad to find that one of their defenders is intent on approaching the tie in serious fashion. 

The quarter-final matches of the FA Cup will take place on the weekend of March 7-8.
