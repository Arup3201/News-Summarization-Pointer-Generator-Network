A man who stepped into traffic and then set himself on fire in an apparent suicide attempt has been connected to a woman found dead in a Cleveland home, authorities said.

Hugo Ramos, who was in critical condition at a Cleveland hospital, is a homicide suspect in the death of a 25-year-old woman, Cleveland police said today. 

Her name and cause of death have not yet been released. Ramos, 28, told officers where her body could be found.

Murder suspect Hugo Ramos, 28, allegedly abandoned three children in this car by the side of an Ohio highway then walked into traffic before attempting to set himself on fire on Monday

Officers forced their way into a home shortly before 3pm and found the body.

Ramos pulled his car to the side of U.S. Route 20 in Lorain County, about 35 miles west of Cleveland, around 10.50am on Monday with three small children inside, the Ohio State Highway Patrol said. 

The children - aged seven, four and one - were not injured, Chronicle Online reported. At least one of them is believed to belong to Ramos, investigators said. 

Ramos then stepped in front of a large truck and was struck, authorities said. After that, he managed to get up and retrieve from his car a container filled with what authorities believe was gasoline.

Ramos swallowed some of the gas, poured the remainder on his clothes and set himself on fire as the children sat in the car, investigators said. 

A bystander rushed over and put out the fire. Ramos was flown to Mercy Allen Hospital in Oberlin  where he was under police guard on Tuesday.

Officials say 28-year-old Hugo Ramos got a container of gasoline from his car, swallowed some of it, poured the rest on his body and then set himself on fire
