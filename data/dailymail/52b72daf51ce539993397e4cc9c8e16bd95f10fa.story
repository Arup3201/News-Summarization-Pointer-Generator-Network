Former England boss Andy Flower will help Lancashire with their coaching after the departure of Peter Moores to be the Zimbabwean's replacement as national team leader. 

As part of a deal with the ECB Flower will act as a mentor to captain Glen Chapple, who is now also in charge of first team matters.

The opportunity arose to bring in Flower as part of his new role with the ECB, where he is now technical director of elite coaching, during which he is expected to work with all the counties.

Chapple, 40, is still a vital player for Lancashire and they are looking to support him as he moves towards coaching. 

Mike Watkinson, Lancashire cricket director, told the Manchester Evening News: ‘We thought it would be beneficial if Glen could tap in to some of Andy’s expertise in a mentoring role to help him with his additional leadership duties and some long-term planning so he can think about his transition from becoming a player to a coach if that’s what he decides to do.

Watkinson stressed that the bowler is not guaranteed to get the job long-term, but will be considered when the county consider their options at the end of the season.

‘How Glen continues to perform as a player and what happens during this season will have a bearing on that.

‘We know he is very keen to continue in a coaching role and I am sure he will be a strong candidate come the end of the season on the basis everything has gone according to plan and then we can take a view.

‘For now it’s all about stability and continuity for the players.’
