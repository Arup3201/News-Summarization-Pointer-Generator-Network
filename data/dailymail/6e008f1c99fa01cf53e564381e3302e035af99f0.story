The parents who took their terminally ill boy from his hospital bed and fled Britain were last night found in Spain, along with their son.

Police tracked down five-year-old Ashya King with his father Brett and mother Naghmeh to a hostel in southern Spain.

The parents were arrested and were last night in police custody, while Ashya was rushed to a specialist hospital in Malaga with a police guard for urgent medical treatment.

'Leave us in peace: Brett King and his terminally ill son Ashya, who was removed by his parents from hospital on Thursday, are seen in the video posted on YouTube  last night

His parents, who are Jehovah’s Witnesses, had taken Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on Thursday, after doctors told them he had only months to live.

Ashya had a brain tumour the  size of a tangerine removed last weekend – but the family had been told the cancer would return and would probably be inoperable.

He was left with very limited movement, unable to speak and dependent on a machine for food.

Hampshire Police broke the news of the parents’ arrest on Facebook, saying: ‘Ashya has been found. He is in Spain.

'Police are speaking to his mum and dad and we are waiting to hear on Ashya’s condition. This is all we know at this time, but he has been found. Thank you to everyone who has been incredible in helping us spread this appeal.’

Hampshire officers will be travelling to Malaga today to aid the investigation.

Within an hour of the arrest, Ashya’s oldest brother Naveed posted a video on YouTube showing his father explaining their actions.

Holding his son’s hand tenderly and touching  his fingers, Mr King, 51, insisted Ashya had been safe and well, saying:  ‘We were most disturbed today to find that his face was all over the internet and newspapers, and we have been labelled as kidnappers and putting his life at risk.’

He added: ‘Call off this ridiculous chase. We are not neglecting our son. He’s in perfectly good health.

‘My son’s smiling, he’s happy. We’re doing things as a family. We just want to be left in peace.’

Mr King said that he wanted  his son to have a special treatment called proton beam therapy, but had been told by doctors in Southampton that it was not available  on the NHS. ‘He’s very sick. I just want to get on with his treatment. And I’m not coming back  to England if I cannot give him the treatment I want.’

Earlier in the day, a European arrest warrant had been issued for Mr and Mrs King for neglecting Ashya’s medical needs. Armed Spanish police were waiting outside the couple’s Costa del Sol  holiday home, but they were apprehended after checking into a hostel called Esperanza in Benajarafe,  14 miles east of Malaga.

A police source said: ‘We were alerted after the couple checked into the hostel in Benajarafe. We arrested them in their bedroom.’

The couple are expected to be taken to Madrid today for an extradition hearing. The couple are expected to oppose extradition so they can argue at a new hearing they should be released on bail for humanitarian reasons. Ashya has been taken to the Hospital Materno-Infantil in Malaga which specialises in treating seriously ill children. Doctors there are liaising with the boy’s British medics, but Hampshire Police said it was too soon to say when he might come home.

Hiding place: The King family were tracked down at Hostel Esperanza in Benajarafe, 14 miles east of Malaga

Naveed was last night sleeping with his five other siblings at one  of the rooms at the hostel.

A source close to the case said: ‘The oldest boy has been left in charge of the other children. He is due to check out on Sunday.’

Mr King said he found out about alternative treatments for his son after going online. He said on the YouTube video: ‘I’ve come to find out through the internet. The long-term side effects for my son are secondary malignant cancers, so the radiation will cause more cancers.’

Children who receive radiotherapy have a far greater risk of side effects including damaged DNA, reduced IQ, infertility and limited growth development.

On the video Ashya is seen hooked up to a feeding machine. Mr King said: ‘There’s been a lot of talk about this machine – as you see it’s all plugged in, we have got loads  of these feeds here, we have iron supplements and we have Calpol.

‘As you can see that there is nothing wrong with him. He is very happy actually since we took him out of hospital. He has been smiling a lot more.’

Explaining more about the proton beam treatment, he added: ‘We asked the NHS if we could please  go to America, Switzerland or another country to get proton beam – but they said no.’ Mr King added he would sell his home to pay for the therapy, and had looked into getting treatment in Prague.

Family friend Inma Martinez Macias described the Kings as a ‘very law-abiding, family’, adding: ‘They love their children and they take very good care of them. If they were bad parents they wouldn’t have allowed their son to have operations in the first place.’
