It was the big news to hit the world of TOWIE on Wednesday when she finally decided to hang up her high heels and leave the show.

Lauren Goodger has decided to open up about her decision to leave the reality programme and claims it is not to find her fortune elsewhere, but because of her weight insecurities.

Goodger, 25, has revealed that she would feel so body conscious next to other slim cast-mates that she would want to hide parts of her body in front of the cameras.

Free from TOWIE: Lauren has opened up about her reasons to leave The Only Way Is Essex, revealing she had enough of feeling insecure about her body on screen

She admits working with her skinny co-stars didn't help her feelings of paranoia.

She told the Sunday Mirror: 'I felt under so much pressure. Most of the girls on TOWIE are quite skinny... Next to the others, I’d be panicking over whether my arms looked fat or how big I’d look if I was sitting down.

'I’d even beg producers to let me sit at a table so I could hide my legs underneath.'

Lauren is now looking forward to 'a break' after constantly struggling with her weight issues since rising to fame on the reality show.

Final scenes: She announced during the season six finale on Wednesday that she would be 'going away for a while'

Since being put in front of the public eye Goodger has been subjected to internet trolls who have targeted over her fluctuating weight.

And she's now had enough of crying her her body issues and being targeted for being on The Only Way Is Essex.

She now feels it's the right time to move on after putting herself through the ups and downs of being a TOWIE star.

Lauren is also feeling more body confident now she is a 'healthy size 12' but hopes to drop a bit of weight in the near future, admitting shed like to drop 'a stone and a half'.

Goodger is rumoured to be taking up a role on Dancing On Ice now that she is free from the ITV2 show but she is still remaining tight-lipped about any signings.

She told the newspaper that 'nothing's confirmed yet'.

But one thing she will shed light on is the fact she's writing a book, although it won't be an autobiography telling all on her life and will instead be a guide about her life - battling with her weight and her relationship problems.
