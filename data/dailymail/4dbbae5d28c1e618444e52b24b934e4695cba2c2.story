With its walls left to crumble, and ivy winding its way through grandiose halls and staircases, it's easy to imagine how Overstone Hall might have fallen into disrepair because of a lack of funds for its upkeep.

However, the Northamptonshire stately home's troubles run far deeper than that.

Right from its first owner - Lord Overstone - it has been a resolutely unloved place and, since a fire ravaged the upper floors a decade ago, it has been up for sale for a mere £1million but without any interest.

Overstone Hall in Northamptonshire was hated by Lord Overstone whose wife commissioned the vast property in 1860 and has never been wanted by any of its owners

The stately home boasts  114 rooms, occupying 20,000sq ft and sits on 50 acres of country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire

The 19th century stately home boasts 114 rooms in 50 acres of  country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire.

Lady Overstone commissioned the  Elizabethan and Renaissance  style building in 1860, but didn't live to see it finished.

Unfortunately her husband Lord Overstone hated the design, built by architect William Milford Teulon, and even declared his contempt in a letter to friends.

'The new house, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation,' wrote Lord Overstone.

'It is an utter failure, although very large and full of pretension - it has neither taste, comfort nor convenience. I am utterly ashamed of it.'

Lord Overstone despised it so much that he refused to live in it for the remainder of his life, leaving it to his daughter Lady Wantage on his death in 1883.

Sir Philip Stott who wanted to turn it into a training base for the Conservative Party disliked the imposing building and condemned his scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928, before it was sold to the Charlotte Mason Schools Company

The mansion has now fallen into disrepair and has been reclaimed by nature with ivy and foliage growing through all the rooms in the house

A fire ripped through the top floor destroying 60 per cent of the property in April 2001, including all of the principal rooms and the impressive carved staircase

Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties, so it was sold in 1920 

In 1979 the school closed and was sold privately for £701,000 and used by the New Testament Church of God as its UK headquarters

Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties.

After she died in 1920, the property was sold to Sir Philip Stott who intended to use it as a training base for Conservative party members.

However he condemned the scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928.

It was privately sold to Charlotte Mason Schools Company in 1929 where part of the massive building was run as a girls' boarding school.

Lord Overstone hated the house so much that he refused to live there, saying: 'It is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation'

The property was listed in 2010 for £1million but the property didn't sell and is still owned by the New Testament Church of God, which is asking for the same price

Lord Overstone's daughter, Harriet, inherited the house after his death

Overstone Park was acquired by Lewis Loyd, father of Samuel Jones-Loyd, 1st Baron Overstone, for £117,500 in 1832.

On the death of Lewis Loyd in 1858, the house and 10,000 acres of land became Lord Overstone’s property.

The banker and politician had married Harriet, daughter of Conservative politician Ichabod Wright, in 1829.

Together they had one son, who died as an infant, and a daughter The Honourable Harriet Sarah Jones Loyd in 1829.

In 1860 Lady Overstone decided to engage the architect William Milford Teulon to replace the existing house with something more in keeping with their taste.

She was keen to have a property fitting with their status and so her husband decided to rebuild on a grand scale.

But she commissioned a design with a mixture of Elizabethan and Renaissance features which led to one of the most derided houses created in the Victorian era.

Lady Overstone died before the house was completed in November 1864 and left her husband a widower.

He hated the house and remarked in a letter to a friend: 'The New House, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated disappointment and vexation. It is an utter failure although very large and full of pretension, it has neither taste, comfort, nor convenience.'

He refused to live there in his later years and left the house and extensive fortune to his daughter Harriet on his death in 1883,

One of the most revered heiresses of her time, she was a noted philanthropist, and greatly interested in hospital and nursing work.

In November 1858 she married Robert James Lindsay, who assumed the name of Loyd-Lindsay by deed poll.

Early on, they became the owners of two fine country places - Overstone Park, Northampton, and Lockinge House, Wantage, where the couple chiefly resided.

She only used the Overstone estate occasionally for winter hunting parties, as her main home was in Oxfordshire.

With her husband, a former distinguished soldier and Victoria Cross hero, she was instrumental in establishing the National Aid Society, which was really the forerunner of the British Red Cross Society. 

Photographer Mathew Growcoot, 25, who entered the property described his experience as surreal and haunting, saying it has been reclaimed by nature

Photographer Mathew Growcoot, 25, who entered the property described his experience as surreal and haunting.

He said: 'I've never been to anywhere like it, it is such an enormous, imposing house that has been reclaimed by nature.

'I can understand why it was never wanted by any of its owners, the main tower looks distinctly unfriendly. It's hard to judge the interior because there's so little of it left but the few rooms that did remain were far too big and drafty.

'It was totally surreal being there and I did feel on edge because of the constants noises and flutterings, I actually had to remind myself that I don't believe in ghosts.'

The property was listed in 2010 for £1million but the property didn't sell and is still owned by the New Testament Church of God. 

A buyer is presently being sought.

The property is still owned by the New Testament Church of God and the organisation is hoping it will sell for more than £1million

Ivy and creepers have started growing through the windows and up the walls of the stately home in Northamptonshire since the fire in 2001
