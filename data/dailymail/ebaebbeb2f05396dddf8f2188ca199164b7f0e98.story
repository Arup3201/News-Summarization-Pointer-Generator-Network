In what was an extreme case of people power, workers and customers at a supermarket have come together to tackle and apprehend a would be robber, who threatened a staff member with a broken bottle.

Selina Bell, 16, was working at the cash register at the Carlisle IGA, in Perth's east, at 8.20pm Sunday night when she was approached by a man who was wearing a hoodie, in what went on to become a botched robbery.

CCTV footage shows the man, walk behind the counter, grabbing Ms Bell and holding a broken bottle to her stomach before demanding money.

Instantly a brave co-worker is seen rushing to her aid, putting his arm around the attacker and dragging him by the neck for metres out from the counter.

It's then another female worker gets involved in the struggle and tries to help by pulling the woman away from the man.

Incredibly the staff member is then seen trying to hold onto the man and grab his leg to stop him from fleeing before being flung to the ground.

In an extraordinary show of people power, a customer also comes to help and holds a trolley in the attackers way so he can't get away.

The footage then shows the thug is tackled to the ground where he is tied up, in a citizens type arrest, and kept in the back room of the store, before police arrive to take him into custody.

'It was really horrible, I was just thinking if he doesn't choke me to death, he's going to stab me,' Selina Bell told Sky News.

IGA worker Teressa Tai also told Sky News she was just trying to hold him down.

'Hold onto his leg so he couldn't move,' she said.

Incredibly a customer then joins in the fight, using a trolley to block off the man from getting away. The female staff member (pictured on floor) tries to grab his leg 

The 31 year old Balcatta man was tied down in a citizens style arrest before police arrived and took him into custody

The 31 year old from Balcatta was arrested but no charges have been laid as yet, with the man tacking a trip to the hospital.

Staff at the local IGA store have admitted the shop is regularly a target of thieves, one worker recounting how staff have been previously threatened with knives, syringes and machetes.
