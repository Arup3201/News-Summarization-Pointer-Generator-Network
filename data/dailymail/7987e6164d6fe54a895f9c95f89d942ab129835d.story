Federal police blocked access Friday 
to a central Mexico hospital where six people were reported to have been
 admitted with radiation exposure.

An
 official familiar with the case confirmed Mexican media reports that 
the six have been admitted to the general hospital in the city of 
Pachuca and may have been exposed to a stolen source of cobalt-60.

The
 official, who spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because she was 
not authorized to speak to the media, said only one person was dizzy and
 vomiting, which are symptoms of radiation poisoning.

Who did it? The container went missing on Tuesday while en route to a waste facility. It was recovered the next day, but opened which means that whoever opened is probably suffering from radiation poisoning

The atomic energy agency said the 
cobalt has an activity of 3,000 curries, or Category 1, meaning 'it 
would probably be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded 
radioactive material for a period in the range of a few minutes to an 
hour.'

The missing shipment of radioactive cobalt-60 was found 
Wednesday about 40 kilometers (24 miles) from where it had been stolen 
early Monday.

It's not clear if those hospitalized are responsible for the theft.

The cargo truck hauling the cobalt-60 was taken from a
 gas station in the central state of Hidalgo, where Pachuca is located. 
The material had been removed from obsolete radiation therapy equipment 
at a hospital in the northern city of Tijuana and was being transported 
to nuclear waste facility in the state of Mexico, which borders Mexico 
City.

The
 highly radioactive material was found in an empty parking lot about a 
kilometer from Hueypoxtla, a small farming town of about 4,000 people - 
close to where it was originally stolen.

Officials
 say the radioactive source had been removed from its container but say 
whoever had opened could die 'because the source's intensity is very 
high'.

'They will eventually have to go to a hospital, and we'll be waiting for them,' NNSC official Mardonio Jimenez said.

Cleaning up: The stolen container was found in a field in a rural town in central Mexico. Authorities are now working at containing the radioactive material

Cordoned off: Authorities are restricting access to the area surrounding the container so no one is accidentally exposed to the radioactive material

According to Juan Eibenschutz, 
director general of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and 
Safeguards, the shipment of Cobalt-60 was Category 1 meaning 'it would 
probably be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive 
material for a period in the range of a few minutes to an hour.'

Authorities
 are now in the process of containing the material in order to transport
 it to a waste site, which they estimate will take about two days.

'It's
 a very delicate operation. What's important is that the material has 
been located and the place is being watched to guarantee no one gets 
close,' Juan Eibenschutz, director of the National Commission of Nuclear
 Safety and Safeguards, told the Associated Press.

The container was discovered by a family, who were promptly put under medical observation, but according to Hueypoxtla's mayor, Javier Santillan, they suffered no harm.

The truck marked 'Transportes Ortiz' left Tijuana on November 28 and was on its way to a nuclear waste facility when the driver stopped to rest at a gas station in Tepojaco, in Hidalgo state north of Mexico City.

The driver, Valentin Escamilla Ortiz, told authorities he was sleeping in the truck when two men with a gun approached about 1:30am Tuesday. They made him get out, tied his hands and feet and left him in a vacant lot nearby.

When he was able to free himself, he ran back to the gas station to get help.

Police and military quickly joined the hunt to find the missing cobalt-60 because it could be used by terrorists to create a 'dirty bomb'.

But authorities don't believe that the thieves who stole the truck did it to intentionally steal the cobalt-60.

Eibenschutz said that the thieves were mostly likely after the white 2007 Volkswagon cargo vehicle.

On average, a half dozen thefts of radioactive materials are reported in Mexico each year and none have proven to be aimed at the cargo, Eibenschutz said. He said that in all the cases the thieves were after shipping containers or the vehicles.

Unintentional thefts of radioactive materials are not uncommon, said an official familiar with cases reported by International Atomic Energy Agency member states, who was not authorized to comment on the case. In some cases, radioactive sources have ended up being sold as scrap, causing serious harm to people who unknowingly come into contact with it.

In a Mexican case in the 1970s, one thief died and the other was injured when they opened a container holding radioactive material, he said.

The container was junked and sold to a foundry, where it contaminated some steel reinforcement bars made there. Eibenschutz said all foundries in Mexico now have equipment to detect radioactive material.

On the lookout: Mexican authorities scrambled Wednesday to find a truck containing 'extremely dangerous' radioactive material used in medical treatment. The truck and its contents have now been found seperately
