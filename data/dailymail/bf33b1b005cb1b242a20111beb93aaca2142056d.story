Speaking about why she liked to photograph older subjects, she explained: 'They teach you the marks of life.

'If you observe them for long enough, you end up discovering interesting people.'

Benidorm has recently become the less-than-flattering star of the comedy TV series of the same name, which focuses on the older population of the popular resort town

The former psychologist told MailOnline: 'There are women who really dress up, who look very beautiful, but above all, I like that they lose their inhibitions here.

'They look happy.' 

She added: 'This last year, I have dedicated myself 100 per cent to photography and I hope to continue this way.

'Next month I have an exhibition of a series called Gammacity, with urban photos I've taken.

'These beach shots form a series called Radioactive Life.

'In this area where I live now, there is a large population of older people - many retirees.

'That's why I photograph them.'

Spain's Costa Blanca, home to Benidorm and a string of other seaside resorts, first became popular with Britons in 1957 with the dawn of the package holiday.

It boomed in the 1960s, but then experienced a decline for a decade after tour operator Court Line went bust stranding tens of thousands of people abroad. 

In peak holiday season, expat residents mingle with holidaymakers on the busy beaches

Moldes says that her favourite part of her hobby is seeing how the women who 'lose their inhibitions here'

But Benidorm picked up again following the death of General Franco in 1974, which prompted a boom in Spain as it opened up to tourism and international business.

Benidorm's reputation has suffered in recent years and has even become the subject of the television comedy series of the same name that paints it in a less-than-flattering light.

However, with new luxury hotels being built and low property prices, the seaside town is hoping to boom once again.
