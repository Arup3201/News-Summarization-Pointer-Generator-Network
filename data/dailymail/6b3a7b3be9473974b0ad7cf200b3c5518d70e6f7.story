Two weeks passed before they found Douglas Gissendaner - still slumped forward, as he had died, on his knees in a remote patch of Georgia woodland.

He had been bludgeoned and stabbed up to ten times in the neck. His fallen glasses were smeared with grime and his body had been picked at by animals.

In its own twisted way, it had been a crime of passion. Douglas's wife, Kelly, had convinced her boyfriend that he had to prove his love by killing the man she said stood in their way.

It's difficult to imagine a more cold-blooded means for a wife to have her husband dispatched, and next Monday, Kelly Gissendaner will pay the ultimate price for her sins.

The first woman to be executed in Georgia since 1945, she has languished on Death Row for 17 years, the only female. Lack of exercise and a prison diet put paid to the pretty face and slim figure that once drew men to her.

Gissendaner, who is 46, has already chosen a last meal of cornbread, two cheese burgers, two large portions of chips, cherry vanilla ice-cream, popcorn, salad with buttermilk and lemonade to wash it all down.

That is just one of the rituals for condemned prisoners on their final day. There is a last meeting with loved ones and supporters, a talk with a spiritual adviser and the preparation of the last words.

Then, finally, watched through a glass window by a small group of the victim's relatives and local media witnesses, she will be strapped to a stretcher in a small execution chamber.

At that point, she will be allowed to deliver a few sentences before she is injected with a cocktail of chemicals designed to put her to sleep painlessly and then stop her heart.

There is, however, no guarantee the process will go smoothly, given recent scandals over injections which left Death Row prisoners in agony for prolonged periods before they died.

What makes this execution the subject of such fascination, however, is the fact it is a woman who is being legally killed.

Inevitably, executing female prisoners poses unique ethical quandaries. Experts say juries are often reluctant to send women to Death Row.

One in ten suspects arrested for murder in America are women, but only one in 50 of those given death sentences and just one in 100 of the prisoners who are eventually executed is female.

Equally, there is a counter-argument that in the most heinous murder cases, the jurors can feel such disgust at a woman's involvement that their gender can work against them. That appears to have been so at Kelly Gissendaner's trial.

Another twist in the case has deeply troubled legal experts. For while the mother-of-three was sentenced to death, her former lover Gregory Owen - the man who actually carried out the killing - escaped with a life sentence that could see him out of prison less than ten years from now.

After accepting a controversial plea deal to testify against his partner in crime, Owen admitted his guilt and helped prosecutors portray Gissendaner as the case's Lady Macbeth - with her suggesting the murder, planning it and urging him to do it. He might have been 'the bullet', as the lead prosecutor liked to phrase it, but she was 'the gun'.

Broken family: Kelly's  three children (two pictured) - now grown up - were fathered by different men of whom Douglas was one

The court heard how Kelly was born to a poor cotton farmer father and a mother who now works as a prison officer, and was sexually abused as a child by a string of men.

They included an uncle and even her stepfather, who slept with the then ten-year-old girl for six months under the pretence of helping her get used to a new bed. When she grew up and married Douglas Gissendaner, their relationship was a rocky one.

Between 1989 and 1996 they married, divorced, remarried, separated and reunited. Her three children, now grown up, were fathered by different men — one of whom was Douglas.

Both Gissendaners spent periods in the U.S. Army, and Kelly even worked briefly as a prison officer.

They moved to Auburn, Georgia, in December 1996. But Douglas didn't know that his wife had found a boyfriend — Gregory Owen — while they had been separated. She rekindled that relationship after she returned to Douglas.

Owen said he had suggested she divorce Douglas, but she insisted her husband would never leave her alone. She also appears to have anticipated a decent pay-out from his life insurance policy. So it was that she hatched a plot to be rid of him.

One evening in February 1997, Kelly drove Gregory Owen to her home and gave him a truncheon and a large hunting knife. She left him inside, waiting for her husband to return, while she went off to dance at a local bar.

Douglas, who had spent the evening helping friends from their local church repair their car, got back at 11.30pm. Owen surprised him and drove him - at knifepoint - to a remote wooded area, before walking him deep among the trees and ordering him to kneel down.

First removing his victim's watch and wedding ring - to make it look like a robbery - he knocked Douglas out with a blow from the truncheon and then stabbed him repeatedly.

Kelly arrived at the woods while the killing was in progress and, afterwards, helped set fire to Owen's car to destroy any forensic evidence.

The following morning, she raised the alarm over her missing husband, even playing the worried wife in TV appeals. By the time police found the body, she had discovered to her fury that his life insurance policy was worth only around £6,000.

Following the murder, police and friends were struck by Kelly's apparent lack of emotion, but her biggest mistake had been telling friends she had a boyfriend.

Police discovered Owen's connection to her and arrested the pair two days after the funeral. Both were told they faced the death penalty unless they accepted a plea deal - testifying against each other in return for a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years.

Gissendaner refused, but Owen agreed, and a jury convicted her of murder with malice in 1998.

Statistics show that Gissen- daner's case is almost unique in America's grim history of capital punishment. For example, of the 1,402 murderers executed since the Seventies, only five were conspirators (rather than the actual killer).

Though she is desperate to live, there is no doubt Gissendaner has faced a miserable existence for a long time. As the only woman on Death Row in her state, she has lived in complete segregation from other inmates in a women's prison outside Atlanta.

She spends 15 hours a day in a 9ft by 12ft cell with a six-by-nine-inch window. Her meals are slid through a hatch three times a day, and whenever she needs to leave her room, even to have a shower, she is handcuffed.

'I deserve to be here, but I don't deserve to die,' she said ten years ago. 'How can you justify me being here when [her former boyfriend Gregory Owen] could be walking the streets one day?'

In previous clemency applications, clergymen and prison officials described her as a changed woman, a 'truly redeemed person' who had genuinely found God. Even her children said they have forgiven her and wanted her life spared.

The same people made last- ditch pleas to the state's board of pardons and parole at a hearing on Tuesday, with officials saying that Gissendaner had now become a committed Christian.

Although not present at the hearing, she said in a statement: 'There are no excuses for what I did. I will never understand how I let myself fall into such evil.'

However, with the victim's family joining prosecutors in opposing clemency, calls to halt the execution have fallen on deaf ears.

In truth, she always had little chance in such a hardline state: in January, Georgia executed a decorated Vietnam veteran for murdering a policeman, despite evidence he had been affected by post-traumatic stress disorder. The next execution was of a man with an IQ of only 70.

Yesterday morning, the parole board ruled that Gissendaner should indeed be executed.

She will be moved from her women's prison to a men's facility, the Georgia Diagnostic And Classification State Prison, 114 miles away, where she is to be put to death in its small execution block.

There seems little doubt of her guilt, even if her punishment raises many questions.

The last woman to be executed in Georgia, 70 years ago - in an age of open racial prejudice - was a black maid named Lena Baker who killed her employer.

She claimed he had tried to imprison her, and she had acted in self-defence.

Nine years ago, the same pardons and parole board which heard Gissendaner's final appeal gave Baker a full posthumous pardon.

But for the woman who ordered her husband to be slaughtered like an animal in the woods, there is to be no mercy.
