The daughter of University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban has claimed she acted in self defence against a 'drunken sorority sister' when the two women brawled after a night of partying in 2010 over a Facebook post.

Court documents have revealed that Kristen Saban described former best friend Sarah Grimes as the aggressor even though it was Grimes who sued Saban over the altercation.

But Grimes' attorney, Stephen 
Strickland, said Kristen 
Saban punched Grimes 'like Boom Boom Mancini', 
referring to the professional boxer.

Sister, sister: The Phi Mu house at the University of Alabama; both girls pledged the sorority in 2009

He added: 'She had the devil beat out of her.'

Both women were members of Phi Mu sorority at Alabama but graduated last year.

Neither
 woman was in court during the hearing, in which Grimes' lawyer filed 
copies of their sworn testimony in pleadings before Tuscaloosa County 
Circuit Judge James H. Roberts Jr.

Grimes claims Saban started a fight that left her need nose surgery and suffering a concussion.

But the coach's daughter paints a picture of Grimes being out of control and angry the night they clashed.

Kristen
 Saban told lawyers that she, Grimes and other friends were at Saban's 
apartment after several hours of drinking, and everyone was intoxicated.

She said she 
retreated into her room upset after Grimes told her to stop being 
'pathetic' about her relationship with a boyfriend.

She claims that Grimes began beating on her door after she posted 'No one likes Sarah, yay' on Facebook.

She said the confrontation turned physical after Saban opened the door.

Whereas
 Grimes said the other woman pushed her first, Kristen Saban testified 
that Grimes initially grabbed her around the neck.

The
 two pulled hair and tussled in a fight that was 'a lot of slapping and 
punching, not many landing, and scratching,' Saban testified.After the fight, Kristen Saban said she was crying on the floor beside her bed when Grimes came into the room and straddled her.

'She
 told me to look at her, because I had my hands over my eyes crying. She
 said, 'We can't do this to each other. We're best friends,' Saban said.

'And then what happened?' asked a lawyer, according to a transcript of the testimony.

'I
 said, "You came at my throat. You came at my throat." And she said, "We
 can't do this, we need to talk about this, but I need to go to the 
hospital to document this,'" Kristen Saban said.

Grimes
 filed suit against Kristen Saban in 2012 seeking an unspecified amount 
of money for the fight. Neither Nick Saban nor wife Terry Saban is 
directly involved in the case.

Before
 the fight, documents show, Grimes and Saban had been at odds because 
the coach's daughter didn't invite Grimes to a workout in the Crimson 
Tide football facility or the premiere of a movie about the coach. Talks
 involving the coach's wife after the fracas failed to avert a suit, 
records show.
