A near collision between a passenger plane and an unregistered drone at Perth Airport has left investigators baffled, it emerged today.

The Australian Transport and Safety Bureau released a statement confirming that they were unable to identify the operator of the craft nor any details about the object.

The incident happened on March 19 and involved a Skippers Aviation De Havilland DHC-8 which was at 3,800 ft above sea level and preparing to land when the crew spotted a bright strobe light directly in the plane's path.

The pilot of a Skippers Aviation De Havilland DHC-8 plane was forced to swerve when an unidentified object believed to be a drone, was spotted directly in front of the plane on March 19

The plane was flying at 3,800 ft above sea level towards Perth at the time of the incident, despite regulations requiring drones to fly  below 400 feet

The pilot swerved, missing the object by about 20 metres horizontally and 100 feet vertically, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a report released on Monday.

Crew believed that the light was attached to an unmanned aerial vehicle and the pilot described it as cylindrical in shape and grey in colour.

As the airspace below 3,500 feet was military restricted airspace, the ATSB also spoke to the Australian Defence Force who confirmed it was not operating drones and was not aware of any operations at the time of the incident, which happened at 9.13am.

The incident was followed by another three days later when the Westpac rescue chopper, carrying five crew, took off from Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital.

A white light was spotted coming from a drone hovering 1,000 feet above Hunter stadium where a football match was underway.

The incident has come during a time of increasing complaints about the poorly regulated drones, which can be easily bought online

The unmanned craft began to move directly toward the helicopter, requiring the pilot to take evasive action.

The ATSB could not find the operators of the drone.

'These people might just be having some fun ... but they are breaking the rules,' investigations manager Neville McMartin said.

Regulations set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, state that unmanned aerial vehicles must operate below 400 feet and at least 5 kilometres away from any airport.

The incidents have come at a time when authorities are noticing an increase in incidents involving unmanned aircraft.

ASA said the majority of complaints about drones relate to 'first person view' aircraft, which have a fixed video and are controlled by a person on the ground watching a live feed.

The ATSB received its first report about an unmanned craft in October 2012 when operators lost control of an airship which drifted into the exclusion zone of Moorabbin Airport.

In September 2013 a drone conducting aerial photography in regional Victoria came close to colliding with an agricultural plane.

'You can buy these things online and have them delivered to your home,'Mr McMartin said.

'These reports are a sign of things to come. There are a whole lot of issues we have to work through.'

Commercial drone operators are required to be licensed by CASA.
