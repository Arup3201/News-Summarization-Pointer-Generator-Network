A sporty schoolgirl who suffered torment at the hand of bullies has landed modelling contracts with, not one, but three top agencies.

Jasmine Gorman, 12, from Garswood, Merseyside, was a member of Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust excellence swimming squad and a former member of Liverpool Harriers running team.

But she was forced to change schools after being repeatedly taunted for her slim figure and branded ‘anorexic’ by fellow pupils.

But now, pretty Jasmine is having the last laugh. Modelling agencies Bizzykidz, Adora Models and Talent Management all couldn’t wait to sign her up.

Jasmine will also be appearing in the Grand Final of Miss Junior Teen Great Britain competition in August.

Her mother Rachel, 43, said: ‘Jasmine used to get called all sorts of names such as anorexic because she is tiny, due to exercising five times a week because of her commitment to sport.

‘She was bullied a lot last year and she ended up having to change schools. It was such a difficult time for her.’

But Rachel is convinced that modelling will help Jasmine regain her confidence and boost her self-esteem.

‘The main aim of this competition is to give Jasmine lots more confidence and I think it's working,’ she said.

‘She is still quiet and a bit timid but the modelling is really helping her to come out of her shell and do things which she would never have done before.

‘Now she has something to concentrate on and show the bullies what she is really made of.’

This isn't the first time Jasmine has been talent-spotted: When she was just eight years old she was asked to take part in modelling work, though Rachel insists that she will ensure Jasmine keeps her feet on the ground and lives her adolescence to the maximum.

She added: ‘I don't want her to get too involved with fake tanning and overdoing the make-up as I don't think any girl needs at that age needs to wear it.

‘She is such a natural beauty, a very pretty girl, and is really good at modelling. I can’t wait to see her up on that stage.

‘She's just really excited for the final now. And I couldn't be more proud. I actually think I'm more nervous than her!’

Jasmine says she is passionate about pursuing a career in either catwalk modelling, acting or physiotherapy.
