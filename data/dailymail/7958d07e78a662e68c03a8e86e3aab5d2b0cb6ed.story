A 15-year-old described by a neighbour as a 'nice young boy' walked into a police station in rural Arkansas and told officers he had shot and killed his sister at home.

Franklin County prosecutor David Gibbons says he plans to 
charge the boy as an adult 'because of the nature of the crime' and a judge set his bail at $750,000.

The boy
 hasn't been identified because of his age, and his court hearing was 
closed to the public. The judge even forced the boy's aunt and uncle out
 of the courtroom, leaving the boy to stand alone before the judge, 
Gibbons said. He was appointed a public defender, and his next court 
date is March 1.

Horror: A 15-year-old walked into a police station near his home in Ozark, Arkansas (pictured), and told officers he had shot and killed his sister at home

Police found the 16-year-old girl's 
body in a bedroom of the house near Ozark while the teens' parents were 
out grocery shopping, Franklin County Sheriff Anthony Boen said last 
night.

Sheriff Boen said he
 did not believe the girl's death was accidental, although her brother 
appeared remorseful and had tears in his eyes when he turned himself in.

Authorities are treating the death as a homicide.

Sheriff Boen said: 'He just said that he had just shot and killed his sister. He didn't give a motive.'

The boy was in custody in nearby Sebastian County because Franklin County is not set up to house juveniles. He is expected to appear before a judge later today, although no charges have been filed yet.

The teen is thought to have killed his sister sometime after 8am on Sunday, when his parents left to go grocery shopping in Fort Smith, about 40miles away.

He turned himself in at the sheriff's department about an hour and a half later.

Deputies had never been called to the home before and there weren't any reports of trouble with the teens, Sheriff Boen said.

A neighbour described the family as 'nice and quiet' and the boy as a 'nice young boy'.

Donna Sheppard, who lives next to the family's home, said her grandson knew the boy from school.

She said: 'It's the most shocking thing I could have ever imagined.'

Mrs Sheppard said she did not hear any gunshots before she left for Sunday school a little after 9am, and learned about the shooting when she came home from church that afternoon.

The girl's body has been sent to the state crime lab, and preliminary autopsy results are expected sometime this week.

Investigators confiscated multiple guns from the family's home and vehicle and were trying to determine which weapon had been used in the shooting.

Sheriff Boen said: 'Both the dad and the son were avid hunters.'

The Arkansas State Police are investigating the case, but spokesman Bill Sadler refused to comment.
