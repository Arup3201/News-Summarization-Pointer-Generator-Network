Criticism: Author Joanna Trollope has blamed such screen adaptations of Jane Austen's work for criticism of her own latest novel

Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in a wet white shirt is a scene many Jane Austen fans recall fondly.

But therein lies the problem, novelist Joanne Trollope claimed yesterday.

The best-selling writer, who has faced a backlash from ‘Jane-ites’ following the release of her modern day version of Sense and Sensibility, said many of her critics would have found it ‘very difficult’ to read Austen’s original work and will be basing their opinions on TV adaptations.

Citing the example of Colin Firth playing Mr Darcy in the TV adaptation, she said: ‘They [Jane Austen] fans love Pride and Prejudice when Colin Firth emerges from the lake in the wet shirt, which at no point features in the book. I’m not saying there isn’t great accuracy in the films but it isn’t the same.’

Miss Trollope, 69, was making her comments at London book club Hidden Prologues  where she explained how she had adapted the classic, Sense and Sensibility published in 1811, by setting it in modern day society.

The author told how she chose to reference social networking site YouTube and used colloquialisms such as ‘totes amaze-balls’ from ITV2 reality-soap The Only Way is Essex to bring it into 2013.

The mother-of-two said many of the Austen themes were transferable to the 21st Century claiming many women are still driven by the sex appeal of money.

Miss Trollope went on to joke that nobody ever had slept with Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone for his looks or that Fifty Shades of Grey character Christian Grey would not be as desirable if he was not as wealthy.

Miss Trollope has written more than 30 novels but is best-known for her historical romance ‘The Rector’s Wife’.

She said: ‘The one thing which Jane Austen understood was the sex appeal of money, and that’s a recurrence today. Do you really think anyone went to bed with Bernie Ecclestone for his good looks?

‘Fifty Shades of Grey would not have been an erotic best seller if Christian Grey had had no money. If that novel had been set in a bedsit above a take-away in suburban London it would have been a novel about sexual abuse and that is why it works.’

Defending her right to play around with the original Miss Trollope yesterday argued many fans found it ‘very difficult’ to read Austen and were more likely to watch the films.

Miss Trollope’s Sense and Sensibility was released in October and she said: ‘People have to remember that I’m not writing a sequel. The problem we have is, there is a generation who claim to absolutely love her – they think they are Jane Austen fans but actually they know every frame of the films and the television.

‘The funny thing is people find Georgian English very hard to read, therefore most ‘fans’ seek adaptations.

‘‘When I was writing I took a paperback and I cannibalised it, I went through with a highlighter pen and looked to see which dialogue I wanted to use.

‘And I managed to translate Austen to ‘totes amazeballs’ and if you sit and watch The Only Way Is Essex the language is great so I had to have a play.’

Sense and Sensibility was first adapted for television in 1981in a serial directed by Rodney Bennett then in 1995 it was made into film starring actress Emma Thompson.

Most recently in 2008 the novel was once again adapted for television as part of an Austen series run by the BBC.

Yesterday the romantic writer criticised devote ‘Janeities’ claiming their tributes to her are not in the spirit of Austen.

The grandmother branded the Austen legacy as ‘Quality Street’ and argued it was wrong to ‘sanctify’ her.

Miss Trollope, who is twice divorced and lives alone in London, added: ‘Janeites aren’t really in the spirit of Jane Austen.  

‘I think she may have looked at ‘Jane Austen Day’ and gone – no god why.

‘There’s a slightly quality street element to what has become the Jane Austen legacy.

‘If you read her letters they are such fun, she’s mad about clothes and what everything costs and what we are going to have for dinner –They are full of parties and gossip.

‘She was a hugely intelligent women but she was very much of her time. She had a perfectly feminine appreciation of all the pleasures women would share.

‘To sanctify her and to make her separate her – to almond sugar coat her – is not doing her justice.’
