Prince Charles (pictured wearing traditional uniform in Saudi Arabia last year) said he is alarmed at the number of young Britons radicalised online

Prince Charles says it is a 'great worry' that so many young Britons who are yearning for adventure and excitement are being radicalised by 'crazy stuff' online.

The heir to the throne partly blamed the growing number of Islamic fanatics in the UK on a desire to 'want to take risks' but added that the most 'frightening part' was the role of the internet.

His comments, in which he also urged young jihadists to show more respect to 'the values we hold dear', were broadcast in an interview with BBC Radio 2's The Sunday Hour, at the start of his six-day tour of the Middle East.

He said: 'The radicalisation of people in Britain is a great worry, and the extent to which this is happening is alarming, particularly in a country like ours where we hold values dear.

'You would think the people who have come here, or are born here, and go to school here, would abide by those values and outlooks.'

He added: 'But the frightening part is that people can be so radicalised, either through direct contact with somebody, or through the internet.

'There is an extraordinary amount of crazy stuff on the internet and clearly some people get particularly affected by it and join with others.

'I can see some of this radicalisation is a search for adventure and excitement at a particular age.' 

The prince added that he had been working with the Prince's Trust and other groups to try and find alternatives for those who are prone to radicalisation.

He said he had been working in deprived, Muslim areas of the UK and had found 'interesting examples' of people who have been deradicalised after being 'horrified' by what they have learned.

The prince also touched on the difficulty of preventing radicalisation, saying you cannot 'just sweep it under the carpet', but instead have to remind people of 'the distortions that are made of great religions'. 

He said: 'How you prevent radicalisation in the first place is the great challenge. You cannot just sweep it under the carpet. But the most important thing is to remind people of the distortions that are made of great religions, and the original ideas of the founders of these religions.

'Often you find their message is so distorted by their putative followers. That's the tragedy and, of course, traditional Islam does not permit this sort of thing.'  

During the interview, he also launched a staunch defence of the 'Christian standpoint', killing off speculation that he will take up the multicultural 'defender of the faith title' when he becomes king.

Experts believe there are now thousands of young Britons fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the majority of whom are said to have been radicalised online.  

The prince's comments on Islam and Christianity were broadcast in an interview with BBC Radio 2's The Sunday Hour with Diane Louise Jordan this morning

Among those who have made it to Iraq and Syria - usually through the porous Turkish border - are a Cardiff trio, who appeared on a jihad recruitment video last year.

The three school friends – gap-year student Nasser Muthana, 20, his brother Aseel, 17, and their friend Reyaad Khan, 20 – were said to have jetted-in on a tourist fight to Antalya, in southern Turkey, after paying for a one-week stay at a five-star spa resort.

They then crossed over from Turkey, via the so-called 'Gateway to Jihad' or 'Jihad Express'.

In July last year, Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, also ran away from home to travel to Syria, where they married fighters.

The pair - who have since earned the sobriquet the 'terror twins' - had 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college. They were said to have been radicalised over the internet. 

The comments came at the start of his six-day Middle East tour, which began in Jordan  (pictured)

Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra had travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success.

In December, it was also reported that 20-year-old Muslim convert Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, also known by a second nom de guerre of Abu Abdullah al-Britani, had been killed in action.

Al-Habashi, from north London, was of Eritrean origin and converted from Christianity to Islam during his teenage years. He is understood to have travelled from the UK to join the Islamic State in Syria in December 2013. 

Al-Habashi was a well known and popular figure in Islamic State due to his media appearances. In August, he was interviewed on BBC Newsnight, where he admitted that his family had been trying to persuade him to return home but he had insisted there was 'no going back.' 

Days later, there were also claims that Abu Dharda, 20, also known as Abu Dhar Somali, was killed fighting alongside militants in the border town of Kobane.

Abu Dharda, from west London, came from a British-Somali background and travelled to Syria via Turkey in the same month as al-Habashi.

Another radicalised Briton said to have been killed in action is Ali Kalantar, 19, from Coventry, who was allegedly 'brainwashed' to fight overseas by a local imam in less than one month.

The teenager - who had previously wanted to be a model - left the UK in March last year while studying for his A-levels. He left alongside two friends, including 18-year-old Mohammed Hadi, who has since been dubbed Osama Bin Bieber due to his youthful looks. 

Last year, Kalantar's father, who is of Afghan origin, described how he believed his son had been radicalised by an imam at a small mosque who sent him 'down this road'.

Rahim Kalantar told the BBC that he worried about his son 'every minute' and that his grief is 'limitless'.

On his Facebook page, Kalantar had also described how he had no intention of returning to the UK, despite members of his family travelling to Turkey to try and find him.

Meanwhile, Mohammed Hadi's mother believes her son had no means of paying for transport to the Syrian border with his £14 per week pocket money and that religious leaders may have funded his journey.

Other radicialised Britons include Glaswegian public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20 - who was reported missing by her parents  before surfacing in Syria in February last year -  and Khadijah Dare, 22, who arranged to marry an Islamic State fighter via Facebook and moved to Syria in 2012. She has previously posted photographs online of her son holding an AK-47.
