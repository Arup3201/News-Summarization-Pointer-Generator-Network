After a relaxing break at the Duchess' family home in sleepy Berkshire, the Royal couple's pace of life picked up considerably this morning after the Duchess went into labour.

The Duke of Cambridge and his wife drove from their home in Kensington Palace without a police escort and Kate was tended to by doctors at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London about 6am this morning.

The Duke of Cambridge was at his wife's side in hospital today after she went into labour, three days after the couple returned to London from their countryside retreat.

Her last official engagement came last month when she joined other members of the Royal Family at the Trooping the Colour ceremony.

Since then, she has been relaxing with 
William and her parents, in an attempt to escape the oppressive heat of 
the city during the recent period of unusually high temperatures.

The Duke, who has temporarily been off duty from his role as an RAF rescue pilot, will take two weeks of paternity leave after the birth.

Kate went into labour shortly before 6am today, and was rushed to the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where William was born in 1982.

The birth of the Royal baby boy, who will one day become the monarch, was via a traditional easel set up outside Buckingham Palace.

The couple were apparently seen leaving the Middletons' £4.8million Georgian home in a Range Rover on Friday afternoon, with William at the wheel.

Their car was also accompanied by a police escort and several plain-clothed Scotland Yard bodyguards, with an armed response unit posted outside the house.

The Duchess plans to return to her parents' home at some point in the next few weeks in order to recuperate from the birth.

The 31-year-old, who is very close to her parents Michael and Carole, was said to be 'feeling remarkably well' during her stay at their house in the village of Bucklebury.

Kate had a troubled start to her pregnancy, but the later months seemed to be much easier.

After she was diagnosed with a condition similar to severe morning sickness, the Duchess was forced to reveal that she was pregnant earlier than she would have liked.

She kept a low profile for several months, but during her middle trimester carried out a number of public engagements during which she appeared happy and healthy.

In total, Kate carried out 19 days of engagements during the six and a half months following the announcement of her pregnancy in December 2012.

Her last solo event came on June 13 when she named a new cruise liner, the Royal Princess.

Two days later, she stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace alongside her husband and several of his relatives to watch the Trooping the Colour ceremony.

On June 22, the Duchess opted not to attend the wedding of William's close friend Thomas van Straubenzee due to the risk she might go into labour.

Another high-profile event which she missed was the Coronation Festival at Buckingham Palace on July 11, which was attended by her parents, her sister Pippa and her brother James, as well as numerous members of the Royal Family.

She has since been able to enjoy a full month of rest, thanks to the arrival of her baby roughly on schedule. 

Anticipation: News crews and fans of the Royal Family have been gathered outside the hospital for weeks

News: The birth was officially announced on an easel set up outside Buckingham Palace

The calm of the past few weeks stands in stark contrast to the difficulties Kate experienced at the beginning of her pregnancy.

The news that she would give birth was announced on December 3 last year, when she was admitted to hospital with symptoms of severe morning sickness.

St James's Palace chose to reveal her pregnancy rather than risk it leaking out - even though she was only two months pregnant, while most expectant mothers wait until their 12-week scan to share the news.

Doctors said she was suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, which can cause dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine.

Soon after Kate's admission to hospital, prank callers from an Australian radio station tricked a nurse into revealing sensitive information about her condition.

Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put through the prank call, committed suicide later the same week, which apparently left the Duke and Duchess deeply saddened.

Kate made her first public appearance since the announcement two weeks after she left hospital, when she presented the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year award to cyclist Bradley Wiggins.

She and William spent Christmas with the Middletons in Bucklebury and did not attend church in Sandringham with the other Royals.

With her health on the mend, Kate flew with her husband for a 'babymoon' on the Caribbean island of Mustique, staying in a £19,000-a-week luxury villa.

However, the couple were disappointed when a number of foreign gossip magazines ran paparazzi photographs of her in a bikini displaying a slight bump.

In January and February, Kate carried out just one public engagement in each month, but in March she under took five days of public royal visits.

William and Kate also travelled to Switzerland for a friend's wedding in the ski resort of Arosa.

During a visit to Grimsby, Kate seemed to let slip that she was expecting a daughter - however, at a St Patrick's Day parade she told a soldier they did not know the sex, but that she would like a boy and William a girl.

In March, William and Kate visited the headquarters of Child Bereavement UK, exchanging hugs with bereaved parents and also meeting TV cook Mary Berry.

The Duchess also joined the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Baker Street underground station to mark the 150th anniversary of the Tube. She was given a 'Baby on board' badge.

In snowy conditions, she visited a Scout camp in the Lake District to join other volunteers who were being trained.

During a two-day visit to Scotland in April, Kate disclosed she had taken up knitting ahead of the birth. 'I've been trying to knit and I'm really bad. I should be asking for tips,' she admitted.

She also joined William and the Prince of Wales for a visit to Dumfries House in Ayrshire, where Kate was given a 'Princess Catherine' doll by a bystander and expressed shock at the size of its hair.

As her pregnancy progressed, Kate was also working behind the scenes, choosing three more charities to patronise - SportsAid, the Natural History Museum and Place2Be, a mental health charity for schoolchildren.

It was not until late April when she was six months pregnant that her bump became truly noticeable as she carried out the National Review of Queen's Scouts at Windsor Castle.

Dressed in a £1,065 blue patterned silk Erdem dress by Sophia Visconti, Kate visited Willows Primary School on the deprived Wythenshawe estate in Greater Manchester in late April, when she also attended an evening reception at the National Portrait Gallery in honour of The Art Room charity.

At the Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, where the Harry Potter films were made, she duelled with William after being given her own wand.

On April 29, the Duchess spent part of her second wedding anniversary celebrating Children's Hospice Week with a visit to Naomi House Children's Hospice in Hampshire, while William, an RAF search and rescue pilot, was on duty in north Wales.

The couple enjoyed a trip to Oxfordshire in May to attend the wedding of close friends William van Cutsem and Rosie Ruck Keene.

Kate joined the Queen for a garden party at Buckingham Palace and on June 4 gathered with the rest of the Windsors for a service marking the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation at Westminster Abbey, before her final pair of engagements later that month.
