News anchor Scott Pelley left a Broadway show so he could announce his colleague Bob Simon's death live on air.

With a shaky voice, he told viewers the 73-year-old had died in an accident on Manhattan's West Side Highway after rushing back to the CBS studio.

Pelley offered condolences on the part of the network to Simon's family during the emotional broadcast.

An emotional Scott Pelley, who was a longtime colleague of Simon at CBS, announced the tragic news on Wednesday evening. He was at a Broadway show when he heard the news and rushed back

'We have some sad news from within our CBS news family. Our 60 Minutes colleague Bob Simon was killed this evening,' he said on Wednesday.

Simon, who survived being held in an Iraqi prison under the regime of Saddam Hussein and was one of the last reporters to leave Saigon during the Vietnam War, died in the backseat of a taxi.

Twisted wreckage: All that is left of the Lincoln town car Simon was travelling in following the accident in New York City

The Emmy-award winning reporter had been travelling in a Lincoln town car when it rear-ended a Mercedes-Benz stopped at a red light on 12th Avenue near West 30th Street around 6.45pm, and then slammed into the metal barriers separating the lanes. 

He was found unconscious in the backseat with injuries to his head and stomach and was pronounced dead at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center.

Pelley had been watching Honeymoon in Vegas with his wife, Jane, on Wednesday night when news of the tragedy unfolded.

He made an abrupt exit during the performance and dashed to the studio.

A source said: 'Scott rushed to the studio as soon as he got word that Bob Simon had passed away,' a source said. 'Moments later, he broke into network programming at 10 p.m. to deliver the news of his colleague's death.'

Pelley looked red-eyed as he related the sad news on-air and later tweeted: 'One of the great writers of a generation has passed. Bob Simon was a journalist of extraordinary courage.'

In a statement, 60 Minutes Executive Producer Jeff Fager said: 'It's a terrible loss for all of us at CBS News.

'It is such a tragedy made worse because we lost him in a car accident, a man who has escaped more difficult situations than almost any journalist in modern times.'
