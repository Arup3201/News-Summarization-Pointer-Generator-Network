Australian journalist Peter Greste has been released from Egyptian prison and is on his way back to Australia after more than a year behind bars.

Mr Greste was freed by order of Egypt's president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, under a new law that allows foreign prisoners to be deported.

His brother Andrew Greste confirmed the Al-Jazeera reporter 'has left Egyptian airspace' and will arrive home in Brisbane on Monday.

His overjoyed sibling wrote on Twitter: 'Hard to believe but YES @PeterGreste is a free man. His butt has left Egyptian airspace yippeeeeee!!!!! Think I'll go and get drunk :):):).'

Mr Greste arrived in Larnaca, Cyprus, on Sunday night after flying out of Cairo on an EgyptAir flight alongside one of his brothers. 

The family was ecstatic and called for the world to respect his brother's privacy and to give him time to appreciate his freedom.

A Canadian journalist also being held in Egypt will also be released 'within days', security officials have revealed.

Mr Greste's Canadian-Egyptian colleague Mohamed Fahmy is set to be released after officials negotiated for him to be deported to North America.

The pair were jailed for at least seven years alongside Baher Mohamed for fabricating the news, despite no evidence of this ever being shown to a court. 

The officials who confirmed his release spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. 

Sunday marked the 400th day since Mr Greste's arrest and imprisonment, along with his two colleagues.

The trio were convicted of fabricating news footage on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, despite no evidence being produced.

Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Mr Greste is desperate to return to Australia.

'I spoke to Peter Greste shortly after his release and before he departed Egypt,' she told reporters in Sydney on Monday.

'He was immensely relieved and he was desperate to come home to Australia and reunite with his family.'

Ms Bishop confirmed he was now in Cyprus and had been met by Australian consular officials.

'From my discussion with him, he was very keen to be back on a beach and lying in the sun in Australia,' she said.

The overjoyed sibling sent a message of thanks to all of their support in fighting for Greste's release 

Events moved very quickly overnight with the minister saying Greste was given short notice he would be released 'unconditionally'.

'We moved as fast as we could to make arrangements for his immediate departure,' Ms Bishop said.

'He will make his way home in his own time.

'He wants a bit of rest and recreation and to be re-united with friends and family as soon as possible.'

Ms Bishop said Greste had gone through a long ordeal and she was relieved and delighted he was finally on his way home.

'Australia has been at the forefront of calling for his release,' she said.

'We have worked very hard behind the scenes, working directly with the Egyptian government.'

Ms Bishop also thanked a number of other governments around the world who had supported his cause and, at Australia's request, made representations on his behalf to the Egyptian government.

'I personally spoke with the foreign minister in Egypt and made a number of representations, oral and in writing, and spoke to President al-Sisi,' she said.

'I particularly mention the government of Latvia, given Peter's family background - the Latvian government were also of great assistance.'

Ms Bishop also paid tribute to the role of consular staff in his release, noting that Greste had thanked the Australian government, the public and journalists who has rallied to his cause.

'He told me that it had sustained him through the very long time that he spent in jail.' 

A statement from Al Jazeera welcomed the news that Mr Greste had been freed, but said it would continue to fight for his colleagues' release.

'We're pleased for Peter and his family that they are to be reunited. It has been an incredible and unjustifiable ordeal for them, and they have coped with incredible dignity,' the statement said.

'Peter's integrity is not just intact, but has been further enhanced by the fortitude and sacrifice he has shown for his profession of informing the public.

'We will not rest until Baher and Mohamed also regain their freedom. The Egyptian authorities have it in their power to finish this properly today, and that is exactly what they must do.'

Earlier this month Egypt's Court of Cassation ordered a retrial of Mr Greste and his colleagues. 

At the time, his family said they were pinning hopes for their son's freedom on his chances of being deported before a second trial.

Greste, Egyptian-Canadian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Mohammed Baher were sentenced to at least seven years in prison on terrorism-related charges last year in a trial described as a sham by rights groups. There was no immediate word on the other two journalists. 

The three were arrested over their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. Egyptian authorities accused them of providing a platform for Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, now declared a terrorist organization.

Rights groups and several media outlets condemned the verdicts as political, saying the three were doing their job during a tumultuous time.

According to a law passed late last year, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has the power to deport foreign defendants or convicts if it's considered to be in the interest of national security. The law was seen as providing a potential legal instrument with which to free the journalists.

El-Sissi had repeatedly said he wants to end the case, which has prompted a storm of international criticism.
