Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, has been a longstanding critic of the war in Afghanistan

A Labour MP was today kicked out of the House of Commons after accusing defence ministers of lying over military policy in Afghanistan.

Paul Flynn, MP for Newport West, was suspended by Speaker John Bercow after likening the government’s approach to the First World War when ‘politicians lied and soldiers died’.

He said the public wanted British troops brought home.

It came as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond was forced to appear at the despatch box to respond to reports that Nato was scaling back operations with Afghan forces after a spate of attacks by rogue soldiers and policemen.

Mr Hammond said Mr Flynn's claims about the government’s approach ‘were scandalous’.

But Mr Flynn refused to withdraw them, and was told to leave.

Giving an emergency statement, Mr Hammond was responding to news that Nato troops and their Afghan counterparts would axe joint, routine patrols and only launch big strike missions.

The minister claimed Britain's strategy was unchanged.

But he said the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) had taken ‘prudent but temporary measures’ following outrage among Muslims at a YouTube video mocking the prophet Mohammed.

Then Mr Flynn spoke out, directly accusing ministers of culpability in the rising death toll of British troops.

He said: ‘The role of our brave soldiers at the moment is to act as human shields for ministers' reputation.

‘The danger to our soldiers is being prolonged by those on that (front) bench who have the power to stop it.

‘Other countries have removed their soldiers from this dangerous area where they are not doing what we are doing which is arming and training our future enemy.

‘Isn't this very similar to the end of the First World War, when it was said that politicians lied and soldiers died and the reality was, as it is now, that our brave soldier lions are being led by ministerial donkeys.’

Mr Bercow interrupted and questioned whether he had intended to accuse ministers of lkying, something which is banned in Parliament.

‘That's precisely what I am saying’ Mr Flynn replied. ‘I believe we have had lies from the minister and I believe that our soldiers are being let down.'

For a second time Mr Bercow intervened, and told Mr Flynn to withdraw the remark, but he refused.

Commons Speaker John Bercow twice intervened to order Paul Flynn to withdraw his claim the ministers had lied - but he refused

Mr Flynn insisted: ‘I have to insist on retaining my accusation of lying. That is far more important than a lying group of people who send our soldiers to die in vain in a war which we should withdraw and from which the country wants us to withdraw.

‘I accept the consequences of what I am saying.’

At which point Mr Bercow used a Commons procedure to ‘name’ Mr Flynn, and a motion was moved to suspend him from the Commons for the rest of the day.

Mr Bercow said: ‘I'm sorry to say you are ignoring the ruling of the chair and in so doing you are behaving, whatever your motives, in a grossly disorderly manner and in those circumstances I am obliged to name Paul Flynn, the MP for Newport West.’

Mr Hammond said: 'My response was going to be simply to note that Mr Flynn's accusation was scandalous.'

The Defence Secretary has faced repeated calls for British troops to be brought home by Christmas.

In the Commons today, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said: 'Are you really going to allow more troops to die for a war that's not been won, that cannot be won and will become increasingly unpopular with the public in this country?'

Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former commander of UN forces in Bosnia, added: 'It worries me a great deal we are continuing to allow our soldiers to go right to the front line and they are therefore seemingly in greater danger than their American colleagues.'
