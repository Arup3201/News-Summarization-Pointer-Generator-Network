From the period drama settings of Downton Abbey and Pride and Prejudice to the reality TV location of Made In Chelsea or the sedate and serene backdrop of Bake Off, couples looking to say ‘I do’ can now follow in the footsteps of small and silver screen stars for their big day.

From the elegant Orangery at Goldney Hall in Bristol, which was recently the set of Dr Watson’s eventful wedding in Sherlock, to Clandon Park in Surrey which was home to Keira Knightley in The Duchess, these are just some of the locations available to hire to provide the ‘wow factor’.

According to a recent survey, church weddings are on the decline with only 35 percent taking place in this traditional venue.

Now, You & Your Wedding Venue Finder which currently has details of 1,000 wedding venues, has compiled a top ten list of TV and film locations which can be hired for a wedding.

Yesterday romance expert Tiffany Wright, 33, who co-runs the UK’s only proposal planning agency, said she was not surprised they have become popular choices for weddings.

The cast of Made In Chelsea often head to the Bluebird on Kings Road to chat about their complex love lives

Downton: You could have the run of Mrs Crawley's residence, Hall Place in Berkshire, for £6,000

Miss Wright said: ‘We have a lot of clients who want to propose at popular TV and film locations and it does not surprise me that they are also popular for weddings.

‘I think it’s to do with the glamour behind it. Everyone wants to feel like a celebrity these days. Weddings are becoming bigger and more extravagant and many take place abroad now.

'Choosing a film or TV location can give it the ‘wow factor’ and it’s not just important for the bride and groom but also for the wedding guests.

Notting Hill: The Ritz, which featured in the 1999 Hugh Grant film, offers a dinner package starting at £250 each

The Great British Bake Off takes place in tents in the grounds of Valentine's Mansion in Essex

'If they are stepping into a world that they have seen on TV or film it adds an element of excitement. And so it’s not just an average wedding that they’ve been to a million times before.’  

In recent years the Church of England has considered allowing couples to have ‘Posh and Becks’ weddings as part of a drive to raise the popularity of its marriage services.

Brides and grooms may be allowed to introduce pop music into church weddings or to stage extravagant ceremonies, for example brides passing through the church doors on horseback.

Pride and Prejudice: The BBC chose Brocket Hall as the location to film the Netherfield ball, and you can chose it too, for the price of £15,000

Brocket Hall features in the iconic Pride and Prejudice which turned Colin Firth into a sex symbol

The Duchess: Clandon Park, Surrey, was home to Georgiana Cavendish, played by Kiera Knightley in the 2008 film. It can also be rented for £3,000

Churches may also allow photographers and cameramen to film during the service, a practice traditionally frowned upon.

The initiative, dubbed the Posh and Becks scheme after the celebrity couple were married on golden thrones more than a decade ago - has been produced by a Church committee in the past anxious to build on an improvement in numbers of CofE marriages in recent years.

Examples of customised wedding ceremonies suggested to vicars include biker weddings, where leatherclad couples may be brought to the church on vintage motorcycles.

Elizabeth: Royal Leeds Castle, Kent, which featured in the 1998 film, will cost around £200 per head

Harry Potter: As muggles can't get to platform nine and three-quarters, why not celebrate at Searcy's Champagne Bar in the station, which costs £60 per head

Church weddings had been declining in popularity since before 2010, when CofE marriage numbers increased by 4 per cent to nearly 55,000.

The increase followed legal reforms which have allowed couples a much greater choice over the church in which they can have their wedding, and an easing of restrictions of the marriage of divorcees in church.
