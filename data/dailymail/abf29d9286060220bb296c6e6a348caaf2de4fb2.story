Dogs are almost four times better at detecting prostate cancer than traditional tests.

Medical Detection Dogs accurately detect the disease 90 per cent of the time, research has shown.

In contrast, traditional PSA tests often give false positives – three in four positive results from the tests turn out to be false and result in unnecessary and invasive tests.

Medical Detection Dogs are better at diagnosing prostate cancer than traditional tests are

Specially trained Cancer Detection Dogs can detect cancer cells in urine samples.

The dogs are trained by the charity Medical Detection Dogs, in Buckinghamshire.

Dr Claire Guest, Chief Executive and Director of Operations at Medical Detection Dogs, said:‘These results from the detection dogs are remarkable.

‘Over the years, millions of pounds of NHS funding have been poured into the traditional test methods, and yet there has been little improvement in their reliability.

‘This has caused a huge waste of resources, not to mention the distress to the impacted individuals.

‘Moreover, the detection dogs provide alternative solution that yields consistently accurate results. If our detection dogs were a machine, there would be huge demand for them.

‘Dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts. Their superior smelling power is well known. So why the reluctance to embrace this tested, time-old technology?’

As times goes by there is increasing interested about the work of Medical Detection Dogs.

The charity has been invited to the House of Lords to showcase its work this evening.

While they are there, the dogs will demonstrate their ability to detect cancer in urine samples.

The Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith and his wife Betsy, a trustee of the charity, will also be attending to lend their support.

Betsy 
Duncan Smith said: ‘I am so pleased to see this government, and at last 
some people in the medical profession, are taking an interest in this 
life-changing work.

Some 75 per cent of positive PSA test results turn out, on further investigation, to be false

‘We
 have long recognised the remarkable ability of dogs to assist the blind
 and deaf.  Now we are realising how much more they are capable of.

‘MDD’s trained dogs can detect cancer before noticeable symptoms and others have been trained to recognise dangerously low sugar levels in diabetics.  In short, this wonderful charity is training dogs to save lives.

‘Iain and I are trying to help the charity.  We’ve recently fostered one of the cancer detection dogs.  We are both enjoying having Jobi, a delightful little black spaniel, around the house!’

It has also previously been shown that dogs can detect other cancers, including bladder, ovarian and breast cancers.
