For years they’ve topped the list of disappointing presents. Up there with talc and drawer-scenters, bath salts were the least sexy of all Christmas ‘smellies’.

Or at least they were until now.

Because this Christmas bath salts have shaken off their maiden aunt image and are marching proudly into the 21st century.

Dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting says Dead Sea salts may offer anti-inflammatory properties from the absorption of minerals such as magnesium into itchy skin

There have never been so many varieties on sale, and, after years in the fuddy-duddy doldrums, business is booming. Boots say sales of bath salts are soaring, citing celebrity fans such as Victoria Beckham and Jennifer Lawrence as one reason behind the surge.

Sophie Beresiner, beauty director at Elle magazine, thinks she knows another reason why bath salts are enjoying a resurgence. ‘As we become increasingly time and money-poor, indulging in a bath is a real luxury,’ she says. ‘It’s downtime that we schedule in, and we want to ensure maximum relaxation.

‘Using bath salts makes it something of a ritual, especially if they are a premium brand, great quality and scent the whole bathroom.’

What sets bath salts apart from bubbles or oils is their reputation for healing properties.

Tired limbs, sore backs, pulled muscles, stress tensions and even insomnia are all still thought to be cured by a long, salty soak.

Bath salts contain an abundance of trace minerals such as sulphur and magnesium that dissolve in your bath and mimic the properties of natural hot springs and therapeutic baths.

Some bath salts contain phosphates, which help to exfoliate and soften skin, others glycerin, which lock in moisture. Many come with added essential oils with all their mood-enhancing aromatherapy benefits, muscle-soothing properties and detoxification qualities.

If you want the ultimate in relaxation, Himalayan Bath Salts by Therapie (£37 for 400g; cultbeauty.co.uk), created by renowned aromatherapist Michelle Roques O’Neil, are just the thing. These luxurious bath salts, scented with juniper and lemon grass essential oils, promise to lower stress levels and help you relax. A bath with these is as good as a sleeping pill.

Mauli Sacred Detox Salts (£39 for 450g; maulirituals.com) are a little special, so save them for when you really need a lift. Beloved of celebrities such as Laura Bailey and Emma Freud, these Himalayan pink salts, thought to contain 84 of the 92 trace minerals found in the body, have been infused with Mauli’s signature blend of 13 therapeutic oils – including patchouli, sandalwood and Frankincense.

If you’re having trouble sleeping, look for bath salts containing lavender, which has been scientifically proven to enhance sleep, such as L’Occitane Relaxing Bath Salts (£16 for 300g; loccitane.com). Or add 2tbsp of Aveda Stress-Fix Soaking Salts (£31 for 450g, aveda.co.uk) to your bath and all your troubles will just drift away. Infused with lavender essential oils and clary sage, which is thought to help balance the central nervous system, these smell wonderful and feel very luxurious. Heaven in a bath soak.

If it’s aches and pains you’re suffering from, look for salts that contain thyme, known for its ability to soothe joint and muscle pain. Try Radox Muscle Soak (£1.05 for 400g, boots.com).

If you’ve got a sniffle go for Kneipp Cold and Sinus Relief, (£6.99 for 500g, kneippus.com) as eucalyptus is a decongestant.

And if you’re worrying about fitting into your party dress, then a bath with Epsom salts may be just the thing — Elle Macpherson has often cited a bath with salts as her secret weapon in maintaining her enviably flat stomach.

Meanwhile, Gwyneth Paltrow, who believes in the detoxifying qualities of bath salts, raves about an Epsom salt bath to relieve a hangover.

One of the nicest things about a salt bath is the feeling of buoyancy; when salts are used in high concentrations your limbs feel lighter, as if you’re floating. Rubbed on your skin, they’re a great exfoliator.

Dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting says: ‘Where as our usual bubble bath can leave dry, winter skin even more parched, bath salts infused with essential oils can deliver the same aromatic hit without the harsh chemical agents needed to create bubbles.

She adds: ‘Those from the Dead Sea may also offer additional anti-inflammatory properties from the absorption of minerals such as magnesium into itchy skin.’

Try Dead Sea Genuine Bath Salts (£7.89 for 1,000g, boots.com). You won’t get heavenly aromas or the soporific effects from essential oils, but these are the real deal. The only ingredient is unadulterated Dead Sea salt. Swirl in warm water and just feel the healing effects. Bliss.

And if the season of goodwill has left you penniless, fear not, it couldn’t be easier to make your own bath salts and give them to loved ones as a homemade gift. Just mix up Epsom salts with essential oils, add dried herbs such as thyme or rosemary, a few drops of food colouring, and you’re all set.

If you want to go the extra mile, seek out a vintage tin in which to present your gift. You’ll not only be giving the gift of a good night’s sleep, but an enhanced mood and a flatter stomach.
