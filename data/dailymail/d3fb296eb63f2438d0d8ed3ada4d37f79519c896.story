Leyton Orient manager Russell Slade has issued a hands-off warning to clubs hoping to poach winger Moses Odubajo.

The 20-year-old, who has been monitored by Tottenham and West Ham, set Wembley alight with his stunning opening goal in Orient's playoff final defeat to Rotherham.

He also set up the second goal which looked to have earned Orient promotion to the Championship, only for them to squander the lead and lose on penalties.

Defiant: Orient boss Russell Slade (right) says it'll take a sizeable offer for the club to sell Odubajo

Odubajo is under contract at Orient until 2015 and, despite missing out on promotion, Slade is adamant he is going nowhere.

'The first thing is he's under contract, he's our player, someones got to come in with a sizeable offer if they want him,' he said.

'You don't get too many 20-year-olds who have played more than 100 games.

'He took his goal magnificently well, he's a product of our youth policy and he's a great individual and someone we'll want to keep hold of.'
