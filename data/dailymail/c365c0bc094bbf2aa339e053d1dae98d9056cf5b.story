Jailed: Rizwan Butt, a fraudster who duped a European businesswoman out of more than £650,000, has been jailed today

A former security guard who posed as an investment tycoon to con a German businesswoman out of £625,000 has been jailed for three-and-a-half years.

Rizwan Butt, 45, from Manchester, tricked company chief executive Talke Stauss by pretending to be a go-between for a potential $1.5 billion dollar investment into her hedge fund.

Mrs Stauss, 46, held a series of business meetings with Butt at top London hotels The Dorchester and The Ritz not realising the bachelor had been living with his mother in a £56,000 inner city terraced house in Longsight, Manchester.

During the two-month scam Butt went on 'a charm offensive' with his knowledge of finance, talk of introducing investors from the Middle East and of having a Swiss bank account.

After one meeting he drove former semi-professional tennis player Mrs Stauss back to her apartment in a Bentley and later professed his love for her.

When he asked for $1milion as a returnable security deposit to clinch the deal, Mrs Stauss and her husband Roman, 44, agreed to transfer the money in sterling to Butt’s bank account without carrying out any checks on his background.

But the alarm was raised after Eddie George - a fellow director at ATG Investment Managers Ltd - found out about the deposit and looked into Butt's background.

He discovered Butt in fact ran a cleaning company with net assets of just £657.

Mrs Stauss realised she had been duped when she returned from a business trip with Butt in Shanghai with a plan to leave her husband - only to be faced by Mr George insisting her lover was a fraud.

When Mrs Stauss asked for the money back, Butt - who had flown home early - sent a text message saying: 'Talke my dear. No problem my love. They should have it by five this evening. Take care love. Kisses.'

Four weeks later when police caught up with Butt he was at the wheel of a black Audi Q7 carrying a wad of £1,000 in cash. He had recently bought a house for £175,000 and had a black Mercedes parked in the driveway.

The Bentley turned out to be rented and before the scam he drove a 2003 Honda Accord.

Butt, who the sole carer to his 72-year-old mother who is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, was convicted of two counts of fraud by false representation and one count of money laundering last month.

He was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for three-and-a-half years today.

Sentencing, Judge Peter Openshaw told him: 'It is obvious that he managed to charm her before he wormed his way into her affections.

'She fell under his spell, she became infatuated with him and in the process she seems to have lost her critical faculties and made no checks.

'She didn’t ask for character or credit references, she said simply she trusted him. In my mind she was naive to the point of being vulnerable as the defendant recognised.

'He took advantage of her, spinning extravagant and absurd lies. It were a complete fiction yet she apparently swallowed it all.

'He has not shown the slightest regret or remorse. It seems to me cunning. He did not squander the proceeds and substantial amount remains in the bank account where it was restrained.

'Today he has produced documents giving consent to pay ATG Investment Managers Ltd £553,167.61.

'This was a brazen fraud committed with considerable scheming. He played the high stake game and the price must be paid.'

Before the scam, Butt worked as a security guard, lived with his mother and had bought his new house with a £30,000 deposit he borrowed from two friends.

During the trial Butt claimed the $1.5b deal would have gone through but it failed as ATG did not have a relevant trading licence.

The jury was told the Mr and Mrs Stauss and Mr George had formed ATG in April 2012 set up an office in Clerkenwell, in London and were aiming to form a hedge fund using their expertise on banking and foreign exchange.

They were introduced to Butt though a German friend who met him at a renewable energy fair and believed he was genuine. Butt said he was interested in investing and a meeting was held at the Dorchester Hotel on August 3 2012.

At a meeting at the same hotel a week later, Butt introduced Mrs Stauss to a man he said was the 'doctor from Dover' as another potential investor. He then drove Mrs Stauss home in his Bentley before saying he was dropping off his friend at the ferry port.

At a third meeting at The Dorchester on August 17, Butt said he wanted to introduce investors from Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia who had $1.5billion to invest in the hedge fund and later at a wedding the Stauss’ were asked to pay a $1m security despot to Butt to 'demonstrate the legitimacy and viability' of ATG.

During a subsequent meeting in a Lebanese restaurant in Knightsbridge on September 7 Butt promised to pay back the money immediately once he had shown it to his investors.

The money was transferred to the account of Butt’s cleaning company Horizon Solutions UK on September 14.

Butt then sent Mrs Stauss an email saying: 'Hello Talke. Hope all is well with you. Meeting went really well but unfortunately I’m still here trying to sort other bits out. My investors have transferred 1.5billion into my account.

'They don’t know what security deposit I am taking off you so you need to sort this out quick so I can give them the feedback.'

She replied: 'Hi Riz that sounds all good and great. Been with HSBC and they guarantee the money to be in the account by 5pm today. For your security I attach the proof of transfer with this email.'

Later the pair flew to Shanghai to investigate potential investments but Butt returned to the UK early claiming his mother was ill. It emerged Butt had withdrawn £130,000 from the account just seven days after the money went in.

As the alleged fraud unfolded Butt sent other texts to Mrs Stauss saying: 'Good morning my dear hope you’re well. The funds should be in your account by now as they’re out of mine.'

Another said: 'Tell him not to worry. He will have the funds. B patience.'

Mrs Stauss told the hearing: 'He said he fell in love with me. I was then charmed and fell in love with him. The nature of the relationship was too deep for comfort. I was under additional pressure when he confessed his love. I reciprocated and regret that very much.

'For him he indicated I was a prized possession and would bring success for the company. I gave in to the pressure.'

Mr Stauss said: 'This was the first time her business decision and my business decision were not correct because we were involved with someone who played a very clever game.'

Speaking after the court hearing PC Jane McHale said: 'There is no doubt that Butt can talk the talk and walk the walk.

'He lived in a modest home and had a registered company with minimal assets, but played the role of a man with international business connections worth billions of pounds with apparent ease.

'So convincing was his portrayal, that he was able to dupe a number of highly successful and experienced business people out of huge sums.

'His assets have been frozen and now that he has been convicted we will use the full force of the law to recoup as much of the stolen money as possible.'
