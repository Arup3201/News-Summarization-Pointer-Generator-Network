New Jersey police said they have identified more than one person of interest over the unsolved murder of four prostitutes whose bodies were found in Atlantic City in November 2006.

No suspects have yet been named, but the case has taken officers from the bright lights of Atlantic City in New Jersey, to Florida, Missouri and Alaska.

The women, aged between 19 and 42, had been killed and their bodies dumped within 50 yards of each other in a drainage ditch close to the town's casinos.

Discovery: Kimberly Raffo, 35, was found first

Victim: Molly Dilts, 19, was killed first

Police told Fox News they were 'quietly and aggressively working the case', and that their investigation had taken them across the U.S. as they tried to make connections with similar killings.

The search for the serial killer began in November 2006, when two women found the body of Kimberly Raffo, 35.

She was laying face down in run-off water filled with fecal matter and chemical waste, behind the Golden Key Motel.

When police arrived they found the bodies of three other women, all barefoot but clothed, in the same ditch, all of them prostitutes.

Because their shoes were missing it led to speculation that the killer may have a foot fetish, and had kept the shoes as a trophy, according to the New York Times.

Miss Raffo, and the other victims - 19-year-old Molly Dilts, Tracy Ann Roberts, 23, and Barbara Breidor, 42 - all had children, and all had been forced to turn to the sex trade for money.

Miss Roberts and Miss Raffo, who were the more recent victims, had been strangled, but the bodies of Miss Dilts, the first victim, and Miss Breidor were so decomposed a cause of death could not be established.

Only two of them had been reported missing before the bodies were found.

Attack: Tracy Ann Roberts, 23, had been strangled

Killed: Barbara Breidor, 42, was the oldest victim

'This fits the FBI definition of a 
serial killer,' Atlantic County Prosecutor James P. McClain said last week. 'From the facts gathered during the investigation, 
it could have been a local person or it could have been a transient.'

Kate
 D’Adamo, a spokesman for the Sex Workers Outreach 
Project, said it was likely that other women had encountered the killer, but did not
 report it to police for fear of a prostitution arrest.

Despite the case remaining unsolved for seven years however, Mr Mclain said it did not mean police were not concerned about prostitutes.

'No one should ever think that 
because someone works as a prostitute or works in the sex trade that 
they’re not going to get law enforcement’s best efforts. Everybody 
counts,' he said.

Mr McClain, who is the third prosecutor to take office since the bodies was found, added: 'I have great hope in 
justice. I’ll never give up on that.'

The case has been linked previously to the ten bodies found in Long Island in 2010. The month before she was killed, Miss Raffo had been staying a motel close to where the bodies were found in Gilgo Beach.

The connection led authorities in 2011 to question whether the killer used several methods of murder and display in order to confuse authorities, or if more than one murderer was involved, according to the Examiner.
