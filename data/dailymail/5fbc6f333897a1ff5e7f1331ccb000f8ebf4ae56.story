Prominent Tory MP Zac Goldsmith last night threatened to quit ‘immediately’ if the party softens its opposition to expansion at Heathrow Airport.

David Cameron is set to order an independent commission into the future of Britain’s airports in a bid to end Tory infighting over the issue and secure a wider political consensus.

Downing Street yesterday indicated that it would include ‘all the options’ for expanding airport capacity in the South East, including a new runway at Heathrow.

A spokesman insisted the Government would stick to its pledge not to build a third runway at Heathrow during this Parliament.

But some ministers, including Chancellor George Osborne, are pressing for the pledge to be dropped at the 2015 election.

Mr Goldsmith, a former adviser on the environment to David Cameron, said he would quit immediately if this happens, triggering a by-election in his Richmond Park constituency in London, which lies under the Heathrow flight path.

‘I promised before the election that if the Conservatives perform a U-turn on Heathrow, I would trigger an immediate by-election so that local voters can have their say,’ he said. ‘Clearly, I would honour that commitment.’

Transport Secretary Justine Greening has also said it would be ‘difficult’ for her to continue in Cabinet if the party went back on its pledge on Heathrow.

Number 10 yesterday confirmed that BAA, Heathrow’s operator, will be allowed to press its case for a third runway in the forthcoming review, prompting speculation about an impending U-turn.

Mr Goldsmith warned any ‘ambiguity’ about the party’s intentions would wreck its hope in a huge swathe of constituencies near Heathrow.

‘I think if we enter the next election with a manifesto which does not rule out expansion of Heathrow I think the Conservative Party will be very badly defeated in areas beneath the flight path,’ he said.
