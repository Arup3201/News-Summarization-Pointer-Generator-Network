Nilson Dos Santos, the barista at the centre of a race row at a Sydney café, has revealed his delight at landing a new job after being told people ‘don’t want their coffee made by black people’.

Mr Dos Santos, a Brazilian who has lived in Australia for nine years, was shocked when the owner of Forbes and Burton Café refused to hire him when he arrived at the inner Sydney café 10 days ago.

The 37-year-old was so enraged that he stood up and told the patrons of the café what the owner, Steven Hu, had said to him, prompting a mass walk-out from customers and a staff member.

The story, which was first reported by Daily Mail Australia, garnered worldwide attention and caused such public outrage in Sydney that the café has since shut its doors and is being investigated by the Fair Work Ombudsman.

But now Mr Dos Santos can finally put the ordeal behind him with a new full-time job making coffee at Darlinghurst establishment Coco Cubano – about four minutes’ walk from Forbes and Burton.

‘I’m so excited, it’s such a relief. When I heard I had the job, it’s the first time I’ve really smiled since this whole crazy thing happened,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

Nilson Dos Santos is working as a barista at his new job (pictured.) He is excited and ready to move on with his life. Ten days ago, he was told customers 'do not want their coffee made by a black person' by the owner of another inner Sydney café.

The 37-year-old barista is thankful for all the 'beautiful support' he has received and is excited for a new start.

‘I’m moving house too… There are lots of new starts, it’s a new beginning.

‘I feel very happy for my new job. I feel that it’s time to move on.’

Mr Dos Santos said he was hugely grateful to all the support he’d received since his story broke, describing the feedback from members as the public as ‘beautiful’.

 ‘I wish I could hug and thank every one of the people for the support they have given to me,’ he said.

‘The beautiful thing is how something so negative has become something so positive.

‘But now, when the hard times come for me, I will always know how much love that I have and how after this crazy thing people made me feel so strong. I will always hold onto that beautiful memory.’

Nilson Dos Santos (pictured at his new job at Coco Cubano in Darlinghurst) couldn't believe that people heard about his story all over the world and how something 'so negative has become something so positive'

Mr Dos Santos was overwhelmed by the reaction and couldn’t believe that people heard about his story all over the world.

‘A friend of mine lives in Germany at the moment and he called me and he said “Nilson, what happened? Everybody’s talking about you right now. It’s big news here!”,’ he said.

‘Friends of mine who live in Hong Kong sent me his love, everyone talked about it in Brazil as well. It’s been much bigger than I thought it would ever be. It shows how kind people can be.’

The barista was inundated with job offers, revealing he was contacted by about 40 cafes after the news broke. He said it had been a very humbling experience.

‘I am very, very happy about my new job, it feel fantastic to be secure about my job and they will be loyal to you and look after you – that was exactly what I was looking for,’ he said.

The Brazillian-born Australian citizen is still very proud to be Australian and happy that he chose to live here. Mr Dos Santos wants to assure the public that he still feels welcome and 'free' in Sydney.

Mr Dos Santos is now encouraging others to stand up against discrimination and hopes that people can learn from his experience.

‘You always have to believe in yourself and stand up for yourself. Don’t let somebody else let you down. Wherever you come from, whatever colour you have, that’s not the point,’ he said.

‘The point is that you must be respected and you must be loved because you deserve that.

‘If I can do it, everyone else can do it. If it’s happening to you, try to do it. Don’t let anybody else tell you you’re not able to do something.’

Mr Dos Santos received more than forty job offers, from people who wished to have the smiling Brazillian make coffees for their customers. He is working full-time at Coco Cubano, an establishment in Darlinghurst.

But while the newly employed barista is still angry about what happened, he revealed he’s disappointed to see people respond negatively to his story by vandalising Forbes and Burton café.

He says he tried to return to the café to ‘face what happened’ on the weekend but says he was distressed to see that the café had been vandalised.

‘On Sunday I thought it was time to face what happened and go past the coffee shop – just out the front,’ he said.

‘But I saw all the eggs on the shop windows and that it was close and I broke down and cried.’

Mr Dos Santos, pictured at his new job, hopes that people who are also being discriminated against speak out. 'If I can do it, you can too!' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Dos Santos said the support from the gay and Aboriginal communities had been ‘fantastic’, and added that despite recent events he feels like ‘Australia is home’.

‘I always loved Australia and now I’d say that I’m in love with this country. This is my home, this is where I want to be,’ he said.

‘I was always looking for somewhere to call home. That was my dream when I was a child. I’ve always just wanted somewhere so I could say “that’s my home”. And I have that in Australia.’

He said that when Coco Cubano asked him what he wanted out of life – a question that some may struggle with in an interview – he didn’t hesitate to answer.

‘It’s simple. My aspiration in life is to be happy.’
