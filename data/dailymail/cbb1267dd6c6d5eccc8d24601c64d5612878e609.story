West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace has called for the transfer window to be moved.

The Baggies chief believes it would be beneficial to clubs if the window closed before the start of the season.

But Peace knows a change is unlikely to happen with the Premier League reluctant to make the switch.

Astute: Jeremy Peace was happy with West Brom's transfer business but wants the window closed earlier

'If you spoke to the other clubs in the Premier League they would all say it's not ideal,' he told the Wolverhampton Express & Star

'We are all the same in our little league.

'My ideal would be that you get your squad done and start playing and the window shuts, then you all know where you stand.

Record signing: Brown Ideye was signed for a whopping £10m as the Baggies reinforced their forward line

'No player thinks that they might be moving and thinking they'd better not get injured.

'And players would not be coming to you saying they're not in the right frame of mind.

'We have raised it with the Premier League and said 'close the transfer window at the start of the season'.

'But they mention the League Cup, the FA Cup, no winter break, the fact that World Cups and European Championships eat into the window.

Star signing: Argentine international Sebastian Blanco became West Brom's 11th signing of the summer 

'All of these things mean we can't do it so we're stuck with it as it is and everybody has got the same set of problems.

'If we could do it I would certainly be in favour because it would remove a whole load of uncertainty during the season.

'You try to get things done as early as possible but you can't. People talk about not doing anything until after the World Cup.'

Albion brought in 11 new players, including record £10m striker Brown Ideye, as head coach Alan Irvine rebuilt the squad after they narrowly escaped the drop under Pepe Mel last season.

And Peace insists he is happy with the Baggies' business since during the summer.

He added: 'In a way we have had a major sea-change in the last three months because we wanted to draw a line under what had gone on last season and almost reboot it, start all over again.

'We have tried to get the right type of player in terms of not only the way they play but also the type of characters involved to take us forward.'
