Parents in the United States should vaccinate their children to prevent the further spread of measles, a leading autism research group has said.

In a statement, Autism Speaks said scientific and medical research had repeatedly confirmed that there was no link between vaccinations and autism, despite previous speculation.

The advice comes during an unfolding measles outbreak in the United States, which has so far infected more than one hundred people across 14 different states in the country.

Rob Ring, the group's chief science officer, told America's ABC News: 'Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism.

'The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.'

Authorities say unvaccinated children are putting the whole population at risk and leading to the reemergence of the disease. 

The outbreak renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines - fueled by  research since proved false that suggested a link to autism - have led a minority of parents to not have their children innoculated.

Dose: A vial of the measles-mumps-rubella virus vaccine, which is being distributed around the US to prevent further spread of the disease

Measles vaccines were first introduced in 1963 and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention declared the disease eradicated from the country in 2000.

But last year, the United States had 644 cases registered in 27 states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can be fatal in some cases. 

It is is one of the most infectious diseases known, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described it as the 'most deadly of all childhood rash/fever ilnesses'.

The myth about vaccines and autism began in a now debunked study from 1998, authored by Andrew Wakefield published in the Lancet medical journal

The Lancet later retracted the publication of the study, conceding that it was 'utterly false'.

It was later revealed that Mr Wakefield stood to gain financially from the study because he was involved in a lawsuit against the makers of the vaccine at the time of its publication, the Lancet said in an editorial at the time. 

Mr Wakefield subsequently lost his medical licence over the issue.

Another study which also claimed to find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was retracted this summer in the US after concerns over 'possible undeclared competing interests' of its author. 

The outbreak sweeping across the US is believed to be linked to Disneyland, where at least 40 people contracted the highly contagious virus last December after coming into contact with someone who had the virus.

The debate over whether vaccines work has also become a political issue in the race for the White House after potential Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie made an off-the-cuff rematk supporting 'a measure of choice' as to whether parents immunise their children.

That led to Hillary Clinton, possible Democrat nomination, to post a pro-vaccine comment on Twitter that read: 'The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let's protect all our kids.'
