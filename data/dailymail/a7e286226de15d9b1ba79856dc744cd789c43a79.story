A 61-year-old man has been charged with murder after a decade-long feud with his neighbor resulted in a fatal shooting.

Robert Moulton was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting of his neighbor Sergey Chepchugov, 41, on Sunday.

Moulton and his wife Deborah have been warring with neighbor Mr Chepchugov and his wife for ten years, residents in the quiet suburb said, with police called to the homes 46 times in that period.

Robert Moulton appeared in court with his attorney for a preliminary hearing on Monday after he was charged with second-degree murder

Deborah Moulton's sister, Darla, told WINK News that the fight started over the Moultons' dog with Chepchugov leaping over the fence into his neighbor's yard.

According to Naples News, Mrs Moulton told a police dispatcher on Sunday around 9pm: 'I told you you'd have a bloodbath.'

She said that Chepchugov had come into their yard and her husband had shot him.

After the shooting, the Moultons barricaded themselves in their home for several hours before a  SWAT team managed to coax them out.

Chepchugov, who owned a handman business with his wife, was pronounced dead at Naples Community Hospital.

Moulton is being held on half a million-dollars bail. He appeared in court on Monday wearing an orange jumpsuit. 

Chepchugov's wife, Olga Kolesnikova, had previously said that she feared for her life and took out a restraining order against Mrs Moulton in 2010. Ms Kolesnikova claimed that her neighbor went 'ballistic' over the Russian couple's boat that they planned to store in their backyard.

Ms Kolesnikova wrote in the petition that Deborah Moulton brandished a stun gun at her, according to Naples News. The court rejected the restraining order petition saying that there was not enough evidence.

In April 2010, the neighbors were embroiled in a dispute after two palm trees in the Moultons' front yard were cut down - and they suspected that those next door were behind it.

At other times, the two women said they were sprayed by the other's garden hose and filmed across their fences. 

Moulton was treated at hospital on Monday before being charged with obstruction at Naples jail. She was later bailed out by her sister.

Crime scene teams had blocked off both properties on Monday and were carrying out extensive investigations.
