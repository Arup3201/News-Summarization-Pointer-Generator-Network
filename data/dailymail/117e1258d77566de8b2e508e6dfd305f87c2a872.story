Police have charged a man following a series of explosions that rocked a street in Sydney's inner-west as investigations into the matter continue.

The explosions forced the evacuation of local residents on Wentworth Park Road in Glebe  and brought peak-hour traffic and the light rail system to a halt on Wednesday evening.

Emergency services raced to the scene about 5pm after reports of an explosion and fire at the public housing apartment block.

They are now searching for a 32-year-old male resident of one of the units on Wentworth Park Road

On Thursday morning, police took a 32-year-old man into custody after he was located outside a cafe on Abercrombie Street in Redfern about 9.30am.

He was charged with a revocation of parole warrant and possession of a prohibited drug.

The man remains in custody and will appear at Central Local Court on Friday.

Police said the man had suffered some minor burns to his hands but was otherwise uninjured.

Inspector Winston Pisani from Leichhardt Local Area Command told MailOnline: 'He had a number of items that can be used to make explosive devices.'

Inspector Pisani said police searched the unit and found multiple gas cylinders and other ordinary household items that could be used to make a bomb.

He ruled out the possibility that it was a drug lab.

'We're still investigating but it appears to be a gas explosion,' he said.

Inspector Pisani added that police believe he was at the unit by himself at the time of the explosion.

On Wednesday night, firefighters got the blaze under control and found items of concern that are believed to be linked to the blast.

Bomb squad officers removed gas bottles from the apartment.

Witnesses also described seeing a man fleeing the building seconds before the blasts.

Dozens of residents were evacuated from nearby homes but were allowed back in about an hour after the blasts.

Roads around the apartment block were closed and the light rail system, which crosses Wentworth Park, was shut down for a brief period.
