In scenes reminiscent of The Wire crime show, a desperate man has been caught on camera firing on a store owner and making a dramatic last stand against police.

Police say Carl Lastorino, 45, was gunned down after he refused to submit to two police officers in the East New York section of Brooklyn.

They said Lastroino pointed his weapon at them and shouted: 'You are not going to take me alive'.

So each cop fired a single round, hitting him twice in the chest. Lastorino later died at Brookdale University Hospital.

Police say Lastorino asked the man if he was 'Pete', then started firing a .38-caliber pistol at him

The desperate man had tried to escape in a taxi yesterday, but after witnesses on the street pointed him out, officers responding to the scene pulled the cab over, and confronted Lastorino.

They say he had exited a tyre shop on Linden Blvd 11 minutes earlier, where he took several shots at merchant Peter Argentina, 49.

Mr Argentina was struck in the hand and shoulder, according to the New York Daily News, but he likely saved himself by holding his hand in front of his body and by his quick feet.

When the shots started ringing out, he ran deep into the shop, down a maze of tires.

He told police he was 'trying to run serpentine, but I ran out of room'.

Fleeing: Peter Argentina, 49, narrowly escaped alive, after running down a maze of tyres. He suffered injuries only to his hand and shoulder

Hot pursuit: The shooter fires several more times at Mr Argentina, but he got away. Police say Lastorino fled the shop, but was stopped by two officers eleven minutes later, where he was shot and killed

Police say Mr Argentina may have affiliations with the Luchese crime family.

They said although Lastorino wasn't a member of the Luchese, his father Frank Lastorino Sr., was, and had been sent to prison in 1993 for conspiracy to commit murder.

Police say Lastorino's brother is also in the Mob.

But instead of appearing like an orchestrated act of mob violence, police say they think Lastorino acted alone.

Final moment: As a police officer can be seen approaching through the rear window, Lastrorino hesitates a moment. He then steps outside, and police say he shouted he wouldn't be taken alive, then pointed his gun

It may have been a final desperate act of a suicidal man, since police say they found several suicide notes left to his mother and sister.

Lastorino, who had been unemployed for three years, wrote: 'I can no longer live as a failure'.

And so he walked into the tyre shop around 4:40 p.m. yesterday, armed with two .38-caliber pistols, police say.Â 

He asked: 'Are you Pete?'

'Yeah, I'm Pete', Mr Argentina responded.

'This is for you, Pete', Lastorino responded, as he unloaded his weapon, police say.
