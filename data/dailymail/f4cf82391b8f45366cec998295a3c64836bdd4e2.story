As far as supercars go this might be the one to beat.

Labelled as quite possibly the most expensive car in the world, the gold Lamborghini Aventador has been spotted cruising the streets of Paris.

As fashion week starts today, the car - which is valued at around £4 million and appears to be from Saudi Arabia - was parked outside the Plaza Athenee palace hotel on the luxury Avenue Montaigne.

Sporting a distinctive 666 number plate, the gold-plated supercar appears to be the same one which has been turning heads in the French capital over the past few days.

Car enthusiasts have filmed the gold plated vehicle, which features a 6.5-litre V12 engine delivering 692 hp, driving through some of Paris's most exclusive streets.

The most impressive supercars, popular with wealthy playboys and mega-rich Arabs, are usually housed in the Middle East. 

But they are often spotted on the streets of European cities over the summer months, when rich Qataris, Saudis, Emiratis and Kuwaitis move away to escape the Middle East's baking mid-summer temperatures.

Even the brake callipers on the distinctive supercar seen in Paris over the past few days are gold coated

The vehicles - which act as a magnet for curious tourists and car enthusiasts - are tailor-made versions of famous models from car manufacturers such as  Lamborghini, Ferrari, Bugattis and Bentley.

Top speed: 217mph (350kph)

Acceleration (0-62mph): 2.9 seconds

This summer a striking gold Ferrari sitting on Sloane Street in London drew a few admiring glances. Among the other supercars spotted were a £2.5 million premium LaFerrari, £2 million Bugatti Veyron and £700,000 McLarent.

But the gold Lamborghini parked up outside the Plaza Athenee suggests that the supercar summer is not quite over yet.

Last year, a model gold Lamborghini Aventador went on display at a showroom in Dubai  to celebrate the manufacturer's 50th birthday.

The gold vehicle had a pricetag of $7.5 million, making it the world's most  expensive model car.

Carved out of a 500-kilogram block of solid gold, the finished model contained 25 kilograms of the precious metal. The model was designed by German mechanical engineer Robert Gülpen and sculpted from the same carbon fibre used to make Formula One cars.

 Mr Gülpen said: 'I wanted to do what no-one else has done before, to build a model car that is an "icon within an icon".

'I wanted to create a tribute to the legend of the automobile.'

The 1:8 scale replica of the Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 was just a prototype - for an even more extravagant model that will be cast from a block of solid gold.
