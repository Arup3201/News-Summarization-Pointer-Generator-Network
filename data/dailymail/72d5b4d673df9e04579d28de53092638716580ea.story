Thanks to beautiful celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Beyonce, who've perfected the use of Instagram and Twitter to share new images of their enviable faces and bodies, we're always on the hunt for new ways to perfect our own shots.

But for many of us, it isn't a case of 'I woke up like this', as a recent study revealed that women spend a total of 753 hours taking, deleting, retaking and touching up their selfies to look picture perfect - and it seems we may not be alone.

Certain celebrities and their all-too-perfect social media snaps have come under fire, with fans accusing them of giving themselves a digital do-over. 

And now, one reality TV star has called for fellow stars to go filter-free on social media - and she's retouched her own snaps to show how pictures can be enhanced with the help of an app.

Can you tell which image has been retouched? Ex On The Beach and Big Brother star Chloe Goodman has retouched her bikini shot, right, and pitted it against a natural one, left, to show how celebrities are digitally enhancing their social media snaps 

Chloe Goodman, 22, who found fame on Ex On The Beach and Celebrity Big Brother, told FEMAIL: 'I am sick of people commenting on my images saying I have digitally enhanced them. I am guilty of putting a filter on, which changes the lighting of the image, but I have never changed my body shape or retouched out any imperfections.' 

Chloe downloaded Facetune,  an app that lets you retouch your skin, body shape, whiten your eyes and teeth, and had a play around on a few images of herself to see exactly what others are up to.

'I actually think I look weird in the after shots,' she said. 'I think I look better before but that could be because I haven't got the hang of the app yet.

'It is so sad that we are in a digital age where this is even possible as it makes us all insecure when we see these perfect women on Twitter and Instragram.'

Chloe says that Beyonce is a prime example of this. 

In November last year, Twitter fans slammed Beyonce for what they believed to be a round of Photoshopped images.

The 33-year-old posted some racy selfies to her Tumblr while wearing a leotard printed with the words '99 problems but my a** ain't one'. Fans, however, called foul. 

According to Buzzfeed there was something fishy about how the curtains behind Beyonce's hips curve inward.

A month earlier, in September, the Halo singer was accused of Photoshopping a thigh gap into snaps of her on a yacht for her birthday celebrations.

And in yet another instance she was accused of altering a photo of her playing golf in a bikini in April last year.  

Chloe said: 'Beyonce changes her body curves a lot in images. It's sad to see possibly one of the most powerful women in the world, who claims to be a feminist, bowing down to the pressures of trying to look perfect in every single picture.'

She continued: 'There is too much pressure on young girls growing up in today's society with a fake impression of how they should look as they grow into a women. 

'The celebrities of our age who are on Instagram and Twitter are editing their images into better versions of themselves. This makes other women feel inferior and unattractive. This can lead to all sorts of problems for others including eating disorders, drastic plastic surgery and non-surgical enhancements.' 

Now, Chloe is pledging to hashtag all of her  images with #filterfreebyCG - and she's asking others with a big social media following, as well as celebrities, to do the same. 

'That way,' she adds. 'We aren’t fooling our followers. On top of that it would be great to see all women embracing their looks and hash tagging their images with the same.'

Kim often showcases her trim figure on her Instagram page via a series of selfies but it has been pointed out by her followers that her waist appears smaller in her selfie (left) compared with pictures later taken by the paparazzi (right)
