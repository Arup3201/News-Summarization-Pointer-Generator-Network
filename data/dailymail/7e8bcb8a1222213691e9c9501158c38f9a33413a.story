A student at Miami University in Ohio was shot dead by her ex-boyfriend just hours after she called police to ask them to stop him from coming to her home.

Rebecca Eldemire, 21, was found killed inside her locked bedroom at her off-campus apartment in Oxford on Sunday after her roommates reported hearing bangs and her fire alarm going off.

The body of 27-year-old Larry E. Tipton was also found inside. Police believe he killed Eldemire, known as 'Becca', before taking his own life, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.

According to their Facebook pages, the couple had been dating for a few years and were pictured smiling together as recently as last month.

On Saturday evening, Eldemire contacted Oxford Police to say that she wanted protection from her ex-boyfriend, Sergeant Jon Varley of Oxford Police said at a press conference on Monday.

Officers arrived and stopped Tipton in the parking lot of the apartment where Eldemire lived and on her request, they took him up to the home, Varley said.

'After a brief conversation, Eldemire told officers they could leave as they were no longer needed,' he added, and the officers left.

But at 8.45am on Sunday, her roommates called police, who arrived and found the bodies and one gun inside the room, they said.

An investigation is underway but Varley said preliminary results suggest a murder-suicide.

Tipton, who was from Columbus, was not a student at the university. 

Eldemire, a double major of geography and geographical information systems, had one parent living in Maineville and another in Columbus, as well as a brother.

Together: Eldemire, who started dating Lipton in 2012, had called police to her apartment on Saturday night to protect her when he arrived. But after speaking with him, she sent the officers away, police said

She worked as a student supervisor at the library, and had spent a previous summer teaching students English in a remote village in Tanzania, the college said.

On Monday, Eldemire's uncle, Stephen Wright, released a statement on behalf of her family.

'We are deeply saddened by the loss of our beautiful daughter Rebecca,' it read. 'We appreciate all of the thoughts and prayers, but ask that you respect the family's privacy at this time.

'The Rebecca C. Eldemire BEEPS (Betterment for Environmental and Earth Protection) Foundation will be created in her honor, striving toward Rebecca's lifelong goal of creating a more sustainable planet.'

Tipton's parents, who are often pictured with Eldemire on their Facebook pages, also released a statement following the deaths, WCPO reported.

'As you can imagine, this horrible tragedy has left our family in shock and absolutely heartbroken,' Larry and MaryBeth Tipton said in a statement. 'To lose our son, and also Becca, whom we loved like a member of our family, is unthinkable.

Scene: The next morning, her roommates heard loud bangs inside her bedroom and called police

Probe: Investigations are still underway but police suspect Tipton shot Becca before taking his own life

'We ask that our privacy be respected as we cope with this as a family and appreciate the prayers and understanding of our friends and community.'

Eldemire's death is the first homicide of a Miami University student in three decades, the Enquirer reported.

'This is a terrible tragedy,' said Miami President David Hodge. 'Our hearts go out to the families and friends. It is an incredibly painful and sad time for Miami.' 

Her funeral will be held in Cincinnati on Wednesday.

Her family has set up a foundation in her memory called The Rebecca C. Eldemire BEEPS Foundation - Betterment for Environmental and Earth Protection.
