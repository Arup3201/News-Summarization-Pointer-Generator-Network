Liverpool return to Merseyside on Tuesday after a 16-day tour of America which saw them win three and lose two of their five matches on US soil. 

It ended on a low with defeat to bitter rivals Manchester United in the final of the International Champions Cup in Miami but there were plenty of positives along the way. 

Here is what Sportsmail learned...

Ending on a bad note: Liverpool lost to rivals Manchester United in Miami in the International Champions Cup

1 Raheem Sterling truly is one of world football's most exciting young talents.

The fearless teenage winger was Liverpool's outstanding performer on the tour.

He scored against both Olympiacos and Manchester City, and tormented United during the opening 45 minutes before their second-half fightback.

Sterling, equally at home out wide or in a central role, now possesses the tactical intelligence to go with his blistering pace.

He scored 10 Premier League goals last season and looks capable of significantly improving that return to help Liverpool fill the void created by Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona.

2 Talking of special players, Liverpool boast another top class talent in Philippe Coutinho.

The little Brazilian was devastated to miss out on the World Cup finals in his homeland but that hurt appears to be firing him on to greater heights.

Coutinho's trickery and eye for a pass was a feature of the club's pre-season matches in the States. The only thing lacking has been a finishing touch.

Rodgers has revealed that the little Brazilian will be rewarded for his impact with a lucrative new contract to ensure Liverpool fend off interest from clubs across Europe.

3 Liverpool desperately need to sign another striker. Rodgers has been busy in the transfer market this summer with Atletico Madrid right-back Javier Manquillo set to be the club's seventh signing.

However, they still look short of firepower. Daniel Sturridge (hamstring) and Fabio Borini (shoulder) both left the tour early due to injuries and that left Rickie Lambert as the club's only fit senior striker.

Lambert is clearly still adjusting to life at Anfield and wasn't able to open his account – missing a penalty against Milan and fluffing a great chance against United.

Sterling and Coutinho will chip in but Rodgers needs someone who can guarantee him 20 goals a season.

Support: Daniel Sturridge is Liverpool's best striker but the club must replace Luis Suarez

4 There is absolutely no chance of Pepe Reina resurrecting his Anfield career.

The Spaniard joined Liverpool on the tour after spending last season on loan at Napoli.

However, he trained away from the main group during most sessions and wasn't even named among the substitutes for any of the matches.

With Simon Mignolet now the club's undisputed No 1, the writing is on the wall for Reina and Liverpool are desperate to get him off the wage bill.

His £110,000 per week salary has put off rival clubs with Napoli unwilling to match that amount and pay the £4million transfer fee. It's a situation Liverpool need to resolve quickly.

5 Rodgers' faith in youth is well documented and Liverpool boast another teenager who looks capable of lighting up the Premier League.

Jordon Ibe is exactly a year younger than Sterling and is on course to follow in his footsteps.

The 18-year-old has clearly benefited from a loan spell at Birmingham City last season and he was hugely impressive in the win against AC Milan in Charlotte.

He's quick, strong and robust – as demonstrated by the manner in which the Italians' rough treatment failed to disrupt him.

The question for Rodgers is whether to keep Ibe as an impact player this season or send him out on loan where his development would be aided by playing week in week out.

Bright future: Jordan Ibe looks to be the next talented player to come off the Anfield conveyor belt
