A central Kentucky firefighter injured in an 'ice bucket challenge' has died a month after a power line shocked him and another man. 

Father-of-five Captain Tony Grider was critically injured when he was helping the marching band from Campbellsville University, Kentucky, perform the stunt for social media.

The married 41-year-old had climbed into his fire truck's ladder with colleague Simon Quinn, 22, but got too close to nearby power lines.

Energy from the overhead cables transferred to the arc of the bucket and shocked the pair.

They were both airlifted to University of Louisville Hospital. Quinn was released on September 15 and is recovering at home.

Campbellsville fire chief Kyle Smith confirmed the death of the veteran today - who had been with the department for 16 years. He is survived by his wife Gena and his five children. 

A photo uploaded to Facebook by his colleagues included the caption: 'He had countless friends and he will be missed by so many.'  

Two other firefighters, Steve Marrs and Alex Johnson, were injured, but were released from the hospital. 

A picture posted by his colleagues on Facebook says: 'We will miss you friend'

Eric Johnson with Supporting Heroes told WCNC: 'It is with deep regret we notify you of the line-of-duty death of Campbellsville, Kentucky Fire Captain Tony Grider.

'Captain Grider succumbed to injuries sustained 30 days earlier when he received a high-voltage electric shock during an "ALS ice water challenge" at Campbellsville University.' 

Campbellsville University, a private college, is a Christian institution that has about 3,600 students, according to its website. It is about 65 miles south of Louisville. 

The ladder of the firetruck is seen collapsed on the ground following the tragic incident a month ago. Three other firefighters involved have recovered from their injuries
