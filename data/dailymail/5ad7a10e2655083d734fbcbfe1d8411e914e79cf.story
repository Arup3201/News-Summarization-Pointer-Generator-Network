A primary school named in honour of a Second World War hero who was killed in action is facing criticism after changing its name to shake off its 'association with failure'.

John Baskeyfield VC Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was placed in special measures in 2012 and then removed after becoming an Academy earlier this year.

As a result trustees decided earlier this month to rename it Saint Nathaniel’s Academy because they believed its previous name was associated with its own ‘legacy of failure’

But angry parents, historians and relatives of the gallant soldier - who sacrificed his life for his country 70 years ago at the age of just 21 - have hit out at the move and branded it an insult to his memory.

John Baskeyfield was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously in November 1944 for bravery during the Battle of Arnhem just months earlier in September 1944.

He died while single-handedly fighting off Nazi tanks after the rest of his regiment had been killed.

Baskeyfield fought with the 2nd South Staffs Regiment in North Africa, Sicily and Italy and commanded two anti-tank guns at Arnhem.

Having
 come under heavy fire from the Germans most of the regiment were forced
 back but Baskeyfield’s section dug themselves in and fought.

All his fellow soldiers were killed leaving Baskeyfield to man two anti tank guns to hold off the advancing Germans.

Despite
 his actions, by the time the Nazis sent a third wave of troops a German
 tank destroyed his position with a single shot tragically killing him 
in the process.

John Baskeyfield VC CE Primary School, in Stoke, has now changed its name to Saint Nathaniel's Academy

Trustees at the school have said they decided on the rebrand because they believed the school's name was associated with 'a legacy of failure'

The young 
soldier’s body was never recovered but he was awarded the Victoria Cross a few months after his death and a statue put up in his honour in Stoke-on-Trent 
in 1990.

His niece Joyce 
Windsor, 65, from Bradwell, today said: 'Nobody will remember him, 
everybody will forget and it will get pushed under the carpet. It’s a 
shame.'

She said: 'It was all done in his memory and now that has gone so it is really disappointing.  It is heartbreaking really when you think about it and we had no warning at all. I was quite taken aback.

'He was my father's younger brother and there were two sisters and another brother in total.

'I learnt a lot about him through the family so although I never met him I felt I knew a bit about him.

Baskeyfield's niece Joyce Windsor today said: 'Young people need genuine heroes to look up to and my uncle was the ideal role model'

'It just made you proud to think of what he had done and it was nice to know he is recognised. 

'It
 is a real shame the school has changed because now he will go from 
peoples' minds and people will just forget what John did. No one will know in a few years' time and that is a great tragedy.

'Young people need genuine heroes to look up to and my uncle was the ideal role model.'

Distant
 relative Christine Tilsley, 65, added: 'We have not got many heroes and
 it is good for children to have a sense of history.

'I was very proud of having a John Baskeyfield VC school. This decision is very silly and short-sighted.

'Instead
 of being associated with a VC winner, those children will grow up 
associated with a saint I have certainly never heard of - and I read the
 Bible.'

The young soldier's body was never recovered but he was awarded the Victoria Cross a few months after his death and a statue put up in his honour in Stoke-on-Trent in 1990

The school has now officially adopted the new name after being awarded academy status on March 1.

Defending
 the decision executive principal Chris Brislen said: 'The trust is 
confident the school is moving from strength to strength.

'We have come out of special measures by becoming an academy but the school has a way to go.

'To continue with the John Baskeyfield name would have continued with that legacy of failure.

'To have that legacy of failure associated with a local Victoria Cross winner wasn’t particularly good for him either.

'They have thrown away the memory of a local war hero. The new name means nothing to the children'

- Diana Coia, who has two grandchildren at the school

'We are a church school and the name reflects that ethos. We are in partnership with Belgrave St Bartholomew’s Academy.

'St
 Bartholomew is the name of one of Jesus’ disciples and Nathaniel is the
 name given to Bartholomew in John’s gospel so we thought it was a good 
name.'

Mr Brislen added the 
decision had also been made because some people thought the VC - which 
stood for Victoria Cross - meant ‘voluntary controlled’ instead.

But parent Rachael Meaney, 33, from 
Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'The kids all knew about John Baskeyfield and what
 he did for this country. He is Stoke’s proudest son.

'In
 such a poignant year 70 years since D-Day the children should be 
learning about that - not a saint that nobody has heard of.

'I’ve spoke to many parents and nobody really knows who Saint Nathaniel is.

'It
 is a disgrace to the memory of one of the city’s finest war heroes that 
he has his name and his legacy stripped away from the school.

'It’s callous and cold-hearted and his family must be devastated. John Baskeyfield would be turning in his grave.

'How on earth can you associate the name of a Second World War hero with failure? They have lost their marbles.'

Diana
 Coia, 50, who has two grandchildren at the school, said: 'They have 
thrown away the memory of a local war hero. The new name means nothing 
to the children.

'They need to change the standards not the name.'

The school was named after the lance 
sergeant who was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously in November 1944 for bravery 
during the Battle of Arnhem in September of the same year.

After
 initially becoming a butcher Baskeyfield was called up to the army in 
1942, joining the South Staffordshire Regiment and serving with the 2nd 
Battalion's anti-tank platoon.

The school's executive principal Chris Brislen said: 'To continue with the John Baskeyfield name would have continued with that legacy of failure'

He served in North Africa, Sicily and Italy before fighting in the Battle of Arnhem.

He
 was involved in the fierce confrontation near Oosterbeek, Holland, in 
September 1944, which saw most of the regiment being forced back.

Baskeyfield's section then mounted a serious defence of their positions, digging in near a road junction.

His companions were all killed, while he was also badly injured in the leg.

This
 however did not prevent him from bravely holding off the entire German 
troop single-handedly, in the hope of being able to attract the 
attention of nearby Allied soldiers.

The Germans renewed their onslaught and continued to attack the position held by Baskeyfield alone, as no help arrived.

He destroyed two armoured cars before a German tank destroyed his position in a single shot.He was killed in the process.

The Battle of Arnhem was part of Operation Market Garden, a bid by Allied forces to break through German lines and take bridges in occupied Holland.The operation itself was turned into a 1977 epic war film, called A Bridge Too Far, based on the book by Corenlius Ryan, starring Dirk Bogarde, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Laurence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins.

Local
 historian Fred Hughes said: 'I was very pleased when the school adopted
 the name of John Baskeyfield VC, it recognised and acknowledged as a 
tribute to the amazing story of a local hero.

'It is a pity that they feel the need now to drop that name.'

St Nathaniel’s Academy is a mixed school and has 420 pupils aged from three to 11.

Ofsted’s inspection in November last year revealed the school’s progress since being placed in special measures was inadequate and progress since the previous monitoring inspection was satisfactory.

Stoke-on-Trent City Council said the school was opened in 2001 as the 'John Baskeyfield VC Primary School'.

The Battle of Arnhem was known at the time as Operation Market Garden.

It was one of the boldest plans of World War Two and, if it had succeeded, would have ensured the war ended by Christmas 1944.

A total of 30,000 British and American airborne troops were to be flown behind enemy lines in September 1944 to capture the eight bridges that spanned the Dutch German border.

British tanks and infantry were to meet the airborne troops at the bridges and cross them.

The Battle of Arnhem was one of the boldest plans of World War Two and, if it had succeeded, would have ensured the war ended by Christmas 1944

The plan was conceived after the D-Day landings in June 1944 by General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the British forces in Europe.

Over three days, the Allied airborne forces tried to parachute in, while tanks and infantry made their way to the bridges.

They were surrounded by German troops and were eventually forced to fight their way out.

Almost 2,000 British soldiers were killed and 6,854 captured - a disastrous defeat for the Allied Forces.

German artillery controlled the river and only 2,500 British soldiers made it out alive.

It would be another four months before the Allies crossed the Rhine again in early 1945.

The war dragged on for another seven months until September 1945.
