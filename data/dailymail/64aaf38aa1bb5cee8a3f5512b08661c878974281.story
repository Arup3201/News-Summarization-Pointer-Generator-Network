Migrants have cost the Exchequer £140billion since the mid-1990s – more than £22million a day – it was claimed yesterday.

A new study starkly contradicts Left-wing claims that immigration helps to cut taxes.

Think-tank MigrationWatch has responded to another study – given substantial coverage by the BBC last year – which purported to show that immigrants made a contribution of £25billion to the public purse between 2001 and 2011.

Migrants have cost the Exchequer £140billion since the mid-1990s, more than £22million a day, it was claimed yesterday. A new study starkly contradicts Left-wing claims that immigration helps to cut taxes

But MigrationWatch says it was based on ‘highly misleading’ claims and some ‘wholly unrealistic’ assumptions.

It says authors Christian Dustmann and Tommaso Frattini, researchers at University College London, overstated the likely tax revenues from migrants and under-played the amount they claimed in benefits.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: ‘Our report finally disposes of the immigration lobby’s oft repeated claims that immigration reduces our tax burden.

'The total cost is high and increased dramatically between 1995 and 2011, providing no compensation for the overcrowding of this island which we are experiencing, largely as a result of immigration.’ 

'The study by UCL’s Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration suggested that migrants contributed 34 per cent more in taxes than they cost in benefits and consumption of public services.

But the MigrationWatch researchers point out that buried in a table at the back of the report, the net fiscal cost of migrants between 1995 and 2011 – the full span of the study – is revealed to be £95billion.

But the UCL report used a much shorter period between 2001 and 2011, when Britain saw a huge influx of Eastern Europeans, to conclude migrants had made a net contribution of £25billion.

The figures were based on the assumption that the most recent arrivals contribute as much as long term migrants, despite being younger and on lower incomes.

It also assumed they paid the same amount of council tax and that foreign workers in agriculture and construction were paying the same in income tax as lawyers and accountants.

It assumed migrants were taking no more in means-tested benefits than the rest of the population, and they received no more in housing benefit than the UK average.

Using the same methodology as the UCL report but its own adjusted assumptions, MigrationWatch found that migrants in the period 2001-11 would have actually cost the Exchequer some £25billion. Over the longer period, from 1995 to 2011, they cost more than £140billion.

The MigrationWatch study is the second to put a major question mark over the UCL research.

Earlier this year Mervyn Stone, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at UCL, said the study was ‘obviously driven to make the case it claims to have made’.

Professor Dustmann was one of the academics behind the prediction that only 13,000 migrants from Eastern Europe would come after controls were dropped in 2004. In the event, more than one million arrived in almost a decade.

Last night he said: ‘The main criticisms by MigrationWatch relate to three points.

'The first and second points are unfortunately based on a serious misinterpretation of the methodology we have used in our work, which leads to fundamental mistakes that invalidate their calculations.

‘The third point has been already raised by other commentators in the past. We have responded to that point in much detail and show that it does not affect the basic conclusions of our paper.’
