Pablo Zabaleta was left raging after some 'shocking decisions' from referee Stephane Lannoy in their Champions League clash with Barcelona.

Manchester City were knocked out in the last 16 thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Dani Alves, but Zabaleta, who was sent off, says three key decisions did not go his side's way.  

Zabaleta felt that there was a foul in 
the build up to Barcelona's first goal, that City deserved a penalty and
 he insists he should not have been dismissed.

Off you go: Pablo Zabaleta was sent off for a second booking for disputing a penalty appeal with the referee

'It was very clear - Pique came from behind and made the tackle on Edin Dzeko, and the referee was only two metres away. He saw that very clearly,' said Zabaleta.

'It was also a foul against Dzeko just before Barcelona’s first goal. He held the ball and turned, and Pique had hold of his shirt, and the ref gave a free-kick to Barcelona.

'Sometimes in the game you are nervous
 because you are trying to get the result, and sometimes shocking 
decisions by the ref make you a bit angry.

'I
 don’t know why I got a red card because I went to him to talk in a good
 way. I was a little bit angry to him because he didn’t give the penalty
 but I was always respectful to him. 

'I am very frustrated at the decision 
because it was a shocking decision. I am disappointed but also very 
proud of the team because I think we played a fantastic game.'

Frustration: Zabaleta reacts after Lionel Messi's opening goal at the Nou Camp

Appeal: Lescott looked to have brought Messi down inside the area after eight minutes

Lannoy also missed what should have been a penalty for Barcelona, when Joleon Lescott fouled Messi in the first half.

The officials also wrongly judged Jordi Alba to be offside and subsequently ruled out Neymar's goal from his cut-back.

In
 the first leg there was controversy when Jonas Eriksson awarded 
Barcelona a penalty even though Martin Demichelis seemed to foul Messi 
just outside the box.

Ruben
 Cousillas was on the touchline for City on Wednesday night, after 
Manuel Pellegrini was punished by UEFA for his comments about the 
referee after that game.

Unfortunate: Barcelona wrongly had a Neymar disallowed for offside early on

In or out? Demichelis conceded a penalty in the first leg despite his tackle looking outside the area

No say: Man City's manager Manuel Pellegrini looked on from the stands as he serves his touchline ban
