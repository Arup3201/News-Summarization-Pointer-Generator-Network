She may be a well-known devotee of facials made from sheep placenta and gold flakes and be the proud owner of one of the largest Hermes bag collections, but Victoria Beckham has proven she's a down-to-earth girl at heart with her latest revelation.

The former Spice Girl, known for her immaculate style and beauty look, has revealed her secret beauty weapon; and the best part is you can snap it up at your local shop.

The 38-year-old achieves her perfectly smooth skin with a body moisturiser by Weleda, and while she may have all the money in the world, it only sets her back £5.95.

So THAT'S her secret! Victoria Beckham swears by Weleda's £5.95 moisturiser to keep her skin super smooth

Speaking to HELLO! magazine about her beauty regime, she said: 'The body cream I use is a really simple, inexpensive body moisturizer by Weleda.

'It’s really, really thick, and I slather it on.'

First introduced in 1926, Skin Food is designed to aid skin battered by daily stresses from poor diet to pollution so it's not wonder that city girl Victoria uses it.

And Victoria isn't alone in her love of the product.

Adele, Alexa Chung, Rihanna, Peaches Geldof, Helena Christiensen, and Erin O’Connor are also fans of the bargain beauty product.

Adele 
explained her reason for using the product. She said: 'Because I wear a 
lot of makeup when I’m working, I like to use Skin Food by Weleda 
because it makes my skin feel really replenished.'

Erin O’Connor added: 'I massage this into the heels of my feet, toes and elbows before a fashion shoot. It works really well to soften the skin.'

Fellow fans: Rihanna, Adele and Alexa Chung are fans of the cream which is designed with city girls in mind

Stila lip gloss:  'I love those Stila lip glosses, the ones that you twist and click. They smell and taste nice,' Victoria spilled

Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream

Chanel nail polish: 'I like Chanel, as it always does forward-thinking colors.'
