On the town: Liverpool University students enjoying a Carnage event with a Playboy v Bunny Girl theme

Police will today issue an unprecedented plea for moderation in drinking as they admit defeat in tackling Britain’s excessive boozing culture.

The country’s most senior officer responsible for fighting alcohol-related crime called for an end to the attitude which tolerates out-of-control drunkenness as ‘normal’. 

Chief Constable Adrian Lee also admitted officers’ efforts to combat booze-fuelled yobbishness and violence had ‘barely scratched the surface’ of a problem that is ‘blighting our communities’.

Last year, Mr Lee called for the installation of drunk tanks on the streets to mop up some of the mess caused by the UK’s failed 24-hour drinking experiment.

Today, he will say that despite officers’ best efforts there had been ‘few changes’ in 12 months. 

In a 24-hour period measured by Mr Lee’s own force, Northamptonshire, more than one in four incidents reported to police were related to alcohol.

He will also call for much tougher action against the alcohol industry, a clampdown on cheap booze and more action to combat criminals with alcohol problems.

And he will say: ‘But there is only so much progress we can make without individuals taking personal responsibility for their drinking.

‘Social tolerance for excessive drinking is far too great and it is considered normal to be so drunk that people are not in control of themselves.

‘This puts an enormous burden on police and health services and affects the service we offer to the public.’ 

This weekend will see a campaign of action against public drunkenness across the country. It could mean drunks being refused entry to pubs and clubs if they fail a compulsory breathalyser test.

A breathalyser scheme – which is in operation at student venues in Loughborough – will see anyone considered too drunk when they arrive at a venue turned away on the basis of their alcohol reading.

It is designed to tackle ‘pre-loading’, people drinking substantial quantities of cheap supermarket booze before going out on the town.

Elsewhere, officers will issue ‘yellow card’ style warnings to people who are drunk, who will then be forced to leave the town or city centre if they do not control their behaviour.

Officers will also visit schools and university campuses to give alcohol awareness lessons to both school age pupils and students who are beginning freshers’ week.

The police action was backed by academics who called for officers to set up ‘booze borders’ around city centres, refusing entry to anyone who is very drunk – or making them sober up.

Jonathan Birdwell, of think-tank Demos, said: ‘We need a tougher and smarter approach in those specific places that have big issues with problem drinking and where our current strategies aren’t working.

‘This includes giving drunk and disorderly people entering city centres a “yellow card” and denying them entry – or forcing them to sober up for an hour in a drunk tank.’

Twenty-four-hour drinking, brought in by Labour under Tony Blair, was opposed by the Daily Mail with support from senior police, ambulance staff and judges.

Supporters claimed the move would bring a peaceful, continental-style drinking culture to the UK.

But police have said round-the-clock opening had caused ‘significant problems’, and anyone put in a tank should be charged up to £400 a night, including a £100 on-the-spot fine.
