With a heated swimming pool, private cellar and three acres of garden, you might say this five-bedroom mansion is fit for a King.

And, if local legend is to be believed, the £1.2m property really is home to one of the greatest monarchs in British history.

According to those living in Caerleon, South Wales, this stunning house, which is encased by a 19th century stone wall, is the final resting place of the legendary King Arthur and his famous knights.

This five-mansion property in Caerleon, South Wales has gone on the market for £1.2m - and is rumoured to be where King Arthur is buried 

According to local legend, the famous leader and his knights are buried under a mound in the three acres of garden (pictured)

The house, known as the Mynde, is just a few hundred yards from the remains of the town's Roman amphitheatre, believed to be the setting for Arthur's round table

Historian say the king's final resting place is at Glastonbury Abbey, Somerset, while others believe he lies in a cave in Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

But the famous leader and his men are rumoured to be buried under a mound in the three-acre garden at the house in Caerleon, where he was chronicled as visiting on several occasions. 

To add to the folklore, the house – known as the Mynde – is just a few hundred yards from the remains of the town's Roman amphitheatre, which is believed to be the setting for Arthur's round table.

Chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth described Arthur as holding court at Caerleon in his Historia Regum Britanniae, written in 1133.

Legend says that the sixth-century leader, who helped Britons hold back Saxon invaders between 500 and 550AD, is simply sleeping until the day he is needed again by his people, when he will return to save Britain from its peril.

Until then, history buffs wanting to buy the property will be content with the fact the grounds are on the site of a Norman motte and bailey castle. The current owners have unearthed various Roman and Normal archaeological remains from the garden.

Although the property is steeped in history, ultra-modern development means there is now a swimming pool (pictured), a sauna,  a separate party room with a bar and a private cellar 

The building is also surrounded by a 19th century stone wall, built as protection by the local sheriff during the Chartist uprisings of 1839

As well as a huge, well-manicured garden, the grounds back onto the Celtic Manor Golf Resort, the home of this year's Ryder Cup

Despite being drenched in history, the owners have added ultra-modern touches to the home, meaning there is now a swimming pool, changing rooms and showers, sauna, and a separate party room with bar.

The house also comprises of seven reception rooms, as well as three acres of garden, which backs onto the Celtic Manor Golf Resort, home of this year's Ryder Cup.

Simon Riggall, from Lambert Smith Hampton Auctions, who are selling the property: 'This is the perfect house for a history lover. It's in a beautiful location, and is a perfect family home.

'It's certainly a unique property and we've never sold anything quite like it before.'

Thought to have lived during the late fifth and early sixth centuries, the original King Arthur (depicted right in a painting) is believed to have led the fight against the invading Saxons.

However, the King Arthur that many people are familiar with today – thanks to TV shows, films and stage productions – is said to be a combination of many different myths and legends that have developed over the last 1,000 years. 

Modern historians often equate him with King Alfred the Great, the Dark Ages ruler of Wessex who led the fight against the invading Danes, eventually stopping them in their tracks. 

Either way, according to medieval romances and the Historia Brittonum, Arthur was a great king who defended Britain from enemies both earthly and supernatural.  

Arthurian legend claims Arthur was the son and heir of King Uther Pendragon, and was believed to have born on Castle Island in Tintagel, North Cornwall.

Tintagel still exists in ruined form in Cornwall, although others have claimed that he was Welsh.

A sorcerer called Merlin is said to have taken a sword called Excalibur from the so-called Lady of the Lake for King Uther, but upon the King’s death, he placed the sword in a stone.

Merlin stated that ‘he who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.’

After the King's death, Arthur is said to have pulled Merlin’s Excalibur sword from this stone, proving his right to the throne.

The legend doesn’t specify exactly where this lake was and there is a debate on whether it was Martin Mere in Lancashire, the Lily Ponds at Bosherston, or Dozmary Pool on the edge of Bodmin Moor.

The latter is closest to the supposed birthplace in Cornwall.

Legend continues that during his reign, in the kingdom of Camelot, King Arthur met with his knights at a Round Table, journeyed after the Holy Grail and fought a number of battles using the infamous sword.

During the Battle of Camlann, in approximately 537, King Arthur was killed and his body was sent to the Isle of Avalon. Historians believe this area was Glastonbury and the Somerset levels.

But there are other theories that King Arthur is buried on Mount Etna, the Eildon Hills in Roxburghshire or a cave in Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

Later, legend expanded the story and claimed upon Arthur's death, the sword was returned to the Lady of the Lake.

Early written accounts of the Arthurian story appeared in 1130 in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain where he claimed Merlin had the 15-year-old Arthur crowned at nearby Silchester, in Reading.

Legend also says that the king could be buried at Glastonbury Abbey, Somerset, (left) or even Mount Etna, Sicily (right)

The first mention of the Round Table, however, was in Robert Wace's Roman de Brut in 1155. This book claimed the round table was a wedding gift to Arthur from Guinevere's father, Leodegrance and is now believed to be hung in the Great Hall in Winchester.

Arthur was said to have sat his knights on the round table so that none was ever in a position of power of importance.

Whatever the truth of the real King Arthur, one thing is clear. According to prophesy, King Arthur and his knights – who are currently 'sleeping' – will return to Earth to defend Britain at its moment of greatest peril.
