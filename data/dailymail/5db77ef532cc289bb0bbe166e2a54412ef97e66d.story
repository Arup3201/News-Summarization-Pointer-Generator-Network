When these homeowners decided to spruce up their 'shabby' Grade II listed home with a lick of paint, they probably thought that their neighbours would appreciate their efforts.

But Ann Kennedy and her husband Mark have learned the perils of a little DIY, after council officials ordered them to repaint their entire property because it is too pink.

The couple insist that their 17th Century thatched cottage is exactly the same colour today as it was when they bought it 12 years ago.

Before the £1,000 paint job had even dried officials arrived threatening legal action unless the 'unauthorised' work was re-done in a subtler hue

However, town planners at Teignbridge District Council disagreed and ordered them to tone down their pink paintwork after a complaint from a neighbour.

The row began in November 2011 after the couple's neighbours repainted their homes and they followed suit, giving their three-bedroom cottage a fresh new look.

They looked back at photos of their property from 2001, when they bought it for £130,000, and settled on a similar shade.

But before the £1,000 paint job had even dried officials arrived threatening legal action unless the 'unauthorised' work was re-done in a more subtle hue.

Retired dance teacher Ann, 64, who has three grown-up children, applied for retrospective planning permission from Teignbridge District Council.

But the authority has denied her request and instead given the couple of Kennford, Devon, three years to repaint the entire house.

Ann said: 'Everyone else had had their houses painted and ours was looking rather shabby. So we repainted it in its original colour - pink.

'Before the paint was even dry we had the council knocking on the door saying we had to change the colour. They said it wasn't in keeping with the area.

'I think they're totally wrong. It's a beautiful colour and it's been like that ever since we moved here 12 years ago.'

The council insisted consent must be obtained before any alterations are made to a listed building that are likely to affect its character or appearance.

A spokesman said: 'Teignbridge District Council's Planning Committee refused a retrospective application for the painting of a Grade Two listed cottage in Kennford.

'The cottage was white but was painted a pale pink 13 years ago. In November 2011 it was repainted a bright pink colour by the current cottage owner.

'It is this shade which is the subject of this decision.'
