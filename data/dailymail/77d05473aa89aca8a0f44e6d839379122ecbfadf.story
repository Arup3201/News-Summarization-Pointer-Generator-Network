Tory minister Matt Hancock was forced to apologise after retweeting a poem online which said the Labour party is ‘full of queers’.

The Business Minister insisted it was a ‘total accident’ and did not agree with the offensive comment.

Labour MPs called for him to be sacked, but fellow Tory minister Nick Boles, who is gay, leapt to his defence as ‘a bit of a queer myself’ to insist there was no harm done.

Business minister Matt Hancock was forced to apologise for causing offence after retweeting a homophobic poem

After writing his own limerick online about the Labour party, Mr Hancock was sent this one which he retweeted

He later deleted the offensive message and posted this apology on Twitter

The problems began for Mr Hancock when he wrote a limerick about Labour leader Ed Miliband, who last week forgot to mention the deficit in his conference speech.

Mr Hancock wrote:

'There was a young man called Red Ed

'Whose deficit ne'er entered his head

'He simply forgot

'He's losing the plot

'So I'm voting Cameron instead.

However, it attracted a response from an account called @InAFlap, which read:

'The party run by young Ed

'Is quietly going quite dead

'Bereft of ideas

'Quite full of queers

'‘No wonder the faithful have fled.'

Mr Hancock retweeted the poem to his 17,300 followers.

It attracted an angry response from Labour, with frontbencher Chris Bryant said he was ‘amazed’ that Mr Hancock ‘sends vile tweet about "queers"’.

He said Prime Minister David Cameron should ‘sack him now’. Labour MP Steve Reed added: ‘Is this how Tories really think.’

Skills minister Nick Boles came to the defence of his colleague, insisting there was 'no harm done'

Mr Hancock later deleted the message, insisting the retweet was a ‘total accident’.

He added: ‘I wholeheartedly disagree with offensive comment in the tweet & am incredibly sorry for any offence caused.’

Hours later Tory MPs came to Mr Hanock’s defence.

Mr Boles, the skills minister, said there had been “no harm done”. Writing on Twitter he said: ‘As a friend of Matt Hancock and a bit of a queer myself, can I just say: give the man a break. He goofed, said sorry, no harm done.’

Tory backbencher Conor Burns, who is also gay, said: ‘What a load of fake outrage about @matthancockmp tweet. As a colleague I know Matt hasn't got a homophobic bone in his body. Move on.’
