And the Golden Globe nominees are...

The Hollywood Foreign Press has announced the nominations for the 72nd annual Golden Globe Awards, a ceremony that has a history of predicting the movies that will win big on Oscar night.

Birdman - starring Michael Keaton as a has-been actor - squawked loudly, flying away with a leading seven nominations, which were revealed by actress Kate Beckinsale in Beverly Hills on Thursday.

Golden girl! Kate Beckinsale took the honor of announcing the nominees in Beverly Hills on Thursday 

Meanwhile, dramas Boyhood and The Imitation Game trailed with five nods apiece. 

Those two films led a Best Drama category that also included Foxcatcher, Selma and The Theory of Everything.

David Fincher's thriller Gone Girl earned an impressive four nods, including Best Actress in a drama for Rosamund Pike, Best Score, Best Screenplay and Best Director.

British star Rosamund - who won widespread acclaim for her part as Amazing Amy in the movie - will have to compete with Jennifer Aniston for Cake, Reese Witherspoon for Wild, Julianne Moore for Still Alice and Felicity Jones for The Theory Of Everything. 

Taking the lead: Michael Keaton's drama Birdman, about a washed-up Hollywood actor who once played the superhero Birdman, has been nominated seven awards 

Marion Cotillard, who has won many critics awards for her leading role in Two Days, One Night has been snubbed in the category.

Selma - starring Oprah Winfrey and David Oyelowo - had been ignored at the Screen Actor's Guild nominations a day earlier.

In the Best Picture, comedy or musical, category, Birdman was joined by St. Vincent, Grand Budapest Hotel, Into the Woods and — in a surprise — the independent British film Pride.

Strong category: Rosamund Pike's thrilling performance in Gone Girl has been recognized in the Best Performance by an actress in a motion picture (Drama) 

Defining role? Jennifer Aniston will no doubt look a lot happier than her character in Cake when she finds out about her Golden Globe nod in the Best Actress for a drama category 

Second-time's the charm? Golden Globe and Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon is up for her role in Wild 

One of the surprise winners of the day was Grand Budapest Hotel. Along with a Best Picture nod in comedy, it earned nominations for Ralph Fiennes as best actor, and Wes Anderson for screenplay and director.

Jessica Chastain - who was also snubbed at the SAG nominations - is recognized in the supporting actress category for her role in A Most Violent Year.

However, she will have to battle it out in that category with Patricia Arquette who has been also nominated for Boyhood.

Buzz: Patricia Arquette has been nominated for Best Actress in a supporting role (Drama) for Boyhood 

Will they crack the code? The Imitation Game has been nominated for a total of five Golden Globes 

Impressive: David Fincher's Gone Girl has received four nominations including Best Director, Best Actress, Best Score and Best Screenplay (by the book's author Gillian Flynn) 

Surprise! The Grand Budapest Hotel received a Best Picture nod in comedy, and nominations for Ralph Fiennes as Best Actor, and Wes Anderson for Best Screenplay and Director

Keira Knightley and Emma Stone have also received supporting nods, and Meryl Streep has notched up her 29th nomination for Into The Woods.

The nominees for Best Actor in a television comedy series are: Don Cheadle, House of Lies; Louis CK, Louie; Ricky Gervais, Derek; William H. Macy, Shameless; and Jeffrey Tambor, Transparent.

The for Best Actress in a television comedy series are: Lena Dunham, Girls; Edie Falco, Nurse Jackie; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Veep; Gina Rodriguez, Jane the Virgin; and Taylor Schilling, Orange is the New Black.

Standing out:  Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne have been nominated for their outstanding performances in The Theory Of Everything 

Her time? Julianne Moore has been winning critics over with her performance in Still Alice, and has been nominated for the role at the Golden Globes, as well as another nod for Maps To The Stars 

However, it was HBO who remained the biggest winner in terms of nominations, with their shows accumulating an impressive 15 nods.

Uzo Aduba was also nominated for her role as 'Crazy Eyes' in the popular Netflix show Orange is the New Black. 

The Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor in a musical or comedy are: Michael Keaton, Birdman; Ralph Fiennes, The Grand Budapest Hotel; Bill Murray, St. Vincent; Joaquin Phoenix, Inherent Vice; Christolph Waltz, Big Eyes.

The Golden Globe nominations for best television drama series are: The Affair, Downton Abbey, Game of Thrones, The Good Wife and House of Cards.

And the nominees are! Kate was also joined by Entourage star Jeremy Piven at the event 

Golden touch: British actress Kate looked stunning at the event in a floral-inspired ensemble 

Cheers! Kate Beckinsale, Jeremy Piven, actress Paula Patton and actor Peter Krause toast the nominations 

George Clooney will also receive the Cecil B. DeMille award on the star-studded evening. 

Last year, the awards almost mirrored the Oscars, by naming 12 Years A Slave as the big winner, and also handing out gongs to Matthew McConaughey and Cate Blanchett.

The 72nd annual Golden Globe Awards will be presented Jan. 11 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and airing live on NBC. 

Announcement: Kate was also joined by actresses Greer Grammer and Paula Patton on Thursday 

Celebrate: Kate certainly looked in the mood to party, despite the early call time
