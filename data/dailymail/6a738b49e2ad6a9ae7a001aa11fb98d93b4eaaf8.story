Goalkeeper Joe Hart insists England will not use the searing heat as an excuse at the World Cup.

Roy Hodgson's team take on Italy in their opening game in the city of Manaus, in the Amazon jungle.

But training camps in Portugal and Miami will help the squad acclimatise to warmer conditions and Hart said it is up to the players to cope with them.

No excuses: England goalkeeper Joe Hart says Roy Hodgson's squad complain about the weather in Brazil at this summer's World Cup

Preparation: Hart, Danny Welbeck and Fraser Forster will fly to Portugal for an England training camp on Monday

Moving on: Hart will not be using Manchester City's title win as inspiration in Brazil

'It's going to be hot out there, we're 
just going to have to deal with it,' the Manchester City keeper said in a
 question and answer session with fans on the Vauxhall England Football 
Facebook page.

'Training in Portugal and Miami will help us prepare. No excuses when we're out there, it's only weather.'

Danny Welbeck backed up Hart's opinion, adding: 'Both teams will have to deal with it (the heat).'

Hart also claimed he is already over the excitement of City's Barclays Premier League title success and focused fully on the World Cup.

Hart helped City clinch their second Premier League crown in three years on the final day of the season.

'The Premier League thing finished last Monday after the (victory) parade,' Hart said.

'It's on to the World Cup now. I'm an England player, part of a really good squad with some great talent, that's what's going to give me belief in the tournament.'

Asked if England could go all the way in Brazil, Hart, who attended the England Footballers Foundation charity dinner with the rest of the squad, added: 'Why not? We are all winners.

'I am going to go there with my attitude 
to try and win every game and if you win every game you win the World 
Cup. You can't go in accepting failure or defeat.'

Hodgson's side have a tough group, though, with Luis Suarez's Uruguay also in their pool along with Costa Rica.

Keeper Fraser Forster said: 'Italy and Uruguay are going to be very tough, but all the games in the group will be hard. With the climate as well it's not straightforward.'

The Celtic stopper beat off competition from Norwich's John Ruddy to earn a place in Hodgson's squad - something he won't be forgetting in a hurry.

On receiving the news that he'd be heading to Brazil, Forster said: 'It's something special, a once in a lifetime 
opportunity.

Buzzing: Celtic keeper Forster couldn't wait to tell his friends and family about his World Cup call-up

'We all got a text before the squad came out. I was sat staring at the 
phone. It was a very special moment and it great to tell my friends and family. I'll 
remember it forever.'

Youngsters Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw also made the Three Lions' 23-man squad and Hart is confident that all three players are ready for the World Cup.

He said: 'They've all been picked on merit and 
have been playing well for their respective teams. If you're good enough, you're old enough.'

The England squad, including injury doubt Phil Jones, will head to Portugal on Monday.

What impact will the inclusion of young players in the England squad have?

Welbeck: Introducing young players will help give the squad great experience in a few years. Whoever is in the team and around the squad will get massive experience.

Is there a country you're most worried about?

Hart: Everyone. They've all worked hard to get there. There are no easy games.

Which player was your inspiration as a kid?

Hart: David Seaman. He was an England legend. Peter Schmeichel was a big personality and won it all.

Forster: Schmeichel. He was fantastic for Manchester United. Seaman as well.

Welbeck: Ryan Giggs and Thierry Henry. Michael Owen for England.
