Jailed: Jeremy Bamber is taken away by police after his murder trial in 1986. His latest appeal bid was rejected today

Jeremy Bamber’s convictions for murdering five of his relatives more than 25 years ago will not be referred to the Court of Appeal, officials said today.

The notorious inmate, serving a whole life term for the 1985 killings, has always protested his innocence and claims his schizophrenic sister Sheila Caffell shot her family before turning the gun on herself in a remote Essex farmhouse.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission said that despite a lengthy and complex investigation, it 'has not identified any evidence or legal argument that it considers capable of raising a real possibility that the Court of Appeal would quash the convictions'.

The Commission said this was its final decision in its longest-running case.

Bamber’s latest request for an appeal was based on a fresh analysis of three burn marks found on his father and gunshot wounds on his sister which suggested they were not killed with a weapon fitted with a 'moderator', or silencer, which suppresses the sound of a gunshot.

His trial in 1986 was told he had shot his family with a weapon fitted with such a device which he had later removed.

Giving its reasons in a 109-page statement, the Commission said: 'Matters of pure speculation or unsubstantiated allegation constitute neither new evidence nor new argument capable of giving rise to a real possibility that the Court of Appeal will quash a conviction.

'Neither can such a real possibility arise from the accumulation of multiple unsubstantiated allegations.

'The Commission is satisfied that 
nothing in the submissions made by and on behalf of Mr Bamber or any 
issues raised in the recent documentary can, either individually or 
cumulatively, give rise to a real possibility that the Court of Appeal 
would find any of Mr Bamber’s convictions to be unsafe.'

Bamber was told of the decision in prison today, the Commission confirmed.

A spokesman added: 'This is a final decision and brings to a close the Commission’s current longest running case.

'The Commission has given due 
consideration to all the submissions made, old and new, before making a 
final decision on whether to refer the case to the Court of Appeal.'

Bamber, 51, is being held in Full Sutton prison in York and has been behind bars for 25 years.

He shot his wealthy adopted parents, 
June and Neville, his sister Ms Caffell and her six-year-old twin sons 
Daniel and Nicholas at their farmhouse in Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex, on 
August 7, 1985.

He was given a whole life tariff after being convicted of the murders in October 1986.

In 2009, Bamber lost a Court of 
Appeal challenge against the order that he must die behind bars. He has 
twice lost appeals against conviction.

His lawyer Simon McKay said his 
client was 'very disappointed' and considering applying for a judicial 
review of the Commission’s decision.

'He is obviously very disappointed but remains determined to carry on the fight to clear his name,' Mr McKay said.

'In my view the Commission have not 
applied the proper test for determining whether a case should be 
referred back to the Court of Appeal.

'To be clear - four independent and 
supremely qualified experts provided opinions that fundamentally 
undermined the Crown case against Mr Bamber and the safety of the 
convictions.

'The evidence was credible, 
inherently believable and gave rise to cogent admissible grounds of 
appeal that may have affected the jury’s verdict.

'This is sufficient for the case to 
be referred back - whether the conviction is in fact subsequently 
quashed is a matter for the Court of Appeal. The Commission may have 
usurped the court’s function.'

He went on: 'I will now be considering a judicial review of the Commission’s decision.

'In the final analysis, whatever the 
notoriety that surrounds this particular case, whatever the public 
perception, the law applies equally to Jeremy Bamber as it does to all 
of us.

'The fight to clear his name will endure until justice prevails.'
