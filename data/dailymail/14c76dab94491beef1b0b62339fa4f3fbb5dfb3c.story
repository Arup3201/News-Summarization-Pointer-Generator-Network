A few glasses of wine each week could ward off depression, according to a new study. 

Spanish scientists have found that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol, particularly wine, can be linked with a lower risk of depression.

Those who consumed two to seven small glasses of wine weekly were 32 per cent less likely to suffer from depression compared with people who never drank alcohol.

The study looked at 5,505 men and women aged 55 to 80 in Spain, who were involved in a research trial evaluating the effects of the Mediterranean diet on heart disease risk.

None of them had depression at the start of the study and all were light-to-moderate.

During a follow-up period of up to seven years, 443 people reported that they were diagnosed with depression.

Researchers said that light to moderate 
drinkers, who drank 5 to 15 grams of alcohol daily on average, had a 
lower risk of depression compared with people who didn't.

The findings, published in the BMC Medicine journal, contradict previous studies which have linked alcohol to an increased risk of depression.

Lead author Dr Miguel Martinez-Gonzalez from the University of Navarra in Pamplona said the contradictory results may be because the result did not include people who previously had depression or a drinking problem.

‘Moderate consumption of wine may reduce the incidence of depression, while heavy drinkers seem to be at higher risk,’ concluded the study.

An alternative explanation, added the study, is that people who drank moderately also had better overall health which lowered the risk of depression.
