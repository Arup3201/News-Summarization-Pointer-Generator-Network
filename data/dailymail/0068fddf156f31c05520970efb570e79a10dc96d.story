Young people should be prepared to take lowly jobs in coffee shops if they want to get on in life, the employment minister has said.

Esther McVey said jobseekers need reminding that they have to start at the bottom and work their way up, rather than expecting to walk into their dream job.

In an interview with the Mail, she admitted that young Britons are less prepared for the world of work than foreign migrants and need to learn the basics, such as turning up on time.

Realistic: Esther McVey said the young should remember they must start at the bottom and work their way up

But she insisted that those who want to work hard can succeed if they are prepared to learn the ropes and ‘be realistic’ about their abilities.

The most recent figures revealed  that 941,000 people aged between 16 and 24 are out of work, while 282,000 under-25s have been jobless for a year or more, the highest level since 1993.

Miss McVey, 46, vowed that tackling youth unemployment will be her ‘top priority’ but said that those looking for work have to be prepared to get a foot on the ladder before expanding their horizons.

Asked if they should be prepared to take ‘entry-level jobs’, she said: ‘Absolutely. You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area” or might even want to run a hotel in Dubai.’

Last year, more than 1,700 people applied for eight jobs at a new Costa Coffee shop in Nottingham, which paid between £6.10 and £10 an hour.

But the minister said many young 
people have unrealistic expectations about what jobs entail, and it is 
only when they start do they realise it can take years to become 
proficient.

She said: 
‘Everybody says, “That’s what I want to do,” but I think you’ve got to 
realise the hours, the years [needed] to be able to do that job. When 
you see your first piece of work and compare it with who you want to be,
 all of a sudden you realise what skills you don’t have.’

Preparation: Miss McVey, 46, claims it is her mission to better prepare school leavers for the work place

Employment ministers often court controversy with their instructions to the jobless to make more effort to find work.

Most famously Norman Tebbit has long been associated with the phrase 'Get on your bike and find a job'.

But the man nicknamed the 'Chingford Skinhead' did not quite say that.

The actual quote came in response to a question about urban riots which plagued places like Handsworth in Birmingham and Brixton in south London in 1981.

A young Conservative had asked whether rioting was a 'natural reaction to unemployment'.

The then-Employment Secretary told the Tory Party conference: 'I grew up in the thirties with an unemployed father. He didn't riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking 'til he found it.'

The remarks sparked a political storm, with Mr Tebbit accused of being insensitive to the difficulties of looking for work.

In 2010, Tory Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith sparked a similar furore when he suggested the unemployed ought to 'get on the bus'.

He cited Merthyr Tydfil in Wales as somewhere where people had become ‘static’ and ‘didn’t know if they got on the bus an hour’s journey they’d be in Cardiff and they could look for the job there’.

The Government plans to expand its ‘sector based work academies’ in the retail and entertainment industries – a scheme where young jobless people get six weeks training, a work-experience placement and a guaranteed job interview.

Miss McVey spoke out after Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith released figures earlier this week showing that the number of Britons in jobs plunged by 413,000 between 2005 and 2010, under Labour, while the number of working foreigners soared by 736,000.

The Employment Minister insisted that ‘nine out of ten jobs’ are now going to Britons, but she conceded that school leavers in the UK are underprepared for work and less qualified than many migrants.

Chris Grayling, her predecessor as employment minister, hit the headlines in 2011 when he branded it ‘unacceptable’ that high street chain Pret a Manger had shops staffed entirely by foreigners.

Asked whether young Britons can compete with foreign workers, Miss McVey said: ‘For a long time people have left school without the right qualifications even in English and maths, therefore they are at a huge disadvantage.

‘We have got to get our kids up to the right standard and aptitude so that everyone wants to take them on.’

The minister started her own working life  with a family firm on Merseyside after university and then made her name in television before setting up a business forum to help women start companies.

She added: 'You are dealt the cards you are dealt and you have to make the best of that. That is life.

‘It is about keeping going. It is about working hard. You can achieve wherever you come from, so long as you work hard and are prepared to give it a go.

‘People might say, “Where are the opportunities?” But at the same time you could say, never have there been more opportunities when you look at the internet, where you can have a global reach with whatever you do. You can start a business in your bedroom and have clients right around the world.

‘In the 18 to 24 year olds, more people are setting up businesses than ever before.’
