Becky Bell, 7, from Hartlepool, who died of brain cancer. Her parents have been told they will have to pay £650 a year to keep her untouched bedroom

The parents of a young cancer victim have been told they will have to pay more than £650 a year to keep her untouched bedroom when charges for under-occupied homes come into force.

The ashes of seven-year-old Becky Bell have been kept in her bedroom, which has been left exactly as it was when she lost her battle with brain cancer in January 2012.

But Becky's parents, Julie and Mark, were told the room at their home in Hartlepool was now classed as a 'spare' and that they must pay £56 a month from April.

Mrs Bell, 41, said: 'It doesn't bear to think about them calling it a spare room, it's Becky's room.

'It's not her fault she's not here anymore and to us she is still here.

'We don't want to be different to anyone else and some people may think a year is a long time but when you have been through what we have been through it isn't and we are still grieving.

'But the Government don't see that, they don't look at individual circumstances, all they see is the pound signs.'

Under the changes, both social housing tenants in employment and those in receipt of housing benefit will be affected by the bedroom tax if they are found to be under-occupying their homes.

From April households under-occupancy will see their benefits slashed by around £13 a week for one bedroom or £22 for two bedrooms.

Mrs Bell, who is currently out of work, and Mr Bell, 37, a part-time taxi driver are Housing Hartlepool tenants and receive around £40 a week in housing benefits.

With the introduction of the bedroom tax they will need to pay £672 a year for Becky's room.

Becky's parents visited their local MP Iain Wright to appeal for help.

Mr Wright described the circumstances as 'heartbreaking' and has sent a letter to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, expressing his dismay at the situation.

Mrs Bell, who is also a mother to Vicki, 24, and Mark, 12, added: 'It's not the money that's the issue.

'If we did have a spare room we would be more than happy to pay the money.

'But it's the fact that Becky's room is being called a spare room, that's what I can't get my head around.

'In our house we don't have a spare room, it's Becky's bedroom, everything is still there exactly how it was.

'We are not asking for the world but even if we were allowed another year to grieve. At this moment in time we are still grieving.

'But the Government don't think about the fact that every family is different.

'No two houses are the same but they don't look at that, they just think of the money.'

Hartlepool Housing said it was a unique and difficult case.

A spokesman added: 'We are very sad at the terrible bereavement that Julie and Mark suffered with the loss of Becky last year.

'We have recently been informing all tenants about the Government’s policy to reduce housing benefit to tenants with spare rooms. We have set up an advice service to discuss individual cases.

'The reforms have not yet been implemented and we finalising our proposals for a transitional discretionary fund which could be used in cases like this.

'There will be a number of cases in which the administrative body, the local authority, will look at individual circumstances and apply the reforms appropriately. We will work with Mr and Mrs Bell to ensure they receive the best advice and support.'
