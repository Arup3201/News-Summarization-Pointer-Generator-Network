Good Morning America is once again the No. 1 morning show in the land. 

The broadcast's bitter rival, NBC's Today show, had notched an edge over GMA during the Olympics, but that advantage seemingly evaporated with the games' end. GMA trounced Today last week, or the week after the Olympics concluded, by an average margin of 162,000 daily viewers, Nielson Co. announced Monday.

It must be the hair: The George Stephanopoulus-lead Good Morning America beat  Matt-Lauer's Today show last week by 150,000-plus average daily viewers

Today dominated during the Olympics with 1.5 million more total weekly viewers than GMA. Last week, however, GMA beat its rival every day but Monday.

The route hit its peak on Wednesday, or Aug. 15, when ABC's GMA notched a heady 517,000 more viewers than the Today show, Nielson Co. said.

Last week's figures represented a return to normalcy in the morning show wars. GMA had beaten Today each of the five weeks prior to the Olympics' start.

Last week started well for Today, as the show saw a continuation of its Olympics boost.  It notched 4.54 million viewers on Monday, Aug. 13, or 338,000 more than GMA. The show pulled out all the stops, organizing a series of concerts and visits by Olympians to keep up the momentum.

But GMA won the next four days even without co-host Robin Roberts, who returned this week from a medical hiatus, partly brought on by her medical condition.

Roberts has MDS, a blood and bone marrow disease. She is expected to be off for an extended period this fall after undergoing a bone marrow transplant.

Today's ratings edge during Olympics, perhaps, consisted of viewers who are not morning show regulars and retreated to their old habits after the games ended, Nielson said.
