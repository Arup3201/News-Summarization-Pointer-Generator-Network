It brings new meaning to the phrase 'bobby on the beat'.

This police officer decided to demonstrate his musical prowess for shoppers in Birmingham - grabbing a busker's guitar and breaking into an impromptu performance of the Oasis hit Wonderwall.

A crowd quickly gathered around PC Ian Northcott, 48, whose surprise rendition of the Britpop classic has been watched more than 50,000 times on YouTube.

'Noel would have been proud I hope,' said the West Midlands Police officer, who joked that he might add the track I Fought the Law to his repertoire the next time he decides to entertain the crowds.

'It was such a lovely day, everyone seemed happy, it just felt such a natural thing to do.'

PC Northcott, who has played the guitar for around 15 years, said his brief 'gig' on Saturday afternoon wasn't the first time he had teamed up with busker's in Birmingham.

'I’ve got to know a few of the city’s buskers and have joined them before to play,' he said.

'We are always looking for ways to break down barriers between the police and the public and this was certainly one of them.'

No stranger to performing, the police officer has also penned his own song - entitled Pleasure - to raise awareness of the plight of homeless people.

With the help of four colleagues, PC Northcott has set up Socks and Chocs, which provides socks, chocolates and sleeping bags for homeless people on Christmas Day.

'Last year we donated nearly 1,500 pairs of socks, over 800 bags of chocolate, 60 sleeping bags and 270 hats and gloves to the homeless in Coventry, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton,' PC Northcott said.

'We’ll be starting our collections for this Christmas in September.

'I was walking through Birmingham recently and was approached by a homeless man who needed money to buy a safe bed for the weekend.

'After I had tried to ensure he would use any money to actually buy the bed I explained our Socks and Chocs For The Homeless event to him.

'He said "Man, I would love a new pair of socks, they make such a difference".'

PC Northcott's unconventional approach to neighbourhood policing has the full support of his superiors on the force.

Chief Superintendent Clive Burgess said: 'Whilst neighbourhood policing is primarily about being highly visible in order to deter and detect crime - another key part of the job is to interact with the public and to provide a friendly, reassuring presence.

'It’s clear that many people, be they in the crowd at the time or watching on social media, enjoyed the performance and I’m sure the majority will agree that this really encapsulates the true spirit of neighbourhood policing,' he added.

Describing his passion for music, PC Northcott said: 'I like Fairport Convention - who I hope will do a version of ‘Pleasure’ for me - Jethro Tull and The Saw Doctors.

'I love singing Share the Darkness, Green and Red of Mayo by Saw Doctors and Hurt by Johnny Cash.

He added: 'I might just play ‘I Fought The Law’ next time - simple three chords - just right for a happy strummer like me.'
