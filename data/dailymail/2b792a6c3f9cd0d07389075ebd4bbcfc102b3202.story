Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao will come face-to-face next week for the only time before the week of their $300million mega-fight.

Having finally agreed terms to clash in Las Vegas on May 2, the rivals will hold just one press conference, in downtown Los Angeles on March 11.

Both men began their official training camps on Monday; Mayweather at his gym in Las Vegas and Pacquiao at Freddie Roach's Wild Card in Los Angeles.

The Filipino star posted a video of himself jogging after he had flown in from his homeland over the weekend. 

Pacquiao must do without legendary trainer Roach until next week as the 54-year-old is preparing for Zou Shiming's first world title fight  against Amnat Ruenroeng in Macao on Saturday.

But when he returns, Roach will shut down his gym to work on the game plan he has devised.

'I won't tell you what the game plan is because that will be very silent,' he told the South China Morning Post. 'The whole Wildcard Gym [in Los Angeles, where Pacquiao is training] will be shut down and we will work out Manny's best strategy and nobody will watch it.'

Mayweather will work with his father and uncle and has already booked the services of former opponent DeMarcus Corley as a sparring partner, according to Fight Hype. 

Corley troubled Mayweather in their 2004 fight but was knocked down twice before losing a unanimous decision.

Mayweather and Pacquiao had not met before they went to the same basketball match in Miami earlier this year.

Having exchanged numbers, they later met in Pacquiao's hotel suite to thrash out the details but an official announcement was not made for several weeks.
