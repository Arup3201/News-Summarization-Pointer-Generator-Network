Locked up: Kosovan Jeton Lama has been jailed for eight years after raping a young investment banker in broad daylight in the City of London

A Kosovan refugee raped a young investment banker in broad daylight in the City of London, a court has heard.

Jeton Lama, 25, stalked the 23 year-old woman as she walked home near St Paul’s Cathedral on the morning of Remembrance Sunday last year.

She tried to fight him off and run to her flat but was dragged back to the doorway of a pub in an alleyway.

Lama threatened to rape and kill her before forcing her to perform a sex act on him in full view of a CCTV camera.

He then calmly walked off to buy a doughnut and a newspaper before getting a tube train home.

Detectives arrested him three days later after tracking the use of his Oyster Card and managed to match his DNA to the scene of the attack.

The victim has still not told her family what happened and said in a statement to the Old Bailey of her shock at being attacked in the street by a complete stranger.

‘Before that evening I was in a good place, I was young and happy and in some ways I feel it has changed me.

‘I am left always looking over my shoulder. I have never felt more afraid in my entire life. Sometimes it seems like an ugly horrible nightmare.

‘I tried to think what I have done wrong but I know I didn’t do anything wrong. I think maybe I should have continued walking along the main road but it never occurred to me in those moments that something like this would happen.’

The victim had only recently started a new job and was on her way home from a Saturday night out with friends at around 7am on Sunday 11 November last year.

Lama followed her off the bus at St 
Paul’s and started pestering her as she turned into Ludgate Hill, 
telling her how he liked her hair.

‘He simply wouldn’t leave her alone as she was walking along,’ said prosecutor Neena Crinnion.

‘She was making it quite plain to him she wasn’t interested in engaging with him. She was becoming increasingly frightened and she was telling him to leave her alone but he was persisting in following her.'

At one point Lama grabbed her but the victim shouted at him ‘don’t touch me, leave me alone’.She then tried to get away from him down Carter Lane but he ran after her and grabbed her, putting his hand over her mouth to stop her screaming.

Lama told her: ‘If you scream I’m going to kill you. I just want to have sex with you. Stop screaming, you bitch. I’m going to f*** you so hard and then kill you.’

She tried to covertly ring 999 on her phone but he told her to put away the phone and started kissing her and groping her body under her skirt.

In a desperate attempt to escape she pretended she would take him to a quiet place nearby in the hope of getting help from someone on the main road.

But when he realised she was trying to trick her he pushed her into the doorway of the Rising Sun pub and demanded she perform a sexual act on him.

'I have never felt more afraid in my entire life'

Following the attack, he then walked off down Ludgate Hill to 
buy a doughnut and a newspaper from a newsagent before getting 
the tube at Temple station.

Detectives were later able to get a DNA sample from the scene.

Lama was arrested on November 14 after detectives worked out his normal route of travel and stationed officers along the route.

He pleaded guilty to rape in January this year and his letter of apology to the victim was given to the judge.

Sentencing him to eight years in prison, judge Sasha Wass QC said: ‘The victim was a hard working, intelligent and successful, young and happy woman. Her life will never be the same again as a result of what you did to her.

‘She made it absolutely clear she had no desire to have anything to do with you. What happened to her was the worst nightmare of every woman.

‘The entire episode has been seen on CCTV and the police should be applauded for their detective work in swiftly apprehending you.’

Lama, of Pimlico, southwest London, came to the UK as a child asylum seeker in 2003 and was taken in by a foster family in Linconshire.

In February last year he was fined £600 for assaulting his then girlfriend in Brighton by punching her in the face.
