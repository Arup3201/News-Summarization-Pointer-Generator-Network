For some of even the most experienced drivers, parallel parking might not be the easiest manoeuvre. And the pressure of being watched by other drivers can make it even worse.

But imagine having to pull of a high-speed parking move, using only the handbrake and the streeting wheel, to skid into a space with just five inches to spare - or 13.1cm - a gap shorter than the length of an average pencil.

However, driven on by brotherly competition, Alastair and John Moffatt, from Gloucester, managed to do exactly that when they beat the tightest parallel parking world record.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Attempt: John Moffat was the first to break the world record, which saw him speed up to the space in the Mini Mayfair

Stunt: He then had to use only his handbrake and steering wheel to skid into the space

Tight fit: The space was just five inches bigger than the car itself

Easy does it: John appears to have got it just right as he begins to bring the manoeuvre to an end

The brothers used their amazing accuracy and driving skills to beat the previous world record, held by Ronny Wechselberger, which measured in at 14cm.

Driving vintage Mini Mayfairs, each of the brothers attempted the stunt, watched on by the cameras and adjudicators.

They had to skid the car into the space in one go, without touching either of the other vehicles or a white mark which outlined what would normally be the pavement.

John, 31, was the first to break the record.

He told This Is Gloucestershire: 'When I broke the world record I was in shock.'

Alastair, his elder brother by two years, then matched the feat, once again after a number of attempts.

How close? The car just about manages to squeeze into the gap

Success: The car appears to be perfectly in place

Judgement: The adjudicators have to assess whether all of the rules have been adhered to

Nervous wait: John waits with his hands over his mouth as the judges decide on whether the record has been broken

New world record: The judges make their decision and John takes the record

He said: 'When I achieved it, all I felt was relief. The light was fading and I only had one or two attempts left so the pressure was on.

'The fact that we hold the world record together is great as we are very competitive with each other but John continually reminds me that he got it first.'

Their challenge was filmed in December for the new CBBC show Officially Amazing which features some of the funniest, most ridiculous, scariest and Amazing record attempts from around the world.

Another go: As the dark begins to settle, Alastair looks as if he might have been successful this time

What a fit: Alastair also manages to skid the car into the space and share the record with his brother
