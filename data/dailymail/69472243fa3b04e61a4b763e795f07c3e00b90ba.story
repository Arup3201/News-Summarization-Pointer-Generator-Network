Lesley Figgis is a Guide Dog puppy raiser in Sydney and is urging more families to get involved 

Urgent calls are being made for guide dog puppy raisers in capital cities across Australia as the demand increases in the run up to Christmas. 

Candidates need to have a fenced-in backyard, to live in a metropolitan area, access to a car and a lot of time to invest in the pups. 

Families who volunteer will raise the puppy from when it is eight weeks to 14 months old and they are then handed back to the Guide Dog Centre where they are then assessed for future training. 

The process of breeding, raising and training a puppy to become a Guide Dog costs more than $30,000.

Puppy raisers are currently needed in the all capital cities except Canberra and Darwin.  

Around 40 Guide Dog raisers are needed in the Sydney area alone and there are more than 30 people across NSW and the ACT are currently waiting for a dog. 

Lesley and Greg Figgis, from Woolwich, Sydney, are puppy raisers for Guide Dogs NSW/ACT. 

Mrs Figgis, 55, said: 'We decided to become puppy raisers because Guide Dogs NSW/ACT is such a fulfilling and worthwhile cause and the service a guide dog plays to someone who is vision impaired is so beneficial.

'Plus we wanted the joy of having a dog in the house – we’ve had dogs before and puppy raising is a great way to enjoy this.

'Personally I also have vision issues and a couple of years ago I thought I might lose my sight.

4. Families need to have a fenced-in backyard, to live in a metropolitan area, have access to a car and a lot of time to invest in the pups.

'I’m blind in my right eye due to an accident as a child and two years ago I lost the central vision in my left eye, which was really frightening. 

'But I’ve since had treatment and that has been a success but I don’t know what will happen in the long-term.

'After this, it prompted me to look into becoming a puppy raiser and I saw an article in the paper and applied. 

'Our first pup was Scout, who has since graduated as a Guide Dog but we’re temporary caring for her at the moment as she waits to be placed with someone who is blind or vision impaired. In May we received Essie, a black Labrador pup.' 

Every day 28 Australians are diagnosed with uncorrectable vision loss, including nine who become blind, these figures are set to rise by 20 per cent by 2020.

Barbara Bonfield with her beloved Guide Dog Samara who helps who live her life to the full everyday

Barbara Bonfield's life was changed when she became the owner of Guide Dog in 1993 having got by for over 50 years with little to no sight aids to help her. 

Mrs Bonfield, 70, from Penrith, west Sydney, was born with an unidentified degenerative disorder of her retinas and she has been legally blind since she was 12 years old.

She currently has a Guide Dog called Samara who helps her live an active lifestyle and do everything she loves like shopping, bush walks, volunteering and travelling. 

During her early years of growing up Barbara received no professional assistance available to manage her vision loss.

She got married to Allan and had their daughter and cared for her with no help. 

When Barbara got to 40 she decided she needed extra help and she got her first Guide Dog called Quella because her sight was worsening. 

Mrs Bonfield told Daily Mail Australia: 'Prior to having a Guide Dog I used my other senses to get around and also had a long cane for some years. 

'For a long time I didn't want anyone to know I was different, I got my first job in a factory when I left school at 14 and used my senses of touch and hearing to get around.   

'My husband calls it resilience and that is how I have got by. I have never been able to see people's faces and I touch everything all the time. 

'Looking after a baby is a very hands on type thing and I would wipe her face after she was fed and as she started getting around we when we went out together, I always put a harness on her.

'Until I reached the age of 40 I had never really been able to go anywhere on my own, I did sometimes go out alone but not very often. 

'I got my first Guide Dog 21 years and the independence that the dog gave me was just incredible, I never have a day when I don't think what a wonderful, brilliant animal Samara is.

'She is my fourth dog and makes my life so much easier.' 

Mrs Bonfield says it is very important for more families to come forward to raise the puppies in a 'normal family environment'. 

She added: 'I have been to quite a few puppy graduation ceremonies and the puppy raisers are like proud parents. 

'They think their dog is the best and it is just a very rewarding thing to do. 

'Some people find giving the puppy back quite distressing but the pleasure they get and doing something worthwhile compensates for the distress of losing the dog.

'It is such a worthwhile community service, without puppy raisers there would be no Guide Dogs and without them there would be hundreds of people who would have a more restricted life across Australia.'
