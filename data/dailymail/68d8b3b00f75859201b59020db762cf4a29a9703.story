A beloved grocery chain CEO who was ousted from the company by his cousin - causing a six week standoff between management and thousands of workers - has struck a deal  to return to the helm.

Arthur T. Demoulas has reportedly made a $1.5 billion offer to buy out the part of the New England-based chain Market Basket controlled by his cousin, Arthur S. Demoulas. 

When Arthur T. - whom employees likened to George Bailey in 'It's a Wonderful Life' for putting people before profits - was ousted by a board of directors controlled by Arthur S. Demoulas in June, workers refused to work and marched the streets in protest. 

'Words cannot express how much I appreciate each and every one of you,' Arthur T. said from the back of a pickup truck out the store's headquarters in Tewksbury, Masachusetts on Thursday morning. 'You are simply the best.'

He continued: 'As I stand here, there is very little that I could ever add to your brilliant work, your extraordinary display of loyalty, and the power of your enduring spirit over the past several weeks.'

For weeks, warehouse employees had failed to make deliveries to the stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, leaving shelves bare and costing millions in lost revenue.

But on Thursday, tractor-trailers bearing the Market Basket logo and laden with the tons of food it will take to restock the chain's 71 stores, pulled up to loading docks. 

Just hours before, Market Basket said that Arthur T. would be returning to the company and that he and his management team would handle day-to-day operations while the purchase is completed. 

The company's two current CEOs, Felicia Thornton and Jim Gooch, will remain in place until the deal is closed, the statement said. The closing is expected in the 'next several months'.

'All associates are welcome back to work with the former management team to restore the company back to normal operations,' Arthur T. Demoulas said in a statement.

'I feel like I won the lottery,' Market Basket truck driver Buddy Wemmers told The Boston Globe.

Gary Sessa, a front end manager at the chain's Tewksbury store, told WFXT-TV that company bakers came in at midnight after hearing the news and started baking cakes that say: 'Welcome back Artie T: Market Basket Strong.' 

In a joint statement on Wednesday, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan said: 'We are delighted that the parties have reached agreement on terms of sale and resolution of operating authority, so that employees can return to work and customers will once again be able to rely on these stores to meet their needs.' 

The uproar over Arthur T. Demoulas' firing prompted massive protest rallies outside the company's Tewksbury headquarters. After the company fired eight supervisors who helped organize the revolt, public support for the workers intensified.

Thousands of customers, as well as more than 160 mayors and legislators in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, signed petitions agreeing to boycott Market Basket.

The chain has about 25,000 employees and 71 stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. The stores, usually jam-packed with shoppers attracted by the chain's low prices, have had only a trickle of customers for weeks.

The company's new co-CEOs had repeatedly urged employees to return to work, but they refused and insisted on the reinstatement of Arthur T. Demoulas. 

Business analysts said the worker revolt was remarkable at a family-owned, non-union company - particularly because the workers were not seeking higher wages or better benefits, but instead were calling for the return of their former boss.

The workers credit Arthur T. Demoulas for treating them like family, keeping prices low and leading the company's success.

'You know the movie, "It's a Wonderful Life." He's George Bailey,' said Tom Trainor, a district supervisor who worked for the company for 41 years before being fired over the protests.

'He's just a tremendous human being that puts people above profits. He can walk through a store, and if he's met you once, he knows your name, he knows your wife, your husband, your kids, where they are going to school.'

Renee Mulhane, a part-time Market Basket employee in Tewksbury, said late on Wednesday she was hoping an agreement was reached so that she could return to the job she held for 13 years before being laid off two weeks ago. 

 'It has been inspiring the amount of support the public has shown' the workers, she said. The situation has 'been draining, but inspiring'.

In its statement, Market Basket said: 'All associates are welcome back to work with the former management team to restore the Company back to normal operations.'

Infighting in the Demoulas family has gone on for decades, but this was the first time the family's squabble had such a deep impact on Market Basket stores.

Market Basket stores have long been a fixture in New England.

The late Arthur Demoulas, a Greek immigrant who was the grandfather of Arthur T. and Arthur S., opened the first store in Lowell nearly a century ago.

Over the years, Market Basket became a favorite of frugal food shoppers. Today, the chain has 71 stores and about 25,000 employees.
