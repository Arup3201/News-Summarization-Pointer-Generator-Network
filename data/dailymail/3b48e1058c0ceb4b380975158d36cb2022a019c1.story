A cyclist has died after a police car struck him and backed-up over him say witnesses - before an officer exited the vehicle and placed him under arrest while he was 'spitting blood'.

According to those who saw the incident on Wednesday afternoon in Quebec City, Guy Blouin, 48, was intercepted by the police cruiser going the wrong way up a one way street.

The car allegedly hit Blouin, knocking him under the car and Quebec City police department issued a statement on Thursday morning to say they are fully cooperating with the investigation.

Packed away: According to witnesses the officers put the cyclist's bike in their trunk after the accident, only to replace it later

'They ran over the guy, the guy ended up under the car. For an entire 15 seconds; he was under the tire in a fetal position,' Alexandre Beaulieu told CBC News.

Beaulieu told reporters that after the initial collision he saw an officer exit his car, see Blouin was under the wheels, get back into the car and roll over the 48-year-old a second time.

Another witness confirmed this.

This witness, who said his name was Daniel, also claimed he heard police arrest the man on the floor, while 'he was spitting blood'.

Shocking: According to witnesses the cyclist was stuck under the wheels of the police car and seriously wounded

A third witness claims he saw police pick up Blouin and put him in the ambulance without letting paramedics place him on a stretcher.

According to the paramedics official account, Blouin conditions worsened on the journey to hospital where he later died.

Internal affairs at Quebec City police have said they are to interview witnesses and the officers involved.

It was also claimed the officers picked up the bike from the scene after the incident and place it in their trunk, only to place it back at the scene at a later time.
