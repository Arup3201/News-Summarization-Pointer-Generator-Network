Inter Milan remain keen on Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches.

The Italians want a defender and a striker in the January window and their shortlist includes Chiriches and Matija Nastasic of Manchester City while Arsenal's Joel Campbell and Fabio Borini of Liverpool are among the strikers they want on loan.

Chiriches wanted to leave Tottenham in the summer and has failed to settle since his move from Steaua Bucharest Romania when he turned down approaches from Roma.

The Romanian has made just two Premier League appearances under Mauricio Pochettino this season and is behind Younes Kaboul, Jan Vertonghen and Federico Fazio in the pecking order at White Hart Lane.

It's been a similar story for Nastasic this season after a series of niggling injuries and the arrival of £32million defender Eliaquim Mangala from Porto last summer.

The Serbian international is yet to appear in the top-flight and appears increasingly likely to leave the Etihad after failing to convince manager Manuel Pellegrini of his ability.
