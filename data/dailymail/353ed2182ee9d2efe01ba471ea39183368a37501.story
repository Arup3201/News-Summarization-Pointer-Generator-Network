Microsoft has been accused of alienating its female customers after providing a sexist note to gamers promoting the new Xbox One.

With the holidays approaching, the company released an online form letter for men to send their girlfriends in a bid to convince them the latest model console would be a good present, for the both of them.

The note 'We got your back,' began: 'Hey honey, not sure if you've heard but Xbox One is now available. ...I know, I know. You'd rather knit than watch me slay zombies, but hear me out on this. Xbox One is actually for both of us. Seriously.'

The note immediately sparked a backlash on Social Media, with critics labeling it condescending and heteronormative, according to the Daily Dot.

Female gamers highlighted they don't need a man to bully them into buying games and pointed out the company doesn't understand that women make up nearly half of its customers.

According to a recent USAToday report, some 45 per cent of gamers in 2013 are women.

Meanwhile, Wall Street Journal numbers 
show nearly 40 per cent of Xbox users are women. And the company has 
actually bragged about this in the past.

The letter lists five reasons why the girlfriend, who is interested in Tracy Anderson fitness videos, dancing and Skyping her sister, should buy her man, a gaming and football fanatic, the new Xbox, or at least allow it into the home.

The initial outrage prompted the company to revise the original note to make it more gender-neutral and less condescending.

Lines like 'You'd rather knit than watch me slay zombies,' have been replaced with 'You'd rather do your taxes early than watch me slay zombies.'

The approach was perhaps unsurprising given the boys club inside Microsoft.

According to a September Huffington Post article titled 'MicBROsoft,' nearly 80 per cent of the firm's employees are men, including seven of nine board members and all of the four people charged with finding Microsoft a new CEO.
