England paceman Jimmy Anderson said he was staggered that the Trent Bridge groundsman had produced a perfect batting strip for the Indian batsmen, as the tourists finished day one of the first Test in the driving seat.

After racking up 259 for four at the close in conditions more akin to Mumbai than Nottingham, Anderson said: 'We are amazing hosts . . . as bowlers we want our nicks to carry and for there to be a more even contest between bat and ball but our attitude was fantastic. The pitch is what it is and we can't do anything about it.

'We're probably as frustrated as everyone else is watching.

'But 
there's not a lot we can do about it at this stage, we have to stick at 
it and try and winkle out six wickets (on Thursday) if we can.'

Groundsman Steve Birks was contrite, saying: 'We wanted to produce a pitch with pace, bounce and carry but unfortunately it hasn't happened.'

Anderson took two wickets and there was one apiece for Liam Plunkett and Stuart Broad.

Opener Murali Vijay, who finished 122 not out for India, said: 'It's a good wicket. It's coming onto the bat really well.

'After
 lunch, the ball was 'reversing' a bit. Anderson and Broad got the ball 
moving a bit, but we expected that, so we are prepared.#

'We just wanted to get a good start for the team.

'Once you get the rhythm going, you know how to go about it - and I really enjoyed it.

'I just want to cash in on this opportunity in England. It's a big series, and something I dreamt of when I was young.

'Once you get set, I just want to make it count and capitalise rather than playing flashy strokes.'
