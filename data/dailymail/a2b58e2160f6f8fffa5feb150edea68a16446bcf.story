The Colorado teen accused of murdering and dismembering 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway as she walked to school has been described as 'intelligent and mature' by jail supervisors while now freshly charged as an adult.

Austin Sigg, 17, accused of abducting the fifth grader as she walked in the west Denver suburb of Westminster on October 5, will be moved to an adult jail cell after showing good behaviour a judge ruled on Tuesday.

Sigg had been held in isolation at a juvenile facility but the court announced his planned transfer with the teen described as quiet, taking his meals alone and often playing Sudoku.

Confessed killer: Austin Reed Sigg, 17, appeared in court on Tuesday where a judge ruled he will be charged as an adult in the murder of 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway in October

His lawyers had the option of asking 
to move the case to juvenile court, but Judge Stephen Munsinger 
said that the defense waived its right to.

If convicted as an adult, Sigg, who 
turns 18 in January, faces up to life in prison with the possibility of 
parole after 40 years.

A conviction in juvenile court also 
could have brought a stiff sentence. He faced a maximum of seven years 
there on each count, which could have put him in prison for decades if 
he were ordered to serve his sentences consecutively.

Defense attorneys have not said 
publicly why they did not seek to move the case to juvenile court. They 
declined to comment to the media, citing the judge's gag order.

During Tuesday's hearing, Munsinger 
also agreed to move Sigg from a juvenile detention facility to an adult 
jail at the request of state's juvenile justice system officials.

Murdered: Police say Jessica was abducted as she was walking to school on October 5 in the west Denver suburb of Westminster

From missing to murdered: The Colorado 
schoolgirl's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 
miles from her home on October 11, six days after she vanished on her 
way to school

They said Sigg is being held in an 
isolation cell that's not meant for long-term stays and requires 
full-time observation because the cell isn't monitored by video. The 
officials said he hasn't caused any problems, is respectful and spends 
most of his days playing Sudoku.

'I would describe him as very mature 
and very intelligent,' said Dave Maynard, who oversees six juvenile 
detention centers in the Denver area, including Sigg's.

Because of Sigg’s upcoming birthday 
Munsinger, also from Westminster, said the teen would have been moved to
adult jail after that date anyway.

His lawyers opposed the transfer.

'We very much oppose moving this child to an adult jail,' defense lawyer Katherine Spengler said.

Sigg attended the hearing dressed in a
green uniform jumpsuit and was shackled at his wrists and ankles. He 
had some whispered conversations with his lawyers, occasionally nodding.

Security was tight. Spectators were screened twice, and 10 deputies stood guard inside the courtroom.

Sigg also is additionally accused of attacking a 22-year-old runner, who escaped him in May.

In the abduction attempt, the 
unidentified young woman was jogging around a lake about a 
half-mile from the Ridgeway home when she was grabbed from behind by a man.

The 
attacker tried to cover her mouth with a chemical-soaked rag but she was
able to escape.

From that attack he’s charged with attempted first-degree murder, attempted kidnapping and attempted sexual assault.

Sigg is charged with four counts of 
murder, two counts of kidnapping, and one count each of sexual assault 
on a child and robbery in Jessica's abduction and slaying.

He's also charged with six counts of crime of violence.

Prosecutors said he confessed to 
kidnapping and killing Jessica and attacking the jogger. It's not clear 
if he has made any comment on the charge of sexually assaulting the 
girl.

In charging documents, prosecutors 
said Sigg acted alone in kidnapping, robbing and sexually assaulting 
Jessica. The robbery charge involved the girl's backpack and water 
bottle, which were found in another suburb three days after she 
disappeared.

The 22-year-old woman said she was 
running in a Westminster park when a man grabbed her from behind and 
placed a rag with a chemical smell over her mouth. Investigators have 
not said whether the rag was soaked with a chemical meant to subdue her.

Police arrested Sigg on Oct. 23. His mother told The Associated Press she called police and her son turned himself in.

Sigg's next court appearance will be a
motions hearing scheduled for Dec. 12. A preliminary hearing, where the
judge will decide if the evidence is sufficient evidence to go to 
trial, is scheduled for Feb. 22.
