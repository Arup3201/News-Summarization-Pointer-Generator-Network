'Is there anyone else you can call?'

For a group of friends in New Jersey recently, apparently not, after all three received DUIs after systematically following each other to the police station.

It started with 34-year-old Carmen Reatequi, of Whitehouse Station, who was pulled over by a patrolman for swerving on Route 22 East about 1.45am on Monday.

After a standardized field sobriety test, Rautequi was arrested and taken to Readington police headquarters, according to NJ.com.

Bad news come in threes: The arrest of one woman, 34, in New Jersey for driving while intoxicated lead to the arrest of the friend she called to pick her up, which then lead to the arrest of the third friend called to give both a ride

She was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol, failure to stay in her lane and failure to provide a vehicle insurance card.

Enter: Nina Petracca.

Reatequi then called a friend Nina Petracca, 23, of Dunellen for a ride, however she showed signs of intoxication while officers were explaining the potential liability form.

She was made to do sobriety tests in the lobby and failed.

Petracca was arrested for DUI, and a search of her purse revealed seven Vicodin in an unlabeled container, leading to other charges for possession and driving while in possession of a controlled substance.

Scene: Carmen Reategui, 34, of Whitehouse Station, was pulled over here, on Route 22 east at Route 523 in Readington, New Jersey, about 1.45am Monday

Enter: Ryan Hogan.

Later both drivers called Ryan Hogan, 33, of Whitehouse Station.

Police detected the smell of alcohol.

Hogan then also underwent a field sobriety test and also failed.

He was also charged with DUI.

All three were released into the custody of an adult, this one thankfully sober.

The trio will appear in court in January.

Perhaps bad news really does come in threes?
