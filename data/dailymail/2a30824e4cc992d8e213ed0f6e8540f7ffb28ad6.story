The cost of a cuppa is set to rise by 15 per cent after the international price of tea surged to its highest level in two and a half years.

The wholesale price of the highest quality black tea – known as broken pekoe 1 or BP1 – has leapt by 41 per cent since the beginning of the year to above 4 dollars a kilo.

The increase follows a fall in the crop produced in Kenya, which is the world’s largest exporter of black tea, because of adverse weather conditions.

Britain is a nation of tea lovers and is one of the biggest importers of tea

Production has been hit by a drought at the beginning of the year and some heavy frosts.

A severe monsoon season has also reduced production prospects in India and Sri Lanka, two other major exporters.

Kenya’s annual production this year is expected to fall to 360million kilos, which would be down by 17million on 2011.

The 41 per cent rise in wholesale 
prices could feed through to an increase of around 15 per cent at 
supermarket check-outs in the UK.

That would put up the price of a pack of 80 teabags from around £2.55 to around £2.95 ahead of this winter.

The price of tea has risen to a two and half year high

Kaison Chang, secretary of the 
intergovernmental group on tea at the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organisation, said: ‘Indications are that the price is going to go up 
pretty high.’

He said rising demand for tea in 
countries such as India and China, which are traditionally large 
exporters, has also fuelled the price rise.

‘The consumption level in China and 
India has been growing pretty rapidly over the last five years or so and
that has contributed significantly to the increase in prices,’ he said.

The biggest importers of tea – Russia,
the United Kingdom, Pakistan and the Middle East – have stocked up in 
recent months, traders said.
