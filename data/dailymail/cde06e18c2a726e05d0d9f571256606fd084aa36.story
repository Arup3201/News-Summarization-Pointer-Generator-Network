The northern Syrian city of Raqqa is at the centre of an intelligence gathering operation to find Jihadi John.

Dubbed the ‘heart of evil’ by Special Forces, it is effectively capital of the self-proclaimed Islamic State.

Raqqa, on the north bank of the Euphrates, is the headquarters of IS and base to leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

It is also where most of the 20 international hostages are being held – probably in a network of underground tunnels.

US drones and satellites are focused on the city. Every detail from surveillance images, electronic monitoring and human intelligence from within Raqqa is being poured over. 

But hostages are said to be moved regularly to different locations around the city and leaders rarely spend more than a couple of days in one building.

In the months since IS militants imposed Sharia law, thieves have had their hands hacked off and opponents have been crucified or beheaded. Music has been banned.

Smoking is now forbidden, women must wear the full veil and there have been reports of people being stoned to death. 

Even goats have had their genitals covered. It is said that if you are on the streets at prayer time, you risk your life. 

One resident said: ‘They banned the sale of alcohol, they tried to close cafes where boys and girls sit together, they banned street theatre, cinema, bright colours and forced women to wear Islamic dress. 

'They are the new dictators, just like Bashar al-Assad, but dressed in black.’

Islamists proudly described Jihadi John as a ‘serial killer’ last night as they gloated at the global wave of revulsion over his atrocities

Islamists proudly described Jihadi John as a ‘serial killer’ last night as they gloated at the global wave of revulsion over his atrocities.

One radical boasted that the three beheadings made better viewing than Dexter, the hit US TV series about the secret life of a psychopath.

The man, known only as Abu Shiddah, taunted security agencies working around the clock to identify John and track him down.

He tweeted: ‘Jihadi John got 3 confirmed kills. Kuffaar [non-believers] still ain’t caught him. 3 kills makes him a serial killer. Forget watching tv Dexter or 24.’

The comments were among a torrent of bile spewed out on social networking sites supporting the latest atrocity by Islamic State. Many fighting in Syria and northern Iraq begged the West to send in ground forces, using the sarcastic line: #bringbackyourtroops.

Others focused on Prime Minister David Cameron, saying his decision to return to Downing Street was ‘too little, too late’.

Chief among them was notorious firebrand cleric Trevor Brooks, a former acolyte of Omar Bakri Muhammad and Abu Hamza.

He tweeted: ‘What’s your next move, Dave?’ alongside a picture of a poppy-wearing Mr Cameron at a remembrance event.

Another Twitter user, Mujahid Miski, gloated: ‘#IslamicState sent another1 to hell.’

IS has lavished special privileges on foreign arrivals, giving them free accommodation in homes that local residents have been forced to vacate.

Shia mosques and Christian churches have been attacked and destroyed by the Sunni militants. Shops, their shutters emblazoned with the IS logo, are closed five times a day for prayer, and religious police prowl.

But remaining activists living in safe houses, whose website bears the slogan ‘Raqqa is being slaughtered silently’, are said to be providing vital intelligence, communicating via encrypted online messages.
