Police chiefs are wasting millions of pounds when buying basic kit because they cannot agree on the details - such as how many pockets a uniform should have.

The national spending watchdog found widespread disagreement between forces about what kind of high visibility jackets they prefer for their officers and how they like their handcuffs.

As well as disagreeing on many pockets a police uniform needs, forces also hold opposing views about what constitutes a good boot.

Police chiefs are wasting millions as they can't agree on basic details of uniform such as handcuffs, boots and hi-vis jackets

As a result of their lack of agreement, forces are not using their combined purchasing power to its greatest advantage, and some are spending much more than others on simple items, the National Audit Office has concluded.

In a report published today it reveals some forces are paying as much 400 per cent more than others for each high-visibility jacket.

The highest price paid by a force was £100 per jacket, compared to a unit cost of just £20 in others.

Astonishingly, the report found 20 different specification differences between high-viz jackets.

A spokesman for the NAO said these included whether it should be a heavy anorak or a lightweight cagoule, the levels of waterproofing and weight.

On handcuffs, forces differed on whether they preferred the steel finish or a black colour, and how the two cuffs should be linked together.

Some forces spent just £14 on a set of cuffs, compared to £43 in the most spendthrift constabulary.

Riot shields can be round, curved or long, interlocking and vary in weight and thickness. Some forces prefer shields with map holders and dog handling straps. They cost between £31 and £136 depending on the force.

Body armour varied in areas such as thickness and colour and in price from £203 to £410.

If forces could agree common standards on those five standard goods, they could save 25 per cent of their procurement budgets - or £1.6million a year, the report said.

But coming in the way of agreement was that each piece of equipment had at least nine separate specifications.

The report said: ‘Forces have found it particularly hard to agree common specifications for uniform, which they spent almost £8million on in 2010-11.

The auditors added: ‘If forces cannot agree on such areas, meaningful collaboration will not be feasible.

Margaret Hodge MP, chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘It is unbelievable that something as simple as a high-visibility jacket has 20 different specifications, with associated prices that differ by as much as £80.

‘Instead of focusing money on tackling crime, police forces are wasting resources disagreeing over how many pockets they should have on their uniforms.'

Forces are facing cuts in Home Office funding totalling £2.1 billion over the five years to 2015.

Together they spend £1.7billion on non-IT equipment every year.

The NAO said forces could save £2.6 million a year - up to a third of their uniform costs - by agreeing a common specification.

NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘Faced with the pressure to make substantial savings, it makes sense for police forces to examine the scope for cutting the cost of buying goods and services.

‘What is clear is that many opportunities for savings remain unexploited.

‘Agreement between forces on collaborative ways of buying and common specifications for equipment can deliver better value for money - but implementing this is a challenge where forces are used to doing their own thing.

Policing and criminal justice minister Damian Green said: ‘The NAO report recognises progress is being made. ‘The police are already required to buy vehicles, body armour and some IT through national agreements and we estimate forces will have saved £110 million by March 2013 through better procurement.’
