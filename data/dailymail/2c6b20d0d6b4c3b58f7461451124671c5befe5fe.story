Reading are in talks with former QPR forward Hogan Ephraim.

The 26-year-old had a spell on loan at Peterborough last season but is currently a free agent following his release from Loftus Road during the summer.

Manager Nigel Adkins will be hoping to add Ephraim to the signing of another former QPR player Anton Ferdinand, who has penned a two-year deal at the club.

Target: Reading are in talks to sign free agent Hogan Ephraim

Acquisition: The club signed Anton Ferdinand on a two-year deal on Monday

Elsewhere in the Championship, Wolves defender David Davis has joined Birmingham City on a two year deal.

And Leeds are looking to sign Catania defender Giuseppe Bellusci on a season-long loan.

He is due for a medical at Elland Road on Tuesday.
