It contains more than 3,000 calories and is stuffed with eight sausages, a kilo of turkey, masses of vegetables and a whole box of stuffing.

This is surely Britain's largest ever Christmas sandwich, and one cafe in Birmingham will give you a year's supply of bacon butties if you can wolf it down in under 45 minutes.

But is doubtful you would ever want to see another bap again if you managed to rise to the challenge.

Giant: The almighty Christmas bloomer, which a Birmingham cafe is challenging its customers to eat in 45 minutes, contains more than 3,000 calories and dwarfs a normal sandwich

Gut-buster: Chef Richard Hollis shows off the Christmas feast, which is about 16ins in length and has eight layers

The gut-busting bloomer, priced at £15, is packed with potatoes, sprouts, six carrots, the sausages wrapped in bacon, the turkey meat, stuffing, a whole jar of cranberry sauce - all wrapped in an 800g loaf of bread.

Not only that, the challenge comes with a boat of gravy, a 450g Christmas pudding and a pint-and-a-half of tea.

The owners of the B.E.S.T cafe in Erdington, Birmingham, Dominic Riley, 29, and Richard Hollis, 31, decided to come up with the idea in the spirit of Christmas.

Up for the challenge: Taxi driver Joe Conrad prepares to get stuck in but understandably looks intimidated when chef Richard Hollis presents him with a pint-and-a-half of tea, a Christmas pudding and a boat of gravy

Beast: Cabbie tries to get mouth around the butty, which is wrapped in a whole loaf of bread

Dominic said: 'We wanted to make a good challenge with food and so we thought we would do a twist on the traditional Christmas dinner.

'We serve bacon, egg and sausage type butties to a great bunch of customers and we thought why don't we give them a Christmas dinner butty?

'It takes around two hours to prepare so people need to order it in advance and there's the pudding and tea to have with it.

Tuck in: Mr Conrad prepares to eat the festive feast, which contains more than 3,000 calories

'Anyone brave enough to take up the challenge will get a free bacon butty every week for a year. Christmas is about eating a lot and this butty will make sure anyone is stuffed.'

Customer and taxi driver Joe Conrad, 47, was the first to try the jumbo creation but admitted he couldn't quite complete it.

He said: 'I couldn't manage it but I'm sure there will be someone out there up for the challenge.'

Mind-boggling: The artery-stretching sandwich contains enough ingredients to feed a family of four
