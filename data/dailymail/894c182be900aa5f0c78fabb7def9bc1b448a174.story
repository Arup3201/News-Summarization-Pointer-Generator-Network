Police in Pittsburgh have described a neighbor of two sisters shot dead in their home earlier this month as 'a person of interest.'

The 43-year-old man, who has not been named, was questioned for 12 hours on Wednesday night as his home next door to that of murdered sisters Susan and Sarah Wolfe was searched.

Major Crimes Lieutenant Daniel Herrman said in a press release that the man is now considered a person of interest in the case.

Susan Wolfe, 44, and her sister Sarah Wolfe, 38, were both found dead with gunshot wounds to the head in the basement of the home they shared after neither showed up for work, authorities said.

Police say one of the bodies was naked and doused in bleach and laundry detergent.

Police 
found Sarah Wolfe's car around 1:15 a.m. Saturday parked nearly a mile 
away.

Sarah Wolfe was a 
psychiatrist for Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, and Susan 
Wolfe was a teacher's aide at Hillel Academy in Pittsburgh's Squirrel 
Hill neighborhood.

WPXI reports that sources close to the 
investigation said the man knew both of the women and 'certain 
behaviors' caught their attention, including being in possession of a pair of sweatpants belonging to one of the sisters.

The neighbor was released without charge to his apartment, one of three at 703 Chislett St in East Liberty.

'After the interview and subsequent search of the residence, detectives 
accompanied the male back to his residence. The male is considered a 
person of interest.'

Police have stood guard outside the residence since the man returned to his home.

However, Stephen A. Zappala Jr., Allegheny County district attorney, said the man was detained 'to facilitate the investigation.'

'It's premature to call him a suspect,' Zappala said.

According to WTAE, police are also reviewing surveillance video recorded at a nearby Sunoco gas station shortly after the murders took place to determine if a man buying cigarettes is the neighbor in question.

WPXI reports that a witness saw the man throw a pen into the trash at the gas station that read 'Iowa State Rep'. A sister, Mary Wolfe, is an Iowa Democratic state representative.

Security footage taken throughout East Liberty showed the man in other locations making efforts to cover his face, including nearby where Sarah 
Wolfe's vehicle was found parked on the street about a mile from the home she 
shared with her sister.

Police also questioned a woman, who is believed to be the man's live-in girlfriend.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the man in question said Tuesday that he did not hear anything on February 7 to indicate a struggle.

A woman who identified herself as the mother of the man's girlfriend said he had gone willingly to speak to police.

He had recently gotten out of hospital, she said, and walked with a cane.

'He's just a nice guy, a very, very nice guy,' she said. 'He made some bad decisions when he was young, but that don't mean you pay for them for the rest of your life.'

According to WTAE, a relative told police that the man had been in the Wolfe sisters' home a few weeks before their murder, helping them move furniture and carry groceries.

Pittsburgh police Lieutenant Daniel Herrmann said they don't have a motive for the killings, and there were no signs of forced entry. Family members, most of whom live in Iowa, said they're still trying to figure out what happened.

Mary Wolfe's website says she is the oldest of eight children, six girls and two boys.

On her Facebook page Saturday night, Rep. Wolfe thanked friends, neighbors and colleagues for their support.

'We are so grateful,' she wrote. 'Heartbroken, but grateful.'

On Thursday February 6, Susan went to work at the Hillel Academy at the normal time - about 7:25 a.m. - and left about 5 p.m., apologizing that she couldn't stay late because she had an appointment at 5:30.

'[Susan always went to work] eager to start the day, greeted the children at the door, read them 
books while waiting for other children to arrive ... Her smile was 
infectious. She approached every day with optimism,' Dori Oshlag, the director of the center, said.

On Friday, when Susan didn't show up for work, Oshlag got nervous and began calling her house about 8:20 a.m. but got no answer. Text messages and emails also went unanswered.

'And by noon, myself and the staff and administration realized we had to 
make a difficult call to ask for help. The rest is history,' she said.

By noon, Oshlag and other friends who'd noticed the women were missing, started calling police. Authorities performed a wellness check just after 1 p.m. and found the bodies.

Each sister was pronounced dead at 1:48 p.m. Friday.

Each of the sisters had an excellent reputation amongst those who knew them best.

Sarah Wolfe's boyfriend, Matthew Bucholz, posted a note on Facebook describing his deceased girlfriend as a 'beautiful, brilliant funny woman who worked as a children's 
psychiatrist and was an old school riot "grrrl."...This whole thing is 
unimaginably sad.'

Authorities say they are not looking at Bucholz as a suspect in the murders.

Sarah Wolfe's former landlord described her as a dream tenant who often put her February rent in Valentines Day cards, and who baked cakes and brought them over to her house for no special reason.

'We were just so happy to have her,' former landlord Kelly Carter told the paper.. 'She turned out to be a model tenant and a model neighbor and friend.'

In November, Wolfe left her rental property and purchased the house on Chislett Street - where she and her sister were both found dead.

Shortly after moving in, Wolfe's house was burglarized, according to Carter, whom she asked for help fixing a broken window. Carter says she advised her to get a burglar alarm, although it's unclear whether she did.

'I 
really hope they find who did this. I can't imagine [Wolfe] hanging out with
 unsavory individuals. She's such a nice person that maybe someone got 
through,' Carter said.
