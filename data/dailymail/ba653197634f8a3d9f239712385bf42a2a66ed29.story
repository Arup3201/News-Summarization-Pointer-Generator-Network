British rock star Roger Waters has been criticised by Jewish groups after a pig-shaped balloon featuring the Star of David was released into the sky during a recent concert in Belgium.

The large black balloon appeared towards the end of the former Pink Floyd frontman's concert in Werchter, which opened his European tour.

As well as the Star of David, it also featured symbols of organisations and regimes from around the world.

The balloon has provoked a furious reaction from Israeli groups as well as fans from the concert.

As reported by ynetnews.com, Alon Onfus Asif, an Israeli living in Belgium, said: 'I had a lot of fun, until I noticed the Star of David, on the inflatable pig.

'That was the only religious-national symbol which appeared among other symbols for fascism, dictatorships and oppression of people.

'Waters crossed the line and gave expression to an anti-Semitic message, beyond all his messages of anti-militancy.'

Waters is a known activist and has previously pushed for the boycott of Israel.

He had planned to publish a letter asking musicians not to perform in Israel but recently said he was reconsidering his position.

Pink Floyd achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music.

They are one of the most commercially successful and musically influential groups in the history of popular music.

Founded in 1965, the band originally consisted of students Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright.

The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall are among their most critically acclaimed albums.
