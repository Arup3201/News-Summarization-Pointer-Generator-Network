It is becoming more and more apparent that Lindsay Lohan was destined to be a bad girl if you look at the example that has been set for her. 

With her father Michael having been arrested twice this week, giving him a grand total of six arrests under his belt, it is easy to see how Lindsay might have a very laissez-faire attitude towards the law.

And now the 51-year-old celebrity father has a fairly impressive collection of mug shots just like his 25-year-old daughter.

Just like dad: Lindsay Lohan has racked up a collection of five mugshots over the past four years (L-R) October 2011 (probation violation), September 2010 (probation violation), July 2010 (probation violation), July 2007 (DUI and Posession) and May 2006 (DUI)

Bad influence: Michael Lohan has a similar collection of booking photos (R-L) October 2011 (Domestic Battery), July 2010 (Domestic Battery), 2004 (Assault and DUI), 1997 (Probation violation) and 1990 (Contempt of court)

Michael began his criminal history back in 1990, when Lindsay was just four years old.He was investigated for insider trading and charged with contempt of court.

Sentenced to three years in jail, he was released in 1993 on five years probation.

In 1997, he violated his probation by travelling to see Lindsay out of state while she was filming in Napa, California and had been hospitalised for an asthma attack.The violation got him a further year in prison.

In 2004, he then got into a fist fight outside a party for his son's birthday and was arrested on assault charges. While awaiting sentencing he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle after being involved in an accident.

He then spent two and a half years in jail. 

In July 2010, he was arrested in the Hamptons for domestic abuse after he allegedly pushed his on-off girlfriend Kate Major over a chair and then kicked her in the head. The pair were engaged to be married at the time and Kate later dropped the charges.

However earlier this week, he was 
arrested again on similar charges after Kate called police in Tampa, 
Florida claiming he had become violent towards her when she refused to 
perform oral sex on him.

Shortly
after being released on bail, he was arrested again for violating the 
pre-trial terms set out by the judge stating that he was not to contact 
Kate, by repeatedly calling her - even when police were at her house 
taking a statement.

He then tried to evade police by jumping off a third story balcony, breaking his foot in the process.

He is currently in a Tampa area hospital under police supervision, and will be formally arraigned this weekend on charges of violation of a pre-trial condition, two violations of a domestic violence injunction, and obstruction of an officer without violence.

Lindsay, meanwhile, is due back in court on November 2 to find out whether she will be sentenced to jail for violating the terms of her own probation.

The Mean Girls star was arrested for the first time back in May 2006 for DUI after she ran her car up a curb and was found to be intoxicated. Police also found a small amount of cocaine in her car - she was just 19 years old.

Then in July 2007 she was arrested for a second DUI and booked for driving under the influence of alcohol, possession of cocaine and driving with a suspended license.

In August she was sentenced to serve one day in jail, 10 days of community service and given three years of probation.

Lindsay then failed to appear for a probation progress hearing in May 2010 and a warrant was issued for her arrest. Her lawyers posted bail and she was ordered to wear an ankle monitoring device, undergo random drug tests and attend and alcohol education program.

At a July 6 probation hearing the judge found her in violation of her probation after her SCRAM bracelet was triggered.

She was sentenced to 90 days in jail but only served 14 days due to jail over crowding.

In September of that year, her probation was revoked again after she failed a random drug test, resulting in a day in jail and then a three month stint at the Betty Ford Clinic.

In February 2011 Lindsay was arrested and charged with the theft of a necklace stolen from a Venice store in January.

It's all going to be all right: When he was released yesterday, Michael pulled a thumbs-up sign and grinned for the cameras. He had been warned by the judge not to contact Kate Major

Trying to escape: Michael is said to have violated the terms of his release by contacting ex Kate Major, but tried to escape and hurt his foot by jumping three storeys out of his hotel

She was sentenced to 120 days in 
prison, 360 hours of community service at the Downtown Women's Center, 
and 120 hours at the L.A. County morgue for misdemeanor theft and 
probation violation, to which she pled no contest.

Due
to jail overcrowding, Lohan served the sentence under house arrest, 
wearing a tracking ankle monitor, for 35 days between May 26 and June 
29.

On October 19,  Judge 
Stephanie Sautner revoked Lohan's probation, sent her to jail, and set 
bail at $100,000. Sautner told Lohan that if she wanted to avoid any 
further punishment, she must complete 16 hours of community service at 
the morgue before her next hearing, which is set for November 2, 2011.
