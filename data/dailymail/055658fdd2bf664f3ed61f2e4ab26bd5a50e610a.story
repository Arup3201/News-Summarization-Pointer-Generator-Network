Toyota has revealed its latest supercar concept - after giving it a virtual test drive in a computer game.

The firm used Sony’s Gran turismo game to tweak the design for its latest supercar, called the LT-1 before unveiling the real-life version at the North American International Auto Show.

Toyota even used the game to sell the concept car to the car firm’s boss.

Every aspect of the car can be seen in the virtual version - even down to the lights, and the handling is expected to be identical to the final version of the concept car

Gran Turismo is one of the longest running driving game series, and this year celebrates its 15th anniversary in 2013, having first appeared internationally in 1998.

The multi-award-winning franchise has been the most successful ever for PlayStation, and in 2013 more than 70 million copies were sold worldwide.

Various version of Gran Turismo have  been created for PlayStation, PlayStation2, PlayStation3 and PSP (PlayStation Portable).

‘We collaborated with the Gran Turismo team to develop a virtual FT-1 and it was used as a tool to pitch the concept to Akio Toyoda,’ said Calty Design Research Studio Chief Designer Alex Shen, who was responsible for the car’s look.

‘Before reviewing the physical model, he drove the FT-1 on Fuji Speedway in GT6. 

‘He gave us a thumbs up when he finished his virtual lap faster than his best time in his own LFA in real life.’

The firm also plans to make the car available to all players of the game for free from today.

‘Thanks to the amazing capability of the Gran Turismo game engine, gamers can enjoy a very real simulation piloting the ultra-high performance FT-1 on the tracks it was designed to master,’ said Kevin Hunter, President of Calty Design Research.

The car’s interior features a fighter jet inspired heads-up display positioned above the steering wheel and projected out ahead of the driver to keep the eyes focused on the road.

'On the exterior, ‘Function-Sculpting’ was our key term to imagine the FT-1 design,' explained Hunter.

'We wanted it to look as if it was beautifully sculpted by the wind while providing functional cooling to optimize aerodynamic performance…it gets your heart racing just looking at it.'

‘The deeply sculpted intakes and outlets have sexy, curvaceous surfaces and transitions,’ said Hunter.

‘This was our approach in creating ‘beautiful solutions to manage dirty air.’

The FT-1 also has a glass window to showcase the engine.

The firm has not yet revealed the specs for the concept car, but says it will be the 'ultimate enthusiast's car'.

Polyphony Digital, the firm who created the game, said it was a dream come true to test a real concept car before it was made.

‘It’s always been a dream of ours to have our automotive partners use Gran Turismo in exciting new ways,’ said Kazunori Yamauchi, creator of Gran Turismo and President of Polyphony Digital Inc.
