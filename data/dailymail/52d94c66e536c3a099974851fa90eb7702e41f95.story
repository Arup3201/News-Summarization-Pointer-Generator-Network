Main street retailer Kmart has released a hilarious new holiday advert, which stars five pregnant dancers twerking and thrusting their bellies to a hip hop remix of festive favorite Santa Baby.

The slightly bizarre ad, which was released on the company's YouTube page, showcases underwear brand Joe Boxer's range of cozy holiday loungewear and follows on from a last year's Kmart Christmas campaign, featuring six boxer-clad male models shaking their hips in time to Jingle Bells.

Clearly eager to repeat the success of the viral video, which has received more than 18.3 million views on YouTube, the retailer has taken the festive fun to a whole new level with this campaign, which shows each of the mothers-to-be showcasing some seriously impressive moves, emphasizing their big bellies with a series of twerks and thrusts.

Back-up plan: Kmart had to enlist two back-up dancers to wait in the wings in case one of the stars went into labor while filming

Clad in comfy-looking pajama bottoms, tight red tops and matching socks, the women first appear with their backs to the camera and are shown only as silhouettes, hiding the fact that they are pregnant. 

But just a few seconds into the campaign, the dancers turn into the spotlight and shake their rotund bellies at the camera, showing off their best hip hop moves, which, luckily, appear to have been unaffected by their pregnancies.

The quirky concept was not without its complications however; according to USA Today, all of the women featured were in the last trimester of their pregnancy, in order to ensure they had appropriately large bellies. 

But with just a few weeks to go until each of their due dates, the retailer had to ensure it had back-ups waiting in the wings, in case one of the stars went into labor while on set. 

Merry Christmas! The advert is the latest in a line of entertaining festive campaigns

Surprise! At the start of the ad, the women hide their pregnant bellies, before whipping round to reveal them

Since the advert was filmed last month, at least one of the women has given birth - and the rest are expected to go into labor before Christmas.  

To accompany the womenswear ad, which has already racked up more than 210,000 view since it was uploaded yesterday, Kmart also debuted a menswear version last month, which features five male models using their stomachs as drums on which they bang out a festive carol. 

The retailer uploaded the menswear advert on November 17 and it has since been viewed by more than 1.1 million people, many of whom have been quick to congratulate the retailer on its unique advertising strategy.

Controversy at Christmas: Last year's campaign, which featured six boxer-clad models, came under fire from some shoppers who claimed it was 'disgusting' and 'sexist'

'Love the ad, and love YOU Kmart! :) Always look forward to your Holiday themed commercials, keep it up!' user Justin Wallace commented on the Jingle Bellies video, while Abelinda Morte added: 'I like this even better than last years!'

Last year, Kmart faced criticism from some shoppers, who claimed the retailer's Show Your Joe advert was sexist and distasteful.

'You can forget me stepping into any of your stores. Pull that ad off the air,' one person wrote on the store's Facebook page, while another suggested: 'You should find someone to do better commercial writing.'
