David 'Bumble' Lloyd offers his observations from the ICC Cricket World Cup. This time the former England batsman talks wine, New Zealand nightlife and England's woes.

Things might not be going well on the field for England but you can’t be miserable in New Zealand. I even ended up in a wine drinking contest, ‘the battle of the bubbles’ in Wellington.

This was English sparkling wine up against New Zealand’ s judged by wine masters including Oz Clarke. Would you believe it was a victory for England! A wine called Wyford won the blind tasting from 24 bottles. Might be the only thing England win here…

Invited out to John Wright’s farm 20 minutes outside Christchurch. He’s got 70 cows and a sit-on tractor!

The former Derbyshire and New Zealand batsman and India coach is now an IPL mentor with Mumbai Indians and did he have some tales to tell. John’s got a fantastic cricket brain and was fascinating on what constitutes a 50-over team….

To walk round Christchurch now is an eerie experience. I went to the memorial service for the victims of the earthquake exactly four years ago that devastated this beautiful city and it was very moving to see people, arms round each other, who had obviously lost loved ones. 

You just cannot get your bearings in the city centre. There are portacabins set up as shops and even banks. It will clearly take a long time for this place to get back up on its feet.

England stumble on and they were quite pitiful to watch in their opening two matches. Having been there as coach I watch Peter Moores closely and he looks to be ageing by the day.

His biggest disappointment will be that England just didn’t compete against Australia and New Zealand. You feel powerless and shell-shocked in Moores position…

Went out for a beer with two of my local co-commentators Ian Smith and Simon Doull to what they said was a quiet spot in Wellington. 

It was called the Bangalore Polo Club and I’ve never been anywhere like it. Lively is not the word. It was full of bowls of monkey nuts and their party piece is for everyone to eat them, throw the shells on the floor and then the pigeons come in to eat them all up. I made my excuses and left….

New Zealand were all over England like a cheap suit and Brendon McCullum is undoubtedly the best captain in world cricket.

He doesn’t do funky fields. He just knows where to put the fielders for every batsman. And when he had done that and bundled England out he went after them as if he had a train to catch. They are serious contenders but how will they go against Australia?
