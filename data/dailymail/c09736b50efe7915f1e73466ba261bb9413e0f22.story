Manchester United's stars enjoyed a fantastic weekend, thrashing rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford to extend their winning run to six games, and consolidating their position in the top three of the Premier League in the process.

And after Sunday's win, the players took the chance to have a second Christmas party of the season, heading out to a bar in central Manchester to celebrate.

Wayne Rooney, the club captain and the player charged with organising both parties, led the way, as the United squad arrived at The Neighbourhood Bar in three buses.

Rooney, who scored the first goal in the 3-0 win over Liverpool, took to the stage to sing at the previous event, which saw the players out with their wives and girlfriends two weeks ago. 

The bar is thought to be booked out for the United squad until 2am, with Louis van Gaal's side not in midweek action the players have the chance to let their hair down. 

Earlier in the day the players had taken part in some hospital visits, meeting sick children and giving out presents.
