A woman has been found guilty of shooting up a McDonald's after bacon was left off her burger twice in 24 hours.

Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, faces at least seven years in prison after being convicted of firing a 9mm handgun through the restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan in the early hours of February 9, 2014. No one was hurt in the incident.

In court on Wednesday, she was charged with felony use of firearm, carrying a concealed weapon and discharging a firearm into an occupied building.

During court, the jury heard the in-car recording taken from the police vehicle located outside of her home while she was being interrogated after the shooting.

The recording captured Torres saying 'there was no reason' for why it happened, according to Mlive. She also said 'it was just dumb'.

Torres explained that she was not seeking to shoot anyone while at the fast-food restaurant, and that she legally owned the gun, but did not have a permit to carry a concealed weapon.

The charge against Torres for felony use a firearm carries at least two years in prison, while shooting at an occupied building and illegally carrying a concealed weapon carries up to five years.

A news report from February 2014 shows the window Torres allegedly shot after getting a burger with no bacon inside. During the first day of trial, her attorney said she shot the gun but did so accidentally

On the day before the incident, Torres had gone to McDonald's for a burger but was unhappy to find it did not have bacon on it, as she had requested, police said.

After speaking to the managers, they offered her a free bacon burger on her next visit, police said, and  after drinking at clubs with a friend that night, she took them up on their offer.

Sitting in the passenger seat, she headed to the drive-thru at 2am - stopping to chat up a manager at one of the windows before giving him her number, which later helped police track her down.

But when she and her friend received their order, she again had no bacon on her burger.

Torres pulled out a handgun and fired once, sending the bullet through the window and out the other side of the restaurant, police said.

Her attorney, John Beason, had previously said in court that the gun, which had no safety, went off accidentally. 

Torres' friend, Nydia Ray, who was driving the car, told the court her friend had not been upset by the lack of bacon on her burger.

She said she saw the gun after handing the order back and was in the middle of saying 'What the f*** is going on?' when it fired.

The server, Essence Lake, had walked away from the window when she heard the shot and saw the hole in the glass, she said, adding the bullet would have struck her if she had still been by the window. 

'We went back and forth screaming and yelling and then we pulled off,' Ray said.

The women went to Ray's home but not before a witness wrote down the plate number. Police tracked the women down 30 minutes later.

Grand Rapids Police Officer Patrick Loeb said Ray told him that her friend had been upset over the order.

She told him Torres said something along the lines of 'do you know who you're talking to?' before she fired - which Ray has since denied.

Torres will appear in court on April 21 for sentencing and remains free on a $50,000 bond.
