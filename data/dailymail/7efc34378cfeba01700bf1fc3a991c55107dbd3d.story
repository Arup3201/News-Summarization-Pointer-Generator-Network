Two southwest Missouri residents posed for a selfie with the corpse of their deceased friend after he died of a drug overdose, say police.

Chelsie Berry, 24, and Jared Prier, 28, have been charged with abandoning the corpse of Dennis Meyer, 30, whose body was found dumped on Route V last week.

Berry and Prier were identified after the photograph was posted to Facebook.

Deceased: It's believed Meyer died of an overdose of the painkiller Dilaudid, but toxicology reports have not yet confirmed it

According to the arrest  report published by The Smoking Gun, Berry said she had been driving around with Meyer in his car.

He decided to inject the painkiller Dilaudid as they sat in a McDonald's parking lot, after which he began acting 'crazy,' taking his penis out of his pants and saying 'strange things.'

Berry became nervous so called Meyer's friend Jared Prier, whom she'd met the night before.

By the time Prier arrived, Meyer had passed out, so Jared took the wheel and drove to Loves gas station where Berry went and bought a drink.

When she returned, Prier informed her that he believed Meyer had 'quit breathing,' she told police. She checked Meyer and came to the same conclusion.

Friends: Meyer (left) posted a series of pictures of himself and Prier (right), who have both been linked to a gang, captioned 'Me and my homie prier... I'd ride with him with or without a patch....'

High on meth: Berry told police that she and Prier had taken meth and were too scared of getting in trouble with authorities to take Meyer to the hospital when he stopped breathing

Berry told police that she and Prier were high on meth and Xanax and were worried that if they took Meyer to hospital they'd 'get in trouble.'

Instead, they dragged Meyer's body to the backseat because they no longer wanted to look at him and he had begun to smell - but not before posing for the selfie with their dead friend.

The pair then drove around the back roads looking for somewhere to dump his body, eventually driving down a long driveway in the early hours of the morning and pushing his body to the ground.

Newton County Sheriff Ken has said Meyer possibly died of a drug overdose. An autopsy has been performed, but authorities are waiting for a toxicology report.

The autopsy concluded that Meyer would have died slowly and his breathing would have been very shallow - meaning if the pair had gotten him medical attention he might have survived.

They have been charged with voluntary manslaughter and abandonment of a corpse.

The Smoking Gun reports that Prier and Meyer are associated with the Joplin Honkies street gang.
