American Airlines is trying to recover from a public relations nightmare after a massive technology glitch meant that its entire fleet was grounded yesterday, stranding tens of thousands of angry passengers.

Though the nation's third-biggest airline has promised to be nearly operational today, the hangover from yesterday's online reservation system meant that many travelers are still stuck in airports.

The company has employed the use of social media - especially Twitter - to do damage control, informing irate passengers on when they might expect to make it to their final destinations.

On Tuesday, American and sister 
airline American Eagle canceled 970 flights and delayed at least 1,068 
more by early evening, according to flight-tracking service 
FlightAware.com.

That means
American and Eagle canceled or delayed nearly two-thirds of their 
scheduled flights after they lost access to a computer system that's 
used for everything from issuing boarding passes to determining how much
fuel to pump into the plane.

Passengers took to social media sites to 
criticize the airline, which for hours could only apologize and say that
it was trying to fix the problem.

The man who will lead American in a 
few months, US Airways CEO Doug Parker, has said he would prefer to 
convert his planes and employees to American's computer system rather 
than the other way around.

US Airways declined to comment on whether Tuesday's breakdown would cause Parker to rethink his plans.

The computer outage began snarling 
operations around midmorning. Eventually the Federal Aviation 
Administration issued a so-called ground stop for American Airlines jets
around the country.

Flights already in the air were 
allowed to continue to their destinations, but planes on the ground from
coast to coast could not take off. And travelers could do little to get
back in the air until the computer system was restored.

By late afternoon, American resumed 
international flights and those from its major hub airports. It 
scrambled during the evening to put planes and crews in position to get 
off to a good start on Wednesday morning.

'Despite the magnitude of today's 
disruption, we are pleased to report that we expect our operation to run
normally with only a small number of flight cancellations' on 
Wednesday, said Andrea Huguely, a spokeswoman for American. She said 
American would add flights to accommodate stranded passengers.

American blamed the outage on a loss 
of access to computer networks that are used for flight reservations and
many other functions.

Airlines commonly rely on such 
systems to track passengers and bags, monitor who boards planes, and 
update flight schedules and gate assignments. The computers are also 
used to file flight plans and tell employees which seats should be 
filled to ensure that the plane is properly balanced.

American's system is hosted by Sabre 
Holdings, a one-time division of American that was spun off into a 
separate travel-reservations technology company. American said the 
outage wasn't Sabre's fault, and other airlines that use Sabre didn't 
experience problems.

At airports, customers whose flights 
were canceled couldn't rebook on a later flight. Passengers already at 
the airport were stuck in long lines or killed time in gate areas.

'Tensions are high. A lot of people 
are getting mad. I've seen several yelling at the American agents,' said
Julie Burch, a business-meeting speaker who was stuck at Dallas-Fort 
Worth International Airport waiting for a flight to Denver. 'Nobody can 
tell us anything.'

Terry Anzur, a TV news consultant 
from Los Angeles who was also stranded in Dallas, said American Airlines
gate employees were doing everything the old-fashioned, manual way 
because their computers were useless.

'No one at the counter can do anything. They can't check people in,' Anzur said. 'The airline is at a dead halt.'

Theoretically, an airline could do 
the same work as the reservation system manually for any one flight. But
doing it for hundreds of flights isn't practical. American and Eagle 
operate about 3,300 flights a day.

Now, if the reservations systems go 
down, 'most airlines would be pretty much without the ability to fly 
more than a very limited number of flights,' said Scott Nason, 
American's former technology chief and now a consultant.

Nason said airlines find and fix the 
problem, but the next time something else causes an outage. One time, a 
possum chewed through a cable in Tulsa, Oklahoma, bringing down the 
whole system. Another time, a worker in the airline's data center used a
metal tool instead of an insulated, rubber-coated one - a short-circuit
crashed much of the system, he said.

Brent Bowen, a professor of aviation 
technology at Purdue University, said massive system failures are 
inevitable as airlines grow increasingly reliant on technology.

'As those systems get bigger and more
complex, at some point you're going to have a systemic failure,' Bowen 
said. He added that financially strapped airlines may have underinvested
in technology during the past decade, making the computer systems more 
vulnerable. AMR has lost more than $10 billion since 2001 and filed for 
bankruptcy protection in late 2011.

American's problems on Tuesday were 
reminiscent of what United Airlines passengers endured for several days 
last year. After merging with Continental, United experienced computer 
glitches in the combined reservation system.

On one day in August, 580 
United flights were delayed, and its website was shut down for two 
hours.

Another outage in November delayed 636 flights.

The problems prompted an apology from
United Continental Holdings Inc. CEO Jeff Smisek, who acknowledged that
his airline had frustrated customers and would need to work to win them
back.

American began making amends by 
offering to book people who needed to travel Tuesday on other airlines 
and pay for the fare difference. For those who wanted to delay their 
trips, American offered refunds or waivers from the usual fee for 
changing a reservation.

But for several hours, the airline wasn't able to process those changes and refunds - because the computers were down.
