Austria's capital city isn't just home to the breathtaking Belvedere Palace, bustling Graben Street, and its famous Viennese coffee, it also has the distinct honour of being the world's most livable city.

Vienna has the best quality of living overall, according to the Mercer 2015 Quality of Living rankings, which analyses 230 countries globally.

Overall, European cities dominated the top 10, with Zurich, Munich and Dusseldorf leading the pack.

Vienna, ranked first both in Europe and worldwide, takes top honours, but Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt all offer workers the chance for equally happy, full lives.

Cities in Central and Eastern Europe, however, have a wider range of quality-of-living standards.

Mercer's annual Quality of Living survey is conducted to help multinational companies and other employers compensate employees fairly when assigning them to international destinations.

Admittedly, the survey focuses most on established and emerging business-focused cities and those with financial centres.

'Taking a short or long-term work assignment to a new country is both an exciting and challenge experience for employees and their families,' says Slagin Parakatil, Principal at Mercer. 

'Cultures, societies and comparatively different climates, as well as political instability, high crime rates and poor infrastructure can be difficult to navigate and settle down in.

'Employers need to assess whether their staff and families will encounter any drop in quality of living and ensure they are fairly compensated for it.'
