Regulator: A new Press watchdog is being set up as a result of the Leveson Inquiry

The tough new Press watchdog could be up and running in a matter of months after ‘very significant progress’ in setting up the regulator, it emerged yesterday.

The newspaper industry is close to sending out contracts that will establish the Independent Press Standards Organisation and aims to have it launched in the early part of next year.

Britain’s 200-plus newspaper and magazine publishers outlined details of the proposed watchdog two months ago, following the Leveson Inquiry into media standards.

It will have far tougher rules than the previous regulator, the Press Complaints Commission. The watchdog will have the power to impose fines of up to £1million for systemic wrongdoing and can require editors to publish up-front corrections ‘whether editors like it or not’.

Ipso will include a standards and compliance arm, with investigative powers to call editors to account.

A majority of its members at all levels will be independent and there will be no industry veto on appointments to the body.

Newspaper publishers say Ipso will be a ‘complete break with the past’ and will deliver all the ‘key recommendations’ made by Lord Justice Leveson.

Paul Vickers, chairman of the industry implementation group – which includes representatives from across the national, regional, periodical and Scottish Press – said the group met this week to finalise the legal and contractual documentation that will establish the new press regulator.

He added: ‘Very significant progress has been made.

‘A number of suggestions, both from  publishers and from other parties, have  been incorporated and the four key documents will shortly be ready for a final  consultation across the newspaper and magazine industry.

'Work is also well under way on the financing arrangements for Ipso, and the foundation group, under the chairmanship of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, is undertaking the task of selecting an independent appointments panel to appoint the first board.

‘We hope that we will therefore be in a position to begin signing contracts that will establish Ipso during late September and October, with a view to implementation of the new regulatory system, fully compliant with the Leveson principles, in the early part of the new year.’
