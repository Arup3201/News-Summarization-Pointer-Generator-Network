Damning: The CQC said patients are being given the wrong drugs and picking up serious infections

Four in ten hospitals are unsafe, a damning report reveals today.

Patients are being given the wrong drugs and picking up serious infections while shortages of staff mean the elderly are neglected and suffering falls, says the care watchdog.

A&E units and maternity wards are particular causes of concern, according to the Care Quality Commission.

In one shocking case, casualty patients were left for hours on trolleys in a temporary building to await treatment.

‘Far too many hospitals were inadequate on safety,’ declared CQC chief David Behan.

The findings are contained in an annual report into NHS standards which also covers care homes and GP surgeries.

‘The public is being failed by the numerous hospitals, care homes and GP practices that are unable to meet the standards that their peers achieve and exceed,’ warns the report.

The CQC has inspected 82 out of all 162 NHS hospital trusts. It found 65 were either ‘inadequate’ or ‘requires improvement’ in terms of safety.

This means four in five of those inspected were unsafe. The watchdog says this isn’t representative of all hospitals because it inspected those expected to be failing first.

However, it still means 41 per cent of all trusts – four in ten – have already been found inadequate in terms of safety – and the watchdog is only halfway through its inspections.

The findings come less than two years after a major overhaul of hospital standards that followed the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which hundreds died due to neglect.

Trusts were urged to hire extra staff, carry out hourly checks of patients and take extra measures to prevent mistakes with drugs and in surgery. But the CQC found that many hospitals were severely short of nurses at night, meaning frail patients are more likely to fall when they try to go to the toilet.

Inspectors also found cases of staff forgetting to give medication or giving it to the wrong patient after notes became mixed up.

A&E units caused particular concern and at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, Kent, patients were being left for hours in a temporary building due to a lack of space.

The watchdog is also worried that at many maternity units there are too few doctors and midwives on duty.

Mr Behan, CQC chief executive, said: ‘The majority [of hospitals] required improvement on safety.

‘There is too much variation in quality and safety between services and within service. People need to have confidence that they will get good care.’

The watchdog also inspected 1,725 surgeries and found that one in five were not meeting required standards of safety.

Again, it said this was not representative of all 8,000 practices in England because it started off by checking up on the worst.

Only yesterday Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that basic errors across the NHS were costing up to £2.5billion a year in extra treatment and legal fees.

Referring to the CQC report, he said it ‘highlights examples of excellent care but it also exposes unacceptable levels of variation – exactly why…we’re confronting underperformance in the NHS as never before.’

On one ward at an unnamed hospital an elderly woman with dementia developed two urinary infections because there were no nurses to help her to the toilet and she had to wet the bed.

This caused her to become extremely confused which staff just dismissed as another symptom of dementia.

Dr Katherine Rake of Healthwatch England, which champions patients’ rights, said: ‘The variability in care is simply unacceptable. We wholeheartedly support the CQC’s challenge to sub-standard parts of the system to improve and ensure everyone has access to high quality, safe and dignified support.’

Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘This report explains why people have reached the conclusion the NHS is simply not safe in David Cameron’s hands.’
