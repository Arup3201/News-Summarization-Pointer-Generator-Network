Downing Street has had some cunning residents over the years, but perhaps none quite as slippery as this cheeky fox, who scampered through this morning.

The creature caused quite a stir when it became trapped in the famous street ahead of a planned appearance by Prime Minister David Cameron.

The Tory leader was due to leave his official home ahead of Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons at midday today.

But instead of seeing the country's leader, photographers, armed police and awaiting aides watched as the fox appeared and ran around the fenced-off road looking for an exit.

The animal is one of hundreds of urban foxes living in the capital, which some say are becoming increasingly bold in their hunt for food.

The creatures are now often seen during the daytime, even in the busiest parts of the city, with reports of them going into people's homes.

This fox seemed uninterested in entering the corridors of power however, and soon disappeared into a neighbouring street.

Last month, it was reported that George Osborne's cat, Freya, had been banished from his 11 Downing Street residence because it did not get on with the Chancellor's dog, Lola.

In 2011, the sight of the Prime Minister's cat, Larry, became well-known in Downing Street after it was brought in to deal with a rat problem.

The pet, which has its own spoof Twitter account, was later retired amid claims he wasn't catching enough vermin.
