It doesn't look as though on-again off-again couple Hilary Duff and Mike Comrie will be on again any time soon after his drunken night at a famous LA eatery.

And Mike wasn't out for just a night of boozing. He was looking to hook up.  And he was willing to pay for it.

Actress and singer Duff, 27, and former ice hockey pro Comrie, 34, announced they had split a year ago after four years of marriage, despite remaining incredibly close and committed to their son, Luca, who turns three next month. And last September the singer did a Gwyneth Paltrow and insisted: 'We're uncoupled for now...If there wasn't a chance of getting back [together], we would have filed for divorce...'

But eyewitnesses at the famous steakhouse Mastro's in Beverly Hills, tell Daily Mail Online exclusively that the retired hockey player spent most of the evening of January 30th, drinking, alienating his friends and propositioning bar patrons and staff for sex.

Reconciliation?  Singer Hilary Duff and Mike Comrie separated last year after four years of marriage. She told a radio audience last fall that a reunion may be on the cards but Comrie was acting very single on January 30

Buzzed: Eyewitnesses at Mastro's in Beverly Hills, tell Daily Mail Online exclusively that the retired hockey player spent most of the evening of January 30th, drinking, alienating his friends and attempting to have sex with bar patrons and staff

Tossed: Security were able to put Mike in a taxi and ordered the taxi to take him home and not to another bar

'Mike and a buddy arrived around 9.00pm and were ushered to their private reserved table in the cocktail lounge of Mastros on the second floor,' a worker at the bistro tells Daily Mail Online.

'Mike was clearly already tipsy when he arrived. He was already slurring his speech a bit and walking funny, and it was only 9 pm.'

The hockey player was drinking throughout the evening, say observers. He was drinking cocktails along with shots of '1942,' a high end Cuervo tequila at about $33 per shot.

Canadian-born Comrie's family sold their furniture company in 2012 for $700 million. 

'I work there and I have to say he's a really nice guy, actually. He tips well and is super polite and kind. He was just drunk. But then things got worse.'

'I watched him as he blatantly and repeatedly hit on his waitress. I'm sure she was extremely embarrassed because other customers and staff saw this. She handled it well, remaining kind and professional. 

'Mike just wouldn't let up with the flirting. It became a bit creepy. Even his buddy tried to dial him back a bit.' 

But Mike was on a mission. Several eyewitnesses claim that Mike kept telling his server how much he liked her and how beautiful she was.

'Mike wanted to wait for her until her shift was over and take her out,' one eyewitness reveals.  'She told him nicely that she was not available, that she was in a relationship, but that didn't phase him. He kept insisting, sometimes loudly, that he wanted to wait until she got off work.

'She was in a tough spot. Then Mike wanted to settle his tab. That would be all well and good, but the tab had been paid for an hour prior and he owed no more money. He kept trying to pay her, for some reason. She couldn't get through to him.' 

'She actually started to feel bad for him. He's very handsome and so sweet, but he was very intoxicated and seemed deeply lonely if he were going to all of these extremes to pursue someone who was on staff and was in a relationship.

Still close: The All About You singer said  that she remains incredibly close to Mike and they are devoted to their son Luca. Mike took over parental duties on Wednesday as Hilary went off to catch a showing of 50 Shades of Grey

'He was also not wearing his wedding ring. I can't imagine how upset Hilary would feel if she knew Mike was acting like this in public.'

Eyewitnesses say that after his server left the table to close up for the night, Mike, now alone, approached the bar where where a couple were sitting.

'Mike's pal had left an hour or so before. So he'd been just drinking alone for a while and then as the restaurant was closing for the night, Mike approaches this woman at the bar. She is clearly sitting with her boyfriend or husband. Mike ignores the guy completely and starts talking to the woman.'

'I heard him say to her, "I saw you making eyes at me. Do you like what you see?"

'The woman assured Mike that he was mistaken, and even her date chimed in, trying to reassure Mike that no one was making eyes at him.'

'I'm watching all of this go down and it's clear that Mike was confused and very drunk now. The couple suggested, in almost a caring tone for the guy, that he should return to his table. This was not his finest hour and boy, I couldn't stop thinking about Hilary and the her little boy.'

That's when the couple, and restaurant staff, were horrified at what happened next.

'Mike would not go to his table. Instead, he reaches into his wallet and pulls out hundreds of dollars'

'He asked the nice woman at the bar, 'Ok. How much? How much do you want? I have as much as you need. How much for sex? Name your price. How much do you want to have sex with me?' 

When the woman's date objected, suggesting that Mike had overstepped his bounds and should back away, Mike became 'aggressive,' witnesses say.

'Mike got in the guy's face and said, "Come on. You and me. Let's step outside." 

'I alerted restaurant security because it looked to me like Mike was picking a fight with the man and wanted to possibly fight him outside. Why else would he want the woman's date to follow him out?'

House security stepped in and stopped the 'situation from escalating,' the server said.

'When security confronted Mike, he claimed to be sober and insisted he was sober and hanging with friends. In fact, he said not only was he totally sober but that he was the designated driver that night for his pals. 

'When Mike gestured at the table of friends, and the table was of course empty, Mike was promptly escorted to the valet parking station outside.'

Security were able to put Mike in a taxi and ordered the taxi to take him home and not to another bar. 

 Party hearty: The couple dressed to the nines for a Halloween party before they split

'I have to say, as the server who saw all of this, I feel  bad for Hilary. I know that she and Mike are separated but I'd heard that they've been trying to reconcile for the sake of their little boy. 

'I hope what Mike did the other night was an isolated scenario. He was drunk and sad and alone and asking strangers for sex at this five-star restaurant. Celebrities, politicians and dignitaries all dine here on a regular basis. So to have this sort of scene happen is rare.'

The pair announced their 'amicable' separation in January after almost four years of marriage since whenever they have been spotted together, they appear incredibly close.

On Wednesday Comrie took over parental duties as Hilary caught a matinee of 50 Shades of Grey. 

Opening up about the split last September, Hilary - in Australia promoting her latest single All About You - told the Kyle and Jackie O KIIS 1065 show the pair still 'really care a lot' for one another. 

And revealing intimate details about their relationship, she went on: 'When we were trying for a baby we weren't, "We have to have a baby right now".

'We were laid back...Whatever happens, happens. Once we're tired of doing this, we'll make a choice.

'We just don't really care what anyone thinks. We're being totally honest about it. My life is so up for grabs everyone knows everything.'

And when probed by radio presenters Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O about who looks after the pair's two-year-old son, Luca, Hilary revealed her mother and Mike share the responsibility when she's away working.

She said: 'My mom takes care of Luca a lot now. His dad and my mom are working hard to take good care of him.'
