A Life Cut Short: Jeremy Nelson, 12, collapsed during an all-star game in the local Burford, Georgia league in which he played

A hoops prodigy from a tiny Georgia town inexplicably collapsed during an organized basketball game Saturday - and later died at a local hospital.

Jeremy Nelson, 12, of Buford lost consciousness about 'eight seconds' after his coach, Bryan Larrieu, subbed him out of a Gwinnett Basketball League all-star game at the Suwanee Sports Academy.

The precocious hoopster, who wore a size-14 shoe and already towered over peers at six feet in height, reportedly received the annual physicals required to play organized sports in Buford.

'This time yesterday we were cheering him on,' Herb Nelson, Jeremy's heartbroken dad told CBSAtlanta.com Sunday, adding his son had no known health problems. 'You never - you never expect to leave home and come back without him.'

Buford is located in the northern central part of Georgia, and is a tiny town with a little over 12,000 residents, by the count of the last U.S. census. Despite its small size, however, the town has witnessed three people die while playing sports in the last year, alone.

A Medical Mystery: Nelson reportedly had the regular physicals necessary to play organized sports in Buford - and had no known health problems

'When it's your time - your number comes up,' Herb Nelson reportedly added. 'I would have traded places a thousand times with my son. You can't run from your time.'

Jeremy Nelson was having a typically good game before his unusual demise, according to media accounts.

'He was having a heck of a game when he pulled up from missing a shot,' Larrieu told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'We pulled him out to get some rest, eight seconds later, he was in and out of consciousness.'

The boy's frantic family waited what must have seemed an eternity before paramedics arrived.

'There was probably 15 minutes before the local police force came,' Larrieu told WSBRadio.com. 'Another five to seven minutes or so before the firemen came and another eight minutes before the paramedics came.'

Seventh-Grade Savant: Jeremy Nelson was a student at Buford Middle School (pictured), beloved for both his happy demenaor, as well as precocious athletic skills

Athletic Heritage: Jeremy Nelson hailed from an athletic family. His father played football at Grambling and his elder sister recently signed a letter of intent to play basketball at Notre Dame

Herb Nelson, meanwhile, told the station, 'When it's your kid lying there, it's never quick enough.'

A nearby doctor in attendance was able to ply a defibrillator, according to reports, but Jeremy Nelson later succumbed to whatever it was that caused his collapse at Gwinnett Medical Center.

Jeremy Nelson's family told multiple media outlets it's unclear if the seventh-grader suffered from an undetected heart condition. They are reportedly awaiting the results of an official medical examination.

The boy hails from an athletically-inclined family.

Father, Herb Nelson, played football at Grambling State University; twin sister, Jessica, also plays for Buford's seventh-grade basketball team, and his elder sister, Kristina, a high school senior, recently signed a letter of intent to play hoops at The University of Notre Dame.

“He was a phenomenal kid, with a great sense of humor, a loving kid,” Larrieu told The Journal-Constitution.

Meanwhile, Adam Gower, another of Jeremy's Nelson's coaches, told the Gwinnett Daily Post, 'He's a special kid from a special family, with a strong Christian background...All his peers looked up to him in the classroom, in the halls and on the court.

A Phenomenal Kid: Nelson already towered over peers at six-feet in height, and reportedly wore a size-14 shoe. His father had high hopes he would develop into a great hoopster

'When he spoke or had a question about history or a basketball play, he had everyone's attention. Jeremy was a great competitor, even if he was not sure of an answer his hand would go up first. Several times in the classroom, Jeremy would be very smooth by talking basketball to get me off subject.

'On the court,' added Gower, 'it was the same results. He would not allow anyone to out do him. (He) was a dynamic ball player and could play any position with his speed, skill level and height.

'Basketball was everything to Jeremy,' Gower added. 'Jeremy's love for the game of basketball is what gave us a connection and that made it very enjoyable for me to teach and coach him. But the one thing I will miss most about Jeremy Nelson is his delightful smile.'

The boy was also beloved by his Buford Middle School classmates.

'Jeremy was a very kind young man and an excellent student athlete,' schools superintendent Dr. Geye S. Hamby wrote in a widely-circulated statement. '(He) had a presence in the hallways and on the court...His very pleasant demeanor will be missed by all.

The Buford community has dealt with multiple deaths to beloved figures of late, according to The Gwinnett Daily Post, beginning with Buford grad and Wolves football coach Ryan Daniel, who collapsed during a pickup basketball game in January, 2012, and died.

Meanwhile, Buford student Adam Smith died in similar fashion during a September basketball workout.
