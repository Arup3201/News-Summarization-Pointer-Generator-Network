An elderly woman driver who had broken down in the middle of a motorway was killed when a Porsche car slammed into her vehicle and caused it to burst into flames, a jury heard today.

Mollie Haines, 73, was killed when her stranded Nissan Almera was struck from behind by 48-year-old Daniel Mitchell’s Porsche Cayenne on the M40 near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.

The collision’s force sent her vehicle spinning along the southbound carriageway, before it burst into flames. Mitchell was today accused in court of falling below the standard expected of a careful driver.

Trial: Mollie Haines (left), 73, was killed when her stranded Nissan Almera was struck from behind by Daniel Mitchell (right)’s Porsche Cayenne on the M40 motorway near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, in July 2012

Judge Francis Sheridan told jurors it was ‘a very sad case’ but warned them to consider the evidence clinically and not emotionally.

Rachel Drake, prosecuting, said: ‘The Crown says the death of Mollie Haines was caused by the careless driving of the defendant.

‘The only issue in this case is whether or not Mr Mitchell’s driving was without due care and attention. There’s no question but that the collision was the cause of Mrs Haines’s death.

‘The question is whether Mr Mitchell’s driving was careless. The assessment you have to make is whether or not you are sure his driving fell below the standard of a careful, competent and prudent driver.’

She explained the case concerned events shortly before 10am on July 18 last year. Mrs Haines had, along with a lot of other drivers, been stuck in stationary traffic on the southbound M40.

Fireball: The collision's force sent Mrs Haines's vehicle spinning along the southbound carriageway of the M40 motorway, before it burst into flames

‘She was in the second lane,’ said Miss Drake. ‘Unfortunately when the obstruction cleared and traffic began to flow freely again, she was unable to restart her car. So she was stationary in the second lane with traffic flowing around her.’

Jurors heard that a number of drivers will give evidence about seeing the Nissan and some about manoeuvring round it. One stopped on the hard shoulder and called the police to alert them.

Mrs Haines, who had illuminated her flashing hazard lights, contacted the AA, and her call and the other driver’s 999 alert prompted a highways camera operator to zoom in on her car.

‘The Crown say you can actually see the point where the Porsche Cayenne collides with the back of the Nissan Almera, causing it to spin and burst into flame,’ Miss Drake said.

‘As a consequence of the impact Mrs Haines died immediately.’

Wreckage: The jury was told it would also hear evidence about whether Mitchell had been changing lanes shortly before the collision on the M40 motorway near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire

She showed the jurors footage from the camera in which the vehicles could be seen passing the Nissan, before the car was propelled towards the hard shoulder and flames appeared in the road and the car.

'There’s nothing to say. I didn’t see her'

What Daniel Mitchell allegedly told police at the scene following the crash

Mrs Haines’s husband and children left the court while the footage was screened. Mitchell, a truck driver, had been on his way to work when the collision occurred.

After the impact he managed to get out of his car but needed treatment to an injured wrist.

Police officers arrested him while he was still in the back of the ambulance at the scene, and he responded: ‘There’s nothing to say. I didn’t see her.’

He was taken to hospital but later discharged himself and was taken to High Wycombe police station for questioning.

Investigation: Mitchell was today accused in court of falling below the standard expected of a careful driver

He said: ‘All I remember is looking and noticing the car in front is stationary. I don’t think I even had a chance to swerve.’

He told investigators he was used to driving a speed-limited lorry and when driving in his car he would normally travel between 60 and 70mph.

But Miss Drake said experts had calculated he was more likely to have been travelling between 75 and 80mph.

The jury was told it would also hear evidence about whether Mitchell, of Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire, had been changing lanes shortly before the collision.

The trial, at Aylesbury Crown Court, sitting in Amersham, continues.
