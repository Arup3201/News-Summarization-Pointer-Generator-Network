Traditionally for cats, it's always been about getting the cream - so the old saying goes. 

But it appears the bar has been raised a tad higher - with champagne, wads of cash and even handguns now  the desired possession of choice.

As this bizarre gallery shows, the world's richest cats are so well-off that they spend their time rolling around in piles of $100 notes, complete with a serving of Cognac on the side.

The images feature on a website called cashcats.biz, a site set up to celebrate the 'top one purrcent' of rich moggies. 

Featuring pets from the U.S to the Maldives, this gallery of cats has become such an online sensation that only five per cent of submissions are ever used.

Creator Will Zweigart, 35, said: 'One of the most fun aspects of the project is how varied the submissions are from a geographic perspective - every continent except Antarctica is represented.

'I can't even count all of the countries and types of currencies featured.'

The website invites wealthy pet owners to post photos of their smug-looking cats surrounded by the trappings of their wealth.

The 'cashcats' started out posing among wads of cash, but champagne, Cognac and other luxurious good soon started appearing in the background.

Now Mr Zweigart is inundated with images showing the cats set up among  loaded guns and illegal drugs.

Cat that got the cream: This moggy is so chuffed with its collection of bank notes, it even stuck his toungue out at the photographer 

He said: 'I've received a lot of submissions with cats surrounded by huge piles of drugs, because some folks who have $10,000 in cash lying around also have those things handy.

'I don't publish pictures like that for several reasons, mainly to ensure we don't set a bad example or create an unsafe environment for cats.

'We do occasionally publish pictures of cats who own guns, and evidently a lot of cats own guns around the world, which is surprising. 

'The site is really just mirroring our culture - particularly rap culture - and how we think about power and status. For some people power is a passport and a bottle of Dom, for others it's a Glock.' 

The digital marketer says he was inspired to start the site by his fiancé's cat Fugazi, who has starred on the site several times.

Despite modest beginnings, Cashcats now has accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram, thanks to submissions flowing in from around the globe. 

Mr Zweigart said: 'It's very diverse. I definitely get a lot of submissions from people who work in "cash only industries", if you will. 

'Only about five per cent of several thousand submitted photos end up making the site. Consider the site like an exclusive VIP room for high net worth felines.

'To make it even harder - cats will not model for you, hold still, or bend to your will. Any photo shoot must be on their terms.'

Despite the owners' desire to flash the cash, Mr Zweigart is clear that the cats are the real stars of the website.

'We all know that cats are slowly taking over the internet, partly because we don't really understand them,' he said.

'Cats are the only species who have managed to domesticate us, and they love how we haven't really figured that out yet.

'The site helps us to see cats how they see themselves - their facial expressions, which can convey power, status, mystery and an air of confidence that we can't exactly place. That 'one purrrcent' look.'

Living it up: This cat has so much cash in front of him, he can barely stand to look at it 

He also said the feedback on the site has been overwhelmingly positive.

He said: 'People send thank you notes on Tumblr saying it helped them get through a tough time, which is completely unexpected but awesome to hear.

'On social media, there is also a lot of self-identification, and I think that's why people share it on their own personal channels so much.

'It's a way of saying "this is me when I get paid next week" or "I need to get my cat on this site, my cat needs to ball as hard as these cats".'
