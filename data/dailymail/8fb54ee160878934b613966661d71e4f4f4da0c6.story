Tottenham pursuit of Argentine centre-back Federico Fazio looks to have been successful after Sevilla coach Unai Emery admitted he was resigned to losing his captain on Friday.

The 27-year-old has a 10m euro buy-out clause in his contract and so Europa League holders Sevilla are powerless to stop his departure. 

Emery said before the season kicks-off against Valencia on Saturday: “There is no chance that he will be playing for us this weekend.'

'He is one of the pillars of the team but we will just have to find another player to take his place. I’m happy for him. We want him to stay but this is what happens when you win things.”

Spurs coach Mauricio Pochettino knows Fazio from his time coach La Liga side Espanyol. 

The former Under-20 Argentine international can play in holding midfield but it’s in the centre of defence that he makes best use of his impressive 6ft 4ins frame and where he helped Sevilla to European glory last season.

Sevilla signed Fazio as a 19-year-old in 2007 from Ferro Carril Oeste and his imposing physique but elegance on the ball drew comparisons with Gerard Pique at Barcelona. 

Injuries have not been kind to him since then and his career stagnated before Emery arrived at Sevilla.

This summer there were even questions asked of Barcelona by their supporters as to why they never looked at a player who would have cost them half as much as Thomas Vermaelen.

He felt his form last season should have earned him a call-up to the national team and a place in the Brazil World Cup. 

Alejandro Sabella was not a fan but new Argentina coach Tata Martino is, and the move to the Premier League could now be his springboard to international football.
