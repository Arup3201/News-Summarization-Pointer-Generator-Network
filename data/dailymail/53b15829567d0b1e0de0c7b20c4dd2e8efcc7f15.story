Will Moyes survive until the end of the season?

Manchester United great Paul Scholes has delivered a grim assessment of his old club – and singled out £27.5million flop Marouane Fellaini for criticism.

Fellaini was outclassed by David Silva, Fernandinho and Yaya Toure at Old Trafford on Tuesday night as United slumped to a humiliating 3-0 defeat in the Manchester derby in front of their own fans.

The Belgian, whose only goal this season was for Everton against Stevenage in the Capital One Cup, was also lucky to escape a red card when referee Michael Oliver only booked him for blatantly thrusting a forearm into the face of Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta.

Backing: Scholes, sat alongside Graeme Souness, claimed David Moyes deserves more time as manager

‘He’s not been great, has he?’ said Scholes, one of the greatest midfielders of his generation. ‘You have to admit that. For a central midfielder at Manchester United for £27m, I’m expecting a few goals at least.

‘He did have problems with his wrist and I know he missed a lot of games but, for the money they paid for him, I’d be expecting a lot more, to be honest with you.'

Asked if Fellaini should have been sent off, Scholes replied: 'Yes, without a shadow of a doubt. It's a proper bang into his jaw. How do you get away with that? I've no idea. The referee's stood five yards away.'

Scholes was appearing as a Sky pundit for Tuesday’s game and agreed with his former Old Trafford team-mate Gary Neville that United are suffering from a lack of pace. Both seemed surprised that Fellaini was preferred to veteran Ryan Giggs, who gave a virtuoso performance against Olympiacos in the Champions League last week.

‘Whenever we played we always had quick players playing with us,’ added Scholes. ‘Tonight there was Welbeck and Rooney who ran in behind a couple of times but didn’t get seen.

‘That’s when you need players like Ryan Giggs. He is the one who will pass the ball forward. He doesn’t care if he gives it away three or four times, he’ll still risk it. To be a Man United midfielder you need risk in your game.

‘It looks to me that there are a few areas that need addressing. Centre midfield, you could say they’ve been looking for quite a few years now and haven’t quite come up with the answer.

‘Going forward we’re alright. The quality of Van Persie and Rooney, Mata in his right position, I think we’re all right up there. It’s more midfield and defence where we need to look.

‘Defensively, Vidic is going and it looks like Rio and Evra could be going as well. That’s three of your back four gone. That’s another area he’s got to look after.’

Scholes believes that United should stand by David Moyes as pressure begins to mount on the beleaguered boss again in the wake of another embarrassing home defeat.

And he hinted that the club had let their new manager down last summer by not offering him greater support to add to the signing of Fellaini before Juan Mata arrived in January.

‘He’s nine months into the job and you have to stand by him,’ said Scholes. ‘He’s made a couple of signings that haven’t worked out yet as he would have liked. In the summer he’s going to need backing, there’s no doubt about that.

‘Was he backed as well as he could have been last summer? I’m not too sure. But this summer he has to be backed and I think he knows he needs players.'

He does, however, indicate that the manager is making mistakes - particularly with Mata. 'He is a classic No 10,' said Scholes. 'Has he got to play in that position yet?' before adding his surprise at Antonio Valencia being overlooked for the game.

'I'm amazed that Valencia isn't playing,' he mused at half time. 'I would have loved to see him have a right go down that right hand side.'

Don't sack him! Despite a horror run of results, Scholes believes United have to stick with Moyes

The former England midfielder, who made 718 appearances in a glittering career at United, admitted that it was hard to watch City demonstrate the gulf in class between the two clubs as they won at Old Trafford for the third time in a row.

‘City were far better than us,’ said Scholes. ‘You could tell which team were going for the league and which team were in seventh, it was that glaringly obvious.

‘City have got the best team, the best players, they play the best football, they’ve got goals everywhere.

‘In the first 10 minutes you thought maybe it could have been three or four. It could have been anything.

'Tonight I never believed we were going 
to get back into the game - even at 1-0. I was never really confident we
 were going to create chances and score goals.

‘In the second half we never got 
going. We huffed and puffed without creating clear-cut chances. That was
 always the way for us. We might have been two or three down but we 
never felt we were beaten. Tonight I never really felt we were going to 
get back into the game even at 1-0.

‘Tonight’s been difficult but I’m sure we’ll have our day again.’

Wizard: David Silva was a standout performer for City as he kept things ticking for Manuel Pellegrini's side

Looking ahead: Scholes doubts whether Manuel Pellegrini's side can win the Premier League title

Silva was electric for Manuel Pellegrini's side during the thumping win, and Scholes was understandably impressed: 'You have to be impressed with what he does. His touch… it’s almost glued to his left foot. Then he does the same with his right foot. Either foot he’ll take it and he can play a pass.

'He has a little bit of pace about him as well. He can manoeuvre the ball well, play people in and has a goal in him. The first 10 minutes he was unplayable.'

But the 39-year-old was damning in his assessment of the first two goals. 'Does Fellaini stay with Silva?' he asked. 'No. I'm not sure what Phil Jones has seen there, he's created a big gap.'

When dissecting the second, scored by Dzeko from a corner, Scholes added: 'The warning signs were there - it had happened three or four times. (Vincent) Kompany got in before. Rio Ferdinand won't be happy. Rio has stood off him there. You've got to stay tighter.'
