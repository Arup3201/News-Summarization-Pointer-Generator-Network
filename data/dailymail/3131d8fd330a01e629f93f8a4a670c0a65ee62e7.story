A family of four who were all overweight have worked together to shed the pounds.

The Mac Mahons,  from Skipton, have lost a total of 9st 13lbs between them in three months after deciding it was time to change their unhealthy lifestyles.

The waistlines of parents Samantha, 43, and Nigel, 45, and their daughters Hannah, 20, and Katie, 18, all increased after Samantha was diagnosed with ME, until they tipped the scales at a combined weight of 65 stone 3lbs.

Samantha explains how the whole family's health deteriorated after she began suffering from the symptoms of ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome.

She said: 'There are no words to explain the way
 I felt. The tiredness was like no other. I lost my job as a teaching assistant and the ability 
to care for my family. My husband Nigel had to become my carer, helping
 me get out of bed, get dressed, eat and do all the things I used to do 
on my own.

'I had always done the cooking; cleaning and taking care of the family, but my illness meant I couldn't do that anymore.'

As time went on the family's diet started to change and takeaways and processed food fast became the norm.

Self-esteem boost: Hannah had less confidence when she was a size 16, left, but now she's a slim size 12

Nigel, a train driver and also a crew
 manager for North Yorkshire fire and rescue service, said: 'It was 
easier for me to grab a takeaway on the way home from
 work, but the more often this happened the more the whole family relied
 on quick fix takeaways and snacks to keep them going.'

Samantha's weight rose to 14 stone 6lbs, dress size 20, while Nigel was 23 stone 9lb.

Meanwhile, their daughters Hannah and Katie weighed 13 stone 2lbs and 14 stone respectively and were dress sizes 16-18.

Hannah, who is studying a business degree, admitted her diet was 'dreadful'.

She said: 'I would always skip 
breakfast, not eat much during the day then eat badly in the evenings.'

Media apprentice Katie's eating habits were similar. She said: 'I
 did the same thing. Rarely having breakfast and skipping lunch left me 
starving in the evening and I'd end up eating into the late hours. I'd 
snack as well, eating chocolate, crisps, chips, pasta and cereal. I 
hated exercise and spent most of my time in front of the television when
 I wasn't at college.'

The sisters said their weight affected their confidence and happiness.

Hannah said: 'I
 would also skip nights out with friends. The truth is when you hate 
yourself so much; you struggle with social situations and your lack of 
confidence makes you just want to hide away.'

Katie agreed: 'Because I was overweight, I didn't 
want to go out with my friends, they were all skinnier than me and I 
felt uncomfortable around them. I didn't feel good in anything I wore, I
 felt very unhappy.'

The turning point came when Nigel was told his obesity could send him to an early grave.

He explains: 'Our weight and 
waistlines obviously increased, but that wasn't the only thing. I 
started to suffer with general aches and pains and was experiencing 
headaches and heartburn. It actually turned out to be much more serious 
than that and my GP told me that I was at high risk of having a heart 
attack if I didn't change my diet and lifestyle.'

Samantha said they knew they had to do something to change their ways. 'I hated seeing my girls sad and not
 wanting to go out and enjoy themselves and certainly didn't want Nigel 
having a heart attack', she said.

Concerned about her father's health after his warning from his GP, Hannah called a family meeting where they all agreed to stick to a diet programme.

Nigel has whittled his waist from 48 to 44 inches and said it was all thanks to the family working together to achieve their goal

Hannah had heard about the 'Body by Vi Challenge' from a friend and the family decided to try it.

Nigel was initially reluctant but agreed to give it a go. He said: 'When the girls came 
home and told me all about Body by Vi Challenge, I was a little skeptical. I hate 
diets and all the fuss and organising you have to do. Plus with my work 
patterns nothing seemed to actually work. I either ate too much or not 
enough. 'As a 
dutiful husband I listened and a lot of what Samantha said 
began to appeal. I was very overweight and my health was suffering and I
 agreed to join the Challenge.'

The family started with the 90 day challenge that involves replacing two meals a day with Vi-Shape shakes, only having filling snacks from their range and a home made low fat meal in the evening.

After three months sticking to the programme, Samantha has lost 2st 1lb, Nigel 3st 9lb, Hannah 2st 2lb and Katie 2st 3lb.

Samantha, who now weighs 12st 5lbs and has dropped to a dress size 16, said they all feel better for the diet. She said: 'But the biggest thing for me personally is how I
 feel and how it's improved my health.

'Almost instantly I began to feel 
more energised not just physically but mentally. I feel more alert and 
as the pounds began to melt away I started to feel more confident and 
positive.'

Nigel, who now weighs 20 stone and has whittled his waist from 48 to 44 inches, said doing the challenge together made all the difference.

He said: 'Doing the challenge as a family has
 been great. We have encouraged and supported each other through the 
highs and lows. We are all on the same wavelength.'

Samantha, pictured side on before, left, and after the family diet said: 'Our weight-loss has given us all new found confidence'

Total weightloss: 9st 13lb

He added: 'I feel so much better. All the symptoms I was suffering have eased tremendously; I can even tie my shoe laces again.'

Hannah, now 11st 2lbs, dress size 12, and Katie, 11st 11lbs, dress size 14, said they feel so much more confident after slimming down. Katie said: 'I'm enjoying shopping
 for smaller clothes and beginning to like what I see in the mirror, 
even my skin and my hair look and feel healthier. It's so nice when 
people give me compliments.'

The family are now determined to stick to their new lifestyle by maintaining a healthy diet and exercising by joining a gym.

Samantha explained: 'We all are a lot more thoughtful as to what we eat. We do have treats but actually our food is so much better. We still eat well but healthier versions of previous meals. A family favourite is fajitas â€“ the chicken is baked with no fat and the vegetables are roasted with a spray of low cal fry light. We have a tortilla each or Hannah and I like to use romaine lettuce as a wrap for a healthier choice. Then top with salsa or I make a low cal yoghurt dressing with chopped mint.

'We also make curries from scratch instead of a sauce from a jar. And we have brown rice instead of white and we portion control our meals.

'We don't add fat to food, we roast , bake or grill the meat, the same with vegetables. If we have a sauce it's tomato based as they are less fattening.

'We've cut out bread and have very few potatoes but as a treat we still have our roast dinners. We've found just making these small changes have helped.'

Vi Challenge were so impressed with their combined weightloss of 9st 13Ib they named them winners of the family weightloss competition.

Samantha said they were delighted by the recognition but added: 'The best prize of all is having my family back to the way we used to be. Our weight-loss has given us the new found confidence we needed to get back on track.'
