When asked who would be leading the 2015 goalscoring charts across Europe's top five leagues, most football fans would predict that either Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo would be top of the tree.

In fact, there's one more very important name that has been making headlines in the Premier League for his ability to find the net since the turn of the year. 

When Harry Kane pulled Tottenham level against Liverpool on Wednesday night, he joined Barcelona star Messi on eight goals for 2015, which is more than any other player in England, Spain, Italy, France or Germany.

Harry Kane celebrates scoring his eighth goal of the year during Tottenham's 3-2 defeat against Liverpool 

Lionel Messi has scored eight goals in as many games for Barcelona since the turn of the year

Although his side ended up suffering a 3-2 defeat at Anfield on Wednesday, Kane added to his impressive tally of 13 Premier League goals for Mauricio Pochettino's side as the young striker looks to keep pace with the likes of Diego Costa, who leads the way with 17 goals to his name so far.

Kane's form in front of goal has been rising quickly since his headed goal against Swansea in December, 2014. 

In fact, Kane hadn't scored a Premier League goal until November when Pochettino began to give the youngster a run in the team. 

Since then, the 21-year-old has bagged 12 goals in 15 games for the north London club. And since New Year's Day, Kane has helped Spurs put Chelsea, West Brom and Arsenal to the sword with some sensational solo performances.

Kane scored the first two of his eight 2015 goals against London rivals Chelsea on January 1 in a game which saw the youngster terrorise one of the best defences in the Premier League as Spurs marched to a memorable 5-3 victory at White Hart Lane. 

The 20-year-old has now scored 13 Premier League goals for Spurs, including two against Arsenal

The former Leyton Orient loanee then added to his tally in the 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace before bagging four goals in two games against West Brom and Arsenal in Saturday's north London derby.

Messi, on the other hand, has managed to score eight goals in as many games for Barca as the diminutive Argentinian looks to propel his side to the top of La Liga. 

A hat-trick against Deportivo on January 18 was the highlight for Messi, who already has 33 goals in all competitions for the Catalan giants.

Spurs fans will no doubt enjoy 'one of their own' Kane keeping pace with Messi in a list which also includes Neymar, Mario Mandzukic and Gonzalo Higuain. 

Interestingly, Ronaldo is nowhere to be seen in our top 10 list after a difficult start to the year which has seen the Portuguese banned for two games after he was sent off against Cordoba and notching four goals - a measly tally by his almighty standards.

The Spurs faithful may well start to wonder how long they can keep hold of Kane should the young Englishman continue to keep pace with Europe's elite.
