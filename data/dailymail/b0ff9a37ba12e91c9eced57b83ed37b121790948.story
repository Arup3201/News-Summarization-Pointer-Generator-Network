In its third survey of more than 5,000 singles, dating website Match.com found that 48per cent of women admit that 
they research a first date on Facebook.

An almost equal number expect to know a man's work status before their first meeting.

However, 
49per cent of men believe that practice of pre-screening is '
unacceptable.'

Single sleuths: Almost half of women surveyed by Match.com admitted that they research a man before the first date, but many men found this practice unacceptable (posed by model)

The survey also found that the so-called 'three-day rule' is dead, since the majority of men (78per cent) claimed that they reach out before 72 hours has lapsed.

However while nearly three-quarters of people 
surveyed believed it was appropriate to kiss on a first date, only 22per
cent thought that jumping into bed was okay.

Denver, Colorado is the most active city: 47per cent of singles there 
went on a date in 2012. By profession, journalists top the list with 45per cent reporting that they dated last year.

Dating demographics: Match.com asked 5,000 people across America about their dating habits and found out that singles in Denver, Colorado went on the most dates in 2012

And singles in Chicago and Los Angeles are the boldest: 
Just over half in both cities said that they initiated their last encounter.

On dating forums, men and women are debating the results. Some thought it was invasive, while others wrote comments like 'the Internet is making life hard for players. Ten minutes of searching gives you a pretty good idea of who you are dealing with.'

And it seems that almost half of women agree: 49per cent would cancel a first date if they unearthed disturbing digital 'evidence'.

Mating habits: Almost three quarters of singles thought it was appropriate to kiss on a first date, but only 22per cent felt the same way about jumping into bed 

Advice to men from Match.com's dating expert Whitney Casey: Do some selective editing.

'Make sure that there’s 
nothing that would have her running for the
door before even getting to meet you in person,' Casey wrote in a 
recent blog post. Instead of posting 'the keg-stand profile picture you 
might 
have currently,' she recommends opting for a subtler shot.
