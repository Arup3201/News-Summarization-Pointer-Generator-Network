Scores of officers from the Ministry of Defence police are under investigation for allegedly skipping vital security patrols and even taking naps while on duty at a nuclear bomb factory.

As many as 50 officers are involved in the inquiry, which centres around security failures at a branch of the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Burghfield, Berkshire.

There are claims that some were even sleeping on the job at the 225-acre complex, where technicians build Trident nuclear warheads.

The MoD has reported 
the allegations to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It 
added that seven officers have resigned without facing disciplinary 
charges.

A source told the 
Daily Mirror: 'At least some of the police were sleeping on the job when
 they missed the patrols. This is highly embarrassing at such a key 
facility.'

Protests are 
regularly held - and arrests made - at the massive high-security complex
 near Reading, one of two sites where the ballistic missile warheads 
have been built, maintained and decommissioned since 1992.

Peter
 Burt, of atomic weapons campaign group the Nuclear Information Service,
 called the accusations against the armed policemen supposed to be 
guarding the sensitive site complex 'astonishing'.

'The
 government never misses an opportunity to tell us how sites like this 
are at constant risk from terrorists,' he told the paper.

'It's clear there have been problems with security and supervision at a high level.'

failing to complete patrols and sleeping on the job at the highly 
sensitive site near Reading

The MoD denied claims that staff were being investigated for sleeping on the job.

The
 spokesman said that disciplinary action was immediately initiated due 
to the seriousness of nuclear security and where appropriate, officers 
have been removed from the site to other duties pending the conclusion 
of the misconduct investigation.

The
 MoD spokesman added: 'We can confirm a number of officers are under 
investigation for failing to complete their full patrols at the Atomic 
Weapons Establishment.

'The
 investigation is ongoing and the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission has been notified. It would be inappropriate to comment 
further while the case is ongoing, however we can be clear that at no 
point was the security of the site or its nuclear assets compromised.'

The
 spokesman said security at AWE sites is constantly reviewed and 
Ministry of Defence Police will work to ensure that any improvements 
needed as a result of the investigation are implemented.

The allegations only relate to a small proportion of the patrolling requirement at the site, the spokesman added.

Distinct
 from the Royal Military Police, which is drawn from the Army, the MoD 
police is a 2,700-strong civilian force which guards military and 
'Critical National Infrastructure' sites across the country.

Its
 officers have the same powers as normal police, but all MoD police are 
trained to use guns and 90 per cent are armed at any given time - 
usually with Heckler & Koch submachine guns.
