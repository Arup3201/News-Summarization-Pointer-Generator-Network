Not long after full-time on Sunday and David de Gea has already posted photographs of his stellar performance against Everton on his Instagram page. By this morning, they had been viewed and 'liked' by almost 70,000 people.

Pretty much one for every United fan inside Old Trafford on Sunday, the ripples of De Gea's efforts nevertheless spread much further than the boundaries of Stretford, Manchester. This was perhaps that day when De Gea confirmed his arrival as one of the best goalkeepers in the world.

It has been some journey, too.

De Gea spoke in recent days of his work with new United goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek.

'He is one of the best coaches I have ever seen,' said De Gea.

'It's a new system. He knows everything about positioning and what I should do with my feet.'

Three years ago, however, the work United were trying to get in to their new arrival from Atletico Madrid was different, certainly more basic.

'His first six months were horrendous,' said De Gea's former goalkeeping coach Eric Steele in an interview with the United We Stand fanzine.

'We worked with him on and off the field to make him more powerful. We changed his lifestyle.

'He would finish training and want to go home. When I told him to come back in the afternoon he'd ask, "Why?"

'There were lifestyle issues. He'd sleep two or three times a day. He'd have his main meal late at night. We pushed protein drinks on him straight after training.

'We physically made him drink. We had him in the gym a lot. He hated it. They don't do the gym in Spain as much. We needed to build his core strength.

'But he has calmness, composure and inner strength. Nothing fazes him.

'Playing in front of 76,000? No problem. Very few possess that.'

De Gea's official stats reveal  that he weighs 76kilos, just short of 12 stone. That's five kilos (or ten pounds) heavier than when he arrived for almost £18m in the summer of 2011.

The improvement is testimony to time spent in the gym, time spent changing his body from one that Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp famously said needed 'to grow in to his clothes' to the purpose-built Barclays Premier League physique we see today.

'I do not think people appreciate just how hard it was for me coming to a new country at that age and a different type of football,' said De Gea in one interview.

'I knew I had to become bigger physically. You can see now I look different to when I first came here. I have much more muscle.

'In training the players would deliberately hit high balls into me and barge into me so I would get used to that side of the English game.

'I actually enjoy the physical side of it all now.

'Eric Steele was a great goalkeeping coach who always looked after me and I will remember that.'

De Gea's improvement at United has been steady. Peculiarly he still has only two Spanish caps, a fact reflective of the enduring talents of Real Madrid's Iker Casillas.

Nevertheless the arrival of Ander Herrera at Old Trafford this summer means that the triumvirate of Herrara, De Gea and Juan Mata is back in harness not too many years since the three friends combined to help Spain win the Under 19 European Championship. 

'David is one of the most skilled goalkeepers I've ever seen,' said Mata after De Gea played his 100th United game earlier this season.

One of the few players to actually improve during the difficult United tenure of David Moyes - due largely to the work of the Scot's goalkeeping coach Chris Woods - De Gea is now attempting to improve still further under the rather forensic guidance of Dutch coach Hoek.

The man credited in Holland with the ingenious way Louis van Gaal used his goalkeepers during the World Cup, Hoek has worked largely on De Gea's positioning and distribution, sending the 23-year-old home at night with videos not only of his own performances but also those of other Premier League goalkeepers.

'I watch the images of the games and we speak about that,' De Gea told MUTV.

'It's important and I watch all the other goalkeepers at home.

'Sunday was one of the best games of my career for Manchester United and I'm really happy with the saves, the win and for the team as well.

'It's difficult to say something about the crowd. When they sing your name like this, it is unbelievable.

'I watched his [Leighton Baines] penalties before the game and I saved it.

'But you have to be lucky sometimes.'

Seemingly settled now in the Cheshire enclave of Altrincham, De Gea no longer lives with his parents here. Steele and former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson encouraged him to be more independent, feeling it would help him grow on and off the field.

Now fully able to converse in English - something he wasn't confident of doing as recently as 2013's summer tour of Australia and the Far East - De Gea has banished the homesickness that also blighted his early days in the North West.

Like all southern European players, De Gea thinks of home and future opportunities there. Why wouldn't he? 

For now, though, he has other ambitions.

'When Edwin van der Sar said he was leaving Manchester United I wanted to be the man to replace him,' he said.

'I was given that chance and I am not going to let it go.

'I would love if one day the fans speak of me in the same way they speak of Edwin and Peter Schmeichel.

'That would mean all the hard work has paid off.'
