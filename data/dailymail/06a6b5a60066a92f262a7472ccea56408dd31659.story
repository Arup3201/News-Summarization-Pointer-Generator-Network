A woman with just months left to live has achieved her final 'bucket list' wish of marrying in a church.

Local businesses and a hospice in Houston rallied together on Saturday to provide a dream wedding for Morrissia Sauer, 50, who suffers from congestive heart failure.

Although she wed her husband Johnny eight years ago, they were married by a justice of the peace and Sauer, a Catholic, wrote in her bucket list she wanted a wedding recognized by the church.

Dream wedding: Morrissia Sauer has been granted a bucket list wish of marrying her husband Johnny at a church. Although the couple has been married 8 years, she wanted it to be recognized by the church

On hearing her story, local 
businesses sprung into action with the help of Silverado Hospice, which 
provides Sauer's in-home care, KHOU11 reported.

The Co-Cathedral, which normally requires a year-and-a-half notice before booking, told the family that time of December 14 was available.

Hospice Chaplain Deacon Daniel Addis oversaw the wedding while his daughter provided the music.

A local photographer offered her services for free, while a local bakery donated a wedding cake and a stylist provided hair and makeup services. A florist donated bouquets, corsages and a display for the reception.

Joy: The wedding was held after local businesses rallied together to provide their services for free

'Oh it's phenomenal,' Sauer said. 'Last of my bucket list - it's great.'

Her husband added: 'This is a lot more than I anticipated. I just thought we were going to have a 
simple little ceremony and it kind of snowballed on us. And I'm very 
appreciate and grateful.'

Sauer had penned a bucket list on the recommendation of social workers and listed 17 achievements she hoped to gain before succumbing to her illness.

Most items detailed how she hoped reconcile with her children and God. Another said that she wanted to slow-dance with her husband one more time.

Last moments: The wedding was the final item on her bucket list, which included reconciling with family, having a slow dance with her husband, and eating a lobster dinner and chocolate dessert

'If you read the list there's nothing grandiose on the list,' Johnny said.

She also made a request to have dinner from Red Lobster and the hospice helped arrange
 to have the restaurant deliver to their Richmond home.

'They
 served it to us personally,' she said. 'Set us down like we were at the 
restaurant. My bucket list of big lobster dinner with 
the most rich, decadent chocolate cake I could imagine. Boy it was too!'
