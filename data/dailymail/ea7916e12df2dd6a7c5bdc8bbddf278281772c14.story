A spa manager received third-degree burns when a scented candle set light to acetone she was using to clean an elderly woman's nails.

Julia McKeown, who works at the four-star Dalmeny Hotel in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, was badly burned on her hands, arms, chest and stomach and had to spend three months in hospital having skin grafts after the accident.

Today Blackpool Magistrate's Court heard Mrs McKeown, 38, also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. The customer, 96-year-old Mary Heyworth, was unharmed.

The accident happened when Mrs McKeown spilled the chemical on herself and the candle. Staff rushed to help her but she suffered third-degree burns and had to have skin grafts

The accident happened in January last year when Mrs McKeown spilled acetone on herself during a spa treatment in the pool area of the hotel.

Mrs McKeown was engulfed in flames after the liquid also spilled on to a scented tea light candle which was being used in a decorative lantern.

Staff rushed to help her and managed to put out the flames, but Mrs McKeown was already very badly burned.

Michael Hayton QC, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Mc Keown the salon manager was using a pad soaked in acetone from a two and a half litre bottle.

'The bottle spilled and splashed on the beautician’s arms and body and the table.She and her clothing ignited from the naked flame of a tealight type of candle which was lit and placed in a open topped lantern.

'Staff went to her aid but she had to undergo extensive skin grafts some of them full depth.

'The local council investigated and found a a the hotel company failed in its duty to protect its employees.There was no training and no supervision when it came to using what is known to be a significantly hazardous product.

'The investigation showed there had been previous spillages of acetone and the company had been previously warned about health and safety issues.'

Fining Dalmeny Hotel Ltd £16,000 and ordering the company to pay £9,075 in costs, District Judge Joanne Hirst said: 'The woman suffered significant and horrific burns to her body.

'She has suffered a loss of self esteem as a result and her marriage has been affected, as has her social life.

'The hotel failed to heed earlier warnings about health and safety. There had been previous problems with the use of acetone and a systematic failure in safety and risk to staff.'

Charles Lavery, defending, said: 'The directors of the hotel deeply regret what happened. They believe the size of the bottle their member of staff purchased was unsuitable to use to take off nail varnish.

'After the incident, caused by failings which conspired together, the company brought in health and safety consultants and has totally addressed any problems.'

Mrs McKeown, who has worked at the spa since 2006, is now back at work but has launched a compensation claim against her employers.
