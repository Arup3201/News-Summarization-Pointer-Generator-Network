A cat killer is being hunted after at least six pets were poisoned in a week in the same street.

The cats became severely disorientated and behaved as though drunk before collapsing and dying.

Tests showed that each had consumed antifreeze and the RSPCA believes they were killed intentionally. Other owners in Albert Street in Padiham, near Burnley, fear their pets are at risk.

Emma and Cadie Mayor are two of the residents on Albert Street in 
Padiham, near Burnley, whose beloved cat died after drinking antifreeze 
which the RSPCA believe was used deliberately to poison the pets

Emma Mayor, 34, whose cat Gizmo was one of those to die, said: ‘We just thought he must have just found the antifreeze somewhere and drank it but who would be using antifreeze in June?

'Now we know that six have died altogether so someone must be doing it deliberately.'

She had to take her pet
 Gizmo to the vet after he appeared to be ‘drunk’ and was struggling to 
walk or stand up. Miss Mayor was told there was nothing that could
 be done and he had to be put down.

She said the terraced street in Padiham in Lancashire used to be known 
as ‘Cat Street’ due to the high number of felines living there.

But the numbers have been decimated by a cruel campaign to wipe them out.

She said: ‘Gizmo wasn’t just a cat, he was the love
 of my life. I got him when my mother died and he cheered me up and just
 became part of the family. He was my little boy. I’m devastated by 
what’s happened.’

Miss Mayor's cat Gizmo had to be taken to the vet after appearing 'drunk' and struggling to walk or stand up. The vet had to put Gizmo down, saying there was nothing they could do to help

Vivien Storey, 44, whose cat Diesel died
 last week, only realised there was something wrong when her 14-year-old
 pet tried to jump over a wall, fell and had a fit.

Vivien Storey, 44, another resident on the street, also had to watch her cat Diesel die after she drunk the poison

‘It upset me that much that I went outside into the street to try to find someone to help me. I just couldn’t look at her, it was breaking my heart.

‘I rang my husband and he came home and wrapped her in a towel and took her to the vets,’ Mrs Storey said yesterday.

‘She said it was the same symptoms as other cats in the street and that we’d have to have her put to sleep.’

The RSPCA is also investigating the poisoning of cats in nearby Nelson.

Inspector Charlotte Booker said: ‘This is a horrendous act of cruelty against pets that are much-loved and it will not be tolerated. We also want to urge all cat owners in these areas to be vigilant and to look out for the symptoms of poisoning. ‘

She said cats who display tell-tale symptoms of anti-freeze poisoning can be treated and recover if they are taken to the vet within the first 24 hours.

‘Cats often look as though they are drunk and struggle to move around as normal,’ she said. ’If anyone notices any of these symptoms, please get your cat to the vets straight away.’

Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 offenders face a six month jail sentence or a fine of up to £20,000 if convicted.
