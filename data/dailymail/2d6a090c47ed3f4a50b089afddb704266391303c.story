Cop-out? A quarter of people admit to sending a text message telling their boss they are sick

More workers are ditching the traditional sickie telephone call and texting their bosses instead.

A quarter of employees admitted to sending their boss a text message rather than explaining their ailments over the phone.

And one in six people even resorted to sending a Facebook message instead of picking up the phone to their manager.

But the survey of 10,000 people found almost three-quarters of bosses think that texting or emailing in sick is a cop-out.

And 15 per cent of managers said an employee calling in sick because of  a cold would arouse suspicion that they are lying to get a day off.

This mistrust has led suspicious bosses to play workers at their own game, taking to social media to check on their staff, with 20 per cent admitting to checking their sick employee’s Facebook page.

Some managers admitted to calling their missing employees on a different phone number, with one in 20 even driving to their staff member’s house.

The research, by cough and cold medication Covonia, found that those who do call exaggerate their symptoms with a quarter of people straining their voice or pretending to cough.

A third of people are also wary of using Facebook on a sick day, with 34 per cent saying they avoid using it to try not to raise their bosses’ suspicions.

But expect no sympathy from your colleagues when you return to work as the research showed thirteen per cent of people would consider a co-worker to be weak if they took a sick day for a cold.

Snooping: Some bosses admitted checking their absent employees Facebook to check if they were really ill

Director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University, Professor Ron Eccles, said: 'Colds are actually more difficult to contract than people believe and there is no evidence that going to work will increase the instances in the community.

'Cold sufferers are at their most contagious up to three days before exhibiting any symptoms, so by the time they are feeling unwell, the chance of catching their illness is already reduced.

'In fact, to catch a cold, close and prolonged contact to the virus is required which is why most colds are spread at home.

'If you do fall ill, by proactively treating symptoms with an appropriate remedy and washing hands regularly, there is really no reason the common cold should get in the way of day-to-day responsibilities.'
