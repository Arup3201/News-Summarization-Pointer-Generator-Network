A bar of Kendal Mint Cake dating back to 1964, recently found in an attic, is believed to be the oldest in Britain.

Peter Truelove, 68, bought the bar of
 Robert Wiper’s Original Kendal Mint Cake when he and a friend visited 
Kendal, Cumbria as 21-year-olds.

The 48-year-old confectionery was made before the introduction of sell-by dates but is almost certainly still edible.

Peter Truelove rediscovered the old bar in the loft of his home, in Windermere, Cumbria, together with a journal recording his 'boys' adventure' with a friend, and the fact that he'd bought the bar in nearby Kendal

Mr Truelove (above) and his friend had travelled from their homes in Kent to John O'Groats, the most northerly point on the Scottish mainland - and bought the bar on the way back

Wiper's invented the climbers’ favourite energy bar - made of glucose and peppermint - by accident back in 1869, while trying to make glacier mints.

Mr Truelove rediscovered his old bar in the loft of his home, in nearby Windermere, together with a journal recording his 'boy’s adventure' with a friend, and the fact that he’d bought the bar.

They had travelled from their homes in Kent to John O’Groats, the most northerly point on the Scottish mainland.

'We travelled the distance in an Austin 7 and it took us a week,' said Mr Truelove.

Mr Truelove's journal documented the stop-off in Kendal. He said: 'I had to record everything we spent because my friend and I were splitting the cost of the trip'

'The car only did 35mph at best and it was blizzard weather - the snow was coming into the car.

'We called at Kendal on the way back and we’d heard about the mint cake, so when we saw some we thought we’d buy a bar.'

Mr Truelove said he was not sure why he had kept the bar in a box in his loft.

'It was on a shelf as a memento of the trip but it’s been in the loft since we moved to Windermere 16 years ago,' he said.

The bar is still in reasonable condition although some of the sugar is seeping through the wrapping.

Although the original Wiper's recipe is still used, the company was sold to Romney's in 1987.

Managing director John Barron said: 'We have been making it all these years and I don’t think we have any that old - it’s impressive.

'It wouldn’t do him any harm to eat it now but I don’t expect it would taste very nice.'

Mr Truelove said what was also interesting to discover was the journal he wrote while travelling, which documented the stop-off in Kendal.

He said: 'I had to record everything we spent because my friend and I were splitting the cost of the trip.

'It’s funny now to look back and see that someone offered to sell us a car engine and gear box for £2.50, and that 15 litres of petrol was 60p.

'Unfortunately, the price of the mint cake wasn’t included, although I did write that we’d visited and purchased it.'
