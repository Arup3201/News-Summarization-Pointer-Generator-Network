They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and it appears that even the bluest of blood doesn't make you immune from the urge to copy other people.

Sweden's royal family has released a photo of recently engaged Prince Carl Philip, 35, and his fiancée, in which the 29-year-old bride bears a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.

Like the Duchess, Sofia Hellqvist boasts long, dark hair softly styled into waves, while her fitted blue dress is reminiscent of the Issa number worn by Kate for her 2011 engagement portrait.

Snap: Prince Carl Philip and Sofia Hellqvist's engagement portrait looks strikingly similar to the Cambridges'

Indeed, the intimate pose also echoes the one struck by the Cambridges - and the one adopted by Carl Philip's younger sister Madeleine when she announced her own engagement to British banker, Chris O'Neil in 2012.

Carl Philip and Miss Hellqvist announced their engagement in June, following a four-year relationship that sparked outrage in Sweden when it first became public in 2009.

Miss Hellqvist, a former glamour model and reality TV star, had hit headlines four years earlier in 2005 after reaching the final of the scandalous sex and alcohol fuelled series, Paradise Hotel.

The show sees five men and five women stay in a hotel together and included scenes of Sofia kissing pornstar Jenna Jameson.

As a result, Queen Silvia, Prince Carl Philip's mother, didn't entirely approve of the match.

However, the Swedish royal family appear to have softened their stance in recent months, with Miss Hellqvist becoming a regular sight at family events.

Indeed, so complete is Miss Hellqvist's new-found acceptance, she appeared at the opening of the Swedish parliament with Prince Carl Philip last week.

The pair's story began after Miss Hellqvist met Carl Philip - third in line to the throne - in a club in 2009.

Since then, her wardrobe has had a royal makeover with the tight frocks and provocative ensembles of her reality star heyday thrown out and Duchess of Cambridge-style fitted shift dresses and court shoes in their place.

But Miss Hellqvist isn't the only one with a wild past. Carl Philip was once famous for his playboy ways and for preferring fast cars to royal duties.

The prince had been with his previous partner, PR executive Emma Pernald, for 10 years before they suddenly split in 2009. Before that, it was widely believed a wedding was on the cards.

In 2012, he hit the headlines over his 'Wild Summer' which included him being slapped during a night out in Cannes, hitting the Swedish party scene wearing an alien mask, losing his Gucci wallet and hitch-hiking his way to a motoring competition where he crashed his car in the first race.

Like his fiancée, he also appears to have mellowed in recent years and spoke glowingly of Miss Hellqvist following the proposal.

'I have the incredible honour of being engaged to this fantastic girl,' he said, adding: 'Sofia has said yes to sharing the rest of her life with me.'

For her part, Miss Hellqvist described the proposal as 'a fantastic surprise', she said, and said her initial response was apparently: 'oh wow!'

'I expected a totally normal day at work. I was amazed and a little bit shocked,' she added. 'Carl Philip is the most humble person I have ever met, which is what made me fall in the beginning.' 

Long term love: The couple looked blissfully happy as they watched the Swedish Open tennis in July

Celebrations: Shortly after the engagement was revealed, the pair attended Princess Victoria's birthday party

One thing noticeably different about Sofia is her all natural smile and slight gap tooth grin
