It's probably  totally to do with my age I'm sure, but I don't think of the Eighties as that old.

Big hair on our heads. Madonna in a state of undress. House music on the dancefloors. Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet on tour. 

I could be describing last weekend, let alone something that is in fact four decades old. But I am happy to commit that era to the past if it means Sky Sport's new documentary 'Chelsea: Black & Blue' can be seen as a truly historical document. 

Chelsea's first black footballer Paul Canoville has been the subject of documentary Chelsea: Black & Blue

Canoville was targeted by racists after signing for Chelsea in 1981 before making his debut a year later

BORN: England, March 4, 1962 (age 52)

1981-1986: Chelsea (79 lg apps, 11 gls)

1986-1987: Reading (16, 4)

1988-1989: Enfield (9, 2)

1990-1991: Maidenhead United (17, 3) 

Because it told the incredible story of Paul Canoville, the talented young winger who in 1982 became Chelsea's first black player. 

And in doing so, also told of the torrid time he had in that pioneering role; one which, as we go on to discover, was in fact crucial in the development of both the club and its supporters. 

Yet this is not all. Because although this was clearly a massive part of Paul's life and career, it paled in comparison to some of the other adversities that he has faced. 

Adversities that, as a viewer and a human being, you ultimately are delighted this incredible individual has gone on to overcome. In 'Chelsea: Black & Blue', Canoville proved himself more than eloquently capable of recalling how it was for him from the time he signed professional forms from his local club Hillingdon Borough in 1981. 

He talked vividly and emotionally, for example, about warming up as a sub for his debut at Crystal Palace the next year, and thinking 'are they for real?' as he heard a torrent of racial abuse. 

Then on turning and telling them to 'say that to my face', he discovered 'it was my own fans'. 

'All I wanted to do was get off the pitch,' he added, and this was only the beginning of how life was going to be as a pioneer at the club. A time that ended when 'one of their favourites called me a racist name. I didn't take it too well. And I was edged out.'

This 'favourite', although discussed, is never named in the documentary. In between Paul's heartfelt confessions are testimonials from other men who'd had a vested interest in Canoville's career. 

And they all gave a vivid context to the times in which Canoville was making his way in the game. 

DJ Trevor Nelson is a lifelong Chelsea fan and recalled walking down the Kings Road at this time with 'the National Front trying to recruit. Imagine how that felt being a little black kid'. 

Omid Djalili, who was also a regular at Stamford Bridge during these times, recalled 'Chelsea fans fighting each other'. While Pat Nevin, a team-mate of Canoville's, had seen and heard this hardcore of 'not fans...users of Chelsea Football Club', and chose to use a post match press conference to take a stand against the abuse. 

Ultimately though, Michael Duberry was able to talk in the documentary about 'the luxury' of just being able to be a footballer because of what Canoville had gone through. 

While he also pointed out that Paul should be 'acknowledged a lot more for shutting down and changing the way people see Chelsea.'

Yet for Canoville during the Eighties, kudos was the least of his priorities. Because it was the beginning of a period in his life that saw him disappear from the game prematurely through injury, go broke, turn to drugs, get clean, twice be diagnosed and beat cancer, and lose a son at just nine days old who 'died in my arms'. 

Yet in spite of, or more likely because of all of this, we discover at the end of 'Chelsea: Black & Blue' that he is now working in the community for his old club, mentoring and advising kids in school. Not only that, he is also going back to see his old team. 

Where one night, he told us, a fan approached him because he needed to apologise to Canoville for having been one of those racist abusers. With a tear in his eye, the former winger told us of how the fan said: 'I was ignorant. I was following my dad. I didn't know better. I realise now...and I tell my kids about racism.'

Paul said: 'I got to respect that. I do respect that.' It is a life-affirming story, and one that not only hopefully confirms that those tales from the Eighties are fundamentally a thing of the past, but also that Paul Canoville himself has a future that is well worth looking forward to.
