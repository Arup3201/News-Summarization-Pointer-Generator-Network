He may have made his name at Tottenham but Gareth Bale has admitted he grew up supporting their north London rivals Arsenal.

The Welsh winger joined Spurs from Southampton in 2007 and spent six years at the club before his world-record £86million transfer to Real Madrid.

Despite a slow start at White Hart Lane, Bale's remarkable development over his last three years in England saw him become a favourite with the club's fans.

But on Tuesday evening the 25-year-old jeopardised that status with Spurs supporters after comments he made regarding rivals Arsenal.

Speaking on Cadena SER radio show, he said: 'I used to actually like Arsenal a lot.

'But when I went to Tottenham I went away from Arsenal. Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira were amazing footballers.' 

Bale has enjoyed a mixed relationship with the fans at new club Real Madrid, and was recently accused of being selfish after failing to pass the ball to Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo.

But Bale brushed the issue aside, saying it had been blown out of proportion.

'All I can remember is going for the ball and feeling very focused on trying to score,' said Bale. 'I didn't see him, I think it would have been a difficult pass. I haven't spoken to Cristiano about not passing the ball.

'I don't know how much importance was given to it (by the media) but I'm sure people talk a lot about it. But it happens all the time on the football pitch in every team.'
