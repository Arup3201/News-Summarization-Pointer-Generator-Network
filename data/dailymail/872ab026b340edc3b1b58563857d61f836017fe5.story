A Harley Street doctor who
put a porn addict through 'total hell' by prescribing him an unlicensed
hallucinogenic drug failed to fully explain the risks of the experimental
treatment to him, a tribunal ruled.

Dr Peter
Brackenridge gave the drug, Ibogaine, to the 25-year-old man who was obsessed with
internet pornography.

The
patient paid more than £1,900 for the treatment, which was administered in Brackenridge's bedroom at his home in north London.

The
Australian-trained doctor claimed effects would be like 'floating on a river'
and that he would spend 36 hours in a 'waking but dreamlike state', the General
Medical Council heard.

But the
celibate addict, known as patient A, said it was a 'horrendous treatment', and
within minutes of taking the drug he felt 'everything had changed'.

He went
on to experience months of mental health problems, including insomnia, paranoia
and psychosis.

Brackenridge
now faces being banned from the profession after being found guilty of failing
to properly explain the risks of the drug and gain his patient's informed consent.

His
website 'failed to set out a single risk' associated with the drug, which is
banned in a number of countries, said panel chairman Dr Jack Crane.

'The panel
considered there to be an obligation upon you, as a registered medical
practitioner, to set out a balanced view of the risks and benefits associated
with the use of Ibogaine,' he said.

'This is
particularly important because the drug is unlicensed.'

Brackenridge ran a
website offering the controversial medicine and promised it could cure drug and
alcohol addiction, the hearing has been told.

Patient A first visited Dr Brackenridge at his Harley Street Clinic in February 2009 and paid £100 per counselling session and £1,900 for the Ibogaine

But the
medicine, which is derived from the root of an African plant, has been banned
in a number of countries (see box below) after being linked to patient deaths and has a
worrying catalogue of side effects.

Patient A
first visited Dr Brackenridge at his Harley Street Clinic in February 2009 for
a porn addiction, and paid £100 per counselling session and £1,900 for the
Ibogaine.

The addict
would watch hours and hours of internet pornography every night and could not
stop himself from doing so despite knowing it was unhealthy and that he was
'hooked'.

He was not
told of risks including insomnia, vomiting, cardiac arrest and serious allergic
reactions before being given the drug in Brackenridge's home.

The medic
only gave him a consent form listing previously unmentioned side effects just
before administering the drug on August 1, 2009.

Patient A
said: 'I was hallucinating, seeing things inside the eye of my mind and then I
didn't know where I was and didn't know what time it was.

'It was
horrible, I was panicking. I started having convulsions.

'My chest
was all over the place, I couldn't control it. After a while, it felt like my
heart was slowing down. It was
total hell really.'

Giving evidence, Brackenridge claimed the treatment is
'actually very safe', and could provide patients with a 'deeper experience' and
a 'window of freedom from that addiction'.

Ibogaine (seen above in powdered form) is an extract of the African shrub Tabernanthe iboga, a relative of the coffee plant.

In West
Africa, it is a well-known hallucinogen used in male rites of passage.

The drug is also used as a tool by hunters to increase awareness and allows them to 
remain very still for long periods.

Its
current legal status in the UK, and much of the rest of the world, is 
that of an unlicensed, experimental medication, and it is not therefore an 
offence to possess it, though to act as a distributor may be 
breaking the law.

Ibogaine is a restricted substance (possession is 
illegal) in some countries, including the U.S., Switzerland, Denmark, 
Sweden and Belgium.

The medic
said he had been prescribing the drug for about a year and insisted that
'practically all' of 19 deaths associated with it had been caused by other
medical ailments.

He said:
'It has been used for centuries by traditional people who tend to avoid
poisonous things that are harmful.

'Also, it
has been used by French and German workers in Africa, and it has been
prescribed in Europe since the early part of the last century as a
neuromuscular stimulant.

'There
isn't a licensed alternative for this.'

Brackenridge was found to have failed
to state that Ibogaine was an unlicensed drug and to set out possible risks in
a website advertising treatment with the drug.

The medic
admitted that he did not discuss alternative treatments that were licensed in
the UK, and did not inform the patient's GP about the treatment.

He further
failed to explain the risks adequately to Patient A before handing him a
consent form to sign on August 1, just before treatment began.

It meant
Brackenridge did not ensure that the addict understood the risks involved in
the treatment prior to prescribing the drug, and did not obtain his informed
consent, the panel ruled.

'The panel
notes that the risks set out on the consent form are almost exclusively
physical in nature,' said Dr Crane.

'The panel
noted from the documentation provided that there may be psychological risks
associated with treatment with Ibogaine. 

'Patient A denied being made
aware of some of these risks, both physical and psychological. 

'The panel
found that you had failed to ensure that patient A understood these risks.

Brackenridge
also inappropriately treated patient A at his home address on 1 August 2009, as
it did not have facilities for a 'medical or psychiatric emergency which could
have arisen' the panel ruled.

The medic
was cleared of 'acting inappropriately' by 'laughing at and belittling' the
patient and dismissing his concerns he might lose his job, as the panel said
there was not enough evidence to support the charges.

He was
also cleared of refusing to allow his mother to attend a session, which the
panel accepted would not be good practice.

But
Brackenridge was found to have inappropriately refused to meet with Patient A's
parents, who were waiting outside his house, after a consultation on October
12, 2009.

'By October 12, 2009, there had been a clear deterioration in Patient A's mental health
of which you were aware,' said Dr Crane.

'The
parents had serious concerns regarding their son's wellbeing to which you
should have listened.' T

he panel must now decide if the doctor is fit to
continue practising unrestricted.

The
hearing continues.
