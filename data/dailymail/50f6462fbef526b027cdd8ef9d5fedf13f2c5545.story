It is one of the most iconic beat-em-ups ever created. And now, after laying dormant for years, Killer Instinct is ready to explode on to the next-generation Xbox One.

But why did we have to wait so long? MailOnline talks to Torin Rettig, a producer at Microsoft Studios.

What efforts have been made to ensure this version of Killer Instinct remains faithful to the original?

TR: From the very beginning staying faithful to the original games has been a top priority in development. It's tricky, especially after almost two decades to bring a franchise back. You need to stay true to the original, but you also need to update it into a modern title.

Killer Instinct was a definitive fighting game back in the 1990's. It's style, visuals and gameplay were very unique.

Brutal: With a classic cast, huge combos and an awesome soundtrack, KI is shaping nicely

Things such as the wild, diverse cast of characters, massive combos, combo breakers and the iconic announcer were unique to KI and made it a blast to play.

It was key to us to bring all of those elements back and judging by the response we've been pretty successful so far. We've got the classic cast, incredible combos, combo breakers, an awesome soundtrack and we even brought back the original announcer from the previous games.

However, while the visual style and other aesthetics were very much associated with that time, fighting game mechanics have come a long way in the intervening years.

We also knew it was really important to update Killer Instinct as a modern fighting game for a next gen console.

We updated the visuals and style and expanded upon the unique combat system. In addition to combo breakers, we've added counter breakers, which break combo breakers, shadow counters, combo lockouts and more. A host of new features and systems that not only make it a singular fighting game experience, but also really hype and exciting one.

Are there any new characters you can talk about?

TR: We've been steadily announcing characters since our E3 announcement. The latest two are Sadira and the classic character, Orchid.

Sadira is a whole new addition to the Killer Instinct franchise. We thought it was really important if we were going to create a new game that we expand the Killer Instinct universe and add a new character in our initial release.

We worked really hard to make sure she fit thematically within KI, but also that she offered something new in terms of gameplay that was different from any characters in our opening roster, and also different from any other KI character in the original titles as well.

Thematically we definitely think Sadira fits within the Killer Instinct universe. She's got a very cool spider motif and abilities.

This is reflected in her arena as well, with the spiders, webs, captured items and other elements. We'll be revealing more about her story later, but she's the leader of a clan of assassins and they're targeting other Killer Instinct characters. This will tie into the overall story in a cool way.

Ambitious: Microsoft hopes that KI's matchmaking will be super-fast and as seamless as possible

In terms of gameplay she's unique in that she has great control of space, high mobility and really excels in the air combat.

She has a double jump, which she can use to modulate her attack and defense, air daggers with special properties and a fast wall bound that she can use to confuse and set up cool attack patterns. She's unique in the roster in terms of these kinds of abilities and she's tons of fun to play.

As for Orchid we'll be revealing more info about her soon. We were super excited to announce such an iconic character and can't wait to show more.

Will there be any extra downloadable content aside from the characters themselves?

TR: Yes definitely! And that's a big part of how we're launching the game and updating it. In addition to characters players can also download alternate costumes for each character and accessories for each character's base costume and their alternate costumes.

The cool thing about the accessories is that they're freely interchangeable with each other, so you can mix and match to create unique looks for characters.

In addition to these types of downloadable content we will also be updating the game and releasing new features for the game post launch.

We're envisioning the Killer Instinct as more like a service where we want to continually update the game and engage with the community to help guide what those updates will be. We want to keep releasing content as long as players keep playing.

How has development benefited from being an Xbox One title? Was there ever consideration to make this a 360 title?

TR: Xbox One has several new features that enhance the experience for games on the console in really compelling ways. Outside of enhanced next gen graphics, in Killer Instinct we're using the Xbox One's capabilities for enhanced matchmaking.

Our goal is to make matchmaking as fast, seamless and ubiquitous as possible. We want players to be able to find matches throughout the experience in the game, not just when they're in online mode. When a match is found we want players to be able to jump into the match from wherever they are, whether they're in practice mode, training mode or any single player mode.

We also want players to be able to search for matches even during an active multiplayer match. Where ever you are we want you to be able to get some online competition going.

Worth the wait: but sadly PS4 owners and those opting to stay with current gen won't be able to play it

Another very cool feature unique to Xbox One is how it can map controllers and settings to individual players. It will remember the controller button mapping and settings for an individual as soon as they pick up the controller.

For a fighting game this is really cool. You often have several friends over playing at the same time and swapping controllers back and forth. Automatically switching button mapping when a new player picks up the controller makes the hot swap way faster and seamless.

This is great for any game, but especially a fighting game where players have their favourite button settings.

In terms of the target console, Killer Instinct is definitely an Xbox One title. We have no plans for other versions to announce.
