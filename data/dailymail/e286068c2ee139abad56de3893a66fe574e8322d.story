Worrying: Andrew Peat, pictured, and Amy Willett, sent sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl on a social networking site in an attempt to meet up with her and have sex

A couple sent sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl on a social networking site in an attempt to meet up with her and have sex.

Andrew Peat, 27, and his girlfriend Amy Willett, 22, sent messages to the girl by email, phone and on the social networking site.

Many of the messages were sexually explicit, and included plans to meet the victim and entice her into sex.

But after the teenage girl’s mother found out, she contacted the police who arrested the couple.

Peat of, Hyde, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to causing a child to engage in sexual activity, causing a child to watch a sexual act and nine counts of making indecent images.

At Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court today he was sentenced to two years in prison.

Amy Willett of Cheadle Hulme pleaded guilty to causing a child to engage in sexual activity, and was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for two years.

In June 2012, Peat approached the victim, from the West Midlands, on the social networking site. She had stated her age clearly on her profile page.

Within minutes of the conversation, Peat’s messages were of a sexually explicit nature, and he also stated that he and his then girlfriend were willing to meet her.

A few days later Willett herself was in contact with the girl, and contact between all three took place.

During their contact, Peat also sent images of a sexual nature to the victim.

After Peat’s arrest, nine indecent images of children were found on his home computer.

Detective Constable Phil Kennedy said: 'Both defendants knew they were in touch with a 15-year-old girl, but that did not stop them from their campaign of online grooming.

'The discovery of nine indecent images at Peat’s house illustrates that he had no issues with child sex offending. Indecent images of this nature endorse the abuse of children.

'Today’s outcome illustrates that Greater Manchester Police, working closely with partner agencies such as the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP), is committed to tackling the issue of online abuse.'
