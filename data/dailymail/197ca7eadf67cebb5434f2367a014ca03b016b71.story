Labour frontbencher: Shabana Mahmood has been accused of ‘encouraging mob rule’, after she joined an anti-Israel protest which forced a Sainsbury’s supermarket to close

A Labour frontbencher was accused of encouraging mob rule last night after she boasted of taking part in an anti-Israel protest that forced a supermarket to close.

Shabana Mahmood lay in the street outside a Sainsbury’s store in Birmingham alongside dozens of pro-Palestine campaigners, protesting against the fact that it was ‘stocking goods from illegal settlements’.

Her ‘direct action’ forced the supermarket to close for several hours on a busy Saturday, the MP claimed. She then used YouTube to brag about her actions, calling for a boycott of Israeli goods – in direct contravention of Labour policy.

But a Sainsbury’s spokesman disputed Miss Mahmood’s account of what happened, saying the store was closed for ‘less than 30 minutes.’

Last night the Muslim MP, who speaks for the party on tax and growth policy, was accused of ‘stirring up tensions’ by Jewish leaders. They said the Birmingham Ladywood MP was promoting public disorder, and branded her behaviour ‘completely inappropriate’.

Labour said Ed Miliband had spoken to Miss Mahmood, who told him she does not support a boycott of Israel. But critics said this did not go far enough and called on her to apologise.

Simon Johnson, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, said: ‘It is completely inappropriate for a Member of Parliament to promote public disorder that forced a supermarket to close. We believe that she has been made aware of her party’s opposition to boycotts and has back-pedalled, but an apology is yet to be heard.’

Vivian Wineman, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ‘Such rabble rousing is extremely irresponsible.’

In her YouTube video on August 2, Miss Mahmood said: ‘I’m just here, it’s Saturday afternoon, at a peaceful protest outside a Sainsbury’s store in central Birmingham.  It’s half past three and the store has actually just shut as a result.

Caught on camera: In a video posted on YouTube Miss Mahmood boasted of her involvement in the protest in the Sainsbury’s store in central Birmingham on August 2

Action: Miss Mahmood was involved in the ‘direct action’ protest which saw dozens of pro-Palestine campaigners lie down outside the store in Birmingham city centre, forcing it to close

‘That’s about four-and-a-half hours of 
business that Sainsbury’s is losing for supporting the goods from the 
Israeli settlements that are illegal under international law.’

Her
 comments are in direct opposition to Labour policy. In March last year,
 Mr Miliband told the Jewish Chronicle he thought boycotts of Israel 
were ‘totally wrong’. Since then, several other supermarkets have been 
targeted. They include a Tesco in Birmingham where protesters stormed 
the store, threw food and fought with police.

Tory
 MP Mike Freer said: ‘Once again we see the ugly side of Labour and the 
weakness of Miliband. His unwillingness or inability to rein in a front 
bench spokesman who is encouraging these sort of targeted attacks speaks
 volumes.

MP: Critics have demanded that Miss Mahmood, pictured after she was elected in May 2010, apologise

‘For any Parliamentarian to encourage mob rule as a way of protesting is shameful.’

A
 Labour spokesman said: ‘Ed Miliband has been clear that Labour does not
 support boycotts of Israel and we resolutely oppose the isolation of 
Israel. 

‘Labour remains committed to a comprehensive peace based on
 a two-state solution, international law and a secure Israel alongside a
 secure and viable state of Palestine. Having spoken to her, Shabana has
 made clear that she does not support calls for a boycott of Israel but 
supports the proper labelling of goods from the region.’

Speech: At a pro-Gaza rally in Hyde Park on August 9, she told the audience of tens of thousands of people to take 'practical action' to join in the Israeli boycott

Outspoken: In a video posted online she told the crowd: 'We managed to close that store for five hours at peak time on a Saturday. This is how we can make a difference.'

Anger: Jewish groups said the Birmingham Ladywood MP was guilty of 'promoting public disorder', and branded her behaviour 'completely inappropriate'

Jewish 
community leaders have warned that the targeting of  supermarkets risks 
importing  Middle Eastern violence into the UK. Over the weekend, 
Sainsbury’s removed kosher foods from a  central London store amid 
fears  it would be ransacked by demonstrators.

Last week police were 
attacked and stock hurled around a Tesco  in Birmingham. Protesters said
 the store was targeted as it sells produce from Israel. Britain has 
seen an increase in anti-Semitic incidents since the outbreak of 
fighting in Gaza earlier this summer.

Birmingham-born Miss Mahmood’s 
family hails from Azad Kashmir, part of the disputed province held by 
Pakistan. The 33-year-old, one of the first female Muslim MPs, is a 
member of the all-party Parliamentary group on Kashmir.
