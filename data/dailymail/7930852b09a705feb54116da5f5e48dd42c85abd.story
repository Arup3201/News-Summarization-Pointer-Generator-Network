After she appeared on The Tonight Show wearing an unflattering nude jumpsuit, Gwyneth Paltrow was lambasted for her choice of outfit. 

The garment clung to all the wrong places prompting fashion critics to ask, 'is this the actress's worst outfit yet?'

It's a tough one to call as there are certainly a number to chose from when it comes to Gwyneth's fashion fails.

Not dressed to impress: Gwyneth wore this unflattering £1,000 Elie Saab jumpsuit on The Tonight Show

Worst outfit yet? Gwyneth drew criticism from fashionistas for the outfit that clung to all the wrong places

On the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Gwyneth stepped out to greet the crowd with a huge grin...but it was a shame that Elie Saab jumpsuit wasn't a huge success.

Fashion Finder wasn't convinced on the piece. It seemed to cling in all the wrong places and the style did the star no favours.

But that doesn't mean that blush jumpsuits are out of the question. Because while Gwyneth may have made a fashion faux-pas with her ill-fitting piece, you don't have to.

We have been scouting around for some alternatives and we think we've come up trumps. If you've got a big budget, then the Valentino piece gets the thumbs up and what's more, is that it's got almost 75% off - so get shopping ladies if you want a designer bargain.

But Boohoo and Missguided have great cheap and cheerful options available, so don't feel priced out - there's something for everyone.

Whether it has been revealing more than intended on the red carpet or taking a trend too far, the 42-year-old has often struggled to hone her style over the years.

Last night's mishap in a £1,000 Elie Saab-designed pink jumpsuit - in which she was compared to a 'naked mole rat' - isn't the first time Gwyneth has made waves in the fashion world.

From her Academy Awards appearance in 2002, dressed in a gothic full-length ruffled black skirt with a see-through top - and no bra, showing off her nipples - to the sheer panelled Antonio Berardi gown worn to the Iron Man 3 premiere in 2013, with which she wasn't able to wear knickers, there have been many fashion faux pas. 

Floral faux pas: At the Berlin Film Festival in 2000, the actress looked older than her years thanks to this frumpy purple dress with flowers - and a lace cardigan attached

Regrets: Gwyneth said these Oscar looks were her worst. In 2002, she wore this gothic Alexander McQueen gown that flashed her nipples, left, while 2002's Calvin Klein choice, right, 'wasn't Oscars material'

However, Gwyneth, who is 'consciously uncoupled' from husband Chris Martin, doesn't always get it wrong. In 2012, she was crowned the World's Best Dressed Woman by People magazine.

Her stylist Elizabeth Saltzman remarked: 'She doesn't do fringe. She has a uniform. It’s simple, not overdone.’

Even Gwyneth admits she's got in wrong at times. On her lifestyle website Goop, she wrote that 'two that come to mind' are 'looks I wore to the Oscars in 2000 and 2002.' 

She explained: 'The first is the Calvin Klein. It's an okay dress but not Oscars material. I chose it because I wanted to disappear that year. Also, the goth Alexander McQueen I wore a few years later. 

'There were a few issues; I still love the dress itself but I should have worn a bra and I should have just had simple beachy hair and less makeup. Then, it would have worked as I wanted it to - a little bit of punk at the Oscars.' 

Here, we reveal some of the Oscar winner's worst looks. 

Too revealing: Gwyneth admitted this sheer panelled Antonio Berardi gown worn to the Iron Man 3 premiere in 2013 was a 'disaster' because it couldn't be worn with knickers. 'Let's just say everyone went scrambling for a razor,' she said of her preparations to wear it on the red carpet

At last year's Golden Globes, the actress wore this unflattering dress which looked more like a baggy jumper

Heading to a night out in London in 2013, Gwyneth has a strange belt accessory adding to her too fussy outfit

Unusually covered up at the Met Ball in 2013 in a vintage Valentino gown, this shade is too bright and the nude strip looks strange on the actress who also clashes with the red carpet

When pregnant in 2004 at an awards event in Las Vegas, left, and then at the Golden Globes in 2006 in a Balenciaga gown, right, Gwyneth's baggy dresses that made her look frumpy

Toga party: Gwyneth, pictured right at the Cannes Film Festival in 2008, appears to be wearing a bed sheet, while the white mini dress worn to a party in Miami during the same year, left, flashes too much flesh

Inspired by Superman? Gwyneth wears underwear as outwear at a 2008 film premiere in Paris in another daring Antonio Berardi-designed dress

Cheap look: A dress exposing her side paired with high black heels creates an outfit reminiscent of a stripper when she attended a Country Strong film screening in 2010

Keen to show off the body she works hard for: An odd panel is cut out of the centre of her blue dress, left, worn to a charity event in 2014. Right, a dress worn to the 2010 CMA Awards is slashed in too many places

It appears someone has been at Gwyneth's clothes with the scissors again as this 2013 LBD, worn to a gala in New York, is cut away too much at the shoulders and chest

On the Cannes red carpet in a Stella McCartney gown, left, in 2008 that is slashed to the navel with unusual ribbons. Right, wearing a pink dress with a giant bow that overwhelms her look at a UNICEF benefit also 2008

No wow factor: Gwyneth looks like a WAG in this short, silver dress and sky high heels worn to the Met Ball in 2007, which also flashed some side boob

Disco ball gone wrong: A shiny, silver party dress is not complemented by these grey tights

Not office-attire: In an attempt to look smart, Gwyneth wears a suit jacket but it looks ridiculous paired with shorts at her book launch left, while her trousers, right, are too tight and the top has odd ruffle detail 

Hangs off her: This vintage Yves St Laurent dress worn to an awards dinner in 2008 is another frumpy look that hides the Oscar winner's physique and make her look stocky

Fashion fails: This dress worn to a 2004 film premiere pushes her cleavage up too high and looks cheap, left, while to the Oscars in 2011, she wore this Calvin Klein dress that looked like she was wrapped in tin foil 

The dress, left, worn to the Country Strong premiere in 2010 is so stretched the fabric has ripped, while she has the legs to pull off the LBD on the right at the Ironman premiere in 2008 but it's a little on the short side

Not the best dressed: She won the Oscar in 1999 but not everyone was a fan of her Ralph Lauren pink gown that appeared to be too big for her and made her look washed out

It looks like she forgot to put a top on at the Vogue Fashion Awards after party in 2001
