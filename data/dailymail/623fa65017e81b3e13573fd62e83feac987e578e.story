New 3D images of Pablo Picasso have been discovered nearly six decades after they were first taken.

These three pairs of images, which appear in three dimensions when seen through a special viewer or glasses, were taken by French photographer Robert Mouzillat in 1957.

In the photographs - taken at the height of Picasso's fame - the artist poses in his Cannes house in a stetson, and holds a cigarette and a drink in his cluttered studio.

The never-before-seen pictures of Picasso were taken by Robert Mouzillat - the inventor of the 3D camera - in 1957 at the height of the artist's fame

Mouzillat invented the 3D camera, which uses two lenses to take pairs of pictures from slightly different angles, and chose the 75-year-old Picasso for one of his first projects.

In order to view them in 3D, viewers are supposed to focus on a point halfway between their face and the picture, bringing the two photos together in the centre.

Included in the collection of images are Picasso's biographer John Richardson, poet Jean Cocteau, surrealist artist Jaime Sabartes and Picasso's wife Jacqueline Rocque.

His pets, including Lump the dachshund, Yan the boxer and Esmerelda the goat, are also pictured.

The camera uses two lenses to take pictures from slightly different angles, and can be viewed in 3D by 'defocusing' your eyes so the two pictures appear as one image in the centre

The pictures were discovered by Anthony Sturgis, the director of the Holburne Museum in Bath, where the photographs will go on display.

He was invited to Jersey by Mouzillat's daughter Elizabeth Mouzillat Jowett to view 100,000 images stored on the archives there.

Among pictures of monuments, French landscapes, nudes, and the inside of the ElysÃ©e Palace, he spotted the images of Picasso.

Included in the collection, which is to go on display in Bath, are images of Picasso's studio (pictured), his wife and several of his beloved pets - including Esmeralda the goat

Speaking to the Guardian, Sturgis said: 'It is not every day that one finds a group of photographs of Picasso that no one has seen before.'

Among his favourites were the ones of Picasso's studio. He added: 'It really is rather amazing. They are my favourite images. You get a sense of the space and the room and this mix of his art, other people's art and then just clutter... rubbish.'

Sereoscopic Photographs of Pablo Picasso is at the Holburne Museum, Bath, from February 22 to June 1.

The slightly differing perspective in each photograph gives the illusion of depth when viewers 'defocus' their eyes so separate images become one

In order to make the illusion work, focus on a point roughly halfway between the images and your eyes until the pictures merge together
