Jamie Redknapp has taken on the 'ice bucket challenge' before quickly nominating his dad Harry.

Sportsmail columnist Redknapp was on holiday in Spain when he accepted the challenge from former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen.

And, never one to shirk a challenge, former Liverpool and England midfielder Redknapp took two full ice-buckets in the face.

After a short introductory message, our columnist is drenched by freezing water before falling backwards into a swimming pool during a European family break.

Redknapp, 41, then immediately nominated his father, the manager of Queens Park Rangers, 67. He also called on his Sportsmail and Sky Sports colleague Jamie Carragher and comedian John Bishop, with whom he stars on Sky One's A League Of Their Own, to take on the icy challenge. 

His  nominees have 24 hours to take on their own ice-buckets, according to the rules, and Carragher did not hang around.

The Anfield legend took on the challenge from his bath tub, before nominating Sportsmail columnist Adrian Durham, Everton chairman Bill Kenwright and and ITV host Adrian Chiles. 

The #IceBucketChallenge is the latest charity craze to take the internet by storm, with people pouring iced water over their heads in a bid to raise money for charity.

The craze began in the US where the ALS Association - a motor neurone disease charity network - said it had received 22.9 million US dollars (£13.8 million) in donations compared to 1.9 million US dollars (£1.1m) during the same time period last year (July 29 to August 19).

Coleen Rooney, wife of England striker Wayne, performed the challenge earlier on Wednesday after being nominated by her husband's former England team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips for the challenge, and after being drenched called upon Piers Morgan and Sheree Murphy - Harry Kewell's wife - to step up next.

Golf stars Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods did it together, taking it in turns to pour the iced water over each others' heads.
