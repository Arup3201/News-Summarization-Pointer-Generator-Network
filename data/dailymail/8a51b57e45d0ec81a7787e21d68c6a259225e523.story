A Pointer called Major has been identified by historians as the first 'pedigree' dog.

The team, from the University of Manchester, found a description of the dog in an 1865 edition of the Victorian journal, The Field.

It is believed that this was the first time that an attempt had been made to define a dog breed standard based on the animal’s physical form.

John Henry Walsh, who wrote under the pseudonym 'Stonehenge', paved the way for the pedigree dog breeds we know today with his description of Major (pictured)

John Henry Walsh, who wrote under the
pseudonym ‘Stonehenge’, paved the way for the pedigree dog breeds we 
know today by creating a system of giving scores for different parts of 
the dog’s body.

His aim was to solve the bitter disputes that were brewing over the seemingly arbitrary decisions of judges at dog shows which could see a dog win a class one week and then come last the next.

In September 1865, Stonehenge published a classification for the Pointer which gave its head and neck 30 points, frame and general symmetry 25, legs and feet 20, quality and stern 15, and colour and coat 10.

The historians who discovered Major are based at the Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine and the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures – both at the University of Manchester.

Professor Michael Worboys, who was involved in the research, said: ‘The standard set by Major must surely be one of the most important milestones in the 6,000-year-old relationship between canines and man.

The pointer - experts say it may have been the first 'modern' dog breed defined by its physical form

‘As dogs came to be defined as 'breeds', they were bred for greater conformity to breed standards, which meant more inbreeding, and more health problems as dogs were bred from a smaller gene pool.

‘Stonehenge’s classifications set in chain a process where dogs were re-imagined, redesigned and remade.’

Dr Julie-Marie Strange added: ‘Stonehenge was so impressed by Major when he saw drawings of the dog – and heard it had won a prize at a Birmingham show – he devised the classification.

‘There’s a historical theme in the way many of these breeds were created. For example, though bull baiting had been banned in 1830, the Bulldog was bred to form considered to be ideal for grappling with a bull, for example, a protruding lower jaw to grab the soft nose of bull.’

Before the 1860s, types of dogs were defined by what they did, not how they looked. 

Pointers were gun dogs, valued and bred for their ability to find game and, though a recognisable type, came in a variety of sizes and colours. But in the show ring they were expected to have a defined shape that aspired to the ideal set out in the breed standard.

Major signalled a new age where dogs were increasingly bred for their form and from their pedigree.

The emphasis on conformation to breed types spread rapidly to other countries, where British dog shows were emulated and British dogs imported as foundational breed stock.

Dr Neil Pemberton said: ‘Though Stonehenge’s classification isn’t used today, its principle of defining a breed and judging by conformation will be the main criterion in the show ring at Cruft’s this week.’
