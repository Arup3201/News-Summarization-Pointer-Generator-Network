Two friends have died after one was shot dead in a struggle over a handgun and the other then turned the gun on himself.

Witnesses report one man was trying to disarm another in the incident that occurred early on Sunday morning in Willowbrook, Los Angeles, California.

The men knew each other and the shootings did not seem to have been caused by an argument, according to Lieutenant Eddie Hernandez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

'It sounds like it could have been an accidental discharge,' Hernandez said, adding that the 'shooting of the individual himself could have been deliberate'.

The victim and the man who shot himself have been named locally as Jerrod Taylor and Dominique Barnett, with the KTLA.com website carrying pictures of the men that are said to have been supplied by family members.

Police responded to reports of the shooting in the early hours of Sunday in the 400 block of East 138th Street, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Witnesses told investigators that two men involved in the shooting were 'hanging out' with others in front of a house, reports nbclosangeles.com.

When one man pulled out a handgun, another man who lived at the house tried to take it off him, officials said.
