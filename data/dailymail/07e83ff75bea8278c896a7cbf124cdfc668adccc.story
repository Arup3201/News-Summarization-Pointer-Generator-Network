A pregnant woman and her husband were forced to sleep in the car park of an Auckland motel after the receptionist said he had no record of their booking.

Unfortunately for Lucy and Gary Best, they had failed to check the TripAdvisor reviews of Epson Motor Inn before they decided to stay there.

The couple, from Kerikeri in New Zealand, may have decided to book in somewhere else had they spent some time researching their accommodation.

Complaints from past guests range from mould in the bathroom and unpainted walls to blood on the bed sheets.

Lucy Best and her husband Gary were forced to sleep in their car after the motel said there was no record

‘I thought I was lucky to find somewhere because it was one of a very few that were available,’ Mrs Best told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I'm not fussy so at $75 a night it sounded reasonable and within distance.’

But when the pair arrived on February 21, they were told the motel was booked out despite Mrs Best having a 'full confirmation' receipt as proof when they went to check in.

'The guy at reception looked confused and said there was no booking for Lucy Best,' Mrs Best said.

'He then gave me a book of motels in the area and told me I should call around.

'I was devastated and it was our first night out together without our two-year-old son since May 2014 so it was rewarding but I ended up in tears trying to find accommodation.'

The photo advertised by Epsom Motor Inn doesn't appear to add up, according to previous guests

Kel K who stayed at the motel with his wife recently said his room had 'wet carpet with a light fur of mould on it' (left) and 'unfinished repair in the bathroom' (right)

Another guest, KarolynTimarkos, said the motel should 'invest in exit mould' after staying in an 'unclean' room (left) and old rubbish left behind by previous guests

The 29-year-old said she spent the next few hours scouring through the phone book but the couple had no luck.

'I called every motel, hotel and hostel - while trying not to sob over the phone but every single one said they were fully booked out because of the concert in town,' Mrs Best said.

'We ran out of time because we had to meet up with some friends who had flown in from the UK and then it was time to head to the gig.

'My husband bought some bath towels and we agreed it was looking likely we were to sleep in the truck.'

The couple found a quiet cul-de-sac and camped inside their four-wheel-drive overnight.

‘It was the worst night’s sleep I’ve ever had,’ Mrs Best said.

‘I am half way through pregnancy and my husband is 1.8 metres tall.

‘There isn't enough words to describe the anger and upset I felt as it totally ruined what should've been an exciting and happy weekend.

‘To get no offer of help was disgusting, having worked in customer support myself I was in shock.

‘But I do feel like I’ve dodged the bullet after reading those horrible reviews on Trip Advisor.’

Mrs Best said she was left in tears after spending hours trying to find another accommodation but had no luck 

Motel manager Richie Chen told Daily Mail Australia he feels 'terribly sorry' for Mrs Best and has offered 'free of charge' accommodation.

'We've done what we could,' Chen said

'Something went wrong on our website and it was something I couldn't fix. I couldn't just ask someone to move out and give the room to her - we don't work like that.

'She was never charged when she made the booking but we have already provided her a complimentary - free of charge accommodation - so everything will be paid for. 

'I'm not in a position to comment on the condition of the motel but all I can say is I've done what I can as a manager.' 

An Auckland Council spokesman told Daily Mail Australia there were no records of complaints but the council will be investigating the motel. 

The 29-year-old mother said it was the first time in almost a year to spend quality time with her husband Gary

This guest claimed after a ' poor night’s sleep' - he experienced 'a horrible chesty feeling' and the 'taste of mould in our mouths after breathing in that disgusting air' overnight

Mrs Best and her husband were not the only ones who experienced a bad encounter.

Another guest, penned under ‘Sandy59979’ from New Zealand, thought she was entering a ‘demolition site’ after claiming she had fount piles of rubbish littered outside the motel.

‘Worse to come inside, mould in the showers etc., towel rail held onto wall with blocks of unpainted wood, windows that didn't close, furniture that was very dirty, and yes stains on the linen,’ Sandy59979 posted on Trip Advisor.

‘If I hadn't pre-paid I would not have stayed there. I had to park my car almost up to the door of the unit as I felt someone would hit my car trying to get past.

‘Then I thought I could take my mind off the situation by watching a little telly with a large glass of wine but alas the remote had no back and the batteries were Sellotape in not allowing for very easy operation.

‘Re the room service etc. that had been advertised on the website, forget it, if it existed I felt the health department would need to be involved. Never have I experienced such a disgusting "motel ".’

One guest took to the Trip Advisor page, claiming they had found bloodstains and damaged parts of the motel

Madjik posted: 'rusty light shades in the bathroom' that didn't work and moulds along the broke-door fridge

Another guest, 'Kel K', who stayed at the motel with his wife ahead of the Cricket World Cup claimed they had ‘noticed a strong smell something like mould and cigarette smoke’ inside their room.

‘We noticed one of the lights wouldn’t work, the fan wouldn’t work, the aircon [sic] wouldn’t work and we could only get one TV channel. There was also a stifling smell of mould in the room.

‘We found a double bed had been moved to cover a large wet mouldy patch of carpet caused by the aircon dripping inside the wall onto the carpet.

Madjik found stains on her spreadsheets as well as droplets of blood during her stay in November 2014

Sandy said she had found 'moulds in the shower', 'unpainted wood' and 'windows that didn't close'

Other guests found cupboard falling apart inside their room (left) and mould and dirt around the fridge (right)

Another guest found a 'mouldy sopping wet bedside cabinet' and a broken curtain with a missing clip

‘On moving the bed we found the patch was huge (larger than the double bed) and very wet and mouldy and stunk.

‘This had been like this for some time because the skirting was badly discoloured and the bedside cabinet next to the bed has swelled up like a balloon and was mouldy as well.

‘As a result we woke after a very poor night’s sleep with a horrible chesty feeling and the taste of mould in our mouths after breathing in that disgusting air all night.'
