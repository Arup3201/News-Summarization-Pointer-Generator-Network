To those who live in the tiny village of Sandringham in Norfolk, Christmas brings more than just a visit from St. Nick.

With the Queen in residence just over a mile away, it also brings a motley collection of press and well-wishers – as well as the royal family itself.

Luckily for the villagers, they’ve had nearly two centuries to get used to it – and as these striking images reveal, very little has changed.

The pictures, which have been taken from the Royal Archives, reveal festive celebrations that manage to be both familiar while being grander than most of us will ever experience.

And if the modern royal family prefers to dial down the grandeur in favour of family celebrations and amusing joke presents, it certainly wasn’t always so.

Queen Victoria, whose husband Prince Albert introduced the festive fir to the UK in 1841, was partial to a sizeable tree as Ernst Becker’s 1857 lithograph reveals.

Heavily laden with candles and surrounded by family pictures, it’s every inch a tree fit for a Queen or, indeed, an Empress as Victoria by then was.

According to the Royal Collection Trust there are approximately 10 Christmas trees at Windosr castle this year, locations include St George's Hall, the Crimson Drawing Room, and in the China Corridor

But while the current Queen is no stranger to an impressive pine, her 20ft specimen takes pride of place at Sandringham, while Queen Victoria, in the early days of her reign at least, preferred to celebrate at Windsor.

Not that Windsor Castle is a tree-free zone, as Royal Collection Trust curator Sally Goodsir explains.

‘There are approximately 10 trees along the visitor route this year,’ she reveals. ‘Locations include St George's Hall, the Crimson Drawing Room, in the China Corridor and in the Waterloo Chamber.’

Planning the festive décor takes approximately six months while putting everything up takes three days, with much of the work done at night.

The toughest job of all though, involves the 60ft spruce that dominates St George’s Hall come December.

‘It requires 2500 twinkling lights,’ adds Goodsir. ‘Between 500 and 600 decorations are placed on it, and long ladders are required to reach the top.’

But the vast spruce isn’t the only striking addition made to Windsor Castle’s already impressive collection of artefacts.

Another, the Christmas table laid out in the State Dining Room, gives a flavour of how the big day would have been celebrated while Queen Victoria was still alive.

'The special table display in the State Dining Room at Windsor Castle evokes a sense of how the royal family celebrated Christmases past,’ explains Goodsir, who masterminded the set-up.

‘Set with the magnificent silver-gilt Grand Service commissioned by George IV, it also includes a centrepiece which Prince Albert designed, which features four of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's favourite pet dogs.'

Considerably grander, in short, than today’s incarnation. But then, Windsor Castle, with its 1,000 rooms and a history that began with William the Conqueror, is itself considerably grander than the ‘homely’ Sandringham.

That came into the royal family in 1862 and is only one of two palaces – the other being Balmoral – personally owned by the Queen herself.

Originally intended to be the marital home of the then Edward, Prince of Wales and his Danish wife, Princess Alexandra, it swiftly became a much-loved family residence.

The current house on the site is also new in comparison to Windsor. While that began life as a motte and bailey castle built by William the Conqueror, Sandringham was designed by Norfolk architect AJ Humbert and completed in 1870.

A ballroom was added in 1881 and a guest wing in the early 1890s, although that wasn’t enough for its owner who, right up until the moment he died in 1910, ‘was continually improving his domain, repairing churches, spending money on the place in one way or another,’ according to a letter written by a friend.

With Edward VII gone, ownership of the house passed to George V who described it as ‘the place I love better than anywhere in the world’ and began the tradition of spending Christmas there.

It was also George who began another royal Christmas tradition – the monarch’s annual speech to the nation.

The first Christmas message was broadcast to what was then the British Empire was in 1932, with George calling for nations to work towards peace from Sandringham’s ‘business room’.

It was a tradition enthusiastically embraced by his successor George VI who became king shortly after his brother Edward VIII abdicated weeks before Christmas 1936.

Edward had been on the throne for less than eight months before standing aside in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

Like his father George V, who had been at Sandringham when he died on the 20th January 1936, George VI, who was both born and died at the house, was devoted to his Norfolk home.

Indeed, so happy was he at Sandringham, he fondly wrote of it: ‘I have always been happy here and I love the place.’

Under George VI, Christmas at the house became more of a family affair, with his children, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, enjoying a succession of happy Christmases at the house – all of which bear more than a little resemblance to the modern incarnation.

Then, as now, guests begin arriving on the 23rd although most descend on Christmas Eve itself. The tree, a 20ft spruce taken from the 20,000-acre Sandringham Estate, is decorated by the younger members of the family – supervised by the Queen.

After tea, the presents are unwrapped – a nod to the Queen Alexandra, who introduced the Danish tradition after her marriage to the future Edward VII in 1863.

A formal black-tie dinner follows, with festivities ending at around 10pm when the women withdraw for coffee while the men stay on to enjoy a glass of port.

Christmas morning brings a trip to the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Sandringham village where the royals greet well-wishers and villagers before continuing on into church.

The Queen, who remains devout, goes every day during the Christmas period, although, as last year showed, doesn’t always stop to chat.

Afterwards comes lunch, served at 1pm on the dot, with traditional festive fare, including a turkey raised on the Sandringham Estate, on the menu.

The Queen then withdraws to watch her Christmas message alone, while the rest of the family gather around the TV to watch.

This year's had the theme of reconciliation and included a cameo role for Game of Thrones and Sinn Fein politician Martin McGuinness.

Both featured in the Queen's historic visit to Belfast in June, which also included the monarch's first selfie, courtesy of 14-year-old schoolboy, Jack Surgenor. 

On Boxing Day comes another royal tradition - Prince Philip's annual shoot - which will see members of the family, usually including the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, brave the cold for the chance to bag a pheasant or two.

For Norway’s Crown Prince Haakon and his wife Mette-Marit, Christmas is all about enjoying the snow.

By contrast, Monaco’s Prince Albert and Princess Charlene spend the big day making the most of the Mediterranean sunshine, although with the princess still in hospital following the birth of twin babies, this year’s celebrations look set to be a little more muted.

But what about the rest? Nikki Jeffries, royal expert and managing editor at Royalista.com, reveals what the crowned heads of Europe did on December 25th.

‘Finally Christmas is here again and the royals in Europe are celebrating the festive season in many ways.

‘Some, including King Felipe and Queen Letizia, will be "at work", while others are taking well-deserved holidays or spreading Christmas cheer wherever they can.

‘In Denmark 41 royals, among them Queen Margrethe and her heir Crown Prince Frederik, will be gathered around the Christmas tree for what is one of the largest royal family Christmases in Europe.

‘Like the Queen, Margrethe also sends a Christmas message to her people, although Denmark’s speech is made on New Year’s Day instead.

‘In Monaco, this year will be all about the twins, although swimming and giving gifts are likely to play a part in keeping with Monegasque tradition.

‘The Norwegian royals will enjoy the most low-key celebrations, much of which will revolve around gingerbread which is an essential way to spread Christmas cheer.

‘Regardless of which country is involved, the one thing that they all do have in common is that Christmas is private and all about family.’
