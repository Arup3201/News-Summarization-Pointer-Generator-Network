Jailed: Peeping Tom Jonathan Waugh installed an 
alarm clock with a motion sensitive camera in the bedroom of his guest 
house in Whitby, Yorkshire

A holiday seaside cottage owner has been jailed for a year after secretly filming his guests having sex.

Jonathan Waugh, a self-confessed ‘porn addict,’ installed a mini camera into a bedroom alarm clock and watched the footage on a wide screen TV in his own cottage in Whitby, on the North Yorkshire coast.

York Crown Court heard the 52-year-old former broadcast engineer even installed sensitive night-vision cameras to view the night time antics of holidaymakers at Easter Cottage for over a year. 

His ‘disgusting and depraved’ hobby 
was only halted when a guest, who was a former investigator, was taken 
ill to bed and spotted the alarm clock device.

Prosecutor
Richard Gent said Waugh would check that it was couples who would be 
using the main bedroom of the cottage before setting up the device, 
which worked on a motion sensor.

He was found out last year when a couple with two children booked the cottage between November 7 and 11.

It was then the husband, a former investigator, was taken ill and retired to bed.

Mr Gent said that the guest noticed
something unusual about the alarm clock and examined it to find a 
memory card installed inside it.

He
went straight to the police station with the item and when Waugh was 
quizzed he made admissions that he had been 'addicted' to pornography 
since his twenties.

He had paid £600 for the equipment 
which he bought on the internet and had used it to record couples in the
room for 13 months between October 2010 and November 2011.

He
added that he had updated the equipment, which could record in the 
dark, with a larger memory card and watched the resulting visual and 
audio recordings for his own sexual gratification in his own bedroom in 
the cottage opposite.

Voyeurism: Jonathan Waugh, even installed sensitive night-vision cameras to view the night time antics of holidaymakers at Easter Cottage, in Whitby, on the North Yorkshire coast

Caught out: The bedroom where he had set up his hidden camera. Waugh was only halted when a guest, who was a former investigator, was taken ill to bed and spotted the alarm clock camera device

Easter Cottage is a 19th century three-bedroom holiday home close to Whitby marina.

The double bedroom is on the second floor.

Guest comments include: 'Beds are so comfy, the best I've ever slept in when on holiday. The owner has gone that extra mile to ensure this property is a joy to stay in. Well done sir.' July 2011.

'A lovely comfortable cottage, ideally placed to explore Whitby on foot. We were made very welcome by the owners on arrival.' April 2011.

'Met by owner who had left milk, tea bags, washing up liquid etc, and explained how everything worked. Bonus having towels, tea towels as we did not have to bring own.'

'The owner Jon is great he really goes the extra mile to make everything just right.'Sept 2010.

'After speaking to the owner he is in the middle of renovating it so it can only get better.' May 2010.

As a result the guest and his wife were reported to have felt violated and their relationship to have suffered as a result of the 'disgusting and depraved' actions of the holiday cottage owner.

Mitigating Rupert Dodswell said his client was of previous good character and had been very anxious and depressed following the discovery.

He added that as a result his client had had suicidal thoughts, but had also voluntarily been seeking help and treatment for his problems.

He asked the court not to send Waugh into custody so that he could continue to receive help.

After jailing Waugh for 12 months, Recorder David Bradshaw also ordered that he be placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years and subject for the same period to a Sexual Offences Protection Order.

This will restrict Waugh’s further use of covert recording equipment and his ability to own and run a holiday let, unless the police have notification and access to check it out.

Waugh, of Shelley, near Huddersfield, 
West Yorks, pleaded guilty to two charges of voyeurism and asked for a 
further six offences of fitting surveillance equipment and making 
recordings in Easter Cottage to be taken into consideration.
