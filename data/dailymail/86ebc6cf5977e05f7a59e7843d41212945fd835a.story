The makers of Grand Theft Auto have accused Lindsay Lohan of suing them purely to get attention after the actress filed a lawsuit claiming a character in the game was based on her. 

In Manhattan court papers made public yesterday, Take-Two Interactive Software and subsidiary company, Rockstar Games, call the case frivolous and claim it was 'filed for publicity purposes'.

The producers of the hugely-popular game are now demanding the lawsuit be dropped and are asking that the actress be made to pay their legal fees up to now.

Lawsuit: Lindsay Lohan is suing the makers of Grand Theft Auto V for using her likeness in the game

The 28-year-old Mean Girls star sued the company in July claiming that the game used her voice, image and style in their creation of a bikini-clad character named Lacey Jonas.

The company denies this and says the character's only resemblance with Lohan is that they are both young, blonde women.

But Lohan insists the similarities go much further. 

In the game, the actress's lookalike alter-ego parties at infamous celebrity haunt, the Hotel Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, 'a place where the plaintiff once lived and often frequents', according to the case documents.

Lohan's legal papers also claim the 'game features a mission where the plaintiff's look-alike asks another character to take her home and escape the paparazzi'.

The papers conclude that the Lacey Jonas character sports the same 'likeness, clothing, outfits, clothing line products, ensemble in the form of hats, hair style, sunglasses and jean shorts worn by [Lohan]...before the release of the GTA V video game'. 

Lohan's lawyers are yet to comment. 

In her papers Lohan specifically refers to the The Hotel Chateau Marmont - where a scene in GTA V plays out.

A letter written to Lohan from the high-end hotel, located on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, recently surfaced which shows that the star owed them a staggering $46,350 in July 2012.
