The FBI and Justice Department
prosecutors have recommended bringing criminal charges against
former CIA chief David Petraeus.

He has been accused of improperly providing
classified information to a female Army Reserve officer with
whom he was having an affair, the New York Times reported on
Friday.

The Justice Department investigation focuses on whether Petraeus gave his biographer Paula Broadwell, access to his CIA email account and other highly classified information.

Investigation: The FBI and Justice Department prosecutors have recommended bringing criminal charges against former CIA chief David Petraeus

The
Times said officials have recommended felony charges. 

Mr. Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the C.I.A. in 2012 when the affair became public. 

He has consistently denied giving Ms. Broadwell any access to classified material and, according to the paper, has told the judge he will not accept a plea deal. 

Petraeus was credited with helping pull Iraq from the brink of an all-out civil war as commander there and President Barack Obama turned to him to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan before moving to him to the CIA in 2011.

In May 2013, Paula Broadwell finally issued an apology for the first time since her affair with former CIA director David Petraeus was exposed.

'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station WSOC in Charlotte.

'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will.

'Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.'

Broadwell met Petraeus, 60, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University and working on a dissertation about him.

She then wrote his biography called All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, for which she was able to spend large portions of time with him. 

In a statement in the aftermath of the scandal, Petraeus said: ‘I am very pleased to join such a great team. I have watched KKR evolve as it adapted to the post-financial crisis world and became a go-to partner for companies worldwide.

'I look forward to supporting the investment teams in their pursuit of the best opportunities for clients and also being a part of a new initiative to provide additional insights to KKR's clients and companies.’
