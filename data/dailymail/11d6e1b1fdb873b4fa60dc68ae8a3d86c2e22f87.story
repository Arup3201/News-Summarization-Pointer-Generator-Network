Russia's Foreign Minister has warned his American counterpart that fresh sanctions against Moscow could damage relations between the two countries 'for a long time'.

Sergei Lavrov made the comments to John Kerry during a phone call amid growing concerns for Russia's crisis-hit economy.

It came as a spokesman revealed Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un to Moscow for the 70th anniversary of the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two.

Russia's economy is suffering as a result of both Western sanctions imposed as punishment for the annexation of Crimea and falling global oil prices.

The rouble lost almost half its value last week and the stock market hit a five-year low. 

Russians, worried about the collapse in the rouble, are rushing to buy durable goods such as cars and electronics before prices rise and their savings devalue as the rouble tumbles.

The Swedish firm has now been forced to temporarily stop sales of kitchen furniture and appliances in Russia because it could not meet increased demand.

 'Ikea Russia is temporarily stopping sales of kitchen furniture and appliances due to a large number of customer orders.'  

The Russian central bank has been frantically selling off foreign currency in a bid to to try prop up the rouble.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Moscow next year to mark the 70th anniversary of the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two, the Kremlin's spokesman said on Friday.

It would be Kim's first foreign visit since taking the helm of the reclusive east Asian state in 2011. His personal envoy came to Moscow last month in the framework of efforts by the two Cold War-era allies to improve relations.

Russia marks the former Soviet Union's World War Two victory every year on May 9.

Moscow needs North Korean cooperation in boosting natural gas exports to South Korea as Gazprom wants to build a gas pipeline through North Korea to reach its southern neighbour.

Pyongyang is also seeking support from Russia, a permanent veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council, against international criticism over accusations of human rights abuses and its nuclear programme.

The U.N. General Assembly committee dealing with human rights passed a resolution last month calling for the Security Council to consider referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has also said North Korea is ready to resume stalled international talks on its nuclear programme. 

A new US law means President Barack Obama has the power to impose further sanctions if he so chooses which analysts say would be aimed mainly at Russia's defence industries.

The new legislation also gives the president the power to provide both lethal and non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine.

Yesterday the EU issued new sanctions banning investment in Crimea and said cruise ships will not stop at its ports.

Under the new restrictions, European Union companies will not be allowed to buy real estate in Crimea, finance local companies or supply related services.

Tourism services are also banned, with cruise ships barred from Crimea ports, except in an emergency.

Russia annexed Crimea earlier this year after holding a referendum which was widely seen as corrupt after weeks of unrest. 

European Council president Donald Tusk said: 'We should send a strong signal on our readiness to further support Ukraine, also financially, as we have done politically today by making the existing sanctions on Crimea and Sebastopol more effective.'

Yesterday in a show of defiance Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the economic problems on external factors and said the crisis over Ukraine was caused by the West, which he accused of building a 'virtual' Berlin Wall to contain Russia.

The former KGB spy said Russia must diversify its economy to reduce dependence on oil, its major export and a key source of state income, but he gave no details and has said many times during 15 years in power that he will do this.

And he showed no sign of heeding a call by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini for 'a radical change in attitude towards the rest of the world and to switch to a cooperative mode'. 

Putin's popularity has soared over the annexation of Crimea but the rouble's decline could erode faith in his ability to provide financial stability, an important source of his support.

An opponent, former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, said problems would mount as prices are expected to surge next year and Putin would need 'an exit strategy' to leave power.

But Putin said he felt the 'support of the Russian people', though he had not decided yet whether to seek a new six-year term in an election due in 2018.

Asked about Ukraine, where Russia has irked the West by backing pro-Russian separatists fighting in two eastern regions, Putin said Moscow wanted a political resolution to a conflict that has killed 4,700 people.

He also called for 'political unity', suggesting he does not intend to annexe the regions that have rebelled, and avoided calling them 'New Russia', a phrase he has used in the past.

But he blamed NATO for the worst relations between Moscow and the West in decades.

'Didn't they tell us after the collapse of the Berlin Wall that NATO would not expand eastwards? But it happened immediately. Two waves of expansion. Is that not a wall? ... It's a virtual wall,' he said. (Additional reporting by Moscow newsroom; Editing by Giles Elgood)
