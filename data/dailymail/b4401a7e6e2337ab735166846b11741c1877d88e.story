From lighting a real candle on the branch of an indoor Christmas tree, to a well-dressed family singing carols on a stairwell in the home, it seems Christmas has changed significantly over the years.

This romantic collection of nostalgic black and white photos reveal there wasn't a beard bauble in sight as people from a bygone era celebrated the festive season.

As well as images of shoppers on a not-so-crowded street in Holborn, London, the photos capture the Golden Age of Hollywood.

From Bob Hope at the height of his career, to Marilyn Monroe posing seductively by a chimney in her stockings, the images reveal how the stars of Tinseltown celebrated Christmas in style.

Here, Femail picks its favourite images that show an It's A Wonderful Life-style Christmas...
