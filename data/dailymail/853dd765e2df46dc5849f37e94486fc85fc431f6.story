Accusations: Gary Barlow faced a backlash today over allegations he invested in a scheme allegedly designed to avoid paying tax

Gary Barlow faced a backlash last night after it emerged he and two Take That bandmates invested £26million in a scheme allegedly designed to avoid paying tax.

Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen and their manager, Jonathan Wild, face suggestions they avoided paying their fair share of income tax.

They are among 1,000 people who contributed £480million to 62 partnerships in music industry investment schemes that act as tax shelters for super-rich individuals.

The revelations have prompted MPs to question the decision to honour Barlow with an OBE this month.

Revenue officials will attempt to shut down the partnerships, run by a company called Icebreaker Management Services, at a tribunal in November.

A spokesman for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs said: 'We do not accept that the Icebreaker tax schemes have the tax effects their promoters claim.'

He said one Icebreaker scheme had already been successfully challenged.

Labour MP Stephen Pound criticised Barlow yesterday, saying: 'It's less Take That and more like Take That And All The Rest. Gary Barlow needs to do his patriotic duty and show he is not a part-time patriot off-shoring his wealth through this shelter while keeping his OBE on-shore.'

Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said he was 'on the warpath' over people who did not pay full tax.

He said: 'Honours are meant to be for people who serve Britain and are good citizens in doing so. If you don't pay your taxes you're not a fully decent citizen.

'In the future, the honours committee – because these things are all scrutinised – should make sure that people are clean as far as their tax affairs are concerned as well as having done good public service for Britain and its exports.'

Mr Hughes added: 'I think we'll hear a lot more of this in the weeks ahead. I'm certainly one of those on the warpath and I'm not going to be diverted. It is completely unacceptable.

'We've had billions of pounds unpaid every year by people like the comedians and the singers we're talking about – that's got to end.'

Lawyers representing Barlow, Donald, 
Owen and Mr Wild confirmed their clients were investors in two 
Icebreaker partnerships, but believed they were legitimate enterprises.

Icebreaker denies that its partnerships were designed to avoid tax. There is no suggestion that the scheme is illegal.

Lib Dem MP Greg Mulholland, a member of the Public Administration Select committee, said: ‘It is wrong for those held up as models of service and duty to be given or indeed to accept honours despite having deliberately avoided the payment of tax.

Jimmy Carr has broken his silence over claims that he dodged tax, insisting: 'I pay what I have to and not a penny more'

'Those who are happy to be honoured by their country should also be happy to pay taxes to their country. Not doing so is not acceptable and unpatriotic.’

He added that those honoured by the nation ‘should be happy to make their contribution to national life in every sense’.’

Stephen Williams, the Lib Dems’ co-chair of their Treasury policy committee, added: ‘I don’t think our system should honour individuals who don’t pay their way.’

A typical Icebreaker partnership collects around £10million from about a dozen investors and uses the funds to buy music rights in upcoming and established artists.

Investors get tax relief on any money they invest in the scheme.

However, they are able to wipe out more tax than they actually pay because any investment they make out of their own cash can be bumped up by taking a loan arranged by Icebreaker from an offshore bank and also investing this in the scheme.

For example, someone who makes a minimum investment of £40,000 of their own money into an Icebreaker partnership, could boost the amount they put in by taking an offshore loan for £160,000.

They would get tax relief on the full amount they paid in - wiping £77,250 off their bill.

A person who invests £200,000 in cash can earn £1million tax free.

If the tax relief they get is greater than their annual income then it can be used by a wealthy investor against other income they have paid tax on during the previous three years.

Icebreaker denied that its partnerships were designed to avoid tax. It said they were intended to invest money in the music industry for profit by producing ‘creative and artistic material and [creating] taxable profits’

Companies House records show that the three Take That members and their manager joined two Icebreaker partnerships in March 2010 and September 2011.

In the first, they put in £5.2million of their own cash and borrowed another £20.8million.

The partnership registered a loss in the year to April 2010 of £25.2million, which accounts show as ‘available for discretionary division among members’.

Lawyers representing Barlow, Donald, Owen and Mr Wild said the men had paid significant amounts of tax.

They confirmed that their clients were investors in the two partnerships, but believed they were legitimate enterprises and not tax-avoidance schemes.

There is no suggestion that other members of Take That were investors - and it is not known whether those that did were aware of the tax benefits when they invested in the partnerships.

There is no suggestion that the scheme is illegal.

A typical Icebreaker partnership 
collects around £10million from about a dozen investors and uses the

Icebreaker
can help investors to save more in tax than they put into the scheme 
with losses being offset by a wealthy investor against other income 
earned during the previous three years.

Investors can bump up this tax relief by taking out offshore loans arranged by Icebreaker.

For
a minimum investment of £40,000 into an Icebreaker partnership, boosted
by an offshore loan of £160,000, a member can generate £77,520 of tax 
relief.

A person who invests £200,000 in cash can earn £1million tax free.
