I’ve just got back from a training camp in Rio and it was such an amazing trip. I’d never been and had seen a lot of films about Brazil and Rio. Despite all of the things you hear about the favelas and the dangerous side of things, it had such a good vibe.

Everyone there seems to be health and fitness crazy. At every bus stop or by the beach, almost at every point you could see, there was an outside gym or a frame to work out on. So there were people all over the place getting jacked up or doing chin ups and it was really cool. I’ve never seen anything like it.

It was a perfectly balanced trip for us, which was really good. We’re just going into that competition phase and normally we train at home but to go out there really helped mix it up. It keeps you fresh and it’s good to be with the team as we enjoy spending time with each other.

Without National Lottery funding, we wouldn’t be able to go out and do trips like this. Of course we get the chance to enjoy ourselves and get refreshed, but it’s also such a great opportunity to do some really good work before all the exciting things ahead.

We got a lot of serious training done and when Alexei Evangulov, our performance director, decided to go to Rio, it was partly because they have one of the best gym facilities in the world. To have that was a really big part of going there.

But we were also based just over the road from the beach so it only took us about 10 seconds to get there – Alexei definitely got that one right!

It was great to do the tourist thing but in a way it gets that excitement out of the way for the next time we go. Hopefully then we will all be in serious competition mode.

Health-wise it also helps us boost our vitamin D with all the sunshine. That gets low in the winter so there’s no better way to top that up than spend some time in Rio!

Unfortunately we couldn’t eat street food because, with strict drug testing, we have to know what goes in our bodies, but the food at the hotel was incredible. 

There was so much rich, vibrant fruit, which was great, but going out to eat was tough. None of us speak Portuguese and there wasn’t much English spoken, so when Jack Laugher and I were free, we tried to book a table but the people at the restaurant had no idea what we were on about!

It was great to enjoy moments like that and I think we are the closest knit team in Team GB. A lot of training programmes train together 24/7 but we’re scattered all over the country. There’s a bunch of us in Leeds, Plymouth and London so when we come together it’s such a good laugh.

Going to see Christ the Redeemer was phenomenal. It’s hard to explain how good it was. It wasn’t just the statue, it was that stunning view for miles around. Luckily you can get a coach up to the top – we didn’t have to run up there for extra training! It was great to go to the beach too and the waves were huge, so that was a lot of fun.

With team-mate Jack Laugher, Mears says their lack of Portuguese made it tricky to dine out in Rio

It’s also a very exciting time for me right now because my first single is finally coming out. I’ve got a music deal with Universal and I’ve been working so hard to reach this stage and now for it to be released is crazy.

I’m moving in with Jack in March and will hopefully get to set up a bit of a studio to work in between training. As divers we have quite a big fan base in Mexico for some reason so I recently went there to do a bit of a tour and do some DJ sets. So the first single is actually called ‘Mexico’ and is dropping there first!

So it’s been a busy few weeks but all exciting stuff. The trip to Rio was a small but significant step towards reaching our Olympic dreams and it really whet our appetite. To stand there on the boards and see the Olympic rings already up in the stadium, we were all thinking: ‘Yep, this is going to be good.’

As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week National Lottery players raise over £33 million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities. Find out where your money goes at lotterygoodcauses.org.uk
