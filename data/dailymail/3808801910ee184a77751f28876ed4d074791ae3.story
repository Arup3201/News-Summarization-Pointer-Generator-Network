A student who fractured her spine leaping into an African waterfall has taught herself to walk again. 

Deven McAlister was on a gap year adventure when she  dived into the water striking the rocky bottom of the plunge pool.

The impact crushed her spine, breaking it in two places and left her needing emergency surgery. 

The brave 19-year-old endured intensive physiotherapy and strength training to get back on her feet.

Brave teen: Deven McAlister,19, has battled to walk again after she fractured her spine diving into a plunge pool during a gap year adventure in South Africa

'I was in and out of consciousness,' said the teen, recalling the accident in January this year.

'I've been told by my friends that I was in a lot of pain. I remember being in an ambulance and then the hospital, but it's all a blur.'

Miss McAlister was  traveling through Mpumalanga, in the east of South Africa, as part of her year out before starting university, when the accident happened.

During a visit to a waterfall with her travel companions in January this year the teen  dived from a ledge into the pool below.

She was carried back to the top of the cliff by her new friends and taken by ambulance to a local A&E. 

She was 10 days into the 10 week adventure. 

Doctor's in the remote safari resort initially believed she had only suffered muscle damage and despite her excruciating pain she was encouraged to stand and walk.

The following day she was transferred to a private hospital for more scans and they discovered Miss McAlister had suffered a compressed fracture and dislocated the T12-L1 part of her spine.

The keen hockey player endured a week in intensive care before she finally had surgery on her back.

Surgeons placed six pins in her back as part of a spinal fusion to repair the damage.

 'This was very hard to deal with as I was in a foreign country without my family,' said Miss McAlister.

'Before my operation I was on a lot of drugs and I can barely remember anything other than my friends visiting me in hospital.

'My mum and dad had to fly out to South Africa. I remember bits of them being there. It was tough.'

After the surgery the young woman from Bowness, in Windermere, Cumbria, faced the daunting prospect of learning to walk again.

'I had been lying down for weeks so when I sat up I felt really ill. I felt like I was walking on water.

'Every day it was about doing a few more steps and eventually going up the stairs.'

She was discharged from the African hospital after just a week of demanding physiotherapy.

Her proudest moment came when she was able to push her own wheelchair out of hospital. 

'It's a memory that will stay with her forever,' said Miss McAlister.

'I had missed two and a half weeks of my volunteer program already and I was desperate to complete it to the best of my ability,' she said.

'It took a lot of time and effort, doing daily exercises which before the accident were so simple and after so exhausting.'

Miss McAlister had to miss some of the activities, but she managed to complete the 10 week placement.  

When she returned home she her to put her university plans on hold, and has spent the past 11 months regaining as much fitness, strength and flexibility as possible. 

'Since the accident I have reconsidered what I want to do,' she said.

'It's completely changed my life. I've always done a lot of charity work but it's completely opened my eyes. I want to do more.' 

Learning to walk again was like 'walking on water,' said the pretty teenager, who had intensive physiotherapy

'The hardest bit is I've spent a lot of time getting my fitness back.

'A lot of people think 'how can you move on from an injury like that?' But I get on with it and turn it around.

'I know I am very lucky,' she said. 'I have had to build all my muscles up again but I am as strong as I have ever been.' 

Deven McAlister is planning to take part in a grueling London to Paris cycling challenge to raise money for spinal injury research

Miss McAlister is now planning to push her recovering body to the limit by completing a grueling 300 mile London to Paris bike ride to raise money for Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation. 

She will be joined by her cousin, Becky Anderson, in April for the mammoth cycle and the pair are hoping to raise £3,000. 

'The work the charity do is amazing,' Miss McAlister said.

'Without the knowledge gained and shared through research I would not have recovered as well as I have.

'At the moment they are supporting scientists to find a cure for paralysis - to think that there could be a cure for that is just crazy.

'The charity was set up after a man around my age broke his neck while also on a gap year. It is so close to home.'
