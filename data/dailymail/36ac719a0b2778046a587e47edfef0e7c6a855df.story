A vegan mom whose newborn son was taken into care for five months after she refused to take him to hospital for weight treatment has revealed the moment he was taken away by cops. 

Sarah Markham, from Florida, was finally allowed to care for her son Caleb last week following a judge's orders, although she still faces child neglect charges.

Caleb was taken into care in June when, instead of following a doctor's orders to take him to an emergency room, Markham decided to try supplementing her breast milk with a vegan formula.

Charges? The new mother was finally reunited with her son Caleb last week, although she still has an arraignment scheduled for this week

'Caleb was losing some weight so I had some concerns that I was only breastfeeding and that is when they said we needed to supplement,' she told Today.

'Instead of taking him to the hospital I went and got the formula,' she said. 

Markham's doctor then reported the new mother to Child Protective Services - she was arrested for child neglect and 12-day-old Caleb was away and given to her parents.

Police had to call a locksmith to get into her home. 

Victory: Markham regained custody of her child last week after he was taken away because she wanted to supplement her breast milk with a soy formula

Healthy: 'He's still on a soy formula – he's been on it, he likes it, he's doing well. He's growing healthy, and I can't ask for anything more,' Markham said outside the courtroom

Defensive: Caleb's grandfather, who has been caring for the boy, has said there is absolutely no child abuse in this case and that his daughter is a fit mother

An arrest report says Markham was 'argumentative' and 'defensive at times' and did not have a 'sense of urgency'.

Markham's lawyer Mark O'Mara does admit that the infant 'was, in fact, having trouble gaining weight,' but writes, 'Sarah believes the doctor would NOT have recommended she go to the hospital if she hadn't challenged him by asking for an alternative.' 

After her arrest, he adds, the newborn was taken to the hospital and fed the vegan formula by those caring for him, 'and that's all they did for the baby.'

But Markham insists she was acting with her son's best interests at heart.

'As a new mom you have this wonderful joy when you are pregnant, you want to meet the the little person inside for the first time and you want them to see you as the protector, you are mommy,' she said.

Last week the judge decided that Markham was not an unfit mother and said she could have him back if she promises to meet with a nutritionist.

Markham, who has a degree in health science, agreed to visit a nutritionist but said her son, who had lost 10 per cent of his body weight, is still on a soy formula.

'He's still on a soy formula – he's been on it, he likes it, he's doing well. He's growing healthy, and I can't ask for anything more,' Markham said.

'There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect, there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother and he didn't like it,' grandfather Bo Markham told WFTV.

Caleb now weighs 17 pounds and has been taken care of by his grandparents who believe their daughter is a fit mother.

Last Wednesday's case was for the sole purpose of regaining custody but Markham  still faces criminal charges that her lawyer is confident a judge will dismiss as well.

'My hope is that they'll simply dismiss it and not go forward on this at all,' Mark O'Mara said.  

Markham is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist and holistic healing and a vegan diet is in her system of beliefs.

Because of her choice not to take her son to the hospital, Markham  was only allowed to see her son during supervised visits and only a few times a week, according to Seminole County Child Protective Services.

'They've kept a child away from a mom,' said attorney Mark O'Mara to WFTV.

'My client can only see her child once a week or twice a week because they're requiring the child be out of the county,' he said prior to Markham regaining custody.

O'Mara said that Markham's parenting was 'not even close' to child neglect.

Healthy: Markham's now healthy baby had lost 10 per cent of his body weight and doctors told her to take the baby to the hospital but she tried giving him a vegan baby formula instead

'It's absurd. It's a mom trying to do the best she can, acting as a vegan which she has the entire right to do taking care of her child,' he said.

Markham's son is now healthy and she is happy to have him home.

'She has done everything they've asked her to do: Mental health evaluations, drug evaluations, parenting classes, everything they've asked her to do she's done, and she's done it very well, and yet we have to go to trial on this tomorrow. It's absurd,' said O'Mara before winning the custody battle.
