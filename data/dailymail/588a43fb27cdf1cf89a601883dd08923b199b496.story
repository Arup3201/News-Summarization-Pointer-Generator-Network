A pair of beer-toting tourists have been arrested after they allegedly stole a Disney World golf cart and went on a dangerous joy ride ride that took them right past a patrolling sheriff's deputy.

Michael Kulesza, 38, and Donald Michael Rossi Jr., 33, were charged with grand theft after the Sunday morning stunt, which had pedestrians jumping out of the way.

'They were yelling, shouting, and laughing as they drove past where we were standing. They were obviously not Disney Cast Members,' the deputy wrote in an incident report.

The deputy was patrolling at Disney's Boardwalk entertainment area near Epcot when he spotted the golf cart driving 'in a reckless manner' towards the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

'They rounded the corner fast enough to cause the extended golf cart to almost tip over,' the police report read.

The deputy gave chase and caught the intoxicated men at the back entrance to the Swan Resort.

There he asked them to get out of the cart and they apologized for making a ruckus.

'The driver, holding one beer, was identified as defendant Donald Michael Rossi Jr.,' he wrote in the report. 'The passenger, holding two beers, was identified as defendant Michael Kulesza.'

An employee at a nearby restaurant told police he saw the two men make off with the $6,000 golf cart after he parked it to dispose of trash from the eatery.

According to the Sentinel, the pair continued to apologize en route to jail where they were booked and later released on $5,000 bail.

Disney's Boardwalk is a quarter-mile promenade of dining, shops and nightlife near to the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resorts.
