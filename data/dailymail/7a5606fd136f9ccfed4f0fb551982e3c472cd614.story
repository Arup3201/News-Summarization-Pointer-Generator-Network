 

Jose Mourinho might not appreciate the comparison but right now his Chelsea team more closely resemble Newcastle United in their heady days under Kevin Keegan than anything he has assembled before.

Chelsea so far are the great entertainers and have scored and conceded more goals after five matches than any previous Mourinho team.

Wednesday night’s 1-1 draw against Schalke in the Champions League means Chelsea have found the net 16 times but had their own defence breached on seven occasions.

For a man so focused on tactical tightness that total is anathema to Mourinho, even if his side remain unbeaten.

Only in his 2011-12 season at Real Madrid has Mourinho started a season anywhere like this one at Stamford Bridge.

Back then after five games in all competitions Real had scored 15 goals and conceded six. Ominous signals for the Premier League chasing pack; Real won La Liga that season, scoring a frankly ridiculous 121 times for a plus 89 goal difference to accrue 100 points.

It was the season Lionel Messi bagged 50 league goals and Cristiano Roanldo 46. Radamel Falcao’s 24-goal offering for Atletico Madrid pales in comparison.

Diego Costa has begun this campaign on such form, with seven goals in four starts before failing to find the winner against Schalke coming off the bench with 16 minutes remaining.

His hamstrings prohibit excessive action each week and Mourinho must manage his £32million striker to ensure that if Chelsea fail to secure their backline, the Spain international can provide enough firepower to make amends.

With Cesc Fabregas conducting from deep and Eden Hazard a devious presence further up, Chelsea will always carry a potent goal threat.

But those seven concessions will irritate Mourinho, who has opened this season with a settled back four in front of one of the world’s best goalkeepers.

John Terry, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Cesar Azpilicueta, and Thibaut Courtois have started every Premier League game, with Filipe Luis slotting in at left back for Wednesday night’s game.

That is a defence which should provide a solid base, but Everton penetrated it three times, Swansea twice and Burnley once.

Their only clean sheet thus far has come at home to Leicester, who would have scored had David Nugent been cooler (or Courtois more panicked) when clean through.

Nemanja Matic is the midfielder tasked with greatest defensive duty but he can bomb forward and leave spaces for counter-attacks to blossom. 

With Manchester City at the Etihad next up for Mourinho – the scene of a sophisticated 1-0 victory last term – it may be he returns to his favoured trivote formation of three deep midfielders, with John Obi Mikel recruited for added security.

Mourinho’s first season at Chelsea saw six goals scored and just one conceded in the opening five games. They went on to win the title comfortably and efficiently.

There is nothing efficient about scoring six to counteract three conceded, or four to beat two, and as the season progresses expect the Portuguese to tailor his team accordingly. 

Roman Abramovich has always wanted an exciting Chelsea team and it seems he is getting his wish
