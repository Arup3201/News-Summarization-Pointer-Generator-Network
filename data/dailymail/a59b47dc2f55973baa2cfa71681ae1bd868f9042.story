A leader of the St Paul’s Cathedral camp almost refused to fight eviction attempts because she despaired at fellow protesters getting drunk and abusing each other, a court heard yesterday.

Tammy Samede voiced her concerns at a meeting of demonstrators days before she was due to appear in the High Court as a defendant in the City of London’s action to try to clear the tent city outside the cathedral.

There have been more than 70 arrests at the anti-capitalist camp in just two months after a spate of alcohol-fuelled fights between demonstrators that has left many women activists scared to stay on the site.

Split? A leader of the St Paul's Cathedral camp almost refused to fight attempts to evict it because she despaired at fellow protesters 'getting p**** and abusing each other'

St Paul’s has also been ‘desecrated’ 
by protesters daubing sacrilegious graffiti on the cathedral and 
urinating and defecating on sacred ground, the court has heard.

Miss Samede, an unemployed mother of 
four, told fellow protesters on December 13 that violence bred fear and 
‘a society where women are scared to go to toilet during the night’.

She added: ‘I’m supposed to be in court on Monday. I’m afraid that’s not going to happen.

‘I’m not sure what it is that I’m going to be spending three days defending.

‘Do you want me to defend the right 
to get p****d and abuse each other; not to be reported to the police 
when, if they committed these acts on the street, they would be 
arrested?

‘Sort your s*** out, people.’

Graffiti: '666', 'ACDC' and a heart were some of the symbols spray-painted onto the walls near the front entrance to the cathedral

The minutes from the meeting were read to the court yesterday after Miss Samede, 33, finally agreed to go ahead with the case.

Under cross-examination, she accepted
there were ‘serious issues’ at the camp, but insisted these were 
largely caused by people who ‘didn’t really belong to the movement’.

Another protester, Michael Hayton, 
told the court police should have taken tougher action to protect 
anti-capitalists from abusive City workers and violence from alcoholics 
and people with mental health problems who had moved into the camp.

Fellow defendant George Barda suggested some of the problems helped cathedral officials ‘learn a lesson’.

Referring to defecation inside the 
church, the former Winchester College pupil and Oxford University law 
student said they were experiencing ‘the kinds of harms they usually 
externalise’, adding: ‘There is an element of poetic justice.’

The hearing continues.
