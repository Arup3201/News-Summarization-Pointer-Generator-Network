The wife of one of Britain’s richest men may have been dead for up to a week in a bedroom at the couple's mansion, it emerged today.

A post mortem carried out on Eva Rausing, 48, was inconclusive and further tests are being carried out to establish cause of death – and when she died.

Mrs Rausing's body was found in a bedroom at their £70million London home. Hours after Hans Kristian Rausing was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs.

The 49-year-old father of four, an heir to the £4.5billion Tetra Pak drinks carton fortune, was being questioned in connection with what Scotland Yard called an ‘unexplained death’.

Last night police said Hans Rausing remained under arrest but had been taken to hospital for medical treatment.

Officials refused to discuss why but 
the news prompted speculation that he had suffered some kind of 
breakdown.

It is understood he will be in hospital for 'a matter of days' with an unspecified illness. His bail is suspended while he is not in police custody and will restart once he is detained again.

Earlier, security staff were called in to help download CCTV 
cameras from the Chelsea mansion and surrounding area. 

A post mortem examination was carried 
out yesterday afternoon on 48-year-old Mrs Rausing, but failed to find 
the cause of death.

Hans Rausing was arrested on suspicion of driving erratically in South London at lunchtime on Monday and was found to be carrying Class A drugs

Further toxicology tests will take place to 
determine whether drugs or alcohol were responsible.

Her husband of almost 20 years was 
arrested on suspicion of driving erratically in South London at 
lunchtime on Monday and was found to be carrying Class A drugs.

Officers
searched his home to see if more illicit substances were there, and 
found his wife’s body.

Specialist police teams carried out tests throughout yesterday at the six-storey house in Cadogan Place.

Details of their son’s arrest and 
daughter-in-law’s death were broken to 86-year-old Hans Rausing and his 
wife Marit at their 900-acre East Sussex estate. They issued a statement
saying they were ‘deeply shocked and saddened’.

Devastated: The family of Eva Rausing said she bravely fought her health issues for many years but helped others with her charity work

Eva Rausing’s father Tom Kemeny is a 
former Pepsi executive who owns an island off South Carolina and a 
property in Barbados with his wife Nancy. The couple also have a 
£10million property near their late daughter’s home in Cadogan Place.

They said of their daughter: ‘During 
her short lifetime she made a huge philanthropic impact, supporting a 
large number of charitable causes, not only financially, but using her 
own personal experiences. She bravely fought her health issues for many 
years. The family is devastated at her death.’

Eva Rausing was a co-patron with the 
Duchess of Cambridge of the drug charity Action on Addiction. Officials 
said they were ‘devastated’ by the tragedy.

Within hours of the discovery of the 
body, police seized security CCTV footage from inside and outside the 
property focusing on Cadogan Place and a mews at the rear.

Ravaged by their drug problems: Eva and Hans Rausing met at an addiction clinic in the U.S. 25 years ago

Discovery: Police found Mrs Rausing's body in an upstairs bedroom at the five-storey Georgian townhouse

Yesterday 
morning a detective showed a security expert out through a back door of 
the house and walked up and down the mews lane, working out which CCTV 
cameras had a view of the Rausings’ back door. An hour later, the 
security technician removed a CCTV hard disk drive from inside the 
house.

whose father Michael was Attorney General and then Lord Chancellor 
before becoming Baron Havers. His brother is the actor Nigel Havers.

In recent weeks, Mr and Mrs Rausing 
had seen out walking in the area. He often wore a baseball cap while 
clutching a pack of rolling tobacco. His wife wore cut-off trousers and 
open-toed sandals.

In addition to their London property, 
the couple had an 11-bedroom beachside mansion in Barbados and an 
apartment on The World, a cruise ship for passengers who need to be off 
shore for tax-avoidance purposes.
