A recently released convict accused of stabbing two children in an elevator has been threatening police officers and hospital staff on a psychiatric ward, it has been claimed.

Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was charged on Thursday with the murder of Brooklyn six-year-old Prince Joshua Avitto. He also allegedly stabbed P.J.'s friend Mikayla Capers, 7, in the attack last Sunday.

Hundreds of people gathered at the St. Paul Community Baptist Church in the East New York neighbourhood, for P.J.'s funeral on Friday.

'It's very hard for me to say how very
 sad I am today,' said his father, Nicholas Avitto. 'Our greatest joy 
and pleasure was my son.'

The
 church erupted in applause after the Rev. David Brawley disclosed that 
Mikayla had been taken out of the intensive care unit.

According to the New York Post, St Hubert has been threatening staff at Bellevue hospital where he was taken for evaluation after being accused of the attack..

A source told the paper: 'He is extremely hostile and accepts no responsibility for anything.'

A police source has also told the Post that St. Hubert had been threatening to beat up police officers.

Police
 have said St. Hubert is also a suspect in the Wednesday stabbing of a 
homeless man on a Manhattan subway platform and the fatal stabbing of 
18-year-old Tanaya Copeland a week ago, just blocks from the Brooklyn 
elevator attack. He is not charged in those crimes.

Accused stabber Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was taken to Bellevue hospital for psychiatric treatment

Investigators are now reviewing all stabbings citywide that have occurred since St. Hubert was freed on May 23.

St.
 Hubert, 27, served time for attempted murder and assault. Court records
 show he was arrested in May 2009 after punching his mother in the face,
 choking her with an electrical cord and stealing her car. He pleaded 
guilty in July 2012.

St. 
Hubert was ordered held without bail at his first court appearance late 
Thursday night in Brooklyn Criminal Court. He was brought back to court 
on Friday so a judge could appoint a defense lawyer.

Prince Joshua Avitto, 6, was memorialized on Friday at a funeral with over 1,000 attendees

The
 attorney, Edward Friedman, told reporters afterward that he had only 
spoken to St. Hubert briefly and declined to comment on his client's 
mental condition or any other aspect of the case.

In
 a statement, District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said prosecutors were 
committed to seeking justice for the families of the children.

If convicted, St. Hubert faces a maximum 50 years to life in prison. His next court date is June 11.

The New York Daily News has reported 
that St. Hubert was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia while serving jail time for the attack on his mother.

He was reportedly released from jail without medicine or a referral for psychiatric treatment.

St. 
Hubert's sister Judith Perry has said her brother is eager to clear his 
name and truly believes that he didn't commit the crime.

'I didn’t do it,' he told his sister.

Perry, who
 believes that the police are treating her brother as though he were 
guilty before his trial, said that he told her he was 'abused' by the guards 
who were transporting him to the hospital.

St.Hubert 
said that the guards who took him to the hospital banged his head 
against the wall and tightened his handcuffs until they were painful.

'His
 hand is swollen,' Perry said. 'He doesn’t like the situation he’s in. 
He feels it’s unfair that they are ... judging him guilty without even 
giving him a fair trial.'

Sharod
 Jean-Pierre, P.J.'s 21-year-old sister said that taking the suspect to 
Bellevue did not bring her brother back or do 
anything to quell her pain.

'He’s
 still gonna be able to eat, sleep, talk to people. My little brother 
isn’t going to be able to do that anymore,' Jean-Pierre, 21, said of the
 suspected Brooklyn stabber.
