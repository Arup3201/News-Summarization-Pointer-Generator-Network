Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, faces demands to hand back up to £6 million in bonuses earned at the height of the rate rigging scandal.

The state backed bank is preparing to appeal to Goodwin and former RBS investment bank chief Johnny Cameron to voluntarily give up their awards after deciding that the chances of successful legal action would be slim.

But these efforts to ‘appeal to their better nature’ were described last night as ‘laughable’ by critics.

The news came as chief executive Stephen Hester also faced growing pressure to forfeit a £2 million bonus awarded in 2010.

RBS, fined £390 million for criminally rigging crucial interest rates on Wednesday, has already pledged to use special ‘claw back’ powers to recoup £300 million from staff.  

But the bank believes its only option is to ask Goodwin and Cameron to voluntarily hand back some of the lavish rewards paid during their disastrous reign.

Banks only have the power to dock ‘deferred’ bonuses – issued in company shares - that have not yet paid out.  RBS also introduced the policy in 2009, after it received a £45 billion bail out from taxpayers, meaning it cannot automatically recoup bonuses paid before then.

This means those at the helm of RBS when the worst of the rate–rigging was going on are currently untouchable unless criminal statutes are enforced.

One option is mounting a legal battle to retrieve some of Goodwin’s bonuses if the disgraced former boss refuses to co-operate.

Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood last year over his role in the bank’s collapse.

But insiders believe it would be too costly and the chances of success would be slim.

Chairman
Sir Philip Hampton said on Wednesday that the option of asking ex 
directors to voluntarily hand back their bonuses is ‘being addressed’.

Under pressure: Chief executive Stephen Hester is facing growing pressure to forfeit a £2 million bonus awarded in 2010

But this was slammed by critics.

Deborah Hargreaves, chair of the High Pay Centre said: ‘They had to force Goodwin to give back some of his pension - it’s highly unlikely that he will just hand back his bonus.’

She added:  ‘Morally you’d think Goodwin and Cameron would feel some obligation to make amends for what happened under their make money at all costs culture.

But Philip Hampton is assuming that bankers still have some moral standards when they are quite happy to just take the money and run.’

Fred Goodwin ran RBS from 2000 until it collapsed in October 2008, and was rescued with a £45 billion bail-out from taxpayers. 

The rigging of Libor interest rates  started under his watch in January 2006 and went on until November 2010.

Goodwin, received a £2.8 million bonus in 2006 and a £2.9 million pay out the following year when the worst of the wrong-doing occurred.

He enjoys a £342,500 pension paid for by the taxpayer. He had been in line for a £550,000 annual pension, having cashed in a £2.7 million tax free lump sum, but was forced into giving up more than £200,000 a year after months of political pressure.

Other executives who could receive a call from RBS include Johnny Cameron, the former head of the investment bank.

Cameron, who has received a lifetime ban from the City for his part in the bank’s collapse, received over £4 million in bonuses, split between 2006 and 2007.

This week Hampton warned of the ‘dangerous’ consequences if rogue traders are not locked up. He pledged to help authorities investigating 21 RBS workers involved in manipulating interest rates. 

This includes six individuals still working at the bank.

He said: ‘If people don’t end up in prison over this scandal I worry it will further perpetuate the sense that there is one rule for the financial system and another set of rules.’

Incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney also described Libor rigging as ‘reprehensible’ and said it ‘should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law in the various jurisdictions that are affected.’

Chief executive Stephen Hester also came under fire last night for refusing to hand back a £2 million shares bonus awarded in 2010 while his traders cointinued to rig interest rates. Half of this bonus is due to pay out this year.

Liberal democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘The  board looks more laughable by the day. Asking Fred Goodwin for a generous  gesture  now is like whistling in a hurricane. But the real test for the RBS board is to see how long it takes them to realise Hester cannot possibly ckling on to his £2m bonus awarded in 2010 when the bank was still rigging rates.’

The row comes amid reports that scandal hit Barclays is set to dish out between £1.5 billion and £2 billion in bonuses to staff for their work last year, despite being emboiled in a string of scandals. 

This would mark a drop from the £2.2 billion awarded for 2011, £1.5 billion of which was paid to its investment bankers.

But it comes after arguably its most shameful year in its 323 year history.

In the summer it was slapped with a £290 million fine for rigging crucial interest rates. It set aside another £1.6 billion to pay compensation to customers mis-sold payment protection insurance.  And it has built up an £850 million pot to compensate small businesses sold interest rate swaps alongside loans.

These complex financial instruments were meant to protect firms, from care homes to hair salons, from rising interest rates. Instead they often left businesses with crippling bills when rates fell to record lows.

Chief executive Antony Jenkins has attempted to douse public anger by banning upfront cash bonuses for more than a thousand top investment bankers.
