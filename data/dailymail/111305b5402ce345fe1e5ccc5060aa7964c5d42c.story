No one can deny that the job market is bleak for many.

Thousands of unemployed people spend their days tirelessly filling out application forms, composing cover letters, and trying to think of a creative answer to 'what would you say your weaknesses are in the workplace?'

And after unsuccessfully applying for countless positions, Adam Pacitti had had enough - and spent his last £500 on a billboard asking employers to give him a job.

Graduate Adam Pacitti also went to drastic measures in a bid to get a job, spending his last £500 on this billboard

The 24-year-old dreamed up the way of promoting himself, and his talents, three months ago, after sending out his CV for at least 250 different positions.

Adam, who lives with his family on the Isle of Wight, said he wanted to add something extra to his application - and as video CVs are now a popular form of a applying for jobs, decided to go a little bigger.

He said: 'I thought traditional 
advertising could work to promote it. It's a very striking image and I 
thought news outlets would be able to cover it easily.'

Now, after creating the website employadam.com, and yesterday posting the billboard and Tweeting the image, the would-be producer has watched his campaign for employment go viral in less than 24 hours.

He said: 'After posting, I had about ten re-Tweets in an hour. 

'Then my phone exploded, and now I've had over 7,000 re-Tweets.

'I'm incredibly humbled that people have seen I've thought outside the box, and then shared this with others.'

After graduating this year with a First Class Honours degree in Media Production from the University of Winchester, the student worked in an arcade, filling the two-pence machines and stacking toys.

He said: 'I was grateful to have a job, but it's not something I'd really like to do.

'I came up with the idea for the video and billboard about three months ago, and managed to save up £500 while working.

'I called in favours from friends and asked studios, and made the video, and decided to post the billboard in London, because that's where most of the jobs are.'

Adam said he was forced to come up with the unusual approach after spending six hours a day filling out application forms.

He
 said: 'It's like a job in itself, it's difficult - you have to tailor 
your CV to each job, you're often asked to do a video project - and I 
only had two interviews after sending off my application.

'It can be disheartening applying for so many job and not getting anywhere.

'I have a good degree and relevant 
work experience, but others have more experience than me, so perhaps I 
don't look like the most attractive candidate.

'I thought this would be a way of showing my personality and my experience.'

Adam,
 who says his strengths are production, advertising, good taste of 
mainstream television and a strong knowledge of social media and 
advertising, says his dream job would be a junior producer.

He said: 'If I could get that job with an independent production company or broadcaster, I'd be over the moon.'

The
 creative student says after the campaign he has had some emails from 
companies, but no concrete of a job offer yet - but is hopeful his 
campaign will persuade someone to give him a chance.
