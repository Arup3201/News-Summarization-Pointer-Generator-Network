Google's chief executive Larry Page has revealed the firm has outgrown its original mission statement and is in 'uncharted territory.'

The search giant claimed to 'organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful' when it first launch in 1998 along with the famous mantra 'Don't be evil'.

Now, Page admits he isn't sure what the firm's goals are.

Google's chief executive Larry Page has revealed the firm has outgrown its original mission statement and is in 'uncharted territory'.

Questioned by The Financial Times, Page said: 'We're in a bit of uncharted territory. We're trying to figure it out. 

'How do we use all these resources … and have a much more positive impact on the world?'

In recent years, the firm has expanded into everything from driverless cars to flying drones and smart contact lenses.

However, it has also faced anti-monopoly probes by the European commission and most recently pressure from Europe over the 'right to be forgotten'.

This ruling forced Google to remove search listings to information deemed to be outdated and not in the public interest which saw Britons request over 60,000 links be deleted by October.

The firm last week revealed a plan to take on cancer with smart nanoparticles.

Nanoparticles could be ingested in a pill to enter the bloodstream.

They would be designed to bind to a particular type of cell – like a cancer tumor cell. 

This would be done by 'painting' them with a substance that could interact with the surface of cells.

They'd then travel together as a unit through the bloodstream.

The core of the nanoparticles would be magnetic, so a wearable device that creates a magnetic field could draw the particles – with their target cells in tow – toward it, where they could be detected and counted. 

Experts at Google are studying various non-invasive techniques, like light and radio waves, for detecting and counting the particles.

He says the firm's secretive [x] lab has meant is can do work nobody else can.

It has already developed a smart contact lens. 

It works using tiny sensors and microchips fitted into contact lenses that can then measure and read the amount of glucose in tears, before sending the information to a mobile device so diabetics can manage their condition. 

 'We do benefit from the fact that once we say we're going to do it, people believe we can do it, because we have the resources,' said Page. 

'Google helps in that way: there aren't many funding mechanisms like that.'

Page also criticised the current boom which say investors throwing money and startups with little chance of changing the world.

A Google smart contact lens that can monitor the glucose levels in the eye is being developed in a partnership with Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis. It  works using tiny sensors and microchips fitted into contact lenses that can then measure and read the amount of glucose in tears, before sending the information to a mobile device so diabetics can manage their condition.

He estimates that only about 50 investors are chasing the real breakthrough technologies that have the potential to make a material difference to the lives of most people on earth. 

Google has unprecedented resources brought about by its search and web advertising dominance, which has seen countries become uneasy in the face of a company that wields so much influence over a universal resource such as the internet.
