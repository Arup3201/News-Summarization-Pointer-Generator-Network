She's had a rough few years, and though things appeared to be looking up for Camille Grammer, she's found herself in the middle of more drama.

Though she has moved on from her broken marriage to Frasier star Kelsey Grammer, her new boyfriend's ex is creating problems.

According to RadarOnline.com, the mother of Dimitri Charalambopoulos' child, ex-girlfriend Lisa Chynoweth, threatened Camille during a crucial time during her own divorce proceedings.

This caused the 43-year-old to counter-attack: she threatened Lisa with lawyers and public embarrassment as she tried to protect her privacy.

The site reports that Lisa called Camille and sneakily recorded a four hour chat between Dimiti's ex and current girlfriends.

During the taped recording, the former Playboy model tells Lisa: 'If you go to the press, I have lawyers that are beyond what you can imagine and they will pull stuff on you and you will be so mortified about your life and your family and what you have done. You don't want to do that to Marcus [her son].'

Camille, naturally, had no knowledge that she was being recorded or that her words could be used against her boyfriend, as Dimitri is currently embroiled in a nasty custody battle with his ex for care of their five-year-old son.

He even has a temporary restraining order against his ex because of the situation after she leaked the video deposition tape.

A source tells Radar: 'Lisa is the one that called Camille about a month and a half ago and she had a laundry list of issues she needed to address.

'Camille was very gracious in the beginning of the conversation and just let Lisa talk. Camille had a lot going on in her life because she was still in a custody dispute with Kelsey.

'Towards the end of the conversation, Lisa told Camille that the press had been calling her and brought up Camille's children. Lisa knew about the custody battle and threatened to insert herself into that situation. Camille was provoked and reacted as any mother that loves her children would, period.

'Camille didn't threaten Dimitri's son, Marcus, she was simply saying that no child should have to deal with the fallout of their parents feuding.

The tape was aired as evidence in a video deposition between Dimitri, a bankruptcy attorney, and his ex. When Lisa's attorney asks Dimitri if he thinks it's ok that Camille threatens his ex and his son, he replies, 'I'm not going to answer that because I didn't hear the rest of the conversation and I don't want to hear the whole conversation...I didn't hear a threat and I don't know what that conversation was about and it was a little snippet and that has absolutely nothing to do with this...I didn't hear a threat, it sounded more like a rebuttal.'

According to the insider, Lisa edited the tape for her own gain.Â

The source reports: 'Dimitri wasn't with Camille when the phone call was made and they both find it extremely interesting that only a snippet of the conversation was recorded.

'Lisa didn't record the portions of the phone call when Camille praised what a great dad Dmitri was and what an amazing little boy they were raising.

'Lisa purposefully recorded when she had provoked Camille and attempted to use it against her. How did the deposition end up on YouTube? The lawyers involved are the only ones that have access to that information.' The drama has not affected Dimitri and Camille's relationship, however. In fact, she is reportedly happier than ever since filing for divorce from Grammer, her husband of 14 years, in 2010.

Says the site: 'Dimitri and Camille have never been closer and more in love. Camille has handled herself with true class and Dimitri is so grateful to have her in his life.

'Neither one of them thought they were ever going to find true love again and be able to trust someone with their heart. They are a fantastic couple and are rock solid.'

She told Good Morning America's guest correspondent Katie Couric yesterday that she left her Bravo reality show after just two seasons in order to regain her privacy in relation to her boyfriend and children.
