Katarina Johnson-Thompson has withdrawn from the Great Britain team for the European Championships in Zurich.

The 21-year-old heptathlete, who had been due to compete in the long jump in Switzerland, has still not recovered sufficiently from the foot injury which ruled her out of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

British Athletics said in a statement that 'taking the longer-term view rather than short-term risk' would ensure her winter training programme was not compromised.

Withdrawn: Katarina Johnson-Thompson has failed to recover from her foot injury in time for the Euros

Disappointing: Phillips Idowu will also miss the European Championships in Zurich to improve his form

Missing: A thigh injury sustained in the Commonwealth Games long jump final also rules Shara Proctor out

Recovery: Johnson-Thompson had been due to compete in the long-jump in Zurich but has had to withdraw

However, missing both of this season's major championships is still a major blow for the Liverpool athlete, who had been enjoying a superb season. She would have been favourite for heptathlon gold in Glasgow and a very strong medal contender in Zurich next week.

Shara Proctor, who pulled out of the Commonwealth long jump final after picking up a thigh injury, has also pulled out of the Europeans.

Phillips Idowu has withdrawn after finishing a disappointing fifth at the Commonwealths to focus on training and rediscovering his best form, while Sebastian Rodger has replaced Dai Greene in the 400m hurdles after the former world champion failed to achieve the qualifying standard for Zurich.

Mo Farah, who pulled out of the Commonwealths following illness, is still due to compete over 5,000 and 10,000 metres, though.

Medal prospect: Mo Farah is expected to feature in both the 5,000m and 10,000m in Zurich after illness

Champion: The double Olympic gold medallist has recovered in time to take part in the Euros

Javelin thrower Goldie Sayers has been named as the British team captain for the event, having fought her way back to fitness from a career-threatening elbow injury.

'Having had a fairly nightmarish past 18 months - and not knowing whether I'd ever throw or compete again - getting back into the GB vest alone has been incredible. To say captaincy is an added bonus, is a massive understatement,' the 32-year-old said.

British Athletics performance director Neil Black said: 'I was delighted to offer Goldie this captaincy. She has a career that has spanned both junior and senior ranks that sets a real example to the youngsters making that transition.'

The European Championships get under way on Tuesday.

Skipper: Javelin thrower Goldie Sayers will captain the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team in Zurich

Bonus: Sayers says the captaincy is an added extra because she is just happy to be competing after injury
