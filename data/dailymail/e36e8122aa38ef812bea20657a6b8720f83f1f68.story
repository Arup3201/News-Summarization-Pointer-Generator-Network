Likely presidential candidate and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul doubled down on comments his wife made in an interview with Vogue magazine: former President Bill Clinton is a 'predator.'

Paul was referring, of course, to the former president's multiple flings with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

Further, Paul says Bill Clinton's past indiscretions could be fair game if his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were to also make a run at the White House.

Denial: Bill Clinton infamously claimed he never had sex with 20-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky

'Predator': Senator Rand Paul says Clinton's 'predatory' behavior undermines claims the GOP is waging a 'war on women'

The Kentucky senator went on to use Clinton's affair with Lewinsky to defend Democratic claims that Republicans have 'waged a war on women.'

'One of the workplace laws and rules that I think are good is that 
bosses should not prey on young interns in their office. And I think 
really the media seems to have given President Clinton a pass on this,' Paul said during an appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday. 
'He took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his 
office. There is no excuse for that, and that is predatory behavior….. 
Then they (Democrats) have the gall to stand up and say, "Republicans 
are having a war on women.'"

'Define "is"': Clinton was later forced to admit that he had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and 'misled' people about it

Billary: It is suspected that Hillary Clinton will run for president in 2016 and Paul says Bill's affairs could be fair game in criticizing his wife

Implying that it would be unfair to judge Hillary Clinton on the shameful acts of her husband, host David Gregory asked Paul if he felt the Lewinsky scandal would play a role in the 2016 presidential election if Hillary were to run.

Paul was careful to dodge the question.

'It’s not Hillary’s fault, but it is a factor in judging Bill Clinton in history,' he said, adding that 'sometimes it's hard to separate one from the other.

In January of 1998, Bill Clinton infamously told the American public 'I did not have a sexual relationship with that woman - Ms. Lewinsky...'

Pop culture: Clinton's affair with Lewinsky has been lampooned in the media and elsewhere more than any other political scandal

Several months later, he was forced to admit that he 'misled' people, and that he had engaged in an 'inappropriate' sexual relationship with the young intern.

Following Paul's appearance on the show, Democratic Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin was the guest and he defended both Clintons, saying that Bill Clinton's sexual behaviors 'were litigated in the public square for over a decade.'

'Let’s judge Hillary Clinton based on her talents and her vision of America should she choose to run for president,' Durbin continued.
