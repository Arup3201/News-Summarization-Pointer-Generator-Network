Dan Dotson, the star of hit TV show Storage Wars, is recovering from an emergency operation after collapsing at his California home earlier this week.

Auctioneer Dotson, who is worth an estimated $3.5 million, suffered a double brain aneurysm on Monday morning.

He was rushed to hospital by his wife and co-star Laura Dotson, and had been given between 4 to 20 percent chance of survival.

The reality TV star, who is in his early 60s, had complained of double vision and had been 'asking weird questions in his sleep', Mrs Dotson told TMZ.

After he collapsed at the family home, Dotson's wife performed CPR while a 911 dispatcher gave her instructions over the phone.

Doctors discovered the auctioneer had one aneurysm behind his eye, and a second one, the size of an apricot, in his neck.

On Tuesday the star had emergency surgery and is said to making good progress.

On Thursday night his wife gave fans of their TV show an update, tweeting that he had 'made it through a difficult surgery. Now on the road to recovery'.

The day before he was rushed to hospital, Dotson had been celebrating Father's Day with his wife and son.

He had posted a picture of them together on Twitter, and written: 'Great end 2 a terrific weekend. Now it's time 2 go back 2 work. Huge x45 Auction week CA & AZ.'

The Dotsons shot to fame on the Storage Wars reality show in 2010, in which teams compete to auction off the contents of containers that they have had only a few minutes to examine.
