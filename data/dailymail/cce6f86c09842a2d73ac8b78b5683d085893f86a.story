A Channel 4 drama broadcast last night sparked outrage after it depicted a mass shooting in a primary school.

The opening scene of conspiracy thriller Utopia - in which a group of strangers go on the run after gaining possession of a graphic novel manuscript - saw Arby (played by Neil Maskell) walking into a classroom of children before firing several times.

He also shoots a young boy cowering in the school hall, and a mother in the head in front of her young daughter at their home.

Although a graphic content warning was given before the third episode, screened after the watershed, at 10pm - and the violence took place off-screen - many viewers found the scenes extremely disturbing.

Channel Four said it has so far 
received 28 complaints about the programme, while Ofcom is believed to 
have received around 20.

Among the comments on Twitter were: 
'Shooting children in a school. Never watching that again'; while 
another wrote: 'I reckon Channel 4 are going to have some Ofcom 
paperwork to deal with in the morning.'

And another tweeted: 'One of the most shocking things I've seen on TV'.

Although filmed over a year ago, Channel Four made a conscious decision to air Utopia just a month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut, which saw 20 children killed last December 14.

A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'Channel 4 thought very carefully about continuing with the planned broadcast of Utopia. 

'The drama is in no way based on real events, and the scenes featuring violence are editorially justified within the context of the storyline.  

'All material has been carefully considered in accordance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code and we were satisfied that, appropriately scheduled in a late night slot at 10pm and preceded by clear on-air warnings about the graphic violence and very strong language, it could be broadcast as planned.'

Some of the comments posted on Twitter which expressed disgust at the show's content

The show was created by Dennis Kelly, whose other writing credits include hit TV shows Spooks, Pulling and Matilda The Musical on stage.

Set in modern-day Britain, Utopia concerns a small group of geeks from an online comic forum who stumble upon the second installment of The Utopia Experiments.

Within its artwork are said to be 
predictions of the worst events in world history, such as the BSE  
outbreak - and sinister organisation The Network is prepared to kill to 
track it down.

Also drawn into the plot is a civil 
servant coerced into buying huge stocks of Russian flu vaccine, which 
coincidentally then triggers an outbreak in the UK.

Fiona O'Shaughnessy as the mysterious Jessica Hyde in the show; right, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett stars as IT consultant Ian, who is forced to go on the run after unwittingly becoming involved in the conspiracy

The tone of the series was set in the first episode, which features Arby and his associate murdering the occupants of a comic book shop - and a torture scene which saw one character, conspiracy theorist Wilson Wilson, have chilli powder and bleach poured into his eye, before it is gouged out with a spoon.

The cast features stalwarts such as Stephen Rea and James Fox (who work for The Network); Geraldine James (as an MI5 agent); along with Michael Dugdale (from The Thick Of It) and the fugitives - Becky (Alexandra Roach), Ian (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), Wilson (Adeel Akhtar), and 11-year-old Grant (Oliver Woollford), plus the mysterious Jessica Hyde (Fiona O'Shaughnessy).

Last night's episode attracted around 1million viewers.
