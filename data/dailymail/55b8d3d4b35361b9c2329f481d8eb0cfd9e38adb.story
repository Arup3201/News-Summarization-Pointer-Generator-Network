A young mother of two was trapped inside her wrecked minivan for nearly ten hours after she crashed into woods in Yarmouth, Massachusetts.

Megan Lynn Haley, 27, told rescuers that the last thing she remembers is driving at around 10 p.m. on Wednesday night. She was eventually extricated from her destroyed vehicle around 45 minutes after she was discovered at 7 a.m. on Thursday.

Haley is a widowed mother of two young daughters after her husband Shane Raymond Haley died aged 23 in 2008.

Wrecked: The vehicle that Megan Haley was trapped in for ten hours was so badly damaged that it took 45 minutes to cut her out

Haley's mangled Honda Odyssey was found on its side at least 20 feet into the woods by a man walking his dogs on Thursday morning.

Yarmouth Police Department Chief Steven Xiarhos told Whdh.com: 'The woman was trapped upside down with her head underneath the dashboard.' The woman couldn't reach her phone after flipping the vehicle over.

Temperatures in the area dropped into the 20s overnight. In the morning, first responders worked for around 30 minutes before they could reach Haley to administer medical attention. The police and fire department took around 45 minutes using chainsaws and the Jaws of Life to remove the woman from the minivan.

She suffered life-threatening injuries but is currently in a stable condition having been flown to aÂ  Boston hospital.

The Boston Herald reported that a neighbor 'heard a vehicle go by at a high rate of speed and a crashing noise' on Wednesday night.

The woman said that she 'felt bad' for not alerting authorities. She had after talked herself out of ringing police as she 'wasn't sure what she heard.'

Haley has two young daughters. She was widowed when her husband, Shane Raymond Haley, a landscape gardener, died at their home in 2008.

His obituary in the Cape Cod Times claimed that the 23-year-old had been an avid fan of the Boston Red Sox and enjoyed spending time with his family.

Authorities paid tribute to the first responders who saved Megan Haley's life. Yarmouth Fire Chief Mike Walker said: 'The guys really put a heck of a lot of work into it. They did a magnificent job.'

Police chief  Xiarhos stated: 'Thank God she is still with us. We want her to recover and tell us what happened, and we are confident that will happen.'
