Winds of up to 84mph hit Wales yesterday, causing falling trees, power cuts and road closures.

And other parts of the UK must be ready for heavy rainfall and wind today, the Met Office has warned.

The national weather service has issued a warning for southern England, alerting public to the risk of localised flooding - particularly along the coast. Scotland is also expected to be badly hit by rainfall.

According to the BBC, around 10,000 homes across southern and western parts of Wales were without power yesterday.

A Western Power Distribution spokesman said the outages were rare, but the weather was to blame.

'It's purely wind,' he said. 'As you know, it's been blowing quite a gale here.'

Meanwhile, the M4 was closed in both directions between Margam and Pyle after a caravan overturned in the winds.

But Natural Resources Wales said only one flood warning remained in place in coastal Wales despite fears over high tides.

Forecasters predict the 'unsettled weather' will mar most of the weekend, although it is not expected to be as bad as the powerful St Jude storm.

Last night, winds of between 50-60mph lashed the British Isles, while coastal areas were expected to see gusts of 70mph.

The main focus for the bad weather today will be across the south coast of England and Scotland, but north-west England and Wales are also expected to see their fair share of wind and rain.

Experts said there was a risk of thunder last night in the south-west of England but they said the rain would begin to clear 
from the west towards dawn.

The Met Office said eastern areas of the UK will fair better today - but will not escape the bad weather entirely.

A spokesman from the weather service said to expect a drier and less windy day on Monday.

There are fears the latest spell of 
disruptive weather will hamper recovery efforts following the impact of 
the worst storm in Britain for 26 years, which killed five people.

Tim
Fields of the Energy Networks Association said: 'A lot of the places 
that are still without power are quite remote, with small numbers of 
people where there are downed power lines.

'All
the network operators will be in close contact with the Met Office 
during the weekend and we hope to have everyone back on supply by the 
end of next week.

'Flooding does not normally present a huge threat to the energy infrastructure but extensive flooding would definitely pose a risk.'

Billy Payne, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said the latest spell of unwelcome weather will not be a repeat of last weekâ€™s powerful storm.

'It will not be welcomed but it is not expected to be anywhere near as bad as last week.

Despite what this scene in Aberystwyth may suggest, the Natural Resources Wales said only one flood warning remained in place in coastal areas of Wales this evening

'It will still be windy but the main risk this weekend is of lots of heavy rain.

'On top of the rain we have already had it could lead to flash flooding, particularly on Sunday.'

Meanwhile, last month was one of the mildest Octobers on record.

Gemma Plumb, another forecaster with MeteoGroup, said the new month will bring 'drier and chillier weather as would be expected in November', after October was confirmed as the mildest the UK has seen since 2006.

The south west, south Wales and Midlands saw the highest above average temperatures, at 1.5C warmer than is usual for the month.

But although it was milder than usual, it was also the least sunny October since 2005 and the wettest in England and Wales since 2000, Ms Plumb said.
