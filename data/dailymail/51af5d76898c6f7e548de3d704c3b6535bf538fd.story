Occurrences of full-frontal nudity on prime-time, network television have soared by an incredible 6,300 per cent in the last year.

There were a total of 64 cases of people 
going au naturel on the five major networks - CBS, NBC, FOX, ABC, and
the CW - in the 2011-12 season.

That figure stands in remarkable contrast to the single instance of full-frontal nudity the year before.

In the Buff: This shot from the May 29, 2012 episode of Cougar Town contributed to the shocking rise - 6,300 per cent - in cases of full front nudity on network television during the 2011-'12 primetime season

The slow trend from Buck Rogers to 'buck naked' began in the '90s with shows like NYPD Blue, but has become old-hat for current titles like The Office, Two and a Half Men, The Bachelor, and Don't Trust the B ---- in Apartment 23, all cited in The Parents Television Council (PTC) study.

In all, the analysis recorded 76 incidents of 'full nudity' on 37 shows during the 2011-12 prime-time network lineup. 

During the prior season, or from 2010-11, PTC notched just 15 instances on 14 shows. That's a 407 per cent jump over the course of a single year, alone.

The study, which tracked TV shows 
from September 1 to May 31, drew the distinction between full nudity 
and full-frontal nudity.

The networks used 
various techniques to blur character's sex organs from the audience's 
view, the study showed.

The numbers exclude any animated 
nudity or suggested full nudity in which a person is assumed to be nude 
on the top, but a portion of their body is blocked by a 
conveniently-placed table or sofa, for instance.

Calling HR!: Among the biggest offenders was NBC's hit show, The Office, which often showed characters baring it all, as was the case in this January episode

The study recorded a 2700% jump in the use of blurring or pixilation to cover body parts - as is the case in the scene from The Office - in 2011-'12 compared to the prior year, when networks did so only two times

In all, the study cited 76 incidents of 'full nudity' on 37 shows, like The Bachelor, pictured above, in 2011-'12. On the last season, or during 2010-'11, the Parents Television Council notched 
just 15 instances on 14 shows

Network Nudity: The study, which cited this scene from a January episode of the show Suburgatory, focused on the prime-time lineups of the five major networks, or NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, and the CW.

However, the study did include scenes in which individuals are completely unclothed and only the sexual organ is blocked from the viewer.

The study focused on prime-time, broadcast television, including network specials, but excluding news and sports.

Surprisingly, the study stated that almost 70 per cent of the scenes showing full nudity during the 2011–12 study period were on shows that aired before 9pm and as early as 7pm.

In comparison, a half of the full nudity scenes recorded aired after 9pm the previous year.

Of the five major networks, NBC actors most often appeared in the buff, with the study recording 37 occurrences of its characters going nude during the 2011-'12 prime-time season.

Second was ABC with 24 recorded instances, while CBS came in third with eight cases of full nudity. Fox and the CW brought up the rear, so to speak, with three and four instances, respectively.

NBC actors most often appeared in the buff, with the study recording 37 cases of its characters going nude during 2011-'12. Second was ABC with 24 instances, like this one from Don't Trust the B ---- in Apartment 23

Almost 70 per cent of the scenes showing full nudity during the 2011–'12
study period, like this one from So You Think You Can Dance, were on shows that aired before 9:00 p.m. and as early as 
7:00 p.m.

Oh Howie: The numbers exclude any animated nudity or suggested full nudity in which a person is assumed to be nude, but a portion of their body is blocked by a conveniently-placed table or sofa, for instance
