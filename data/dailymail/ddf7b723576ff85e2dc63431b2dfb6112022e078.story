A man from upstate New York decided to turn his snow day into a video project on Wednesday and sent his drone out into the snow to see what splendor it could capture.

James Grimaldi of West Seneca New York sent his drone flying over the snow-covered houses and frosted trees.

What the drone filmed was a series of romantic winter images from a perspective that resembles gazing into a holiday snow globe. 

Covered: There isn't an inch of road in sight in the heavily snowed on Upstate New York area

AccuWeather.com reports that West Seneca got 65.1 inches of snow late Tuesday night through Friday but wasn't the most snowed on area.

'The areas that got hit the hardest were farther away from the lake than West Seneca and had lower temperatures,' AccuWeather.com Expert Meteorologist Brett Anderson said.

'In West Seneca, the air was warmer and the snow was heavier and wetter, so it compacted more than fluffy snow would have,' he added.

In Lancaster New York over 74 inches fell and plows couldn't even keep up with the demand.
