Earlier this season I picked Thierry Henry as my greatest-ever Premier League striker. 

One look at the tributes paid to him on Tuesday show plenty of people would agree. Thierry had it all. Pace, power, skill, intelligence — it was the perfect combination. 

But he backed up all that talent with trophies. When he was in the zone, he was almost unstoppable and single-handedly won us matches on more than one occasion.

When he arrived, I sat with him in the stands at a testimonial. He spoke little English but he was purring over Ian Wright’s movement. If he can learn the punditry game as fast as he did the real one, he’ll be the best in the business by next Christmas!

The club asked if I would let him have my No 14 shirt because Henry wanted it. I was after Steve Bould’s old No 5 so I agreed, although I’m sure people will remember him wearing 14 more than me! 

He is still the best athlete I’ve ever seen wear a pair of football boots and when he scored his first goal I said I’d be able to tell my grandchildren I had played with him. He gave me a puzzled look. 

After the career he had, maybe now he sees why.
