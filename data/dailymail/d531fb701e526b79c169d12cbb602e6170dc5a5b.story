The Olympic dreams of British judoka Gemma Howell ended in tears and heartbreak today as she was controversially disqualified from her first round bout.

There were boos from the partisan home crowd at the ExCeL Centre when Howell, 22, picked up a passivity penalty with two minutes remaining of her clash with reigning world and European champion Gevrise Emane of France.

But things got worse when, with only 30 seconds to go, the fighters fell to the ground and video referees ruled that Howell had illegally grabbed her opponent's leg - meaning an automatic disqualification.

Direct attacks to the legs have been outlawed under new rule changes introduced since the last Olympics.

Howell, one of Sportsmail's Magnificent Seven whose progress this paper has tracked since 2005, had taken the fight to her opponent during the early stages at the start of her under-63kg category bout, roared on by the home crowd.

But the judoka from Wolverhampton could have no complaints about the ruling.

She said: 'I think it was the right decision. I was down a penalty towards the end of the fight and knew she was ahead on attacks, so I had nothing to lose.

'I felt it was a situation which a few years ago would have been fine, but it is not allowed any more. I went for it and I shouldn't have.'

Howell, who trains at the British Judo Performance Institute in Dartford, Kent, battled through injury in order to reach the Games and her bout with Emane represented a big step up in class.

Nine months ago, she suffered anterior cruciate ligament knee injury which put her Olympics participation in severe doubt. She only resumed full training in March after surgery and months of rehabilitation, making the British team in June.

She added: 'Maybe when I go home and look at it again I can be positive, but right now I am completely gutted.

'I didn't come here to fight hard, I came here to win it, so I didn't do what I wanted to.

'It's what makes being an Olympic champion in judo so special - that you do only get that one chance every four years.

'Rio will be the next big thing for me now, but I will just have to wait for that.'

Elsewhere, Euan Burton offered no 
excuses after seeing his hopes of judo gold shattered with defeat to 
Canadian Antoine Valois-Fortier in the men's under-81kg.

Burton,
33, had once been ranked as high as fourth in his weight division, but 
last year struggled to make an impact at either the European or World 
Championships.

Valois-Fortier was not the expected 
opposition for the Scotsman, after knocking out Elnur Mammadli of 
Azerbaijan, the reigning European champion who won Olympic gold at 
under-73kg in Beijing.

However,
the Canadian again produced the goods, this time with an ippon throw to
end Burton's Olympic dream before it had the chance to get going.

'I
lost in the biggest tournament in the world, the biggest Britain is 
ever going to see in my lifetime, I don't really know what else to say, 
but that is judo, people can get caught,' said Burton, who was choking 
back the tears afterwards.

'I have caught people quickly in the past, and people have caught me quickly before. The fight was pretty even up to that point, but I felt I was going to be able to dominate the fight. I did not feel any particular threat until then, but it was a beautiful bit of judo.'

Burton felt he was in top condition to deliver.

'I felt fantastic, my preparation probably could not have gone any better, that is the most disappointing thing,' he said.

'If I had poor preparation, things had not gone well, then you can use all of the excuses, but there are no excuses.

'I came in feeling one million percent that I could win the tournament and that I was in the best shape of my life.

'If you are in the best shape of your life and you go out in the first round, then maybe that is telling you something.'

Elsewhere on the fourth day of the Olympics in London, Britain picked up their fourth medal with silver in the equestrian three-day eventing.

The British quintet, which includes the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips, finished second behind Germany.

Tina Cook entered the final showjumping round knowing a run consisting of less than seven points would earn Team GB silver and she responded with just one time penalty to the delight of the home crowd.

Their brave gold medal challenge ultimately came up short as European champions and Olympic title favourites Germany took gold, with New Zealand clinching bronze.

David Florence crashed out of the canoe slalom after finishing below the cut-off qualification time for the final.

The 29-year-old from Aberdeen is the world number one but his effort of 106.16 seconds, including a two second penalty, wasn't good enough.

He has another chance of a medal when
he competes in the semi-final of the C2 - the two-man boat - on 
Thursday with team-mate Richard Hounslow.

Florence
said: 'I am very disappointed obviously that it didn't go well enough. I
have wanted to perform at this event for the last four years and not to
do so is very frustrating.

'But
it's part of the sport of canoe slalom - some days it doesn't go your 
way. As far as I am aware, I didn't go fast enough anywhere on the whole
course. There wasn't one mistake that cost me time, it was the whole 
way.

'All I was trying to do was put in a 
great run the whole way and that is all I was really concentrating on. 
It's easy to say it was the pressure of the home crowd (that got to me) 
but this is a very up and down sport and today I wasn't good enough.'

Highlights
later in the day include the women's team gymnastics final and the 
women's football match at Wembley between GB and Brazil.

Florence, the world number one, found it tough going in the C-1 canoe slalom heats and failed to qualify for the final
