Experts found evidence of animals forming cliques and gathering information to help make group decisions - in much the same way as humans use Facebook Groups to streamline discussions

Humans didn't invent 'social networks', says a new study into animal behaviour - instead, our use of networks such as Facebook and Twitter actually mirrors group behaviours that can be found in whales, monkeys  and dolphins.

Intelligent animals 'use' groups to share information with one another - albeit without computers or smartphones - just like humans do online.

Experts found evidence of animals 
forming cliques and gathering information to help make group decisions -
in much the same way as humans use Facebook Groups to streamline 
discussions.

The famous 'six degrees of separation' rule - which states that anyone can be related to another person in six steps - also applies to the way animals group with one another.

The findings apply across dolphins, whales, primates and hooved animals.

The sharing of information through social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook actually reflects tactics animals have always used to gather information about their social environment.

The study was conducted by Dr David Lusseau, of the University of Aberdeen’s School of Biological Sciences.

He said: 'Social networks are the same across all species and, whilst details of their structure may differ, some properties remain the same whether we are looking at killer whales, spider monkeys or, indeed, humans.'

'For example, the famous concept of six degrees of separation - the idea that everyone is linked by common acquaintances to any other person on Earth - holds true across the animal kingdom.'

'Our studies into animal populations showed the ‘small world effect’ is prevalent in the animal kingdom.'

'Also, we see cliques form in different species of animals in the same way as we ourselves experience in our day-to-day lives.'

Dr Lusseau will discuss his findings in a talk next week as part of the university’s Cafe Scientifique series.

He said: 'I will explain that the driver behind the formation of social networks in the animal kingdom is information-gathering.'

'This information differs between species and populations - so it could be where food is, where predators are, or how strong you are in comparison to the other animals around you which would make you more of less likely to win in a fight.'

“Schools of dolphins provide an example of this. As individuals, dolphins have their own daily needs to fulfil, such as resting and eating, but they are also concerned with what they should do next as a group.'“We find that group leaders can emerge simply in particular cases because they might know the current context better than other members of the group.'

Dr Lusseau believes the evolution of social media mimics the evolution of social networks in the animal kingdom.

He said: 'The social-networking technology most of us now employ on a daily basis helps us to behave at a global scale in the same way we do with people we see every day.'

'It’s allowing us to share information with one another in the way that animals across the kingdom have always communicated, the only difference being that we can do it on a global level.'

'In many ways the evolution of social media is converging with the evolution of the way animals use social information.'

His talk, entitled Did Animals Invent Twitter?, will take place at Waterstone’s Union Bridge in Aberdeen at 7pm next Wednesday.
