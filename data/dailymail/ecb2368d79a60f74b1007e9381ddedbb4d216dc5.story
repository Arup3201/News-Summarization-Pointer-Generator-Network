A 14-year-old has admitted manslaughter after he threw a single punch at Paul Walker, who later died 

A 14-year-old has admitted killing a man celebrating the new year with a single punch, while his friends filmed the attack on a mobile phone. 

Paul Walker, 52, from Blackpool, Lancashire, was thought to have been celebrating the start of 2015 before he was found lying unconscious in a street at the seaside resort at around 2am on January 1 and later died. 

Police said footage of the attack, which show the teenager being encouraged to throw the punch by two older men, was filmed on a mobile phone but has since been deleted, Preston Crown Court heard. 

The court heard that Mr Walker, a Celtic fan who had lived in Blackpool for at least 10 years, died of injuries to his head, face and neck.

The teenager, who cannot be named, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. 

He was initially charged with murder but prosecutors decided to accept the lesser charge.

Nicholas Clarke QC, prosecuting, said: 'There were a number of witnesses who all similarly relate to a friendly encounter with the deceased.

'Unexpectedly there was this one punch thrown by the defendant.'

Defending, Julie Taylor said the incident was filmed on a mobile phone which showed the boy being encouraged to throw the punch.

She said: 'Police can confirm there was a video but they have been unable to retrieve it because it had been deleted from the phone.

'They're going to use their best endeavours to see if anyone has a copy or whether it's on social media anywhere.'

After he was found Mr Walker was rushed to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where he later died.

Mr Walker was a Celtic fan and is believed to have been celebrating the start of 2015 near his Blackpool home

The Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell, adjourned the case until April 10 and told the boy the 'first option the court will consider is custody, not withstanding your age.'

Mr Walker was born in the Pollok area of Glasgow and was a dedicated Celtic fan. 

Describing himself on Facebook as a 'graduate from Glasgow Caledonian University' he posted a series of photographs of himself in his Celtic shirt and images showing support for Celtic and previous manager Neil Lennon.

He also posted a series of photos of his young son.

The father was found lying unconscious in Sutton Place, Blackpool, at about 2am on January 1

Mr Walker had lived in Blackpool for at least 10 years.

His sister Harriet posted a photo online of the two of them together with the caption: 'My lovely brother. Can't take it in, we never see each other again.' 

His nephew Luke said: 'I'm in bits. We has such a good night as well. Then this happened.'
