Germany may have won the FIFA World Cup but Australia has toppled the nation to take out the coveted RoboCup 2014 - held in Brazil.

The University of NSW robot football team, rUNSWift, were ruthless in their march to the finals, racking up 37 goals against 19 international teams with no goals conceded.

In the electrifying final of the standard platform league, UNSW were galvanised into action after Nao – Team HTWK from Leipzig University of Applied Sciences took early possession.

The UNSW robots struck back with an early goal and kept up the pressure to defeat their rivals 5-1 while B-Human, another German team who were the defending champions, took third place.

In the standard platform league all teams compete with identical robots but different software.

The UNSW team wrote an impressive 125,000 lines of code to help their 15 robot protégés to victory.

The robots are autonomous however they do need the occasional helping hand to get back on their feet after a tricky tackle.

Brad Hall from the UNSW Computer Science and Engineering School said beating B-Human in the semi-final had been seven years in the making.

‘Unfortunately, during the final, after our goalie saved an attempt, he fell over and while trying to get back up and in position we conceded the only goal during the entire competition' he said. ‘To win the overall tournament, as well as the demo ‘All-Stars vs Champions’, wrapped up a great year.’

‘Some of our longer-serving team members can now retire from the league with big smiles on their faces,’ Mr Hall said. ‘For our new members, I hope they are inspired to help us defend the title next year in China.’

Head of UNSW Computer Science and Engineering, Maurice Pagnucco congratulated the team and coach Bernhard Hengst for their long nights in the lab.

‘This result showcases UNSW and Australian research expertise in robotics internationally,’ he said.

There are four robot football divisions in RoboCup, the world’s largest robot competition: small size, middle size, humanoid league and standard platform league.

The UNSW team last won the competition in 2003, although they were runners-up in 2010 and have regularly placed in the top three teams.

The expertise developed on the playing field was expected to be translated into more serious research including robotic systems for applications in health, transport and industry.

In the meantime, UNSW’s athletic androids will soak up the limelight, and a little electricity, before heading home to much-deserved fanfare in Australia.
