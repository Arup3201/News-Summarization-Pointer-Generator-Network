A Chinese man has posted photographs of him posing next to an 'alien' which he claims to have trapped after it crash landed.

The pictures of Mr Li standing next to 
the rather crude looking extraterrestrial have sparked a frenzy of speculation social networking
 sites across China.

Mr Li claims he saw a formation of UFOs buzzing across the night sky along the Yellow River in Binzhou Shangdong province.

Far fetched: Mr Li had claimed he found an alien on the banks of the Yellow River and stored it in his freezer

Outlandish claims: The bizarre figure was constructed from rubber by the farmer

Suddenly, one of the crafts plummeted
 to earth and soon afterwards Mr Li discovered the charred remains of 
the visitor from outta space in a rabbit trap, he claims.

Mr Li insists he took the bizarre looking creature back to be stored in a freezer at his home after the crash-landing in March.

However, the outlandish claims were quickly brought back to earth.

Social networks across China were awash with frenzied speculation and conspiracy about the pictures

Mr Li even burnt the 'alien's' foot to make it look as if it had been electrocuted on one of his rabbit traps

Fake: According to a statement from Binzhou police the alien is fake and made entirely out of rubber

Police issued a statement saying the 
rather unconvincing figure at the bottom of a chest freezer was, in 
fact, not another life form but high quality rubber.

'The alien purported
 electrocuted and discovered by a man in Binzhou is a high quality 
imitation,' the Jinan Police posted on their Sina microblog. 'The body 
is made up of high quality rubber.'

Undeterred by the police attempts to pour scorn on the possibility the alien is real, Chinese bloggers are busy 
trying to connect the Shandong alien to a purported UFO siting in Hubei 
province.
