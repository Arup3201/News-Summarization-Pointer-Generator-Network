Probe: City watchdogs will look at high-interest cards dubbed 'payday loans with plastic'

The £150billion credit card market is to be investigated amid fears that nine million vulnerable customers are trapped in a spiral of debt.

City watchdogs will look at high-interest cards – dubbed ‘payday loans with plastic’ – and controversial no-interest deals that come with hefty penalties for those who miss a repayment.

The Financial Conduct Authority probe comes amid concerns that 18 per cent of  UK adults are vulnerable as they have too much debt.

FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley accused some lenders of pushing struggling households further into the red by dishing out credit cards.

He said more than a million customers pay off only the minimum of their balance each month. Many so-called ‘survival borrowers’ are juggling multiple cards and struggling to cope with their bills.

Mr Wheatley added that firms providing credit would have to examine ‘fundamental questions of culture, ethics, business models and the like’.

The investigation, to be launched later this year, is the FCA’s first major act since taking responsibility on Tuesday for regulating around 50,000 ‘consumer credit’ firms, including payday lenders and debt management companies.

But banks, building societies and other credit card providers will also fall under its scope.

Investigators will look into whether firms are selling suitable products to customers, whether the costs of credit are made clear at the outset, and how they deal with those who fall behind on repayments. 

One area likely to face scrutiny is the sale of hugely popular zero per cent balance transfer deals on credit cards.

As a ploy to attract new customers, 
some banks offer interest-free periods of up to 31 months on their 
debts. But the downside is those who miss a payment or do not pay in 
full once the interest-free period comes to an end can be hit with 
swingeing penalties.

Mr Wheatley also warned that consumers are being given the equivalent of ‘plastic pay day loans’ – high-interest credit cards with low credit limits of a couple of hundred pounds.

These tend to be offered for specialist lenders that cater for customers with poor credit records, such as Vanquis Bank.

He said: ‘Why are card issuers providing the means, in some cases, for the most indebted consumers to escalate their way into further debt?’

Consumer campaigners  welcomed the probe. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Too many credit cards appear to be designed to catch customers out.’

FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley questioned why so many people in debt are offered more credit

James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance, said: ‘The customers who end up paying hundreds of pounds in interest and charges are those who can least afford it.’

The regulator has the power to fine firms up to 10 per cent of annual sales. It can also refer the matter to the Competition and Markets Authority, which could break up companies.

About 56million credit cards are issued to around 30million UK customers, with £150billion spent on plastic last year. The total outstanding balance   stands at £57billion.

Meanwhile, 8.4million households have no savings, warned the FCA.

Richard Koch, head of policy at the UK Cards Association, said: ‘The industry has a long-standing commitment to responsible lending and transparency.’
