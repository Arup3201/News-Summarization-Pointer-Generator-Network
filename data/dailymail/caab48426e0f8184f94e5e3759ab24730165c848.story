Actress Celeste Holm lived at the apartment for over half a century

The high-ceilinged Manhattan apartment, owned by the late Broadway star, Celeste Holm, has been put on the market for $13.95million by the younger of her two estranged sons.  

Boasting spectacular views over the city, the duplex at 88 Central Park is where the star lived for more than half a century and died this July, aged 95.  

Dan Dunning, whose father was Holm's third husband, told the New York Times: 'She loved it because of the view of the park and the way she felt involvement with the seasons, just by looking through her windows.  

'Central Park in the spring was the time she enjoyed most.'  

Times
writer Robin Finn, who gained excusive access to the three-bedroom 
property described that like Holm, it 'possesses charisma - as well as 
enduring bone structure'.  

On
the lower floor he reveals that there is a dining room, butler's 
pantry, kitchen where the late actress 'loved to cook up batches of 
spaghetti and clam sauce'. 

And an airy living room is lined with windows overlooking the park at treetop height. 

Moving upstairs there are three sizable 
bedrooms, with ample closet space, and the master suite features full 
views to the north and east.  

Holm's son says that she moved into her corner duplex at the Brentmore, No 6N, in 1953 and bought it in 1958 after the building went co-op.  

However, since her marriage in 2004 to Frank Basile, a singer and waiter nearly 46 years her junior, she had been locked in a legal battle with her family over her over investments and inheritance.  

The court fight wiped away much of her 
savings and left her dependent on Social Security. The actress and her
sons no longer spoke, and she was sued for overdue maintenance and 
legal fees on her Manhattan apartment. 

Last
year a settlement was reached, entitling Mr Basile to a one-third share
in the proceeds from her estate and he was forced to vacate the 
property at 88 Central Park just five weeks after her death.

Mr Dunning, a real estate manager in Putnam County, who is Holm's son 
from her first marriage to Ted Nelson, an Internet pioneer, lives in 
California, added: "One of her desires as she aged was to never have to 
give up the apartment.'  

Holm had been hospitalized with dehydration after a fire in actor Robert De Niro's apartment in the same Manhattan building.  

She
had asked her husband to take her home, and she spent her final days 
with him, and other relatives and close friends by her side.

In a career that spanned more than half a century, Holm played everyone from Ado Annie - the girl who just can't say no in Oklahoma!- to a worldly theatrical agent in the 1991 comedy I Hate Hamlet to guest star turns on TV shows such as Fantasy Island and Love Boat II to Bette Davis' best friend in All About Eve.  

She won the Academy Award in 1947 
for best supporting actress for her performance in Gentlemen's Agreement
and received Oscar nominations for Come to the Stable (1949) and All 
About Eve (1950). 

Holm
was also known for her untiring charity work - at one time she served 
on nine boards - and was a board member emeritus of the National Mental 
Health Association.

The 
listing broker, Austin Schuster of Sotheby's International Realty, 
described her apartment as 'a fabulous canvas ready to transform again 
for a new owner.'

The 12-story building, on the corner of 69th Street and Central Park West, designed by Schwartz and Gross and built in 1910, has attracted numerous celebrities.  

Producer Lorne Michaels lives there, Sting was a former resident, and Robert De Niro bought a $20.9million duplex two floors below Holm's in 2006.  

Holm was married five times and is survived by two sons and three grandchildren.
