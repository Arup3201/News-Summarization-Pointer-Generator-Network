A jihadist Twitter account said
the leader of the al Qaeda-linked Khorasan group was killed in a
U.S. air strike in Syria, SITE monitoring service said on Sunday
after several days of uncertainty over whether he survived the
raid.

A U.S. official said on Sept. 24 the United States believed
Mohsin al-Fadhli, a senior al Qaeda operative, had been killed
in a strike a day earlier, but the Pentagon said several hours
later it was still investigating what had happened to him.

In a tweet posted on Sept. 27, a jihadist offered
condolences for the death of Kuwaiti-born Fadhli, otherwise
known as Abu Asmaa al-Kuwati or Abu Asmaa al-Jazrawi, said SITE,
a U.S.-based organisation that monitors militant groups online.

In Washington, Tony Blinken, deputy White House national
security adviser, said U.S. officials could not yet confirm the
death.

'We want to make sure that he's not trying to, in effect,
fake his death and go underground,' Blinken said on 'Fox News
Sunday.' 'But there are serious indicators he was removed.'

U.S. officials have described Khorasan as a network of
seasoned al Qaeda fighters with battlefield experience mostly in
Pakistan and Afghanistan that is now working in league with al
Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front.

Khorasan is a term for an area including parts of Pakistan
and Afghanistan where al Qaeda's main council is believed to be
in hiding.

After the Sept. 23 strikes, U.S. officials said they were 
still assessing how badly Khorasan had been hit. Islamist
militants on social media have said there were unconfirmed
reports that the 33-year-old Fadhli had been killed.

SITE did not name the jihadist who reported Fadhli's death
but said he had trained under a close associate of al Qaeda
leader Ayman al-Zawahri and had fought in Khorasan before
travelling to Syria.

A 2012 State Department notice offering a $7 million reward
for information on Fadhli's whereabouts said he was an al Qaeda
financier close to founder Osama bin Laden and among the few who
knew in advance about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Military leaders believe al-Fadhli could be faking his death and using the strike as an opportunity to go underground
