President Barack Obama's approval rating among the American public has reached an all-time low.

Just 41 percent of the country now approves of the job that Obama is doing, down five percent from a month ago, according to a new Washington Post- ABC News poll.

Dissatisfaction with healthcare reform continues to play a large role in Americans' disgruntlement with the President.

While Republicans are most unhappy with the President's implementation of his signature law, they are not alone in their displeasure.

Support for the healthcare law was 
upside down, with only 44 percent saying they supported the changes 
Obamacare made to the healthcare system, down from 49 percent a month 
ago.

Approval of Obama's handling of the 
healthcare law was predictably split down party lines, but among 
self-identified Independents, more than two-thirds strongly disapprove of the 
way the President has handled the implementation of his signature law.

Among all respondents, only
 37 percent approved of the way Obama is handling the healthcare law, and nearly twice as many respondents strongly disapproved of the 
President's implementation of Obamacare as those who 
strongly approved  - a mere 24 percent.

Worse, just 41 percent of respondents said implementation is going better than expected compared to when it began. 

Particularly telling of the level of discontent Obama faces over healthcare implementation is the low number of Republicans polled. Republicans only made up only two of every 10 people interviewed.

Implementation
 of the healthcare law got off to a notoriously bad start last October. 
The Obamacare sign up website healthcare.gov repeatedly crashed during 
the open enrollment period for the federal health exchanges, making 
Obama and his administration, namely Health and Human Services Secretary
 Kathleen Sebelius, look foolish.

The
 last day of Obamacare enrollment, March 31, was plagued with more 
problems related to the website's failure to function properly, forcing 
the Obama administration to extend sign-up time for Americans who tried 
to enroll in healthcare by the government mandated deadline but 
couldn't.

After
 first saying she would remain at the helm of HHS until next fall, 
Sebelius announced days later that she would soon leave the 
administration.

Democrats
 had hoped that Sebelius' departure would decrease Americans' annoyance 
with Obamacare. Obamacare numbers have only gotten worse, not better, 
since Sebelius' announcement, however, as vexation with the poorly 
implemented law lingers.

At issue for many Americans polled was the perceived cost increases that Obamacare has wreaked on their personal finances.

Only eight percent told pollsters they thought their personal health care costs 
are going down as a result of Obamacare. Nearly six times as many said 
their health care costs were increasing as because of the President's 
signature law.

Likewise, more than five times as many people said the country's 
healthcare costs were going up as a result of Obamacare than those who said they thought national health spending was going down.

It's unclear how much of an impact Americans' negative feelings about Obamacare will have on Democratic candidates competing in the nation's mid-term elections in November. Respondents in the poll said they trusted Democrats more to handle nearly every issue, including Obamacare, but pollsters interviewed a significantly higher number of Democrats than Republicans.

Of note is that double the percentage 
of respondents in the poll thought America was on the wrong track. Of those who felt
 America was on the wrong track, they were three times more 
likely to blame Democrats in Congress than Republicans. 

Respondents were split on who they'd personally vote for if the 
election were held today, the Democrat or Republican, but they were likely to say Republicans should be in charge in Congress to 
serve as a check President Obama than Democrats.

'This poll shows people want Republicans to fight back against the Obama agenda-- from foreign policy to ObamaCare and the economy, Republican National Committee spokesman Raffi Williams told MailOnline in an email. 'Those 2014 Democrats who have overwhelmingly supported the extreme Obama agenda are going to suffer at the election booths for putting donors interests above that of their constituents.'
