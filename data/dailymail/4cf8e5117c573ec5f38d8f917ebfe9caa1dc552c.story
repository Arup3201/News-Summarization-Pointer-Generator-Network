Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan were the second-largest philanthropists in the country last year as they gave away nearly half a billion dollars.

The Facebook founder and his pediatrician wife donated a total of $498.8million to charitable causes in 2012, putting them in line after billionaire Warren Buffett.

Mr Buffet gave more than six-times more than his younger counterparts, giving away $3.1billion to various causes, but it was the rapid ascent of the Zuckerbergs in the ranks of the country's philanthropists that comes as more of a surprise.

Power couple: Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan were listed as the second-largest donors in the country in 2012 after giving away $498.8million

Mr Zuckerberg, 28, made his first massive donation two years earlier when he announced that he was pledging $100million to the Newark school system in New Jersey.

Low key: The couple are notoriously private but Mr Zuckerberg has been public with his donations in the past

That donation was tainted with cynicism as it came around the same time as the film The Social Network which portrayed him in a somewhat negative light.

The spending spree didn't stop there, however, as The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported that he donated 18 million shares of Facebook stock to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2012.

The shares are valued at about $498.8million and he directed it towards the local group.

Education and health programs are two of the many ways that the non-profit directs their funds. 

'Together,
we will look for areas in education and health to focus on next. I'm 
hopeful we'll be able to have as positive an impact in our next set of 
projects,' Mr Zuckerberg posted on his Facebook page at the time of his 
December donation.

Aside from the donation to the Newark 
education system and the latest boost to the Silicon Valley fund, Mr 
Zuckerberg has used tools other than his deep pockets.

In
May of last year, Mr Zuckerberg said announced that he integrated a way
for Facebook users to publicize their role as organ donors in an effort
to connect those in need with people willing to help.

This was one of the clearest ways that his wife's interests influenced his charitable efforts.

First big donation: Mr Zuckerberg gave $100million to the Newark school system in 2010 and announced the move on Oprah Winfrey's talk show alongside New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Newark mayor Cory Booker

Other ways to help: Zuckerberg also used Facebook as a way to do charitable work as he incorporated an organ donation function into the social networking site in May 2012

As his then-girlfriend was studying pediatrics- and just months after it was revealed that Apple founder Steve Jobs underwent a liver transplant before he died- Mr Zuckerberg told how he felt the social network could help.

'She's in medical school now so our 
dinner conversations- she's going to be a pediatrian- are often about 
Facebook and kids and the kids that she's meeting. She has these stories
about she spends a lot of time with the patients she's treating she'll 
spend weeks with someone and getting to know them and see them getting 
sicker as they don't have the organ that they need,' he told ABC's Robin
Roberts. 

Other couples: Hedge funder John Arnold and his wife Laura were listed third (left) as Google co-founder Sergey Brin and his wife Anne Wojcicki came in fifth place (right)

'She comes home and her face is all lit up because someone's life is going to be better because of this.'
