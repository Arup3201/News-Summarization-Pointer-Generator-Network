Fighting broke out near the railway station at the heart of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk on Monday in what separatists said was an attempt by government forces to seize back the east Ukrainian city.

The government in Kiev denied sending the regular army into the centre of Donetsk, which the separatists captured in April, but said small 'self-organised' pro-Ukrainian groups were fighting the pro-Russian rebels in the city.

Four people were killed in clashes near the railway station and close to the airport outside Donetsk, local health officials said in the industrial city which was home to about one million people before many fled the fighting in the region.

But almost as quickly as the shelling started, it eased, leaving a control tower at the railway station with shattered windows.

Shakhtar Donetsk, the city's biggest football club, was plunged into turmoil today as six of its star foreign players refused to return to Ukraine for training.

Brazilians Douglas Costa (pictured), Fred, Dentinho, Alex Teixiera and Ismaily plus Argentine striker Facundo Ferreyra remained in France following a friendly against Lyon on Saturday.

Shakhtar's owner says the six players will be punished financially if they fail to return.

'If they don't come then in the first instance they will suffer,' the club's billionaire owner Rinat Akhmetov said in a statement on the Shakhtar website.

Meanwhile, Brazil winger Bernard, 
Shakhtar's most high-profile player who chose a move to Ukraine over a 
transfer to Arsenal last summer, is yet to rejoin the squad after his 
World Cup exploits in his native country.

It is not yet known whether the 21-year-old will join his compatriots in their refusal to return to the war-torn country.

Refusing to fulfil their contracts could cost the players 'tens of millions of euros' in compensation payments to the club, he warned.

'I don't rule out that these players will return to the club soon,' Akhmetov said, adding that several of them could arrive Monday and that the club would not seek to sell them.

By early afternoon, local authorities 
said the trains were running normally and the station had been only 
slightly damaged, but a Reuters witness could still hear shelling.

An electricity substation was partially destroyed and people with suitcases were leaving the area.

'It is dangerous near the railway station!' the Donetsk city council said in a statement on its website after the shooting began, asking residents in the area to stay indoors.

It said a nine-storey house had been damaged in the shelling and that transport had been halted in the area.

'In the morning there were explosions, people are extremely worried,' said a local resident who gave her name as Natalya.

Donetsk is central to the rebel uprising against rule by Kiev, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has vowed to retake the city as part of what Kiev calls its 'anti-terrorist operation' against the separatists.

He has, however, instructed the army not to fight within a 40 km (25 mile) diameter of the site where Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 came down on Thursday, killing all 298 people on board. But that does not cover Donetsk.

A statement from the headquarters of the 'anti-terrorist operation' said the army had taken control over a suburb of Donetsk and the president said soldiers were 'freeing' the village of Dzerzhinsk, about 60 km north of Donetsk.

Security Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko said work was under way around Donetsk on 'clearing approaches to the city, on destroying checkpoints of the terrorists.'

'If there are explosions in the middle of the city - then it is not Ukrainian soldiers,' he told a news conference.

'We have strict orders not to use air strikes and artillery in the city. If there is fighting in the city, we have information that there is a small self-organised group who are fighting with the terrorists.'

The pro-Western authorities in Kiev accuse the rebel fighters of shooting down the airliner. The separatists deny they are to blame.

Earlier on Monday, three members of a Dutch Disaster Victims Identification team arrived in Donetsk, hoping to check the remains of some of the victims of the plane crash. A team of Malaysian officials were also due to arrive on Monday.

The downing of the airliner has intensified calls for the fighting to end in eastern Ukraine and served as a reminder of the dangers the experts face working in a war zone.

International inspectors got access to the remains of hundreds of victims stored in refrigerated railway wagons near the crash site but governments expressed concern over broader access to the rebel-held area.

Against a background of international horror over the fate of the remains of the 298 victims of the Malaysia Airlines disaster, the first international investigators reached eastern Ukraine on Monday.

Three members of a Dutch disaster victims identification team arrived at a railway station near the crash site where rebels say 247 bodies have been stored in refrigerated wagons. About two thirds of the crash victims were Dutch.

The head of the team inspected the storage of the bodies in the rail cars and, despite an overwhelming stench of decomposition when the doors were opened, said it was fine.

'The storage of the bodies is of good quality,' said Peter van Vliet, whose team went through the wagons dressed in surgical masks and rubber gloves.

Van Vliet said he had been told the train would be leaving the station at Torez later on Monday so that bodies can be taken to where they can be identified and repatriated. He could not say where it was going.
