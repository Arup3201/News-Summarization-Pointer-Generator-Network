Bigger, bolder and faster. That is the premise behind Criterion's latest Need For Speed - a series known for it's blistering pace and, worryingly, it's frequent change of direction.

While Hot Pursuit thrived, offering car chases rarely bettered on the big screen, The Run was seen by some as a wrong turn.

On the run: Most Wanted has some of the best car chases ever seen in a game

But thankfully, Most Wanted puts the series firmly back on the road to success, with its intuitive gameplay, stunning visuals and refreshingly simple design.

You play an up-and-coming racer, tasked with trying to break into Fairhaven City's top ten Most Wanted drivers - each armed with their own exotic super car.

However, although the plot may be superficially shallow, what makes Most Wanted race ahead of the competition is just how much depth is on offer.

The game wastes no time in throwing you into the cockpit of a Porsche 911. You're instantly encouraged to drive around the city looking for races.

The racing mechanic generally works very well, capturing a sense of speed and urgency through finely-tuned gameplay and visuals.

AI is usually very aggressive, regardless of difficulty. Foes will ram you off the road, nudge you into on-coming traffic and cut you up at any chance.

It's a level of aggression not oft seen in racing games - resulting in many races quickly becoming revenge missions to take out the driver who just caused you to crash.

Hot wheels: Most of the cars on offer are some of the fastest on the planet

This helps enforce the personal significance and urgency of the task in hand, and stave off races feeling fragmented and not connected to the narrative.

Indeed, although the open world nature of Most Wanted clearly lends itself to be enjoyed more with human opponents, there's still plenty of fun to be had for those who predominantly play offline.

Upon completion of a race, you are awarded Speed Points to spend on your car. You can upgrade tyres, chassis, and gearing to name but a few tweaks.

These come in handy when dealing with the varied game modes on offer.

There are circuit races, unsurprisingly reminiscent of the Burnout games, while pursuits involve you trying to out run the police.

Of particular enjoyment are the Most Wanted races - where you tackle one of the game's strongest drivers in a one on one.

If successful, you'll be awarded their car - that is, after you run them off the road.

But perhaps Most Wanted's most impressive hand is the cars themselves. All are beautifully recreated, if deliberately overstated, beasts.

Duel: Races are similar to the Burnout games, featuring lots of takedowns 

Criterion hasn't just caught their aesthetic beauty, but have captured and exaggerated their distinct character and charm, too - every one boasting their own unique, boisterous exhaust notes and aggressive engine whines.

The result is a selection of cars that feel and handle very differently - adding a tactical element to what one to select for a specific race.

All, though, possess the trademark Criterion arcade-style under steer and drifting ability.

There are also some arcade elements in the game's structure to allow the player to concentrate on the racing.

For example, many of the best cars are hidden around the map and can be accessed immediately and are easily found. Simply drive up to them, press a button and you switch instantly.

This pick-up-and-play approach is echoed in fixing damage, too. Just drive through a garage and your car is magically fixed.

There is also the EasyDrive system which allow you to keep track of what races are available, tune your car and access online play via the Autolog. This lets you hop into multiplayer at any time.

Lose the cops: Fairhaven City is vast, and has plenty of backstreets to explore

Graphically, the game is stunning. In particular, damage models on the cars is frighteningly realistic.

There's a sense that you're driving an exotic vehicle, rather than some fairground dodge 'em that bounces off everything it touches.

Fairhaven City is a wonderful playground - its tall skyscrapers and sandy beaches provide the perfect backdrop to the carnage.

Sadly, the takedown camera - a staple in many-a-Criterion game has vanished.

Although crashes are stunningly realistic, often reducing cars to piles of twisted metal, they are all over too quickly.

Upon taking down an opponent, you have to look in the rear view mirror to see the result - rather than a slow-motion cinematic that served as a wonderful payoff in Hot Pursuit.

But bar this blip, Most Wanted is a frantic, adrenalin-soaked racing game that refuses to take its foot off the gas.
