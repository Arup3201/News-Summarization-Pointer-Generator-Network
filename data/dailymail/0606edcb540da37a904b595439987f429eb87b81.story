The number of people arrested for football-related disorder fell to a record low last season, figures revealed today.

A total of 3,089 English and Welsh fans were arrested at international and domestic games in 2010/11, down 302 from the previous season - the lowest level since records began in 1984/5.

There were no arrests at 70 per cent of games and 92 per cent of those whose football banning orders have expired since 2000 were assessed by police as no longer posing a risk of football disorder.

Good news: New figures have revealed that the number of people arrested for football-related disorder fell to a record low last season

The figures have been released in the same week that an England football supporter was jailed for three years for killing an innocent Wales fan outside Wembley Stadium in September.

1) Cardiff City - 143

2) Leeds United - 106

3) Chelsea - 105

4) Manchester United - 101

5) West Ham - 100

Crime Prevention Minister Lord Henley 
said: 'Football policing is a real British success story. Where 
hooliganism was once described as "the English disease", we now set an 
example for others to follow.'

The number of football banning orders in place in November also fell, down to 3,173 from 3,248 last year.

These
included 105 against Chelsea fans - 10 per cent of all the banning 
orders in the Premier League and the most of any team at that level - 
101 against Manchester United fans and 98 against Newcastle United fans.

In the Championship, Cardiff City fans topped the list with 143 banning orders - the most of any club in England and Wales - followed by Leeds United (106) and West Ham (100).

Fans of League Twoâ€™s Dagenham and Redbridge were the only group with no banning orders, the figures showed.

On Wednesday, England fan Ian Mytton, 41, was jailed for three years at the Old Bailey for killing a Wales football supporter.

Michael Dye, 44, died from head injuries inflicted by a single punch 
before a Euro 2012 qualifier between England and Wales at Wembley on September 6.

CCTV footage showed Mytton, of Redditch, Worcestershire, approaching Mr 
Dye on a concourse outside the stadium in North-West London before 
punching him once 25 minutes before the match kicked off and then 
walking away.

Mr Dye, from Ely in Cardiff, was taken to Northwick Park Hospital after 
suffering a fractured skull but died soon after his arrival.

Mytton had earlier pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

Following
the release of the new figures, The Association of Chief Police 
Officers (Acpo) warned that officers would continue to deal with those 
who seek to bring the game into disrepute.

Assistant
Chief Constable Andy Holt, the Acpo lead on football policing, said: 
'UK policing has led the way in dealing with football-related violence 
and disorder and the effectiveness of banning orders has drawn interest 
from police forces internationally as an effective method of reducing 
disorder at football matches.'
