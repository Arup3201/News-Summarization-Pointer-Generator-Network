Sex offenders in a small Minnesota town are trying to get elected into public office, despite not being allowed to visit city hall as they are ruled a danger to society.

The sex offenders are staging a write-in campaign to get elected to city council, and currently make up nearly 20 per cent of voters in Moose Lake, Minnesota.

Hundreds of men are civilly committed at the Moose Lake Sex Offender Treatment Program, as a court has ruled them ‘sexually dangerous’ to society after having served a prison sentence.

Campaign: Sex offenders at the Moose Lake Sex Offender Treatment Program in Minnesota are staging a write-in campaign to have representatives elected into public office

The sex offenders at the institution in Moose Lake currently make up 18.9 per cent of the registered voters in the town, a number which could increase.

At the moment, 925 of Moose Lake’s 2,700 eligible voters are registered, 175 of these at the institution.

However, at least 420 convicted rapists, paedophiles and other sex offenders at the treatment facility are eligible to vote, KARE-TV reports.

Sex offenders running for office are hoping to elect up to eight representaves in public office in an attempt to ‘improve’ rehabilitation and integration into society for the hundreds of men committed at The Moose Lake Sex Offender Treatment Program (MSOP).

The group, all civilly committed indefinitely due to their danger to society, are demanding the right to leave the MSOP without shackles and handcuffs and for Moose Lake to provide halfway houses.

One of the candidates, Kenny Daywitt, 32, from St Charles, Minnesota, was convicted of sexual assault 13 years ago and civilly committed after completing his prison sentence.

‘I'm definitely a person that has committed a sex offense, and I take full accountability for that. However, that's not the person who I am today,’ He told KARE-TV.

‘The people in town just think we're all monsters out here, and that's not true.’

Another candidate is Charles Stone, convicted 31 years ago for molesting two girls aged eight and nine.

Civil confinement sees a sex offender committed to a treatment programme or mental institution after they have served their prison sentence, if a court deems them to be a danger to society.

Civil commitment of a sex offender, determined by a court to be 'sexually dangerous' or have 'sexual psychopathic personalities',  is indefinite, and as a result, a de facto life sentence.

Minnesota has the most civilly committed sex offenders per capita in the U.S. and only two have been provisionally discharged from the program in the past 20 years.

However, he told a local newspaper, he is now 'rehabilitated' and wants increase the ability to take supervised trips outside the MSOP.

If the sex offenders are elected to local office, this will not change treatment rules at MSOP as it is run by the state of Minnesota, and not by Moose Lake.

As a result of the sex offenders’ campaign, other candidates in Moose Lake are stepping up their game.

‘I don’t think people here appreciate candidates with ulterior motives,’ Doug Juntunen, a Carlton County Sheriff’s deputy who is running for Moose Lake City Council, told Star Tribune.

‘And to me, the sex offenders clearly have an ulterior motive. They just want to be able to walk about [in Moose Lake] and aren’t looking out for the best interests of the city.’

Juntunen hopes that the write-in campaign as MSOP will drive up voters’ participation in Moose Lake, and effectively block the sex offenders’ chances of being elected, something which has happened in the past.
