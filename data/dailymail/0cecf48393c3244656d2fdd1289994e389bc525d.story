A woman allegedly subjected to a campaign of harassment by police after she split from her PC lover claimed yesterday that he threatened to ‘make her life hell’ when she filed a report against him.

Katie Bowman, who says her life was made a misery by Thames Valley Police officers, spoke out as the force finally admitted to disciplining ‘a number of officers’ following complaints by her.

Thames Valley Police refused to reveal how many officers were involved or comment on the nature of the disciplinary action.

Counter claim: PC Alexander Ash at his wedding in May

Miss Bowman, 24, a forensic science graduate, claims PC Alexander Ash instigated a relationship with her after texting her, having taken her number from a police report she filed about vandalism to her car.

She says that when she split from him after discovering he had a girlfriend, and reported him for obtaining her number from a statement, the alleged harassment by his colleagues began.

Miss Bowman said officers from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, stopped her more than 70 times for suspected offences including drink-driving and assault.

Complaint: Katie Bowman claims her life was made a misery

Despite never being convicted, Miss Bowman claims the officers filed a wealth of intelligence reports on her which have cost her three jobs after CRB checks.

PC Ash, of High Wycombe, who denies ever being in a relationship with Miss Bowman, claims it was she who pursued him and that disciplinary action taken against him related to drunken behaviour on a night out.

Miss Bowman claims the pair met in 2007 when she was 18 and lived in Marlow, and had gone into High Wycombe police station to report damage to her car.

‘Later that night he took my number off the statement paper and texted me his personal number and invited me out for a ride along with him,’ she said in a radio interview. ‘We started texting and it went from there really and we became together.’

She said that after ending the relationship she made a complaint to the professional standards department about how he first made contact with her.

‘He pulled me over one day and said, “I can make your life hell for doing this”,’ she claimed.

After this Miss Bowman, of Bedfordshire, who is now engaged and is pregnant with her first child, said she was breathalysed 70 times over two years – each with a negative result.

Of suggestions that she was a ‘teenage tearaway’ as portrayed in the police reports, Miss Bowman claimed: ‘A tearaway is someone who goes off the rails. I didn’t go off the rails. I made the mistake of going out with this copper.’

PC Ash, 31, who married recently, said the complaint from Miss Bowman only came after he refused to date her.

He claimed: ‘It is all rubbish. I 
never had a relationship with her and was with someone else at the time.
She contacted me first and would follow me and other officers around.

‘She was known in the area as bit of a troublemaker who had an obsession with the police.’

Miss Bowman has won the support of local MP Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, who has written to Chief Constable Sara Thornton branding the intelligence reports on her as ‘utterly trivial’.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: ‘Ms Bowman has made a number of complaints to Thames Valley Police, some of which were unsubstantiated and some resulted in disciplinary proceedings against officers.

‘In one case Ms Bowman made a complaint against a number of officers which she subsequently withdrew. Despite the fact she withdrew her complaint, Thames Valley Police continued with disciplinary proceedings against the officers.

‘The complaints made specifically about harassment were unsubstantiated. The papers were subsequently reviewed by the IPCC which agreed with the conclusion.’
