These chilling police mugshots were taken nearly a decade apart - but the arrogant scowl of the underworld kingpin they depict has not changed in that time.

The first picture, taken in 2003, shows Bradley Walsh aged just 19, soon after he helped beat a pub landlord to death during a botched robbery.

And the second dates from just four months ago, after Walsh, now 29, was caught with £160,000 worth of cocaine on him during a taxi ride.

The Salford gang boss has just started a seven-year prison sentence - and he is set to be questioned over the unsolved murder of a personal trainer who was shot dead in a bar in 2011.

Walsh is thought to have begun his criminal career after being recruited from an underworld 'job centre' in which unemployed youths volunteer to carry out robberies in return for drug money.

Along with three accomplices, he was jailed for eight and a half years in December 2003 for manslaughter and robbery over the death of pub owner Len Tague.

The 47-year-old was beaten to death with a fencepost while trying to stop the armed gang from stealing his takings.

Walsh served around four years in prison before his release in 2007.

He was arrested on suspicion of murder 
in September 2011 in relation to the death of gym worker Lee Erdman, 37,
who was shot dead at point-blank range during a late-night lock-in at a
pub in Salford.

Up to 30 drinkers witnessed the shooting, but even though a £50,000 reward was offered for information leading to the killer's conviction no one has been charged with the murder.

The pub's CCTV hard drive was stolen shortly after the killing and the murder weapon has not been recovered, while gangsters waged a graffiti campaign warning locals against speaking out.

Police complained about coming up against a 'wall of silence' during their investigation into the incident.

Walsh was not charged in relation to Mr Erdman's death, and was on bail in October last year when the taxi which was carrying him was stopped in Manchester city centre.

When police searched the cab, they found a large brick-shaped package wrapped in tape and stashed in a plastic bag.

The package contained 990 grams of cocaine, with a purity of 83 per cent and a street value of up to £160,000.

Text messages on Walsh's phone contained multiple references to the sale of drugs, while other messages consisted of threats to customers who were in debt to him.

Last week, he pleaded guilty to possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply at Manchester Crown Court.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Downey, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'The jailing of Walsh for more than seven years is an absolutely fantastic result.

'What this shows is that absolutely no one is untouchable. Criminals who terrorise communities with their drug dealing - which is often backed up with threats of violence - think they are above the law and cannot be caught. They could not be more wrong.

'I want to use this case to send a message to the people of Salford that we are constantly looking at different ways we can disrupt and dismantle members of organised crime groups who create a cycle of misery with their drug dealing and violent actions.

'What this result shows is that no one - regardless of their status within the criminal fraternity - can escape justice.'
