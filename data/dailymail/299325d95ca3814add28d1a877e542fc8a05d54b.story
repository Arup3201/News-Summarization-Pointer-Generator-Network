Snapchat is the latest tool being used by police officers to catch criminals across the Midlands.

West Midlands Police is the first force in the world to use the self-destructing messaging app to post community details, and appeals from departments including the cannabis Disposal Team and the Dogs Unit.

All the chats will be posted using the app's Stories feature, where they last for 24 hours rather than self-destructing after being read.

West Midlands Police has joined Snapchat under the username WestMidsPolice (pictured). The account will be used to inform residents of campaigns in areas including Walsall, Coventry and Wolverhampton. Departments including the cannabis Disposal Team, neighbourhood officers and the Dogs Unit will use the service

The force already uses Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr and Instagram to connect with the community, which includes Wallsall, Coventry, Birmingham and Wolverhampton.

Snapchat announced the Stories feature last October to its Android and iOS users.

It lets users add Snaps together to create a narrative.

When a Snap is added to a story, it is live for 24 hours before automatically disappearing.

This differs from regular Snaps that self-destruct after they're read, depending on what timeframe the user has chosen.

Privacy options can also be set for Snapchat Stories, which include Public or Friends.

Snapchat will be used in a similar way, and the force will post images and videos about events in the local area, campaigns its running, or to appeal for information about incidents and crime.

The force is using the app under the username WestMidsPolice, and said it will be sharing a number of images every day.

‘Part of this work is about connecting with younger people and helping them to feel they have a close connection with their local police force,' said Keiley Gartland, from the corporate communications department at the site.

'What we want is for them to have the confidence to give us a call or speak to their neighbourhood bobby when they really need our help - and social media is a great tool for us to do that.

'We can share crucial updates on incidents and crime prevention tips whilst also offering a unique insight into our work.’

The pictures will come from across departments that make up WMP such as the cannabis Disposal Team, Traffic Unit, CID, neighbourhood officers and the Dogs Unit.

Keiley added: ‘We’re primarily targeting a younger audience on Snapchat and it means when we really need to get an important message out to the community, we’ll have a captive audience.'

Officers of all ranks, from PC to Deputy Chief Constable, as well as police staff and special constables, now have a presence on social networking sites and earlier this year, the force’s Twitter account reached 100,000 followers.

West Midlands Police warned social media should not be used to report crime.
