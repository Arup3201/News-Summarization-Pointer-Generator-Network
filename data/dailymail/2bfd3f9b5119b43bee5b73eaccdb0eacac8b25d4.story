Max Chilton will race at this weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix following a U-turn by Marussia.

The team announced on Thursday that Chilton would be replaced by rookie American Alexander Rossi after a contractual dispute.

Chilton meanwhile, claimed he had voluntarily stepped aside so the team could sell his seat in a bid to raise 'much-needed funds'.

Rossi took part in the opening practice session for round 12 of the championship.

But it was later confirmed by Marussia that Chilton would be back in the car on Friday afternoon for the second practice session and for the remainder of the weekend. 

Marussia chief Graeme Lowdon said: ‘I can't go into too much detail on the individual instances but at the end of the day we are running an F1 team here.

‘There are a large number of commercial agreements that are involved and sometimes it just happens we reach a stage where for contractual reasons it's not appropriate for a driver to be in the car and we took that action.

‘These things happen. It's the drivers' jobs to be flexible. Both Max and Alex are professional drivers who will take this in their stride.

‘This is just a reflection of how the industry has to work sometimes.’

'Max Chilton has volunteered to step out of his race seat for this weekend's race in Spa, Belgium, to allow the team to attract much needed funds by selling his seat. Max will attend the race and be on hand to support the team in any way possible. Marussia are currently in talks with several new investors and it is expected the situation will be resolved before the next race in the F1 calendar in Monza.'
