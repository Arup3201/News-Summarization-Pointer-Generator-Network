Wal-mart Stores is pledging to hire every recently discharged veteran looking for a job, kick-starting one of the largest hiring commitments for U.S. veterans on record.

The both world's largest retailer and the nation's largest private employer says it expects to hire more than 100,000 veterans over the next five years thanks to the pledge, starting on Memorial Day.

The hiring pledge will cover veterans within 12 months of honorably leaving active duty. Most of the jobs will be in Wal-Mart's stores or its Sam's club locations. Some will be in the company's distribution centers.

With spirited support from the White House, specifically First Lady Michelle Obama, the pledge is set to be announced in New York on Tuesday as part of an address at the annual retail industry convention by Bill Simon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart's namesake U.S. business.

'Let's be clear; hiring a veteran can be one of the best decisions any of us can make,' says Mr Simon, according to prepared text supplied by the discounter.

'Veterans have a record of performance under pressure. They're quick learners, and they're team players. These are leaders with discipline, training, and a passion for service. There is a seriousness and sense of purpose that the military instills, and we need it today more than ever.'

Wal-Mart says it believes it is already the largest private employer of veterans in the country.

The company says that it has spoken to the White House about its commitment, and said Mrs Obama's team has already expressed an interest in working with Wal-Mart and with the rest of the business community.

Calling Wal-Mart’s announcement ‘historic,’ Mrs Obama has herself spearheaded a White House drive to encourage businesses to hire veterans.

'We all believe that no one who serves our country should have to fight for a job once they return home,' Mrs Obama said in her statement. 'Wal-Mart is setting a ground-breaking example for the private sector to follow.'

In the next several weeks, the White House will convene the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and major U.S. employers to encourage businesses to make significant commitments to train and employ American's returning veterans, according to Simon's prepared text.

Wal-Mart which also operates Sam's Clubs, employs more than 1.4 million workers in the U.S.

Of that number about 100,000 are already veterans, a spokesman told CNN.
