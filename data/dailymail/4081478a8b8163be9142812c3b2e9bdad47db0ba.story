A tatty flat which only has 12 years left on its lease and needs a full refurbishment has been put up for sale - for almost £2million.

The two-bedroom flat is on the south-west corner of Mayfair's Grosvenor Square, the most expensive square in London.

It boasts two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, reception room, guest cloakroom and balcony - but is in desperate need of a full refurbishment which would cost around £1.5million.

Tatty: It doesn't look like a £2million flat - but this living room is in Grosvenor Square, London's priciest

Who would live in a flat like this? The property is decorated in pale blue and the bathroom needs serious work

Location, location, location: Estate agents say the 'ultra-prime' flat could be brought up to scratch for £5m

Anyone interested in buying the 1950s property would also need to spend around £2.7million extending the lease to 90 years.

Despite this, the flat - which measures 1,528 sq/ft - is still being offered with an asking price of 'just' £1.95 million.

Big plans: A blueprint of the property

This is more than ten times the average £167,000 price paid for a home in England and Wales last month.

The buyer would also have to pay a £50 annual ground rent and £16,767 service charge for the flat, which has a 24-hour porter and underground car parking space.

Upmarket estate agents Knight Frank and Wetherell are advising on the flat - and say they have been inundated with interest.

The flat is above a restaurant owned 
by the billionaire businessman Richard Caring's and near some of the 
world's most expensive homes and opulent embassies.

Estate
 agent Peter Wetherell said: 'This flat in Grosvenor Square is priced at
 just £1.95million which is well below the average for Mayfair and 
reflects the short lease.

'However
 for the adroit investor, there is the potential for substantial capital
 value uplift and profit once the apartment is transformed into an 
ultra-prime residence.

'For
 an outlay of up to £5million the apartment could be transformed into a 
highly desirable ultra-prime residence on a long lease.'

Leafy: The square is the most expensive to buy property on in central London, where the market is booming

Entrance: The hallway of the building, which bills residents a service charge of almost £17,000 a year

House prices in Britain have risen 9.4 per cent in the last year, according to latest figures, fuelling fears of a housing bubble.

London has been affected far more, with prices surging almost 15 per cent.

Experts have warned the capital's market is being squeezed by a rush towards luxurious towers and flats which cater to the super-rich.

Last summer an estate agents' network, London Property Partners, revealed it had sold 85 per cent of its homes in the previous year to overseas buyers as others were priced out of the market.
