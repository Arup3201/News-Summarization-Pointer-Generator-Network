A  girl who wrote to DC Comics after she was fed up of the misogynistic nature of her favourite comic books was delighted when the company transformed her into her very own hero.

Rowan Hansen, 11, from Illinois, wrote a letter to the comic giants at the beginning of February expressing her annoyance with the lack of  female characters in the superhero strips.

In it she called for more female characters and action figures and even pointed out that their rival Marvel comics were outdoing them in gender equality.

In the letter Rowan wrote: 'I'm upset because there aren't very many girl superheroes or movies and comics from DC.

'There are Superman and Batman movies but not a Wonder Woman one. You have a Flash TV show but not a Wonder Woman one.

'Marvel comic made a movie about Talking Tree and Racoon Awesome but you haven't made a movie with Wonder Woman.'

Rowan went on to say that she was not alone and there are many other female readers of DC comics.

In her letter she tells DC that 'girls read comics too and they care', it received thousands of shares on Twitter

'I love your comics, but I would love them a lot more if there were more girls.

'I asked a lot of the people I know whether they watched movies or read books or comics where girls were the main characters, they all said yes. 

'Please do something about this. Girls read comics too and they care.' 

Her letter received thousands of shares on Twitter after Jim Hansen, Rowan's father posted it online.

A disgruntled Rowan was therefore delighted when she received a reply later in the month from DC Comics who tweeted saying they are 'working hard to create more superhero fun for girls'.

DC also tweeted to say that they agreed with Rowan and that more girls should read comics.

To prove they were true to their word the company released a bespoke image of Rowan reimagined as her very own superhero complete with a costume and cape. 

The comic book super fan told Today says she could never get her head around the gender inequality in the superhero world. 

'I have never really understood why they've had more male superheroes.

'It's not like the male superheroes are better than the female superheroes, there are just more of them.' 

Although Rowan was thrilled with her response she says that she will not cease to campaign for more female characters. 

She told Today: 'It was really, really cool. But I don't want people to think, "Oh, yeah, okay, they responded to her. Now it's over." I want people to keep trying to make this happen, because it's really important to me.'
