AWOL: U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Russell Matthews admitted to desertion, saying he spent three months camping in the mountains of Oahu and didn't plan on ever returning to his job

A Coast Guard rescue swimmer whose disappearance led to a large-scale search in Hawaii pleaded guilty to desertion Tuesday, saying he left work one day, decided never to return and spent the next three months camping in the mountains of Oahu.

Petty Officer 1st Class Russell Matthews pleaded guilty to desertion and wrongful use of marijuana during a special court-martial in Honolulu on Tuesday before a Coast Guard judge.

In exchange for his guilty plea, the Coast Guard dismissed charges of being absent without leave and causing the Coast Guard to conduct a search when there was no need.

‘Your honor, I left work and I didn't have any intention of going back,’ he testified, describing how he went to pick up his children from school on October 25 and then got into argument with his wife.

He then drove to Kaena Point, a remote part of Oahu, and walked on the beach for several hours. Afterward, he camped in the mountains behind his kids' school, he said, where he stayed until he showed up at his wife's home in mid-January.

‘That's a long time to be camping,’ said Coast Guard Cmdr. Kevin Bruen, the judge presiding over the court-martial. ‘How did you sustain yourself?’

‘I had $20 in my pocket,’ Matthews said softly, seated at the defense table, flanked by his appointed Navy lawyers and wearing his service dress blues. ‘I did some... stuff I try not to remember.’

Members of the Coast Guard who participated in the search that scoured more than 10,000 square miles testified about the motivation to find one of their own, the speculation he may have tried to kill himself and then the mixed emotions that came when he turned up alive.

Pilots flew 64 hours scouring the waters off Kaena Point, taking Coast Guard members away from their normal duties and taxing aircraft.

‘He's part of our unit...we are 
family,’ said Cmdr. Prince Neal. Rescuers mourned his loss, only to find
out he was alive. They felt happiness for his children, but also 
confusion, Neal recalled.

Lt. j.g. Curtis Gookin recalled 
searching for four days through rough ocean conditions, holding out hope
they could recover his body and bring some solace to his family.

When he surfaced months later, ‘I was really disgusted by his actions,’ he said.

Robert Coster, a civilian 
search-and-rescue coordinator, testified that the estimated cost of the 
search for the Coast Guard was more than $1million.

The scenario Coster thought of during
the search was that a well-trained rescue swimmer went into the ocean 
to commit suicide, changed his mind and was fighting the ocean to 
survive.

‘This was an individual who was well-trained by the Coast Guard,’ Coster said. ‘He understood what we were doing for him.’

Matthews didn't discuss more about 
his time in the wilderness, only saying he simply went back to where he 
lived and realized his wife and children had moved.

The memories of what happened next 
are sketchy, he said, recalling that paramedics were called because he 
had a cut on his head and he ended up in police custody.

He admitted smoking marijuana in 
September and smoking several times during his desertion. ‘I smoked it 
in a joint, your honor,’ he testified. ‘Probably a few times, your 
honor.’

Tragedy: Clara and her children were involved in a head-on bicycling accident in 2009 and the mother suffered a traumatic brain injury; two years later, she committed suicide

Matthews' mother testified via telephone from the mainland that she was told he drowned, but she didn't believe it.

‘He would never do that to his 
children,’ Carol Matthews said. ‘I told them at the time I believed my 
son was AWOL.’ She said she told the Coast Guard he was likely in Puerto
Rico or in the caves of Pupukea, on the north shore of Oahu.

Hawaii News Now previously reported that Matthews lost four colleagues in a 2008 helicopter crash.

The following year, his first wife 
was critically hurt when she was hit head-on by a car while riding her 
bike. She died a couple of years later, according to public records.

Coast Guard attorneys prosecuting the case said his two sons are in the custody of his first wife's sister on the mainland.

Matthews was in the process of being 
discharged from the Coast Guard for illegal use of marijuana when he 
disappeared in October.

The 36-year-old showed up at his home in mid-January.

Police said Matthews was incoherent when he was found, and he taken to a hospital for observation.

The
Coast Guard later took him into custody and had him confined at a Navy 
brig while they investigated why he left without authorization.

Police
had found Matthews' car abandoned at Kaena Point, a remote area of Oahu
next to the ocean, after his wife reported him missing.

Treatment: The petty officer is now being evaluated at Tripler Army Medical Center

Police at the time described him as 
emotionally distraught after losing his ex-wife and colleagues, and said
his friends and family were concerned for his welfare.

'In Petty Officer Matthews' case, we 
certainly empathize with his situation, but we certainly do not condone 
his actions,' Chief Warrant Officer Gene Maestas said last month.

Search and rescue crews scoured more than 10,000 square miles looking for Matthews.

Honolulu firefighters sent a helicopter and rescue teams to searches the rugged coastline and sand dunes near Kaena Point.

Matthews joined the Coast Guard in 1997. He's been stationed at Air Station Barbers Point on Oahu for five years.
