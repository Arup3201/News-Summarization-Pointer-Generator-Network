Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe is to speak to Derby County about a potential loan deal on Wednesday.

Ibe, 18, will leave Anfield for the season but Daniel Agger and Jack Robinson are expected to make permanent moves.

QPR are discussing a £1million deal with Liverpool for defender Robinson with Rangers likely to loan him out once he joins.

Daniel Agger is also looking to leave. The Dane has fallen down the pecking order following the arrival of Dejan Lovren. 

Agger said: 'The future is complicated. There are a few things that have to be sorted and we have to take it from there.

'I actually don’t know what will happen. It is a bit up to Liverpool. I have had niggling injuries at the wrong times and I have to say that it is difficult to change the team when it is winning. 

'I am not frustrated by that. I am frustrated the way it happened and the way it was handled.' 

Key man: Agger has been an important defender for Liverpool in the past but is no longer first choice

Wanted: Harry Redknapp is prepared to pay around £1million to bring Jack Robinson to Loftus Road
