Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez and Angel di Maria were among the Argentina players who trained at Manchester City's training ground on Monday ahead of their side's friendly match against Portugal.

Manchester United star Di Maria trained on enemy territory ahead of his Argentina's encounter at his home stadium.

Tevez, who has been recalled to Argentina's national team set up after missing the 2014 World Cup, trained at his former side's ground ahead of his return to Old Trafford.

Former Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano and Tottenham winger Erik Lamela were also put through their paces by Argentina's coaching staff.

Argentina will be hoping they can follow up their recent 2-1 win over Croatia on English soil when they take on Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal.

Former Barcelona boss Gerardo Martino has seen his side win three out of a possible four matches since taking over the reins from Alejandro Sabella.

And, of course, all eyes will be on the latest installment of Messi vs Ronaldo, who have been in opposition 27 times before.

The Argentine's side has been victorious 12 times and Ronaldo's seven.
