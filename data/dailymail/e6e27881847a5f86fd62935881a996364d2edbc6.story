Super tax: Lib Dem president Tim Farron has called for a tier structure for its flagship mansion tax policy

Britain’s most expensive homes should 
be hit with a ‘super mansion tax’ to help raise billions in tax 
revenues, according to a senior Liberal Democrat.

The
party already advocates a 1 per cent tax on homes worth more than 
£2million, but party president Tim Farron said those worth more should 
face an even higher rate.

He
said yesterday: ‘You could have various rates within the mansion tax. A
£4million property, for example, paying a higher rate.’

A
tax on expensive properties is also backed by the Labour Party, 
suggesting it could become a reality if the two parties form a coalition
after the next general election.

Mr Farron told the Evening Standard he wanted
to charge people who had properties and wealth at much more than 
£2million 'a higher proportion' instead of lowering the threshold to 
catch more properties.

He
said: 'I do take the point that in London there are many homes that are
worth a significant amount of money which would be seen as not 
exorbitantly luxurious properties.

'It’s important that taxation should be progressive.

’You
could have various rates within the mansion tax - a property worth 
£4million, for example, paying at a higher rate, as well as a higher 
global sum, than those with smaller properties.

’There is a way of doing this without damaging people who are potentially in a more marginal position.'

Mr
Farron’s proposal comes just days after Knight Frank, the estate agent,
warned that under the current plans the Lib Dems will fall short of 
raising their target of £1.7billion a year from the mansion tax.

Its research suggested the levy would need to be extended to all homes worth more than £1.25million.

A
mansion tax would be levied overwhelmingly on London and the South 
East, where eight out of ten £2million-plus homes are located.

Near the capital: This four-bedroom detached home in St Albans is on the market for £1.35million, enough for the mansion tax if it was reduced to £1.25million.

The
plans are also opposed by the Conservatives, which believe that while 
the  initial threshold of any mansion tax would  be set very high, it 
would be progressively brought down until eventually it hits ‘ordinary 
family homes’.

Grant 
Shapps, the Conservative Party chairman, said: ‘Families who live in 
suburbs [will] discover they are living in mansions, not ordinary homes.

'They start off 
calling it a mansion tax but [it] will gradually bear down on 
hard-working families as the threshold comes down further.’

The Lib-Dems unveiled their original 
mansion tax policy in 2009 but were quickly forced to raise the 
threshold from £1million to £2million amid concerns about the number of 
homeowners who would be affected, particularly in London.

█ Nick Clegg’s fiercest Liberal Democrat critic has said he should be 
ousted because his personal ratings are as bad as Labour’s least 
successful leader, Michael Foot.

As party members gather for the 
start of their annual conference in Glasgow tomorrow, Lord Oakeshott, 
who warned that the Lib Dems could be reduced to just 20 seats at the 
next general election, added: ‘It’s nothing personal, you’ve got to look
at the facts.’
