Paedophile Rolf Harris could be earning as much as £1,300 a day from his prison cell thanks to his shrewd investments, it is claimed. 

Harris was jailed for five years and nine months last July for sex attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986.  

But while fellow inmates at his Category C Stafford prison earn no more than £7 a day performing chores, the disgraced 84-year-old is making a fortune.

‘He is a convicted paedophile and yet he is ­making a large sum of money,’ a source close to his finances told the Sunday People.

‘All he has to do is sit in his cell and his fortune grows.’

Harris invested much of his multi-million pound earnings from his long-running career as a TV star, musician and artist.

At the time of his sentencing, his companies were worth £8.5million, the Sunday People reported.

New figures suggest his earnings have shot by £290,000, according to the newspaper.

Harris also owns a home on the River Thames and his total assets could be worth more than £15million.

He also earns interest on £2.3million in cash and the stock-market value of £6.2million of shares owned by his firms continues to rise.

‘It won’t go down too well that they are having to work to earn a few pounds when he is getting ­richer by doing nothing’ a jail source told the Sunday People.

Harris is one of many celebrities jailed for historic sex crimes in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Most recently, TV weatherman Fred Talbot was convicted of a string of offences after jurors heard how he coerced young boys into simulating naked orgies on school trips in the 1970s and 80s.

Former glam rock singer Gary Glitter was found guilty of carrying out a string of sex attacks on young girls while at the height of his fame.

He was found guilty of of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13. 

Former PR guru Max Clifford, former presenter Stuart Hall and  former BBC radio presenter Chris Denning have all been jailed following trials brought under Operation Yewtree.
