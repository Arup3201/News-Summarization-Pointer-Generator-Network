The state pension age should rise to 70 by 2040, Britain's pension tsar said last night (library image)

The state pension age should rise to 70 by 2040 – more than 20 years earlier than scheduled under government changes, the country’s pension tsar said last night.

At present, a woman can claim her State pension at the age of 62 while men receive theirs from the age of 65.

Ministers have already outlined plans to first align and then increase the ages at which men and women become eligible for the pension - but Lord Turner said the current timetable should be speeded up even more dramatically.

Under the current plan, the State pension age for women will match men at 65 by 2018, and then both men and women will rise to 66 by 2020, 67 by 2028, 68 by the ‘mid-2030s’ and 69 by the ‘late-2040s’.

As the State pension age is increased with life expectancy in the future, experts say the Government’s rules indicate it will reach 70 by around 2063.

Speaking in London last night, former UK Pensions Commission chairman Lord Adair Turner said: ‘I think 70 by 2040 would be a good thing to aim for.’

Lord Turner, who was hired by the Labour government to solve the country’s pensions crisis, also said there is a case for workers to be forced to save into a pension.

Under the current rules, all bosses must pay into a pension for their workers - but workers can ‘opt out’ of the scheme, deciding for whatever reason that they do not want to save.

At the event, organised by the think-tank, Policy Exchange [must keep], the ex-chairman of the Financial Services Authority said: ‘There is a case for compulsion.’ Lord Turner urged people to accept that working later in life is often a good, not a bad, thing.

He said: ‘For most people, leaving the workforce too early in life is a bad idea. People need the social interaction of work.’ He added that he believes ‘60 is the new 40.’ On the prospect of forcing people to save into a pension, he said it was simply not possible to do unless rip-off pension charges are scrapped.While describing himself as ‘open-minded’ about compulsion, he added: ‘We cannot compel people to save and then start taking money off them.

‘I don’t think it is OK to compel people to save and then there being any danger of them paying one per cent fees. You’ve got to get it lower than that.’ The increasing State pension age represents one of the most dramatic social changes in Britain, with millions of people set to work longer than their parents or grandparents.

For many women, they saw their mother stop work and start claiming her State pension at 60 while they will have to wait a decade longer.

David Robbins, a senior consultant at the pension advisers Towers Watson, said: ‘Making people wait an extra two years to claim saves about £15,000 per person, as well as generating more tax revenue if they work longer in response.

‘Whether that’s better or worse than cutting the weekly amount [of State pension] depends on how long you live for.’ Last night, a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘We are making the State pension more sustainable for the future.

‘This government had already outlined increases to 68 and have built a mechanism for future reviews which will take account of life expectancy and other factors.’
