Cyclists have criticised a new bike lane - for being just 13 feet long.

The cycle lane was painted in Beetwell Street in Chesterfield earlier this month.

But it has already been slammed by the town's cycling community, some of whom have branded it an 'embarrassment'.

Cycle path: Residents have slammed a new cycle path which they say is far too small. They claim the cycle path measures just 13 feet

A bit short! The cycle path in Chesterfield covers just 13 feet, meaning the cyclist has to cycle off the path almost as soon as they have cycled on

Measuring 13 feet, it means the cyclist has to cycle off the path almost immediately after they have got on.

Bike commuter Will Jones, 22, said: 'It makes the council a laughing stock really.

'Why on earth would anybody need a cycle lane so short? It's stupid.'

Derbyshire County Council, which is in charge of highways for the area, has defended the path.

It says the section photographed is part of a larger cycle lane, separated by junctions.

But cyclist Lisa Jennings, 36, said: 'It's an embarrassment to the town.

The cycle lane was painted in Beetwell Street, Chesterfield, by Derbyshire County Council earlier this month. Many cyclists in the town have criticised the new path, saying there are plenty of other places where paths could have been created

One bike commuter Will Jones, 22, said it made the council look like a 'laughing stock' while another said the council needed to get its priorities straight

'There are so many dangerous roads which really do need a cycle lane, but don't.

'So to paint this pathetic little lane is just an insult to cyclist who are forced to use genuinely dangerous roads which still don't have a cycle lane.

'The council needs to get its priorities straight.'

A spokesman for Derbyshire County Council told MailOnline: 'This is not a four-metre long cycle path - it is part of our Chesterfield town-wide network.

'The photograph makes it look odd because it is a busy part of town and it is intersected by two road junctions.

'We’re keen to promote cycling and make our towns accessible to cyclists. This cycle path is a continuation of a longer cycle path from the A61 Derby Road, through the picturesque Queen’s Park into the town centre.'

A spokesman for Derbyshire County Council said the 13 feet cycle path was not the complete cycle lane
