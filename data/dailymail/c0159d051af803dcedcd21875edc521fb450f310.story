President Barack Obama has a veto pen, and he will use it to block GOP-passed legislation if necessary, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Thursday. 

But, Earnest, said, Obama would rather work with Republicans instead of against them.

'So if that means another round of golf with Speaker [John] Boehner....then he's willing to do that. If it means sittin' down at the table and enjoying some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell, if that's going to advance our ability to find common ground among' he said, then Obama's willing to do that, too.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama would rather work with Republicans instead of against them. 'So if that means another round of golf with Speaker [John] Boehner....then he's willing to do that. If it means sittin' down at the table and enjoying some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell' then Obama's willing to do that, too.

Earnest's suggestion that Obama may bond with McConnell over bourbon was in reference to a comment the president made on Wednesday during press conference. 

In response to a question from a reporter, Obama said he 'would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon' with the Republican leader as a show of good faith.

The joke harkens back to the 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner. At the annul roast Obama told the audience, in jest, 'Why don’t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell!'

The dis was in response to critics of the president who had said he he needed to extend a hand across the aisle to the opposition.

McConnell responded to the jab by posting a picture of himself with a beer at a bar sitting next to an empty chair and a glass of red wine. 

At yesterday's presser, in which Obama addressed the GOP gains in the House and Senate, ABC News' Jon Karl reminded the president of the dig, at which point Obama said he'd welcome a drink with McConnell.

'I don’t know what his preferred drink is,' Obama said to laughter, adding that McConnell 'has always been very straightforward' with him.

'To his credit, he has never made a promise that he couldn’t deliver,' Obama admitted. 'And he knows the legislative process well. He obviously knows his caucus well -- he has always given me, I think, realistic assessments of what he can get through his caucus and what he can’t. 

'And so I think we can have a productive relationship.'

Obama seemed open on Wednesday to engaging the GOP leaders through less combative means than has typically been employed by both political parties since Republicans took control of the House in 2011.

'If the ways that we’re approaching the Republicans in Congress isn’t working, I’m going to try different things - whether it’s having a drink with Mitch McConnell or letting John Boehner beat me again at golf, or weekly press conferences,' he said.

'I don’t know if that would be effective,' he added amid laughter from the press corp. 

Since Obama's press conference yesterday McConnell and Boehner came out with a list of Republican sponsored legislation they'd like to see approved by Congress and sent to the president's desk next year. Among those were bills that would gut Obamacare, the president's legacy-making law. 

When Republicans take a majority of both chambers beginning in January they will have enough votes to pass legislation repealing the health care reform act, forcing Obama to wet his ink straight out of the gate.

'The president does have a pen on his desk. I’m confident that he’ll be in a position, where he’ll have to veto some legislation where Democrats and Republicans are not able to find some common ground,' Earnest warned on Thursday in an interview on MSNBC show Morning Joe.

'The president's eager, however, to actually sign pieces of legislation that have strong bipartisan support.'

In an interview at Fox News on Thursday morning Earnest said the president is fully aware that he and Republican leadership are not 'gonna to agree on everything.'

'There are things that the president's gonna do that Republicans won't agree with. There are bills that Republicans are gonna pass that the president doesn't agree with,' he said.

'The question really is, are we gonna to focus on the disagreements, or are we gonna to focus on those areas' where Republicans and Democrats can work together. 

Policy disagreements are no 'excuse' not to work together to make the country better, Earnest told reporters during his daily briefing on Thursday. 

Finding middle ground will be the  'focal point' of the White House in the weeks and months ahead and the topic of 'ongoing' conversations with Capitol Hill leaders, starting with a bipartisan luncheon at the White House tomorrow, he on Thursday.

Playfully asked on MSNBC if McConnell and Obama would finally grab that bourbon together during tomorrow's meeting, Earnest said, 'I think tomorrow will be focused on business. I don't know that there will be a lot of drinking.'

At the meeting Obama and congressional leadership will also discuss a request the president put forward for additional funding to fight Ebola. Earnest said on Thursday.

If the president and McConnell do 'share a glass of bourbon,' he said, it will be in a private setting, not a public one, like tomorrow's meeting. 

Earnest told ABC reporter Jon Karl today that a date has not been set for the get-together 'but stay tuned.'

'I think the fact of the matter is the president is interested in trying to build some relationships with members of Congress to try to advance some of these priorities,' Earnest said Thursday morning when he was asked about the anticipated bourbon summit while on Fox.

Let's be clear, though, he said, voters 'aren't just looking for the president to sit down and have a drink with Mitch McConnell and play a round of golf with Speaker Boehner.They actually want results.

'And if there are things that the president can do differently, he said, to make sure that we're getting results for middle class families for the American people, then he's willing to change his tactics to do exactly that,' Earnest said. 

At his briefing today with reporters Earnest struck a similar tone. It's not as if 'an extra cocktail party or another round of golf would have substantially changed the outcome' of the last few years, he said.

'But what will substantially change the outcome is a re-dedication on the part of this administration' to work with Republicans, he said, and 'a different political calculation' by the GOP that would make them more inclined to work with the president to put into law legislation that both sides agree on.

Obama said Wednesday he'd have a drink with McConnell if the GOP leader wanted to; joke goes back to jab Obama made at the senator in 2013
