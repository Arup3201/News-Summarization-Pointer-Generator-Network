In his younger days, pensioner Michael Mather was used to sparring in the ring with boxing legend Henry Cooper.

But more recently he has dusted off his fighting skills to put up a fight against two brutal thugs who attacked him outside his home in Ilford, Essex.

The 77-year-old was hit on the head with a wooden club as they tried to force their way into his house while he loaded his car.

Proving he can still throw a good punch, Mr Mather hit one of them in the face and the pair, in their late teens, fled the scene.

Mr Mather spent his youth training with post-war heavyweight boxing icon Henry Cooper and East End gangsters, the Kray twins.

Mr Mather said: 'One of the boys walloped me on the head with a two foot log and it started bleeding. I was so angry I swore at them and told them I was going to kill them.

'They then tried to push past me to get into the house.

'I went to hit one of the boys in the solar plexus with my left and then with my right hand hit him on the nose and it just burst which I do feel a bit guilty about.'

Mr Mather was on his way to referee a local football tournament when he was confronted by his attackers.

'I was putting my ref's gear into the car and I didn't really notice the boys,' he said. 'I heard a voice saying "can I use your toilet mister?" but I told them it was out of order,' he said.

They thugs insisted that Mr Mather let them into his house and attacked him from behind after he turned his back.

'After I hit him the boys ran off,' he added.

'I assume it was the sight of me with blood over my face which was so thick I couldn't see through my glasses.'

He was then taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford.

He said: 'When the nurse at the hospital was stitching my head back together all I could think about was getting to the football match as I didn't want to let the boys down.

'I want to warn people so that this sort of thing doesn't happen to anyone else.'

He also said he spent time sparring with East End gangsters, the Kray twins, pictured above
