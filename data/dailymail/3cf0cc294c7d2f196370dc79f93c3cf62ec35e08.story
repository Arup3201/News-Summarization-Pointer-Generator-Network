Claims: A Tory MP and his wife have been accused of groping their housekeeper while asking for a threesome (stock picture)

A TORY MP and his wife lured their lesbian housekeeper from the servants’ quarters and tried to engage her in a threesome, a tribunal heard.

The couple, known only as Mr and Mrs P, allegedly groped the middle-aged woman and tried to perform a sex act on her as they sat drinking wine on a warm summer’s evening.

The pair giggled as their ‘humiliated and scared’ employee fled from their advances and barricaded herself in her bedroom, the employment tribunal heard.

A few weeks after the alleged assault the woman was abruptly told to leave the house, she alleged.

The MP gave her £300 cash and a letter claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and that a  severance deal would be drawn up, the hearing was told.

The South Coast tribunal heard the housekeeper was invited to live in the MP’s house as a ‘guest’ in the spring of 2012 after breaking up with her civil partner.

She said in August last year she was in the staff kitchen when Mrs P invited her to join her and her husband in their sitting room, which she reluctantly agreed to.

She told the tribunal that as she sat on the sofa the MP came and sat close to her. She said: ‘Mrs P then came and sat on the floor between his legs.

'I felt very uncomfortable with Mr P sitting so close to me and opted to sit on the edge of the sofa.

‘Following a short conversation, Mrs P placed her drink on a tray and began to French kiss Mr P who was sat next to me.

‘I was extremely embarrassed and looked away… as I really did not know what to do. I hoped they would soon stop.

‘Instead, I felt a hand touch me in my crotch… I was wearing jeans.

Houses of Parliament: The housekeeper is claiming for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal after the Tory MP allegedly told her weeks after the alleged assault that she had an hour to leave the house

‘I was extremely shocked and jumped at
 the feel of the hand and saw it was Mrs P’s hand. I shot back into the 
back of the sofa and as soon as I’d done this, Mr P then proceeded to 
place his hand on the top of my thigh.

‘I was very shocked and scared by what
 was happening and shot to my feet. I said, “I’m sorry, I’m not into 
this sort of thing” and I quickly left the room.’

She continued: ‘As I left, I could 
hear Mrs P giggling. They both clearly thought it very funny but I was 
extremely upset and scared and went directly into my room and I 
barricaded my door.’

The MP in the tribunal yesterday denied he would ‘pop out naked’ around his home in front of the housekeeper.

Mr P described himself as a ‘courteous gentleman’ who would never behave that way.

His assertion came after his housekeeper told the hearing he would often appear about the house without clothes.

She said: ‘This happened on a number of times to the extent I did not think it could possibly be accidental.’

She said she spoke to Mrs P about it, but she was ‘dismissive’ and Mr P continued to appear naked in front of her.

She added: ‘I’d be extremely embarrassed and would apologise for being there and would walk away immediately.’

The housekeeper claimed Mrs P would also often undress in her presence when she was cleaning the bedrooms.

But Mr P told the tribunal: ‘I have never behaved like that in front of anyone… I would never come out of the shower naked. I would always have a towel around my waist if I was not wearing shorts or such like.

‘I did not just pop out naked in front of her.’

He also told the hearing that he understood that the housekeeper liked to sunbathe naked.

Her bosses went on holiday early the 
day after the alleged incident and when she next saw Mrs P over a 
fortnight later she asked to see her alone in the kitchen.

The housekeeper told the hearing: ‘She
 said she did not wish to talk about what had happened and asked me not 
to speak to anyone else about the incident.

‘She also asked that I did not “let 
her down”. I assumed by this request that if I did not speak of the 
incident again, then my position would be safe.’

She continued: ‘Mrs P did not ask me 
how I was feeling about the incident or indeed make any apology or 
attempt to remedy the situation.’ But a few weeks after the alleged 
assault, the housekeeper claims Mr P told her she had an hour to leave, 
citing a series of  fallings out that she had had with other members of 
their staff, the tribunal heard.

She said he gave her £300 and a 
letter falsely claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and 
that a severance deal would be drawn up.

The housekeeper also claimed she was 
offered £5,000 to ‘waive her right’ to take the matter to an employment 
tribunal, which she says she declined.

She is claiming sexual 
discrimination, unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal. She told the 
tribunal: ‘The harassment and dismissal from my position and my eviction
 have caused me significant problems including distress, anxiety and 
depression.

I felt considerably low and considered suicide as life did not seem worth living.’

The MP and his wife strenuously denied
 the allegations, calling them ‘wholly untrue and ridiculous’ and 
accusing the woman of attempting to extort money from them.

Mr P said: ‘It is a complete 
fabrication from start to finish. I can never remember asking the 
claimant into our TV room, sitting down with her, or having a drink with
 her.’

He added: ‘My wife would never behave in that manner.’  

The hearing continues.
