A massive search is underway for a 21-year-old college student who vanished on a spring break trip to Panama City, Florida.

Reny Jose, a student at Rice University in Texas, was last seen by his friends at 7pm on Monday. On Tuesday morning, the friends contacted the Bay County Sheriff's Office to report him missing.

A 22-year-old friend told investigating officers that Jose had taken LSD 
and had spoken about harming himself, according to a report from the 
sheriff's office, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Clothes and other items belonging to Jose, including his cell phone, were found in a garbage can near to the home they were renting, police said.

His friends said they had seen him wearing those clothes before he went missing.

Deputies and a sheriff's office air unit have been searching the area near to the rental home as well as 
nearby beaches, and his family has flown there to assist the search.

Authorities have also contacted hospitals and taxi services in the areas, as well as a neighboring police department in the hope that someone will see the missing man.

Bay County Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer Corley Ruth said that they were perplexed by the disappearance, but did not suspect foul play.

'We have no idea where he is,' she said, adding that people were staying away from the water.

'Nobody's going into that water, it's not even begun to warm up yet.'

His family have set up a Facebook page to spread the word about his disappearance and his sister, Reshma Jose, wrote on her page that her family was heading to Florida.

'My family and I are so thankful for all
 your prayers and support. We are headed to Panama City Beach to 
continue the search and we will do our best to keep everyone updated,' 
she wrote.

Search: An air and land search is underway for Jose, who is believed to have taken drugs before he vanished

Jose is a mechanical engineering major and a member of Martel College at Rice University. On Tuesday, university officials issued a letter to students and staff to tell them of the disappearance.

He arrived in Panama City with the group on Saturday. The rest of the group said they are cutting the trip short and heading home.

Officials ask anyone with information to call the Bay County Sheriff's office at (850) 747-4700.
