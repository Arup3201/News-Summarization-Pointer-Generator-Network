Even after the passion has faded a little, a goodnight kiss doesn’t seem too much to expect from your partner.

But according to research, it probably is.

Eighty per cent of couples no longer kiss each other good night, it found – because they’re so focused on getting to sleep.

Looking away: The survey of 2,000 couples found that 90 per cent do not say 'I love you' before they turn the lights out and 46 per cent of Britons sleep with their backs to their partners

A quarter said they cannot bear their 
partner to touch them in bed, while 90 per cent don’t even manage to say
 ‘I love you’ before they turn out the lights.

And such is their mission to get a good night’s rest that 46 per cent said they sleep with their backs to their partner.

But that might not be as bad as it sounds.

Corrine Sweet, a relationship 
psychologist, said the back-to-back position shows innocence and trust –
 and body language during sleep cannot be faked.

She said: ‘Inevitably, once the first 
flush of lust wears off, with couples naked and entwined, it is more 
likely that the need for a good night’s sleep predominates, so sleeping 
back to back becomes a favourable position in bed.’

Indeed, only 1 per cent of the 2,000 
couples surveyed by Travelodge said they sleep in what the researchers 
called the ‘heroic romantic movie scene sleeping’ position, with the man
 lying on his back and the woman’s head on his chest.

Miss Sweet said: ‘Couples fall into habitual ways of sleeping together that suits their personalities and personal preferences.

'If something changes in how they sleep together, this can …cause concern for the other partner.’

Real life? The 'heroic romantic movie scene sleeping' position famously portrayed in the Eighties film When Harry Met Sally (Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal pictured), is just a position for the camera
