The main talking point after Everton's defeat at Manchester City on Saturday was the performance of referee Andre Marriner. It wasn't great and Roberto Martinez was quick to point that out.

But I was more interested in an aspect of Everton's game that let them down badly – corners.

Everton fans will already be aware that their manager Martinez is not a big believer that set-pieces are a significant advantage – he said in an interview earlier this year: 'I do prefer open play goals, I'm not going to hide it. A goal from open play is a more satisfying goal.'

It's an admirable policy, unless you're trying to win at Manchester City when they are bang in form.

I thought Everton played well and possibly deserved something from the game. Joe Hart made one fantastic save from Romelu Lukaku but apart from that there were few chances created from open play by the visitors.

Their endeavour did, however, force seven corners. All of which were truly terrible. Here's the catalogue of corner cock-ups from Everton on Saturday:

1st corner – 39 minutes: Leighton Baines took it from the left, it was easily headed away by Yaya Toure on the edge of the six-yard box with no Everton player challenging for the ball at all.

2nd corner – 57 minutes: Kevin Mirallas took this one, again from the left, and it went high into the hands of Hart with no Everton player even close to the ball.

3rd corner – 68 minutes: Taken short by Mirallas, played back to him by Baines, the cross was lofted high into Hart's hands again.

4th corner – 72 minutes: Baines took this from the right. It barely left the ground and was easily cleared by Gael Clichy before it had even reached the six-yard box. Baines was then taken off corners.

5th corner – 81 minutes: Mirallas with an outswinger from the right. Headed away easily by Toure under no pressure whatsoever on the edge of the six-yard box.

6th corner – 91 minutes: Ross Barkley took this one, and again it was headed away on the edge of the six-yard box by Toure. No Everton player jumped with him.

7th corner – 95 minutes: Samuel Eto'o rushed to take this one with time running out. An outswinger from the right hand side. Headed away again by Toure on the edge of the six-yard box.

It makes embarrassing reading.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez admits he  prefers his teams to score goals from open play than set pieces

A corner is an opportunity to put a ball into the box, a chance to create a goalscoring opportunity. The corner taker can't be tackled, obviously, so it is a chance to deliver a ball unchallenged and unhindered. And yet all seven of Everton's corners at City were dreadful.

I would have thought a set-piece would be regarded as a great way to get something from a trip to the champions, but Martinez obviously disagrees. Even the two free-kicks Everton had close to the penalty area troubled the wall more than the goal – Mirallas taking both.

Martinez sees set-pieces as a negative.

'The hardest thing in football is to break a team down when everyone is behind the ball. A free-kick or a dead-ball situation is less in your control. But you are relying on the bounce of the ball or people switching off or doing their duties,' the Everton boss has said.

I understand his point, but if you are clever from set-piece situations, if you work on them on the training ground, then they might also give you an advantage. As much as defenders can set themselves ready for a corner, they don't know exactly what the opposition are planning with each delivery.

Kevin Mirallas took two free-kicks against Man City but troubled the wall rather than goalkeeper Joe Hart

On Saturday, Yaya Toure took up his position on the edge of the six-yard box and Everton gave him the ball from their corner.

To not believe that corner offered a significant advantage is one thing, but to effectively not bother trying to make anything with them isn't clever.

Martinez though is adamant: 'You are a winning team when you don't rely on set-pieces.' 

Except Everton lost a game they should have got something from because their set-pieces were so bad.

I love that Martinez treasures possession and tries to play football the right way. But with all those corners on Saturday, Everton gave the ball straight to Manchester City, which goes against his own philosophy surely?

The irony is that Martinez's finest moment in football came when his Wigan side won the FA Cup – against Manchester City – in 2013. The winning goal came when Ben Watson headed home… from a Shaun Maloney corner.

I suspect Evertonians will be hoping Finch Farm might see a few corners being taken this week.
