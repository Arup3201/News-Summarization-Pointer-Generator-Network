An image of a smiling young San Diego police officer taken with a man whose phone she had helped to recover may be the last image ever taken of her.

Officer Laura Perez, 25, came to the aid of Marshal Crawford after his wife's phone was stolen, and after she'd retrieved it for him, he asked the young woman to pose for a selfie with him so that he could show his wife the cop who got her phone back.

Five days later, Riverside County homicide investigators found the body of the mother-of-one in a storage locker in Moreno.

Authorities in Murietta have arrested Perez's own husband, Freddy Perez-Rodas, 27, and charged him with the killing. 

'She was a gentle person in a rough and tumble business and she handled herself with grace and finesse,' Crawford told NBC of his impressions of Perez.

'It’s just so painful to see someone that young, that vibrant not be with us and I ache for her daughter and family,' he said.

Perez-Rodas was arrested Wednesday and also faces arson and child endangerment charges.

An investigation was underway after police and fire department personnel responded to a house fire Wednesday night on Grand Oaks Court.

Domestic dispute: Police say Perez's husband Freddy Perez-Rodas, 27, shot her in the chest and hid her body in a storage locker

Police say Perez-Rodas admitted to killing Laura Perez during a domestic dispute and dumping her body in a Moreno Valley storage lot.

Authorities believe he shot 25-year-old Laura Perez in the chest during a dispute at their Murrieta home. She graduated from the police academy in December, according to the Escondido Police Officer’s Association.

Investigators ruled the fire an arson and accuse Perez-Rodas of setting the blaze to cover up the crime.

The couple’s four-year-old daughter was not hurt and is staying with other family members.

Perez-Rodas remained jailed Thursday, and it’s unclear whether he has an attorney.

The Escondido Police Officer’s Association said Perez graduated from the police academy in December.

'She was a shining example of how a police officer should conduct themselves and more importantly, how a human being should conduct themselves. Law enforcement and humanity is less today because of her passing,' Crawford posted after sharing the image on the Escondido Police Department's wall.
