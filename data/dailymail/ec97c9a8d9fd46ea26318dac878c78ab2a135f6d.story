Threat: Unite union General Secretary Len McCluskey found to continue using 'leverage' tactics against employers

Union boss Len McCluskey defied Ed Miliband yesterday by vowing to continue with ‘bully-boy’ tactics against employers after one militant campaigner was caught on tape joking about being branded an ‘industrial terrorist’.

Mr McCluskey, the leader of Unite, which is Labour’s biggest funder, vowed to continue with controversial protests at the homes of company executives, insisting they told ‘bad bosses that they have nowhere to hide’.

He insisted that so-called ‘leverage’ tactics had been demonstrated to work, winning victories for his union in a series of disputes.

Paddy Hill, a member of Unite’s campaign team, also defended his part in the bullying tactics employed during the Grangemouth dispute, following claims that bosses of the petrochemicals plant in Scotland were targeted by trade union activists for protests at their homes.

In a recording of remarks made at meeting of a new union think tank, Mr Hill said: ‘I don’t see anything wrong with it, I won’t apologise for it, and I’ll do it again when I’m asked to do it.

‘I’m an organiser and this week an industrial terrorist, apparently.’

David Cameron has announced that the Government is considering tightening the law to prevent cases of industrial intimidation.

The Prime Minister told MPs he was shocked by allegations that children of executives had had ‘wanted’ posters put through their letterboxes, while their neighbours had been told they were ‘evil’.

Following the Daily Mail’s revelations about Unite’s activities, Mr Miliband also said: 'I condemn intimidatory tactics. It is not how industrial disputes should be conducted.’

But yesterday Mr McCluskey, whose union has given Labour more than £8 million under Mr Miliband’s leadership, vowed not to retreat in the face of what he said were ‘unscrupulous smears’ directed at his union.

He told a Unite conference in Brighton: ‘Every day we read statements and press articles about Unite which do not come within hailing distance of the truth.

‘This shows one thing above all: Unite is making a difference. We have served notice on the establishment that fighting trade unionism is back - and the elite don't like it.

‘Of course, there is another agenda behind these attacks too. We are a proxy for smearing the Labour Party and Ed Miliband, since the same elite is now worried that a Labour government which may itself not play by the old rules is a possibility.’

The Unite general secretary challenged the Prime Minister to make recent remarks against the union, outside Parliament without the cover of parliamentary privilege.

The protests which had been highlighted in recent weeks were ‘as old as democracy - free speech and the right to peacefully demonstrate’, he added.

‘For that, our members have been described as “thugs”. We will see what the law makes of that phrase.

‘It is, at any event, a lie. These protests were peaceful, mostly silent, and of course had nothing to do with intimidating families, children, or anyone. In more than two years, we have not had a single complaint about our members' conduct on such protests, nor a single police charge.

‘This union is not retreating from leverage, or from the right to peaceful protest.

‘The most important thing to say about Unite’s leverage strategy is this:  Leverage has worked.  Leverage has won…

‘That is why it is now being attacked - because it is working. Leverage is about telling the bad bosses that they have nowhere to hide, challenging their conduct with shareholders, with clients and customers.’

Mr Hill, a Unite organiser in Middleborough and member of the ‘leverage’ team that ‘assisted’ with the Grangemouth dispute, shrugged off criticism of the union’s tactics by describing it as a ‘badge of honour’.

Tactics employed included a reported 25 protestors blocking a family’s driveway with an inflatable giant rat.

‘By the Daily Mail printing that we’re all thugs we’re all terrorists, we’re all God knows what they said about us, it’s easy for me to brush off…me and my colleagues and comrades just thought “that’s a badge of honour pretty much”,’ Mr Hill was recorded saying.

Conservative MP Priti Patel, a member of Downing Street’s policy board, said: ‘Nobody should have to live in fear of union bully boys demonstrating outside their family home – to hear them talking about it with such pride is chilling.

‘Ed Miliband refuses to condemn these “industrial terrorists” in case he upsets his union paymasters. If he is too weak to stand up to the unions his is too weak to stand up for hardworking people.’
