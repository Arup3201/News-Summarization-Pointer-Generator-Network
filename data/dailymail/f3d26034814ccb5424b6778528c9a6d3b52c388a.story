Harry Redknapp wants Sandro but would have to smash QPR's transfer record after Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy demanded £16million for the defensive midfielder.

Redknapp knows the 25-year-old well from his time as manager of Tottenham and is keen to nab Sandro, who seems out-of-favour with Mauricio Pochettino.

Sandro was absent from the Tottenham squad that lost 3-0 against Liverpool at White Hart Lane, but Levy wants double the original £8m fee that Redknapp paid in 2010.

Jermain Defoe remains on Redknapp's shortlist and MLS club Toronto are prepared to let him leave. 

Leicester City are the latest club to express an interest in Defoe, who has also been linked with Newcastle United.
