An aspiring actress quit her job as a waitress on Monday after claiming a customer crossed the line and grabbed her butt, and now she's penned a biting account of the inappropriate incident. 

New York waitress Laura Ramadei made sure to jot down the name of the man she claims felt her up from the information on his credit card, and has identified him as hedge-fund manager Brian H Lederman.

Lederman, a 57-year-old married man, has since hit back at Ramadei - saying he has 'grabbed plenty of girls' a**es' but not hers.

In a long post on her Facebook page, Ramadei described the incident that happened this week while she was working a shift at SoHo restaurant Lucky Strike.

Family-friendly establishment: On Monday, Ramadei gave her two weeks notice at Lucky Strike, the SoHo restaurant where she worked 

She says Lederman came into the family-friendly restaurant around 6:30pm with a friend a ordered Stoli vodka on the rocks. 

'When I asked you and your companion if you'd be eating, or needing anything else from me, you put your hand - ever so gently - ON MY A** and asked if you could take me "to go". 

'When I immediately stepped away and said "Sorry, what?" you probably gathered that I was and am not receptive of such advances from customers...

'I was wearing a loose-fitting, long sleeve shirt, jeans, and no makeup...so I'm not sure where the confusion arose as to what kind of service you were being provided,' Ramadei wrote. 

The waitress, who helps run an independent theater company, says she's worked as a bartender for five years since graduating with honors from NYU. 

During those years, she says she has been the victim of numerous inappropriate comments from customers but that it was this incident that inspired her to quit the service industry for good.

'I can't tell you how many times people have treated me horribly and I've memorized or photographed the names from their credit cards, fantasizing about internet revenge. But every time I've been tempted in the past (even after verbal attacks, physical affronts, or sexual harassment) I've stopped myself and let it go.

'So congratulations, Brian! You've done it! You broke this tired a** camel's back,' Ramadei wrote. 

She adds that while she is shaming him with the post, she didn't draft it as an attack.  

Money man: According to LinkedIn, Lederman is a hedge-fund manager for Swiss Performance Management and Fiduciary

'Maybe - just maybe - via the intimately connected internet world, my post will reach you, and you'll learn something about how hurtful and upsetting a small comment or gesture might be,' she says. 

Not much: Lederman also only tipped $2 on his $15.24 bar tab

That post did read Lederman, but it doesn't seem to have moved him much. 

The infuriated finance worker spoke with the New York Post to deny he ever touched the waitress. 

'I’ve grabbed plenty of girls’ a**es in my life,' Lederman said, 'But I’ve never grabbed hers.'

While he admits making the comment about taking her 'to go' - he says it was a joke and he was only kidding. 

Now, Lederman vows Ramadei will never get a service-industry job again.

'That f****** c***, for her to do something like that is pretty ridiculous,' he said.

'I will make sure she doesn’t get another job in New York City. I know everybody: the bar owners, the club owners—that’s a terrible thing to write about somebody.'

And to add insult to injury, Lederman only tipped the waitress $2 dollars on a $15.24 bar tab - a little less than 15 per cent which is considered the bare minimum for restaurants.
