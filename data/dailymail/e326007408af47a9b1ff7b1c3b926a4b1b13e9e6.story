Banned for life Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s trail of scorned women and legal battles is only getting longer.

Lawsuits attributed to Sterling’s philandering go back to at least 2002, when he and long-suffering wife Rochelle sued Alexandra Castro to recover all of the gifts he lavished on her during their affair.

The suit is nearly identical to the one filed by Rochelle Sterling against Vanessa Stiviano, 31, to recover the various luxury cars, money and an apartment husband bought for the much younger woman by her husband.

Sterling, 80, claimed in court depositions that the now 42-year-old Castro was a gold-digging ‘prostitute’  who was ‘a piece of trash’ that always ‘wanted to pull something and have sex,’ according to documents posted to The Smoking Gun.

‘That's all it was is sex, nothing more, nothing less. I didn't want to have any more sex with her. I couldn't physically,’ he told the court.

She performed oral sex 'all night long, Sterling continued. '[Her] best sex was better than words could express... it was purely sex for money, money for sex, sex for money, money for sex.'

The vile rant was in response to Castro fighting Rochelle Sterling’s demands to return a Rodeo Drive home the mistress claims was bought for her in return for catering to the tycoon’s every need.

Castro explained in court that Sterling was ‘very demanding’ and ‘very particular’ even when it came to his socks.

‘He gave me specific instructions on how to remove his socks, and if I did not do it exactly the way he wanted his socks removed, he would order me to put them back on and do it over again,’ she said.

Sterling promised to ‘purchase the residence and pay for all of the remodeling, furnishings, and all other expenses, including any taxes,’ Castro claimed.

He told her to put the property in her and her mother’s name after buying it so he had a place to visit her – she provided as evidence a picture of Sterling in the apartment in only his underwear, documents showed.

The soon-to-be former team owner also took Castro on trips around the world and paid her a monthly allowance of $4,500, she said.

But that spigot of generosity was cut off when their relationship ended in the summer of 2002.She soon moved on, but the real estate tycoon had not.

Castro claimed that he tried to rekindle their arrangement, but she wasn’t interested.

The Sterlings responded with a strikingly similar lawsuit to the one filed by Rochelle Sterling against Stiviano.

Sterling threatened Castro that ‘he would file a lawsuit against me to get back everything he had given me and that he would force me to hire attorneys and spend everything I owned so that I would go broke, and be forced to return to him for financial support,’ she said.

The mogul eventually reached a private settlement with his former mistress and even paid her legal fees after her lawyers claimed the payout deal was done behind their back, according to ABC News.

His lawyer represented Castro when hers took her to court over the unpaid fees.

Castro also infamously lived with boxer Mike Tyson prior to meeting Donald Sterling in 1999.

The legal wrangling over the Ferrari, two Bentleys, a range rover, an apartment and about $250,000 cash given to Stiviano by Sterling is only just beginning.

Stiviano denies she leaked the recordings that brought life as Sterling knew it to an end.She also insists their relationship wasn’t romantic.

The suit has yet to reach a courtroom, and attorneys for both Castro and Sterling declined comment.
