An eclectic group of influential British women, including Baroness Lawrence, mother of murdered teen Stephen, were yesterday unveiled as the stars of the new M&S campaign.

And now, the Leading Ladies latest campaign has been revealed in full.

Shot by iconic fashion photographer Annie Leibovitz - who recently photographed Kim and Kanye's Vogue cover - the SS14 campaign also features singer Rita Ora, actress Emma Thompson, supermodel Alek Wek, designer Lulu Kennedy, chef Rachel Khoo, and engineer Roma Agrawal.

The
 new shoot, which sees the ladies showcasing the store's seasonal designs as they pose in the British countryside, includes women from diverse backgrounds and 
professions, united by personal style and inspirational achievements.

'Whether
 it is through a selfless dedication to a cause, entrepreneurial and 
creative flair or pushing the boundaries of design, each woman is truly 
inspiring and unique in her own way,' says the high street giant of its 
new campaign stars.

A spokesperson for M&S said: ‘Our SS14 campaign is a celebration of style and accomplishment.

'These dynamic Leading Ladies represent the unique and diverse women of a modern Britain. They are united in their extraordinary achievements but confident in their differences.

'Marks & Spencer is a democratic brand which is relevant to women of all ages and strands of life; it is therefore natural for M&S to celebrate women in this way.

'M&S is extremely proud to have convened such an extraordinary group of exceptional women; this campaign is the embodiment of true British style, quality, diversity and success.'

The new campaign was shot in quintessentially British settings from a coastal scene in Camber Sands to the idyllic countryside of the Cotswolds.

The store's latest collection has clearly taken inspiration from the catwalk.

The new summer advert follows the saucy Christmas advert where Rosie Huntington-Whiteley stripped down to her underwear, which cost the high street giant more than £1million to make.

The high-profile M&S leading ladies campaign, which kicked off in Autumn last year, has also starred actress Helen Mirren, Olympic Gold winning boxer Nicola Adams, model Katie Piper, artist Tracey Emin, singer Ellie Goulding, US Vogue creative director Grace Coddington and Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of Save the Children International.
