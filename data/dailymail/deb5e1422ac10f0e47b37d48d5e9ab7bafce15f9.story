Dejan Lovren's reputation as a hardened  defender was slightly tarnished after the Liverpool star revealed his love for collecting Kinder Surprise toys.

The Croatia international showed off his somewhat worrying obsession with the miniature self assembly figurines that come packaged inside chocolate eggs by posting a picture of his collection on Instagram.

The image of around 70 carefully assembled small, cute animals was accompanied by a caption in his native Croatian that complained about the time it takes to build the toys - while declaring himself a 'true collector'.

The Croatia international has struggled to nail down a starting place since his move to Anfield

Lovren did come on for Liverpool's last game against Sunderland to help earn a 1-0 victory

The former Southampton defender arrived at Anfield in a £20million move last summer but has failed to make an impact and recently lost his place in the starting XI, which may have freed some time to engage in his hobby.

The centre-back has not started a game since Liverpool lost to Manchester United on December 21, although he did come on to replace Steven Gerrard as a precaution in the Reds' last game against Sunderland.

Whether  eating the chocolate that encases the toys is associated with Lovren's dip in form is not known.
