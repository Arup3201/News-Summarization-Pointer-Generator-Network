A holidaymaker has described how he was left with agonising second-degree burns after a Thomas Cook air stewardess dropped a flask of scalding hot water on him.

James Trotter, 59, had been looking forward to a hard-earned summer trip to Turkey with his wife Ann when he boarded the flight.

But moments after take off, the customer care officer was writhing in pain when a stewardess tipped a kettle of boiling water onto his arm, leg and shoulder while trying to pour a cup of tea.

Pain: Holidaymaker James Trotter suffered agonising second degree burns which later became infected

Mr Trotter spent his entire 11-day, £2,100 all-inclusive beach holiday to the Barut Hemera hotel in the resort of Side, in bandages, unable to walk along the beach, go to the spa or use the pool after the wounds became infected.

The couple are now taking legal action against holiday provider Thomas Cook for the distress and injury suffered.

He said: 'It was shambolic. It completely ruined our holiday. The pain was excruciating and I went into a bit of shock.

'It was an accident but I dread to think what the consequences would have been if it had been a small child.

'I now get moodswings and I have a fear of being around kettles.'

Wife Ann, 57, added: 'James had just a T-shirt and shorts on and the skin literally lifted off his arm.

'You could see it shrivel up right away. It was extreme. The crew had very little to offer in terms of treatments or medication.

'There were some foam pads and some cream but there was no first aid cubicle on the plane so we had to treat the wound in the toilet.

'It brings up a whole load of health and safety issues. There were big cracks in the flask and the seal had come off. These things should be checked.'

Cabin crew arranged for a paramedic to meet the couple when the flight landed in Antalya before James was taken to a first aid station within the airport.

Mrs Trotter, who was left to struggle with luggage on her own, claims that they were then told to pay €40 for her husband's treatment - or face arrest.

Despite James' injuries, the couple, from Dumfries, decided to carry on to the hotel where they paid another €140 for a doctor to change his bandages every day.

To add insult to injury, the couple requested to be seated away from the aisle on the return flight home - only to discover they had been given two aisle seats.

They are furious with the way Thomas Cook have handled their complaint after receiving a letter apologising for the 'bad start' they had to their holiday.

The company said the complaint had been passed to their legal department but the couple claim to have heard nothing since and are now taking legal action.

Mr Trotter said: 'It is coming up to four months since the incident and all we have had is one email and two letters. It has been us chasing it up but they are stalling all the time.

'If someone else had been burned on the plane that day there would have been no treatment for them because they had ran out of burn pads. It's shocking.'

Mrs Trotter added: 'I feel we have been brushed aside.  We just want things to be checked properly - and the toilet is not the best place to treat an open wound.

'The staff at the time were very apologetic but that should also have been followed up in a sympathetic manner.

'It shouldn't take three or four months for something to be done.  It has been a big let-down and we won't be travelling with them again in a hurry.'

Karyn McPhee, personal injury lawyer for Slater & Gordon, who are handling the legal action, said: 'The couple are distressed and angry at the treatment they received on this holiday with Thomas Cook.

'Mr Trotter suffered severe burns and was left in substantial pain which ruined the holiday for them.

'They do not feel they were cared for in the correct way and instead of relaxing on their dream holiday, they had to endure a holiday from hell.'

Thomas Cook confirmed that their legal team are still investigating the incident.

A spokeswoman said: 'The safety of our customers is of utmost importance to us, and we are concerned to hear of any incidents reported on our flights.

'We are thoroughly looking into this matter, and we will be in touch with the customer’s legal representatives as soon as possible.'
