A Briton walked naked through one of Dubai’s iconic landmarks after drinking eight glasses of rum, a court heard yesterday.

Businessman Richard Stabler, 33, had been with friends in a hotel on the Palm Jumeirah, an artificial sand island complex, when he left to go back to his apartment.

Witnesses claim he started ‘causing chaos’ and began to scream at a security guard before he stripped off.

Landmark: Drunk Briton Richard Stabler, 33, had been with friends in a hotel at The Palm Jumeirah in Dubai,  when he took all his clothes off and went for a stroll

Mr Stabler told police: ‘I had eight glasses of rum and then left the hotel. I went to my building and then I can’t remember anything... I can’t remember if I stood naked or not.’

He pleaded guilty at a Dubai misdemeanours court to being under the influence of alcohol in a public place at around 8.30pm on December 20 last year, but denied exposing himself.

The case was adjourned until March 27.
