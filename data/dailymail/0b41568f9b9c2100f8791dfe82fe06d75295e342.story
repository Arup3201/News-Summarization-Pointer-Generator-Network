A man born without arms has become a world-renowned artist by painting with his mouth and feet.

Tom Yendell, 50, has produced more than 500 works from his garage studio, using his lips, tongue, teeth, head, and feet to master different brush strokes.

Mr Yendell was born with birth defects caused by Thalidomide, a morning sickness drug with devastating side-effects, but determined to lead a normal life, said he hopes his ‘artwork proves that nothing is too big a hurdle in life’.

'No hurdle too big': Tom Yendell, who was born without arms caused by Thalidomide, a morning sickness drug with devastating side-effects, has become a world-renowned artist, painting with his mouth and feet

The artist and father-of-two, from Alton, Hampshire said: ‘Art is something I have always had a flare for. 

‘Even when I was as young as four I’d be scribbling and painting away.

‘If you don’t have the use of your hands, your feet and mouth are naturally the next best things.’

From his purpose-built studio he creates works, hundreds of which have appeared on cards, wrapping papers and walls through the Mouth and Foot Painting Association.

Mr Yendell, who has been a professional artist for 30 years, said: ‘You can use a combination of body parts - teeth, tongue, lips, the whole of your head and your feet - to perform different strokes.

‘I occasionally get cramp or muscle ache after a long period painting because you tense up when working on very intricate sections.

‘I’m not the most prolific of artists, preferring to spend a few solid days working on a piece than rush it.’

The artist is one of just 466 babies out of 2,000 to survive the effects of Thalidomide and has released a book detailing his incredible life.

He said: ‘Thalidomide was just one of those things that happen in life. You can’t do anything about it so it is better to get on with life and try and be a positive person.

‘I don’t see myself as somebody with a disability. Being born without arms has never been a problem for me, I just learn to adapt.

‘I don’t let anything stop me. Someone once described me by saying I wouldn’t play cricket for England, but I would probably play football for Spurs. That’s always been my attitude - just because one door is closed another will be open.

Artistic destiny: Mr Yendell said once he found art, it was his 'calling' and has never let having no arms hold him back saying 'I just learn to adapt' to create his art including this pictured work

‘I come from a very strong family. I was the youngest of five kids and having older siblings made life very normal - they treated me just the same as anyone else and didn’t go easy on me.

‘Once I found art at secondary school I knew it was my calling.’

Thalidomide, pictured, was prescribed for morning sickness but by the time it was pulled off the market 10,000 babies were born with a range of disabilities

The Thalidomide Trust says there are 458
 people currently in Britain affected by the drug, but that for every 
Thalidomide baby that lived there were 10 that died.

Thalidomide was originally prescribed as a 'wonder drug' for morning sickness, headaches, coughs, insomnia and colds.

Thalidomide babies often suffered missing or deformed limbs and extreme shortening of arms and legs, but the drug also caused malformations of the eyes and ears, genitals, heart, kidneys and digestive system. 

By the time the drug was pulled from the market, more than 10,000 babies worldwide had been born with a range of disabilities caused by the drug. 

The German company, the Grunenthal Group, which invented the drug has issued its first apology in 50 years to thousands of people born with disabilities in early September.

The Grunenthal Group said in a statement it 'regrets' the consequences of the drug used to combat morning sickness which led to the birth of children without limbs during the 1950s and 1960s.

But British charity Thalidomide Agency UK, which represents victims of the drug in the UK, has rejected the apology as insufficient and demanded compensation.

Freddie Astbury, the charity's head consultant, said Grunenthal needed to 'put their money where their mouth is' rather than simply express regret.
