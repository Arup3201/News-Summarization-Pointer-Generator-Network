Manchester United are working on a deal for Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen, as reported by MailOnline at the weekend.

The player is eager to move to Old Trafford and Arsenal are willing to strike a deal.

Talks between the clubs are expected to resolve a fee with the Belgium international having just one year left on contract.

Arsenal may seek players in return but Louis van Gaal still wants to assess some of his fringe players in person before letting them leave.

Vermaelen is still only 28 and although he has suffered a dip in form following the bright start to his Arsenal career, United believe it is something that can be restored and improved.

United also have a serious interest in Ajax left-back Daley Blind who excelled against Spain last week.

Liverpool have also been credited with an interest but that has not been confirmed by the club.

They
 have a set budget to work too and increased demands from Sevilla for 
Alberto Moreno and Southampton for Adam Lallana are forcing them to 
weigh up alternatives.

Bayern Munich's Xherdan Shaqiri and Lazar Markovic of Benfica remain in Liverpool's thinking as alternatives to Lallana.
