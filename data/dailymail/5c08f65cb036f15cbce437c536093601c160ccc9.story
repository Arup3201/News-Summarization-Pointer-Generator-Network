For all that they may exist at different levels, work with different budgets and different players, the challenge facing just about every single football manager is broadly the same. It is to be seen to be making progress or - at the very least - maintaining the status quo.

As he tries to negotiate a way through his second season in English football, this is most certainly the challenge facing Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini. That is why what happened in the Olympic Stadium on Wednesday night may transpire to be so significant.

During a season that has seen City struggle at times, Pellegrini and his players have needed something to build on, something tangible.

When Samir Nasri’s thunderous shot - perhaps the most ferocious of his career - found the back of the net after an hour here, it was tempting to wonder if that moment had arrived.

It is best to disregard the line credited to City chief executive Ferran Soriano in the days before Pellegrini was appointed in the summer of 2013. ‘Five trophies in five seasons’ was a handy soundbite but it was never meant to be taken seriously.

Football, at whatever level, is usually more nuanced than that.

It is about results, of course, but it’s also about progress made by individual players, about baby steps taken in different competitions.

When the ever-admirable Pablo Zabaleta sealed City’s remarkable victory in the closing moments here, his team had secured something that had appeared beyond them for so long this season.

City’s manager has never admitted it publicly but a sense of stagnation has seemed to characterise the English champions at times this season. That may have worried him a little ahead of this game in Italy.

Other managers in the Barclays Premier League will feel this, too. Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool, certainly, and also Roberto Martinez at Everton. Pellegrini, however, may have sensed something turn his way on Wednesday night. City are Premier League champions and still very much in touch with Chelsea at the top end of the table.

Now they are in the knockout stage of the Champions League, too, and the restorative power of that achievement may be measured in full over the weeks to come.

Are City currently the team they were this time last year? The answer to that question has to be no, both in the manner of their football and their results.

Although they were almost overhauled by a charging Liverpool towards the end of last season’s domestic campaign, there were times when Pellegrini’s team played with an authority and a momentum that has so far eluded them this time around.

However, City have a result behind them now which is perhaps as important as anything they have managed during Pellegrini’s time at the club.

Some may look back at Sergio Aguero’s late goals that brought City unlikely victory at home to 10-man Bayern Munich last month and talk of greater significance.

Certainly the European cause would already have been lost without them.

On Wednesday night, however, City won as a team and they also won without four of their best players. So perhaps this means more.

Take international footballers such as Aguero, David Silva, Yaya Toure and Vincent Kompany out of any starting line-up and the capacity to win big games will perhaps drop by as much as thirty per cent. That only serves to make this result even more impressive.

City’s issues this season have not centred around player injuries but more elusive factors of form and confidence, both individual and collective.

Some of Pellegrini’s best players have not been consistently at their best and that has damaged City.

On Wednesday night it was a little different.

City rode some good fortune at times - particularly early on - but who is to say they didn’t deserve it?

The statistics released after the game showed Roma had more shots, made more passes and won more corners. But they also showed that City’s players had run further.

As such, this was an away win founded on old-fashioned principles.

The size of the task facing Pellegrini’s team was huge. Despite their 7-1 humbling here by Bayern, Roma’s home record this season is actually very good and if City were to take the win they needed they knew they would have to find something rather special.

Early on, they struggled a little. Roma left back Jose Holebas almost scored and Gervinho troubled City in a fashion alien to those who watched him labour as an Arsenal player.

City did improve, though, and were reasonably robust in central areas while, in the attacking third, James Milner and Jesus Navas looked dangerous on occasion.

Ultimately, City produced something that has eluded them for so long, namely a ‘proper’ European performance.

They defended stoutly and broke to steal the lead with a stunning goal.

After that, there were scares. There were always going to be. Joe Hart made some saves that he will remember for a while just as Roma’s forwards missed some chances they perhaps shouldn’t have.

Over in Munich, things went City’s way, too, but we shouldn’t dwell on that.

Instead, we should dwell on what was a huge performance and a huge result for Pellegrini and City.

This is what grown-up European teams do.

It has been a while coming and it will be interesting to see if it proves to be a catalyst for change or something less meaningful.
