Just two hours after he gunned down unarmed teenager Michael Brown following, he has claimed, a struggle for his life, Darren Wilson showed ‘no apparent distress’ and scant physical injury.

Information leaked by the Ferguson officer’s supporters in the aftermath of the fatal shooting suggested that he had sustained facial injuries so severe that they called for X-rays and hospital treatment.

Now medical records released as part of the evidence presented to the Grand Jury and reviewed by MailOnline reveal a very different scenario.

The decision to X-ray Wilson, 28, was not a clinical one taken by his treating physician on the strength of his physical exam.

Instead it was Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson who demanded the officer be X-rayed.

And the officer was discharged less than two hours after admission with a prescription for anti-inflammatory Naprosyn - described in his doctor’s statement as essentially ‘prescription strength Aleve’ - and advice to ice his jaw if necessary.

Protesters tore the Missouri city apart in the nights following the August 9 shooting. When the Grand Jury’s decision not to indict the Ferguson officer was announced on Monday the city erupted once more with Brown’s stepfather’s screams of ‘Burn this b**** down’ before Ferguson PD Headquarters taken by some as a call to arms.

Chants of ‘Hands Up Don’t Shoot’ - a reference to a now disputed eye-witness account - have echoed across the nation, with protests staged in 37 states.

But while Ferguson burned Wilson has maintained that he has a ‘clear conscience’ about the shooting.

According to his statement Brown was the aggressor, wrestling for the officer’s gun and punching him twice in the face so hard that he feared a third punch would kill him.

But the medical records released in the evidence dump by Prosecutor Bob McCulloch show minimal physical injury and reveal Wilson to be ‘no apparent distress’ shortly after this fatal encounter.

The records describe Wilson as ‘Well appearing; well nourished; in no apparent distress.’

He head is ‘atraumatic.’ There is ‘no palpable pain, swelling, ecchymosis (bruising) or deformity’ to his eyes; ‘no obvious nasal injury’; ‘no swelling, deformity or crepitus (popping or cracking when moving)’ in his jaw which is shows only ‘mild ecchymosis (bruising), and mild to minimal palpable pain.

Despite claims that his neck was scratched and jarred in the tussle Wilson’s neck is described as ‘Supple and non-tender’ with only a ‘few faint superficial abrasions to posterior neck at hairline, no bleeding, no laceration and no bruising.

Notes made on the officer’s admission quote Police Chief Jackson as stating, ‘He needs x-rays he was hit in the face a couple of times’

All of the X-rays taken are described as ‘unremarkable studies.’

When interviewed by Federal agents the treating physician recalled: ‘He was brought in by his supervisor and two St Louis County detectives with the complaint of being punched in his jaw twice.

‘He complained of pain to the jaw area primarily the right jaw with a little bit of redness.’

Evidence: Darren Wilson's evidence to the grand jury included his description of Michael Brown's strength - 'I felt like a five-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan'

Claim: How Darren Wilson told the grand jury he feared he was going to die at Michael Brown's hands

Medical record: Evidence disclosed to the grand jury showed Wilson was 'atraumatic' and 'in no apparent distress' after shooting Michael Brown

Result: Wilson's records show he was discharged without doctors requiring further treatment, instead he was asked to discuss the assault with supervisors

Secret wedding: On Monday morning, it was revealed that 28-year-old Wilson (left) - who hasn't been seen in public since the shooting - quietly married his fellow officer, Barbara Spradling (right), 37, last month

Getting heard: Protesters in Ferguson walked through various stores with their hands raised - something that has become a symbol of their anger over the shooting of unarmed Michael Brown 

Wilson himself rated his pain level as six out of ten on the pain scale.

The doctor also told investigators that Wilson ‘appeared calm and in no distress at all.’

In his statement and subsequent television interview Wilson described Brown as appearing like ‘a demon’ and spoken of a struggle so violent and intimidating that he felt ‘like a five year old’ facing ‘Hulk Hogan.’

Despite the impression of a vast disparity in size between Wilson and Brown, at 6ft 4 Wilson is the same height as the teenager though some 80lbs lighter.
