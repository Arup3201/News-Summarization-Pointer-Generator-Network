While most newlyweds dream of falling into a hammock and doing precisely nothing immediately after their 'Big Day' one young American couple decided that a regular honeymoon just wasn't romantic enough for them.

Instead Mike and Anne Howard decided to pool their savings, quit their jobs and embark upon an epic adventure that turned into the world's longest honeymoon.

Covering six continents, 33 countries and 302 places in 675 days the holiday of a lifetime included 57,397 overland miles, 226,152 photographs, 110 hikes, 105 buses, 46 jars of peanut butter, 41 safaris and 39 scuba dives.

Snap happy: The couple took over 220,000 pictures on their travels

Mike said: 'We met a couple of friends who were talking about doing a 
round-the-world trip, and we spoke to another person who had just 
completed one. So we thought, we could take this nest egg and buy a 
house or a car, or we can do something that most people wait to do until
 they're retired.

'Why not do this in our late twenties and early 
thirties, and we'll have these amazing memories rest of our lives? '

And in true modern traveller style, the media-savvy New Yorkers blogged their every movement to their 15,000 online fans (check them out on Facebook.com/HoneyTrek).

Using Anne’s background as a magazine editor and Mike’s as a media strategist and photographer the couple launched the HoneyTrek.com blog to share the experience with friends and family.

Starting in South America, they moved through Africa, Asia and Europe, sharing snaps and updates with their followers on social media as they went.

Their travel philosophy was to go to places too far to visit while they have jobs and too rugged to tackle when they are old.

Their favourite place was Myanmar (formerly Burma) for the friendly people and fascinating blend of styles and cultures.

Mike also fell in love with Entre Cielos in Mendoza, Argentina. He said: 'Only one or two people before us 
had stayed in the property. They built a loft above an actual vineyard, 
and brought in a German treehouse architect. To get to the room, you go 
through the vines, off this ladder, and into this vineyard loft. There 
was a big Jacuzzi tub out on the porch. It was really great drinking 
wine there, having a vineyard loft experience.'

The couple say there are too many 
memories to list them all, but also highlighted having a cheetah jump on
 top of their open-roof safari vehicle in the Maasai Mara in Kenya, 
wreck diving the WWII ships in Coron, Philippines and watching the 
Northern Lights from the Arctic Circle in Norway as highlights of their 
immense trip.

And, maybe surprisingly for some married couples out there, they both say that the trip has made their relationship stronger. In an interview during the trip with CNTraveler.com Anne said: 'People were like, "You must really like your husband. I don't think I could spend that much time with mine." It made me, think, "Yeah, I do really love him. I think it's going to be okay, right?"

'You start to bond on a level that is not possible on a regular schedule. Your brain starts to fuse and you can sense each other's needs or humor or reactions. We play off of each other really well.'

Mike added: 'We've just become even better husband and wife than when we started. It's so amazing to have someone to share those experiences with, and the next day laugh about the scary thing that happened and become stronger for it.'

Mike and Anne are now turning their passion for travel into a business, offering bespoke advice to travellers wanting to follow in their footsteps through Trip Coach a 
one-on-one guide to world travel.

They say: 'We did our 675-day trip around the world for just under $40 per person per day, including flights, food, lodging, activities…the works. This is an average of the pricier countries like Japan, Australia and Norway ($75 per day) with the less expensive places like Bolivia and Southeast Asia ($20 per day). Traveling around the world turned out to be less expensive than the mortgage on our apartment.

'We were really scrappy on the road when not in nice resorts, which was 
maybe two times per month. We did all overland travel, and very few
 flights—and when we did fly, it was on miles.

'We also took shared vans and 
local transport. Our top travel tips include:

- have separate credit and debit card accounts in case one disappears

- pack the right technology; it’s the hardest thing to get on the road

- buy your flights as you go... an around-the-world plane ticket will cost more and severely limit your flexibility

'We would also say always travel overland via local transportation whenever possible as we think that is one of the most valuable experiences we've had on our entire trip. You miss so many things when you fly; on land, you see the scenery and the stops and the food stalls and the guys motorbiking through the rice fields and how locals live along the way.'

Angelica Malin, editor of online travel and lifestyle magazine About Time says: 'This couple did what we all dream of; escaping the 9-5 and travelling the world, each day more adventure-filled than the next.

'Holidays and honeymoons are often too rushed as trying to pack everything in at once. Here's five ways to make the most of your trip:1. Planning - make sure you use websites, guide books and friends to find out what's best and what can be missed in the city2. Get out early - carpe diem! You'll get the most out of your trip by getting out of bed. 3. Look for homestays and flat shares - if you want a taste of local culture, homestays are a great way to experience the local culture first hand4. Get flight ready - keep flight day stress to minimum by checking in online, and try to take minimal luggage.5. Look at seasonal timings - some countries may be cheaper to travel to at different times of the year, check out which destinations have more favourable flight prices in the less fashionable seasons.'
