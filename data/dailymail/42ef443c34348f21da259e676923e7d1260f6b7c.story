Jose Mourinho has revealed Mario Balotelli once stood him up to go watch Formula 1 instead.

The Chelsea boss called the Italian in for a meeting during their time together at Serie A side Inter Milan.

However, Mourinho was left high and dry as Balotelli failed to show because the striker was at the F1 qualifying in Monza.

Mourinho, in an interview with Clare Balding to be screened on BT Sport on Christmas Day, revealed: 'We had funny problems. I told him to be at 2pm in my office for a meeting and when I called him he'd gone to the Formula 1 qualification on the Saturday for the race on Sunday. 

'He said, 'meetings in your office I can have every day, but to see the Formula 1 is only once a year in Italy'. A couple of days later I had to laugh.'

Balotelli is renowned for his off-field antics, which include letting off fireworks inside his house while at Manchester City.

And Mourinho reckons the Liverpool forward could pen a bestseller. When asked what Balotelli's autobiography would be like, the Blues boss replied: 'A funny book, a good book! 

'He's a nice kid, in my time, needed support, needed the older players to support him because it's not good when that educational relationship is just between the manager and the player. 

'I always think that it's important that the people surrounding help the manager in that process.'

So, could Mourinho pen his own book about Balotelli's exploits?

'I could write a book of 200 pages of my two years at Inter with Mario, but the book would not be a drama – it would be a comedy,' the tactician said.

'I remember one time when we went to play Kazan in the Champions League. In that match I had all my strikers injured. No Diego Milito, no Samuel Eto'o, I was really in trouble and Mario was the only one.

'Mario got a yellow card in the 42nd minute, so when I got to the dressing room at half-time I spend about 14 minutes of the 15 available speaking only to Mario.

'I said to him: "Mario, I cannot change you, I have no strikers on the bench, so don't touch anybody and play only with the ball. If we lose the ball no reaction. If someone provokes you, no reaction, if the referee makes a mistake, no reaction."

'The 46th minute – red card!' 

Jose Mourinho was speaking to Clare Balding as part of a BT Sport Christmas Day double-bill of 'Clare Balding Meets' which features exclusive interviews with Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson. Watch the full interviews on BT Sport 1 from 3.30pm on Christmas Day.
