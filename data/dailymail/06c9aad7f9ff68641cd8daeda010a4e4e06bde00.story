Even the most patient of children might have difficulty recreating these Lego models.

The world's third Lego hotel is under construction in Carlsbad, California, complete with lifesize bellhops, chefs and a huge dragon in the lobby.

Legoland California is investing a reported £30million to build the three-storey, 250-bedroom hotel at the popular theme park.

The 250-bed Lego hotel will be the first in North America

Guests will be relieved to know the duvets and pillows aren't made of Lego in the themed rooms

The rooms are themed around the Lego lines Pirate, Kingdom or Adventure

Many features of the hotel are made from Lego and there is plenty of it for children to make their own creations

Each room is themed along one of the Lego lines - Pirate, Kingdom or adventure - and has a treasure hunt game inside.

The hotel is also set to include a heated swimming pool, restaurant and Skyline bar.

Set to open in April this year, it is the first Leg hotel in North America after similarly-themed hotels were launched in Windsor last year and in Denmark in 1991.

Many features of the hotel will be made from Lego and there will be plenty on hand for children to make their own creations.

Legoland General Manager Peter Ronchetti said the hotel 
project 'is by
far the biggest investment we’ve made' since the park opened in 1999.

The last major investment by the park came a few years ago, when it 
spent £12million on the Sea Life aquarium and an Indiana Jones-like 
adventure in 1920s Egypt.

The build of the Legoland hotel is expected to cost in excess of £30million
