These brightly coloured fish have been photographed happily operating an underwater car wash to help clean passing sea turtles.

Photographer Masa Ushioda, 43, described the fish as working 'like a car wash' and said the electric yellow, purple and blue fish worked enthusiastically on each turtle that checked in for a scrub.

The busy crew operated 60ft underwater in
 the Pacific Ocean off the Kona coast of Hawaii, America, in an area 
known as Turtle Pinnacle.

Mr Ushioda, who has two children and lives in Kona, said: 'A turtle cleaning station is like a car wash business - the turtles come in, get cleaned and go out.

'As soon as a new dirty turtle came into the cleaning station, all the fish abandoned the one they were on, and go for the newcomer.

'Obviously the dirtier, the better. On a typical day, during a 60 minute dive, more than dozen a turtles come in and out.

'After the fish leave, many turtles find a ledge or overhang nearby and fall asleep for another 20 minutes or so.

'But some leave the station as soon as the cleaning gets done.

After the clean is completed, many of the turtles find a nearby ledge or overhang where they rest for awhile

'For me, the key for the ultimate turtle cleaning picture was to get these yellow tang, Zebrasoma flavescens, in the frame.

'These yellow fish are the most beautiful but they are the most shy fish in the ocean.

'I had to approach very quietly without blowing bubbles and was lucky with these fish on this particular day, who were bold - that doesn't happen often.'

The 3ft long Green Sea Turtle is an endangered species but it is abundant in Hawaii.
