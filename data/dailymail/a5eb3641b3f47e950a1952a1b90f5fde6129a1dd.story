A Georgia bar owner has sparked outrage by displaying a sign outside his establishment calling Barack Obama a 'n***er'.

Patrick Lanzo, of Paulding County, insists that the sign beside the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar is not racist and is simply a political protest over the President's policies.

Yet the owner advertises his drinking hole as a 'Klan Bar' - a clear reference to far-right group the Ku Klux Klan - and has a history of catering to some of the most notorious racist organisations in the U.S.

Offensive: The large sign calling the U.S. President a 'n***er' is displayed prominently outside Patrick Lanzo's Georgia Peach Oyster Bar

The message on Lanzo's sign reads, 'I do not support the n***** in the White House.'

But Lanzo said he 'did not feel bad about anything whatsoever', according to Atlanta's Fox 5.

He added: 'I say just because you're offended 
by it doesn't mean you don't have the right to say something just the 
opposite.

Controversial: The Georgia bar owner says he is not racist, despite calling his establishment a 'Klan Bar'

'Therefore, they can go out and
put their own sign in their own yard and I will not be offended.

It is not the first time he has caused uproar by placing offensive slogans outside his bar.

In 2009, he installed a sign 
that read, 'Obama's plan for health-care: n***** rig it.'

Again, he maintained it was simply a protest against the government's policies on healthcare, rather than racist abuse.

Asked why he had chosen to use the word, Lanzo replied, 'Well, I've used it 
most of my life. There are different ways to put your opinion up, but 
that's just the words I choose.'

Fox 5 reported that Paulding County 
officials know about the sign, but can do little to prevent it.

In the U.S., hate speech is legal (except for obscenity, defamation, incitement to riot, and fighting words).

Laws prohibiting hate speech are unconstitutional in the U.S.; the federal government and state governments are broadly forbidden by the First Amendment of the Constitution from restricting speech.

Unchecked: Lanzo has angered the community previously by displaying similar signs criticising the president using racist language

Shocking: Lanzo also has displays of prominent black leaders alongside racist imagery inside his Paulding County bar

Unsuccessful 
protests have been mounted by the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], a group of which Lanzo bizarrely once 
told CBS Atlanta he was a member.

His signs have been a long-standing issue in the area, as have the
displays of prominent black leaders alongside racist imagery 
inside his bar.

Lanzo is not the first to 
protest against Mr Obama with language that many would consider patently 
racist.

Paula Smith distributed a much-maligned 'Don't re-n*g in 
2012' anti-Obama bumper sticker.

She too argued that neither she nor her product
were actually racist.
