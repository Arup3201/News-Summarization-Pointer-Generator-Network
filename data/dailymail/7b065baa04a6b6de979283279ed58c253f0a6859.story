This is the heart-stopping moment a downhill skateboarder travelling at high speed nearly smashes head on into an oncoming passenger coach.

The unidentified longboarder was speeding down what he thought was a deserted country road in Spain, until a white coach suddenly appeared round a sharp left-hand bend.

Swerving dramatically to the right to avoid what could have been a fatal collision, the daredevil ends up ploughing on to the tree-lined verge, which thankfully gives him enough space to slow down.

Instead of smashing into the front of the vehicle, the thrill-seeker tumbles down a tree-lined verge

Earlier on during the video the daredevil can be seen negotiating a series of sharp curves with amazing skill

His gloved hands appear to brush the road surface at times as he leans down low to make the turns

It is not clear how badly he was hurt, if at all, by his brush with death.

The three-minute film starts off with the adrenaline junkie pushing off vigorously as he builds speed at the top of his longboard run.

He whips round a series of twists and turns on the narrow, poorly surfaced country road with stunning skill and just a helmet for protection.

The film was shot by fellow boarder Alberto Alepuz, who was following behind with his camera.

 At the start and end of the film he warns: 'NEVER fully trust walkie talkies'.

Alepuz adds underneath the video posted on his Youtube channel: 'S*** can always happen while skating open roads.

'Unexpected cars can always show up, communication can always fail.

'This guy was very lucky this time.

'Downhill skateboarding is not a game. Always be careful.'
