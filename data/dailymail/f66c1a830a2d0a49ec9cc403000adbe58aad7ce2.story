Firemen are increasingly being used to take patients to A&E because ambulance staff are so overstretched.

They are having to turn their fire engines into makeshift ambulances even though they have only basic medical training and just a few bandages for equipment.

Union leaders say the public is being put at risk because the practice is becoming more common due to the increasing pressures on the NHS.

The revelation emerged as seven hospitals remained on a status of ‘major incident’, having declared they were struggling to cope with sheer numbers of patients arriving in A&E.

Over a 36-hour period on Monday and Tuesday, an unprecedented 13 hospitals across England announced they were experiencing ‘major incidents’, meaning they were drafting in extra staff and cancelling non-urgent operations. 

Such measures are usually reserved only for events when there are mass casualties – such as terror attacks or rail crashes.

And last night it emerged that another hospital was diverting mothers-to-be to a maternity unit 16 miles away because its labour ward was full of A&E patients.

Weston General in Weston-super-Mare said: ‘We would like to offer our sincere apologies to any women affected by this and who were referred to St Michael’s in Bristol instead.’

In Birmingham, the Heartlands Hospital has asked administrative staff including receptionists and office workers to help out on wards, even though they have no medical training. Figures on Tuesday showed A&E waiting times are at their worst in a decade.

Woman, 88, with broken nose made to wait 7 hours

An 88-year-old woman who fell and broke her nose had to wait more than seven hours to be seen by hospital doctors.

The saga began shortly after midnight on Monday when Jenny Knowles fell at her nursing home in County Durham.

Staff contacted her daughter, Gloria Wills, 66, who is an ex-chairman of the now disbanded Sedgefield Primary Care Trust. Workers at the home in West Cornforth rang 999 for an ambulance at 12.05am but Miss Wills said it was not until 3.30am before one operated by St John’s arrived and took her mother to University Hospital of North Durham.

At the overstretched A&E unit, it was only at 7.15am that an X-ray confirmed that dementia sufferer Mrs Knowles had a broken nose.

North East Ambulance Service said: ‘We would like to apologise to the patient.’

Great-gran’s family gives up after 16 hours

A frail great-grandmother spent 16 hours waiting to be treated at an overstretched A&E department after a suspected mini-stroke before her disgusted family gave up.

Aimee-Louise Richards said her 81-year-old grandmother, who she did not want to name, was taken by ambulance to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth last Thursday. It was for the same hospital that Florence Cunningham, also 81, had had to wait 11 hours for an ambulance.

Miss Richards said her grandmother spent two hours in an ambulance outside A&E before being transferred to a second ambulance at 1am. ‘It wasn’t until 4am that she was even brought into the unit and put on a trolley,’ she said.

The pensioner was taken home at 4.30pm after the family lost patience. Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust failed to respond to a request for a comment.

Yesterday the Fire Brigades Union – which represents 44,000 firefighters – warned that staff were increasingly being relied upon to cover for ambulances. 

General secretary Matt Wrack said: ‘The public are being put at risk because the Government have cut staff, resources and equipment in both the NHS and fire and rescue service.

‘In certain incidences, firefighters have been diverted away from their own work.’

The crisis has come about as many ambulance crews are queuing outside A&E – unable to drop off patients because it is so busy inside. So when another 999 call comes in, they are unable to respond. 

On Tuesday, an elderly woman who had fallen in the street was taken to the A&E unit at York Hospital, North Yorkshire, by firefighters passing through because the ambulance service was too busy. 

A paramedic later said there were queues of up to ten ambulances outside the hospital entrance.

But it is not an isolated case – County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Services both responded to three emergencies instead of ambulances in December and January.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘The crisis in ambulance services means that more and more 999 calls are being attended by fire engines and police cars.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Occasionally – as has been the case for many years – fire crews stabilise patients when first on the scene of a particular incident but fire engines are not being diverted as makeshift ambulances.’
