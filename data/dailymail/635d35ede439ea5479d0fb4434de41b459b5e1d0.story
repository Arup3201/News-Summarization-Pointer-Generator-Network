Despite losing 2-1 against Italy, England could take many positives from opening World Cup match defeat in Group D.

One of them was the form of Daniel Sturridge, with the Liverpool striker scoring on his World Cup debut after grabbing an equaliser for Roy Hodgson's side in Manaus.

It was a familiar sight for Reds fans, who have seen the striker score consistently since arriving from Chelsea last year, as was the 24-year-old's trademark dance celebration after his strike.

Needs work: Sturridge's celebration as a teenager lacks the finesse compared to today

Reappearance? England fans will hope Sturridge sticks to his original celebration if he scores against Uruguay

And as well as his overall play, it seems the former Manchester City hitman's dance floor moves have also made dramatic improvements over the last 10 years.

Footage of Sturridge scoring against a Barcelona youth side in 2004 for City's Under 15 team show a more wild take to the post-match dance celebration - perhaps lacking the finesse with his arms he would develop over the next decade.

England fans will hope Sturridge can continue his World Cup form to help shoot down Uruguay in a pivotal clash concerning the Three Lions' last 16 hopes.

But to prevent global embarrassment, we would rather Sturridge stick to his modern dance celebration rather than the teenager at a school disco.
