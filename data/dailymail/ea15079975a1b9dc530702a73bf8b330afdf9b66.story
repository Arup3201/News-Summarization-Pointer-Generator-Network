American Girl has sparked outrage among consumers following its announcement that two racially diverse dolls from its Historical range will be 'retired' - forcing the company to defend their decision.

'Cecile', of African-American descent and 'Ivy', who is Asian-American, will join two Caucasian dolls in being discontinued - a blow to the hoard of consumers who feel there now won't be enough racial diversity in the range.

The company was forced to defend its decision in a statement, claiming that it was a business decision and it is simply doing away with dolls that come in pairs.

The chop! Four dolls from American Girl's 'Historical' range have been discontinued, including one African-American and one Asian-American (pictured right), much to the disappointment of many customers

American Girl PR Stephanie Spanos told MailOnline: 'We’ve
 decided to move away from the friend-character strategy'.

Both
 African-American Cecile and Asian-American Ivy happen to be in pairs, 
as do Caucasians Marie-Grace and Ruthie, which is allegedly why they are
 being discontinued.

American Girl first announced their plans on Facebook last week.

'Soon,
 we’ll say farewell to Marie-Grace, Cécile, Ruthie, and Ivy. Complete 
your collection while supplies last - quantities are extremely limited' the statement reads.

More than 1,100 Facebook comments flooded in following the news.

The current cast: American Girl is doing away with the friendship pairs (pictured) which happen to include two racially diverse dolls, insisting this is the only reason they are being retired, not because of their ethnicity

'I guess Asians are no longer an important demographic to the American Girl company', complained one user.

'That would suck if you retire Addy next. She is the only African American doll left', mused another.

A closer inspection of the new changes however, reveals that some could be jumping to conclusions too quickly.

The company's Historical range, which celebrates various periods of American history, currently features 11 dolls, all priced at $110 each. Five of the dolls are from ethnic minorities, and six are Caucasian - a reasonably equal spread.

Blondes: American Girl has also been criticized for favoring the blonde dolls in its collection, none of which (pictured, Julie, Caroline and Kit) were retired in the company's latest shake-up to the range

American 
Girl's new shake-up will leave seven dolls in the collection, four 
Caucasians and three dolls of ethnic minority; Kaya, who is Nez Perce 
(Native American), Josefina, who is Hispanic, and Addy, who is 
African-American.

'Ivy and Cecile are the first two racially diverse characters to be archived out of nine in total since 2008'

The
 company hasn't yet announced details of the new dolls which will be 
added to replace the four retired ones, except for the news that it will
 be re-introducing Samantha Parkington, one of the original, Caucasian 
characters.

Ms Spanos, further explains that the company's decision to stop manufacturing four of the dolls has nothing to do with their appearances or ethnicity.

'American Girl has been archiving dolls from the historical collection since 2008, and the first seven dolls that we archived were Caucasian,' she says.

'Ivy and Cecile are the first two racially diverse characters to be archived out of nine in total since 2008.'

Three remain: Kaya (left) is Native 
American, Josephina (center) is Hispanic and Kaya (right) is African 
American, and they will all remain in the collection, alongside four 
Caucasian characters

History: Addy (pictured) became the first African-American doll to join the collection, in 1993, and will remain in the range

One of Facebook's many commentators took issue with this branding decision, referring to the soon-to-be extinct BFF's Marie-Grace and Cecile.

'This was a beautiful inter racial friendship....I LOVED it for that very reason. It is great for breaking down racism,' the comment reads.

'I'm tired of the "diversity of blondes" and pepto-puke-pink clothes. If I wanted that for girls in my life, I'd just buy a Barbie'

Upon studying the collection, we can see that if American Girl is guilty of favoring any specific characteristics over others, it appears to be its hair color preferences. All three blonde dolls from the Historical range avoided an early retirement, while the two Caucasians to be discontinued are both brunette.

'[I'm] tired of the "diversity of blondes" and pepto-puke-pink clothes. If I wanted that for girls in my life, I'd just buy a Barbie,' rants one commenter.

'I'm just sick of blonde doll after blonde doll when human hair comes in so many amazing colors... toys should reflect that,' writes another.

Choices, choices: American Girl is most popular for its 'create your own doll' service, which allows customers to purchase dolls with whichever features they want

It's not the first time American Girl, which has sold more than 23 million dolls since its launch in 1986, has faced angry complaints.

When Addy, the company's first African-American historical character, was initially portrayed as a slave, there was resounding disapproval.

And in 2005, Catholic and pro-life groups criticized the company for donating funds to an organization which promotes abortion rights and acceptance of homosexuality.

Still, let's not forget that American Girl's main attraction remains its 'create your own doll' service, which allows customers to build a doll with whatever features they desire.
