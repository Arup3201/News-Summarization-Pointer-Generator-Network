Jagger was wrongly thought to have been poisoned at Crufts, but his joint owners have criticised the Kennel Club for how it dealt with the situation

The owners of a prize-winning Irish setter who was wrongly thought to have been poisoned at Crufts have attacked the Kennel Club for its 'cold' attitude in dealing with the death of the dog. 

Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Tongeren, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show.

At first his devastated owners believed the dog had been giving cubes of beef laced with poison at Crufts, possibly by a rival, only for the Kennel Club to run tests which showed Jagger had eaten the it 28 hours after leaving the show in Birmingham.

The animal's co-owners, Belgian couple Aleksandra and Willem Lauwers and Leicestershire-based Dee Milligan-Bott and her husband Jeremy Bott have criticised the way the Kennel Club handled the situation, and said they faced a barrage of emails from the organisation after the dog's death. 

'We accept that we will never know the true facts of why, where and when Jagger ingested poison which resulted in his death,' the owners said in a joint statement, posted on their Facebook pages.

'We wish now to draw a line under this tragedy.

'We are extremely disappointed, the way the Kennel Club have handled the events surrounding the death of Jagger.'

The owners said they would have welcomed 'expert advice' with how to deal with the situation and the ensuing press attention.

They added: 'That would have been helpful, rather than the cold, impersonal emails and their own press comments regretting that Jagger had died after the show.'  

Jagger became ill when he returned to the Lauwers family home in the city of Tongeren, in Belgium. 

The couple called a vet but he suffered a fit and died before the vet arrived. Jagger - known by his show name Thendara Satisfaction - was owned by the couple's young son who was devastated at the death of his pet.

A vet acting for the couple carried out an immediate post-mortem on Friday March 6, confirming suspected poisoning.

The dog's owners said they had then contacted the Kennel Club by urgent email to its press office to report the dog's death and then faced a 'barrage' of emails from the organisation. 

Toxicology reports were sent to the Kennel Club last Saturday along with a timetable of Jagger's exact movements, the dog's owners said.

In a statement issued on Monday Crufts said it was 'inconceivable' that the dog had been given two fast-acting poisons at Birmingham's NEC between 28 and 36 hours earlier.

Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko said: 'There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog-lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible.

'It is highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death.' 

They said the poisons - identified as carbofuran and aldicarb - were fast acting and severe symptoms would have set in two to three hours after them being eaten. 

Jagger belonged to the Lauwers' son Jeremy who was very close to the three-year-old Irish setter

Aldicarb and carbofuran are insecticides which are used in agriculture - but are not approved for use in the EU.

Nick Edwards, senior information scientist for Veterinary Poisons Information Service, said: 'We would expect the clinical effects, if ingested by a dog, to be rapid in onset; normally between half an hour and three hours.

'After this time a combination of clinical effects, if the toxins were taken in sufficient quantities, would likely be present, including weakness, collapse, diarrhoea, slow heart rate, difficulty in breathing and excessive salivation.' 

The comments from the Kennel Club about the poison were made after fears were raised that six dogs had fallen ill after performing at the dog show. There is no evidence to suggest any were poisoned at Crufts and the Kennel Club said there had never been a confirmed case of poisoning in the show's 124-year history. 

Dee Milligan-Bott was a co-owner of Jagger who took the animal to Crufts, where he achieved second in class

Jagger is thought to have died after eating two fast acting poisons, which the Kennel Club believes he must have eaten after returning to Belgium - rather than at the world's biggest dog show 

A spokeswoman for Crufts said: 'As dog owners ourselves we understand how heart-breaking the loss of a beloved dog is and we have continually offered our sincere sympathies and support to the owners throughout all of the contact that we have had on the telephone and by email and we continue to do so.' 

She said they had offered the families support with making statements about the investigation. 

'Both we and the owners have expressed our desire to draw a line under this, so that the owners can grieve privately,' she added. 'The only way the truth about who poisoned Jagger and whether or not it was intentional can possibly now come out is via a police investigation.'

Jagger was cremated last week at a special centre for family pets twenty miles from the family hom in Belgium. 

The Lauwers said they brought his ashes home and plan to spread them in the coming weeks in woods near their home where he liked to walk. They also wanted to spread some of his ashes in Kilby, Leicestershire where he was born and his British co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott runs a kennel.
