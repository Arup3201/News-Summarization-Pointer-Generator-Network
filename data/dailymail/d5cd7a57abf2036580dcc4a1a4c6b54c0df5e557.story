A college football coach has spoken of his joy at being cleared of child pornography charges stemming from cellphone videos he filmed of his kids dancing naked after a bath.

Todd Hoffner said he was 'thankful to be waking up from this nightmare' during an emotional news conference alongside his wife after a judge dismissed the case today.

The head coach at Minnesota State-Mankato was arrested in August when the videos were found on
his university-issued phone after he took it to the I.T. department to 
be checked out.

Emotional: The football coach revealed the toll the charges had had on his family life

The three videos showed his children - aged five to nine years old - dancing around naked in their home and touching their private parts.

On Friday, Blue Earth County District Judge Krista Jass said she had not found any evidence that the videos amounted to pornography.

'The videos under consideration here contain nude images of Defendant's minor children dancing and acting playful after a bath. That is all they contain,' she wrote in her 24-page ruling.

'My wife and I have anticipated this day
for a very long time,' Hoffner said after his acquittal. 'It has 
finally taken a person with courage and authority to realise what these 
videos were.'

Overwhelmed: The coach appeared to have tears in his eyes at the end of his news conference

Media storm: Hoffner has been firmly in the public eye since being arrested in August

The university placed Hoffner, who has 
been the school's head football coach since 2008, on administrative 
leave after the videos were found.

He now says he is keen to return to work, but a spokesman for the university said he would remain on leave pending the school's own investigation. He had no timetable for when that could be completed.

Dismissed: Hoffner had been charged for making child porn for footage of his children naked

Hoffner, 46, and his wife, Melodee, had both maintained there was nothing inappropriate about the videos, which they said simply showed the children being silly.

His attorney Jim Fleming singled out Mike Hanson, an assistant county prosecutor, for bringing charges in the first place. 'Mr Hanson essentially argued that this was child pornography because he knows it when he sees it,' Hoffner said.

A search of computers taken from the 
Hoffner home has found 'no additional items that would be considered 
child pornography,' said Blue Earth County Sheriff's Captain Rich Murry.

Hoffner had been charged with one 
count of using minors in a sexual performance or pornographic work and 
one count of possessing child pornography. Both are felonies.

Hanson - who cast the final decision that the images were 
pornographic and an arrest had to be made - had said: 'Adults should not
make videos of children in lewd poses - period.'Â 

But in court, Hoffner explained the context surrounding the videos.

Two of them - which prosecutors said are the most troubling - show his children fooling around after a whirlpool bubble bath. They drop their towels and run around naked.

At one point, the eight-year-old son grabs his genitals and his daughters bend over and spread their buttocks apart. These were shot in June.

Support: Hoffman's wife Melodee publicly rejected the charges as 'ridiculous and baseless'

Hoffner told the court, that after 
their bath, the children came down to where he was working and asked 
their father to videotape them because they had made up a skit and 
wanted their dad to record it - which he did on the work Blackberry, 
according to the Star Tribune.

'It started with their towels on,' he said. 'They were singing, dancing and laughing. They were doing silly things, having fun.'

He said his son seemed determined to 'sabotage' his sisters' routine and jumped in front of them and 'grabbed his private parts' for a few seconds.

He said he stopped recording at this 
point but then his daughters, who were upset with their brother, asked 
them to record it again. This time, the son ran in naked with just a 
football helmet on. Hoffner said at this point he stopped recording as 
he knew his son was determined to 'mess everything up'.

In an August video, one of the coach's 
daughters is woken up by her father and told to go to the bathroom. As 
she is followed to the bathroom, the camera is focused on her underwear.

He said he did not show the videos to anyone and did not even view them again after taking them. In fact, he forgot they were even on there when he took his phone to the university's IT department, he told the court.

But Hanson said it is for this very reason that charges should be withheld. He said: 'You typically have videos made to show to your friends or put on Facebook. That didn't happen here and it didn't happen for a pretty good reason.'

Hoffner said he was genuinely shocked when he was arrested on the pornography charges and he had no idea what videos they were talking about.

A search of computers and other equipment taken from Hoffner's home when he was arrested turned up no evidence to support the prosecution's case. Social workers who interviewed the children and saw the videos said they found no evidence the couple's children had been abused.
