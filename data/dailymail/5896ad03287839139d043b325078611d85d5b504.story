Trouble: Khan was arrested for an alleged assault in Bolton in the early hours of Friday morning

Khan is alleged to have drawn alongside the men in a Mercedes C Class at around 1.30am after he was taunted.

A witness told the Bolton News that Khan responded by saying: 'Don’t you know who I am, I am AK,'

One of the alleged victims is believed to have suffered an injury to his cheek and the other an injury to his leg. Neither required treatment.

Another witness said: ‘I could hear a lot of noise and I saw Amir’s car. Then I saw him get out of the car. Then he drove off and there was a man on the floor.’

Khan had earlier posted a photo on Instagram of him enjoying a meal in Preston.

Incident: The alleged incident took place outside on Russell Street in Bolton in the early hours of Friday

A spokesman from Tangerine PR, which represents Khan, said: 'Amir Khan was arrested on suspicion of common assault in the early hours of
Friday July 4.

'Amir has since been released without charge on bail
pending further enquiries. At the stage we are unable to comment further on
this matter.'

A police spokesman said: 'A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of two assaults and has been bailed until mid-July pending further enquiries.'

Khan, a former light-welterweight champion, last fought in May when he outpointed Luis Collazo on his welterweight debut.

He expects to return to action later this year.
