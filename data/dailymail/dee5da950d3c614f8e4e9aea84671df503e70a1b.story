North Korea has issued a furious statement slamming the United States for imposing sanctions against its government in the wake of Sony's cyberattack.

It again denied any role in the breach of tens of thousands of the entertainment firm's confidential emails and business files.

An unnamed spokesman of North Korea's foreign ministry on Sunday accused the U.S. of 'groundlessly' stirring up hostility toward Pyongyang. 

Anger: An official in Kim Jong un's government slammed the US's 'groundless' sanctions against North Korea

It warned that the new sanctions - leveled against government officials and the nation's defense industry - would not weaken the country's military might.

The state-run TV station quoted an official as saying: 'The policy persistently pursued by the US to stifle the DPRK [North Korea], groundlessly stirring up bad blood towards it, would only harden its will and resolution to defend the sovereignty of the country.

'The persistent and unilateral action taken by the White House to slap 'sanctions' against the DPRK patently proves that it is still not away from inveterate repugnancy and hostility toward the DPRK.'

Controversy: It came after North Korea expressed anger at the movie The Interview about Kim Jong un

North Korea has expressed fury over the Sony comedy flick 'The Interview,' which depicts the fictional assassination of leader Kim Jong Un. 

However, it denied involvement in the cyberattack against Sony, which later escalated to threats of terrorist attacks against movie theaters. 

The film was released in limited theaters and online amid fears of a backlash.
