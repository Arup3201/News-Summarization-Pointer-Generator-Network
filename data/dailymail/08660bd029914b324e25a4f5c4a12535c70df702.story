Every day, a student attending Georgia Technical College was forced to walk 15 miles each way to class because he didn’t own a car.

But last month, a hit-and-run driver left him with a slew of serious injuries, making the walk impossible for 20-year-old Branden Whitehead.

Now, thanks to the generosity of Vanessa Peebles, a woman who saw the student’s story on the local news, Whitehead can drive to class.

Baby you can drive my car: A generous woman in Georgia donated her 1990 Cadillac to 20-year-old student Branden Whitehead, pictured

Hot wheels: The 1990 Cadillac Fleetwood means that Whitehead will no longer have to walk 15 miles each way to class

Peebles, who was touched by the student’s story after seeing it on a local news report, gave only one condition to her benevolent gift. ‘I want to see you a surgeon one day,’ she said.

Whitehead is studying to be a surgical technician. He said that getting the 1990 Cadillac Fleetwood has only inspired him to work harder toward his dream.

‘I’m thankful to be alive,’ he told MyFoxAtlanta, ‘and that makes me want to be a surgical tech even more.’

Last month, Whitehead was walking the 15 miles in Coweta County, Georgia. He said that a car came out of nowhere, throwing him up in the air.

Caveat: Peebles said that he gets to keep the car on the condition he continues to do well in school

Roadside damage: He was struck by a hit-and-run driver last month on his walk back from school, puncturing a lung and broke a few ribs

Grateful: The thankful student gives Peebles a hug for her generosity

‘All of a sudden, out of nowhere, I felt a sharp pain and I blacked out,’ he told MyFoxAtlanta at the time. ‘When I woke up, I looked down at my arm – there was a puddle of blood.’

He suffered several injuries, including broken ribs, cuts, bruises, and a punctured lung.

The student was in the hospital for five days as he recovered. He said his 30-pound backpack, stuffed to the brim, might have saved his life.

Police in East Point are still trying to track down the hit-and-run driver.

The car, which rumbles ominously before starting, no doubt needs some work, but for Whitehall, the gift is beyond measure.

And perhaps the best news of all? Rather than walking four-and-a-half hours each way, the trek to class only takes Whitehead 15 minutes.
