This is the touch-and-go moment a lost dog is rescued by a team of thick-skinned firemen after getting trapped in the middle of a frozen river.

Video footage shows emergency workers swimming out to Cooper the Goldendoodle as he sits shivering  on a sheet of ice on the Charles River in Wellesley, Massachusetts.

He is then grabbed by his collar and hauled back to shore in a sleigh before being wrapped up warm in a blanket.

At the end of the clip Cooper's owner, Jared Bartels, is seen bounding up to give the eight-year-old pooch a big hug.

'Thank you, guys, I appreciate it,' the father-of-three tells the animal's rescuers.

The recovery mission took place on Sunday morning with temperatures around freezing. 

It's not known how long Cooper was on the ice for but he went missing around 4pm on Saturday after he got spooked and ran off during a walk.

The Bartels family were distraught by the pet's disappearance  and swiftly made flyers.

One of the first people to see the flyers said they saw Cooper on the ice and called authorities. 

Police said Cooper was found soaked and stranded in a tree. He was unable to get to shore due to the flowing river and thin ice.

Firefighters donned cold water ice rescue suits before they plunged into the river to save the canine.

It is apparently the third time a dog has fallen through the ice on the Charles River over the past year. 

Luckily Cooper was saved in the nick of time and vets later gave him the all-clear after being evaluated for exposure.
