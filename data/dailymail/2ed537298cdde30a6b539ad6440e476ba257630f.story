Clayton Real, 18, was found dead on September 5 after a house party near Nebraska-Lincoln university. Four fraternity members have now been charged over his death

Four members of a Nebraska university frat house have been charged with supplying the alcohol that an 18-year-old freshman binged to death on.

University of Nebraska-Lincoln student Clayton Real was found dead in his room at FarmHouse fraternity house on September 5 after passing out at an off-campus party the night before.

Vance Heyer, 21, the frat vice president, Thomas Trueblood, 19, the society chairman, Cory Foland, 21, the new member educator, and 22-year-old Ross Reynolds, a frat member, have all been charged with procuring alcohol for a minor resulting in death.

Trueblood organised the event after contacting  friends who were willing to host the party at their house, according to a police report.

Heyer, Foland and Reynold all supplied the alcohol, including a keg, two crates of beer, whiskey and vodka.

Witnesses reported seeing Real, an agricultural economics major, getting drunk at the event before passing out at around 12.30am.

Members of the fraternity took him back to his room where they left him asleep, before calling medics at 7.30am. Mr Real was pronounced dead at the scene.

Tests showed Mr Real's cause of death was acute alcohol intoxication, with a blood-alcohol content of .365 - four times the legal driving limit.

Mr Real had suffered from Type 1 diabetes since childhood, though the accused say they took his blood-sugar level before putting him to bed, and decided he did not need medical attention.

Around 80 people attended the party. Hosts, Marin Hartfield, 20, and Lauren Williams, 20, have been ticketed under city ordinances for maintaining a disorderly house.

Thomas Trueblood, 19, organised the party after finding friends willing to host the event at their house near the university (pictured).  Vance Heyer, and Cory Foland, both 21, and 22-year-old Ross Reynolds, bought alcohol for the event - including a keg, two crates of beer, whiskey and vodka

William Miller, 21 a member of the frat, was ticketed under a misdemeanor offence after police said he gave the pair vodka in return for hosting.  

Following the arrests, UNL suspended the fraternity chapter indefinitely, meaning more than 20 freshmen were forced to find another place to live.

'We have taken appropriate action, given the seriousness of the matter,'  Juan Franco, the university vice chancellor for student affairs, said at the time.
