After their Premier League title challenge faded away at the back of last season, Arsenal have started the summer in exactly the right fashion.

The signing of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona in a £30million deal was confirmed on Thursday; the second highest transfer in the club's history,

The Chilean's arrival has provided fans with genuine belief that they can prolong their stay at the top of the table this season, while adding to the many attacking options at Arsene Wenger's disposal. But how will the team shape up?

A Gun deal: Here's how £30million signing Alexis Sanchez will look in the new Arsenal kit

Signal of intent: The Chilean has the potential to play in all the front areas; he can be whatever he wants to be

Reason to cheer? Arsene Wenger could revel in a first title win in 10 years

Challengers: How Arsenal could line up next season

'Players win games, squads win titles,' is a quote often banded about when talking of Premier League glory, and a way in which the Gunners have fallen short in recent years.

Too often key players have picked up injuries at crucial times of the season, too often there hasn't been enough adequate cover in the squad.

Take last season, when Wenger had to call upon the inexperienced Yaya Sanogo in pivotal games due to Olivier Giroud's form and fitness worries.

But after convincing Sanchez to join, Wenger has a wealth of attacking options available.

The 25-year-old has proved himself in many positions during some impressive displays for Barcelona and Chile. He has the potential to partner Giroud (who will realistically start due to the physical nature in England) or supply him from the left and right. Couple that with Theo Walcott's imminent return from knee injury, and the French striker can no longer complain of being isolated up front.

And if that doesn't sound exciting enough, it should also see Mesut Ozil drastically improve. The German playmaker was the star of the last transfer window - signing for £42.5m - but struggled to adapt to English football, not helped by the lack of pace to supply.

Now the Gunners could simply blow teams away with pace and style. 'Playing the Arsenal way,' as Wenger would put it. The boss has been patient for so long, and has been rewarded with the money to go out and attract the world's best.

Set to shine: £42.5m man Mesut Ozil will benefit from having runners in Sanchez and Theo Walcott

Happy again: Ozil has shown what he is capable of at the World Cup with Germany

Confident: Theo Walcott's encouraging run of form was cut short by injury last season, but he's recovering now

Injury free: Aaron Ramsey will be keen to shine once again this season

See you soon: Mathieu Debuchy will be a £10m replacement for Bacary Sagna at right-back

Arsenal's new-found solidity last season (taking away the demolitions at Anfield, Stamford Bridge and the Etihad Stadium) had the look of a title-winning system, though surprisingly the team were let down by goals. It's safe to say that should not happen this year...

Mathieu Debuchy will be confirmed as Bacary Sagna's £10m replacement, giving Wenger a proven right-back capable of stepping up to the first team immediately.

Mikel Arteta was often the scapegoat in poor away performances, and Arsenal are looking to strengthen that midfield area.

Sami Khedira and the Bender brothers have been linked but Morgan Schneiderlin would be a more-than adequate signing to bolster Arsenal's spine.

The Southampton man is eager to get away from a side who are selling the majority of their key players. One point which is often brought up to reference Arsenal's failures in years gone by is lack of strength, both mentally and physically. But this squad would have the experience and sheer size to challenge on all fronts.

The Puma kit launch on Thursday stressed the message; Future, Forever, Victorious. Something just feels right.

Strong: Morgan Schneiderlin could bolster Arsenal's spine

Believe: Arteta, Giroud and Cazorla are depicted in front of the London eye

Tear jerker: Arsene Wenger gave an inspiration speech for the Puma kit launch on Thursday

Away kit launch: But Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will find it tough to break into the starting eleven this season

Midfield options: Jack Wilshere will be looking to turn potential into consistency

With all these impressive changes going on in North London, it may be hard for young England stars Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to make a permanent impression on the first team.

Both were affected by injuries last season, and will have been looking to kick on as they turn teenage stardom into consistency on the pitch.

Saying that, they certainly have the potential to make an impact from the bench, as well as Lukas Podolski.

Santi Cazorla will be another key member of the squad at the Emirates, though the 29-year-old misses out here due to the thought of Sanchez and Walcott racing through on goal from the flanks, The Spaniard is also linked with a move back to his homeland.

Unveiled: But Santi Cazorla has been linked with a return to Spain this summer

In today, gone tomorrow? Thomas Vermaelen is expected to leave the club this summer

Abject: There were too many horror shows away from home last season

The early transfer window movement is already triggering thoughts of an intriguing title race.

Liverpool (who were beaten to the signing of Sanchez), though selling Luis Suarez, have strengthened their squad in Emre Can and Adam Lallana. Manchester United are building a new legacy with Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera under Louis van Gaal.

Chelsea made the biggest early impact this summer by announcing Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, but Arsenal may well have trumped them with a signal of intent.

Make no mistake, the Gunners are in the hunt this year. And don't be surprised to see them end that 10-year wait for a title.
