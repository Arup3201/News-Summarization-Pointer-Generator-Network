Cheaper clothing, cars, household goods and electronic items are just some of the wins for consumers after Australia signed an historic free-trade deal with China worth an estimated $18 billion over a decade.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Chinese President Xi Jinping witnessed the signing of the pact by their respective trade ministers after Mr Xi addressed federal Parliament in Canberra on Monday afternoon, during which he praised Australia as a country of 'dynamism and innovation'.

Under the deal, 85 per cent of all Australian exports will enter China tariff-free, with this figure expected to rise to 93 per cent within four years and 95 per cent when it is in full force.

The agreement also removes significant trade barriers for agriculture, resources and energy, manufacturing exports and investment.

Australia and China will reportedly sign a free-trade deal  worth $18 billion over a decade

Mr Abbott is confident the new pact will 'add billions to the economy, create jobs and drive higher living standards for Australians'.

China is Australia's number one trading partner, with the two-way flow of goods and services exceeding $150 billion last year.

Trade between the countries was worth just a quarter of that amount a decade ago.

Mr Xi told parliament his country of 1.3 billion people was a 'market of immense potential', importing more than US$10 trillion in goods over the next five years and investing $500 billion overseas, while its people make over 500 million overseas visits. 

To further strengthen ties between the two nations, Mr Xi later announced a fifth Chinese consulate-general in Australia will open up in Adelaide, South Australia.

The free trade deal is a boon for farmers, with fresh Australian milk selling at up to $9 a litre in China

Trade expert Alan Oxley said the main benefit for consumers in the long run would be in the fashion industry.

'But with the way the dollar is jumping around the place, we might not notice for a while,' principal of ITS Global Mr Oxley said.

Mr Oxley said Australian exporters of food – especially dairy – would be big beneficiaries of the trade deal in the near future.

'In China there is a fair degree of fear about healthy food,' he said.

'There's a rising fear of people in the middle class willing to pay more for products, and the demand for food is just stupendous.

'That's the future for our farmers.'

Mr Oxley said the trade deal would also enable Australian services industries to do business in China. 

'Medical services, finance and insurance companies will be able operate in other markets.

'They'll be able to expand their business and do more business.

'That's the real long-term importance of this, because it's not goods that generates the growth it's services.'

Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who has done much of the heavy lifting on the deal over the past year, said Australian manufacturers, farmers, miners and the service sector should be very happy with the agreement.

Beef and dairy producers are set to benefit from a phase-down in Chinese tariffs, with dairy exports moving to a similar tariff reduction schedule as New Zealand, NewsCorp reports.

Mr Robb described the China free trade deal as the completion of a 'powerful trifecta', but could not put a dollar figure on the final leg.

But it looks to be huge.

Mr Robb revealed the agreement with Beijing - coming hot on the heels of FTAs with Japan and South Korea - was concluded at 'five minutes to midnight' and, as a result, there was no time to do the modelling.

A figure of $18 billion is frequently banded around, but that is from modelling done 10 years ago and does not include benefits to the services sector.

And services are the breakthrough of this deal with greater access to China for Australia's banking, insurance and securities firms.

'China realises if it is to become a domestically focused economy it will be a service-based economy overwhelmingly,' Mr Robb told reporters in Canberra before he signed a declaration of intent with his Chinese counterpart.

Asian middle-classes are expected to grow from 600 million to three billion over the next 30 years.

'They will need our services,' he said. 

Australian rice, sugar, wheat and cotton will miss out on benefits, but could be winners when a built-in review is conducted in three years.

Manufacturers, miners and the service sector including finance and tourism industries are expected to make gains.

On entry into force, 92.9 per cent of China's imports of resources, energy and mining products from Australia will enter duty-free, with most remaining tariffs eliminated within four years.

It will lock in zero tariffs on Australia's two biggest exports, gold and iron ore, as well as the booming liquefied natural gas industry.

The three per cent tariff on Australia's third largest export to China, coking coal, will be axed on day one of the agreement.

Chinese televisions, clothes and cars will be cheaper.

Tariffs will be abolished for the $13 billion dairy industry and beef and sheep farmers will benefit from the abolition of tariffs ranging from 12 to 25 per cent.

All tariffs on horticulture will be eliminated.

China will allow greater access for legal, financial, telecommunications, tourism, construction, health, aged care, mining and manufacturing services.

With the agreement required to run the gauntlet of a parliamentary inquiry and the passing of some legislation, the government will need to win over Labor, the Greens or crossbenchers on changes to foreign investment and opening of the labour market.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Labor welcomed the deal which came out of a decade of negotiations.

'We look forward to examining the detail of the final agreement,' he said. 

The Foreign Investment Review Board screening threshold for private Chinese companies investing in 'non-sensitive' areas will be raised from $278 million to $1.078 billion.

The government will still be able to meet its election promise of screening agricultural land purchases valued from $15 million and agribusiness purchases from $53 million.

All bids by Chinese state-owned enterprises will be screened regardless of value.

ACTU president Ged Kearney said there was a risk that Australian jobs could be lost as labour mobility between the two countries was made easier.

Australia will provide visas for a range of Chinese contractors and executives for up to four years, and other business visitors for between three and six months.

China will in turn allow certain Australian executives and contractors to stay for up to three years.
