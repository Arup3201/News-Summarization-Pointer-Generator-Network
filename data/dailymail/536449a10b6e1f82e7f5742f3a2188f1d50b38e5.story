A craze for exotic pet newts has spread a deadly infection from Asia to Europe that could threaten to wipe out native amphibian species unless action is taken, scientists have warned.

One of the creatures most at risk from the fungal disease is the great crested newt, already an endangered and protected species in the UK.

The skin-eating fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, is believed to have originated in south-east Asia, where indigenous newts and salamanders are immune to its effects.

One of the types found to be most at risk is the great crested newt (pictured), which is already endangered 

But it is lethal to European and American species, which have evolved no resistance to the disease.

Last year researchers learned the fungus was responsible for a mystery outbreak in the Netherlands that killed off 96 per cent of the country's fire salamanders.

Experts now fear an expanding epidemic that has parallels with the human Ebola crisis.

As with Ebola, the salamander fungus is transmitted by direct contact, and there is a danger of it being exported globally on international flights.

In this case, it is the pet trade that may have to face controls to prevent the infection spreading, say the authors of a new study assessing the threat.

Asian salamanders and newts that could be harbouring the fungus are traded in large numbers around the world.

Between 2001 and 2009, more than 2.3 million Chinese fire belly newts were imported into the US alone. 

Researchers from Imperial College London, who have already identified two cases in Europe, want tighter controls on pet imports to be introduced urgently.
