An 81-year-old grandmother has vowed to carry on skydiving after cheating death when her parachute failed to open.

Daredevil Dilys Price - the world's oldest woman skydiver - nearly died when her parachute became twisted.

She was plummeting to earth when her reserve chute opened just 1,000ft up, saving her life.

Won't be put off: Dilys has said the experience has made her more fearless than ever

Dilys, from Cardiff, said the experience has made her more fearless than ever.

She said: 'It felt terrifying at the time but it has boosted my confidence hugely - it felt like I was cheating death.

'My parachute opened but with lots of twists so I couldn't kick out of it. I went to pull the reserve cord, but because of the twists I couldn't pull it.

'Eventually, with an almighty pull, my rescue parachute came out.

'It was pretty close but it hasn't put me off - I suppose I'm an adventure junkie.'

Mother-of-one Dilys took up skydiving at the age of 54 when she did a parachute jump for charity.

She also has an OBE for her work running a charity called the Touch Trust who provide 'creative movement' programmes for the disabled.

She added: 'My feet are very on the ground but I'm also in the air - my ambitions for the charity are huge but things have to be done properly.

'It's a lot of hard work but sky diving teaches you courage - it's about learning to feel the fear and doing it anyway.'
