As the star of three European Cup wins with Liverpool between 1978 and 1984, Kenny Dalglish knows exactly how difficult it is to maintain success at the very highest level of football.

But, even so, Scotland’s greatest-ever player admits to being genuinely stunned at just how speedily Inter Milan’s players have gone from dipping their toes in the pool of sporting immortality to, in Dalglish’s own words, ‘tumbling down the water slide’ to ignominy and crisis.

Back in 2010, the Italian giants were crowned Champions League winners, swatting away the mighty Barcelona at the peak of their powers on the road to conquering the continent under Jose Mourinho.

Just five years later, however, they are mere Serie A strugglers under the faltering stewardship of former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini. It represents quite a fall for such a proud and famous institution.

Few gave Celtic a prayer of progressing when the teams were paired in the draw for the last-32 of the Europa League. But Ronny Deila’s side have come on leaps and bounds in recent weeks and, ahead of Inter’s visit to Celtic Park for the first leg on Thursday, Dalglish sees no reason why his old team should fear a fixture that conjures up so many happy memories for the Glasgow club.

Inter, naturally, will still be tough to push past if Celtic are to reach the last 16.

But 63-year-old Dalglish feels Deila’s improving side have at least a fighting chance of updating the history books with another famous victory over the club side Jock Stein’s men dispatched in Lisbon in 1967 to become the first British team ever to lift the European Cup.

‘There’s been a demise at Inter Milan,’ said Dalglish.

‘It was only in 2010 that they won the Champions League under Jose Mourinho in Madrid. But it’s been like going down a water slide for them ever since.

‘Five years later and they are lying tenth in Serie A? They haven’t been great.

‘They’re definitely not as strong as they used to be. They’ve brought in Mancini but he’s had one or two setbacks, too. They haven’t done as well as they expected with him coming in but he still knows how to win games. He’s done exceptionally well in the past (at Manchester City and a previous spell at Inter) and it’s still going to be exceptionally difficult for Celtic.

‘But while Celtic had a hard time in the Champions League earlier this season they have stayed patient, they have regrouped and they have done well in the Europa League. They’ve got a chance.

‘In the end, it doesn’t matter what Inter are like back in Italy. It’s about what they are like in the Europa League. But I think it will be a good game, a fantastic occasion and a brilliant atmosphere.’

The first-ever meeting of Celtic and Inter, in Lisbon back in 1967, remains the high water mark in Scottish club football.

After falling behind to Sandro Mazzola’s penalty, Stein’s Celtic – playing what the manager later described as ‘pure, beautiful, inventive football’ – triumphed over the Italian masters of defending with goals from Tommy Gemmell and Stevie Chalmers.

The only other two competitive meetings to date between the Scots and the Italians went less well for the Parkhead club.

In the European Cup semi finals in 1972, the classic Italian Catenaccio prevailed. After two goalless draws, Dixie Deans – on as a substitute for Dalglish - missed the vital penalty in a 5-4 shootout defeat.

It cost Stein and Celtic what would have been a third appearance in the final, against Ajax in Rotterdam, after they were defeated by Feyenoord at the San Siro in 1970’s showpiece.

As a further reminder that the past is a foreign country, on the same night in 1972 that 75,000 were inside Parkhead for the Inter Milan game, 80,000 crammed into Ibrox as Rangers beat Bayern Munich 2-0 on their way to winning the European Cup Winners’ Cup.

If April 19, 1972 made for an unforgettable evening of sport for the city of Glasgow, however, it does not remain uppermost in the memory of Dalglish. He, admittedly, has far happier memories of his own in the competition, including scoring the only goal of the 1978 final for Liverpool against Club Brugge of Belgium at Wembley.

‘The shoot-out at Parkhead in 1972 wasn’t great – but I can’t actually remember anything about the game,’ confessed Dalglish. ‘I wouldn’t know if we hit the post four times or if our goalie was magnificent. I couldn’t tell you a thing!

‘Would I like to see Celtic get revenge for the defeat in 1972? Well, maybe at the time Inter thought that was their revenge for 1967. That had been a real shock for them. They were expected to win easily in Lisbon and they even went 1-0 up before losing.

‘But they got their own back that night in 1972. It’s 1-1 between the teams just now so we’ll keep batting it backwards and forwards. But this match is going to be a massively romantic game with all the memories of 1967. It’s going to be some night alright.’
