Sir Cliff Richard threw a lunch party for friends at his Algarve villa yesterday after a 15-hour round trip to the UK to be interviewed by police over child abuse claims

Sir Cliff Richard threw a lunch party for friends at his Algarve villa yesterday after a 15-hour round trip to the UK to be interviewed by police over child abuse claims.

The pop star was seen smiling and appeared in good spirits after arriving back at his £3million villa in Portugal late on Saturday night.

The 73-year-old was hugged by half a dozen loyal friends who he invited to the 16-acre estate, greeting them with his loyal companion, former priest John McElynn, by his side.

Later, the party left to play tennis in balmy 77F (25C) sunshine.

Just hours earlier, Sir Cliff travelled to Britain on a private jet to attend a police premises in South Yorkshire. He is thought to have left his holiday home in the early hours of Saturday morning for a flight to meet his lawyers before the appointment with detectives.

 The singer voluntarily met officers who interviewed him under caution. He was not arrested or charged over the allegation of sexual assault on a boy under 16 at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham at Sheffield United’s Bramall Lane stadium in 1985.

Afterwards, the star is thought to have taken a private plane direct from Doncaster to Faro, arriving at 9pm on Saturday night.

His spokesman said: ‘Sir Cliff Richard voluntarily met with and was interviewed by members of South Yorkshire Police. He was not arrested or charged. He co-operated fully with officers and answered the questions put to him.

‘Other than restating that this allegation is completely false and that he will continue to co-operate fully with police, it would not be appropriate for Sir Cliff to say anything further at this time.’

South Yorkshire Police confirmed that a 73-year-old man had ‘entered South Yorkshire Police premises by arrangement’.

It comes nine days after a controversial police raid on his £3.1million Berkshire apartment that was broadcast live on the BBC from a helicopter hovering overhead.

The South Yorkshire Police chief in charge of the investigation, David Crompton, and BBC Director General Lord Hall are to appear before MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee next week following an onslaught of criticism about how police deal with the BBC. The coverage of the raid provoked 762 complaints, while human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC questioned the legality of the raid. Sir Cliff had no prior warning of the operation and was in Portugal.

He has since shunned the limelight, cancelling public appearances to remain at his cherished holiday home, which he described as a place to ‘withdraw’ and engage in some ‘mental therapy’ in his autobiography.

Friends have said the committed Christian will draw strength from his faith.

Frank Allen, bass player of 1960s band The Searchers told the Daily Mail: ‘As far as I am concerned he is a moral, upright person who has led an exemplary life.

‘I think that he will turn to his faith to get through this.’ The 70-year-old added: ‘The way the police have behaved and the way it was handled by the BBC is absolutely outrageous and appalling.

‘Police are scared to do anything that does not show them going in for the kill in the light of Jimmy Savile ... But they are just going over the top when the slightest accusation is made. While the BBC are scared about not doing anything because they didn’t do anything before.’   

Actor Christopher Biggins has also released a statement of support.

Fans of the veteran entertainer have showed their support by flocking to buy copies of his 1992 Number 7 hit I Still Believe in You which reached number 57 in the charts yesterday.
