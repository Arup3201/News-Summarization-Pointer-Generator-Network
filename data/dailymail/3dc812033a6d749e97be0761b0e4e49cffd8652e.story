Former colleagues of Stuart Hall have told how the disgraced broadcaster was unable to 'talk to a woman without touching her' and bedded 100 in three months as it emerged police raided a sordid pool party held at the star's home weeks after he abused a young girl.

Linda McDougall has revealed how Hall made her life a misery when they worked together at BBC Manchester in the 1960s while other colleagues have told how he used his fame to lure naive women into bed with him.

Ms McDougall alleges that Hall, who last week pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court to 14 sex attacks that occurred across the 1960s, 70s and 80s, would use any excuse to molest his female colleagues.

New revelations: Linda Mcdougall, pictured left, has told how Stuart Hall, pictured right leaving court, would you any excuse to touch up female colleague while they worked together at BBC Manchester in the 1960s

Ms McDougall told the Sunday Times: 'If you were female, at the slightest opportunity he would put his arms around you and force his body against yours.

'Never a day would go by that he did not touch me. He tried everything. He could stroke your knee or tweak your stocking top, put his hand on your breast or rub your back.

'For me — and my female colleagues — Hall was a damned nuisance. He was offensive and seemed unable to talk to a woman without touching her.'

Her comments come amid revelations that police raided a party at the home of the It's A Knockout presenter in August 1986 after complaints by his neighbours.

Officers discovered the presenter naked in the garden of his £2million mansion as a female guest swam in the nude in his pool.

According to the Sunday Mirror, a friend quoted at the time of the incident said: 'Stuart's mouth dropped open when the policemen walked round to the back of the house. He recovered his cool and covered up with a towel. Everyone was having a great time.'

Officers warned Hall to keep the noise down and left the party. The incident occured just a few weeks after Hall abused an 11-year-old girl.

Ms McDougall, who only spoke out about Hall's behaviour after he admitted his crimes in court last week, said she had no idea he was a paedophile.

She said everyone at the Corporation must have known what was going on but he was 'local hero' and if she complained, she would have been the one who was sacked.

Another colleague, rugby league commentator Eddie Waring, told how Hall once boasted that he had bedded more than 100 women over the course of filming one series of It's A Knockout - which typically took around three months.

Mr Waring, who died in 1986, confided in a friend how he was left stunned by Hall claiming he lured naive girls back to hotel room by telling them he could make them famous.

According to The Sunday People, Mr Waring told the friend: 'I was astonished by what he was telling me.

'If he wasn't trying to bed the show's Score Card girls, he was trying to pull the sexiest girls in the crowd. He told me most were in their late teens.

'He was shameless and once revealed he had slept with 100 girls during one series.'

And another former studio worker has told The Mail on Sunday how floor manager Peter Barlow was nicknamed 'The Pimp' and lured victims for Hall to the BBC’s Manchester studios for fake auditions.

The source claims that the women were lured to a room where Barlow filmed them having sex with the It’s A Knockout host.

The new accusations increase pressure for an inquiry, similar to the Jimmy Savile investigation, into how bosses turned a blind eye while Hall molested girls at BBC studios.

The latest incidents were said to have happened in Hall’s dressing room, next to the office of news editor Tom German and regional manager Ray Colley.

On one occasion it is claimed Hall and Barlow even approached the studio’s production team to have the films processed.

The allegations echo an account of one of his victims, Susan Harrison, who told how when she was 16 the presenter picked her out at a school speech day and persuaded her to visit him at the BBC on the pretext of recording a song. He later got her drunk and molested her in his car.

Detectives believe other BBC staff may have helped Hall, now 83, trick girls seeking fame into visiting him.

Last night the former employee said 
the abuse took place at the studio for regional news programme Look 
North from the late 1970s until the show moved offices in 1981.

The ex-staff member said: ‘It was an 
open secret that Stuart Hall used to film sex videos in his dressing 
room with women procured for him by Peter Barlow. Peter’s nickname was 
The Pimp and he was very close to Stuart – he used to drive him to Look 
North and It’s A Knockout.

‘Peter
would tell women to come into the Look North studio for an audition and
the pair would pretend to film the women while they presented the 
weather forecast.

‘Afterwards they would take  them to Stuart’s dressing room and Peter would film him having sex with them.

‘On one occasion they approached the processing team to process a video but they point-blank refused, they wouldn’t go near it.

‘Women would come by Stuart’s dressing room on a daily basis. 

'Stuart
liked the women aged about 18. He would meet them on It’s A Knockout, 
some of them were score girls, or he also picked up the pageant winners 
from beauty contests he used to judge.

‘Everyone
knew what was going on but no one did anything about it because he was 
the golden boy. As far as the bosses were concerned, as long as he read 
the news he could do what he liked. It was total mismanagement by the 
BBC.

'Next to Stuart’s 
dressing room were the offices of Tom German and Ray Colley. They 
weren’t stupid and it was obvious these women were having sex in 
Stuart’s office. This all needs to be revealed, as it was with Savile.

‘I
felt sick when I found out Stuart had been abusing underage girls. It’s
awful because we used to visit schools around Lancashire and get 
children to take part in cookery competitions.

'It’s awful now to think back and know that probably helped him do those disgusting things.

‘There were odd things about Stuart. We used to collect tins for charity.

'I remember getting some salmon and Stuart kept it because he said the pensioners we were collecting for wouldn’t know what to do with it. It’s little things like that that really tell you about someone’s character.’

MPs and Hall’s victims have called on the BBC to investigate his behaviour after he admitted assaulting 13 girls, the youngest of whom was nine, between 1967 and 1986.

In the aftermath of his guilty pleas, it emerged the married father of two told staff that girls he took to his dressing room were his ‘nieces’.

Peter Barlow died aged 86 in 2007 and Tom German died aged 66 in 1992.

When approached by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Colley, 83, said: ‘While Stuart Hall is awaiting sentence it would be inappropriate to comment.’

The BBC has no plans to set up a separate inquiry into Hall, saying it has passed any information on to the Dame Janet Smith Review, which is looking at practices at the BBC during the years of Savile’s abuse.

However, last night Conservative MP Rob Wilson said: ‘My gut instinct is the BBC are not using the Smith Review to get to the truth and are instead using it to do the minimum necessary to carry on as before.’

A spokesman for The National Association for People Abused in Childhood said: ‘It’s disgusting the BBC gave Hall unfettered opportunities to carry out his abuse.

‘The BBC owes it to his victims to open a new inquiry that can scrutinise his behaviour and the colleagues who may have helped him.’

Hall and the BBC are facing potential compensation payouts after six victims contacted solicitor Alan Collins, a partner at the law firm Pannone who is also pursuing the BBC over the Savile scandal.

The BBC said: ‘All allegations that have been made to the BBC in relation to Stuart Hall have been passed on to the police or the Dame Janet Smith Review.’
