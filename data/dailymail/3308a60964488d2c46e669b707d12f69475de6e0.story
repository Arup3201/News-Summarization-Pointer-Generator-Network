Train drivers have been ordered not to stop at the station nearest to the Olympic Park – because it is too hot.

The Greater Anglia rail company says soaring temperatures mean it is not safe for trains to travel as quickly as usual.

So, to minimise delays, it has ordered drivers to go straight through Stratford – the main gateway to the Olympics.

Can't handle the heat: Train services were slowed down or cancelled because of the soaring temperatures

Too warm a welcome: The sun meant that trains did not stop at Stratford today

The company said yesterday that its 
overhead cables, which date back to the 1950s and are in desperate need 
of upgrading, cannot cope with trains travelling at normal speeds if the
 temperature is more than 30C (86F).

Network Rail said last night that the 
ageing cables were in the process of being updated. A spokesman 
apologised for any disruption and stressed that the vast majority of 
services would still run to Stratford.

Greater Anglia confirmed that at least
 nine services on the Norwich to Liverpool Street service would not stop
 at Stratford, while there would also be revisions and cancellations 
affecting trains headed for Colchester.

A spokesman said: ‘There are 
some revisions in place to our mainline timetable. We are working with 
Network Rail to minimise the disruption for our customers.’

Temperatures are predicted to drop 
before the opening ceremony on Friday. But fears are growing that 
London’s antiquated transport system will cause chaos for millions 
travelling to the Games.

The network was widely declared to have failed 
its first ‘test run’ for the Olympics on Monday night.

As 40,000 spectators flocked to the 
Olympic Park for the opening ceremony rehearsal, two key routes to the 
stadium were suspended.

The Central Line was closed for two 
hours by a power cut, while the North London line closed for an hour 
after a track buckled in the heat. Many performers were late as a 
result.

Excuse: Greater Anglia trains said the problems were down to older sections of overhead lines expanding and sagging in high temperatures

Graduate Sam Batt, 22, of Ealing, West
 London, said he left home at 4.30pm but did not arrive at the stadium 
until about 8.10pm – missing the first 40 minutes.

After the ceremony, spectators were 
forced to queue for nearly an hour and a half just to get into Stratford
 tube station because it was so overcrowded. Many did not get home until
 the early hours.

There were similar problems on the 
Underground last week, when a fault on another key Olympic route – the 
Jubilee Line – meant trains were suspended and some passengers stuck 
inside boiling hot carriages for up to 25 minutes.

And those who have chosen to travel by
 road have fared even worse, with athletes reporting that it has taken 
up to five hours to get from Heathrow to the Olympic Village by bus.

Signs intended to welcome Arabic visitors to the Olympics are ‘completely incoherent’.

The huge banners are hung in the 
shopping centre which borders the Olympic Park, Westfield Stratford. But
 the Council for Arab-British Understanding said the words were back to 
front and not joined up properly.

It was the equivalent of an English 
language sign intending to say ‘welcome to London’, instead saying ‘N O D
 N O L O T E M O C L E W’. Westfield Stratford apologised and said it 
would replace the posters.
