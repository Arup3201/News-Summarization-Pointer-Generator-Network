The recession has not only left many Britons worse off financially, it has also damaged their sex lives, according to a survey.

It says the average Briton has sex four times a month, compared with seven in 2008 when the years of economic boom gave way to bust.

And one in three Britons now does not have sex at all in a typical month.

The survey suggests that women are increasingly getting their thrills from erotic literature while men are turning to online porn

This is a significant increase – by eight percentage points – since 2008, says the poll of more than 1,000 adults published yesterday.

The decrease in regularity of having sex may be one of the reasons why the proportion of Britons saying they are satisfied with their sex life – 63 per cent – has decreased considerably since 2008, when 76 per cent were content.

It also seems that the tougher economic times may have had an impact on men’s self-confidence.

In 2008 more than half of the men questioned for the poll, carried out by The Observer, said they rated themselves above average in the bedroom. Today, only a third can claim the same confidence. The survey suggests that women are increasingly getting their thrills from erotic literature while men are turning to online porn.

Some 53 per cent of women admitted to reading erotic novels such as Fifty Shades of Grey, compared with just 36 per cent of men.

Women may turn to fiction but 76 per cent of men surveyed said they had watched pornography online compared with 36 per cent of the opposite sex.

The survey was carried out by Opinium Research which said it interviewed a sample of 1,052 UK adults between July 8 and 14, 2014, via an online methodology, ensuring absolute anonymity.

It found that 66 per cent of women are satisfied with their sex life, compared with 60 per cent of men.

And satisfaction levels are higher for those in a relationship than singles, but around one in four of those in a stable relationship report being dissatisfied with their sex life.
