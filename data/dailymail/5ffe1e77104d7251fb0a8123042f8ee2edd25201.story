'Building bridges': German Foreign Minster Guido Westerwelle (right)

Germany launched an extraordinary charm offensive to try to get Britain back to the EU negotiating table last night despite George Osborne’s refusal to contribute billions to a Brussels begging bowl.

Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, used a visit to London to extend an olive branch, lavishing praise on the UK as an ‘indispensable partner’ and promising a ‘hands-off’ approach to our financial services industry.

There are increasing signs Germany is prepared to go behind France’s back and contemplate giving David Cameron the special protections for the City of London that were refused at a crunch summit this month, prompting the Prime Minister to veto an EU-wide power-sharing treaty.

Mr Westerwelle, speaking alongside Foreign Secretary William Hague, promised a prosperous future for the City. He said Germany wanted the EU’s next steps to involve all 27 member states, adding: ‘My main message is for the British people – you can count on us, and we can count on you.

‘There is no doubt that we want to make the next steps in the EU together as 27. I am here to show you that we are willing to build bridges over troubled water.’

The remarks about ‘building bridges’ were in stark contrast to days of aggressive rhetoric from the French, who appear keen to see Britain exit the EU altogether.

Ministers were privately appalled by suggestions from France, which looks likely to lose its gold-plated credit rating within weeks, that the UK should be downgraded first.

The Chancellor risked heightening tensions last night as he confirmed Britain will not sign up to a 200billion-euro package of European loans to the International Monetary Fund, the world’s economic rescue service.

Mr Osborne is refusing to expose more British taxpayers’ cash through the IMF to a eurozone bailout package, despite suggestions that we should contribute about £25billion.

In a conference call with 26 other EU finance ministers, Mr Osborne repeated the Government’s position that the UK is prepared to increase contributions by up to £10billion, but only when EU leaders boost their own bailout fund and not for any scheme specifically for the single currency.

‘The UK has always been willing to consider further resources for the IMF, but for its global role and as part of a global agreement,’ a Treasury spokesman said.

A Government source said no one in Europe should be surprised at Britain’s stance, which had been clear for several weeks. ‘It’s called “doing what you say you’re going to do”. Get used to it,’ the source said.

Conciliatory plea: German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told the press conference: 'My main message is for the British people - you can count on us, and we count on you'

Eurozone countries appear to have cobbled together their own 150billion-euro boost for IMF resources – nowhere near enough to bail out Italy, Spain or other debt-stricken economies in peril.

Warning: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi openly warned of 
the risk of currency collapse for the first time in an interview yesterday

To the frustration of British officials, the European Central Bank again rejected suggestions that it should embark on a programme of quantitative easing – effectively printing money – in order to help governments repay their debts.

The bank has refused to do so, insisting it is up to national governments to put their houses in order.

ECB president Mario Draghi said EU rules ‘forbid monetary financing of states’ by the central bank.

A report from a key UN body yesterday warned the world is heading for a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The UN Commission for Trade and Development issued the strongest warning yet from a major international organisation.

It said: ‘Unless there is a rapid policy turnaround, the world is in danger of repeating the mistakes of the 1930s.

In today’s highly integrated global economy, the contractionary contagion will affect all countries. Emerging and developing economies need to prepare contingency plans.’

Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the IMF, warned the EU’s firewall to staunch the spread of the crisis ‘doesn’t really exist’.

attraction in Hertfordshire yesterday, warned that he euro is unlikely to

Crisis talks: George Osborne will use a teleconference today to discuss boosting the world's economic rescue service

A 500billion euro European Stability 
Mechanism would only be operational in months when ‘the question is a 
question of weeks’, he added.

‘It appears today as a debt crisis. More than that, it is a growth crisis.

'Behind the growth crisis is a leadership crisis.

'The problem is they don’t have exactly the same view and I’m not quite sure that [Angela] Merkel and [Nicolas] Sarkozy clearly understand each other. The problem is they are still in denial.’

Italy, which has a massive national debt that has prompted market turmoil in recent weeks, was last night reported to have committed 23 billion euros to the IMF scheme.

There were claims the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), an existing EU bailout fund, may have to lend money to Italy so it can give money to the IMF which it in turn will give to EFSF and to Italy.

■ A senior Church of England bishop warned yesterday against British isolation from Europe.

The Bishop of Guildford, the Right Reverend Christopher Hill, who speaks for his colleagues on EU matters in the House of Lords, intervened in the row following followed David Cameron’s veto of the new EU treaty this month.

He said: ‘It will be disastrous if we were actually isolated from the rest of Europe, economically and in terms of international relations.’

He added: The structures need reform and accountability, but you don’t do that by stepping out.’

■ Business leaders claim millions of British jobs will be lost if the country does not fight to keep its place as a key player in Europe.

A group of tycoons and entrepreneurs, including Sir Richard Branson, have written an open letter to the Government urging David Cameron to ‘re-engage in the decision-making process in Europe’.

Signatories say at least three million could find themselves unemployed if Britain continues to isolate itself from the EU.

Co-ordinated by the lobby group Business for New Europe, the letter will put extra pressure on Mr Cameron at a time when he stands accused of trying to appease Europhile party members.
