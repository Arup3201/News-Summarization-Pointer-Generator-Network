Smothering yourself in horse manure might not sound like fun for most of us.

But for these eco-beauties, anything done in the name of promoting recycling is clearly enjoyable - despite its rather pongy nature. 

After the huge success of the first Ladies of Manure calendar, a green charity has just released the 2015 edition - and here is a sneak peek at some of the pictures.

Who needs a bra when you have manure? This young lady looks ecstatic to have her breasts covered in poo. She is posing for the 2015 edition of the Ladies of Manure calendar, which promotes the benefits of recycling

It's raining... poo. Clad only in her underwear this woman doesn't seem to mind the rather smelly hail 

The latest fad in foot care: A long soak in a pile of manure will soften even the most stubborn callouses 

The 12 curvaceous models took part in the shoot to promote the benefits of recycling.

The raunchy calendar features sexy women touching poop, playing with dung and even bathing in vast quantities of manure. 

The scatological pin ups created the calendar with the Fertile Earth Foundation, which promotes environmental awareness through means of natural waste. 

The group sought funding via a Kickstarter Campaign to get the calendars finished, printed and distributed. 

The first calendar was released in 2013 and received worldwide media attention. 

Now the girls hope to emulate their success and raise greater awareness by posing in even more manure. 

The calendar was shot by Terribly Girly studio.
