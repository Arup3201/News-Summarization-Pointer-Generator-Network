His place in Van Gaal’s team on Saturday will go to Ashley Young who has impressed the Dutch coach at left wing back during pre-season.

Meanwhile, according to reports in Norway, United have released Danish goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard.

Sunnmorsposten, a newspaper based in Alesund where Lindegaard played before joining United in 2010, reported that the player had been let go by the Old Trafford club and that his agent, Michael Stensgaard, would be making a statement.

‘Spread your wings and fly #mufc #fly #manchesterunited,’ tweeted the 30-year-old Lindegaard, seemingly confirming his imminent exit from the club.

United have announced that exciting Belgian Adnan Januzaj will wear the No 11 shirt this season following Ryan Giggs’ retirement. Shaw will wear the No 3 jersey.
