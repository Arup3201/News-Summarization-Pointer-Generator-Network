Two men face charges 
in the death of a motorcyclist who ran into a rope and chain the men had
 allegedly stretched across a southwestern Colorado highway to retrieve 
an elk carcass, authorities said Friday.

Trever
 Rawson, 34, of Fountain died Oct. 12 when he struck the chest-high line
 across Colorado 92 in Montrose County, the Colorado State Patrol said 
in a news release.

An indictment was returned 
April 10. The reason for the delay in bringing charges was not clear, 
and authorities declined to discuss the case Friday.

The
 charges allege Mark Valdez, 47, of Delta and Kevin Keener, 43, of Anton
 had attached the line to a pickup on one side of the road and to the 
elk on the other and were dragging the elk toward the road when Rawson 
was killed.

Neither man immediately returned phone messages Friday.

The
 indictment says Valdez frantically waved at Rawson from the pickup when
 he saw him approach, the Montrose Daily Press reported.

The impact threw Rawson from the motorcycle and knocked off his helmet, authorities said. He died at the scene.

The
 indictment alleges that neither Valdez nor Keener called 911 but says a
 motorist who came upon the scene did.

The indictment also alleges that 
Valdez told a teenager who was helping retrieve the elk not to tell 
anyone what happened.

Valdez and Keener both 
face charges of vehicular homicide, criminally negligent homicide, 
manslaughter, accessory to a crime and reckless endangerment.

Valdez 
also faces charges of failing to render aid after a fatal accident and 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

The indictment alleges Valdez gave the teen alcohol and marijuana.

Both
 men also face hunting-related charges including willful destruction of 
big game wildlife and wasting big game wildlife.

The indictment says the
 men had killed two elk, including the one being dragged, when Rawson 
was killed.

It was not clear if the rope and chain that Rawson struck were linked end-to-end or intertwined.
