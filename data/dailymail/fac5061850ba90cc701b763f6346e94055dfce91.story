A boy who posed with a cockatoo for his senior yearbook picture has expressed his surprise that the school got in a flap about it – and banned the photograph.

Officials at Glens Falls High School in New York told 17-year-old Ben Brodeur that allowing animal-themed photographs could open the floodgates for incendiary poses, such as students making rude gestures or gang signs.

Brodeur, however, thought that the school was over-reacting.

Officials at Glens Falls High School in New York told 17-year-old Ben Brodeur that allowing animal-themed photographs in the yearbook could escalate into something incendiary

The superintendent of the school (pictured), Paul Jenkins, said that if parents want to publish a less formal photograph of their child in the yearbook they can pay for it to appear in the back

He told the Glens Falls Post-Star: 'I think that's kind of a far stretch.'

Brodeur's family fosters and cares for around 22 rescued exotic birds, including parakeets and macaws, which they offer up for adoption after rehabilitating them.

'Parrots are a big part of my life and I wanted to be remembered that way,' Brodeur said.

The cockatoo he posed with is special, he said, because it was his first umbrella cockatoo.

'He is just a big sweetheart. He'll cuddle,' he added.

He has now started a petition to have the school's decision reversed.

The school's superintendent Paul Jenkins said that if parents want to publish a less formal photograph of their child in the yearbook they can pay for it to appear in the back, as an advertisement.

New York's Schenectady High School banned senior Draven Rodriguez from appearing in his yearbook portrait section posing with his cat, framed by lasers

'If there was no option for parents, I would say there may be a valid point,' he said. 

It follows New York's Schenectady High School banning senior Draven Rodriguez from appearing in his yearbook portrait section posing with his cat, framed by lasers.

Rodriguez, 16, started an online petition to support his picture, and now he's been offered a spot on the principal's page with administrator Diane Wilkinson and her mixed chihuahua, Vivienne.
