Iraq War veteran Tomas Young said today he does not harbor any personal resentment against former President George Bush despite being an outspoken anti-war activist who blamed Bush's administration for the war on Iraq.

Young spoke from his hospice bed with his wife Claudia by his side on the same day the First Families - both past and present - gathered to honor Bush's presidency at the opening of a library in his name in Dallas.

He said: 'I'm not angry at George Bush because he seems like a relatively good 
guy. I think he was 
manipulated by Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, and 
from what I hear he is divorced from them.'

For nearly a decade, 
Young has been living in chronic pain after being paralyzed by a 
sniper's bullet four days into his first assignment in the Middle East.

He decided to enlist for the army after watching Bush stand on the rubble of the Twin Towers in the wake of 9/11 and encourage young people to pledge to go after those responsible.

Since then, the 33-year-old has rallied against war and a documentary was made about his worsening condition. Earlier this year he made the decision that he would simply refuse nourishment and wait to die as he does not want to suffer any more. 

He told the Huffington Post today that he believes that Bush 'realized that [Cheney, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz] bamboozled him, and he wanted to be liked and this wasn't his nature.'

Young famously wrote an open letter to Bush and Cheney and published it on the tenth anniversary of the conflict, chastising them for going to war on Iraq when the country had nothing to do with the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

He said: 'On every level - moral, strategic, 
military and economic - Iraq was a failure. And it was you, Mr Bush and 
Mr Cheney, who started this war. It is you who should pay the 
consequences.

'My day of reckoning is upon me. Yours will come. I hope you will be put
on trial. But mostly I hope, for your sakes, that you find the moral 
courage to face what you have done to me and to many, many others who 
deserved to live.

'I hope that before your time on earth ends, as mine is
now ending, you will find the strength of character to stand before the
American public and the world, and in particular the Iraqi people, and 
beg for forgiveness.'

Asked today if he would like to see the letter in the Bush library, he said: 'I think it'd be a great thing for it to 
be in the library but I doubt they'll put it in there because it 
reflects the truth that they don't want to tell.'

Two days after the September 11 
attacks, Mr Young, from Kansas City, Oklahoma, joined the Army to 
serve his country in a time of chaos.

In 2004, Mr Young was sent to Sadr City, Iraq. Four days after being deployed, he was shot by a sniper.

He was hit in the collarbone on April 4 while riding in an unarmored Humvee and was instantly paralyzed.

The
unconscious private was transferred to the Walter Reed Army Medical 
Center outside of Washington, D.C., by way of Kuwait and Germany.

Speaking with the Kansas City Star, Young said that his wife, Claudia Cuellar understands and supports his decision to die.

‘I’m sick and tired of being sick 
and tired,’ he explained to the paper, adding that his medications 
frequently leave him lethargic and nauseated.’

Mr Young was fitted with a colostomy bag meaning that he 
can no longer eat solid foods. His wife doesn’t cook anymore so as to 
help her husband not to think about food.

Now in hospice care, Young says his mind is clear.
