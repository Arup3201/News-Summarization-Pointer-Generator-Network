A Queensland newsreader has apologised for causing offence when he shut down a viewer's ice bucket challenge on-air, insisting he didn't want to see the viral charity resemble the online drinking game 'neknominate'.

Lincoln Humphries, a presenter for WIN Television on the Sunshine Coast, garnered widespread attention after saying 'everyone, everywhere' should give to other charities instead of following the ice bucket sensation, which raises awareness for ALS - a motor neurone disease (MND).

He called for people to donate blood and give to a range of worthy causes, explaining his reasons for not partaking in the ice bucket challenge, before putting on sunglasses, crossing his arms and saying: 'Deal with it'.

And although his segment has received some praise, other viewers weren't too impressed - prompting the newsreader to issue a public apology.

'I support Project ALS to the utmost extent; and applaud their ingenious methods of spreading awareness and raising an immense amount of charitable funds for a worthy cause.'

'(But) My gripe, and it is expressly my own, is the ice bucket challenge's departure from an awareness raising, charitable gem of an idea, to becoming the next 'neknominate'.

The neknominate online drinking game that swept across social media involved people nominating others to film themselves sculling alcohol before nominating others to do the same.

He said the segment which never went to air was a response to a nomination shared between him and a friend on Facebook.

'The segment never went to air in any form on television,' he said.

'It was a personal response to an ice bucket challenge which I shared on my personal wall and that of my mate.'

Mr Humphries, a Sunshine Coast sports presenter, became an overnight sensation when he declined the nomination and a video of his segment spread online.

In the tirade he told 'everyone, everywhere' to stop 'pouring fresh water' over their head and 'wasting ice'.

He encouraged people to show their support for The Red Cross and Cancer Council, instead.

'Ice is for keeping fresh produce fresh, beers cold and your nipples hard,' he said.

He also said charity was not about 'putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of ice and water.'

Mr Humphries said he was 'pushing for a national, annual MND day'  to ensure the cause lasts.

'The fundraising has been nothing short of astounding,' he said.

'But we need to make sure it's something with longevity and real meaning.'

He criticised people who poured ice and water over their head because it was a waste of the resource other countries are short on

He suggested a number of other charities as alternatives to the ALS challenge

He said donating a day to the cause, like Daffodil Day which he is a strong supporter of, would help to maintain its longevity.

'(It's) to ensure this isn't forgotten before the ice melts, so to speak, like so many Internet fads before it,' he said.

It comes as a string of celebrities, both in Australia and around the world, have posted videos on social media showing their support for the ALS Project.

Since the ice bucket challenge went viral earlier this month, everyone from Oprah Wingrey to Iggy Azalea and  have taken part in the stunt.

Shane Warne, Kylie Minogue, Jessica Mauboy and Liam Hemsworth have been added to the list of homegrown Australian celebrities to show their support.
