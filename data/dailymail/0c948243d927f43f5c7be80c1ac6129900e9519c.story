However, potential new owners would not have to worry about the operation of the lighthouse, complete with a 1,000-watt lamp which shines for nine seconds out of every ten, 24 hours a day, as it is leased back to lighthouse authority Trinity House.

With a total of nine bedrooms, the unusual property also offers views across the Irish Sea, where porpoises, dolphins and seals can often be seen frolicking from the headland.

Both the lighthouse and surrounding headland, including the main residence, two holiday cottages and the freehold of the lighthouse tower, have been put up for sale by the current owners following an extensive £700,000 renovation, with the holiday properties bringing in around £42,000 per year.

A lighthouse station was first proposed for the site in Llaneilian in 1766, so that ships heading for Liverpool could pick up pilots to help guide them around the coastline.

The pilots initially used a farmhouse as their lookout post, before building a tower where two oil lamps could shine out to sea in two directions using reflectors.

The current lighthouse, which is fully automated and backed up by standby generators, was built in 1835 by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board at a cost £1,165, with Trinity House assuming responsibility for it in 1973.

It's first keeper, Captain Robert Beaver, was formerly a pirate before taking up his post at the lighthouse, and is buried in nearby Llaneilian churchyard.

Matthew James, Head of Communications at Rightmove, said: 'It's not every day you get the chance to buy a lighthouse on Rightmove.

'Though having said that, every week there are unique properties listed on the site that get people talking, from castles and multi-million pound mansions to old churches and windmills.

'While many people nowadays look for homes with the latest technology or a blank canvas to work from, luckily for sellers there are plenty of others who seek out something with a bit more character.'

Fairytale: The property is set within a courtyard surrounded by castle-style walls

Character: The lighthouse's first keeper Captain Robert Beaver, was formerly a pirate before taking up his post
