A multimillionaire CEO who was caught repeatedly kicking a puppy on camera has resigned from his food service company after it was boycotted by customers.

Surveillance cameras in the elevator of a Vancouver apartment building filmed Des Hague kicking the one-year-old Doberman pinscher, Sade, in the stomach in July.

On Tuesday it emerged that Hague had resigned from Centerplate Inc., a $6 billion-dollar company that provides snacks at sports and entertainment arenas across the U.S., including Providence Park in Portland, the Superdome in New Orleans and the Javits Center in New York City 

After the video emerged, sports teams pressured Centerplate to make a decision about Hague and urged fans to boycott the concession stands until he was removed,The Oregonian reported.

Ousted: Des Hague has resigned from his CEO role at Centerplate, Inc., which provides snacks at sports and entertainment arenas across the U.S. It comes after he was caught on camera kicking a dog

Instead of stepping down, Hague initially agreed to attend counseling to address his anger management issues - but fans continued to demand his firing.

Centerplate's board of directors have now played ball, announcing that they have replaced Hague, Global News reported.

'We want to reiterate that we do not condone nor would we ever overlook the abuse of animals,' Centerplate board chairman Joe O'Donnell said in a statement.

'Following an extended review of the incident involving Mr. Hague, I'd like to apologize for the distress that this situation has cause for so many; but also thank our employees, clients and guests who expressed their feelings about this incident. 

Disturbing: The footage showed Hague kicking a friend's Doberman pinscher in an elevator in July

Cruel: Another image from the footage shows him yanking the dog off the ground by its leash

'Their voices helped us to frame our deliberations during this very unusual and unfortunate set of circumstances.' 

Chris Verros, the company's chief operating officer since 2010, will now be acting president and chief executive.

The shocking video showed Hague kicking the dog as it cowered in the elevator before yanking its leash and swinging it around, in scenes that are hard to watch.

After the video emerged Hague, who had been CEO of the company since 2009, said the dog belonged to a friend and apologized for his actions.

'This incident is completely and utterly out of character and I am ashamed and deeply embarrassed,' he said in a statement.

He blamed his outburst on 'a minor frustration' with the dog.

Terrified: The dog is seen cowering from Hague as he repeatedly kicks him. Hague later apologized for the outburst and vowed to donate money to animal charities - but sports fans demanded he stepped down

'Unfortunately, I acted inappropriately, and I am deeply sorry for that and am very grateful that no harm was caused to the animal,' he said. 

Following the July incident, the BC SPCA removed the dog and Hague still faces the possibility of criminal charges, the Oregonian reported. 

The company has more than 30,000 employees and clients, including the Superdome in New Orleans, the Javits Center in New York City and college sports arenas like Notre Dame.

Des Hague had been at the top for Centerplate since 2009. He is a veteran of the food-service industry having held senior positions at IHOP, Safeway and Taco Bell, according toFortune.
