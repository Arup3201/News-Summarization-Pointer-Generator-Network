Bryan Patrick Miller has been arrested by police in connection with the shockingly brutal 20-year-old murders of two young in 1992 and 1993

Police investigating the cold case murders of two women in Arizona have arrested a man more than 20 years after their  bodies were found in a canal.

Angela Brosso, 22, and 17-year-old Melanie Bernas disappeared 11 months apart while riding their bikes through Phoenix. 

Miss Brosso was decapitated, with her head found in the nearby canal where Miss Bernas's body was later discovered.

Investigators took six months to link the killings through forensic evidence and failed to make a breakthrough until yesterday when they arrested Bryan Patrick Miller, 42, on suspicion of murder.

Police said they tied the case to Miller through DNA, but refused to say how they obtained the sample.

Miller's family home near North Mountain Park was illuminated by industrial lights last night as officers combed the property, taking away an old bicycle from a shed.

Neither of the women's bikes - Brosso's purple, 21-speed Diamondback nor Bernas's green SPC Hardrock Sport - has ever been found, suggesting the killer may have kept them as trophies.

Sgt Trent Crump, a Phoenix police spokesman, said it wasn't immediately clear if the one found at the Miller family home belonged to either victim, it was reported by The Arizona Republic.

According to Miller's Facebook page he is a father of one, works as a driver for Amazon, likes Zombie films and conventions and recently embarked on a relationship.

A recent posting read: 'I have had to deal with some if the worst rejections you can imagine and some that were exceptionally cruel.. I am awkward when it comes to a lot of social aspects of my life'.

Another in October last year read: 'My birthday is on friday and normally I dread my birthday because of well "reasons", but this year I have decided to celebrate my birthday the entire month of October. Seeing friends, concerts, food, car-related events, and just trying to enjoy things more, and this weekend I have the zombie walk and an extra day off and then next week is Halloween and Fearcon.'

Miss Brosso's headless body was found shortly after she went missing in November 1992 and her head was discovered 11 days later in the Arizona Canal. 

Miss Bernas became the killer's next victim in September 1993 when he struck while she was riding her bike near the same canal.

Her body was found floating in the water close to the Black Canyon Freeway, with her turquoise bodysuit discovered nearby.

Police said the killer probably had special military training due to the speed and brutality of the women's executions. 

'It's the most brutal murder we've probably ever had,' said William Schira, a Phoenix detective on the cold-case squad said in 2012.

Phoenix police and the Cold Case Homicide Unit launched a fresh appeal for information that year, hoping someone who lived in the area may recall anything unusual among their neighbours.

'We're calling on the public who lived in that area at the time to think: 'Who had specialized training and might have seemed a little off?',' said Phoenix police Sgt Troy Hillman at the time.

It is not known whether Miller's arrest was made as a result of that inquiry.

Crime scene investigators admit they were traumatized by the sheer brutality of the murders. 'It's the most brutal murder we've probably ever had,' said William Schira, a Phoenix detective on the cold-case squad
