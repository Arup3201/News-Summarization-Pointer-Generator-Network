A fire chief who swapped explicit pornographic pictures of children online is still entitled to a £150,000 pension payout.

William Wyllie, 49, was suspended from his £46,900 job as a manager by Cumbria Fire Service after his arrest in October 2011.

The married father had been leading a bizarre double life, swapping indecent images of children and cruising gay dating websites.

He protested his innocence, which 
meant he could legally claim his full pay throughout his suspension, and
even received a pay increase when he was promoted.

However, he dramatically went on to admit six child porn charges and was given a three-year community order.

Lancaster Crown Court heard that 
Wyllie, of Barrow, sent indecent images of children to London-based 
prolific HIV-positive paedophile Steven King, who was jailed in 2011 for
four years for arranging to have sex with children as young as five.

As a result of the King investigation, Wyllie’s home and car were searched and laptops, mobile phones and sim cards were seized.

He initially denied nine charges relating to distributing and encouraging the making of indecent images of children.

The jury were told Wyllie claimed the material had been sent by a malicious hacker attempting to ‘get him in trouble’.

But on the second day of his trial he 
admitted three charges of sending indecent images of children, two 
offences of sending indecent moving images of children and one charge of
publishing an obscene article.

He was sentenced to a three-year 
community order, which will involve three years’ supervision and a sex 
offender treatment programme.

He was also put on the sex offenders’ 
register for five years and subject to a sexual offences prevention 
order for the same period.

Wyllie started working for Cumbria 
Fire and Rescue Service in 2005 after moving from Greenock in 
Strathclyde where he was working as a fireman.

He worked across Cumbria including a stint in Penrith.

Cumbria County Council said he was given his promotion as part of a force-wide restructuring programme.

Wyllie, who once worked as a 
policeman, was working as a temporary group manager when he was 
suspended and was given an incremental pay increase when his title was 
made permanent.

Fire service sources blasted Wyllie’s entitlement, labelling him a ‘crafty, evil man’ and said he didn’t deserve the money.

TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Matthew Sinclair said: 'The news of his £150,000 pay-off just adds insult to injury.

'It is this kind of eye-watering golden goodbye that is unjustifiable in normal circumstances.

'When the recipient’s retirement has been forced by a serious criminal conviction, it is nothing short of disgusting.'

Fire Brigade Union secretary John Duffy said: 'An individual’s pension is not for comment. It is a pension he is entitled to.'
