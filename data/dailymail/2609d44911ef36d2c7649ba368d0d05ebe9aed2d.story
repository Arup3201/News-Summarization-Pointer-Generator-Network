Britain's potholed road network could be 'brought to its knees' by another spate of bad weather, council transport bosses warned today.

They said swathes of local roads could become unusable if there was more flooding or another severe winter.

The Local Government Association warned of a £10.5billion repairs backlog and a 'spiral of decline'. One in five roads is now classed as being in a 'poor condition'.

Swathes of local roads could become unusable if there was more flooding or another severe winter, the Local Government Association has said

The LGA said: 'Further severe weather could now lead to a tipping point in many areas where roads will become so damaged they will have to close.

'Without extra government funding to pay for desperately needed resurfacing more severe weather could bring parts of the country to its knees.'

The LGA said recent freezing weather and flooding has caused an estimated £1billion of damage throughout the country.

Last year council highway teams fixed 2.2million potholes – 500,000 more than the year before – but despite these efforts the LGA said the backlog of repairs continues to grow.

It said crumbling carriageways are costing small businesses £5billion a year and some local roads were at risk of closure.

The LGA has written to Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, asking him to provide more funding 'to turn around the spiralling decline'.

Bad weather conditions have affectid roads around Britain and an increasing amount of pot-holes appear to be on the roads

Peter Box, chairman of the LGA's economy and transport board, said: 'The case for proper funding to resurface our roads is a no-brainer.

'The short-termist approach  of successive governments of underfunding local road maintenance, coupled with severe weather over recent years, has taken its toll.

'Now we're facing unprecedented budget cuts, things are only getting worse – something plain for all drivers to see.'

He added: 'Despite their best efforts, many councils are trapped in a false economy of reactive repairs while managing a spiralling compensation bill, all the time praying it doesn't flood or freeze.

'Government cutting funding for roads is a very high-risk strategy as the longer you keep simply patching up a deteriorating surface, the more vulnerable it becomes to severe weather.

'Unless something changes, we risk swathes of Britain's road network becoming dangerously strewn with potholes or collapsing completely.'

A recent AA survey revealed that across Britain motorists face an average of 6.25 potholes per mile.

AA president Edmund King said: 'Although patching up the roads after last winter's ravages has brought some improvement, their condition is on a knife-edge and drivers are still likely to have to dodge potholes.'

Transport Minister Norman Baker said the Government was providing councils with more than £3.4billion between 2011 to 2015 to maintain their highways.

He said it was also working with the sector and sponsoring a £6million Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme.

A report by the RAC last week said a 'plague' of potholes combined with soaring petrol prices and motoring taxes meant Britain's drivers were at their most miserable for 25 years.
