Among groups that have expressed an interest in changing the wedding laws is British Naturism, the organisation that represent naturists and campaigns to combat prejudice against outdoor nudism 

Couples may be allowed to get married naked in naturist weddings under a rethink of marriage law ordered by ministers.

The prospect of brides walking down the aisle of Waitrose rather than one in a church will also be on the cards in a full-scale inquiry into how and where weddings should be staged.

The move to reform wedding law follows David Cameron’s introduction of same-sex marriage.

The 2013 legislation that allowed gay weddings also said the Government would examine changes to the way marriages are solemnised.

As a result, the wedding law review, ordered by ministers to start this week, will look at sweeping reforms which could allow weddings in the open air or in people’s homes and gardens.

It will explore whether weddings may be conducted by non-religious organisations from humanists to political pressure groups.

A paper published yesterday by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling confirmed that among groups that have expressed an interest in changing the wedding laws is British Naturism, the organisation that represent naturists and campaigns to combat prejudice against outdoor nudism.

It said naturists could qualify to conduct weddings if the rules were changed.

And, the paper said, there was concern that liberalising wedding law could bring in commercial competition, with rival private wedding companies vying to attract the custom of brides and grooms, and even supermarkets might be turned into venues for couples to take their vows.

That would mean Tesco could open wedding parlours alongside its pharmacies and banks, and the Co-op could expand its funeral services into an all-round ‘match and despatch’ operation.

Independent marriage support groups said it was important that people take their weddings seriously wherever they are held.

Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation, which campaigns to promote marriage, said: ‘I have no objection to people getting married jumping out of an aeroplane or on a beach as long as they mean it and the marriage is properly registered.

‘But some of these ideas are just silly. I hope there will be guidance for the best man at a nude wedding on where to keep the ring.’

At the moment wedding law allows couples to have a traditional wedding in church, under rules set by the Church of England and other churches with the right to conduct the ceremonies, or a civil wedding in a register office or ‘approved premises’.

Approved premises, which include stately homes, hotels and sports ground entertainment suites, have proved highly popular since they were introduced in the 1990s.

Only Jews and Quakers are allowed to marry in their own homes, under laws from 1753 which released them from the requirement to be married by the Church of England.

 

Tony Blair’s government tried to introduce a law to allow people to get married anywhere they liked in 2000, but dropped the idea in the face of the complications involved.

The 2013 Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act said ministers would review whether ‘non-religious belief organisations’, like humanists, should also be able to conduct weddings.

The consultation response from the Ministry of Justice yesterday said that humanists were anxious to hold weddings in the open air or at places couples find ‘meaningful’, which could mean a preferred holiday beach, the place where they met, a place where a parent’s ashes were scattered, or even a football pitch.

But it said that there was a risk that criminal gangs running sham or forced marriages would move in, and that ‘inappropriate’ organisations could win the right to run marriages.

‘There was a risk that any group, including those with a cult following, could potentially qualify if they could show their purpose as the advancement of beliefs and the ethics associated with those beliefs, or could successfully have it determined that they were being discriminated against if excluded from conducting legal ceremonies,’ the paper said.

It added: ‘The groups identified as a risk included political organisations, Jedi Knights, Hell’s Angels, radicalised groups and criminal gangs involved in forced marriage.’ One critic of reform, it said, feared that pressure groups would try to conduct marriages to raise funds for their cause.

The Ministry of Justice paper said that the Government law reform advisers, the Law Commission, will be asked to ‘begin as soon as possible a broader review of the law concerning marriage ceremonies.

‘An independent review should be able to examine all the issues arising from the consultation alongside all other relevant matters. The Government will start to work with the Commission in January to consider the scope of such a review.’
