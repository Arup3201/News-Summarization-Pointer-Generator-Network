A swimwear model has told how a DIY lip job ended in disaster when she tried to emulate the super pout of reality star Kylie Jenner.

The youngest reality star sister has sparked a huge craze for lip fillers, despite insisting that her full lips are natural. 

But unable to afford £200 injectable chemical fillers, part-time swimwear model and retail worker Gail Scott, from Salisbury in Wiltshire, was intrigued when she heard about a DIY version. 

Gail Scott was desperate to emulate Kylie Jenner's famous pout but didn't want to spend any money so sucked on a hairspray lid and was left with painful bruising above and below her lips

Gail had heard about a tool available online, which promises an enhanced look without injections. 

Buyers suck into a lip shaped vessel to increase blood supply to the lips, temporarily giving an artificial plumped look. 

Instead of spending £30 on the product, she used the lid of a mini hairspray bottle instead. After placing it over her lips, she sucked for five minutes until her lips started to tingle.

Initially she was delighted when she removed the lid to see her lips looked fuller. But minutes later she was left with painful  bruising around her mouth that has left her unable to model since and now she wants to issue a warning against the craze currently sweeping social media.

She said: ‘I look like I’ve been punched in the mouth. Apart from the pain, the dark bruising above my mouth looks like a moustache.

'I feel ridiculous and I haven’t wanted to leave the house since. I thought I was saving money but it’s cost me a fortune in make-up trying to cover it up.

'My lips looked great after - but only for about three minutes until the bruising started and then my lips went down anyway. 

'I want other women to know the dangers, it’s not worth it. I was lucky not to burst a blood vessel because since I posted my warning I’ve heard that can happen.’

Gail says she feels ridiculous and hasn't wanted to leave the house since the incident, even having to forego modelling until her bruising heals

Gail had been saving for lip fillers ever since Kylie Jenner’s pout sparked a huge craze for lip enhancements.

Gail explains: ‘I know a lot of girls who have had it done because they like the way her lips look. It’s never been so popular.’

So keen to keep up with her peers, Gail planned to have the procedure, too.

She explains: ‘It wasn’t that I was unhappy with my lips, I’ve never had an issue with them, but I liked the way enhanced lips look, especially around the cupids bow.'

But at £200 a time she was struggling to save the cash. She said: ‘I wanted it done earlier this year but I’ve been saving for a holiday and then my laptop broke so when heard about a cheaper way I decided to try it.’ 

Gail is warning other women who may have heard about DIY lip jobs to steer well clear after her botched attempt that left her in serious pain

However, her thrifty attempt has left her worse off than she was before and she's turned to make-up to try and cover the bruising and says she won’t be able to model again until it’s healed completely. 

'I thought I’d saved money but it’s probably cost me that in foundation trying to cover it,’ she added.

Gail posted a warning on her own Facebook page at the weekend and says she has since been thanked by other women who were planning to perform DIY lip jobs.

She said: ‘I have been lucky. I’ve since heard of other women who have actually burst blood vessels doing this. It’s just not worth it.’
