As one of the most glamorous members of the Royal family, there is always an expectation for Sophie Wessex to pull stylish outfits out of the bag.

And today, as she made a public appearance at a school in Streatham, she managed to pick a winner.

The Countess Of Wessex wore an elegant white Proenza Schouler coat (which retails at £1,740) and black skirt - but brought a contemporary flourish to the outfit with the addition of a very on-trend snakeskin clutch.

The Countess of Wessex paid a visit to Levity School in Streatham this morning - and cut a fine figure in an elegant white £1,740 Proenza Schouler coat accessorised with a trendy snakeskin clutch

The Livity School is a primary school for children with complex needs, 
which was created in September 2001 as part of Lambeth's Special Needs 
Strategy

Sophie arrived at the Livity School 
in Streatham, accompanied by the Lord Lieutenant of Greater London, 
after driving herself to the venue.

At the school, she met pupils and staff and observed them at work as well as addressing officials, parents and guests.

The Livity School is a primary school 
for children with complex needs, which was created in September 2001 as 
part of Lambeth’s Special Needs Strategy.

Some of the children suffer from severe learning disabilities, profound physical impairment, autistic spectrum disorders and medical conditions.

'Livity’ is a new word, coined by the school, which 
essentially means ‘Living Life Positively'. The school aims to help all 
pupils to build self-esteem and confidence thus promoting their maximum 
achievement.
