We know how it ended last time.

And now, a week after sparking controversy by posing up for a selfie at Nelson Mandela's memorial service, David Cameron and Helle Thorning-Schmidt are back together.

The Prime Minister and his Danish counterpart were both pictured arriving in Brussels today for an EU summit.

Controversial: The moment David Cameron, Ms Thorning-Schmidt and Barack Obama pose for a photo at a memorial service for Nelson Mandela

Although they were without Barack Obama, the third participant in the notorious smartphone snap, the two seemed in good spirits as they arrived for the two-day conference on defence policy and economic union.

The world leaders have endured a barrage of criticism since the light-hearted moment at the service commemorating former South African President Nelson Mandela memorial on 10 December.

There have also been calls to release the image, held on Ms Thorning-Schmidt's phone, though at present the image it remains private, and, according to the Danish Prime Minister, 'isn't a particularly good picture'.

Over the weekend it emerged that David Cameron has apparently encouraged her to release the photograph, and auction it to raise money for charity.

A source familiar with the exchange told The Sunday Times: 'Helle wanted to delete it, but Cameron urged her not to. He pointed out that it could raise a lot of money.'

However,
 Downing Street refused to confirm if the conversation took place when 
contacted by MailOnline, or, if it did, what was said.

Ms Thorning-Schmidt did not reveal whether she would delete the image or just refrain from showing it to the public.

Speaking to Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet, she said: 'It isn't a particularly good picture.'

She previously defended the selfie saying that the trio of world leaders were just 'having a bit of fun', and that the relaxed picture was in keeping with the spirit of the event.

The
 Dane, who is married to former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock's son 
Stephen, 42, has enjoyed a glamorous reputation in her native country 
since becoming prime minister in 2011.

The selfie shot happened during the memorial service of South African former president Nelson Mandela at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on December 10

The selfie led to a backlash from Twitter users who said it was inappropriate behaviour at an event to remember the life of the anti-apartheid hero

She said: 'There were lots of pictures taken that day, and I just thought it was a bit of fun.

'Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun.'

In an interview with Danish Daily Berlinske, she
 added: 'There was a sadness, but it was basically a festive event that 
also celebrated a man who has lived for 95 years and achieved so much in
 his life.

'There was dancing on the stands. And then we took a really fun selfie.'

Obama,
 Cameron and Thorning-Schmidt were captured taking the picture at the 
FNB Stadium near Johannesburg on Tuesday, as thousands of mourners 
gathered to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela.

The photograph was taken shortly after
 President Obama gave a rousing speech about the former South African 
President and civil rights campaigner who died aged 95.

The White House has not commented on the photograph, but David Cameron this week brushed off the incident.

The Danish Prime Minister has enjoyed a glamorous reputation in her native country since being elected in 2011

During
 Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons he said: 'In my 
defense, I would say that Nelson Mandela played an extraordinary role in
 his life and in his death in bringing people together.

So of course when a member of the Kinnock family asked me for a photograph, I thought it was only polite to say yes.' 

But the controversy is not going away as quickly as the world leaders would like.

It
 led to a backlash from Twitter users who said it was inappropriate 
behaviour at an event to remember the life of the anti-apartheid hero.

Twitter
 user James Armitage wrote: 'What selfish morons take a "selfie" at a 
memorial service? Oh yeah that's right, Barack Obama and David Cameron.'

In a message directed at Mr Cameron, Sarah McDermott said: 'You have precisely zero class or decorum.'
