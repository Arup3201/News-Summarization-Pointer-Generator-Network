Sometimes you can try and disguise but you can't hide, as this new mugshot shows.

Codi James Antoniello, 19, from Holland Township in Michigan was chased by police last Thursday after allegedly attacking a 21-year-old man with a pickax and baseball bat.

In a bid to escape, he quickly tried to alter his appearance by shaving his head.

However, he was caught mid-transformation and a booking photo shows him with a large bald strip running through his brown locks.

Antoniello was arraigned Friday on charges of felonious assault and first-degree home invasion along with a 16-year-old accomplice.

A spokesperson from the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office told Wood TV the two teenagers broke into a man's home around 2:30am last Wednesday and bludgeoned him.

The victim’s father called 911 after trying to break up the fight.

It's believed the attack stemmed around a woman and Antoniello is dating the victim's ex-girlfriend.

All of the parties involved had reportedly been communicating via Facebook before coming to blows.

The victim sustained injuries to his head and face and was taken to the hospital where he was listed in good condition.

Antoniello and the other alleged attacker fled the scene but detectives caught up with them a day later at an apartment complex.

Police told Fox News that Antoniello was apprehended while he was in the process of shaving his head to change his look.

Antoniello is being held at the Ottawa County jail while the 16-year-old is lodged at a  juvenile detention center.

Both men face the same charges.
