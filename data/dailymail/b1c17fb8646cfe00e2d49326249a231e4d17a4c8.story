Rory McIlroy is well known for his accuracy off the tee, but not even the four-time major winner could claim that he meant his drive on the 14th at East Lake to land where it did.

The Northern Irishman somehow managed to fire his Nike ball into the pocket of an unsuspecting spectator who was enjoying the action in Atlanta, Georgia.

McIlroy's drive flew right off the tee and into a large tree before dropping down directly into the man's beige shorts.

The fan wisely stood still until McIlroy and an official found him to discuss their next move, which ended up being free relief for the 25-year-old.

After chatting briefly with the man and shaking his hand, McIlroy proceeded to fire a beautiful iron shot to within 12 feet of the pin.

The world No 1 then shook the fan's hand once more before striding onto the putting surface and getting down with two strokes to make par.

The incident clearly didn't affect McIlroy, who went on to complete a five-under-par round of 65 to keep himself in the hunt for both the TOUR Championship title and the FedEx Cup.
