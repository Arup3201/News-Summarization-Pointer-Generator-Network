Cristiano Ronaldo disappeared straight down the tunnel of the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday night while the rest of his team-mates went to the centre-circle to applaud supporters.

It followed a strange night for the Real Madrid forward just seven days ahead of the Clasico. He failed to celebrate Gareth Bale’s opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring.

Ronaldo failed to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the area and when the ball was headed off the line Bale volleyed it into the top corner. Incredibly Ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after Bale converted the rebound.

The World Player of the Year endured a difficult game, with his temper bubbling below the surface

It was a tough night for Ronaldo, who will need to improve in time for next week's Clasico

Gary Lineker tweeted: ‘Ronaldo's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to Bale scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy.’

Ronaldo was also frustrated when Bale scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a Ronaldo shot but enough to divert it past the Levante goalkeeper to wrap up the three points.

He also missed a string of chances the day after he was overtaken by Leo Messi in La Liga’s list of top scorers for this season. Ahead of their meeting at the Nou Camp next week the Argentine has 32 goals – two more than Ronaldo.

Ever since Ronaldo collected his third Balon D’or in January and announced to the world that he was ‘coming for’ Messi who has four Golden Ball awards, things have worked in reverse for the planet’s two finest players.

VIDEO Bale was more motivated - Ancelotti 

Messi was 12 goals behind Ronaldo last December but he has not been able to stop scoring since the turn of the year and Real Madrid’s Portuguese striker has dried up.

‘Cristiano was lively because he made the first goal and the second. He didn’t score but he contributed a lot,’ said Carlo Ancelotti after the game.

The Italian coach said he had no reason not to be positive ahead of next week’s Clasico and admitted: ‘Bale was more motivated than usual and the presence of [Luka] Modric helps him. They know each other very well from playing together at Tottenham.'

He will need his talisman Ronaldo back in the right frame of mind before the game however. Last week Ronaldo had to be dragged to the centre-circle by captain Iker Casillas, on Sunday night he ducked out of the post match tradition altogether.

At least next week’s league deciding showdown is away from home.
