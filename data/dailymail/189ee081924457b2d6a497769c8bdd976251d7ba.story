Childhood friend Abo Saddam (pictured) said Omar El-Hussein had gone into prison as a gang member and come out radicalised

The jihadi who murdered two civilians in Denmark swore allegiance to Islamic State just nine minutes before his first attack.

Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein declared his devotion to the terror group on his Facebook page and then gunned down a film director at a free speech debate in Copenhagen.

The 22-year-old fanatic later killed a volunteer security guard at a synagogue before police shot him dead.

Last night it emerged that Danish intelligence service PET was warned that El-Hussein had become radicalised while in prison.

A senior member of his former gang, called the Brothas, said El-Hussein had been released two weeks ago.

Abo Saddam added: ‘When he went inside he was a member of our gang. He lived his life with us. We would drive around, smoke hashish together, fight rival gangs. This is the Omar that I knew.

‘But when he came out he changed. He stopped keeping in touch with the Brothas.

‘Prison changed him. He became a much harder Muslim with more hardcore beliefs. He wanted to act on those beliefs as well, instead of just talking about them.’

The 24-year-old gangster added: ‘He went into prison a gang member like us and came out wanting to wage holy war.’

Last night a video emerged of El-Hussein competing in a Thai kick-boxing bout two years ago looking toned and athletic. 

Highly-skilled, he was known as ‘The Captain’ and hoped to turn professional. Instead, he started smoking marijuana heavily and became involved in tit-for-tat battles with rival gangs in the poor areas of Copenhagen.

In November 2013 he stabbed a man of 19 in the thigh and buttock on a train in an unprovoked attack. 

He was sentenced to two years in prison for grievous bodily harm – where he became radicalised. Born in Denmark to Palestinian parents, he developed a hatred of Jews, his associates claim.

Saddam said: ‘I grew up with him. Academically he was one of the brightest at school.’

It also emerged that El-Hussein posted a video on Facebook called the ‘Sword of Jihad’ 45 minutes before his first attack. 

The footage is of an Arabic song, which says: ‘Soon, soon, will see the indescribable. Our purpose is to destroy you, therefore the sword has been made sharp. We will come to you with slaughter and death.’

And nine minutes before his first attack he wrote: ‘I swear allegiance to Abu Bakr and will obey him in adversity and prosperity, and will not go against the orders I get assigned, unless I witness blatant disbelief.’ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the head of Islamic State.

El-Hussein set up his Facebook page under the Islamic name of Abu Ramadan Almuhajir.

He lists himself as an employee of ‘Murder Inc’. 

El-Hussein, who was well known to police for violence and weapons violations, was killed in a shootout with police in his neighborhood of Norrebro, Copenhagen, following the attacks. Five police officers were injured

Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, who shot 55-year-old film director Finn Nørgaard and 37-year-old security guard Dan Uzan dead after storming a cafe and synagogue on Saturday, may have been radicalised in prison

PET head Jens Madsen has acknowledged that El-Hussein had been ‘on the radar’.

The gunman killed film director Finn Norgaard, 55, while indiscriminately firing at the Krudttønden café on Saturday. 

Some ten hours later he shot Dan Uzan in the head at a synagogue. Mr Uzan, 37, an economist at the Danish treasury, had been acting as a volunteer security guard.

Two police officers, also guarding the synagogue, were wounded.

Two men appeared in court yesterday, accused of providing and disposing of the gun used in the shootings, as well as helping the killer to hide 

Mr Norgaard was killed at a free speech debate attended by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has received death threats for drawings of the Prophet Mohammad, and French ambassador Francois Zimeray, who likened the attacks to the Charlie Hebdo killings. 

Vilks and Zimeray were both unharmed.

Vilks is believed to have been the target of the attack and has previously spoken of how he sleeps with an axe under his bed and has a panic room in his secret location house as he lives under constant threat from Islamist fanatics. 

Yesterday, tens of thousands of Danes gathered at memorials around the country to pay tribute to the victims of the attack.

A torch-lit manifestation in Copenhagen attracted a large crowd, including Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and political leaders from fellow Nordic countries.

Singing John Lennon's Imagine, defiant Danes promised to uphold their trademark open society and showed solidarity with the country's Muslim minority after El-Hussein was identified to have Palestinian roots and a passion for Islamist issues.

The shooting spree was Denmark's worst terror attack since a bomb exploded outside the Copenhagen office of the North West Orient airline in 1985, killing a 27-year-old Algerian tourist.

U.S. president Barack Obama has phoned his Danish counterpart, Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmid, to offer his condolences.

The White House said Mr Obama offered the United States' support, and the pair agreed to work together to confront those who would challenge free speech or religion. 

A torch-lit manifestation in Copenhagen drew tens of thousands of people who lit candles for the victims
