What's in a name? If you're in the South, it's a great deal of honor.

A new study has found that it is far more common for parents to pick names for their newborn sons that stems from their own fathers.

Patronyms, or names that come with 'Junior' or subsequent numbers at the end, are regularly found in cultures where a great amount of honor or where family reputations are held in high regard.

Sons of the South: Patronyms are known to be more common in areas considered 'honor cultures' like the Southern United States. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr was named after his father (pictured together in 1964)

A new study in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin suggests that areas of the country or times of tragedy can influence the selection of names.

The researchers from the University of Oklahoma suggest that the migration of clan families from England, Scotland and Ireland to areas of the south and the Appalachian region resulted in a large congregation of 'honor cultures'.

'Our baby naming practices can shed light on what we care about, in a subtle way, and they might also serve as a mechanism for transmitting our cultural values from one generation to the next,' professor Ryan Brown told The Los Angeles Times.Â 

One such lesson shows that some outdated stereotypes have not gone away over the generations, as the research found that newborn sons are much more likely to be given the names of their forefathers as opposed to newborn daughters.

'That parents in honor states in the 
United States do so with respect to sons but not with respect to 
daughters also communicates cultural values,' the report reads.

'Specifically,
the preference for naming boys after their male forebears underscores 
the special value placed on boys and suggests that male babies are 
considered to be more important than female babies in honor cultures, or
at least in the honor culture found in the United States.'

There was not explicit break down of which states are and are not considered honor states, but that is expected to be the subject of a future study.

Timing was also discovered as a factor, as there was a noted uptick in patronyms following the September 11 terror attacks- except not where they may have been expected.

Even though the attacks killed the most people living near New York and Washington DC, the researchers found that honorific names were given increasingly in states in the South and West that are more generally associated as 'honor cultures'.

Names were not the only way that residents of those states showed their emotional reaction to the attacks, as they also ranked among the areas with the highest military recruitment.

Some of the traits that are associated with honor ideology can be interpreted in negative ways, however, as previous research connected honor ideologies with high suicide and execution rates.
