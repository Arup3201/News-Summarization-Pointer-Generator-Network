A British grandmother on Death Row has called on the British Government to save her in a final emotional plea for clemency.

Linda Carty, 53, who has spent 11 years on Death Row in the United States, is days away from becoming the first British woman to be executed in 50 years after losing her final appeal.

Ms Carty was convicted of killing a young mother in Texas ten years ago and plotting to steal her four-day-old baby with three men, but has always insisted she was framed.

British woman Linda Carty could receive a date for her lethal injection at any time after her conviction for killing a mother and planning to steal her baby

In an emotional final plea, she said:
'I wouldn't ask the British Government to lobby for me if I knew that I
was guilty, because it would be an embarrassment to myself and my 
family, but also to the country that I love.

'When I say that I am innocent and that I didn’t commit this crime, I mean that.'

The prosecution claimed she masterminded the fatal kidnapping of her 25-year-old neighbour, Joana Rodriguez, who was found dead with duct tape over her mouth and a plastic bag around her head in a car Ms Carty was leasing.

The baby was found unharmed in the car, but the mother-of-one could receive a date for her execution by lethal injection at any time.

Former primary school teacher Ms Carty was born on the Caribbean island of St Kitts before its independence from Britain.

Ms Carty's latest appeal comes after she contested her conviction two years ago in a video plea alongside a document from the British Government outlining its concerns over the trial.

Tearful: Ms Carty's daughter, Jovelle Carty Joubert, has been rallying MPs for support

The request for a retrial was based on claims she was given inadequate legal support during her original trial and the Government were blocked in their efforts to help her.

Her daughter, Jovelle Carty Joubert, has been rallying MPs for support for two years following the US Supreme Court's refusal to re-open her case.

The Foreign Office said it was lobbying the Texas authorities to stop her execution. A statement said: 'The Prime Minister and British Government are deeply concerned.'

Ms Carty has always insisted she was framed by three men in revenge for her work as an informant working for a drug enforcement agency.

The last British woman to be executed was Ruth Ellis in 1955. She was hanged for shooting her lover outside a pub in North London.
