One of Scotland’s top swimmers could be axed from the Commonwealth Games team after he was arrested in the US for urinating on a police car.

Edinburgh-born Dan Wallace spoke of his regret over the moment of madness as he waited to hear whether it would rule him out of Glasgow 2014.

If it does result in his being thrown off Team Scotland, it would be a personal disaster for the 21-year-old and his parents Derek and Tanya, who sold the family home to pay for his fees at the University of Florida.

Mistake: Dan Wallace could be kicked out of Team Scotland after being arrested for urinating on a police car

Mr Wallace has already been suspended indefinitely from his swimming team at the University of Florida where he is trained by US Olympic team coach Gregg Troy – but the consequences of his arrest could be much more far reaching.

Mr Wallace, 21, said: ‘On the early morning of May 4, I made a poor decision in judgment. I understand that my accomplishments in swimming have the potential to be overshadowed by my behaviour outside of the pool.’

He added: ‘My actions have embarrassed my family, school, team, coaches, team-mates and myself. I am truly sorry to everyone affected by my mistake. I will use this negative experience to help me grow as a person and as a swimmer.’

According to the Gainesville Police Department report into the incident, Mr Wallace was spotted urinating on a police car in a street in the town.

The report says that when a uniformed officer approached Mr Wallace he started running.

The arresting officer continued: ‘I told the DEF [defendant] to stop, but the DEF refused to stop. The DEF was taken to the ground and continued to thrash his body on the ground refusing to be handcuffed.

‘The DEF was eventually placed in handcuffs.’

Punishment: Wallace has already been banned indefinitely from the University of Florida swim team

The officer added that, after he was read his rights, Mr Wallace stated that he ran because he was scared and that he had made a mistake.

Mr Wallace, who is studying anthropology at the University of Florida, is due to represent his country in the 400m freestyle, the 200m and 400m individual medleys and the 4x200m freestyle at the Games later this year.

He told the Mail on Friday that he had had contact with Team Scotland following the incident but he did not know yet whether it would affect his selection for Glasgow 2014.

He said: ‘I’m sure over the next few days I’ll find out. Hopefully it won’t affect my swimming career on a long-term basis. I’m just trying to get through this day by day.’

After learning of his student’s arrest, coach Mr Troy, a renowned disciplinarian in the swimming community, said; ‘We are disappointed in some of the choices Dan Wallace made.

‘Because of his actions he will be suspended from team activities indefinitely. Any decisions regarding a change to his status will be addressed internally.’

Remorse: Wallace has expressed his regret over the incident while hoping he can pay back his parents' sacrifice

A spokesman from Team Scotland said no decision would be taken until all the information had been received and considered.

Mr Wallace, who is in his second year training at the university, has previously paid tribute to the efforts his parents have made to allow him to pursue his sporting dreams in the US where he can be coached by the best in the business.

He said: ‘My parents have sacrificed a lot. They work really hard to keep me in Florida and I work really hard to make them proud so it works out well.’

He added: ‘When I’m feeling tired, I just think how much they’ve put in and it’ s only fair I do the same.’
