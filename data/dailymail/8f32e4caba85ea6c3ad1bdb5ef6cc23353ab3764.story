The BBC has spent more than £220,000 on iPhone lessons for staff.

Figures have revealed the corporation spent licence fee payers' money teaching 783 employees how to properly use the gadget over a period of three years.

This works out at a cost of nearly £300 per person.

 Earlier this year it was revealed that the BBC spent around £2.5million buying more than 4,000 iPhones, 400 iPads and 800 MacBooks for staff in the previous two years

But the BBC have pointed out that the figure for last year's training bill  - £42,000 - was the lowest so far, according to the figures released under a Freedom of Information request. 

Earlier this year it was revealed that the BBC spent around £2.5million buying more than 4,000 iPhones, 400 iPads and 800 MacBooks for staff in the previous two years.

Andy Silvester, campaign manager for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: It's absolutely incredible that the BBC has run up a bill of this size teaching staff to use mainstream technology.

'School teachers across the country know full well that teenagers can master an iPhone, so professionals should be able to.

'The BBC must cut out this kind of wasteful spending, or sympathy for the £145-a-year TV tax will continue to wane.' 

Presenters are regularly seen showing off their expensive Apple products on television - but the figures revealed thousands of off-screen staff are also getting hold of the gadgets.

The Corporation have been buying iPhones at a rate of 200 a month for the last two years - shunning dozens of cheaper mobiles.

In total, they bought 4,266 iPhones, 427 iPads and 815 MacBooks between January 2012 and October 2013, according to figures released to MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act.

The number of iPads bought was relatively low because the BBC only started buying them for staff in December 2012 - and have been purchasing them at a rate of more than 40 a month since then, according to the latest full figures.

The estimated cost of purchasing the Apple products is around £2.5million - based on standard retail prices although the BBC get a discount.

However, the true cost of issuing staff with the gadgets will soar once the cost of mobile phone contracts with the Corporation's network operator O2 are taken into account.

A spokesman for the BBC said that iPhones are only issued to staff who need them to do their jobs and they are not simply given out to all workers.

They added: 'We are harnessing new technologies to train our journalists to use their phones to film, edit and transmit news stories on mobile phones.

'This not only keeps costs down for the licence fee payer but also increases our ability to work in remote places where there are no other means of broadcasting.'
