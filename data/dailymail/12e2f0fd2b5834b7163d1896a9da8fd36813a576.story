Even at the best of times, it is hard to tell from Simon Fuller’s strangely taut, perma-tanned face exactly what he is thinking.

It is a mask of inscrutability that, no doubt, comes in handy during the negotiations the management Svengali conducts on a daily basis for his roster of sporting and showbusiness stars.

But there was no hiding his unadulterated glee as Fuller watched from the players’ box as his client Andy Murray became the first British man since 1936 to reign supreme at Wimbledon.

Indeed, look closely and it was almost possible to see the pound signs in Fuller’s eyes. Because for Murray — and his delighted manager — the tills are set to start ringing like never before. 

Already big-money offers are coming in. And they could boost the tennis player’s fortune from its current £32 million to upwards of £200 million, say experts.

‘It is on a par with winning the World Cup — it’s very exciting,’ Fuller says of the 26-year-old Scot’s historic win. ‘Andy will hopefully achieve all the things that come with success.’

By that, of course, he is talking about oodles of cash — a sizeable chunk of which will boost Fuller’s £375 million fortune for providing his expert advice.

Such vast wealth has been achieved through the savvy marketing of his  A-list clients, who include David Beckham, Jennifer Lopez and Lewis Hamilton. And Fuller rarely misses an opportunity to promote those he represents. Just look at the Royal Box during the men’s final.

There, stealing attention in a skimpy black negligee dress from her own collection, was Victoria Beckham — another signed to Fuller’s company, XIX Entertainment.

There was no hiding his unadulterated glee as Fuller watched from the players¿ box as his client Andy Murray became the first British man since 1936 to reign supreme at Wimbledon.

Murray broke down in tears after he won the final at last, but he is set to make millions following the event

It seems her appearance — and all the free publicity it brought her clothing line — had as much to do with puppet-master Fuller’s string-pulling as it did with Posh’s love of tennis. Indeed, she spent much of the match on her mobile phone.

Likewise, Murray’s girlfriend Kim Sears, whose roller-coaster of emotions during the match was beamed to millions of television viewers around the world, just happened to be wearing a green lace dress designed — you’ve guessed it — by Victoria Beckham.

Last year, 25-year-old Miss Sears sported a succession of dresses by French designer Roland Mouret — who is also a client of Fuller.

None of which is surprising, perhaps, given that Miss Sears, like Murray’s mother, Judy, and brother, doubles tennis player Jamie, is advised by Fuller as well.

Such corporate symbiosis might seem from the outside to be more than a little cynical, but it is undoubtedly good for business. Yesterday, Fuller arrived in a Bentley to attend a reception at 10 Downing Street, hosted by David Cameron, to celebrate Murray’s win — a victory that is the culmination of five years’ hard work from Fuller and his team as they have assiduously gone about trying to mend the Scotsman’s dour image to make him more appealing to sponsors.

It has not always been an easy sell. Indeed, last autumn when Murray’s contract with XIX was up for renewal, there was speculation in the sports management industry that he was planning to dump Fuller because his on-court success — winning Olympic gold and the U.S. Open last summer — had not translated into significantly increased earnings away from the sport.

All that is about to change. Fuller, who persuaded Murray to stay on his roster, is already fielding calls from eager brands who want to have their names associated with the Wimbledon champion.

Among them is Adidas, who have already opened talks about renewing Andy’s five-year, £15 million deal, which expires at the end of 2014. His new contract, which is likely to more than double in value, is set to make him a global brand ambassador. 

His deal with the sportswear giant is joined by a three-year deal with Swiss watchmaker Rado — signed last June — and worth £9.9 million. He also gets £2 million a year from RBS as well as contracts with racquet maker Head and Jaguar cars. All of which brings Murray in around £10 million a year.

In recent months, Fuller has held off signing up Murray to any new sponsorship deals, gambling on the fact that a win at Wimbledon would massively inflate his future bankability. 

That is set to sky rocket thanks, in part, to a deal Fuller negotiated this year to form a partnership with Indian doubles player and entrepreneur Mahesh Bhupathi. A new company, XIX Globosport, will focus on developing Murray’s commercial interests in the highly lucrative Asia and the Middle East markets.

Fuller planned on softening the Scotsman's personality by allowing the documentary Andy Murray: The Man Behind The Racquet

In the programme, the normally reserved Murray broke down in tears as he discussed the killing of 16 children by Thomas Hamilton in his native  Dunblane in March 1996.

It is just part of the strategy to turn Murray into a global money-making machine. Pivotal to the campaign have been the concerted attempts by Fuller and his team to soften his client’s outwardly less than sparkling personality.

Hence the decision to allow BBC fly-on-the-wall cameras to follow the player for the recent documentary, Andy Murray, The Man Behind The Racquet.

In the programme, the normally reserved Murray broke down in tears as he discussed the killing of 16 children by Thomas Hamilton in his native  Dunblane in March 1996. 

Murray, who was eight at the time and a pupil at the local primary school which was the scene of the massacre, escaped the gunman by hiding in the headmaster’s office. 

Such manipulation of the media has long been 53-year-old Fuller’s stock in trade. He managed the Spice Girls, created teen band S Club 7, and launched Pop Idol in 2001, which went on to be sold to 46 countries around the world.

But he fell out with his former business partner Simon Cowell, who acted as a judge on the British and U.S. versions of the shows, after Cowell launched his own rival show, The X Factor, in 2004.

The feud has hardly dented Fuller’s bank balance. In 2005, he sold 19 Entertainment for £130 million and later launched XIX Entertainment. 

Unlike the stars he promotes, Fuller likes to keep his private life below the radar. In 2008, he married blonde interior designer Natalie Swanston, who is 18 years his junior, and the couple now have a two-year-old daughter.

His reticence, does not however, extend to his assessment of his own talent. 

‘My business is creating fame and celebrity, and I’m one of the best in the world,’ Fuller says.  ‘I understand popular entertainment better than anyone. I want to have the world’s No.1 tennis player, the hottest movie, the biggest artist.’

One thing that seems certain is that thanks to his Wimbledon success, Andy Murray and the man pulling his strings are about to get even richer.
