A 19-year-old New York City man has died after partially-decapitating himself with his own remote-controlled helicopter.

Roman Pirozek Jr, was pulling a stunt with the chopper at a Brooklyn park Thursday afternoon when he lost control and the RC device flew into his head. The blades sliced off a piece of his skull and slashed his throat.

Pirozek was an avid model helicopter enthusiast, who was vice-president of a local hobby club. He posted several videos of himself flying helicopters on YouTube.

One clip shows him putting his Trex 700 helicopter through incredible tricks. The video culminates with him dropping the $1,500 model from the sky, only to restart the rotor when it is just inches from his head.

The high-end RC helicopter has a blade span of 62 inches, with a rotor that spins at more than 2,000rpm. It weighs a little over six pounds.

Pirozek's own father watched in horror as his son's helicopter slashed off a chunk of his head, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The teenager was dead when police arrived at the field. Pictures from the scene show the remote control near his covered body.

'He was known to be aggressive in his flying and often executed tricks. He was executing a trick when he was struck,' a police source told the Journal.

Pirozek and at least three other members of his model helicopter club, Seaview Rotary Wings, were at Calvert Vaux Park in Brooklyn, New York, near Coney Island.

The park is a designated spot for model aircraft enthusiasts to fly their creations.

Priozek was vice-president of Seaview Rotatary Rings and recently participated in a demonstration in Delaware. 

An aerial photo taken from a WNBC news chopper showed a Brooklyn detective examining the small toy, which landed on its rotor in the grass. His body was just 20 feet away.

Police say the aircraft fell from the sky and slashed him in the head and the throat on the way down. 

Pirozek's family said his father, Roman Pirozek Sr., introduced his son to the hobby.
