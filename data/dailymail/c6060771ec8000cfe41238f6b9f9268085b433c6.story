Backer: Arpad Busson, 50, who is pictured with his partner, actress Uma Thurman, donated £20,000

A financier and chart-topping music producer were yesterday named as secret donors to the campaign Hacked Off.

A hedge fund manager who is worth £145million was one of those unveiled.

Arpad Busson, 50, who is the partner of actress Uma Thurman and had two children with model Elle Macpherson, donated £20,000 to the pressure group lobbying for new press laws.

Producer Guy Chambers, 50, who worked with singer Robbie Williams, and science writer Simon Singh, 48, were also revealed by The Observer as contributing to the celebrity-led organisation.

It comes after it was revealed last week that heiress Jemima Khan helped bankroll Hacked Off with a £5,000 donation. The writer and socialite is one of the wealthy backers of the group fronted by her ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant - and a separate four-figure sum reportedly came from her mother, Lady Annabel Goldsmith.

The group has come under increasing pressure to disclosure its income sources.

Two months ago it refused to tell MPs which rich individuals are financing it - and academic Brian Cathcart, a co-founder, was heckled at a literary festival when he declined to unmask donors.

Professor Cathcart told the Commons committee in March that Mr Grant had donated 'quite substantial' damages he received from News International over phone-hacking.

But he would not name other individuals, leading one MP to tweet: 'The champions of openness that is Hacked Off refuse to name large private donors in non-answers to my questions.'

Mr Chambers and Mr Singh each donated £1,000. Mr Busson, a French-born financier who is thought to have been a supporter of the group for some time, could not be contacted for comment.

But Mr Singh said he was backing Hacked Off because he wanted to support free speech, and told The Observer: ‘It is about getting the balance right between free speech and a responsible press.’

Mr Chambers has not commented. A Hacked Off spokesman said: ‘We do not regret accepting money to fund our activities from some people who do not want their donations made public.'
