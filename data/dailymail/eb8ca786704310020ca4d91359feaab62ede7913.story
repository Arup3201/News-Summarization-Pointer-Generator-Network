A 21-year-old suspected drunk driver killed her sister, a friend and an entire family of four after speeding 100 miles per hour in the wrong direction on a California freeway early Sunday morning.

Olivia Culbreath was the only survivor when her red Chevrolet Camaro crashed into a Ford Explorer near Diamond Bar.

All four in the explorer died at the scene. The coroner identified the victims of that car as Gregorio Mejia-Martines (47), his wife Leticia Ibarra (42), their daughter Jessica Jasmine Mejia (20), and relative Ester Delgado (age unknown).Â

Hunting for clues: Officials investigate the scene of the horrific accident

Alcohol is suspected to be the primary factor in the accident after Culbreath was observed by law enforcement as acting drunk both at the scene and in the hospital.

However, her blood alcohol content has not been made public.

She suffered a broken femur and a ruptured bladder but is listed in stable condition, sources told NBC Los Angeles.

Culbreath has been arrested and charged with counts of vehicular manslaughter and felony DUI, Urrea told MailOnline.

She is in custody but remains at the hospital while recovering from injuries sustained in the crash.

Adding more tragedy to the deadly crash, KTLA learned that Culbreath had just given birth to a child last June.

Recovering: Culbreath is still healing from her injuries in the hospital. When she gets better, police will officially take her into custody. She faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and DUI

Shut down: The entire westbound side of the highway is shutdown while investigators comb the scene for evidence
