Charged: Christopher Phillips is the man Canadian police arrested this morning in connection to a chemical threat in Nova Scotia

The ex-husband of decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller appeared in court Friday over an investigation into hazardous chemicals in Nova Scotia.

Police allege Christopher Burton Phillips, 42, possessed a chemical called osmium tetroxide for a dangerous purpose.

The discovery of hazardous chemicals prompted the evacuation of two neighborhoods in Halifax this week and an Ottawa hotel where Phillips was arrested. 

Royal Canadian Mounted Police refused to identify the suspect who was apprehended at a hotel in Ottowa on Wednesday.

However Miller's business manager confirmed the wanted man was her ex-husband Christopher Phillips, an American former biochemical weapons expert.

Phillips had been charged with uttering threats against police and possessing a dangerous chemical, and was remanded into custody Friday.

He will next appear in court on January 29. 

The hunt for Phillips began Tuesday after police found large quantities of dangerous chemicals at two Nova Scotia homes connected to his family.

His current wife warned police that he was on his way to Ottowa, about a 14 hour drive west, in a van that could possibly be packed with even more hazardous materials.

A Canada-wide alert issued Tuesday night stated that the suspect was an ex-military weapons specialist with possible mental health issues.

After Phillips' van was spotted in the parking lot of an Ottowa hotel Tuesday night, the building was evacuated and he was arrested without incident the following morning. A subsequent search found no chemicals at the hotel or in his van.

Court documents allege the offenses took place between Dec. 26 and Jan. 21 in a Halifax suburb. Police did not elaborate on the charges.

Phillips, a former ophthalmologist, married U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller in June 1999, three years after she won two gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta, Georgia Olympics.

However, they separated in 2004 and officially divorced in 2006 and Phillips later moved to Canada.

'I'm thankful that the brave men and women of the Ottawa police department and other law enforcement agencies were able to apprehend him and (defuse) the situation without incident,' Miller said in a statement released by her manager, Nick Furris.

Miller now works as a motivational speaker.

Police in Nova Scotia were first alerted to a possible threat Monday night around 9:20pm when they received a call about a suspicious package at a local home.

They went on to investigate three homes connected to Phillips in two neighborhoods which were evacuated over the dangerous materials thought to be inside.

Of the three buildings searched Tuesday, 'hazardous and volatile' materials were found in two - one home on Lakeridge Crescent owned by Phillips' current wife Gosia Phillips and a cottage on Dyke Road registered to a Marian Sue Phillips of El Reno, Oklahoma. It's unclear the relationship between Marian and the suspect. 

'The chemicals are of a nature that we need to employ a chemist to help us identify what type of chemicals that they are,' RCMP Corporal Greg Churcd said of the materials found in the cottage.

Police would not elaborate on how many chemicals were found, or what type. However, residents in  the Grand Desert neighborhood of the Dyke Road cottage remained evacuated Wednesday evening.

Do not disturb: Those staying at the Chimo Hotel (pictured above) were told to quietly leave their rooms Tuesday night after it was suspected Phillips might have brought chemicals into the building. No hazardous materials were found, but police were able to apprehend Phillips staying in one of the rooms

Gosia Phillips allegedly told police that her husband was en route to Ottowa in a Chevy cube van, that was feared to be packed with even more dangerous chemicals.

Police issued a Canada-wide alert for the van Tuesday night, saying the suspect driver was an ex-military weapons specialist with possible mental health issues and an 'anti-police' attitude.

'Person reported to have mental health issues/PTSD and has issues with law enforcement personnel. Person may have chemicals or hazardous materials in the vehicle,' the report read.

It was later revealed that police believed Phillips was carrying the chemicals osmium and osmium tetroxide in his van. The lab chemicals are highly dangerous and can easily penetrate the skin. About a decade ago, the chemicals were feared as a possible terrorist weapon.

Around 10pm, an Ottowa police officer spotted a van matching the description in the parking lot of the Chimo Hotel.

All of the guests were called and told to quietly evacuate so police could search the building for chemicals and the suspect. 

Authorities also closed down several roads surrounding the hotel as a precaution.

Phillips was apprehended the following morning - his 42nd birthday - without incident from a room on the sixth floor of the hotel.

Police finished searching the building and Phillips' van later that afternoon without finding any chemicals.

Phillips LinkedIn page shows a diverse academic background with advanced degrees in medicine, law and business.

Re-married: Phillips pictured above in a picture posted to Facebook. He is reportedly married to Harvard University-educated a sleep doctor named Gosia Phillips

He studied medicine at the University of Oklahoma and Boston University before pursuing opthamology at the University of Texas. He also has a law degree and MBA from Suffolk University.

It has been reported that Phillips was a former biomedical weapons expert for the U.S. Army. However, the U.S. military says they have no record of Phillips, though the records only date back to 1999.

His LinkedIn page lists his current job as the manager of Neurology and Sleep Medicine Associates Inc, which was searched Tuesday and found to contain no hazardous materials.

His wife Gosia Phillips is equally accomplished. She attended Harvard University and is a specialist in sleep medicine, in addition to teaching medicine at Dalhousie University.

Records show that Gosia Phillips changed her name from Malgorzata Ewa Klonowska in February 2010.

Before he moved to Canada and married Gosia, Phillips' career appears to have been plagued by complaints of botched surgeries.

The Washington State Health Department investigated Phillips over several complaints from former patients at his laser eye care clinic and he eventually agreed not to renew his expired license to practice.

And in 2008, Phillips reportedly stopped going to work because of psychiatric issues.

According to a documents obtained by the Ottowa Citizen, Phillips was hospitalized between March 3 and March 7, 2008 and March 22 and April 18, 2008 for an unknown psychiatric diagnosis.

'The records from this hospitalization contain diagnoses which would make it very difficult or impossible for (Phillips) to obtain employment as an expert witness,' the documents state.

Nova Scotia court records also show that Phillips was charged for uttering threats and possession of a weapon between December 26 and Wednesday.
