This is the moment Manti Te'o met his 'girlfriend.' Video captured the Notre Dame football star embracing Ronaiah Tuiasosopo last November.

When Te'o hugged Ronaiah, he reportedly thought he was meeting the 'favorite cousin' of his online girlfriend Lennay Kekua.

Ronaiah was later revealed as the man who allegedly posed as Lennay on Facebook and Twitter and lured Te'o into a long-distance relationship.

It was claimed on Thursday that Ronaiah developed 'intense feelings' for Te'o during the fake encounter. Te'o says he never knew his girlfriend was actually a man - even though they talked on the phone.

TMZ reports that as a result of the the long-distance relationship that Ronaiah developed with Te'o while he was pretending to be Lennay, he channeled most of his emotions through the online female alter-ego. 

The video was shot on November 24 as Te'o was leaving the Los Angeles Coliseum after his team's victory against the University of Southern California.

Te'o admitted to Katie Couric during his first televised interview today that he only learned the Lennay Kekua was not real on December 6. He admitted he lied about his girlfriend, who he was told died of cancer following a car crash, in two December interviews.

The revelation earlier this month that Te'o's relationship with Lennay was a hoax rocked the college football world.

The pictures that Ronaiah allegedly used for Kekua's online persona are actually photos of Diane O'Meara, a 23-year-old marketing manager in Los Angeles.

She says she had no connection with Te'o or Ronaiah.

Te'o's story of perseverance in the face of tragedy came the stuff of legend for the University of Notre Dame - whose football program is built on seemingly mythical characters.

During his interview with Couric on Thursday, the talk show house brought up the possibility that Te'o may have been involved in a sexual affair and made up girlfriend 'Lennay Kekua' as a cover.

She then asked the football star point blank: 'Are you gay?'

Cracking a smile, Te'o responded: 'No. Far from it. Far from it.'

Te'o also vehemently denied any involvement in the hoax, saying that he believed Kekua was dead until he received a mysterious phone call on December 6 saying that she had not died of leukemia as he had believed.

Pressed by Couric to admit that he was in on the deception, Te'o said he believed Kekua had died from the cancer.

'You stuck to the script. And you knew that something was amiss, Manti,' the talk show host said.

He replied: 'Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on September 12.'

The Heisman Trophy runner-up said he only learned of the hoax when he received a phone call in early December from a woman saying she was Kekua.

Te'o told Couric: 'From December 6 to January 16, my whole reality is that she was dead and she was suddenly alive.'

It wasn't until Deadspin.com reported the hoax that he finally learned the truth.

He said he had 'known' Kekua though Twitter and Facebook and he was drawn to her by the fact that she was Polynesian, loved her faith and 'knew a lot' about his Mormon beliefs.

The interview took an emotional turn as he was joined by his parents Brian and Ottilia.

Speaking of the day they learned of the ruse - Christmas - his mother told Couric: 'It took (Manti) a while to say it. He said "Lennay's alive. It came as a complete and utter shock."'

She added: 'The deception wasn’t only with Manti. It was our family.'
