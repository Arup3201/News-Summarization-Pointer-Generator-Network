A new artwork by elusive street artist Banksy based on a famous painting from 1665 has been spotted on a wall in his home town.

The piece - which is a parody of Girl with a Pearl Earring by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer - incorporates a burglar alarm as the earring.

Banksy entitled the work Girl with a Pierced Eardrum, and painted it on a building near Bristol's docks before posting it on his website.

The artist made a joke about a burger van opposite the painting, with the caption ‘Gallery café open Monday to Sunday 8am to 2pm’.

The original painting inspired a historical novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier in 1999, and a 2003 film starring Scarlett Johansson.

The last Banksy work seen in Bristol was Mobile Lovers - stencilled outside a youth club, and sold to a collector for £403,000 in August.

And the most recent Banksy art anywhere was Art Buff, seen in Folkestone, Kent, on September 28. It has since been vandalised twice.
