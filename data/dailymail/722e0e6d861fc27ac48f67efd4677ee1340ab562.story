Federal officials say a fishing boat that washed ashore in Northern California is the first debris to reach the state that's been confirmed as having come from the Japanese tsunami.

The 20-foot vessel belongs to the marine sciences program at Takata High School in the town of Rikuzentakata in the Iwate prefecture, the Del Norte Triplicate reports.

The boat washed ashore in Crescent City on April 7.

The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration confirmed the boat's origin on Thursday with help from the Japanese Consulate in San Francisco, according to the Triplicate.

NOAA spokeswoman Keeley Belva says the skiff is the first confirmed debris from the 2011 tsunami in California.

In total, 27 items from among more than 1,600 reports of debris have been firmly traced back to the tsunami.

Japan has asked for the boat back.

Officials from the Japanese city of 
Rikuzentakata said it is in a 'giddy state of shock' and would love to 
get the boat back now it has been found in northern California.

The 20ft boat was been discovered in the town of Crescent City, midway between the cities of San Francisco and Portland.

The boat had traveled a distance of some 5,500 miles.

The Japanese found out where the boat was after officials in the U.S. posted a picture on Crescent City’s Facebook page.

Just hours later, a teacher from a school in Japan, said the boat was theirs.

Humboldt State University geologist Lori Dengler says she posted the photos recently after a university librarian translated the name of the high school from the boat.

The earthquake and tsunami which struck Japan in 2011 was the most powerful in the country’s history, and killed more than 16,000 people.

When the deadly tsunami struck Japan 
in March 2011, about five million tons of debris was dragged into the 
Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese government estimates.

In March 2011, the tsunami flooded over the breakwater protecting the coastal city of Miyako at Heigawa estuary

Most of the flotsam and jetsam later sunk to the bottom, but about 1.5 tons of debris continued floating across the ocean.

Some
of tsunami remnants found their way to American shores, including two 
docks that made landfall in Washington and Oregon. But the only living 
organisms that were discovered on the docks included plant life and 
invertebrate like limpets and barnacles.

Last June, a 70ft dock landed on a
beach north of Newport. It was determined to be one of four docks that 
broke loose from the Port of Misawa on Honshu, Japan, the station KOIN reported.

In December 2012, a second Japanese dock drifted ashore on the Olympic Peninsula in northwestern Washington.

Prior
to the discovery of the fish on the skiff, scientists believed that no 
species could survive a long journey across the ocean, and that only 
large objects, like docks, could support life.
