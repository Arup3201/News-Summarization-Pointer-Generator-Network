Labour's rising star Chuka Umunna has declared that he has no problem with people making 'a lot of money'.

The shadow business secretary, tipped as a future party leader, even said Labour wanted to help people become millionaires.

Mr Umunna's remarks echo former Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson - who famously said that Labour under Tony Blair was 'intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich'.

Chuka Umunna, tipped as a future Prime Minister, is known to speak regularly with Blairite heavyweight Lord Mandelson

Mr Blair himself said he did not go into politics 'to make sure that David Beckham earns less money'.

Mr Umunna's remarks appear in stark contrast to those of Labour leader Ed Miliband - who has vowed to create a more equal society.

But the Labour frontbencher told The House magazine: 'I don’t have a problem with people making a lot of money, so long as they pay their taxes and it’s good for our economy.'

He added: 'I’m very clear: we want to help people make their first million.  

Peter Mandelson, the former Business Secretary, is now a Labour peer. He was a key member of the New Labour government

'If you set up a start-up and you increase you turnover to over a million, you will be employing people and delivering tax receipts to the Exchequer and helping Britain pay its way in the world. We should be saying that.'

Mr Umunna also praised new Treasury minister Sajid Javid's successful career in banking.

He said: 'I don’t have a problem with the fact that Sajid earned millions of pounds working in the City before he was elected.

'I have more of a problem with what he stands for and what he believes in and that’s what the focus should be.'

The intervention comes after Mr Miliband earlier this year said 'tackling inequality is the new centre ground of politics'.

After winning the Labour leadership in 2010 he said equality was 'at the very heart of why we need to move on from New Labour'.

He said: 'During our years in power, we didn't do enough to stop the gap between rich and poor getting wider.'

But Mr Umunna launched an impassioned defence of Mr Blair's record.

The Labour MP said: 'We achieved a huge amount in office, and we should shout more loudly about it.

'We all know what the Conservative strategy will be, and that will be to argue that Labour crashed the car.

'Well, that is not the experience of my constituents when they look at the six new and improved health centres in Streatham, when they look at our safer neighbourhood teams in every ward, when they look at improved school buildings, reduced class sizes and the increased numbers of young people going to university for the first time in their family’s history.

'Don’t tell me we crashed the car, because we left this country in an immeasurably better state in 2010 than we found it in 1997 and Tony Blair has a huge amount to do with that. And people forget that.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband and his shadow business secretary are close allies

Like Mr Blair, the shadow business secretary is religious.

Mr Umunna said: 'My faith has definitely shaped my politics.

'I do try to go to Southwark [Cathedral] at least once a month, and get a bit of time away to reflect.  I wouldn’t say I’m majorly religious. But I am a believer, absolutely.'

Mr Umunna also revealed his inspiration for joining the Labour party - former Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont.

The Labour MP, who attended the private St Dunstan’s College school in south London, challenged Mr Lamont when he came to give a speech.

He said: 'He got up and made the case for the Tories and said why we should support them.

'And I sat in my chair getting more and more agitated by what he was saying, so got up to ask a question, slightly forgetting that this man used to run the UK economy and here I am this 17 year-old challenging him.

'I said "How on earth can you expect us to vote for you when you said you were going to cut taxes and you’ve actually put them up? And you’re jailing female prisoners who are in labour.’

“And of course the reaction in the hall was electric. People were laughing and clapping.

'And I finished asking the question, and was slightly shaking, going "I can’t quite believe I’ve just done that".

'And I always remember Norman said "Are you quite finished yet?" - and I carried on.

'I sat down thinking "I can’t believe I’ve done this".

'And that was the first time I thought maybe I could do politics at some point in the future.'
