Apple could be facing fines of more than £1billion today over ‘sweetheart deals’ allegedly made to minimise its tax bills.

The European Commission is set to criticise Apple’s tax arrangements following a probe into whether the firm made illegal arrangements with the Irish government.

Apple and Starbucks are among a number of US giants accused of avoiding tax through elaborate networks of subsidiaries. Other big names in the spotlight include Google and Amazon.

Computer and phone giants Apple could be facing fines of more than £1billion today over ‘sweetheart deals’ allegedly made to minimise its tax bills

Apple paid just £11.4million in British corporation tax last year – despite sales of a record £10.5billion, it was revealed in July. 

European regulators opened a formal investigation into the tax practices used by Apple – as well as Google and Starbucks – in June.

The Commission said it was concerned authorities in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg may have given the firms preferential treatment, in breach of EU rules.

The results of a preliminary stage of the probe are expected today. If the Commission finds Apple benefited from ‘sweetheart deals’ to cut tax bills in Ireland, it could face huge bills covering the past 10 years.

Last year, a probe by the US senate found that Apple had sheltered £18billion in profits from tax by using ‘ghost companies’ registered in Ireland. This allowed Apple to pay no corporation tax on international profits, including those in the UK.

Before this year Starbucks paid corporation tax in the UK once in 15 years of trading, despite racking up more than £3billion of sales. 

The Commission is also investigating the tax arrangements of Fiat’s financial arm, which is registered in Luxembourg. 

The Commission said it would examine whether generous tax deals granted to Apple in Ireland, Fiat Finance and Trade in Luxembourg, and Starbucks in the Netherlands, amounted to illegal aid.

Apple has denied receiving selective treatment and Starbucks said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules.’

Ebay paid just £620,000 in corporation tax on sales of more than £1billion last year, its latest accounts show. 

The online auction site shaved tens of millions of pounds off its British tax bill by legally channelling payments through Luxembourg and Switzerland.
