Tributes have been laid by grieving friends and family for fireman Stephen Hunt who was killed while tackling a massive blaze at a hair products warehouse.

Messages of love and support have been placed close to the cordoned off scene of the inferno, in Manchester, which took Mr Hunt's life on Saturday evening.

Two teenage girls have been arrested over the death of Mr Hunt, after it is believed to have been started by youngsters smoking cigarettes and discarding them.

The former soldier, 38, was among 60 firefighters sent to tackle the inferno at Paul’s Hair World, in central Manchester.

He is thought to have been enveloped in a cloud of ‘super-heat’ caused by steam or chemicals.

Firefighter Stephen Hunt died on Saturday night in the massive blaze

He and another fireman were pulled from the building and taken to hospital.

Mr Hunt, the father of two teenagers, was pronounced dead, while his colleague remains in hospital.

Two 15-year-old girls who were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter have been bailed until September pending further inquiries.

A police source confirmed that youngsters may have been smoking behind the building moments before the fire started.

Mr Hunt’s family paid tribute to him, saying: ‘Stephen was an old-fashioned gentleman with manners that are rare in this day and age, with core values which included loving his family, being the best father that he could be, loving and affectionate to those that were close to him.

‘Stephen lived to serve his country 
having served for seven years in the Royal Signals and then becoming a 
firefighter, which was a career that he was very proud of.

‘The
whole family will miss spending time with Stephen, none more so than 
his son, daughter and grandmother. We loved his sense of humour and are 
very proud of him and what he brought to our lives.’

Support: The family kept close together as they read well-wishes and tributes from others

The fire broke out on Saturday 
afternoon in a basement store-room at the warehouse, which supplies hair
extensions and hair products.

Witness Ava Smart said: ‘People came 
running outside. I asked them what happened and they said someone was 
standing out the back smoking.

‘It happened so fast. It was horrendous.’

Owner Paul Barnett desperately tried to tackle the blaze with an off-duty fireman, but both were overcome and were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation.

Store manager Nicola Purcell said: ‘They did everything they could with extinguishers and water until the fire brigade arrived.

‘Paul wasn’t well enough to come down today but wanted to pay his respects and asked the staff to lay flowers.’

The fire spread rapidly and around 
five hours later at 8.30pm a ‘BA emergency’ was declared – a signal for 
everybody to evacuate the building.

The fire service are still tackling the blaze and said the complex layout of the building has hindered efforts

The fire broke out at Paul's Hair World on Saturday afternoon and more than 60 firefighters were sent to the scene

Steve McGuirk, Manchester’s county 
fire officer, said: ‘We had some real problems. This was a building 
stacked full of hair products, chemicals and a huge amount of 
combustible materials.

‘For some reason we don’t know, the 
situation rapidly deteriorated and we took the decision to evacuate the 
building. 

'It was during this evacuation that two firefighters  were 
pulled out by colleagues. First aid was given and they were whipped off 
to hospital, but tragically Stephen was declared dead on arrival.’

Fire service paid tribute to Mr Hunt (not pictured) and his colleague's 'professionalism and courage'

He said Mr Hunt appeared to have been enveloped by ‘an absolutely massive, ferocious and sudden build-up of heat’.

He did not rule out that it may have 
been generated by steam or chemicals inside the building. He added: ‘We 
are devastated by the loss of one of our colleagues in the line  of 
duty.

‘It brings home the dangers that our firefighters put themselves in every day to keep the community safe.’

The fire was still being damped down 
yesterday, while flags at fire stations all over Greater Manchester flew
at half mast, including the one at Philips Park where Mr Hunt was 
based.
