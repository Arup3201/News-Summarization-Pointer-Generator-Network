Len McCluskey, Unite's firebrand general secretary, has also tried  to dictate who Mr Miliband has in his Shadow Cabinet

The majority of Labour’s candidates picked so far for the 2015 General Election are linked to unions, it emerged yesterday.

Of the 42 candidates selected, 23 have union links.

Of those, 16 won their candidacies with direct backing from unions while a further seven are union members. Unite – Labour’s biggest donor – sponsors a quarter of those who have made it this far.

Among those picked to battle for parliamentary seats are a campaigns officer from Unison and two former GMB officials.

Union donations still account for 81 per cent of Labour’s funds – pouring in £20million to the party since their votes helped Mr Miliband secure the party leadership ahead of his brother David in 2010.

The influence of trade unions over the party’s would-be MPs undermines Mr Miliband’s attempts to throw off his ‘Red Ed’ label, and new rules mean that in future it is even more likely that candidates will be drawn from union backgrounds. 

They now have to give up their jobs for at least nine weeks before an election – up from four weeks – and they also have to prove they have more spare cash to cover campaign costs than before, according to Peter Watt, Labour’s former general secretary.

He described the union’s involvement in the selection process as a ‘stitch up’ earlier this month and senior Labour sources are concerned that this means only those with union sponsorship will be able to afford to fight for a seat.

Len McCluskey, Unite’s firebrand general secretary, has also tried  to dictate who Mr Miliband has in his Shadow Cabinet.

Yesterday he issued threats to the Labour leader, telling the New Statesman magazine that he will be ‘cast into the dustbin of history’ if he is ‘seduced’ by the Blairites in his shadow cabinet, such as Jim Murphy, Liam Byrne and Douglas Alexander.

Unite has also openly declared it wants to stop more moderate candidates being selected by the party for plum seats. In minutes from its December meeting, the union claimed it had ‘changed the Labour Party rule book’ to ‘end discrimination against working-class candidates’. 

The union said that without its support, candidates from the Blairite ‘Progress’ branch of the party ‘or other right-wing candidates’ would have been selected.

The rules now decree that all candidates have to be a member of a trade union ‘and contribute to the political fund of that union’. 

Labour has tried to distance itself from Mr McClusky’s statements, saying: ‘[He] does not speak for the Labour Party. This attempt to divide the party is reprehensible.’ 

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said last night: ‘The attack on Len McCluskey is just cosmetic spin. If Ed Miliband is so outraged, he should hand back the £8million he’s poured into Labour coffers and stop taking money from his union paymasters.’

Labour denied it was drawing its candidates from too narrow a field. A spokesman said: ‘We are proud to have selected a wide range of candidates with varying backgrounds. 

‘Our affiliates’ support does not get them any undue influence over our candidate selection process.’

Nearly 80 per cent of the Shadow Cabinet has received money from trade unions since the last General Election, according to figures which reveal their grip on the upper echelons of the Labour Party.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, his deputy Harriet Harman – who is married to former trade unionist and Labour MP Jack Dromey – and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls have all received union sponsorship, the Electoral Commission register reveals.  

Mr Miliband raked in a £100,000 and a £15,0000 payment from Unite, as well as money from the GMB union and UCATT, which represents construction workers.

Labour’s business spokesman Chuka Umunna received cash from the GMB and Community unions.

Out of 29 MPs who can attend Shadow Cabinet, 23 have accepted union donations.

While Mr Umunna used the cash to pay for staff, the money can be used for a variety of causes including campaigning. 

High profile Shadow Cabinet members not to have accepted union money since 2010 are Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves, and Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary.
