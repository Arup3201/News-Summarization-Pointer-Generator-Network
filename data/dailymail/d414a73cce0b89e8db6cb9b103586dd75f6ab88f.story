Woolworths has admitted it is still placing orders with a Bangladeshi textile company after one of their factories caught fire, killing seven workers.

The company published the names and addresses of 52 Bangladeshi factories that Woolworths' retail brands source from.

Bangladesh's poorly-regulated garment industry has been scrutinised of late following a string of industrial disasters and Woolworths said they posted the supplier factory list on their website for 'transparency reasons'.

A Bangladeshi factory in Gazipur burnt down in October, killing seven workers after a chimney caught fire. The factory's company, Aswad Composite Mills, is listed as one of Woolworths' suppliers

'The list is currently complete and up-to-date,' a spokeswoman told MailOnline.

Aswad Composite Mills is listed as one of Woolworths' suppliers. It is part of the Palmal Group, which is one of Bangladesh's largest clothing manufacturers.

Aswad's Gazipur factory burnt down in October, killing seven workers after a chimney caught fire.

'The Aswad factory listed on our website does not refer to the factory where the fire occurred last year. We did not source directly from that factory,' the spokeswoman said. 

At the time of the blaze, Woolworths said it could not rule out that it sourced material from the company because it ordered through Palmal.

Ahead of the fire, the factory was not one of the 1,600 sites to be inspected under a fire and safety accord because it was not a clothing factory that dealt directly with brands

A spokeswoman said Woolworths had become a signatory of the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety in the month the fire gutted the factory.

'We signed the Accord in October 2013 and pledged to work with other signatories to improve the safety of garment workers in Bangladesh,' she said.

'Palmal factories are signatories of the Accord and our understanding is that all Accord members are producing in line with Bangladeshi law.'

Woolworths said it has audited all of its supply factories in Bangladesh in the past year.

'We utilise the services of third-party auditing companies,' she said.

But Oxfam said audit fraud was common across Asia and using third party companies did not guarantee an independent result.

'Factories can keep double books, and workers might be afraid to speak. We don't see that as truly independent, it's not good enough,' Oxfam's corporate accountability and fair trade adviser, Daisy Gardener, told Fairfax Media.

Oxfam is now encouraging Woolworths to list its supplier factories in other countries.

The Gazipur factory also made material for Kmart, Target, and Just Group.

Kmart was the first Australian company to disclose its supplier factories in Bangladesh in December.

Target and Pacific Brands, which sells Bonds and Berlei, committed to publishing their list of supplier locations this year.

Bangladesh's poorly-regulated garment industry has been scrutinised of late following a string of industrial disasters, including this factory collapse in the country's capital Dhaka in April last year
