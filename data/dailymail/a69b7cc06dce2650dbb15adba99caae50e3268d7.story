Alan Pardew says his Christmas-day gravy might taste a little bit lumpy if he loses the Tyne-Wear derby – a match he describes as the biggest he’s ever been involved in.

Newcastle face Sunderland at St James’ Park on Sunday in the final fixture before Christmas.

Pardew has lost the last three derbies and would become the first manager in the club’s history to suffer defeat in four should the result go against them this weekend.

The United boss, though, says he cannot wait to do battle with their North-East rivals.

‘I’ve been lucky enough to play in cup finals, but if any manager asked me, “What’s the biggest game you’ve been involved in?”, I’d say Newcastle versus Sunderland,' he said.

‘The electricity of this game really is something else, and you have to be at it to appreciate it. I’m looking forward to experiencing that again.

‘The end, not so much if you lose. Particularly around Christmas time when it’s goodwill to all men, the gravy is going to be a bit lumpy if we lose. So it’s important to win.’

Of the back-to-back 3-0 defeats on Tyneside, he added: 'We made mistakes and they punished us. We weren’t patient enough and they played a similar game to how they will play on Sunday, playing deep and looking to hurt us on the break.

'Their average pass to the goal was two passes before they scored and that tells you everything about the way they capitalise on your errors. We’ve got to make sure we don’t make errors.'

Meanwhile, Newcastle's programme cover ahead of Sunday is sure to be a talking point.

It pictures former Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback in a black-and-white shirt with his hand on his heart.

Colback scored for Sunderland during their 3-0 win last season and, following his controversial move to United, the Black Cats tweeted a picture of his celebration at St James', although this was later deleted.
