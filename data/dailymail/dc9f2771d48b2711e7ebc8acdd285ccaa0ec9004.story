Even when it's raining, Elaine Frazer refuses her husband's offer of a lift to work. She'd rather take the 20-minute walk because she is determined to stay well.

The 45-year-old shop assistant from Lisburn in Northern Ireland hasn't always been so conscientious about her health. For years until recently she often spent her evenings on the sofa munching fatty snacks in front of the TV, even after a meal.

By her late 30s she was 16st. At 5ft 10in her BMI was over 32 - officially obese. 'I felt sluggish and tired, but I put it down to the fact I was getting older.'

Then when she was 40, she noticed a lump by her right nipple. To her horror, tests showed it was breast cancer.

'They told me they had caught it early, but all I could think about was my son, Anthony. He was only 14, and I just kept thinking: "I'm never going to see him grow up or have a family",' says Elaine, who is married to Michael, 53, a printer.

After her diagnosis in September 2009, Elaine underwent a lumpectomy, chemotherapy and then, in February 2010, radiotherapy.

Doctors gave her a good prognosis, but she was concerned that the cancer might return. She was told she'd be given the drug tamoxifen and six-monthly mammograms, but she wanted more reassurance.

Then, in March 2010, during an appointment a doctor said something that resonated. 'She said: "You have another chance at life if you change your lifestyle." It really hit home.'

There are more cancer survivors like Elaine than ever before - two million in the UK. Forty years ago, three-quarters of people diagnosed with cancer died within ten years. Now, according to the latest figures from Cancer Research UK, half of all those diagnosed with cancer will be alive ten years later.

However, people who have had cancer once are statistically more likely to get it again. This may be because the treatment itself, such as radiotherapy, increases the risk of another cancer, or because the lifestyle factor that contributed to their cancer in the first place is still not addressed.

They are also more prone to other diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and osteoporosis. This, too, can sometimes be due to cancer treatment.

For example certain cancer drugs weaken bones, raising the risk of osteoporosis; and women who have had breast cancer treatment are prone to putting on weight due to steroid or hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen, and this may increase the risk of diabetes.

A report published last week by the charity Macmillan Cancer Support revealed that one in four patients faces long-term illness or disability as a result of treatment for the disease.

Now, however, scientists are starting to identify what can be done to help keep former cancer patients well and reduce their risk of cancer returning.

'Research has been accelerating rapidly,' says Dr Kate Wolin, an epidemiologist based at Loyola University, Chicago, who has studied how to improve quantity and quality of life for cancer survivors.

'Whereas the World Cancer Research Fund [the global authority on cancer] has been issuing advice on cancer prevention for years, only in the past two years have they issued advice on survivorship as they feel they finally have enough information to make recommendations.'

These include eating a largely plant-based diet, maintaining a healthy weight and getting regular physical activity.

Following these guidelines can reduce the risk of cancer recurring two to three fold, and can reduce the risk of illness from cancer or other causes by 34 per cent, says Dr Sorrell Burden, a dietitian who has conducted cancer research and works at Central Manchester University Hospitals.

Meanwhile, a study published in the British Journal of Cancer in 2012 found that a diet with a high intake of vegetables, fruit, vegetable oil, and soups reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 29 per cent compared with a standard Western diet high in red and processed meat and deep fried foods.

Why is still not clear, but one emerging theory is that these foods trigger inflammation, which can boost cancer cell growth.

But it is physical activity that provides some of the best evidence for helping cancer survivors. The authors of a report for Macmillan Cancer Care refer to it as the 'underrated wonder drug'.

Last year experts at Macmillan calculated that walking a mile a day at a steady 3mph - roughly a 30-minute walk - could cut the risk of breast cancer recurring by 40 per cent. And for women actually undergoing breast cancer treatment it could cut the risk of dying from the disease by 40 per cent.

Meanwhile, a U.S. study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2011, which followed more than 2,000 prostate cancer survivors over 18 years, found that those who did more than three hours a week of vigorous activity such as swimming, tennis or cycling cut their risk of dying from their cancer by 61 per cent.

Bowel cancer patients who do around six hours of moderate intensity physical activity a week such as cycling, jogging or walking could help reduce their risk of dying from the disease by around 50 per cent, according to a review of 60 studies entitled The Impact of Physical Activity on Improving Cancer Survivorship.

Quite why exercise should be so effective at preventing cancer returning is unclear, says Professor Jane Maher a consultant oncologist and joint medical officer for Macmillan. It's not simply about keeping weight down (being overweight is a risk factor for some cancers, including breast).

'Physical activity has an impact as it can reduce levels of hormones such as oestrogen that are known to stimulate cancer. Another theory is that exercise reduces inflammation and makes it harder for cancer cells to take hold and grow.'

For Dr Wolin, 'the surprising thing is that despite this new emerging research about the benefits of lifestyle, researchers' focus is still on drugs - unlike drugs, lifestyle options have no side-effects and the benefits are enormous'.

Indeed a healthy lifestyle can have an effect 'comparable to drugs,' adds Professor Maher. 'That is not to say they can replace them - but they do have a comparable effect.'

She now encourages all but her very ill patients to stay active throughout their treatment and beyond. 'Having looked at the data I now always recommend physical activity,' she says.

'Walking can make a big difference and it is so simple. You don't have to slip into Lycra and go to the gym every day to make this impact, any form of physical activity helps.'

Considering the benefits from diet and exercise, experts say not enough patients are issued with this advice. Currently, only those with certain types of cancer, for instance colon or stomach, are routinely given advice about what to eat, says Dr Burden.

'At the moment patients often get their advice from the TV or the media or magazines, whereas it would be better if it came from health professionals.'

And yet a survey by Macmillan of 400 health professionals, found that one in ten still believed it more important for patients to rest during treatment - when the key seems to be staying active not just after treatment but during it, too. Only 6 per cent tell patients of the benefits of physical activity - and half admit they know little if anything about the benefits for cancer patients.

Professor Maher says things have improved slightly since this survey was conducted in 2011, with more GPs and oncologists now giving exercise advice, but adds: 'It is still the case that advice about exercise is not being included in information for patients.'

U.S. research shows that support is crucial, with those given counselling about how to lose weight and get more physically active, having lower levels of an inflammatory marker linked to breast cancer, than those just given a leaflet.

Yet too often a leaflet is all that patients such as Elaine get.

'I didn't really know what I should or should not be eating, so looked it up in books and on the internet,' she says. 'Before cancer, my only vegetable intake was maybe some carrots with dinner, but now half my plate is vegetables of all kinds.' She also started walking, aiming to take 10,000 steps a day.

Now 45, she used every ounce of determination to slim down to 13st. 'When I went for my five years check-up the nurse said I had done really well and that by taking the weight off, and getting more active I had substantially reduced my risk of the cancer returning.

'If I hadn't changed my lifestyle - it could have been very different.'
