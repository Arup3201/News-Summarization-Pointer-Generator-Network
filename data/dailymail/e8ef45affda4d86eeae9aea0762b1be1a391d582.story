A blind Native American, 69, is accusing staff at a local hospital of negligence and racism after he emerged from open heart surgery with scars all over his body which appeared to spell out KKK.

Vernon Traversie, from Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in South Dakota, had a heart attack last August and was rushed to Rapid City Regional Hospital.

After surgery he was in a lot of pain. Mr Traversie said he told one of the male nurses he needed medication and claims he was abusive towards him. This was on top of the scarring from surgery.

Rapid City police say they conducted an investigation but found no evidence of a crime.

Though he complained, no one did anything about it.

'I told them I had a confrontation with a male nurse while I was in intensive care,' he said. 'I was in so much pain, I begged him for pain medication.

'He told me to shut my f***ing mouth or he’d shut it for me. I didn’t provoke him. I didn’t disrespect him.'

When he asked to be sent to a rehabilitation center because the pain was so bad, they said this was approved - but instead discharged him.

On the day he was discharged, a nurse at the hospital told Mr Traversie that he should get someone to take a picture of the surgery scars on his stomach and his back.

The nurse said she would not testify on his behalf but couldn't live with herself without at least alerting him to the scars.

She said to him: 'My conscience won’t let me be. It’s bothered me for days. Something was done to you, and I believe it was wrong.

'I can’t sleep. I keep thinking about what they did to you.'

His pastor came over the following day and took pictures of his abdomen and back and continued to throughout the healing process to document it.

An open heart surgery wound is typically between five and ten inches long. There may be slight scarring or bruising from surgical tape around it.

In Mr Traversie's case, he has deep wounds all over his stomach and some on his back. Several of the wounds look in the shape of the letter K.

He told the Indian Country Today Media Network: 'You can see the surgery sutures, and they’re clean.

'But those three letters, two good-sized Ks and one smaller one off to the side, had to be made with some sharp knife or heated instrument. It’s like they branded me.'

Scars: Mr Traversie had an old wound reopened on his back and two more cuts above it. On his abdomen the letters K can be seen

Point out: A YouTube video made about his story shows where the K letters are for those who do not recognize them. It was a nurse who first alerted Mr Traversie to the scars

A friend of the 69-year-old who made a YouTube video about the case, said they also cut down through an existing surgery scar and carved two vertical lines above the older scar.

The hospital have attributed the extra wounds to surgical tape or to infections related to his diabetes. 

Since the video of what happened to the Native American was posted online, hundreds of people have expressed their shock and disgust over what happened and took to the streets on Monday to protest.

Supporters, led by American Indian Movement founder Dennis Banks, marched for two miles waving American Indian flags from rapid City plaza to the hospital where Mr Traversie was operated on.

Hap Marshall, 69, a resident of the Cheyenne River reservation, said: 'We’re classified as second class citizens. But when they want our votes, we’re their brother.'

A group of about 15 people - including Banks and Oglala Sioux Vice President Tom Poor Bear - met with officials at the hospital, while police prevented other supporters from entering the building.

The hospital released a statement saying: 'We believe the meeting with leaders of the rally yesterday provided an opportunity to learn more about each other’s perspectives.

'Rapid City Regional Hospital is an organization of people who have dedicated our lives to healing others. We are deeply committed to providing excellent care to everyone, regardless of race. No one at RCRH would stand by idly and allow abuse to occur in this hospital. 

'We proactively seek feedback from patients and we listen to their concerns. Upon admission, patients are provided a document outlining their rights and who to call if they have concerns. Administration, Directors, and Supervisors routinely visit with patients, inquire about their care, and answer any questions.

'Our Patient Relations team works with patients to address individual concerns. Additionally, we have a team of people who randomly survey patients about their care they received once the patient returns home.

'In the rare instances when a patient has a complaint, we investigate it thoroughly. If a patient files a complaint with local law enforcement or an outside regulatory organization, then we fully cooperate in the investigation with all local, state, or federal agencies.

'Once again, in the absence of a written release, we are severely restricted from commenting on the care of any patient. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss the specifics of any case if allowed to do so by the patient or their representative.

'We at RCRH are confident of the care we provide without bias or consideration of race, religion, national origin or payer classification.'

A Justice for Traversie Facebook page has been set up to highlight what happened, as has an online petition.
