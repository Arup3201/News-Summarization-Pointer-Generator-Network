Violation: Local ABC affiliate anchor Jessica Miles is suing Minnesota state and local agencies after learning her personal drivers license information has been illegally accessed 1,380 times by nosy public employees

A Minnesota news anchor has filed suit against state and local government agencies after discovering her driver's license info has been illegally viewed over a thousand times.

Midday anchor at KSTP Jessica Miles has learned that her private data was viewed around 1,380 times by upwards of 180 different area government departments, likely by public employees who are also viewers eager to peek into the private life of TV figure whose beautiful face graces millions of Twin City television each day.

Hers is the latest in at least 20 alleged cases of public employees accessing restricted information on their family and friends, television  personalities, and even political foes.

The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports 
that Miles' records have been illegally accessed more than anyone else 
thus far, which could mean a big payoff for the local news anchor.

'On
July 30, 2013, Jessica was shocked and disgusted,' reads the lawsuit, 
which came to light Monday, 'to learn from (the Department of Public Safety) that it had determined 
that officers and personnel from approximately 180 different departments
and agencies had reviewed and improperly obtained or used her private 
data.'

Miles' husband Cory Kampschroer, who was reportedly looked up 92 times by public employees, is also part of the lawsuit.

Pretty: Miles' job at KSTP puts her pretty face in the homes of millions in the Twin Cities area all week long. Her lawsuit alleges that 1,380 of those viewers wanted a sort of peek inside her home

Pricey snooping: Miles' husband Cory Kampschroer works with Miles at KSTP and is also part of the suit, which could win the couple over $3.5M as per a federal statute that provides such victims be paid $2,500 per violation

Cute couple: The media power duo's life in the public spotlight likely egged on public employees curious about what goes on behind the scenes

For
each violation, which number over 1,450 between them, federal law 
provides the couple be paid $2,500. All told, that would win them the 
tidy sum of $3.5 million.

But their attorney Kenneth Fukuda isn't stopping there.

The
suit is also seeking damages for 'emotional distress, loss of peace of 
mind and any action [Miles] has had to take to remedy the situation.'

Abuse? Another suit by local politicians like Republican State Representative Steve Drazkowski claims the public employees are accessing their info to dig up dirt on political foes

The suit states that in 2008, Miles received word that her driver's license info had been accessed. When she called the Driver and Vehicle Services department, a director Patricia McCormack assured her it was a one time breach by a 'curious' employee who had since been punished.

But a week later, someone entered an area bank and was able to swap out Miles' bank card and gain access to her account by using her name.

'McCormack fraudulently concealed from Jessica the massive extent' of the data breach, according to the suit.

Miles has declined to comment on the case through her attorney.

In a statement, the DPS director of communications Bruce Gordon wrote: 'We can’t comment on pending litigation, and we have yet to see the lawsuit.' 

Last week, a state politician made headlines when he filed suit, along with 18 others, against Wabasha County police and other officials.

The Pioneer Press reports that Rep. Steve Drazkowski and the other plaintiffs, all of them politically active, allege the groups accessed their data in order to dig up dirt.

For his part, Drazkowski, a Republican, says the groups sought to somehow damage his reputation in retaliation for his stances on the local prison and union contract.

The group claims about 600 combined illegal accesses of their information.
