Sergio Aguero's attempts to follow compatriot Diego Maradona by scoring his own 'glove of God' backfired as the Manchester City striker's handball subterfuge was spotted, punished and left him public enemy number one at Stoke's raucous Britannia Stadium.

Despite putting in a match-winning performance for his title-chasing side and his first goals since December 3, Aguero will be remembered for something other than an impressive return to form following a knee injury.

True, he didn't try to con the referee with an over-the-top celebration as Maradona did when he rose above Peter Shilton to score the first goal against England at the 1986 World Cup with his palm.

The City striker could have headed it in following good work from David Silva but put the ball in with his hand

Nevertheless, the striker did clearly use the fingers inside his gloved left hand for a final touch on a goal that would have put Manchester City 2-1 ahead on the stroke of half-time.

As Manchester City players loudly acclaimed the goal awarded by referee Lee Mason, a sheepish Aguero kept quiet as Stoke players vented angry protests, particularly from Marc Muniesa, the defender closest to the action.

In the end, Mr Mason was persuaded to consult with his assistant and having clearly gleaned the correct information, disallowed the goal.

Aguero wasn't allowed to forget his indiscretion by the Stoke fans, regarded as among the most partisan in the Premier League. When the whistle blew for half-time with the score still at 1-1 moments later, every step he took towards the dressing-room was greeted with widespread boos and the occasional howl of abuse.

The odd thing is Aguero didn't even need to handle to score. Silva's low cross flipped up in the air and Muniesa tried to intercept, Aguero's first touch with his head was goalbound but only a yard from goal his left arm seemed to involuntarily move up and his hand gave the ball a final shove.

Presumably the forward will claim he couldn't get his hand out the way but even so he will now go alongside other South American greats Luis Suarez and Maradona.

Of course, Aguero's sleight of hand won't be remembered in 30 years time like Maradona's because it was ruled out and didn't prove decisive in any case – largely because he scored twice anyway.

Aguero had failed to find the net since returning from a knee injury sustained against Everton but a cold Wednesday night in Stoke proved the time to put the cobwebs away.

City's goal to open the scoring after half-an-hour was brilliant. Aguero outmuscled Muniesa on the halfway line to collect a punt from James Milner, accelerated past Phil Bardsley and shot cleanly across Asmir Begovic.

Peter Crouch then equalised with a trademark header past Joe Hart to deservedly level the scoreline. 

Milner then headed the visitors in front and when Manchester City were awarded a penalty, Aguero rifled it into the roof of the net for his 21st goal of the season.

Stoke fans might not like him but his own fans chanted 'Sergio, Sergio' as he made way for Edin Dzeko with the game won.

The exciting thing for City is Aguero can only get better with new signing Wilfried Bony due to line up alongside him in their next game in 10 days time.

Barcelona, who await in the Champions League, will be worried. Even without his hands, Aguero is deadly.
