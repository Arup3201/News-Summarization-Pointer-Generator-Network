He is the self-proclaimed 'pick-up coach' who has been banned from the UK, Australia and Singapore after being accused of promoting sexual assault - admitting he is the 'most hated man in the world'.

Julien Blanc's techniques include telling women to save him the effort and spike their own drinks, prompting the Australian Government to kick him out and the British to tell him he was unwelcome.  

Part of the 26-year-old’s technique has been to create an air of mystery, with extremely little known about his background.

But a MailOnline investigation can disclose that Blanc is in fact from a small, suburban Swiss town called Lully, where his parents still live and remain proud of him.

At the family home in the Swiss canton of Vaud - best known for its wine production - Julien's mother Lauren, who is American and originally hails from Seattle, broke her silence and said: 'I want to say that we are very supportive of him.

Controversial: Julien Blanc has been kicked out of Australia and banned from the UK. He's a Swiss native, living in the U.S. where he has dual nationality as his mother is originally from Seattle, Washington State

'We are supportive of Julien and I feel that the journalists around the world have not done their job, up until now they have never bothered to look into what his work really is.

'But that's a mother's personal opinion.'

Last month, Blanc, 26,was banned from the UK for allegedly encouraging violence against women. He was similarly banned from Australia and Singapore after footage emerged of him using racist language and grabbing women by the throat.

Working as an 'executive coach' for a company called Real Social Dynamics as an 'international leader in dating advice', Julien claims to teach men to seduce women and make them 'beg' for sex. 

Critics say his methods, such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends, are abusive and controlling.

Blanc has successfully been running $1,800-a-head seminars across the globe despite his own admission he is the 'most hated man in the world'.  

One post from his Twitter account, now made private, said: 'Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie [spike] your own drink? #JustKidding.' 

In November, he was due to run a seminar in Britain, but more than 136,000 people signed a petition for him to be refused a visa and Home Office ministers were forced to intervene.

At the time, Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone said: 'Julien Blanc's presence in the UK could have led to an increase in sexual violence and harassment. I am delighted that Mr Blanc won't be coming to our shores.' 

For a man who has caused such uproar, however, Blanc has had a very modest upbringing.

He was born on October 24, 1988, in Morges, Switzerland, to parents Lauren and Thierry Blanc, who married in Washington state in August 1986. Two years later, in October 1990, the couple welcomed daughter Marielle.

Lauren's American nationality explains how Blanc, who is believed to live in Los Angeles, has been able to live and work in the U.S. with such ease.

Mrs Blanc, 56, works for her local town hall, while in July 2011, her husband was understood to have been given the prestigious job of Director General of Health in Geneva. The couple have a quiet life and are members of their local choir.

Growing up, Blanc was a pupil at Beausobre College in Morges. A fellow student Léonore Porchet was stunned to see her former schoolmate hit the headlines, writing on Facebook that she was 'extremely shocked' by his antics, saying: 'The behavior of this bloke is unacceptable and constitutes a very serious attack on women's physical and moral integrity.

She added: 'Former classmates, yes, it is indeed Julien Blanc, who we used to hang out with on the school benches. Yes, stalkers and dangerous men can be the 'guy next door.'

And she added: 'Don't hesitate to warn people about the different sides of his character.' 

Despite his friends' shock and his parents more sedate life, he's not the only member of the family to court controversy. His sister Marielle is making a name for her slightly risque art.

Pictures of blow up dolls feature in her work, and in January, Marielle posted a video of performance art in Lausanne, Switzerland, called Sois belle et tais-toi!” (Be beautiful and shut up).

She wrote: 'This was an artistic performance in a public square in the centre of Lausanne, Switzerland. For two hours, I stood on a pedestal with my lips drawn stapled shut. My friends interviewed passers-by for their opinion of that quote.'

Sources now say Marielle is in Canada studying at University for her Masters. 

Since his ban from the UK last month, Blanc has not been seen in public. 

When asked if Julien would be spending Christmas with his family at their semi-detached home, his mother said: 'I do not know. I really do not know.'

Mr Blanc, 56, declined to speak about his son. However, his wife said he is handling the fallout of his travel bans, saying: 'Julien is dealing with it on his own.' 

And she made it clear that her son has gone to ground saying: 'You'll find his email on the internet but he will not respond.' 

On Blanc's website, he admits: 'I wasn’t a popular kid' and posts pictures of himself as a somewhat geeky teen. 

Travelling: Julien Blanc left his parents' home in Lully to move to the U.S. and travel the globe teaching his dating tricks

Student: Julien Blanc was a pupil at Beausobre College in Morges, Switzerland. A fellow pupil who studied with him expressed shock after he hit the headlines.

But he says his life turned around after he read The Game by Neil Strauss, the 'bible of pickup'. He went on to train with RSD co-founder and dating coach Tyler Durden - real name Owen Cook - for two years.

Cook named himself after Brad Pitt's character in the movie Fight Club after adopting an outrageous and cavalier persona.

Blanc now boasts: 'Since then, I’ve traveled the world teaching literally THOUSANDS of clients.' 

He says he teaches men 'how to pick up the hottest women, in the hardest venues, and the results have been nothing short of phenomenal for my students.'

His website says men can 'shortcircuit' a woman's 'logical mind' to get her into bed.  

He also reposted a chart used by support groups to identify signs of domestic abuse with the words: 'May as well be a checklist. #HowToMakeHerStay.'

On his website he says people taught by him can 'make girls BEG to sleep with you after short-circuiting their emotional and logical mind into a million reasons why they should'.

It promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'.

But videos and pictures of Blanc in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them.

A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him urging men in the audience not to bother being 'polite' to Japanese women - but instead 'grab girls and shove their head' into their 'crotch.' 

In the wake of his UK ban, Blanc issued an apology, telling CNN's Chris Cuomo: 'I just want to apologise to anyone I’ve offended in any way. This was never my intention and I just want to put it out there.

'I’m extremely sorry. Like, I feel horrible. I’m not going to be happy to feel like I’m the most hated man in the world. I’m overwhelmed by the way people are responding.' His critics were largely unimpressed with the apology.'

Workplace: Julien Blanc's mother, Lauren Blanc, works at the Lully town council 

But Jennnifer Li, who led an online campaign against Blanc under the hashtag #takedownjulienblanc, told BuzzFeed that Blanc’s apology was 'full of s**t'.

'He is sorry he got caught, not for what he has done,' Li said.

When Cuomo challenged Blanc, noting his materials and seminars have explicitly taught men to use potentially abusive or racist tactics to attract women, Blanc added: 'My intentions were never bad,” Blanc said. He said his materials have been taken 'out of context' and that a photo of him with his hand around a woman’s throat was a 'horrible attempt at humor'.

Asked about Blanc’s antics, his U.S. relatives firmly declined to comment.

And whether he decides to come out of hiding for a family Christmas in Switzerland remains to be seen.
