Today, Ellie-May's devastated family paid tribute to the girl they say looked like 1930s Hollywood child star Shirley Temple.

'Ellie-May used to love cups of tea and there was a little saying her mum used to sing to her every time she picked her up - "Ellie-May every day drinking tea".

'She was tiny and had blonde ringlets like Shirley Temple and her eyes were so blue like the sky. She was so small but loved an argument - she loved to disagree!

'She was so loved and is missed - she was cherished by everyone. Her memory will never die and we will never forget her. She is now in Heaven with her uncle Michael.'

The tragedy unfolded at Oaks View Caravan Park in Upper Arncott, Oxfordshire, at 4.55pm on Saturday.

Ellie-May has a brother, Patrick, aged five, and a sister, Bridget-Marie, aged three years.
