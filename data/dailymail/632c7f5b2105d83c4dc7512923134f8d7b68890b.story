A series of eco-dwellings made from reclaimed materials and shaped like giant eggs have been created by designers.

The houseboats, floating lodges and beach houses are to be crafted from reclaimed materials from a previous project by designers BMT Asia Pacific.

The company had originally used the idea to build a dome to protect radar and radio antennae for a new landmark cruise liner terminal in Hong Kong.

But they decided to give the concept a 'second life' after spending so much time creating, developing and sourcing material.

BMT Asia Pacific have designed a series houseboats, floating lodges and beach houses which are in the shape of an egg

Managing director Richard Colwill said BMT looked at ways to use the two moulds which formed the dome.

They examined the prospect of using them as swimming pools and temporary stages, but ended up creating the waterborne and coastal structures.

The buildings, which are the first models in the Sea-Suite series, were designed by Richard Colwill and Henry Ward of Henry Ward Design.

The first plan is for a floating lodge in the shape of the mould's original egg-like structure.

The idea for the buildings came from a previous project to build a dome to protect radar and radio antennae for a cruise liner terminal in Hong Kong

A spokesman said: 'Expansive but shaded windows flood the 6m high lounge with light from either side, while decking creates easy access to the water.

'The luxury space is envisaged as easily at home along lake or river side, or a part of a cluster hotel or studio development.

'The high levels of roof insulation, moderation of temperature from its water setting and potential addition of solar panels to the expansive roof creates a sustainable unit for all climates.'

Taking the concept a step further the design team went for a houseboat.

The team even designed a houseboat, which was achieved by 'cracking' the egg

This was achieved by 'cracking' the egg, raising and separating the top shell, which has been sculpted to form a terracotta roof edged with flowing curves.

This has created an airy loft style houseboat with stepped mezzanine levels leading up to a master bedroom, featuring expansive views through full height windows.

Mr Colwill said the shape provided a number of exciting opportunities.

He said: 'In the same way that an egg provides a flexible base for many recipes, we see countless opportunities in the development of this design for private or commercial use.'
