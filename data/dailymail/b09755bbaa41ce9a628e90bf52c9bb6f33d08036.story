Down to work: Helle Thorning-Schmidt arrives at the Danish parliament this morning

Neil Kinnock is finally getting a taste of leading a country - after his daughter-in-law swept to victory to become Denmark's first female Prime Minister.

Helle Thorning-Schmidt, dubbed a 'Gucci diva' for her penchant for designer clothes, led a 'Red bloc' of parties to oust centre-right Lars Loekke Rasmussen from office.

It came despite allegations, published days before the election, that saw her forced to dismiss rumours she had separated from her husband and that he was gay.

She now begins the tricky task of 
piecing together a centre-Left government - to deal with the country's 
growing economic crisis.

Celebrating with supporters in the early hours of this morning, the 44-year-old, who married the former Labour leader's son Stephen in 1996, said: 'We did it. Today is a day of change.

'Make no mistake: We have written history. Today there's a change of guards in Denmark.'

It followed a speech from Ramussen, who said: 'There is no parliamentary support for our government.

'So tonight I hand over the keys to the prime minister's office to Helle Thorning-Schmidt. And dear Helle, take good care of them. You're only borrowing them.'

Her father-in-law famously lost to John Major's Conservatives in the 1992 general election after leading the polls for months.

While
he blamed sustained personal attacks on him by the press, critics said 
voters were turned off by Labour’s tax plans and his premature triumphalism at a Sheffield party rally.

There had been fears that his son's wife could suffer from the same 'Kinnock curse' in the lead-up to polling day.

But Social Democrat Thorning-Schmidt's 'Red bloc' won a slim majority of five seats in Denmark's 179-seat parliament. Turnout was a high 87.7 per cent.

She said she would start government 
formation talks today with the Social Liberals, the left-wing Socialist 
People's Party and the far-left party, the Red-Green Alliance.

She is not likely to make any major changes, but has promised to overhaul a system of beefed-up customs controls at borders with Germany and Sweden.

Critics have said they violate the spirit of EU agreements on the free movement of people and goods.

She is also expected to roll back some of the austerity measures introduced amid Europe's debt crisis, campaigning on a platform of tax rises and increased public spending.

She has also advocated making everyone work 12 minutes more per day to boost the country's productivity, Reuters news agency reports.

An extra hour of productivity each week, the Social Democrats argue, would help kick-start growth.

The economic crisis has turned Denmark's healthy surpluses into deficits, estimated to climb to 4.6 per cent of GDP next year.

Local banks have also been struggling, with nine taken over by the state since the start of the crisis in 2008.

Ms Thorning-Schmidt has accused Mr Rasmussen of failing to spur growth and allowing the deficit to grow. The victory comes four years after her party slumped to their worst result in a century, with just 25.5 per cent of the votes.

As leader, she said: 'Danes need more time before they hand over responsibility to us.'

Thorning-Schmidt gained a master's 
degree in political science from Copenhagen University in 1994. Two 
years later, she married Stephen Kinnock, whom she met in Belgium.

She lives with their two daughters, Johanna, 14, and Camilla, 11, in northern Copenhagen, while Kinnock is based in Switzerland as a director of the World Economic Forum.

The couple hit the headlines last week after two Danish newspapers published, in the days before the election, details of alleged problems with her marriage.

A Swedish newspaper, Expressen, also questioned Mr Kinnock’s sexuality.

Her relationship with Mr Kinnock had 
been a subject of speculation for some time, with whispers fuelled by 
the fact he spends most of the year living and working in another 
country.

But 
Thorning-Schmidt responded by saying: 'I can only say it is not true. It
is very unpleasant that newspapers print such rumours and I am also 
sorry that generally there are these rumours about politicians.

'It’s really uncomfortable, also for my family and my children. It’s so grotesque.'

The couple also faced criticism last August when they were accused of trying to avoid paying the country’s high taxes.

Mr
Kinnock, a director of the World Economic Fund, pays income tax on his 
£110,000 salary in Switzerland, where tax rates are much lower than in 
Denmark.
