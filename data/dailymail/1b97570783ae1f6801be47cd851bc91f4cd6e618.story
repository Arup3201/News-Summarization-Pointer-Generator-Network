Stepping in:Chancellor Merkel has assured Jewish and Muslim leader they will be able to carry our circumcisions on young boys

Germany's Chancelleor Merkel has promised Jewish and Muslim communities that they will be free to carry out circumcision on young boys despite a court ban.

Last month a judge in Cologne sparked fury among religious groups by outlawing the practice on the grounds that it causes 'illegal bodily harm'.

The ban provoked a rare show of unity between Jews, Muslims and Christians who see it as a threat to religious freedom.

In a country that is especially 
sensitive to allegations of intolerance because of the Nazis' slaughter 
of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, the government said it would find a 
way around the Cologne court ban in June as a matter of urgency.

European rabbis descended on Berlin this 
week to lobby against what they see as an affront to religious freedom -
 with the backing of Muslim and Christian leaders in an unusual show of 
unity, as well as the support of many German politicians.

A spokesman for the chancellor said: 
'For everyone in the government it is absolutely clear that we want to 
have Jewish and Muslim religious life in Germany.

'Circumcision carried out in a responsible manner must be possible in this country without punishment.'

Ruling in the case of a Muslim boy 
taken to a doctor with bleeding after circumcision, the Cologne court 
said the practice inflicts bodily harm and should not be carried out on 
young boys, but could be practiced on older males who give consent.

This is not acceptable under Jewish 
religious practice which requires boys to be circumcised from eight days
 old, nor for many Muslims, for whom the age of circumcision varies 
according to family, country and branch of Islam.

'It is well know that in the Jewish 
religion early circumcision carries great meaning, so it is a matter of 
urgency that this right be restored,' said Seibert, adding that Merkel's
 own office would be involved in efforts to resolve the problem.

'We know a quick decision is needed 
and that this cannot be put off. Freedom of religious practice is a very
 important legal right for us,' he said.

Germany is a close ally of Israel and 
its ambassador there has promised parliament's Diaspora Affairs 
Committee to defend the rights of Germany's growing Jewish community.

European rabbis ended their meeting in
 Berlin on Thursday in a defiant mood. They plan talks with German 
Muslim and Christian leaders in Stuttgart next week to see how they can 
fight the ban together.

The ruling by the Cologne Regional 
Court applies to the city and surrounding districts with a total 
population of just over 2 million people. The total population of 
Germany is about 82 million. Cologne is home to about 120,000 Muslims, 
whose plans for a new central mosque has stirred anti-immigrant 
sentiment.

The head of the Conference of European Rabbis urged Jews in Germany to continue carrying out circumcision despite the ban.

But the German Medical Association, 
while opposing the ban because it could drive circumcision underground 
with greater risk of infection through poor hygiene, advised doctors not
 to carry out the operation until the legal situation is cleared up as 
they could risk prosecution.

Pinchas Goldschmidt, the Swiss-born 
chief rabbi of Moscow who organized the meeting, said the ban was a 
fresh example of creeping prejudice in European law against 
non-Christians, after a Swiss ban on minarets, French and Belgian bans 
on Islamic veils in public and an attempted Dutch ban on halal meat.

'Circumcision represents the basis for
 belonging to the Jewish community. It has been practiced for 4,000 
years and cannot be changed,' said Goldschmidt.

Germany is home to about 120,000 Jews 
and 4 million Muslims. Many of the latter originating from Turkey, which
 has also condemned last month's court ruling.
