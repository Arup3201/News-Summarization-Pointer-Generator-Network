The Wu-Tang Clan has distanced themselves from a troubled rapper who cut off his own penis before trying to commit suicide.

Andre Johnson, who has performed with the
 Wu-Tang Clan and produced music with members, was rushed to hospital on Wednesday after he jumped from a second-floor balcony at an apartment building 
in North Hollywood. He is in a stable condition in hospital but his severed penis was unable to be reattached, TMZ reported.

In a blog post, which was later deleted from the official Wu-Tang Clan website, the rap collective put a picture of Mr Johnson with the headline 'Exclusive: Not affiliated to the Wutang brand'.

Beneath the picture of Mr Johnson, in the
 middle of a red-ringed prohibited sign, a message reads: 'Parental 
Advisory: Donâ€™t Believe The HYPE. This m*********** Ainâ€™t Got s*** to do
 with The WUTANG Brand'.

The blog post has been taken down from the rap collective's website but can still be found in Google's web cache.

In response to MailOnline's email sent to the official press contact, a Wu-Tang Clan source responded today: 'While we wish the guy good luck and hope this is not a mental health problem of some sort, We hope he gets help as this is not regular behavior.

'If this behavior is attributed to drugs of such we hope he gets help in this as well. However none of this is Of Tribute to the Wutang clan movement, way of life or legacy.'

Rapper friends told TMZ on
 Tuesday that, without warning, Mr Johnson cut his penis off and jumped 
from the second floor. The incident happened so quickly, that by the 
time friends made it to the ground floor, Mr Johnson was on his feet and
 'running around screaming', the site reported.

No hard drugs were reportedly involved but the rapper is believed to have mental health issues.

Johnson is a rapper who goes by the 
name Christ Bearer in the group Northstar. The act was  discovered by 
Wu-Tang producer and rapper RZA in 1998. He produced their 2004 debut 
album RZA Presents Northstar.

An
 LAPD spokesman told MailOnline on Wednesday that an individual was 
taken by ambulance to a local area hospital following an incident 
shortly before 1am this morning at the 4500 block of Colfax Avenue in 
North Hollywood.
