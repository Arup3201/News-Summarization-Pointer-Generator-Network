The fictional serial killer Dexter has claimed yet another victim - this time in New York City's busiest transportation hub. 

The wife of an African diplomat has filed a lawsuit claiming that she was injured when she was startled by an advertisement for the hit Showtime drama starring Michael C. Hall at Grand Central Terminal.

The oversize ad for the show, which finished its eight-season run last year, was spread across the risers of steps leading up to the bustling terminal, said attorney Rehan Nazrali who represents the plaintiff, Ajanaffy Njewadda.

Silent 'killer': A woman has filed a lawsuit claiming this oversize poster advertising the Showtime drama Dexter at Grand Central Terminal startled her and made her fall down the stairs

The 
lawsuit, filed last week in Bronx Supreme Court, says the placement of 
the ad was hazardous and caused her to fall last June.

The
 gigantic poster featured a closeup Michael C. Hall wrapped in 
cellophane. He portrayed a blood spatter pattern analyst moonlighting as
 a serial killer known for encasing his victims in plastic wrap.

In
 a phone interview with MailOnline Thursday, Mr Nazrali asserted that 
the striking image of the fictional serial killer had no place on a
 staircase inside a busy train station. 

‘It
 is designed to be eye-popping, arresting and disturbing,’ he said. ‘The
 neurological response you would get from this is shock.’

He added, ‘You do not went to shock people where they’re going up and down the stairs.’

On June 20,
 2013, Mrs Njewadda was walking down the staircase, a vantage point from
 which the ad was not visible, but stopped and turned around midway to 
look for her elderly husband, a former ambassador from Gambia, the 
lawyer said.

'It's a big
 face wrapped in cellophane, said Nazrali. 'It scares her.... That 
little shock was enough of a trigger to throw her off balance.'

Banged up: Ajanaffy Njewadda took a spill, fracturing her right foot, spraining her right ankle and hitting her head, according to her lawyer

Njewadda tumbled down the stairs, fracturing her right foot, spraining her right ankle and hitting her head, he said.

The lawyer added that the ambassador’s 
wife also had to seek psychological help because she was suffering from 
nightmares after her too-close encounter with Dexter. 

Disturbed: Njewadda, the wife of a former ambassador from Gambia, also allegedly had to seek psycological  help because she was suffering from nightmares after the fall

‘As far as she’s concerned, there is still residual  trauma,’ said Nazrali.

Speaking to MailOnline, the attorney added that his client had never watched the popular Showtime series.

Njewadda stayed away from the ill-fated stairway for several months after the fall. She eventually returned to the station, but her lawyer said the woman is still fearful.  

Named in the lawsuit were Showtime, the New York City Transit Authority, CBS Outdoor Americas which contracted to place the ad, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New York City.

Mr Nazrani hopes to use this case to start a conversation about the aggressive over-commercialization of public space, and the fact that using 'shockvertisements' like the Dexter ad it is not always ‘harm-free.’  

'I think they should realize that they’re trying to elicit a psychological response from the viewer,' he said. 'They want something kinetic. There’s nothing wrong in doing that, but you don’t want to destroy people.’ 

The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, but the lawyer said his client wants a ‘fair deal.’

Speaking to DNAInfo.com, Nazrani revealed that he had tried to reach an agreement directly with Showtime, but an attorney for the network responded that there was nothing wrong with the ad because New Yorker do not scare easily.

A spokeswoman at the MTA said it does not comment on pending litigation.
