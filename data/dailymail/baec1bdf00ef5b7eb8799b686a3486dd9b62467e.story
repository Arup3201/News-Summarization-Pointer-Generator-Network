A young US State Department spokeswoman is responding to Monday night's self-set media fire by adding more fuel, insisting she wasn't wrong to say the Obama administration should help jihadis from the 'Islamic State' find jobs as a way to stop them from engaging in bloody terrorism.

'In the longer term – and this isn't specific to ISIL,' Marie Harf said Wednesday morning on MSNBC, 'military commanders, politicians of both parties, counter-terrorism experts all agree that if you're going to prevent terrorist groups from spreading to other places and getting more recruits, you have to look at the root causes that can lead people to extremism.'

'How do you get them to not pick up that AK-47?' she mused.

'You have to do all of it, you have to take them on militarily,' Harf allowed, 'but you have to look at things like governance, like opportunity, so these groups aren't able to get more people to their cause.'

On Tuesday night she told a CNN audience that 'we cannot kill every terrorist around the world, nor should we try. How do you get at the root causes of this? It might be too nuanced an argument for some.'

UNDER THE BUS: President Obama hinted Wednesday that Harf is all wet, saying 'poverty alone doesn't cause somebody to become a terrorist, any more than poverty causes someone to become a criminal'

Hatrf's astonishing double-down came after a Monday night turn on MSNBC in which she said the United States 'cannot win this war by killing them, we cannot kill our way out of this war.'

Instead, she said, the administration should 'go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups' – including 'lack of opportunity for jobs.'

On Fox News, Bush-era White House press secretary Dana Perino said Harf should stop talking.  

'If a deputy spokesperson for the Department of State is the lead story for three days straight ... if the spokesman is the story, you've got the formula wrong,' Perino said during an afternoon broadcast. 

President Barack Obama seemed to undermine Harf's argument Wednesday afternoon, telling the White House's 'Countering Violent Extremism' conference that 'poverty alone doesn't cause somebody to become a terrorist, any more than poverty causes someone to become a criminal.'

'There are terrorists who come from extraordinarily wealthy backgrounds,' Obama said, 'like Osama bin Laden.'

Harf's series of embarrassing gaffes is reinforcing charges from Republicans that the White House for papering over religious aspects of a mass-beheading of Coptic Christians by the ISIS terror army.

JOBLESS JIHAD: Harf had insisted Monday night that a jobs program in the Middle East could stem the tide of ISIS

'THEY WERE CHRISTIANS': Pope Francis mourned the loss of 21 Copts in Libya who were beheaded on video by ISIS terrorists

Video surfaced on Sunday showing Libyan ISIS sympathizers decapitating 21 Christians on a beach. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest issued a 192-word reaction condemning the brutal killings as 'despicable' and 'cowardly' but made no mention of the religion of the killers or their victims.

The words 'Christian,' 'Islam' and 'Muslim.' were not included in Earnest's statement.

The video itself was titled 'A Message Signed With Blood to the Nation of the Cross.' The slaughtered men, clad in orange jumpsuits reminiscent of Guantanamo Bay detainee garb, were described as 'crusaders.'

One of the men was seen praying just moments before his throat was slit.

The White House convened a conference with representatives from more than 60 countries on Tuesday on a subject it calls 'countering violent extremism.' 

Like Earnest's statement, administration officials connected with the event have studiously avoided any mention of radical Islam or its animosity toward Christians and Jews.

'We are not treating these people as part of a religion,' a senior administration official said Monday during a conference call with reporters.

'We're treating them as terrorists. We call them our enemies and we’ll be treating them as such.'

World leaders outside of Washington have leapt to connect ISIS, the self-described Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, with a religious battle that pits Islamists against the world's other great religions.

The 21 Copts, 'were killed simply for the fact that they were Christians,' Pope Francis said Monday at the Vatican, speaking in his native Spanish.

MUSLIM VS. CHRISTIAN: The five-minute ISIS video released on Sunday was captioned: 'The people of the cross, followers of the hostile Egyptian church'; One of the terrorists (center) boasted that 'safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for'

IMPATIENCE IN CONGRESS: Republicans including New York Rep. Peter King are growing more frustrated with a White House that steadfastly refuses to frame the ISIS battle in religious terms

'The blood of our Christian brothers and sisters is a testimony which cries out to be heard. It makes no difference whether they be Catholics, Orthodox, Copts or Protestants. They are Christians!'

British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was 'appalled by the murder of Christians in Libya, a simply barbaric and inhumane act.'

'Our efforts to defeat the monstrosity of Islamist extremism must not waver.'

A CNN/ORC poll found 57 per cent of Americans disapprove of how President Obama is handling the threat posed by ISIS. Even among Democrats, 46 per cent say America's battle with ISIS is going badly. 

Public approval of the administration's anti-ISIS efforts has slipped by 8 percentage points since September.

Part of that slide may be due to the State Department's focus on what conservatives deride as 'hashtag diplomacy' – a program of pushback through social media designed to strip away ISIS's glamorous appeal to would-be jihadis.

The New York Times reported Monday that State is engaged in a broad effort through its Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications to coordinate all the government's social media resources in response to nearly 100 Twitter accounts blasting pro-ISIS recruiting messages into the Internet's digital ether.

'We're getting beaten on volume, so the only way to compete is by aggregating, curating and amplifying existing content,' Under Secretary of State Richard Stengel told the Times.

'These guys aren't BuzzFeed,' Stengel said. 'They're not invincible in social media.'

But the director fo the National Counterterrorism Center told a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last week that 'the government is probably not the best platform to try to communicate with the set of actors who are potentially vulnerable to this kind of propaganda and this kind of recruitment.'

'We try to find ways to stimulate this kind of counternarrative, this kind of countermessaging, without having a U.S. government hand in it.'
