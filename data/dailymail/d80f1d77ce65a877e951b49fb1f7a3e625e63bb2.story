A make-up artist fears a mystery illness which has caused her to double in size in just six months will soon leave her unable to move. 

Laura Pell, 34, weighed 9st (126lb/57kg) last summer and kept herself in shape by going to gym three times a week and eating a sensible diet.

But after being struck down with a mystery illness which has baffled doctors, she began to retain fluid which has caused her body to swell in size.

She now weighs 17 stone (238lb/108kg) and describes her life as 'hell'. 

On average, she is gaining an average of one-a-half-stone every month and has gone from a slender size 10 to size 22.

Fluid retention has caused the 34-year-old to nearly double in size - from a size 8 to 22 - in just six months 

Miss Pell, who lives  in Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, has also been forced to buy a completely new set of clothes.

She has also been forced to give up her job as a wedding make-up artist because she struggles to walk and fears she she will soon be unable to move if a cure is not found.

She said: 'I am in absolute agony and I am struggling to move. The last six months have been hell, and I just have no quality of life.

'When you're fat you're supposed to be flabby and wobbly, but my skin is just completely taut and tight.

'I know that some people who look at me in the street must be thinking I've just let myself go and eat too much, but I actually less than I did before I had this condition.

'I joke to my boyfriend Mark that I'm like Violet from Willy Wonka when she turns into a blueberry - I need to be sent to the juicing room.

'I'm a bit like a human waterbed, I'm just so full of liquid, you can see it in my skin.' 

On average, she is gaining an average of one-a-half-stone every month and says her confidence is shattered

The mysterious health problem has led to  rapid fluid retention, high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat.

Despite several weeks of hospital treatment and taking medication to ease the fluid retention, Miss Pell’s condition has not improved, the Northampton Chronicle reports.

After exhausting all treatment routes available on the NHS, she is now raising money for a private medical appointment to see a specialist who may be able to diagnose the cause of the problem.

Miss Pell's new appearance has also severely damaged her confidence. As a result, she barely leaves the house and also finds travelling painful.

'My heart rate goes up to about 180 beats per minute whenever I try to do any form of exercise,' she said.

Miss Pell, who does not have any children, has suffered from Primary Immune Deficiency for years and needs regular injections to replenish plasma levels in her blood.

The condition has caused her to suffered from a number of health problems, including meningitis, tuberculosis, pneumonia and Clostridium Difficile.

Last August, doctors discovered a benign tumour on her pituitary gland but this was dismissed as a cause to her rapid fluid retention.

She was prescribed powerful diuretics and steroids in an attempt to drain the excess fluid from her body but all treatments have so far failed.

She is now planning to see an neurologist and an endocrinologist at a private clinic in Manchester in a desperate bid to find a cure.

'I have had so many doctors tell me I am a "complicated case", but I know that already. 

'I want someone who knows how to sort this out.

'My boyfriend and my mum are basically my carers now. I'm 34 years old, but I feel like I'm 90.

'I don't fit into any of my old clothes and it's costing a fortune to buy new ones.' 

She said: 'I'm a bit like a human waterbed, I'm just so full of liquid, you can see it in my skin'

Doctors are baffled as to why she is retaining so much fluid, describing her as a 'complicated case'

'I have two Jack Russell dogs called Sam and Millie and they are often the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning, but I can't even walk them so Mark has to do that.

'I have been with Mark about 18 months but he has stuck by me through all this. I am very lucky he is with me because he loves me, not for how I look.

'When I catch a glimpse of myself in the reflection of a window or mirror I don't recognise myself.'

Her friends have also rallied round and set up a Facebook group called 'Laura Needs Our Help' which already has hundreds of supporters from around the world.

Miss Pell said: 'I'm used to being ill because of my immune problems, but this has been so tough.'

'It was really embarrassing the last time I went for an MRI scan because the machine is quite small and they were afraid that if I went in I would get stuck.

'I had to have an alternative CT scan instead.

'No one seems to have any idea what is causing this and I'm genuinely scared I'll soon end up too large to walk.'
