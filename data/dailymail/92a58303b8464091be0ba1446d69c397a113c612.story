Hate preacher Abu Hamza is ill because he can’t get enough sleep in his ‘harsh’ prison cell, his lawyers complained yesterday.

They want judges to halt his extradition to the US so he can have an MRI scan to establish if he is fit to travel.

It is the latest legal delaying tactic in a case which has already taken eight years and cost the British taxpayer more than £1million.

'Deteriorating health': Abu Hamza asked the High Court to grant him time for an MRI scan as he renewed a long-running legal battle to halt his extradition from the UK to the US

If the High Court rejects the appeal, 
the hook-handed Islamist fanatic could finally be on a plane to America –
where he is wanted for running a terrorist training camp – by the 
middle of the month.

Hamza’s previous argument that it 
would be a breach of his human rights to imprison him for decades in a 
US jail was rejected by judges in Strasbourg last week.

Now he has changed tactics by saying 
he has ‘deteriorating health’ and it would be ‘oppressive’ to kick him 
out in his condition. In papers before two judges in London, Hamza’s QC,
Alun Jones, argues there is ‘medical opinion that a [MRI] scan is 
medically necessary’.

The QC says a judge referred to Hamza’s ‘very poor health’ at an extradition hearing in 2008.

The papers continue: ‘Over four years 
later, it appears there has been, or may have been, a further 
deterioration, perhaps attributable to sleep deprivation and the 
continued confinement of the appellant in an unrelentingly harsh 
environment.’

The QC said Home Secretary Theresa May
had been asked in August for a scan to take place in jail, but the 
request had been ‘ignored’.

Hamza lost his arms and one eye on what he claims was a de-mining mission in Afghanistan. 

An MRI scan can determine if a patient has musculoskeletal or bone problems.

Mr Jones admits in his written 
submissions that, after further medical tests are carried out and 
considered by doctors on both sides, ‘there may be no issue’.

But he insisted that at present ‘it 
cannot possibly be said there is no issue’. He is expected to make more 
submissions on Hamza’s behalf today, before judges reach a verdict on 
whether to grant an injunction, delaying his removal.

The judges are also considering 
challenges by Babar Ahmad, Syed Ahsan, Khaled Al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul 
Bary, all of whom are wanted by the US authorities on terrorism charges.

None of the men was in court 
yesterday. Hamza was recently moved from Belmarsh jail, in South London,
to Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, where the others are held. It has 
fuelled speculation they could be transported to the US together once 
their appeals are exhausted. Hamza, who was jailed for seven years for 
soliciting to murder and inciting racial hatred, has been fighting 
extradition since 2004.

He has been charged with 11 counts of 
criminal conduct related to the taking of 16 hostages in Yemen in 1998, 
advocating violent jihad in Afghanistan in 2001, and conspiring to 
establish a jihad training camp in Oregon between June 2000 and December
2001.

Plea: Home Secretary Theresa May has been invited to reconsider Al-Fawwaz's case who faces more than 269 counts of murder - according to his QC Edward Fitzgerald

James Eadie QC, appearing for the Home
Secretary, argued that all the applications before the court had been 
brought too late and had no merit.

He said the latest legal points could 
have been argued at earlier hearings months or years ago, and that they 
had been ‘stored up’ to cause unnecessary delay and amounted to an abuse
of process.

Mr Eadie told the judges: ‘There must be finality in litigation.’

The judges made it clear they want the case decided quickly. They intend to give an ‘indication’ of the outcome today.
