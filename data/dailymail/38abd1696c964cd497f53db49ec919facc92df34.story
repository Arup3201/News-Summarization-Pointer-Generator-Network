The body of a Texas mother-of-two, who has been missing for more than a week, was found on Sunday evening after her estranged boyfriend confessed that he killed her and dumped her body.

Michelle Warner, 31, was last seen on September 21 after she reportedly got into an intense argument with her ex-boyfriend Mark Castellano, 37.

Castellano initially denied he was responsible for her death.

Last seen: Warner left Castellanos' apartment at Regency Square Apartment Homes on Bellerive Drive after a fight during which Castellano allegedly threw a pet cat against the wall

But on Sunday, police reportedly spent hours interviewing Castellano, who told officers that he killed Miss Warner.

KTRK reported that Castellano also told investigators the location of her body, which was later found in Odessa.

Castellano has now been charged with murder, according to the station.

Friends and family said Miss Warner, 31, was last seen at the Regency Square Apartment Complex, where she lived with Castellano and their three-year-old son, Cayden.

People close to Miss Warner described her as very bubbly and talkative, and said that she would have never severed communication with friends or taken off without her son.

New beginning: Warner was excited to start a job as a paralegal after spending the last 18 months unemployed  

Family: Warner has a three-year-old son, Cayden, left, with Mark Castellano, and an 11-year-old daughter from a previous relationship

Miss Warner, who also has an 
11-year-old daughter who lives with her father, was about to start a new
job as a paralegal and was excited about working again after spending 
the last 18 months unemployed, Click2Houston reported.

Her family said Warner moved in with Castellano for financial reasons, but the two were not currently dating.

Longtime friend Stephanie Helton, who has been friends with Warner since grade school, told ABC that the relationship between Warner and Castellano has 'never been a good situation.'

Ms Helton said the two met when all three of them were working for a home health care provider.

In 2008, Warner became pregnant with Cayden, but the relationship with the father of her child was not going well because Castellano had 'psychotic spells.'

'He had episodes, he tried suicide ...,' she told ABC. 'He's done other crazy things. Nothing extra-violent; he's push[ed] her up against the wall, that type of thing. He's threatened her.'

Distance: Miss Warner was last seen in Houston on September 21, but her body was found nine days later in Odessa - about 500 miles away

Concerned loved ones: Warner's friends Stefanie Helton, right, and Scott Russell, left, said that it is not like the bubbly, talkative mother of two to disappear for several days without telling anyone

Ms Helton said that according to her 
friend's family member, at around 7pm last Saturday, Castellano and 
Warner got into a fight, during which the man threw their pet cat 
against a wall.

The mother of two got upset and hit him before storming out of the apartment on Bellerive Drive.

According to the woman's brother, fresh bleach stains were found on the carpet inside the unit leading from the bedroom through the living room and out the front door.

The night of her disappearance, Warner went to dinner with a friend, Scott Russell. He dropped her off at the apartment complex afterward and left. She had not been seen since.
