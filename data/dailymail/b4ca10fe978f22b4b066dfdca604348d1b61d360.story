More than 100 people have made donations in the last three days to cover the funeral expenses of a mother and daughter killed in a Florida crime spree Thursday.

More than $4,000 has been raised on a GoFundMe account for the family of Patricia Moran, 72, and her 51-year-old daughter, Deborah Royal, who were killed in their Haines City home Thursday. 

Rachel Dominguez, of Lakeland, created the account Friday, just one day after police found Moran and Royal dead in their home. The account has since seen 108 donors.

Dominguez states on the page that the account was sparked by her friendship with Royal's daughter, Tiffany Royal. 

'Tiffany and (sic) here family now have the horrible and daunting task of putting her mother and grandmother to rest. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated,' Dominguez wrote. 

Moran and Royal were victims of a break-in that began when four suspects allegedly attempted to elude police after robbing an Auburndale pawn shop at gun point.

Viciously: An official said the mother and daughter were 'viciously murdered' in a manner 'much too graphic to describe'

Grady Judd, Polk County sheriff, did not give details of how the women were killed in a news conference, but said they were 'viciously murdered' in a manner 'much too graphic to describe,' according to ABC News.   

The accused murderer, 34-year-old Michael Gordon, allegedly killed the two before stealing their vehicle in an effort to elude police who had the house surrounded.
