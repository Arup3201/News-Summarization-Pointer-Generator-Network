Cameron ally: Nick Boles warned that Conservatives have no appeal to the under 25s

Tory right-wingers denounced Cameron ally Nick Boles as an ‘alien’ yesterday after the planning minister said the party was out of touch with young people.

In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Boles warned that Conservatives have no appeal to the under 25s because they view the Tories as ‘aliens from another planet’.

He called for Mr Cameron to shout his support for gay marriage ‘from the rooftops’ and back the creation of a National Liberal party to attract young voters and those outside the rural heartlands of the South East, with Tory MPs running on a joint ticket at the next election.

No 10 rejected Mr Boles’ plan. 

But right-wingers went further yesterday denouncing Mr Boles’ proposals, saying they would alienate voters further and called for a more robust Conservative message.

Leading Tory traditionalist Stewart Jackson, the MP for Peterborough, said: ‘I see Tory modernisers as an alien tribe. 

‘I simply wouldn’t even contemplate voting for them.’ Mr Jackson pointed to the decisive victory of right-winger Tony Abbott in the recent Australian general election.

‘Tony Abbott shows where you’ve [got] principled, strong, Conservative leadership [and] vision even against an endemic liberal Establishment, you’ll win.’ 

Fellow backbencher Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, accused Mr Boles of peddling the kind of trendy views prevalent in the Westminster village, rather than seeking to win over voters elsewhere.

He called on the Prime Minister to give local people a stronger say in candidate selection by opening up the vote to local people in open primaries and consulting constituents using the internet.

Mr Carswell said: ‘Real Tory modernisation means open primary selection and an iDemocracy structure, not following latest faddish thoughts of [the] SW1 gang.’ 

Mr Boles is a member of Mr Cameron’s inner social circle and his views are listened to by senior ministers.

His speech, to the Bright Blue think tank, was significant since it amounted to an admission that Mr Cameron’s modernising project to make the Tories more attractive has failed after eight years.

Mr Boles did win unlikely support from some Conservative right-wingers though, who are attracted by the idea of Conservative MPs being allowed to run on joint tickets with the UK Independence Party.

Peter Bones, the MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘There are a number of people in the party who are attracted by these ideas since they want to fight the next election with the support of other parties.

‘A second party should be able to endorse Conservate candidates. Nick Boles seems to want to run as a Conservative and a National Liberal. I would like to run as a Conservative backed by Ukip.

‘I think there is much merit in this argument but I don’t think that is quite what Nick Boles had in mind. We used to run as Conservatives and Unionists, so this isn’t anything unusual.’ 

But Mr Bone, a committed Eurosceptic who also opposed gay marriage, dismissed Mr Boles’ claims that his views would repel young voters.

‘My views are just as attractive to young people as they are to anyone else,’ he said.
