Only in Australia! A hilarious video of a policeman joining in with a street cricket match during Australia Day celebrations has gone viral internationally.

In a quintessentially Aussie scene, the uniformed policeman enthusiastically smashes the ball all over the street whilst onlookers cheer him on.

Rhett Lee, owner of Body Revival Personal Fitness Solutions (and with a name suitably similar to that of Australian cricket legend Brett Lee) posted the video and has already received around a million views. 

Lee and his flatmate Joshua Tootell, both 26, were hosting a beach-side Australia Day BBQ - cooking snags, listening to Triple J’s Hottest 100 and playing barefoot cricket on the road in the NSW town of Wollongong, south of Sydney.

On Tuesday, they were reacquainted with their new mate and the star of the hysterical video: Constable Adam David, posing for a photo together with huge grins as they marvelled at their overnight fame.

The street, Cliff Road, had been shut down for Australia Day Wollongong City Council festivities.

When a patrol car stopped at the end of the street, they were certain their game was about to be shut down by an officer.

‘He sat for a while in the car watching while we played. We thought he was watching us to try and shut the game down,’ explains Mr Tootell.

‘We had the speakers on the road for the countdown, we had all our beers with us,’ said guest, Lloyd van Gogh, who explains that his day started with a swim and some beers from breakfast.

‘We thought we were getting in trouble. 

'A cop had come through earlier and told us you can’t have beers, but we just hid them and they came back out soon after.'

Those present were all stunned when a smiling policeman exited the car with his hand extended, asking if he could join in and have a bowl.

The policeman didn’t hold back, bowling fast and furiously to the delight of onlookers.

‘He bowled someone out, he had good form!’ said Mr Lee.

‘Everyone had their cameras out. He said “I hope this doesn’t end up on the Internet!” and we said “oh yeah, sure,”’ laughed Mr Tootell.

The footage of the policeman’s excellent innings was indeed posted on the internet and has now being an Internet sensation.

It was soon the policeman’s turn to show off his batting prowess.

‘We put him in to bat and he ended up smashing three good balls,’ explained Mr Lee.

‘He had good technique with the bat, I’d say he must play on weekends,’ said Mr van Gogh.

However, the policeman inadvertently did shut down the cricket match when he sent the ball sailing over the fence.

The crowd cheers as the policeman hits the ball for six - until they realise the ball has been lost for good

The three men all agree that it was wonderful to see a policemen get into the spirit of Australia Day and enjoy himself with the community

‘He hit a six -so he was six and out. But he actually hit the ball over the fence and we couldn’t get it back, so that was the end of the game,’ said Mr van Gogh good naturedly.

‘But the police officer was a full time legend! Such a good bloke,’ said Mr van Gogh.

‘He was high-fiving people as he walked back to his car.’

After he lost the cricket ball, the policeman made a quick departure.

‘He said, “okay, time to move on, catch you guys later,”’ said Mr Lee.

‘He was having a ball, everyone was excited because he interacted and had a lot of fun.’

The three men all agree that it was wonderful to see a policemen get into the spirit of Australia Day and enjoy himself with the community.

‘He was just showing us that we’re all human. It was Australia Day so he was letting his hair down on a day you’re meant to enjoy yourself with everyone,’ said Mr van Gogh.

‘I've always had a good opinion of police. It’s a tough job but they keep our streets clean and safe,’ he added.

‘I have lived in Wollongong for eight years and I have never, ever felt unsafe, even if I’m walking home late at night.’

‘I have a really good opinion of police.’

Mr Lee also says that the police officers interaction with the South Coast community is a wonderful quality.

‘It’s great here on the South Coast. Most of the police officers are very down to earth.

‘It’s really nice that even if they’re trying to shoo you along they will always be really happy and cheerful .There’s that South Coast vibe to it all and people really enjoy the interaction!’

As far as they know, everyone was well-behaved on Australia Day with a family-oriented feel on the streets of Wollongong.
