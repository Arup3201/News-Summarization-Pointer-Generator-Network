A man who found a travel partner after raffling his ex-fiancee's honeymoon place has returned from an 'amazing holiday' - but claims there was no romance.

John Whitbread, 32, - who became known as Jilted John - advertised on eBay after his girlfriend told him at Christmas she did not want to get married.

Desperate to find a holiday partner for the £1,950 trip to the Dominican Republic, John, from Donisthorpe, Leicestershire, tried to find a companion for the trip on eBay.

The pair were united on live television just under two hours before they will board the flight to the Dominican Republic

John Whitbread went in for a hug as he met raffle winner Kelly for the first time at the airport this morning

But he was left frustrated after the two highest bidders both failed in turnup to pay the winning sum for the holiday - which included all-inclusive accommodation at a four-star luxury resort.

Finally, after instead selling £10 raffle tickets - raising £1,410 for testicular cancer charity Balls To Cancer he jetted off to the Caribbean with lucky winner Kelly Wood - who he met for the first time at the airport.

John said he is constantly asked if they have become a couple. But he said this could not have been further from his mind.

He said : 'Everyone is hoping I've found romance again. Obviously not. I only recently split up with my girlfriend.'

He added: 'I have made a friend out of it and it's brilliant. It could have easily gone the other way.

'To go on holiday with a complete stranger and get on is incredible.

 The pair admitted they were both feeling the nerves, as Miss Wood told Good Morning Britain her hands were shaking and Mr Whitbread said he didn't know what to do with himself

'Hopefully we will stay friends. I don't see why not.'

Ms Wood, an attractive blonde, wrote on Facebook: 'We are having a fantastic time and getting on like a house on fire as they say!'

She later added: 'Such great memories to take away with me though and an amazing new friend for life!!

John Whitbread was dumped by his ex-fiancee Amy just weeks before their Valentine's Day wedding

'Loved every second of this crazy adventure!! Couldn't have asked for more!!' 

Mr Whitbread was left heartbroken after his ex-fiancée Amy told him she wasn't 'ready to get married' and left him with a spare ticket to the Dominican Republic.

Instead of cancelling the trip, Mr Whitbread decided to give the opportunity to a stranger to join him by auctioning off the £1,950 ticket, with offers starting at 99p.

But when the two highest bidders - who offered £8,000 and £7,900 - failed to pay up he decided to raffle off the tickets for £10 instead.

He was united with raffle winner Kelly Wood for the first time on ITV just under two hours before he was due to board the plane at Manchester airport for the two-week all inclusive break.

The advert said his desired companion must be an 'easy going down to earth' woman, a British citizen with a passport and 'good looking wouldn't go amiss'.

Arriving at the airport with his parents, Mr Whitbread waited anxiously to see if the woman would arrive.

He said: 'I feel nervous. I don't know what to do with myself. I know her name is Kelly and what she looks like but I'm trying to save it all for the plane.'

Mr Whitbread was undecided on how he would greet her and was debating whether to give her a hug, a kiss - or 'a high five' and added 'I'll see what comes naturally'.

When they were finally introduced by a television crew they gave each other a hug.

Instead of cancelling the honeymoon he decided to auction off the tickets to a stranger who might like to join him. The two highest eBay bidders failed to pay up, so he decided to sell raffle tickets instead

Miss Wood, who had set up her own Facebook campaign called 'Take Kelly Wood' said: 'I'm nervous - my hands have just started to shake. I feel like a swan, quite calm on the front but underneath I'm paddling away.'

A television crew from Good Morning Britain, which filmed the moment they first met, asked the pair a few 'Mr & Mrs' style questions before they boarded the plane.

Asked who would get the window seat Miss Wood offered it up to Mr Whitbread and whether they were thrill seekers or beach babes they agreed they were a bit of both.

Miss Wood also revealed that she 'sleeps in the middle of the bed' and the worst habit Mr Whitbread could have would be snoring, which he previously revealed he did.

His new companion was then introduced to Mr Whitbread's parents, who embraced her and their son.

The pair flew to the Caribbean region, where they stayed in the honeymoon suite in single beds, and returned on March 3.

This is the moment the pair first met live on breakfast television this morning. Before then all they knew were each others names and what they looked like. Mr Whitbread said he wanted to save chatting for the plane

Explaining his decision to sell off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said: 'I was gutted when she said she didn't want to get married but I realised I couldn't mope forever and I didn't want what I'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste.

'Besides, I think it will be good for me to get away. I'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun.'

He claims his girlfriend of two years, Amy, told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on Valentine's Day this year. 

But when he tried to cancel their holiday the Co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him.

With the help of his best friend Craig Gibson, he set up an eBay auction to find someone to travel with him.

Mr Whitbread, who described himself as a slim, 5ft 9in, with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh, wrote on the advert: 'I'm not boring, I'm adventurous otherwise I wouldn't be doing something as ridiculous as this'.

The pair stayed for two weeks at the honeymoon suite at the Blue Bay Villas Hotel in the Dominican Republic 

Kelly Wood had campaigned to win the ticket and was introduced to her holiday partner for the first time at the airport. Miss Wood compared herself to feeling like a swan - fine on the surface but paddling underneath

Although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry on Valentine's Day, Mr Whitbread says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee.

Speaking after the split, he said: 'I'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - I suppose I've got to respect her honesty.

'But I'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by.

'When I found out at the travel agent I could only get half my money back I was looking at other deals and places I could go but I thought, 'No, I wanted to go on this holiday'.

'I called my best friend and he agreed so I headed straight to his house to make the ebay page.

'Everyone I know is taken and I'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that I'd never otherwise get to meet.

Mr Whitbread admitted he could only get half his money back from the travel agent and decided he wanted to go on this holiday but would like some female company

A friend help him set up an advert where he asked for an 'easy going down to earth' woman, a British citizen with a passport and 'good looking wouldn't go amiss'

'I'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before.

'I'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday. If the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too.' 

After being overwhelmed with the response, Mr Whitbread pledged to donate any money over £1,050 to testicular cancer research.

He added: 'People have said I've got real balls to do this so I thought I might as well try and make some money for charity if I can to.'

Kelly Wood set up her own Facebook page to get people to buy tickets and donate to Mr Whitbread's cause and eventually won the seat herself. She posted this message this morning after keeping her win a secret

His ex-girlfriend Amy said: 'I just didn't feel ready to get married and John wasn't my soulmate. Obviously it's difficult for John, I'm finding it hard too.

'It's obviously not nice to finish with someone over Christmas but I thought it was better that he knew now, sooner rather than later.

'It was better that I called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it.

'Fair play to John. I'm pleased that he's doing something positive.'
