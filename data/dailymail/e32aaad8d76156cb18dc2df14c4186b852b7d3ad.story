Holes in the wall, rats living in the stove, blood stains on the walls and cigarette butts scattered in the bathtub.

This is the scene at a rental house in Queensland where two tenants have allegedly trashed the home and have now disappeared, leaving the landlord to clean up the $30,000 mess.

A Current Affair says Kerris and Nicole Rex have fled the home, leaving the landlord with the soiled premises, which he describes as the 'house of horrors.'

The search is now on for Australia's most wanted tenants, who haven't been seen or heard from in about a week.

The entire house is swamped with rubbish, with rats nesting in the stove

25 alcohol bottle were found in the kitchen by the landlord, some had been smashed in cupboards

Nicole's father Greg is also worried about his daughter saying he wanted to find Nicole, because he too, didn't know where they were.

'I really want to bring them back because I think she's in great danger of being hurt more than she has been hurt,' he told ACA.

He said before his daughter met Kerris 'she was a normal kid.'

When Nicole first moved in, the house was spotless according to the landlord, but it all started going downhill when Kerris moved in.

Now there's rubbish scattered in every room of the house, the kitchen is filled with alcohol bottles, there's broken windows and no working toilets of bathrooms.

According to the landlord he also found syringes and paraphernalia.

And it's believed the pair didn't just have a disregard and disrespect for the house they were living in but also their neighbours who claimed they were threatened and abused.

'He come running down the driveway with a steel hammer in his hand and grabbed me around the neck, twice, pushed me backwards,' neighbour Jane Brown told ACA.
