Pre-orders for Apple's new brightly-coloured iPhone 5C have not been 'overwhelming', according to a U.S network operator. 

The unnamed source told Reuters that supply for the plastic handset, as well as for the top-end iPhone 5S, has been disappointing, leading to suggestions Apple's bubble with consumers may have burst.

Both handsets are due to go on sale Friday and pre-orders opened last week. The handsets were announced in Cupertino on 10 September to a wave of criticism from industry experts claiming they were too expensive.

Apple's shares fell more than 5 per cent last week, following the announcement of the firm's' new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C.

The share price ended at a one-month low of $467.24 at midday after at least three brokerages downgraded the stock.

It is thought that investors were put off by the price of the handsets, especially the so-called 'cheap' iPhone 5C which starts at £469, claiming they weren't low enough for Apple to attract new customers, especially in emerging markets such as China.

At the event, Apple's CEO Tim Cook unveiled the two new models - the 5C and the more expensive 5S. 

He also announced the tech giant would be discontinuing the current iPhone 5 model.

The colourful 5C had been dubbed 'cut-price' before the event, with rumours suggesting it would be a departure from Apple's focus on purely premium phones.

However, with pricing for SIM-free versions of the device starting at £469, analysts predicted that Apple had made the 'wrong move' and the pricing was 'way off the mark.'

Apple began taking online orders for the iPhone 5C, which comes in blue, green, pink, yellow and white, on Friday.

The pricier 5S starts at £549 SIM-free in the UK and comes in grey, silver and gold.

Both phones go on sale in major territories including the U.S and UK on 20 September.

It will also be the first time an iPhone is sold in China from the day of launch, too.

As well as unveiling the new iPhone 5C and 5S at an event last week, Apple's CEO Tim Cook, pictured, announced the firm would be discontinuing the iPhone 5 in favour of its new iPhone 5S, pictured, and iPhone 5C. Experts believe this is a strategic shift for Apple to keep profits high

The level of inventory Apple has said it would provide for the 5S and 5C on launch day and in the week after launch is very disappointing, the source said, adding that supply of phones to all carriers appears to be limited.

Pre-orders are 'not overwhelming' either, the source continued, who refused to be identified because Apple had not disclosed the number of pre-orders for either of its two new smartphones.

Both models will be available through all major mobile network operators in the UK, including Vodafone, O2, Three, EE, Orange and T-Mobile.

Monthly prices vary depending on which operator the phone is bought from, whether the customer wants a 16GB or 32GB model and if they take out a 12-month or 24-month deal.
