An eight-year-old boy is today on a ventilator after a chlorine incident at a  swimming pool hospitalised 70 people and left one girl 'barking like a seal'.

Most were children and almost all were treated and released following the incident at a community pool in British Columbia, Canada, on Sunday.

But Billy Swyers and another adult were kept in. The boy was sitting on the bleachers when fumes were smelt in the air and everybody ran outside.

‘He's showing signs in his lungs that the doctors aren't happy with,’ the boy’s mother Angela Swyers said after the incident in Williams Lake.

‘So just as a precaution, they are keeping him overnight, giving him some antibiotics, and making sure he's OK before they send him home.’

Mrs Swyers said she was sitting on the seating with Billy when everyone ran out of the pool and many of the children were coughing heavily.

At the hospital, Billy was placed on a ventilator and given medication, she said, noting that doctors also performed blood work and an x-ray.

‘I just want to make sure he's better,’ Mrs Swyers said. ‘So we'll do whatever we can to get him healthy and then go home.’

The mother and son live in Quesnel, British Colombia, which sent several youngsters to the swim meet in Williams Lake, about 75 miles away.

Swimmers from Prince George were also there. A spokesman for Williams Lake described what happened as a ‘chlorine incident’.

Chlorine gas can be problematic because it dissolves into the moisture found in the upper and lower airways and forms an acidic compound that irritates the lung tissue and causes swelling

The irritation and swelling can give patients asthma and bronchitis-like symptoms, like wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath and sometimes chest pain

In some individuals, it can also result in bacterial pneumonia

He said authorities are trying to work out what happened at the Cariboo Memorial Recreation Complex, which also includes a hockey arena.

He said the pool uses chlorine gas, not liquid chlorine, which is dispensed by a computer. Chlorine is used to sanitise pool water.

But in high concentrations, particularly once airborne, the gas can turn toxic and cause a burning sensation in the eyes or breathing difficulties.

Kathie Kovacs, of Quesnel, wasn't at the event but drove to Williams Lake after learning her 12-year-old daughter, Janna, went to hospital.

‘When she coughs it sounds like almost like a seal barking,’ Mrs Kovacs said. ‘It's a really, deep horrible cough actually.’

Janna ran out of the pool after smelling what she thought was vomit. Some parents said a smaller, shallower pool there had been drained.

Janna and Billy were among dozens of children getting ready for the swim meet when one coach said she started smelling ‘something weird’.

'It was pretty scary seeing, like, eight-year-olds with oxygen masks on and stuff. It was scary'

‘People just said: “You've got to get out”,’ said coach Abbi Taylor, 17. She added that a ‘wall of people’ ran to the door when the alert was given.

The children, many still wearing wet bathing suits, were ushered to the ice arena before the whole building was evacuated and ambulances arrived.

‘It was pretty scary seeing, like, eight-year-olds with oxygen masks on and stuff,’ Ms Taylor said. ‘It was scary.’

Swimming pool staff trying to solve the problem were coughing and lifeguards were trying to keep people calm, Ms Taylor said.

Allison Ruault, health-services administrator for the region, said that 45 children and 25 adults were treated in total after the event.
