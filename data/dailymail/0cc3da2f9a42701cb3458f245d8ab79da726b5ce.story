A teenage sex slave of Colonel Gaddafi has told of the moment she was greeted by Tony Blair as he emerged from talks with the Libyan leader.

The 15-year-old was waiting outside a tent in Tripoli when the smiling former prime  minister is said to have emerged and said: ‘Hi girls.’

The schoolgirl said he was unaware that she and other members of Gaddafi’s personal harem would later be raped in the rooms where the summit had just taken place.

Shocking: Tony Blair is said to have emerged from the tent saying 'Hi Girls' to the sex slaves. He was unaware that they would late be raped in the same rooms the summits had been held

The moment is revealed in a new book that describes how the teenager was taken from her parents, groomed and forced to submit to the sexual demands of the Libyan dictator.

Identified only as Soraya, she tells how the wives of visiting dignitaries would also disappear into Gaddafi’s tent and emerge with their ‘lipstick smudged and their hair undone’.

But her biggest shock is reserved for seeing a ‘jaunty’ Mr Blair emerge from the tent. An extract of the book published in the New York Post says he was ‘clueless as to the atrocities under his nose’. 

The date of the meeting is not revealed in the book, Gaddafi’s Harem: The Story of a Young Woman and the Abuse of Power in Libya, by French author Annick Cojean. Mr Blair’s first visit to see Gaddafi was in 2004 – the year Soraya was handpicked to join the dictator’s harem.

Meeting: Blair met Gaddafi several times as Prime Minister and Peace Envoy, later complementing him for his hospitality

At the time, Mr Blair – then prime minister – was accused of doing his so-called ‘dodgy deals in the desert’. 

Gaddafi had renounced terrorism, but was known to have been behind the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 and the 1984 murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher.

Mr Blair made two further visits to Libya in his role as a peace envoy, in 2008 and 2009, later writing a gushing letter thanking Gaddafi for his hospitality. Details of the abuse emerged after Gaddafi’s death at the hands of anti-government rebels in 2011.

Soraya told her startling story in Gaddafi's Harem: The Story of a Young Woman and the Abuses of Power in Libya

‘He was repulsive,’ said Soraya. ‘And he was president of my country.’

She said during her time as his sex slave she was kept locked in a windowless basement and girls were forced to watch porn films so they could learn how to perform to his satisfaction.

Soraya said she was beaten so savagely that she was left with the ‘chest of an old lady’. 

Gaddafi simply referred to her as his ‘whore’ and his sex slaves were so psychologically damaged they rarely considered escape. Any who did, usually to Turkey, were tracked down and killed, the book claims.

The despot was said to have demanded sex up to four times a day and would take Viagra to keep up his ‘insatiable’ demands.

He would ‘shop’ for victims at weddings, schools and summits – and kept a secret flat at the University of Tripoli where he abducted and raped students.

The book describes how Soraya was handpicked by Gaddafi during a visit to her school in 2004.Three days later, she was told she was going to meet ‘Papa Moammar’, who told her: ‘I am your Papa. 

‘But I am your brother as well, and soon I will be your lover.’

Soraya, who now lives alone in Tripoli, said she was stunned by his hypocrisy. 

Despite professing to be a good Muslim, she said he drank and smoked and ignored sacrifices such as celibacy or fasting that are required during the holy month of Ramadan.

She claims how another sex slave told her: ‘It’s Ramadan – Gaddafi style.’

A spokesman for Mr Blair was unavailable for comment.
