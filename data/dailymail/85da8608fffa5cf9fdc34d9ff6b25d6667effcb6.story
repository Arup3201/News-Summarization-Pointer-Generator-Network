Before she killed her son and the little girl she was supposed to be babysitting, prosecutors say thatÂ  Elzbieta M. Plackowska, 40, told them they were going to heaven and to get down on their knees and pray.

Police found Plackowska covered in blood inside a suburban Naperville, Illinois, home and after extensive questioning, she allegedly told police that she murdered her son Justin, 7, and his friend Olivia Dworakowski because they 'had evil inside of them.'

Prosecutors before a judge this morning said that Plackowska was fighting with her husband and felt unappreciated as a babysitter, so she murdered the children in a fit of rage.

Murder charge: Elzbieta Plackowska and her son Justin (right), who was stabbed to death

Justin was found stabbed 100 times. Olivia was stabbed 50 times. Plackowska was denied bail.

'She told Justin he was going to heaven tonight as she repeatedly stabbed him,' DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin said to the court, according to the Daily Herald.

'He begged her to stop and said he loved her.'

Mr Berlin described the scene that unfolded before the grisly murder, saying that the two children were jumping on their beds in Olivia's home, where Plackowska was meant to be babysitting her.

The babysitter then ordered them to get down on the floor and pray before bed.

'The children had evil inside of them,' Plackowska allegedly told police.

Mr Berlin said she 'was trying to drive the evil out of them. She said the devil was inside them.'

Both children's throats were slit and Justin was found in a bed, Olivia on the floor.

Prosecutors say that after Plackowska killed the innocents, she started frantically calling a local church, leaving numerous messages.

She then went to a friend's house and
 claimed someone had robbed her. Her friend was suspicious of the story 
because the details kept changing, Mr Berlin said.

Meanwhile, Olivia's mother Marta 
Dworakowski, a nurse, called police because when she returned home from 
her night shift, Plackowska's car wasn't there and she could not get 
into the house.

Police were able to get inside the 
suburban home on Quin Court just after 10pm and found blood all over the
 hallway, leading them to the children's bedroom.

'Both victims had been stabbed numerous times,' Mr Berlin said. 'It appeared to police both victims' throats had been slashed.'

Officers also found that the family's two dogs were also stabbed to death.

When questioned by police, Plackowska
 told them several stories, including one in which a stalker attacked 
her own wrists. Eventually, they said, she admitted to killing the 
children.

She told them that she had been 
fighting with her husband Artur, a truck driver, about his work schedule
 and felt taken advantage of as a babysitter. The pair has a college age
 son as well who has not been named.

Sources told the Daily Herald that 
Plackowska had been stressed for several days following the death of her
 father and she was anxious to return to Poland, a decision her husband 
objected to.

Olivia was a kindergartner from Brookdale Elementary School and Justin attended Scott School in Naperville District 203.

Police say that Plackowska is on suicide watch at the jail after she was charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

'In all my years in law enforcement, 
this was the most horrific and gruesome crime scene I have seen,' 
Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall said after the hearing today to 
the Chicago Tribune.

The tragedy comes less than a week 
after a New York City baby sitter allegedly stabbed to death two young 
children who were in her care before slashing her own throat and wrists 
in an attempt to take her life.
