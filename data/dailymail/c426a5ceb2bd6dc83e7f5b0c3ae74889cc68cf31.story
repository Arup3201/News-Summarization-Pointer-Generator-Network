Minister James Brokenshire insisted 97 per cent of standard passports were being processed on time

The passport crisis has thrown the spotlight on little-known immigration minister James Brokenshire after he spectacularly misjudged the gravity of the situation.

Despite backlogs of 500,000 applications and travellers being forced to cancel holidays and business trips because of delayed documents, Mr Brokenshire blithely insisted HM Passport Office was on top of the issue.

Even yesterday the crisis showed no sign of easing with queues snaking out of Passport Offices up and down the country.

In a Commons adjournment debate on Tuesday, followed by an interview with Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, the Tory minister insisted that 97 per cent of standard passports were being processed on time within three weeks.

In fact, he maintained, the ‘significant surge’ of applications was good news – ‘an indication that as the economy is improving, more people are understandably planning to travel’.

And there was definitely no crisis. In his radio interview, he said: ‘It is certainly fair to say the Passport Office has seen a significant increase in demand for its service during the months of this year between January and now.

‘But the Passport Office’s figures for performance are showing that for those straightforward cases of renewals, child applications, that they’re turning those around at around 97 per cent in three weeks, 99 per cent in four weeks.’

But a day later, David Cameron said ‘sorry’ for the fiasco as emergency measures were brought in to tackle the backlog – three weeks after it was first highlighted by the Daily Mail.

Home Secretary Theresa May also initially rejected claims the passport service was in chaos but said ‘very, very high’ demand for passports had caused some delays.

A day later, the Mail revealed that families hit by the passport crisis were being asked to pay £55.50 extra per person to save their summer holidays by fast-tracking their documents.

It prompted Mrs May to promise that new office space would be opened at Liverpool’s centre to allow for 100 extra staff.

A leaked Passport Office document showed staff had been ordered to relax checks on overseas-based passport applicants.

Embarrassed ministers said they had no knowledge of the instruction and told managers to withdraw it.

On Thursday, Mrs May brought in emergency measures as she finally admitted the Passport Office was in crisis.
