Colin Kaepernick just entered the realm of elite NFL quarterbacks - signing a six-year contract worth $126million with the San Francisco 49ers.

And with all his new found cash, the 26-year-old quarterback rightfully decided to celebrate - by throwing a pool party, and a very G-rated one, at that.

Kaepernick posted pictures from his 'lavish' get-together on his Instagram page. They show Kaepernick holding his baby nephew, chilling with his father, his brother and his brother-in-law and wrestling for a chew toy with his dog.

The images are a stark contrast to the Las Vegas pool party newly-minted star Johnny Manziel attended after he was drafted into the NFL by the Cleveland Browns last month.

Pictures emerged of notorious playboy 'Johnny Football' hanging out with a bevy of bikini-clad beauties and a slew of celebrities.

Kaepernick seems to acknowledge the contrast, commenting that he is 'trolling' - faking out his fans - with the wholesome images.

The star quarterback, who was born to a teenage mother who gave him up for adoption, has worked hard to cut a wholesome public image.

He speaks often about his Christian faith and has parts of several Bible verses tattooed on his body, including the phrase 'To God the Glory.'

Despite helping to lead the 49ers to a Super Bowl in his first season as starting quarterback and to the NFC Championship game last year, Kaepernick earned just $740,000 - the 26th highest salary on the team.

When asked what he was planning to do with his new found wealth, he told reporters his first priority was to 'make sure everyone in my family is set.'
