A British tourist has died after the snowmobile she was driving hit a tree.

Charlotte Mei Ling Lee, 31, lost control on a mountain trail in Canada.

Miss Lee, a magistrates’ court assistant from Portishead, Bristol, suffered severe head injuries and died in hospital five days later.

Her boyfriend Domynique Tamaire, a 
passenger on the rented snowmobile, was seriously hurt in the crash at 
Ferme-Neuve, 100 miles north of Montreal, last Saturday.

Miss
 Lee’s family flew to her bedside where on Thursday they decided to 
switch off her ventilator and donate her organs for transplant.

Messages of support to Mr Tamaire have been flooding in on Facebook.

One from Bon Rayment read: ‘I don't know what to say to you Dom as no words will make this tragedy any better but I wanted you to know that we are thinking of you and send you lots of love.

‘I hope you make a speedy recovery from injuries. Thank you for making Charlotte so happy since she met you.’

Another, from Annabel Stewart, said: ‘I'm so sorry she is gone as you made each other so happy. We are all thinking of you and sending you love.’

Ms Lee was negotiating a mountain trail when she suffered catastrophic head injuries during a festive holiday with Mr Tamaire.

He was a passenger on the vehicle and was also seriously hurt in the smash in picturesque Ferme-Neuve, Quebec.

The pair were rushed to hospital where they were later joined by Charlotte's distraught family, who flew to her bedside from their home in Bristol.

But five days after the crash they made the agonising decision switch off her ventilator and donate her organs.

In a statement, mum Elaine, dad Frank and sisters Helen and Jenny said: ‘We are all absolutely devastated by the loss of our beautiful, tender-hearted Charlotte.

‘Although our hearts are broken we are taking great comfort from the overwhelming amount of love, support, kind message and generosity of the many people that have been in touch.

‘Charlotte was loved by so many people and will forever be in our hearts.’

The accident happened at a popular spot for trekking and outdoor activities on Saturday.

Tragedy: Ms Lee was treated at Montreal hospital, but her life support was turned off after five days

Local police say Ms Lee - known as Lottie to pals - had little experience driving the rented snowmobile and might have lost control while doing a ‘bad manoeuvre’.

The magistrates court assistant was transferred 100 miles to Montreal Hospital after the incident.

A spokesman for the Quebec Provincial Police said: ‘A young woman from the UK was involved in a snowmobile accident which was driven into a tree.

‘It appears she was driving along a trail and lost control of the machine, maybe she did a bad manoeuvre.

‘The snowmobile had been rented and there is some evidence that she did not have a lot of experience when it came to driving the machine.

‘She suffered major head injuries and the man who was with her also suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries.

‘Both of the victims were transported to hospital but the woman died later at the hospital.’

It is understood her family are still in Canada arranging repatriation.

An online appeal to help her family from Portishead, Bristol, foot the medical bills has already raised more than £12,000.

On Thursday a family friend said they had now discovered Ms Lee had insurance which will cover the bills and potentially the full cost of repatriation.

But donations have continued to pour in, and website creator Janie Digby said the money will now probably be put towards her funeral, the family's travelling costs or donated to a charity in Ms Lee's name.

In an online message she said: ‘Your messages of support and enormously generous donations have really touched us and we don't think that we will ever be able to fully express our gratitude.

‘It's been a truly terrible week, but knowing that so many people care, send their support and want to help has been a huge comfort to Jenny and Elaine.’

When Ms Lee was declared dead by the Montreal Coroner on Thursday, she posted: ‘Her body remains on a ventilator as her parents have made the very generous and brave decision to donate her organs for life saving purposes.

‘The recipients of the donated organs will be prepared and the family anticipate that this and the turning off of the ventilator will take place this evening Canadian time.

‘Charlotte's sisters Helen and Jenny are so touched by how many of you have been wishing Charlotte and the family well and we are all completely blown away by the generosity of people donating to Charlotte's fund.’
