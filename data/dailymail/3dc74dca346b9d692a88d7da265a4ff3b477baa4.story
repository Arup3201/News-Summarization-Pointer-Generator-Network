A dozen of the United States Air Force’s most feared attack aircraft are to be deployed in the battle against ISIS.

Twelve A-10 ‘Warthogs’ are being moved from Afghanistan to Kuwait to carry out patrols against the Islamic State militants who have taken swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory.

The new deployment will boost the USAF’s ability to patrol the skies and take out ISIS targets.

Deadly force: A line up of A-10s at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. Planes of this type will arrive in Kuwait for combat operations next week

Slow and steady: An unarmed A-10 shows the maneuverability which makes it a deadly foe to ground forces. It can fly steadily at slow speed at just 50 feet above enemy positions and is heavily armored against gunfire

In action: An A-10 above Afghanistan, where it has been used with deadly effect against the Taliban. As well as its 30mm cannon which can be seen on the nose, it is carrying missiles under the inner wing 

Close support: A-10s work closely with ground troops including, here, US Special Forces units in Afghanistan

They will be joined within weeks by around six Reaper drones armed with missiles, the New York Times reported.

The new weaponry marks an increase in the options open to military planners who have struggled to strike ISIS.

A-10s, originally designed to destroy Soviet tank squadrons if the USSR had invaded the West, have proved a deadly weapon against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.

Slow-moving and equipped with a devastating 30mm cannon capable of firing almost 4,000 rounds a minute - as well as missiles and 500lb bombs -  they can fly as low as 50ft and engage targets far more slowly than the bombers and fighter-bombers which have so far been deployed in Iraq and Syria.

The decision to deploy A-10s and Reapers comes after a major battle-planning conference involving more than 200 commanders from 33 countries involved in the fight against ISIS.

America remains by far the largest single country involved, but has now received backing from more Muslim countries.

Morocco is to send F-16s to attack the militants under the US-led operation.

However the main concern over the campaign has been the lack of targets to strike because of the nature of ISIS, which combines large groups acting like a conventional army, with insurgency tactics.

Unmanned: A Reaper preparing for take-off. Some of its missile load can be seen under the left wing

Remote control: Pilots at Hollman Air Force Base in New Mexico at the controls of a Reaper during a training mission. The Iraq and Syria missions against ISIS will be flown from Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina

Target: ISIS fighters will be firmly in the sights of A-10 pilots. The light weaponry they carry is unable to damage an A-10, while it can hit them with 4,000 30mm rounds in just a minute.

Takeover: The ISIS threat to Iraq and Syria was demonstrated when the militant group took control of the Syrian town of Raqqa. It has mounted shows of strength in the town and beyond

Frontline: These ISIS fighters near Aleppo are typical of the targets for the A-10. Lightly armed and on the move, they are difficult for bombers and strike fighters to target but can be stalked from the air by the A-10s, which loiter over targets for hours

It is the ugliest aircraft in the Air Force's arsenal.

The A-10 was designed to destroy Soviet tanks and troops on the ground.

Officially the Thunderbolt II, it was quickly nicknamed the Warthog for its unusual looks, 

It was specifically designed around its main weapon, a 30mm cannon which fires 4,000 rounds a minute.

The plane can fly low and slow, coming down to 50ft to shoot at or drop bombs on enemy positions.

Its top speed is just above 400mph but it can go as slow as 150mph and 'loiter' for hours above targets making it an effective deterrent as well as an attack plane.

The Warthog is covered in 1,200lbs of titanium armor, making it invulnerable to attack from anything but heavy weapons.

Even when hit it is designed to fly home on one engine, with no tailfin and half a wing missing.

On board the single-seater the pilot has at his controls the cannon, which is accurate to 4,000ft, and fires depleted-uranium shells, as well as Maverick air-to-surface missiles, 500lb free fall bombs, and Hydra air-launched rockets.

Despite USAF attempts to retire the fleet, it is expected to remain in service into the 2020s. At one stage when the Air Force suggested retiring its more than 300 A-10s the Army indicated it would take them over as soldiers are so keen on its close support capabilities. 

Figures published in the New York Times show that just one in four missions over the last three months actually involves dropping bombs or firing missiles.

Three-quarters of planes return to base without having deployed their armament.

Planners are concentrating on what they have called ‘pop-up targets’ - convoys of ISIS fighters, or individual leaders – which are targeted as soon as they are identified by analysts.

The deployment of A-10s and Reapers will increase the ability to take on such targets.

Both can circle slowly above target areas for hours at a time. In the case of A-10s they can swoop as low as 50ft and maintain a presence above enemy positions at low speed.

They are also heavily armoured against small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades and designed to keep flying while under fire.

In Afghanistan they have successfully targeted Taliban positions just yards from American patrols and are admired by the Army as a psychological weapon which keeps the Taliban at bay.

But much of the success – or failure – of the mission against ISIS depends on the instructions pilots at the controls of the A-10s will receive.

Such is the concern that the operation avoid civilian casualties which would hand ISIS a propaganda victory that the list of targets is approved by the head of Central Command, General Lloyd Austin.

It is based on information from spy satellites, U-2 spy aircraft flying at 70,000 feet above the Middle East, and intelligence from the ground, where special forces are believed to be working, as well as the CIA.

One of his officers admitted in the New York Times that the operation was fraught with difficulties.

Major Sonny Alberdeston told the newspaper’s Eric Schmitt: ‘When we target a nation-state, we’ve typically been looking at their capability for decades and have extensive target sets.

‘But these guys are moving around. They can be in place, and then a week later, they’re gone.’

ISIS has now been under attack from the air for almost three months but continues to pump out propaganda and have control of territory in Iraq and Syria.

President Obama has been facing calls for more radical action against them, with Republican Senator Rand Paul earlier this month arguing in favour of limited ‘boots on the ground’ to go after its leadership.
