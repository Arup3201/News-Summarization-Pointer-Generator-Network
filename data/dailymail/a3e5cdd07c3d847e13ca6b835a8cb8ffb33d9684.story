Wellington are top of the Daily Mail Schools Trophy again thanks to Kirkham ending Sedbergh’s short reign. 

A quick start and some excellent defence helped the Lancastrians to beat their Cumbrian rivals for the first time in 14 years. 

Kirkham won 22-12 to remain unbeaten in the Trophy, which is run on a merit table basis by schoolsrugby.co.uk, and to bolster their own challenge which puts them in third place behind Wellington and Sedbergh.

Sedbergh had taken the Trophy lead last week by toppling Wellington in a memorable evening game at Broadstreet, 37-34, only to fall from first place by then losing at home to Kirkham. 

Kirkham have won eight Trophy games thanks to an all-round team led against Sedbergh by halfbacks Conor Dever and Conor Wilkinson.

First-half opportunities were finished off by two tries from Juan du Randt to be followed by an excellent individual effort from fellow centre Owain Davies. 

‘We’ve crept up the table a little bit unnoticed,’ commented Kirkham’s Aled Trenhaile whose team now head to Mount St Mary’s on Saturday.

Wellington took full advantage of Sedbergh’s defeat by sweeping aside Epsom College, 37-10, to regain the leadership. 

Sam Aspland-Robinson, who had scored three against Sedbergh, added two more alongside a brace from fellow three-quarter Conor Dolan.

Woodhouse Grove, the inaugural winners in 2013, have gradually put a new team together this term and that promise was highlighted by the Bradford school becoming the first team to beat Grammar Schools at Leeds, 22-0.

Second-half tries from George Styles, Henry Boggie and Tom Fountain maintained Grove’s record of only losing once to their Yorkshire rivals in 11 years. 

The Leeds school had led the Trophy for the first two months up until Wellington and Sedbergh caught up in games played last month.

Grove may yet have a big say in Kirkham’s fate as they host the Lancastrians on Saturday week, Nov 29.

The outsiders for the Trophy – which is decided over games during the autumn term – are Monmouth. 

The Welsh school have risen to fourth place following a seven games unbeaten, including wins over Bromsgrove, Colston’s and King’s Worcester.
