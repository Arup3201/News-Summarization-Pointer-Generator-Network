US Air Force and RAF pilots had a mid-air row in the skies over Norfolk after the American pilot accused a Tornado of flying too close to parachutists during an exercise, according to a new report.

The pilot of the American MC-130 transport craft filed a near-miss report about a Tornado GR4 fighter, claiming it came too close to the parachutists it had dropped near the village of Sculthorpe last November.

After the US pilot radioed a warning to the British fighter, the Tornado pilot radioed back that he 'had every right to be here' according to a UK AirProx Board (UKAB) review of the incident.

The aircraft came within two miles of each other at their closest point, according to the UKAB, which investigates near-misses.

The USAF pilot claimed there was a 'high' risk to the parachutists during the incident.

But the RAF pilot, flying one of several Tornados in the area in November 7, told the UKAB they had been visible at all times and the severity of the incident was 'low'.

Local military air traffic control reported it as 'negligible'.

The UKAB report said the USAF pilot was 
'clearly frustrated by the continued presence of the Tornados' but it 
had determined there was no risk to the parachutists.

The report states: 'The Board quickly agreed that both the MC130 and the Tornado pilots were entitled to be operating in the area and blocks reported.'

Some members of the investigation board felt the Tornado pilots could have been more flexible, it said.

It added: 'However, members felt that the mis-match in perception could quite easily have been prevented with the application of effective co-ordination between these two units who both commonly use the busy East Anglian airspace.'
