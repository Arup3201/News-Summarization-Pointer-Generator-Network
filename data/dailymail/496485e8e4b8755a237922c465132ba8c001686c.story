The things people do to earn a crust… this unknown Thai bites and lifts with his mouth a deadly banded krait to amuse a crowd.

With his lips perched millimetres from the snake’s sharp and lethal fangs, the man slowly lowers his head and grabs the highly venomous black and yellow snake between his teeth.

But the snake quickly wraps itself around his head in a show of defence - forcing the snake charmer to unravel it.

The Thai - performing in a show at Schlangenfarm and Snake Show in Pattaya, Thailand - even finds time to take a quick bow to the crowd.

And then later in the show, he crouches to kiss another venomous Siamese Cobra on the lips.

The snake charmer is believed to have worked at the park for a number of years and built a rapport with the snakes.

However, Scottish tourist Ian Maclean, who witnessed the show, said: "I've seen a lot of these shows and the guys come and go or more likely die from snake bites.’

Luckily, the show is located within a stone’s throw of a Red Cross Institute, which specialises in treating snake bites from Thailand's myriad of deadly critters.
