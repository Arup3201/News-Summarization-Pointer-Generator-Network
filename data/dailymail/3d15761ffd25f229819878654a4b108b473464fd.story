Mahmudul Choudhury, 35, admitted sharing the 'offensive' image of Hitler on his Facebook page

A  teacher has been fined after he admitted posting a picture Hitler on Facebook with the words 'you were right'.

Mahmudul Choudhury, 35, from Tower Hamlets, east London, was reported to police for sharing the image by a Jewish student who he had previously added on the social networking site.

He pleaded guilty to the racially aggravated offence at an earlier hearing and was told he could face losing his job, as he is still employed as a teacher.

The father-of-two shared the photo of Hitler, which is accompanied with the words 'Yes man, you were right... I could have killed all the Jews, but I left some of them to let you know why I was killing them. Share this picture to tell the truth a whole world'.

He added the caption: 'Yes now we can see why' #ProtectiveEdge.'

Choudhury wore a suit and tie when he appeared at Bromley Magistrates Court yesterday, where he was fined £465. 

Toyin Odumade, prosecuting said: 'On July 11 of last year Mr Choudhury had posted an image on his Facebook account of Adolf Hitler.

'This Facebook poster was seen at the school where Mr Choudhury worked, this pupil is Jewish and it caused him distress so alerted the police.

'This led to Mr Choudhury being arrested and taken to the police station where he was interviewed.

'In this interviewed he said he had been on Facebook for four years and he kept his Facebook account up to date about what was going on in the world and sometimes posted things of freedom of speech and political stuff but never anything racist.

'He was shown the poster on his Facebook account and he confirmed it was his Facebook profile. He said the poster had been sent to him but he had shared it accidentally.

'When asked about the caption above it he admitted writing it but stated that he posted the image by accident.

The Facebook post (pictured) stated: 'Yes man, you were right... I could have killed all the Jews, but I left some of them to let you know why I was killing them. Share this picture to tell the truth a whole world'

'Later in his interview he said he could understand why people could find the image offensive but stated that he didn't want to offend anybody and that is was an accident.

'He was subsequently charged with the offence.'

The student who reported him to the police previously attended  Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College in New Cross, south east London, where Choudhury used to teach.

Subhankar Banerjee, defending, told the court: 'This is a young man in his mid-30's, a family man of impeccable good character, never been spoken to by the police before who was absolutely adamant he holds no anti-semitic or other extremist views.'

Mr Banerjee added that his client took full responsibility for what happened and it is now possible he may lose his job because of it.

Jonathan Sacerdoti, Director of Communications at the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: 'Teachers have a special responsibility in our society and shape the minds of our children.

'Mahmudul Choudhury cannot plead ignorance and has today been spared any meaningful punishment for spreading a hateful message which helps create the climate in which Jews are currently being killed across Europe.

'We commend the police and CPS for pursuing this case with zero tolerance but unreservedly condemn this inexplicably lenient sentence and now expect an investigation into how someone who spread Jew hatred online came to be teaching London's children.'

Lead magistrate, Shirley Muckell, told him: 'Obviously reading through this and the letters you're a well thought of person and this is going to put your standing down a lot.

'It's something that, we know you have now given up Facebook, but social media can cause a lot of problems as you found out the hard way.

'We have taken everything into consideration as what has been said and also that you pleaded guilty to this matter at the earliest opportunity.'
