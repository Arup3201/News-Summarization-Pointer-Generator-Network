More than 650 items belonging to former President Kennedy were found locked away at the home of a former aide who worked alongside the president for his entire political career.

The lot, which includes rare photographs, clothing and other personal items will be auctioned off next month.

The items were recently discovered at the home of David F. Powers, who was special assistant to Kennedy during his years in the White House and started working for him in 1946.
