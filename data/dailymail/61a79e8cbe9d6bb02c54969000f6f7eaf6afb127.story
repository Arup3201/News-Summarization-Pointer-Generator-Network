Under pressure from federal regulators, Honda is expanding a recall of potentially lethal driver's side airbags to all 50 U.S. states.

The inflators, made by Japanese supplier Takata Corp., can explode with too much force under certain conditions, sending deadly metal shrapnel into the passenger compartment.

The defect has has so far been linked to at least five deaths in the U.S. and many more injuries.

Under pressure : Honda is expanding a recall of potentially lethal driver's side airbags to all 50 U.S. states

Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando was among those fatally wounded.

She died in October after a minor crash in her 2001 Honda Accord caused the airbag to deploy.

Police believed she'd been the victim of a stabbing because of the severe nature of her injuries,  according to her family's lawsuit.

But an autopsy revealed metal and plastic fragments from an exploding airbag caused her death.  

One incident from 2010 didn't involve a crash at all.

Instead, a lawsuit claims that Kristy Williams was stopped at a red light in her 2001 Honda Civic when the airbag deployed.

Victim: A lawsuit alleges that Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando was struck by plastic and metal shrapnel after a Takata airbag deployed in her 2001 Honda Accord during a minor accident

Deadly: A metal component of the airbag that critically injured Tran is shown, as Takata deals with allegations that their airbags have caused numerous fatalities while the company covered up faulty parts

Metal fragments sliced into her neck, hitting her carotid artery, and Williams was only able to survive by placing two fingers into the wound to limit the bleeding.

Afterwards, the lawsuit alleges, she suffered strokes and was left with traumatic brain injury. 

Takata insists that current Honda recalls covering 8 million U.S. cars in high-humidity areas - where moisture in the air can trigger an explosion - are sufficient.

But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants the order expanded nationwide after some incidents outside the high-humidity zones.

Rick Schosteck, Honda's executive vice president for North America, told House lawmakers Wednesday that Honda will expand the regional recall it began in June, but will continue to prioritize high-humidity areas.

These spots include Florida, Puerto Rico, areas near the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, as well as Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Hawaii.

Schosteck also said Honda is working with other air bag manufacturers to make sure it has enough parts.

Q: How can I find out if my car has been recalled?

A: Dozens of models made by BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Mazda, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota dating to the 2001 model year are covered. You should have received a recall notice from your automaker. Also, you can go to www.safercar.gov and key in your vehicle identification number, which normally is printed on your registration and stamped on the dashboard. That will tell you if your car is being recalled. You can also call your dealer. Honda is Takata's largest customer, and has so far recalled over 5 million vehicles in the U.S. alone

Q: Why are some of the recalls just in areas with high humidity?

A: Government investigators and Takata officials believe that prolonged exposure to moisture in the air makes the inflator chemical, ammonium nitrate, burn too fast, creating too much pressure. That can cause the metal inflator canisters to shatter, spewing shrapnel into drivers and passengers. They're still conducting tests on inflators replaced by dealers to figure out what level of humidity causes the problem. Initially the recall areas were limited to Florida, Puerto Rico, areas near the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, as well as Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Hawaii.

Q: I live outside the recall areas, but the humidity is still high. Is my car safe?

A: The short answer is no one is sure because the problem is still under investigation. This has some car owners confused and worried. Investigators think they have found a concentration of defective inflators inside the high-humidity zone. But there are still a lot of humid locations outside those areas. Takata says the cars are safe if they're outside the high-humidity area. It's difficult to tell if your car has a Takata air bag inflator. You can try asking your dealer, but even they may not know.

Q: Why doesn't the government just order a national recall of all Takata air bag inflators?

A: Safety regulators say two incidents outside of current recall zones involving driver's side air bags are cause for a national recall. Takata disagrees. That could mean civil fines and a court date for Takata. Regulators can go to court to force Takata to do a recall, but they have to hold a public hearing first.

Q: What's next?

A: Other automakers are likely to follow Honda's lead in doing a national driver's side recall. And the investigation will continue into passenger side problems. Takata could wind up being fined and face court action for defying the government's demand for the national recall.
