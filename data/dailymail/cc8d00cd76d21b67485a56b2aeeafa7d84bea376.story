The father of a teenager who drowned in the River Avon paid tribute yesterday to his ‘chip off the old block’.

Jay Burgess said 14-year-old Aaron was ‘always acting the fool’, adding that his son was ‘beautiful’.

Aaron was one of two teenagers who drowned on Tuesday while cooling off during the mini-heatwave in the south of the country.

Tragedy: Aaron Burgess, 14, drowned on a stretch of the River Avon between Bath and Bristol. His body was found six hours after he disappeared

And emergency services were last night searching for another teenage boy, who fell into water at a quarry in the West Midlands.

The series of accidents at the 
beginning of the school holidays has led to warnings for children to 
stay away from dangerous swimming locations.

Mr Burgess, of Longwell Green, near 
Bristol, was joined on the banks of the river by more than 50 of his 
son’s friends, who laid flowers and held a candlelit vigil.

Aaron had been sliding down a weir 
when he disappeared beneath the water at around 5.40pm. Police divers 
recovered his body six hours later.

The second boy to die on Tuesday was 
15-year-old Daniel James McCullagh, who had been swimming in the River 
Nene near his home in Woodford, Northamptonshire. It is believed Daniel 
had been jumping into the water with friends moments before the tragedy 
at 3pm.

His friends tried to save him when his
body slipped under the water, but he was swept away by the strong 
current. Rescue crews found his body just over three hours later, almost
half a mile away from where he disappeared.

Daniel’s father Gabriel last night described him as a ‘lovely, funny lad who just wanted to fit in and have loads of friends’.

He put a message on Facebook thanking people for their kind words and saying that he and Daniel’s mother were ‘heartbroken’.

In the latest incident, rescue crews 
were last night still searching for a 14-year-old who fell into a 
waterlogged quarry in Dudley.

The teenager is believed to have been 
sunbathing with friends at the site, known locally as ‘blue lagoon’, 
when he slipped and fell into the water, which police said was up to 
20ft deep.

Grief: A group of girls leave flowers at the scene

The Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents yesterday urged people to stay away from rivers, quarries 
and lakes and instead head to beaches, lidos and swimming pools.

David Walker, head of leisure safety 
at RoSPA, said: ‘We understand the temptation to want to go swimming in 
rivers, quarries and lakes, especially during the recent hot weather.

‘Among the hazards to consider at 
inland waters are that, even on a hot day, water might be a lot colder 
than you were expecting and there may be strong currents and underwater 
debris that you cannot see from the bank.

‘Consider how you are going to get out of the water before you get in, and be honest about your ability to look after yourself.’

Body: Aaron's body was recovered by police divers near to The Jolly Sailor pub in Saltford, Somerset
