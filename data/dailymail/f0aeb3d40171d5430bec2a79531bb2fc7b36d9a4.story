Zlatan Ibrahimovic is glad to be back into the 'full swing' of pre-season training as the Paris Saint-Germain striker prepares to defend the French club's Ligue 1 title.

Ibrahimovic wasn't able to compete in Brazil at the World Cup as Sweden failed to qualify, but the 32-year-old seems happy enough to be getting fit for the new season.

Ibrahimovic took to Instagram to post a picture of himself on a treadmill, and said: 'Finally pre-season training is in full swing. Cardio in combination with strength and stability.'

PSG's league campaign gets underway on August 8 when they take on Stade de Reims away from home.

Ibrahimovic will be hungry to build on his incredible record, having scored 56 goals in 67 league appearances for PSG so far.
