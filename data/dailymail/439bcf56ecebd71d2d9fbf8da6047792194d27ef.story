A Nato commander yesterday told of his agony following the disappearance of his 14-year-old daughter nine days ago.

Mark Smith said he was ‘worried sick’ about daughter Esme, who vanished after telling friends she was going to a party near her Surrey home.

She was last seen getting off a train at London’s Waterloo station about an hour from her address.  Mr Smith, who works at Nato’s Joint Warfare Centre in Stavanger, Norway, said: ‘We are worried sick. She’s just gone to ground.

‘We’re baffled. We are working very closely with the police and doing everything through them. They are doing a great job.’

Mr Smith, a former lieutenant-commander in the Royal Navy, has been decorated for service in Afghanistan, the Gulf War and Northern Ireland, according to his page on the professional networking site LinkedIn. Since March last year, he has been at the Norwegian Nato base where he is commander of medical planning.

The family spoke out after detectives yesterday released new CCTV footage of Esme near Charing Cross station – across the Thames from Waterloo.

Baffled: Father Mark Smith is out of ideas as to where his daughter could be

Taken from the back, it shows her heading towards Villiers Street in central London at around 5.30pm on Thursday last week wearing the white flowery dress and denim jacket she had earlier changed into from her school uniform.

Police are growing increasingly worried about the safety of the teenager, who is described by her sister as an ‘extrovert and ‘vivacious’.

She left All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham, Surrey, at about 3.15pm on September 12 and has not been seen or heard from by her family or friends since.

The schoolgirl took a train from Aldershot to Waterloo at 4.04pm, after telling school friends she was going to Woking and then on to a party. She was spotted on CCTV at Waterloo at about 5pm, carrying a black school bag and a black floral bag with chain straps.

It is believed she also took with her a black dress with a sheer mesh top. Neighbours at the detached home in Farnham where she lives with her father and mother Dinah, 50, spoke of their shock at her disappearance.

Paul Gray, 48, said: ‘She’s a smashing kid, really bubbly and very chatty, the kind of kid who would stop and say hello and chat, not like most other teenagers.’

The business development manager added: ‘You just think, what the hell has driven a child to do this?’

Detective Inspector Martin Stables, of Surrey Police’s missing persons unit, urged Esme to get in touch. He added: ‘It’s now over a week since Esme went missing and it is an anxious time for the family as they wait for news.’

Her 19-year-old sister, Sian, has already made an emotional appeal to Esme, saying: ‘We are all really worried about you and we just want to make sure you are OK.’

Anyone with information should call Surrey Police on 101, quoting reference M/13/900. The charity Missing People can also be contacted anonymously on 116 000.

Missing: Esme Smith, 14, who has not been seen since getting the train to London to go to a party a week ago

A new CCTV image has been released by detectives searching for a 14-year-old schoolgirl who has been missing for more than a week.

It shows Esme Smith walking down steps near Charing Cross station in London at about 5.30pm last Thursday - the day she vanished.

Esme parted from friends after school in her home town of Farnham, Surrey, telling them she was going to a party - then boarded a train to London and was last seen shortly after arriving at Waterloo station, approximately 40 miles from where she lives.

The teenager told her friends she was 
going to Woking, 16 miles away, but instead changed out of her school 
uniform and caught a train from Aldershot just after 4pm, and arrived in
London about an hour later.

Esme, described as an 'extrovert, vivacious, normal' teenager, has not been seen by her family or made contact with them since.

Detective
inspector Martin Stables, of Surrey Police’s missing persons unit, 
said: 'It’s now over a week since Esme went missing and it is an anxious
time for the family as they wait for news.

'I am hoping these latest 
pictures may draw more information from the public about where Esme may 
be.'

As the search continues, more than 4,000 people have 'liked' a 
Facebook page called Find Esme Smith, dedicated to raising awareness of 
her disappearance.

One poster wrote: 'Esme, look how many people care!'

Another wrote: 'God bless this girl and get her home safe.'

Esme’s sister Sian this week made an emotional appeal for her sister’s safe return, saying: 'We just want her back.'

She
said: 'I think she’s maybe met somebody out there or planned to meet 
somebody. We just don’t know at the moment, and that’s the worrying 
thing.'

Missing teenager: Esme's sister Sian, 19, today pleaded for her to get in touch

On
Twitter, people retweeted pictures and news reports on the 
disappearance of Esme, a pupil at All Hallows Catholic School in 
Farnham.

In previously-released images, CCTV captured at Waterloo shows Esme wearing a white flowery dress and a denim jacket.

She
was carrying a black school bag and black floral bag with chain straps.
It is believed she also took with her a black dress which has a sheer 
mesh top.

Mr Stables said: 'My team are carrying out extensive 
inquiries in and around the local and London areas to find Esme, and 
anyone who has seen a girl matching her description or who knows about 
her whereabouts should call Surrey Police.

'Similarly, Esme if you see 
any of the media appeals please let us know that you are safe and well.'

Esme
is white, 5ft 3in, and of slim to medium build, with shoulder-length 
brown hair that may be tied in a bun. She has brown eyes and a tanned 
complexion and wears size six shoes.

Last Sian, sent out a plea to her sister.

She
said: ‘Esme, if you are reading this, I just want to say please come 
home or at least get in touch so that we know that you are safe.

‘We are all really worried about you and we just want to make sure you are OK.

‘You are not in any trouble so please just get in touch.’

Last night Esme’s mother, Dinah Smith, 39, was too upset to talk at the family’s detached home in Farnham, Surrey – which she shares with the schoolgirl’s father, 50-year-old Mark Smith.

Detective Sergeant Antony Preston from Surrey Police Missing Persons Unit said: ‘We are following up a number of lines of enquiry and we have had a number of calls as to Esme’s whereabouts, but as time goes on our concerns about her welfare remain.

‘Anyone who has seen a girl matching her description or who knows her and has any information about her whereabouts is urged to contact us as soon as possible. Similarly, if Esme sees this appeal, please get in touch to confirm that you are safe and well.’

Esme was last seen by her friends when she left All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham at around 3.15pm last Thursday.

She told them that she was travelling to Woking and would then be going on to a party.

But the brunette boarded a train at Aldershot station just after 4pm and was then filmed on CCTV getting off a train at London Waterloo around 5pm.

Police have issued several photographs of the teenager and a spokesman for the Surrey force said: ‘Esme is described  as white, 5ft 3in tall, slim to medium build, with shoulder-length brown hair that may be tied in a bun.

‘She has brown eyes and a tanned complexion and wears size six shoes.’

Officers have launched a ‘Twitter reconstruction’, using the social networking site to post details of the teenager’s last known movements along with pictures of her in the hope of jogging people’s memories.

Police said that although she may be in London they are also considering the possibility that she may have moved on to somewhere outside the capital.

Anyone with information should call Surrey Police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
