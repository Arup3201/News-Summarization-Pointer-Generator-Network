Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck has dropped to 33 in the world's best restaurant list

Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck has been skewered as it drops 20 places in the world's top ten restaurants.

The restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, famed for snail porridge and mustard ice cream, has spent most of the past decade in the top five restaurants in the world.

However, the 2013 World's 50 Best Restaurants list - billed as the Oscars of the dining world- ranked it at 33.

Blumenthal's disappointment at the 20 place drop for The Fat Duck will probably have been lessened by a climb up the rankings for his latest venture, Dinner.

The Knightsbridge restaurant that serves historic British food climbed two places to number seven.

Spanish restaurant El Celler de Can Roca, which has featured caramelised olives served on a bonsai tree on its menu, has been named the best in the world.

The family run restaurant in Girona, north east Spain, toppled Denmark's Noma from its position to claim the title after spending two years as runner-up on the list.

The Roca brothers' avant-garde eatery  now heads a top-ten lineup dominated by Spanish cuisine.

It was a bad day for British restaurants as the two Blumenthal establishments made up just three entries from the UK.

The Ledbury in London, run by Australian Brett Graham, was the only other British entry on the list at 13.

Blumenthal said while he was pleased to see the emergence of new talent, he admitted frustration at the result.

A chef who beat a severe food allergy has had his restaurant named as one of the best in the world.

British-based Mikael Jonsson (pictured) initially trained as a solicitor because his condition made it impractical to follow his dream of opening a restaurant.

The self-taught was unable to cook without injections because of his seafood allergy.

But after starting on a new diet the Swedish-born chef overcame eczema and asthma and opened Hedone, in Chiswick, London in 2011.

Just 14 months later he was awarded a Michelin star - and now his restaurant has been named the 70th best in the world.

The chef told The Times: 'I think there's a point where you are almost part of the furniture.

'It's exciting to see new people coming through. It's frustrating.'

He said the food served at The Fat Duck, formally named as the world's best restaurant, is 70 per cent better now.

Blumenthal added that the restaurant's three Michelin stars was a more important guide to the restaurant's quality.

Positions two and three on this year's list were taken by chef Rene Redzepi's Noma, in Copenhagen, which has famously served moss, lichen and bone marrow, and Massimo Bottura's comparatively low-key Osteria Francescana in Modena, northern Italy.

El Celler de Can Roca, run by the three Roca siblings, is well-known for its free-style cooking and has long been hailed for its combination of Catalan dishes and cutting edge techniques.

With Joan Roca heading up the kitchen and his brothers Jordi and Josep as head pastry chef and head sommelier respectively, it has built up a reputation as one of Spain's most exciting places to eat.

France and America were the two countries with the most restaurants on the list, both notching up six in the top 50.

China also had three entries for the first time.

The
list was drawn from the votes of more than 900 leading figures in the 
industry - including food critics, chefs, restaurateurs and highly 
regarded "gastronomes".

The
World's 50 Best Restaurants Awards, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua
Panna, were presented at the Guildhall in central London.

It was the restaurant that helped propel Heston Blumenthal to culinary stardom.

The Fat Duck was voted the best in in the world in 2005 and the set menu now costs diners £195 per person.

Blumenthal, who has three Michelin 
stars, set the restaurant up with his ex-wife Zanna and the pair turned 
it into a multi-million pound business.

On the back of its success, 
Blumenthal has gone on to become a television star, signing a £1m deal 
with Channel 4, as well as signing a lucrative deal to promote 
supermarket chain Waitrose.

Under his name, the upmarket supermarket have launched some high quality products - including orange-filled Christmas puddings. The desserts were so popular that 18 months ago they were selling for £200 on eBay as stores ran out of them.

With such commercial success, it will raise the question that Heston has taken the eye off the ball at his top restaurant.

Over the years he has become a familiar face on television as his success in the kitchen has propelled him to national fame. He has published books and set up three other restaurants.

With so much on his plate, it's perhaps little surprise the Fat Duck has slipped down the rankings.

Eight years after topping the list of the world’s best eateries, the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, last night plummeted down the league table to 33rd place - down from 13th last year.

The restaurant, famous for serving unusual astronomic dishes such as snail porridge and egg and bacon ice cream was founded in 1995 and has spent ten years in the top 50 list.

However, in 2009 it closed down for two weeks after it suffered from the largest ever recorded norovirus outbreak with over 400 diners falling unwell.

Television sports presenter Jim Rosenthal, who was eating at the restaurant with his wife for her 58th birthday, was among the diners to fall ill.

In November last year, two chefs working at the restaurant were killed when a double-decker bus ploughed into the taxi in which they were travelling during a promotional tour of Hong Kong.
