Atletico Madrid say they have rebuffed an approach from Manchester City for promising defender Jose Maria Gimenez.

The 19-year-old Uruguayan has impressed observers in Spain despite struggling to break the partnership of Joao Miranda and Diego Godin.

Reports say that City have offered £17.5million for Gimenez, who was bought for just £750,000 from Danubio in April 2013, and that the offer was rejected.

Atletico Madrid have revealed they've rejected Manchester City's £17.5million bid for Jose Maria Gimenez

Atletico have revealed they are in debt to the tune of £400m and there are understandable concerns that the club hierarchy will be forced to sell some of their stars to keep the club afloat. 

The team's success on the pitch, plus the sales of Diego Costa and Filipe Luis, helped appease the banks last summer but debts still have to be addressed.

That is creeping around boardrooms in Europe hence interest from Manchester United and others in Godin and Co as they sense deals can be done.

Diego Simeone is key to Atletico's success and the harmony of their squad but he is likely to leave at the end of the season with City, Liverpool and others all linked should they choose to change their current managers.

Midfielder Koke, a long-term target for Barcelona, is tipped to follow his coach, as is Godin, but Gimenez is seen as one of the lesser known gems of Atletico's squad and one City would do well to sign if Vincent Kompany's injury concerns continue.
