She's the poker-faced fashion designer who intrigued and fascinated the world.

And then Victoria Beckham took part in Vogue.com's 73 Questions series where she gave us a flavour of the quick-witted personality her friends know and love.

Posing in an all-white outfit from her collection, Victoria welcomes the Vogue team into her pristine Dover Street store and reveals 73 things about herself, including her favourite drink, best fashion secret and why she never smiles.

And now, a comedian has gone and created a spoof of the former Spice Girl's short film - and it's bound to make even Victoria crack a smile.

Comedian Holly Burn has recreated a spoof version of Victoria Beckham's Vogue 73 questions video

Dressed in a similar outfit to the star - although probably a much cheaper version - actress and writer Holly Burn invites the camera into a corner shop and begins her tongue-in-cheek video.

The video opens with her striding through the corner shop - and she has Victoria's mannerisms down to a T.

She then greets the corner shop owner in the exact same tone of voice as Victoria does in hers.   

In the Vogue video, the first question is: 'What's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?,' to which the 40-year-old responds: 'I check on my kids.'

In her video, however, Holly responds: 'I have a Poptart.'

While Victoria goes on to reveal that she works out at 6am daily, sunset orange is her favourite colour and 12 Years A Slave is the film that makes her cry the most, Holly cites water as her favourite flavour, nik nak crisps as her preferred spice and see-through as her most cherished colour.

Victoria used the Vogue video as a chance to show off her flagship store, pointing out her favourite pieces as she struts through, as well as debuting her new sunglasses range.

Holly, meanwhile, chooses a Gillette shaving foam as her 'favourite item' in the store and showcases the shop's latest cheese offerings.

When asked what superpower she would have, she responds: 'I would like to be able to count again'.

When asked the final question, she simply storms out of the shop without replying.

She made the film with producer and writer, Amy Dallmeyer.

Victoria was the latest in a long line of celebrities to be asked Vogue's 73 Questions. The questions change depending on the celebrity and the location of the shoot is always specific to the person. 

When Sarah Jessica Parker took part in the interview they spoke to her at her New York home while Blake Lively's interview involved making cupcakes as she's a keen baker.  

Victoria, who seems to be floating around her shop in the film, is asked what her worst question to be asked is and says it is, 'Why don't you ever smile'. 

Amused? Victoria even tweeted a link to Holly's video with a smirking emoji 

She then jokes that she's smiling on the inside and the reason she never breaks into a grin is because: 'I feel that I have a responsibility to the fashion community.'

Victoria opened her first store in September having launched her fashion empire in 2008. Since then the business has gone from strength to strength. 

It has previously been reported that following the success of her UK store Victoria has hopes to open stores in America and Japan.
