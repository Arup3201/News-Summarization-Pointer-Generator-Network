First ever: Eric Daniel Hughes saw 11.02 of his Bitcoins, a type of online currency, taken by the federal government in the first ever seizure of its kind

A South Carolina man received a dubious honor in April when his Bitcoins became the first ever seized by the U.S. government.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration seized the 31-year-old Eric Daniel Hughes’ Bitcoins, which are a type of online currency.

It’s believed that the seizure may have been related to shady online drug clearinghouse Silk Road, a site that only accepts Bitcoins as currency.

According to DEA documentation, agents seized 11.02 Bitcoins from Hughes, worth $814.

Though
 the forfeiture notice makes no mention of the online illicit drug 
seller, the Post and Courier reports that speculation regarding the 
involvement of Silk Road has quickly arisen simply because of the 
Bitcoin seizure.

When buzz 
began to spread of the seizure, users of the blog Let's Talk Bitcoin! 
were able to connect the Bitcoin account number listed on the DEA 
document to a transaction made in April on Silk Road of exactly 11.02 
Bitcoins.

‘This is the 
first time something like this has happened with Bitcoin,’ said Adam B. 
Levine, editor of Let’s Talk Bitcoin!, told the Post and Courier. ‘And 
the interesting subtext is: We don't have any idea just how involved the
 DEA is with Bitcoins.’

Consequently,
 neither do Silk Road users know how deeply the so-called ‘eBay of 
drugs’ has been breached, if indeed it has at all, by the federal 
government.

eBay of drugs: Evidence suggests that Hughes' Bitcoins were seized in connection with shadowy internet drug bazaar Silk Road, which only accepts Bitcoins

Chomping at the bitcoin: Bitcoins are a virtual currency that are difficult to track and the fact some were seized by the government led many who follow the novel money to wonder how they did it

Federal 
authorities admit to seizing Hughes’ Bitcoins, however it is unclear how
 they went about actually holding onto the largely anonymous currency 
units.

The Post and Courier reports that the feds have not, however, charged Hughes as of yet.

The
 local authorities are going after him. The Charleston, South Carolina 
police raided Hughes apartment in June and, according to police 
affidavits, found 10 bags of the narcotic Suboxone during the search.

How'd they do that? The digital currency is stored virtually by sites like Bitcoin Wallet. The feds may have used Hughes' own computer to seize his 11.02 Bitcoins or staged an online sting operation

He is also accused of selling other prescription drugs as well as marijuana to police informants.

So how did the DEA confiscate completely digital currency?

According to Levine, the police would have either had to use the same computer Hughes used to make the transaction to take ownership of the currency or they undertook an online sting operation in order to confiscate the coins.

Unstable currently: Those in the know when it comes to Bitcoins seem at a loss as to how Hughes' virtually currency was seized and what it means for the illicit sale of drugs and other items on sites like Silk Road in the future

Either way, this remains one for the record books and likely has Silk Road drug buyers squirming as their so-called Deep Web—a difficult to access layer of the internet invisible to the typical user where Silk Road can be found—may have been penetrated by authorities.

They are no doubt chomping at the bitcoin as they wait to find out.

THE 'EBAY OF DRUGS'

Dubbed by some as the 'eBay of drugs,' Silk Road is an online, peer-to-peer marketplace for every drug imaginable. Instead of money, however, Silk Road buyers and sellers use the hard to track digital currency Bitcoins.

Unlike normal websites, Silk Road cannot be reached via normal routes. A special browser called a Tor browser must be used to access the illicit site.

Sites like Silk Road exist in a sort of hidden internet, just beneath the one most people know and enjoy. It is known as the Deep Web.

Commerce within the shadowy bazaar is tough to track and authorities have been unable to shut it down. However, the seizure of Hughes' bitcoins has some wondering if federal agents are getting closer to successfully infiltrating the site after years of unsuccessful attempts to bring it down.

MONEY IN A DIGITAL AGE

Bitcoins are a type of online currency that can be exchanged for dollars and vice versa.

The main idea behind it is to facilitate cheap, anonymous transactions policed by its community of users.

Much like gold, there are a finite number of Bitcoins - 21 million exist and are predicted to last until 2140.

This number was designated by the inventor (or inventors) of the virtual coinage when it first came about in 2008.

Also like gold, Bitcoins are mined. But instead of digging in the ground, Bitcoins are extracted online via complex algorithms like virtual pickaxes.

The value of Bitcoins fluctuate like gold, too.
