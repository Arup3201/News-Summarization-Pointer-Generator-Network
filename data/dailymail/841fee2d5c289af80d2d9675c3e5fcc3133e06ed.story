Paris Jackson's mother Debbie Rowe, grandmother Katherine and aunt La Toya Jackson rallied around the teenager on Wednesday night following her suicide attempt.

The women were pictured leaving the LA hospital where the 15-year-old is being held on a on a 5585 psychiatric hold, which permits a 72-hour hold for minors.

Both Debbie, 54, and La Toya, 57, appeared incredibly somber after the visit in pictures obtained by TMZ, while Katherine, 83, left in the back seat of a chauffeur-driven car. They all left separately.

Meanwhile, a source told People, 'Paris is doing well, smiling again and can't wait to see her friends.'

There was no sign of Paris' siblings Prince Michael, 16, or Blanket, 13, nor other members of the Jackson clan. (Prince Michael canceled a scheduled appearance on German television on Thursday, following his sister's troubles.)

The women all made public statements about Paris yesterday, with Debbie admitting daughter has had 'a lot going on lately'.

Paris has recently begun developing a relationship with her biological mother, who relinquished her custody rights to Paris and Prince following her divorce from the Bad singer in 1999.

Her grandmother and legal co-guardian Katherine has been very supportive of Paris' decision to reach out Debbie amid her personal turmoil.

The suicide attempt is understood to have come after a dark time and episodes of self-harming.

'Paris has been very, very depressed for a while. She's been throwing fits and tantrums, kicking and screaming and cutting herself,' a source tells People magazine.

'She misses her father greatly,' the source adds. 'She was the center of Michael's world and it's all different now. She says that she is lonely and that she doesn't feel loved.'

The act is considered by many to be a cry for help, with the insider adding: 'Paris is very unhappy and alone. She's living in this place and there's security and uncles and all these hangers-on. And she's alone. That's one of the reasons she reached out to Debbie Rowe â€“ she wants a family, she's missed her dad.'

June 25 will mark the fourth anniversary of Jackson's death.

Katherine
 lawyer said yesterday the teen is 'physically fine', adding: 'Being a 
sensitive 15-year-old is difficult no matter who you are. It is 
especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you.'

La
 Toya added: 'We are grateful and appreciate the overwhelming concern 
for Paris from both the public and the media, but request  privacy at 
this time while our family handles these issues together'

It is understood Paris tried to commit suicide after reportedly being denied the chance to attend a Marilyn Manson gig.

Other reports have alleged Paris 
'flipped out' and screamed at the relative who stopped her seeing the 
goth rocker, and it is claimed she then locked herself in her bedroom at
 her Calabasas, California home and cut her arm before leaving a note 
and ringing a suicide hotline.

Manson has since passed on a message of support via TMZ, saying: 'I hope you feel better. You will be on my guest list anytime you want.'

Conrad Murray also chimed in with a message for Paris - cold comfort considering he is doctor convicted of killing her father.

'I don't know what you're going through, but I'm sure whatever it is it must be difficult,' Murray said in a message from jail obtained by TMZ.

'I don't know if there's anything I can do to solve your pain or help you with your problem but I wanted you to know that I am here for you. I have never been gone.'

He also referenced the title of a Jackson song, You Are Not Alone.

On Thursday it emerged Paris asked for 'emancipation' from her family at one point, according to the US columnist Roger Friedman, who has strong sources close to the Jackson family. Katherine currently shares guardianship of Paris and her siblings with the son of Michaelâ€™s brother, Tito.

The court action would have given Paris control over her own life before legally becoming an adult at 18.

Paris Jackson has amassed more than a million followers on Twitter and uses the social networking site to share videos, selfies and in recent times, confiding about her troubled state of mind. 

But she has also found herself the target of cruel cyber-bullying.Twitter trolls have posted messages including 'Die...lesbian' and 'you're such a bully. That's why your dad is dead.'

Another branded her a 'ugly b****' and took a swipe about her late father, writing: 'your dad touched little boys.'A recent message read: 'You ugly d*** kill yourself.'

Friedman also alleged that Debbie could seek legal custody of her daughter removing her from the Jackson family compound in Calabasas.

During his high-profile but deeply troubled life, the King of Pop was fiercely protective of his children - covering their faces in masks in public outings - but since death in 2009, Paris has become the most visible in the public spotlight.

Paris, who was just 11 when her father died, delivered the most poignant words of the star-studded service when she tentatively took the microphone and said, 'Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine.'

In the years that followed she granted interviews to Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres, appeared in magazine articles and amassed more than a million followers on Twitter.

She has also expressed interest in starting a singing career and has plans to star in a upcoming movie.

But she has struggled in recent times, and on Tuesday she hinted at her state of mind on Twitter, posting, 'I wonder why tears are salty?' followed by lyrics from the Beatles' song 'Yesterday': 'yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away now it looks as though they're here to stay.'

A 20-minute video of the teen applying makeup was posted to YouTube last week. It shows Jackson in what she describes as her bedroom playfully demonstrating how she does her eye makeup. She receives and replies to several texts on her phone while offering cosmetics instruction. She also reveals that she watches the film Tangled three times a week and, as a child, fantasized about marrying a cowboy.

She also makes goofy faces and says, 'I need serious help. I'm crazy!'

Paris
 wrote on Twitter that she doesn't know how the video, in which she 
repeatedly asserts, 'I am so weird,' ended up on YouTube.

'I hope you guys liked it tho and didn't think i'm too crazy,' she wrote. 'i get weird when i'm not around people lol.'

Paris
 and Prince listed as plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by their grandmother
 against concert giant AEG Live LLC, who she claims is responsible for 
her son's death. Katherine Jackson's lawsuit claims AEG failed to 
properly investigate the doctor convicted of causing the singer's death,
 and pushed the superstar to rehearse and perform a planned series of 50
 comeback shows titled 'This Is It.'

Both children are listed as potential witnesses in the case, which is in its sixth week of trial.

Marvin S. Putnam, a defense attorney for AEG Live, said Paris and Prince Jackson were deposed in the case because they are named plaintiffs and may be called to testify. He said Paris Jackson's testimony was not a 'grilling' but urged privacy for her and her family.

'There's a real person involved here,' Putnam said. 'There's a 15-year-old girl and something incredibly tragic has happened that none of us know why and I think it would really be in everyone's best interest and particularly in her best interest if rather than blowing this up into something else, that they were given a little bit of privacy to deal with something that has to be a tragic, tragic moment for all of them.'

'She's 15,' he said. 'Someone should give her a break.'
