A breathtaking mansion built for a sugar magnate has become the most expensive house for sale in Britain at £100million - and even the estate agents’ brochure will set you back £2,000.

Heath Hall was constructed on London’s most exclusive street - The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead - in 1910 for William Park Lyle of the Tate & Lyle family.

It fell into disrepair until property magnate Andreas Panayiotou bought it in 2006 and transformed it into one of the capital’s finest properties.

How much? This stunning mansion on a Hampstead street known as billionaires' row has gone on sale for £100million, making it the most expensive home on the market

Palatial: The property was built for sugar magnate William Park Lyle in 1910, but fell into disrepair in the 1950s while under the ownership of the Bank of China

He spent £40million renovating the mansion and it is now the most expensive house on the open market in the UK.

The stamp duty alone will cost the buyer £7million - enough to buy a magnificent country home in the Cotswolds.

It is so exclusive that potential buyers will have to undergo a vetting process by agents Glentree Estates before paying £2,000 for the glossy brochure.

Eat your heart out: The magnificent three-story house was brought back to its glorious best thanks to a £40million renovation by property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou

Music to the owner's ears: Mr Panayiotou employed a team of 120 tradesmen for the renovation, adding a further 8,000sq/ft to the already substantial 19,000sq/ft

High-class finish: Twelve types of Italian marble and seven types of wood, all prepared in Italy, were used for the bathrooms, according to the estate agents

Fantastic features: The mansion now boasts 14 bedroom suites, six reception rooms, a drawing room, dining room, family room, sun room and snooker room

The property fell into disrepair after the Bank of China took over the three-storey mansion in the 1950s.

Bishops
 Avenue is now known as Billionaires’ Row because of the incredible 
wealth of the residents which include the Saudi Royal Family.

And
 the person who buys Heath Hall will get bragging rights as one of only a
 few people in London with a nine-figure valued home.

Entertainment hub: There is also a library, home cinema, steam room with sauna, fully fitted home gym and wine cellar with climate-controlled temperature

Tranquil: The home, set in 2.5 acres of manicured gardens, is one of the largest private properties in the capital, but comes with a stamp duty fee of £7million

He was ranked 200th in last year's UK Rich List after building 
up a £400million property empire, a remarkable achievement given that he
 suffers from dyslexia.

He learned to memorise words, but 
never did learn to read in the conventional sense, leaving school at 14 
without a single O-level.

But despite his lack of 
qualifications, he went on to achieve stunning business success.

The son
 of Greek-Cypriot immigrants, Mr Panayiotou was raised in London's East 
End.

Labour of love... and money: Heath Hall was bought by property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou (pictured) in 2006 after falling into disrepair and he has spent £40million bringing it back to its glorious best

As a young man working for his 
father, he bought a small property in Islington, converted it into 
flats, and started what would become one of the biggest buy-to-let 
empires in Britain.

In 2007 he sold thousands of flats, focusing instead on building a portfolio of hotels.

Mr Panayiotou lives on a 20-acre 
estate in Epping Forest and owns £40million Gulfstream G450 jet, a 
£12million Mangusta 130 yacht, and two Cessna Citation jets.

The home, set in 2.5-acres of 
manicured gardens, now boasts 14 bedroom suites, six reception rooms, a 
drawing room, dining room, family room, sun room and snooker room.

There is also a library, home cinema, 
steam room with sauna, fully fitted home gym and wine cellar with 
climate controlled temperature.

Twelve types of Italian marble and 
seven types of wood were used for the bathrooms while the snooker room, 
office, bar, library and grand staircase are all clad in Oak.

All of the carpentry and hand-carved marble basins were prepared in Italy before being transported to the property.

And for the security-conscious billionaire likely to buy the property, Heath Hall has been fitted with a panic room.

This vault-like room has its own toilet, basin, control panel and separate telephone wires, which cannot be cut.

The job of selling the mansion belongs to Glentree Estates and its managing director, Trevor Abrahmsohn.

Mr Abrahmsohn has sold 95 per cent of the homes on Bishops Avenue over the past 35-years and regards Heath Hall as one of the road’s finest properties.

He said: 'Heath Hall is one of the largest private homes in the whole of London. It is like a country home in the city, there are private golf courses nearby and the West End it just 15-minutes away.

'It was the super-mansion of its day and the restoration has been carried out lovingly.

'Bishops Avenue is like Beverly Hills, it is one of the world’s best addresses. And Heath Hall is one of the finest houses on the road.'
