Radamel Falcao is ready to boost Manchester United’s firepower by returning from injury against Hull City at Old Trafford on Saturday.

The Colombia striker’s fitness has been in question since he joined United on loan from Monaco in the summer and he has not played for five weeks because of a calf injury.

But manager Louis van Gaal revealed that Falcao is set to return to the squad this weekend, and Marcos Rojo may also be included after recovering from the dislocated shoulder he suffered in the Manchester derby at the start of this month.

‘We have to wait and see in the last training session,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I live day by day at this moment. It’s always difficult to say but we have good news. Maybe Falcao and Rojo come back in the 18, that’s it I think. The rest were already fit.’

Falcao, who will cost in excess of £50million if United sign him permanently in the summer, has made only five appearances so far and scored once. 

Asked if he believes the former Porto and Atletico Madrid striker can rediscover the form that made him one of the most feared strikers in world football, Van Gaal added: ‘I hope so because we have him on loan because of that.

‘Every player in my selection has to fight for his position. I shall always take the best of the players and it has to be suitable for the mix of players. It’s also an obligation of a player that he does that.’

Luke Shaw is set to miss between four and six weeks with ankle ligament damage sustained against Arsenal

Manchester United sit fourth in the Premier League table ahead of the weekend's match

United still have a worrying injury list with Luke Shaw the latest to be ruled out for between four and six weeks with the ankle ligament damage he suffered against Arsenal last weekend. 

Van Gaal also confirmed that he has given Daley Blind a holiday after the midfielder suffered a knee injury playing for Holland earlier this month.

The United boss said: ‘Luke sustained an ankle ligament injury but with no serious complications. He will be out for the next few weeks because of this.

‘I gave Daley Blind a holiday because in the first week it is more or less rest than exercise. He didn’t have so much holiday because of the World Cup. You may remember the Netherlands were there until the end.

‘He will come back on Monday. Then he has to exercise and practise every day because an injured player has to train more than a fit player.’

Daley Blind, who injured his knee on international duty, will report back to United on Monday

Van Gaal was guarded in his optimism that United will end the season in the Champions League places

United’s victory at the Emirates lifted them into fourth place but Van Gaal was guarded in his optimism at seeing his team among the Champions League spots despite the injury problems and a fixture list that has seen them face Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in three of the last four games.

‘I don’t want to mention that (injuries) as a manager because I want to speak about the fit players, but you’re right when you see how our preparation was, how many injuries, and then how heavy our second part of the matches were,’ he added.

‘It was a very big test but after (playing) heavy opponents we are still a force so I’m happy. But we have to be a force at the end of the league, not now. Now is not so important. We have to improve our playing style and beat our opponents more easily.’

Former United skipper Steve Bruce returns to Old Trafford with Hull on Saturday to take charge of his 700th Premier League game as a manager. At the age of 63, Van Gaal knows he is unlikely to reach the same milestone.

‘It says that he is a very good manager I think, but I don’t know, I cannot judge him,’ he said. ‘When you have 700 Premier League matches, I don’t think I will reach that amount.

‘I have seen him playing for Manchester United. He was a very firm and also a leader. Mostly players who are leaders become managers.’
