A mother has claimed she and her five-year-old developmentally disabled daughter were thrown out of a theater as the girl was making giggling and humming noises that she makes when she is happy.

Samantha Torres had taken her daughter Nadia to see Beauty and the Beast at the Providence Performing Arts Center in Providence, Rhode Island on June 2 for the girl's first trip to the theater.

Once the show began, Nadia, who has a chromosome abnormality and is unable to speak, started laughing and giggling, in a sign she was enjoying the show, her mother said.

Complaint: Samantha Torres says she was asked to leave a theater after her developmentally disabled daughter Nadia, pictured, started laughing and humming during a show - a sign that she was happy

Although no one around them was put off by the sounds, staff made her leave, Torres told South Coast Today.

'They did not ask me to leave; they told me I had to leave,' she said.

Scene: Staff at the theater, pictured, said the mother and daughter were offered other seats

But staff at the theater insisted they acted properly and offered the family different seats, rather than telling them to leave.

Marketing Director P.J. Prokop said the theater has a responsibility to ensure everyone can hear the show, but audience members 'were turning around, they were looking, they were also kind of gesturing', she said.

But Torres insisted only the ushers 
were bothered by her daughter. She now wants the art center to carry out
sensitivity training for its ushers.

She is also working with Rhode Island Developmental Disabilities 
Council to help develop a guide on how venues can prepare for 
people with disabilities.

'I think its going to have a happy ending for a lot of people,' she said.

Attorney Christine Griffin, executive director of the Massachusetts Disabilities Law Center, said the incident could have violated the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of public accommodation, as well as exclusion, segregation and unequal treatment.

Learning lesson: She says she wants ushers at the theater to be given sensitivity training

Griffin said the law allows the staff to act only if Nadia was distracting other audience members.

She
said they could ask the upset audience member to move, or if a group is
distracted, the disabled person could be asked to move.
