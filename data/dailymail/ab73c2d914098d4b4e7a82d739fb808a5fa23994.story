Controversial: Illusionist Derren Brown has denied reports that his next trick will be to turn a gay man straight

Television illusionist Derren Brown has denied reports that he will turn a gay man straight and make a straight man attracted to men for his latest stunt.

The controversial star has made headlines by apparently playing Russian roulette live on television, by 'talking to the dead' in a staged live seance, hypnotising ordinary people to rob a security van at gunpoint and convincing a man the world had been taken over by zombies.

But he has said that won't be courting more contention by using mind control to change people's sexuality.

Brown, 41, was quoted in The Sun as saying: 'I was thinking about this the other day — it would be interesting wouldn’t it? To take a gay guy and make him straight and a straight guy and make him gay.'

But he took to Twitter this evening to deny reports that he will use the concept as the basis of his next show.

He tweeted: 'Article in @thesunnewspaper saying that my next show is about changing sexuality: total rubbish.

'Thanks for that, being printed everywhere as fact.'

Whatever his next stunt, Brown, who came out as gay in a newspaper interview in 2008, will be hoping that he will see a repeat of the ratings success of his last television special, Apocalypse.

The show, which saw him convince Steven Brosnan that the world had been hit by a meteor shower and been taken over by zombies, attracted around 2.3million viewers - making it one of the highest rated Channel 4 shows over the past two years.

Brown has never been far from controversy throughout his television career.

He was criticised by police after playing Russian Roulette on Channel 4 watched by more than three million viewers in 2003.

In 2004 his show Seance, where he brought students from Roehampton University together at Eton Hall, east London, for a seance claiming that a dozen people had killed themselves there in a suicide pact in 1974.

Making headlines: Derren Brown has previously played Russian Roulette and performed a seance live on television

The programme received more than 700 complaints, mostly made prior to it airing.

Several complaints were also made to regulatory body Ofcom in 2010 following his television special Derren Brown: Hero at 33,000 Feet.

The complaints surrounded a scene which saw a man restrained by a straitjacket laying on a railway line.

But he said in an interview with Gay Times magazine that making headlines has never been his aim.

'Controversy has never interested me for its own sake. It's always been about doing stuff that feels dramatic,' he said.

The illusionist also told the magazine that he has no intention of marrying his long term partner despite proposed changes in the law to allow same sex couples to wed.
