A Conservative MEP has received a barrage of online abuse after defending Gibraltar against mounting Spanish aggression.

Julie Girling, who represents the Rock in Brussels, has been branded a ‘Nazi’ and ‘too ugly to visit Spain’ on Twitter after speaking out against huge delays at the border.

But the defiant politician insisted she will ‘not be bullied’ into silence.

Target: Conservative MEP Julie Girling said she has been bombarded by online abuse after calling for a boycott of Spanish holiday resorts

Mrs Girling triggered a furious response after suggesting British families boycott Spain when planning their holidays.

Tensions have mounted in recent weeks in a dispute over Spanish fisherman accessing Gibraltar waters, which has seen Madrid impose draconian border checks which have caused huge queues.

The Royal Gibraltar Police said drivers had to queue for around three hours on Tuesday to enter Gibraltar, although there were no delays leaving. Some motorists said they were kept waiting five hours.

Gibraltar's chief minister accused Spain’s prime minister of behaving like Argentine dictator General Galtieri.

Fabian Picardo said Mariano Rajoy was fuelling the crisis to distract from his domestic troubles – just as the military junta in Buenos Aires did by ordering the invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982.

He spoke out as the Foreign Office announced that it is lodging another formal complaint with Spain over the latest ‘unacceptable’ delays at the border with Gibraltar.

Mrs Girling urged British hoilidaymakers to shun Spanish resorts until the dispute was resolved.

Checks: Motorists queue at the border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar in La Linea de la Concepcion. Irate drivers waited up to five hours to enter Gibraltar, some even pushing their cars to save fuel

Delays: Traffic builds up on the Spanish side of the border. The Royal Gibraltar Police said the wait had been around three hours

But she was sent a stream of abuse by online trolls via e-mail and Twitter.

One user called Javier said: ‘You are a nazi Julie Goering.’

Other called her a ‘f****** bitch’ and warned: ‘You're too ugly to visit Spain anyway.

A message posted by someone called 'Fran' said: ‘Why dont u try New Delhi 4 ur next hol.. .. u might get a s*** by some p**** if u r lucky.....Adios.'

Some messages were posted in Spanish while others used poor English.

Mrs Girling said: ‘It may be that to be trolled goes with the job. However, the Spanish Twitter trolls aren't doing their argument any favours by trolling me.

‘Their abuse shows they have no argument as they can only resort to the lowest form of language.

‘The people of Gibraltar need our support. They will not be bullied by the Spanish Government or by a minority of the Spanish people. Neither will I.’

Threat: David Cameron has raised the prospect of taking legal action against Spain for delays at the border

David Cameron is poised to make a decision on whether to sue Spain in the European Court of Justice 
over its imposition of draconian border controls.

A task force, including the aircraft 
carrier Illustrious and two frigates, set sail from Portsmouth on Monday
for a long-planned exercise in the Mediterranean.

The frigate HMS Westminster, which 
left Portsmouth this week is due to dock in Gibraltar between Monday 
and Wednesday next week along with two support vessels.

Pedro Pitarch, a retired 
Spanish general and former head of defence policy, accused the Spanish 
government of taking an ‘overly passive’ stance and called on them to 
prevent the ships docking.
