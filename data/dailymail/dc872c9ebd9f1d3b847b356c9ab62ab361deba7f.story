Former US presidential candidate John McCain has urged the Prime Minister not to invite Russian president Vladimir Putin to November's G20 summit in Brisbane.

The prominent US senator told The Australian on Wednesday from his office in Washington DC that he believed Mr Putin's alleged involvement in July 17's MH17 tragedy - where a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down - should warrant the leader being treated as an 'international pariah'.

When asked if he thought Mr Putin should be allowed to join his counterparts at the G20 summit in Brisbane later this year, Mr McCain replied: 'I certainly don't think so.'

Making his position clear on who he thought caused the deaths of 298 people on-board the doomed flight, Mr McCain said Mr Putin was 'totally responsible'.

This comes after Mr Abbott indicated on Tuesday that it was still too early to consider if Russia should be turned away from the summit.

He said on Monday Russia must show genuine remorse and regret over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight - his strongest hint yet that President Vladimir Putin could be barred from this year's G20.

But Treasurer Joe Hockey said he hoped Russia would still be attending the Brisbane event.

Mr Hockey said no one knew where the fallout from the downing of MH17 was going.

'The Russians have said they will co-operate with all this - let's find out if they are fair dinkum or not,' he told Sky News while he was an official visit to New Zealand.

Mr Hockey also added the decision about Russia's attendance would ultimately be made by G20 members, not just Australia.

Later he clarified his remarks, saying they should not be taken as support for Russia's attendance at the summit.

A spokeswoman for the treasurer told AAP that the Treasurer's position was consistent with the Prime Minister's.

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said Mr Putin would not be welcome at the G20 conference unless he co-operated with a probe into the MH17 disaster.

'If Mr Putin's not prepared to do that, well frankly I believe that Queenslanders don't want him here at the G20,' Mr Newman said on Saturday as flags across the state flew at half-mast to mourn the residents of the state who died in the crash.
