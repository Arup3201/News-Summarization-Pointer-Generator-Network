President Barack Obama told family and friends of the men and women killed in the Washington Navy Yard shooting Sunday that he fears 'there's a creeping resignation' of mass shootings in the US and that these attacks are 'the new normal.'

Mr Obama's remarks came about mid-way through the memorial service, held at a Marine barracks near to the naval base where 12 innocent people were shot dead Sept 16 by crazed gunman Aaron Alexis.

'Sometimes I fear there is a creeping resignation... that this is somehow the new normal,' said Mr Obama, adding 'we can't accept this.'

'Once more, our hearts are broken,' the President said, before lamenting that he's now spoken after five such tragedies while in office.

'We must insist here today - there is nothing normal about innocent men and women being gunned down where they work,' said Mr Obama, before defending the rights of gun owners.

People should be allowed to own guns, said the President, but not at the expense of others' safety.

'I do not accept that we cannot find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions,' said Mr Obama, 'including our basic Second Amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis.'

Admitting that shooting can't be stopped, the President said that should not at least stop the effort to prevent them.

'We cannot stop every act of senseless violence… but if we can prevent even one tragedy like this, we've got an obligation to try,' said Mr Obama.

Additionally, the President remarked that there must not only be a change in how people obtain firearms, but also in the mindset of the Americans.

'The change we need will not come from Washington... it'll come from the American people,' said Mr Obama, 'the tears are not enough.'

Though defiant in the wake of yet another mass shooting, the President admitted that only so much could be done and said that they are likely to occur again.

'Wisdom comes from the recognition that tragedies like this... are not inevitable.'

Sunday's late-afternoon service is being held at the Marine Barracks Washington in southeast Washington, not far from the Navy facility where authorities say 34-year-old Aaron Alexis fatally shot a dozen people last Monday morning. Police killed Alexis in a gun battle.

The dead range in age from 46 to 73, and include civilian employees and contractors. Eight people were also hurt, including a police officer and two others who suffered gunshot wounds.

Obama spokesman Jay Carney says the president wants to mourn the loss of life and share in the nation's pain after another mass shooting.

The service is closed to the public, says barracks spokesman Capt. Jack Norton. About 4,000 people have been invited, he said.

As authorities searched Monday for the gunman, Obama lamented that "we are confronting yet another mass shooting, and today, it happened on a military installation in our nation's capital." He said the gunfire targeted military and civilian personnel, men and women who were going to work and doing their jobs.

Addressing an awards dinner Saturday night in Washington, Obama said these families "now know the same unspeakable grief of families in Newtown, and Aurora, and Tucson, and Chicago, and New Orleans, and all across the country, people whose loved ones were torn from them without headlines sometimes, or public outcry."

But he said that kind of violence is happening every day. He urged supporters "to get back up and go back at it" to push gun control legislation that stalled in the Senate earlier this year, part of a package of measures Obama promised to push after the December killing of 20 first-graders and six educators at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

"As long as there are those who fight to make it as easy as possible for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun, then we've got to work as hard as possible for the sake of our children," Obama said, in a likely preview of his remarks Sunday. "We've got to be ones who are willing to do more work to make it harder."

The Navy Yard itself re-opened for normal operations on Thursday, three days after the shooting. The building where the shooting took place remains closed.

Obama has taken on the role of the nation's chief consoler several times already this year, and many more times throughout his nearly five years in office.

This year, he led the mourning for victims of an explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, and a double bombing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. He also consoled victims of a major tornado that flattened the town of Moore, Okla.

Obama also has mourned victims of other mass shootings, including in Newtown, Conn., and at shopping mall in Tucson, Ariz., that severely wounded then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
