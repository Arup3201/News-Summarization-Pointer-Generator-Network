Swansea City  have revived their interest in Blackburn Rovers striker Rudy Gestede.

Manager Garry Monk has made a striker his priority for the summer and club scouts have checked on Aleksandar Mitrovic at Anderlecht and Obbi Oulare from Club Brugge. 

An offer has been made to Marseille's Andre Ayew also but he remains a target for bigger clubs too. Gestede has scored 20 goals this season and Blackburn value him at £7million.

The striker is rated at £7million by Rovers, as Swansea set their sights on signing a proven hitman

Anderlecht hitman Aleksandar Mitrovic has also caught Swansea's eye and they could move for him too

Club Brugge striker Obbi Oulare has been attracting plenty of interest from the Premier League recently

Crystal Palace, Hull and West Brom have all made enquiries but considered the 6ft 4ins Benin international overpriced.

 Blackburn face a dilemma this summer as they contend with Financial Fairplay restrictions with Middlesbrough, Derby and Nottingham Forest ready to bid for Jordan Rhodes too. 

They want to gain promotion but need to sell to balance the books.

Swansea are also keen to sign a left-back with Leicester's Jeffrey Schlupp among the players being considered.
