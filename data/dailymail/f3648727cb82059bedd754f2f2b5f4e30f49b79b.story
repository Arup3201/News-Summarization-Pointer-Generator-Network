England internationals Sam Burgess and James Graham have been honoured at the 2014 Dally M Awards for their performances in Australia's National Rugby League.

The pair, who swapped the Super League to test themselves down under, have excelled this season, with both named in the team of the year at the NRL's official annual awards.

Burgess, who left Bradford for South Sydney in 2009 but will move to rugby union side Bath in the coming weeks, was named lock forward of the year.

He will also get the chance to bow out of rugby league on a high after helping the Rabbitohs reach the NRL Grand Final for the first time for 43 years.

They will play against Graham's Canterbury side in the final at the ANZ Stadium this Sunday.

Graham joined the Bulldogs from St Helens in 2012 and won the front-rower of the year award on Monday.

The awards are named in honour of former dual-code Australia international Dally Messenger.
