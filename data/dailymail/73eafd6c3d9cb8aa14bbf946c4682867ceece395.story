Like most people who lose a beloved pet, Nicole Green is grieving for her cat Poppy. The playful tabby arrived in Nicole’s life 15 years ago as a lively kitten and soon became a big part of her family.

‘Poppy was always such a boisterous little thing,’ says Nicole, 38, an insurance underwriter from Epping, Essex.

‘She loved being out in the garden and every summer I’d look out of the window and see her flying through the air trying to catch butterflies. Then at night she’d be so loving and would curl up close to me on my bed. That’s the thing I miss most, our snuggle time.’

Nicole, who is married to James, 31, a fireman, and has three children, Macey, 14, Archie, seven, and George, eight weeks, admits that she wells up when she reminisces about her pet.  

But Poppy isn’t dead. She is one of more than 1.3 million British cats and dogs with dementia, which has a devastating effect on their lives — and those of their owners.

‘Every night it takes me two or three hours to try to settle her to sleep because she’s so distressed and doesn’t know where she is,’ says Nicole. ‘She’ll miaow loudly and pace up and down for ages before she sleeps.

‘In the morning I’ll come downstairs and whereas before she used to jump off the table and come purring around my legs, now she simply doesn’t respond. She just stares blankly back at me and it’s obvious she has no idea who I am. It breaks my heart.

‘She never used to have toilet accidents but now it happens most nights. Sometimes when the back door opens she will wander outside and I feel a huge sense of panic because if she gets lost, she won’t be able to find her way home again. She can’t even find her bowl.’

Recent research from the University of Edinburgh found that half of all cats over the age of 15 and a third of those aged 11 to 14 suffer from dementia.

Another study found that 41 per cent of dogs aged 14 and over and 23 per cent of those aged 12 and over also suffer.

Although most studies so far have focused on cats and dogs, owners are reporting behaviour similar to dementia in a variety of animals, including rabbits, guinea pigs and even parrots.

If your pet is eight or older, and you answer yes to one or more of these questions, consult your vet:

Does your pet pace or wander aimlessly, finding it hard to settle?

Does it stare blankly as if unaware of surroundings?

Does it fail to recognise or respond to familiar people such as family and friends?

Does it get lost or confused in the home or garden?

Is it forgetful — for example, forgetting to go to the toilet or repeatedly seeking attention?

Does it vocalise repeatedly or for no reason?

The irony is that the disease is actually a result of domestic animals living beyond their natural life expectancy, as loving owners pay out for expensive food, medication and surgery to keep their pets alive.

‘The main form of dementia in animals is called Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome, which is a degenerative brain disease remarkably similar to Alzheimer’s in humans,’ explains Jon Bowen, Honorary Lecturer in Small Animal Behaviour at the Royal Veterinary College, London.

‘As with humans, areas of the brain stop working properly which leads to problems with learning, memory, sleep patterns, social interaction  and continence.’

Bowen believes that, just as humans are increasingly suffering from dementia due to our rising life expectancy, our pets are being stricken by the disease because they are living longer than ever.

The average dog now lives to the age of 12 and a cat to 14. So, to some extent, animal-loving owners are responsible for the rise in dementia.

‘Years ago we weren’t seeing pets live until 17 or 18 years of age and nowadays we do,’ says Mr Bowen. ‘Their brains aren’t evolved to live so long — they wear out.’

The rise is so sudden that animal insurer Petplan recently revealed claims for vet appointments regarding dementia have increased by 23 per cent for dogs and 48 per cent for cats over the last three years.

Michael Davies, Associate Professor in Small Animal Clinical Practice at the University of Nottingham, says — as with humans — experts are still in the dark as to why some animals are afflicted and not others. ‘Loss of cognitive function with age in dogs and cats is associated with similar structural changes in the brain to people — an accumulation of a protein called amyloid in the brain tissue.

‘The amyloid accumulates within the nerve cells in the brain, altering how it functions.’

Heartache: Nicole says the affect of dementia on your pet, and your life as an owner, can be devastating

Nicole found out that Poppy had dementia
 last December. Vets usually diagnose the condition after hearing about 
the change in the pet’s behaviour, and undertaking a full physical 
examination and a range of tests.

Loving friend: As Poppy is not in pain Nicole and her family plan to make her comfortable until the end

Putting down a pet with serious dementia may be an option, particularly if they are in physical pain or injuring themselves. However, it is not always the kinder option, as senile pets can live perfectly comfortable lives.

‘Some days Poppy doesn’t even remember what she likes eating any more,’ says Nicole.

‘A few weeks ago she left a bowl of her favourite cat food and went into the living room and lapped baked beans off my son’s plate. She never liked them before. She also gets disorientated and walks round and round the garden like she’s trying to get her bearings.

‘Three months ago Poppy managed to squeeze through a gap in the fence and I found her wondering in the grounds of the local hospital looking lost.

‘We were told that there’s no medication we can give her. She’s not in pain so the kindest thing is to make her comfortable at home and spoil her. I’ll be her best friend to the end. She has been a loving friend to me.’ As well as the one million cats with dementia in the UK, there are 300,000 dogs who suffer from the condition, too.

Janice Care’s 12-year-old Airedale terrier, Zoe, was diagnosed a year ago.

‘She was such an energetic and playful little dog,’ says Janice, 45, a housewife who is married to Steve, 48, a furniture manufacturer, and mum to Jade, 21, Rosie, 18 and Freddie, 16. ‘As she got older, she started to sleep more. Then a year ago we noticed her bumping into furniture and getting lost on walks, which was heartbreaking.

‘We took her for a check-up and discovered she’d gone partially deaf and blind in her old age.

‘But something still didn’t add up and six months later Zoe started behaving oddly and barking for no reason.’

Janice, from Ongar, Essex, took Zoe back to the vet, who  diagnosed dementia.

‘We weren’t told about any medication that could help Zoe so we just got on with caring for her ourselves. It helps that we also have Darcie, a three-year-old schnoodle (a cross between a schnauzer and a poodle), and she encourages Zoe to get up and play. She even helps guide her round the house.’

Alison Stratford, 56, a research manager from Bracknell, Berkshire, cares for her mother Glenys, 88, who has Alzheimer’s.

Alison realised her 20-year-old cat Toffee had dementia when he started displaying similar symptoms to her mother.

‘My mother would often eat her dinner, I’d take the plate away, then sit down to eat mine and she’d shout and ask me, “Where’s my dinner?” She thought she hadn’t had it and wanted it again.

‘Toffee would do the same. He’d eat his dinner and instead of curling up and sleeping, he’d go back and stand by his bowl and miaow for it all over again.

‘I volunteer as a welfare officer for Cat Protection and I’m trained in cat health  so my heart sank. I knew it  was dementia.’

Surprisingly, despite the rise in pet dementia, it often goes under-reported by vets. 

Symptoms: Alison recognised Toffee was suffering from dementia because he started displaying similar behavior to Alison's mother, a dementia sufferer

‘We may be detecting only about one in eight cases because signs of dementia just aren’t visible in a consultation,’ says Jon Bowen.

‘We rely on owners to spot the signs and tell us. If you diagnose a senile pet early, you can get in quickly and start treating them sooner with much better results. Just six months can see a pet decline rapidly.’

Some owners say pet dementia can be slowed down using games to exercise and stimulate their animals, although there is no cure.

Gently stroking Poppy, who is now purring softly, Nicole knows only too well the heartache of suddenly ‘losing’ a pet to dementia.

She says: ‘This is something every animal lover should be aware of. The impact on your pet — and your own life — can be devastating.’
