It's been described as the Holy Grail for tea connoisseurs - and a cup will set you back £5.

The pricey brew comes from India's Darjeeling Makaibari Tea Estate and there are only 420 jars of the rare tea on sale in the country.

Moonlight Silver Tip's tea-leaves are harvested between midnight and 3am once every 108 years on a full-moon night in June. And each £50 12g jar makes just ten cups of tea.

A 12g jar of the Moonlight Silver Tips tea costs £50

The high value is due to the small window of opportunity available to pick the leaves, which has to be done at the right celestial moment.

And the weather conditions have to be perfect as well; the night the tea is picked has to be bright and clear.

Mark Nicholls, tea taster at Hampstead Tea in London, where the jars can be purchased, said: 'The rarity of Moonlight Silver Tips is due to the optimum picking conditions occurring once every 108 years.

'This tea was picked during the summer solstice and a full moon, giving this rare planetary configuration. 

'In addition, the tea was picked by moonlight, with the conditions of the night of 13th June, between midnight and 3am, optimal.'

The white tea comes from the world's first biodynamic estate on the oldest tea plantation in Darjeeling.

Biodynamic agriculture is a form of organic farming. 

Described as a holistic understanding of agricultural processes, it treats soil fertility, plant growth and livestock care as as ecologically interrelated tasks, emphasising spiritual and mystical perspectives. 

Moonlight Silver Tips tea has a light pale white sherry depth, with a delicate peachy flavour.

The tea leaves benefit best from being brewed with filtered water.

Yellow Gold Tea Buds

At about £62 for 50 grams (25 cups), the leaves of this Chinese tea are painted with non-toxic 24-carat gold. They are harvested on one day a year with special golden scissors, and only from the top part of the tree.

Panda dung tea

Reportedly costing £127 a cup, this tea from China is not actually made with panda poo but grown in ground that is fertilised by the bear's excrement. Pandas only eat wild bambo, of which 30 per cent is absorbed into their body. The rest of the nutrients are in their waste, which, according to connoisseurs, makes the tea taste of bamboo.

Da Honh Pao 

The half green-half black Da Honh Pao tea is similar to a heavy Darjeeling. The taste is described as rich and floral and lingers in the mouth several minutes after drinking. The £180 a pot tea is served at Royal China Club's restaurants in London.

Gyokuro

A Japanese green tea made from ungrounded leaves also known as Sencha, the leaves are shaded from the sun before they are harvest. 100g of the super-exclusive tea costs £26.

Tieguanyin

This Chinese tea costs £1,900 per kg. The Oolong tea leaf is robust and can be brewed up to seven times before it loses its flavour. The price  is steep because the leaves are kneaded before being put into cloth bags so  they make a pitch-perfect sound when they are poured into the cup.
