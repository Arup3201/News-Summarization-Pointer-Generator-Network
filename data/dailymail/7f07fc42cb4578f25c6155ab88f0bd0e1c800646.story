The Notebook is well-known as one of the most romantic films of all time.

So it’s about time that a wannabe groom decided to pop the question using inspiration from the famous movie.

Italian Angelo  – with a little help from a proposal planner – hired a private lake in Alexandra Palace, north London, and filled it with 1000 origami swans to propose to his girlfriend, Chiara. 

A little help from his friends: Angleo asked his friends and family to help out with the proposal and they stood alongside the lake

Inspired: Angelo's proposal was inspired by the famous scene in the Notebook where Noah (Ryan Gosling) rows Allie (Rachel McAdams) out onto the lake outside of his house

The gesture was a reference to the famous scene in the Hollywood movie where Noah, played by Ryan Gosling, took his love Allie, played by Rachel McAdams, on a boat ride to a beautiful lake that was filled with swans.

The whole moment was captured on camera by Tiffany Wright - the woman who helped Angelo plan his proposal. 

Tiffany was also on hand to row into the lake and help release the origami swans into the water. 

Although the effect wasn't quite as spectacular as the blockbuster movie, from the look on Chiara's face she certainly appreciated the gesture. 

Angelo then asked his friends and family to hold up signs which contained the worlds, 'Chiara, Will You Marry Me? You are the one.'

During the video, Chiara is also seen being serenaded by a singer - the woman sings the Italian's favourite songs as she walks alongside them on the banks of the lake.

Tiffany - who now runs romance company The One Romance but previously set up the UK's first proposal planning company - then delivers the couple some pink cocktails.

She told FEMAIL that planning the proposal with Angelo, who now lives in West London with  Chiara, was challenging given that she only had a week's notice.

'I helped Angelo plan his proposal to Chiara after he got in touch with just one week’s notice,' she said.

‘He had no idea how he wanted to propose so I had a long phone conversation with him and discovered that she loved the movie "The Notebook.’

The special moment: Angelo had the ring with him in the boat the whole time waiting to propose to Chiara

Surprise: At they rowed around the lake Chiara began to notice the paper swans floating around in the water

Tiffany continued: 'With just seven days to plan, we were really up against it time wise. 

'Plus, the proposal involved securing a private boating lake in London which is not an easy task!

‘We got a singer to sing her favourite songs and made 1000 origami swans out of paper that we floated onto the lake as they rowed around.

'Angelo also wanted his family and friends included, so we had to keep them hidden in the bushes until the right moment!’

The special moment was filmed for the TV show The Proposers, which aired on Lifetime. 

And luckily all of Angelo's planning was not in vain. 

During the proposal, he tells Chiara: 'When we are together, everything is possible. Together everything is doable.

'I did this because when I met you, one year ago more or less, my life changed.'

He then presented her with a diamond ring and she accepted his proposal. 

The video was made for the TV series last year and Angelo and Chiara are now happily married.
