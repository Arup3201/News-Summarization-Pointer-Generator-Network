Facebook is facing another backlash from users and privacy campaigners after announcing it is once again changing its privacy settings.

Up until now Facebook let people hide their profiles in search results using the 'Who can look up your timeline by name?' setting, but the social networking site is retiring this feature with almost immediate effect.

The option was removed from the accounts
 of people who hadn't enabled it last year, and Facebook has 
announced it is removing the feature from everyone else's accounts starting 
from now.

Facebook began removing the 'Who can look up your timeline by name?' feature on accounts which weren't using it last year, but is now retiring it completely. This means users can no longer remove themselves for search results on the site when people who aren't their friends try to find them

Users who still have the old setting will soon see a notice on their homepage warning them the feature is being removed. 

The best way for users to control 
what people can find about them is to choose an 'audience' for each of 
the individual things that are shared. 

In the coming weeks, people who share
 posts publicly on Facebook will also see a notice reminding them those 
posts can be seen by anyone, including people they may not know.

They 
will also be given guidance on how to change the audience for each 
post. 

To quickly control who can find previous posts, users can go to Privacy Settings page and click 'Limit the audience of posts you’ve shared in the past'.

This means any posts that were previously shared with Friends of Friends
 or Public will now be shared just to Friends.

Sean Walsh, head of social media and content for Blue Claw told MailOnline: 'In a world where privacy is significant 
issue for many users, this is a massive step backwards for 
Facebook and may contribute to even more users quitting the site.'

Twitter user RisaJoyyy tweeted: 'Just realised @facebook changed privacy settings so anyone can message me. I'm so annoyed with their lack of concern for user privacy/safety.

While Nygenxer added the changes highlighted 'yet another privacy setting lost; good news for stalkers. Don't. Use. Facebook.'

The 'Who can look up your Timeline by
 name?' feature was applied when people searched for someone's profile 
using Facebook's search bar.

Depending on the setting chosen, the 
profile was either completely hidden from everyone who wasn't already a 
Facebook friend; could only be seen by friends of friends or was only 
visible to certain groups or networks of people.

According to Facebook's chief privacy
 officer, Michael Richter: 'The setting was created when Facebook was a 
simple directory of profiles and it was very limited.

'It didn’t prevent people from 
navigating to your Timeline by clicking your name in a story in News 
Feed, or from a mutual friend’s Timeline.'

He added that following the launch of
 Facebook's Graph Search last year, which lets people find more specific
 details about site members, it's important for users to be able to 
control the privacy of the information shared, rather than how people 
get to their timeline.

According to Facebook's chief privacy officer, Michael Richter, the setting was created when Facebook was a simple directory of profiles. Following the launch of Facebook's Graph Search last year, pictured, the site now wants users to take control over the individual pieces of personal data they share, not just their overall profile

With Graph Search, people can now search for 'users that like rock music in Seattle', for example, or 'vegetarians in Swansea.'

Facebook
 ultimately wants people to take greater control over the individual 
pieces of personal data they share on the site, not just the overall 
profile.

According to Walsh: 'The launch of Graph Search Facebook is no longer content with being 'just a social network' and wants to rival the likes of Google and Bing in the search 
market.

'The difference for Facebook is that whilst Google and Bing have a
 plethora of website data, Facebook has the majority of real-use 
information.

'It knows where you went on holiday, who your past 
relationships were with, even what brands and TV shows you like. By making this 
data more accessible and removing privacy barriers, Facebook can make 
Graph Search more attractive to potential advertisers.'

Nick McAleenan, a media law expert from JMW Solicitors continued: 'Facebook is clearly trying to close a privacy loophole as people are increasingly aware of their privacy rights. However, the trend we are seeing is actually for people to share more and more info about themselves - Twitter being perhaps the best example of this.'

Jim Brock, ‎vice president of privacy products at AVG Technologies told MailOnline: 'Keeping up with Facebook's constantly changing privacy framework and policies is beyond most people.

'Facebook's business objective is to make information as widely available as possible for commercial purposes, which for many people conflicts with the desire to share mostly with only close family and friends.

'Facebook clings to the myth that they aren't changing the privacy framework when they make our profiles and activity more easily searched and indexed. The fact is, Facebook's default rules make my profile available to more than a billion other people, so when they make it easier to find and search, they are changing the balance of privacy and people should understand this.'
