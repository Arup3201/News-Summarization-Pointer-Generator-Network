A two-year-old boy was found alone and shaking in an apartment two days after his father shot his mother and grandmother dead then turned the gun on himself in a double murder-suicide.

Jacob Knauf was wearing an old diaper and 'smelled of bodies' when relatives came to check on the family on January 4.

The bodies of his parents Bianca and Daniel, as well as Daniel's mother Sally, were found lifeless with gunshot wounds in the property in Palm Springs, California.

Third victim: He also shot his New York-based mother Sally before turning the gun on himself, police say

Police believe discharged US Marine Daniel Knauf, 27, shot his 23-year-old wife and his mother before killing himself at least two days before the bodies were found.

'[Jacob's] hands were shaking, he had blisters around him because his diaper wasn't changed for a couple of days,' Bianca's older sister Diana Benitez told KESQ.

'He thinks his mom's asleep,' she added.

Daniel joined the Marine Corps in 2008 and was discharged in 2009, military records show.  

His recent purchase of guns had sparked argument in the family, relatives told police.

Unaware: Relatives say Jacob, pictured in his father's US Marines cap, thinks his mom is just sleeping

Bianca's mother Lourdes Benitez told KESQ: 'I would tell my daughter I don't like that. And that's how we ended up here.'

Their last contact with Bianca was on New Year's Eve.

They believe Daniel unleashed his attack on the morning of New Year's Day, when his mother, a special needs teacher at School 41, traveled from Rochester, New York, to visit.

'She boasted about seeing the grandchild and being so happy that she was now able to spend time with her grandson,' School 41 Principal Marion Whitfield said on Tuesday. 

After four days with no reply to texts or phone calls, Bianca's parents went to visit the family.

Desperate state: Jacob was covered in blisters when his family finally found him as his diaper hadn't changed

Dispute: Bianca's mother said the family had been arguing over Daniel's recent purchase of guns 

Nobody answered the door so they peered in a window and spotted Jacob sleeping.

Tapping on the window they woke him up and told him to open the door.

'I went outside and I just burst into tears in my car,' Diana told the station.

preparing for the funeral, the Benitez family is keen to express they do not hold a grudge against Daniel.

'Our focus is on Jacob,' Diana said.

Police are still investigating a possible motive for the crime. 

Rescue: Jacob's maternal grandparents (pictured) came to check on the family after four days without contact

Discovered: No one answered the door but they saw Jacob asleep through a window and he let them in
