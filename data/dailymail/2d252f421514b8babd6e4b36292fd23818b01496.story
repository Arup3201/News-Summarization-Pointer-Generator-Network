Body dysmorphic disorder is caused by ‘bad wiring’ in the brain, according to new research.

Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles have discovered that people with the psychiatric disorder have abnormal network wiring patterns across their entire brain.

They also possess abnormal connections between regions of the brain involved in visual and emotional processing.

Body dysmorphic disorder is characterised by an obsession with bodily flaws, and researchers think brain abnormalities may be to blame

This is thought to explain why they perceive themselves as disfigured and ugly, even though they look normal to others.

‘We found a strong [link] between low efficiency of connections across the whole brain and the severity of body dysmorphic disorder,’ Dr Jamie Feusner said.

‘The less efficient the patients' brain connections, the worse the symptoms, particularly for compulsive behaviours, such as checking mirrors,’ he added.

People suffering from the condition tend to fixate on minutest details, such as a single blemish on their face, rather than viewing themselves in their entirety. 

Patients can become so distressed with their appearance that they are unable to lead normal lives.

The condition is thought to affect over 120,000 British people.

In the study, Dr Feusner and his colleagues performed brain scans on 14 adults diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and on 16 healthy adults.

BDD is an anxiety disorder related to a person's physical appearance.

Sufferers spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and have a distorted view of how they look.

It is thought to affect over 120,000 people in the UK.

It is more common in those with a history of depression and is often teamed with  OCD, generalised anxiety disorder or an eating disorder such as anorexia.

The cause of BDD is not clear, but it may be genetic or caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, such as this new study suggests.

Treatment usually involves a combination of antidepressants and talking therapy.

The goal of the study was to map the brain's connections and examine how the white matter networks are organised.

To do this, they used a sensitive form of brain imaging that can measure the quality of the brain's white matter.

From these scans, they were able to create whole brain ‘maps’ .

Next, they used advanced technology to characterise the patterns of connections throughout the brains of people with BDD and then compared them with those of the healthy people.

The researchers found that those with BDD had abnormally high network ‘clustering’ across the entire brain.

This suggests that sufferers may not process information correctly.

The researchers also discovered specific abnormal connections between areas involved in processing visual input - what they see -  and those involved in recognising emotions.

‘How their brain regions are connected in order to communicate about what they see and how they feel is disturbed,’ explained Dr Feusner.

Another recent study has suggested eating disorders such as anorexia are linked to brain function

‘This could affect how they perceive their physical appearance and may also result in them getting caught up in the details of other thoughts and cognitive processes.’

The news comes after another study revealed that people with anorexia have a ‘connection error’ in their brain which makes them think they are overweight when they are not.

Researchers at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany studied the brain regions that become active when people see pictures of bodies.

They asked ten anorexic and 15 healthy women of a similar age to judge which of several different silhouettes corresponded best to their own body shape.

Ten control subjects who did not participate in the MRI scan answered the same question by matching a photo of the test subject to the right silhouette.

Scientists found that while healthy subjects rated themselves as thinner than the control subjects, those with the eating disorder perceived themselves to be fatter than the control subjects did.

The team then recorded the brain activity of the 25 participants using MRI scanners, while they observed photos of bodies.

They analysed the activity in the 'fusiform body area' and the 'extrastriate body area' in the left hemisphere of the brain.

Previous studies have shown that these regions are critical for how people process images of bodies.

They found the connection between the two regions, which process body images, was weaker among anorexic women than in healthy women.

The more prominent this 'connection error' was, the more overweight the respondents considered themselves to be.
