A pregnant woman was gunned down just moments away from her Queens apartment building Wednesday, ending both her life and that of her unborn child. 

Anastasia Massey, 27, was reportedly on the way to her home at the Horace Harding Expressway building in LeFrak City at the time of the shooting, having just taken her three children to school at 8:30 a.m. that morning.

That's when an unidentified gunman shot the six-months-pregnant Massey in the arm and chest.

The Daily News reports that a neighbor's daughter started to scream as the shots echoed through the neighborhood.

'It was like a big loud boom,' an anonymous witness said. 'I thought something happened to the building. I was upset thinking that the building was falling down.' 

Though Massey was taken to Elmhurst Hospital as soon as possible, she succumbed to the gunshot wounds.

Her baby, which doctors were able to save before she passed away, remained in critical condition until following her mother shortly after 11:30 p.m. 

Her husband was sleeping in the building when Massey was shot, and found her body on the floor of the hallway outside their door after he heard the gunfire.

Her unborn baby, which doctors were able to save before she passed away, remained in critical condition until following her mother shortly after 11:30 p.m.

She was still breathing but could not speak. 

'She was out,' said a security guard.

Police are still investigating but the shooter remains at large. 

Her uncle is being sought for an interview after being named in a domestic incident. 

But neighbors say the area has attracted enough criminals that violent incidents are a matter of course.

'What has happened is there a lot of people now lingering in the basement and the first floor,' neighbor Wendy Bruno told reporters. 'The police come they can see them coming and run to another floor. And there are no cameras on the floors.'
