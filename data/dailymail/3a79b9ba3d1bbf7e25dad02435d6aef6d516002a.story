From Givenchy to Chanel, Kim Kardashian showcased some envy-inducing outfits in 2014.

While she has the most esteemed designers on speed dial and finally won plaudits in the fashion world - even landing a Vogue cover - the reality TV star has revealed that she's having a style overhaul for the coming year.

Writing on her Twitter, the mother-of-one said: 'Up all night redoing my whole wardrobe with Kanye.....I'm so ready for new looks for the New Year! New 2015 vision.'

Kim Kardashian, who has recently made a name for herself in the high fashion world, has revealed that she's having a style overhaul for the coming year with the help of husband Kanye West

As she signalled the end of a stylish year, the 34-year-old made sure to credit her favourite outfit of the year.

'This Givenchy look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014,' she captioned a photo of herself wearing the black lace dress and leather jacket at Paris Fashion Week.

Of course, her new husband Kanye has played a large part in her style transformation. 

Kim has spoken on many occasions about the rapper-come-designer's influence on her wardrobe choices.

Last year, Kanye introduced his wife to fashion label A.W.A.K.E. - and she loved it so much she wore it twice in four days.

Writing on her Twitter, the mother-of-one explained: 'Up all night redoing my whole wardrobe with Kanye.... I'm so ready for new looks for the New Year! New 2015 vision'

The brand, which is actually run by Russian designer and Harper's Bazaar former fashion director, Natalia Alaverdian, was discovered online by Kim's husband, Mr West.

'He researches everything and he loves to find new talent, and he introduced me to her and told me she’s part Armenian, and so am I,' Kim told WWD.

'I’m all about empowering other women to be successful and it’s really important to me to support designers that I believe in and friends that I believe in that are hardworking.' 

In one episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kanye is even seen clearing out her closet to make way for a sleeker look. 

And it seemed his help worked - just less than a year after the ELLE shoot and Kim, who was heavily pregnant with North at the time, showed the first signs of being ingratiated into the fashion world.

She was asked by Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue, to cover her CR Fashion book.

Kim was photographed for the cover picture by Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld and the shoot was art directed by Ricardo Tisci.

It was a controversial choice at the time, but that worked in Kim's favour, as Carine later explained to Time Out.

She said: 'She’s controversial, but so was Marilyn Monroe and I always like controversial people.'

She went on to praise the reality star, saying: 'She was brave...with Karl Lagerfeld shooting.

'She had one guy for hair, one guy for make-up – no extensions or lashes – and for her it must have been like being naked, and she accepted everything.

'I don’t think normally she would wear those sort of clothes – I’ve never seen her in a Comme des Garcons jumpsuit or a basketball jacket, but she said yes to everything.

Pals with Paris: Before she found global fame, Kim worked as Paris Hilton's stylist and personal shopper. She also worked with Lindsay Lohan

'She was the easiest model we’ve had. And when we put a mask on her face, she didn’t say anything.'

It was following North's birth in 2013 that it became clear just how popular Kim was becoming with the world's biggest fashion houses though, from the flood of designers that sent clothes for her new arrival, all duly documented on Kim's Instagram page. 

From Givenchy to Celine and Maison Martin Margiela to Alexander Wang, Kim shared photographs of North's adorable new wardrobe, signaling to the world that the fashion supremos were finally beginning to accept her. 

The biggest coup came in April 2014 though, when she and Kanye landed a joint Vogue cover ahead of their May wedding.

The news caused outrage among some of the magazine's subscribers, but the edition went on to be one of the biggest sellers of the year. 

That magazine sold 500,000 copies, beating both Beyonce and Michelle Obama's Vogue covers.  

Not her best: Kim was never known for her fashion choices and her previous wardrobe contained a number of garish outfits like the gold cocktail dress she wore at the Spike TV awards in 2008, left, and, right, in 2010 at the Lorraine Schwartz jewellery launch 

Anna Wintour said of the cover: 'Part of the pleasure of editing Vogue, one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine, is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it.

'I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T.

'As for the cover, my opinion is that it is both charming and touching, and it was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it; you may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on Vogue's cover.

'He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn't true.'

Since then, Kim has sat from row (with North in tow) at some of the biggest shows at fashion week. 

She also became part of Olivier Rousteng's Balmain army, later posing as a model for him.

Kim now counts designers like Lagerfeld and Valentino as friends and is regularly pictured on nights out with supermodels like Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne. 

Kim is most certainly starting the New Year off in style after being announced as the face of the new issue of fashion bible LOVE magazine, complete with edgy bleached brows.

This undoubtedly signaled the end of her transformation from super eek to super chic.

The metamorphosis has been no mean feat, for while she might now be a firm  favourite with designers, Kim's initial foray into the fashion world was much more humble - as a stylist for none other than Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan.

In fact, a pre-fame, Kim also worked as a personal shopper and she would regularly be dispatched to pick out new outfits for the the heiress and troubled film star.  

It wasn't just her lack of A-list quality that forced Kim into the fashion doldrums though, despite her day job, back in the mid-noughties, her personal style left a lot to be desired. 

To say Kim has become a darling in the fashion world would be somewhat of an understatement - in recent fashion weeks, like here wearing Maison Martin Margiela, she has been front row in Paris, New York, London and Milan

From bright gold dresses to garish satin, she rarely made a 'best-dressed' list in the early part of her career.    

But fast forward nearly ten years and it's a completely different story. 

To say Kim has become a darling in the fashion world would be somewhat of an understatement - in recent fashion weeks she has been front row in Paris, New York, London and Milan.  

It hasn't been an easy transition though,  for a long time Kim was shunned by the designers who now adore her.

Just over two years ago, during a photoshoot for ELLE magazine at the end of 2012, many designers refused to lend their clothes to the reality star. 

Nicola Formichetti, artistic director at Diesel, styled the shoot and revealed at the time that calling in high-end samples was a 'challenge.'

He said: 'People wouldn’t lend me the clothes. But that’s fashion snobbery.'

Nicola, who is now good friends with Kim, revealed that the top designers didn't want their designs featured on a woman who had, 'less-than-model-like-proportions.'

However, he rightfully predicted at the time, 'She's not the It Girl yet, but she will be.'

It truly seems Formichetti's prediction has come true... Kim has become the ultimate fashion IT girl.
