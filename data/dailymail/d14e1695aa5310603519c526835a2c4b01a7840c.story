This is the dramatic moment an adventurous dog was rescued by firefighters after falling 65 feet down a well.

Black Labrador Deegan slipped into the deep hole during an early morning walk in picturesque Wigmore in Herefordshire on December 20.

A total of 19 firefighters attended the scene and, after a two hour rescue operation, found a distressed but uninjured Deegan stuck on a ledge just metres above a deep pool of water.

Freedom: Black Labrador Deegan slipped 65 feet down the well during a morning walk on December 20. He was eventually winched to safety in a two hour rescue operation involving 19 firefighters

Deegan was winched to safety after a firefighter was lowered into the narrow well attached to a specialist harness.

Incredibly, the lucky Labrador escaped with just a few cuts and didnâ€™t require any medical treatment.

Three crews from Herefordshire Fire & Rescue Service took part in the dramatic rescue.

The well Deegan slipped into (left) was covered in foliage and over 65 metres deep. Firefighter Jamie Skipworth was lowered into the hole (right) to bring the distressed dog to safety

Nick Browning, watch commander at Malvern
 fire station, said they had to use their additional line and water 
rescue skills in order to reach the stranded dog.

Mr Browning added: 'On arrival at the incident just outside the village of Wigmore, the line team made contact with the distraught owner and attending crews from Leintwardine and Bromyard, who had managed the safety of the scene.'

'Following an assessment of the incident, firefighter Jamie Skipworth was lowered into the well down the 65 foot to the location where the Labrador, Deegan, had come to rest on a small ledge above the water.'

Deegan was found well out of sight on a ledge 65 feet down the hole. He was only located when his franctic owner heard him barking

Mr Browning went on: 'Firefighter Skipworth secured Deegan in a specialist harness before both were hauled to the surface and safety.'

'Apart from a few cuts, a very wet and cold Labrador was returned safely to an extremely grateful owner.'
