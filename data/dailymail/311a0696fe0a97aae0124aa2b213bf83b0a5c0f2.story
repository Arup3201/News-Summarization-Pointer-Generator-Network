Alan Pardew and Neil Warnock have a bit of history when it comes to touchline tantrums.

The pair had a brief falling-out when Pardew was in charge of West Ham and Warnock at Sheffield United.

Pardew, of course, was at the centre of two unsavoury incidents last season, the headbutt on Hull’s David Meyler and expletive-laden abuse of Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini.

But while Warnock may be emotionally charged on his return to the dugout with Crystal Palace at St James’ Park on Saturday afternoon, his opposite number will be using his eyes and not his brow to win any sideline dispute.

‘I’m a changed man this year,’ said Pardew. 

‘He gets emotional but I’ve never really had a problem with Neil. I think once at Sheffield United we might have had a bit of an issue, but it didn’t take me long to give him the death stare and he backed off. He knows my death stare is better than his.’

He added: ‘I think it’s important that I’ve shown (change) since the incident (headbutt). 

'I limit my time on the sidelines because I am passionate and I want to win the game. I’m not going to change that, but I will try to keep it under wraps to a degree.’
