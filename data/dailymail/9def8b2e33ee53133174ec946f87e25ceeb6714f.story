A Florida woman who was savagely attacked by a bear in April has hit out at her neighbor, who was reportedly feeding the animals.

Victim Terri Frana, 44, of Lake Mary, described neighbor Eugene Cliffers as a 'whack-a-doo' to authorities in a witness statement obtained by the Orlando Sentinel.

Clifers, 63, was charged with a misdemeanor for feeding neighborhood bears.

Frana required serious medical 
attention and multiple stitches after she ran into five bears outside 
her Lake Mary home on April 12.

'He hand-feeds them,' Frana said, according to BayNews9. 'He has them come right up to his patio, his porch. He has pictures of him and his wife hand-feeding the bears, petting the bears.'

'He showed me the pictures. I was disgusted. You know, I try not to engage with him,' Frana said, according to the affiliate station.

Other witnesses claimed in statements obtained by the Sentinel that Clifers had individually named the bears. Authorities said Clifers and his wife are allegedly both featured in bear feeding videos.

As part of the investigation, authorities released what they claim are photo and video evidence of Clifers feeding bears.

Frana, told NBC's Today show that the frightening encounter has left her very shaken.

'I can't close my eyes and not think about it, see it, feel it, but that will go away in time and I'm here,’ said Frana.

'I'm here for my kids.'

Frana said she stepped outside to get her children, who had been playing on their bikes when she was charged by the bears.

'I saw this large bear charging at me,’ she said to the Today show.

'She opened her jaw and clamped down onto my head, and I could just hear her teeth marks going through my scalp.'

Frana revealed she could only think about her family during the bloody attack.

'I said, ‘Please, my kids need me,' she recalled.

Amazingly, Frana managed to escape the attack and drag herself inside her home where she was found by her eldest son, Drew, 15, who called 911, the Today show reported.

Despite living in the neighborhood for 10 years, Frana told the program she felt she and her family became complacent about the threat posed by black bears.

'Unfortunately, we just got too comfortable with them being around,’ she said.

Frana's husband, Frank, said that he was just lucky to still have his wife with him after the attack.

'One of the bears stood up, knocked her 
down and started to maul her,' Frank Frana told tMyFoxOrlando.com. 'The bear actually had my wife's head in its mouth and started to drag 
her towards the woods.'
