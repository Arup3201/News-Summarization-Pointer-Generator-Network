A farmer has claimed he has found the remains of a two Chupacabra creatures also known as blood sucking monsters after stumbling across bizarre-looking dead animals in Chile.

Goat farmer Javier Prohens was having lunch with friends when terrified farmhand 54-year-old Bricio Saldivar alerted them to the bodies of the strange creatures on the outskirts of the small town of Monte Patria in the east central Chilean province Limari.

At first the group thought the remains were those of bats but on closer inspection, they became convinced they are from they mythical creatures.

The remains found by goat farmer Javier Prohens, who believes they could be the bones of a Chupacabra, a mythical blood sucking creature 

Mr Prohens, 54, said: 'He was clearly scared and said he had been up at the old winery and found two strange bodies.

'When we got there we saw them lying among some hay bales in one of the cellars.

'At first we thought they might be bats, but when we looked closer, we realised they had to be something else as the heads were too big for bats.

'And then someone said they looked like Chupacabras.'

Translated into Spanish as 'goat sucker' Chupacabras are reptile-like mythical creatures with leathery and scaly green-grey skin with sharp pins and quills running down its back.

They are said to be four foot tall and hop like a kangaroo, while living in Central and South American countries.

The name comes from the monster's habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats.

Local children crowd around the remains found by the goat farmer. The discovery has worried other farmers in the area who are concerned about the safety of their livestock 

And now the find has sparked fears among other farmers in the nearby area.

Querubin Lebron, 38, said: 'Our livelihoods are built on goat farming. There are lots of goats here.

'Although it's said they only attack animals, who knows it is won't attack our children too.'

In April last year, a couple from Texas claimed they had captured a Chupacabra in their back garden.

However, after an investigation, it was established that the creature was a raccoon suffering from scabies.
