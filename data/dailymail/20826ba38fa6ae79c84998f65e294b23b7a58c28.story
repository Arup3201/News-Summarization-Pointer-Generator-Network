An experienced climber and his two young children were attempting a world record climb on Mont Blanc last month when they were nearly killed by a dangerous avalanche.

Patrick Sweeney and daughter Shannon,11, and son P.J., 9, were climbing an area of Western Europe's tallest mountain named 'the corridor of death' when the fast moving snow caused the kids to start sliding down the mountain.

Video footage of the avalanche shows both children tethered to their father, who quickly anchors himself into the mountain so they aren't swept away.

Moment of terror: Father Patrick Sweeney, anchored his ax into the snow when he heard his children scream

Not hurt: Thanks to their dad's quick thinking, both children survived the avalanche without injury

Survivors: Patrick Sweeney (right) and his two kids (P.J., left, Shannon, center) recalled the climbing incident in an interview with Good Morning America

'I heard P.J. scream first, and then Shannon scream and all I could think of was I have to bury my ice ax and I have to create a good anchor,' Patrick Sweeney told Good Morning America.

'I was sort of stuck because Shannon and I were on each other, so it was hard to get up at first,' P.J. added.

The father and his two children were attempting to set a world record with their climb of the mountain nicknamed 'the White Killer'.

Had they made it to the top, P.J. would have become the youngest person to summit Mont Blanc, a record currently held by Briton Asher Silver who climbed the mountain at age 10 in 2009. 

Despite the fact that no one was injured in the avalanche, Sweeney and his two kids decided to be safe and descent the mountain.

While P.J. is anxious to attempt another climb, Shannon says she wants to wait another year before trying again.
