Wives - or husbands - of fans of 
online 'world' games such as World of Warcraft find that the games cause
arguments, as well as eating into time couples might spend together.

But
there is hope for husbands hooked on online games such as Warcraft and 
Star Wars: The Old Republic - if you can just persuade your other half 
to join in, all will be well.

Around
75 per cent of spouses said that they wished their husbands would put 
less effort into levelling up their character, and more into their 
marriage, according to a Brigham Young University study of 349 couples 
with at least one online gamer.

Perhaps surprisingly, 36 per cent of online gamers are married.

The research found that 76 per cent of couples where both people played found that gaming was a positive influence.
