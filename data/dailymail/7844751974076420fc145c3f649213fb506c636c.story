An Indian news network ran a blank screen for an hour in protest over a government decision to ban a documentary about the savage gang-rape of a Delhi student.

NDTV broadcast the static image - showing just a flickering candle and the words 'India's Daughter' - between 9pm and 10pm on Sunday. 

It was due to have shown the documentary, about a physiotherapy student who died after being savagely attacked and raped on a bus, to coincide with International Women's Day.

But just days before its broadcast India obtained a court order banning the film on the grounds it risked fuelling public anger.

The documentary included a chilling interview with Mukesh Singh, one of five men convicted over the 2012 attack in New Delhi, who said: 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy.' 

Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the comments in which Singh blamed the 23-year-old victim were 'highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women'.

The channel has made no public comment, but its editorial director Sonia Singh tweeted ahead of the screening: 'We won't shout but we will be heard.'

The ban triggered a storm of protests in India and many people welcomed NDTV's move. 

Rifat Jawaid tweeted: 'Well done NDTV for deciding to go off air for one hour... Very innovative and powerful.'

Tushar Gandhi, the great grandson of India's independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, added: 'Wish I could post a blank tweet in solidarity with NDTV's protest.' 

India's Daughter, by award-winning British filmmaker Leslee Udwin, was due to be shown in seven countries including India and Britain on Sunday.

The BBC brought forward its showing of the film to Wednesday after India announced its ban, citing intense public interest.

The father of the victim has said everyone should watch the documentary, which showed 'the bitter truth' about attitudes to women in India.

Officials at the jail where Singh is being held said they had asked the BBC not to show the documentary, claiming Udwin had violated the terms of the agreement allowing her to interview the prisoner.

But Udwin said on Monday she had complied fully with the agreement.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a vocal champion of women's rights in India, has so far made no comment on the row.

On Sunday he urged an end to all forms of discrimination against women, tweeting that 'our heads hang in shame when we hear of instances of crime against women'.
