Like the look of these outfits? If you do, things could finally be looking up for Marks & Spencer.  

These are the latest designs from the retailer – and the ones they are hoping will win back clothes shoppers who have abandoned it in their droves.

Belinda Earl, the 51-year-old former Debenhams and Jaeger boss tasked with turning around fashion fortunes at M&S, admitted she had suffered ‘a few sleepless nights’ ahead of the autumn/winter collection preview last night.

She was brought in as Marks's new style director last summer and said she is pushing the concept of 'fashion' rather than 'clothing'.

‘We are not afraid to raise the taste 
bar,’ she said. ‘You will be seeing a lot more fashion and a lot more of
Marks and Spencer at fashion weeks.
‘It is fashion with a capital F.’

M&S boss Marc Bolland said they want to draw in the kinds of women who may shop there for luxury food but not clothing.

He described the store’s new strategy as being ‘the same as food - 
seeing something particularly nice to eat at the weekend and having it.’

Bosses at the event said that future 
ranges would focus more on ‘high fashion’, while insisting the designs 
would also win over traditional M&S shoppers.

This soft tweedy suit with nipped-in waist and pencil skirt reaching below the knee is wool, and sexy, and classy, with a hint of stretch, and lined in silk, and women will buy it!

Okay, not teenagers, but they have plenty of places to shop; we don’t care about them. Not mums who shop in Primark, because they have no conscience. This new collection is ethical, it is cool, it is classy, and it is part of the first collection from the new broom at M&S. And I think women will adore it.

I love, love, love this gunmetal sequinned gown: it is backless, so men can see your skin. It has sleeves, so no one, NO ONE, gets to see those bingo wings. And it is a smidgeon over £100! Women of Britain, what more do you want? Blood?

The debut collection  from Belinda Earl, the Great White Hope of Marks &  Spencer, filtering into stores from July, is classy.

Yes, it is pricey – with a  wool, British-made pea coat at nearly £300 – but it is for grown-ups. Yes, I admit Belinda Earl, who gave us Designers at Debenhams and resurrected Jaeger, who told me last week she only ever bought food from Marks, has failed to cull the teen M&S label Indigo, but on the whole she knows the M&S shopper is just like her: over 50.

Not a child, not a prostitute, not a twentysomething binge drinker, but a fabulous, fit, fiftysomething.

Fabrics are great, basics are good quality, there are 80 per cent more sleeves on dresses and tops, and there is enough fashion – machine washable silk cocktail dress, covered in roses, anyone?

For £75! – to keep even a fashionista happy.  This collection is make or break for M&S: with haemorrhaging sales of womenswear, this autumn/winter range must work, or not only is Belinda for the chop, but so too will be CEO Marc Bolland.

Belinda spent her first  two months talking to women shoppers, and they told her they want quality from M&S, not bias cut gypsy skirts in crinkled linen. Let’s hope we are true to our word

Accessories: A £199 striped coat, £99 bag and £19.50 hat
