Gwyneth Paltrow must be quaking in her Tod's. First Blake Lively launched her very own lifestyle blog, just like Gwynnie's Goop, and now she's gone and launched a new designer fragrance campaign on the same day as her fellow A-list actress.

Blake has been the face of Gucci fragrances  for several seasons and dazzles in the new campaign imagery for Premiere Eau de Toilette.

Wearing a glittering gold dress and with her hair in tumbling waves, the Gossip Girl star oozes old school Hollywood glamour.

Wow! Blake Lively has just been unveiled as the face of Gucci's latest fragrance and she oozes old school Hollywood glamour in the campaign

Speaking about the new scent, Frida Giannini, Gucci’s Creative Director, said: 'In the new Première Eau de Toilette, there is a charming balance of jasmine sambac and Bulgarian rose, two classically elegant feminine flowers that are contrasted with delicate freesia. The result is a vibrant,modern feminine scent that you can enjoy wearing every day.'

Blake added: 'You spray it and you immediately feel empowered - there’s a sensuality that comes with fragrance and there’s a power that fragrance has on other people.

'But while Gucci Première represents a red carpet moment or a big night out, the new Eau de Toilette version is softer. It has all the great presence of the original, but dialled down and freshened up. You really can wear it as your everyday fragrance.'

What a difference! While Blake has been attempting to emulate Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle blog, the stars new campaigns couldn't be more different. Gwyneth looks natural and pared-back in her shoot for Boss Ma Vie pour Femme

Gwyneth, meanwhile, has just been unveiled as the face of Boss Ma Vie pour Femme, inspired by a woman who stops and pauses to enjoy the simple things in life.

Lively launched her foray into the online world of lifestyle blogging on Monday promising to be a younger more hip - and slightly less expensive - version of the fellow actress's long running site, Goop.

The 26-year-old's part blog - part store also ended up with a slightly gloopy name, specifically the jelly-inspired title Preserve.

The Gossip Girl star has previously avoided calling the site a lifestyle one, but just like Gwyneth's, Blake's offers a host of stories about cool clothes, places, foods and fashion scenes.

Cue videos of artsy snippets, stories on tattooed men and organic health remedies and, of course, a store which sells everything from spoons to clothing and hot sauces to lighting options.

The actress has been speaking of the project for months and now it is finally here, Blake was at pains to point out that she is not being a star trying to show people how to live like her, but merely pointing out how people live already.

As the name suggests, while using the modern medium of the internet, she wants her page to harken back to the small batch jam making times of yesteryear including things like preserving and promoting underground designers and produce.

Confused? Well that's alright, so is Blake.

Evolving: The 26-year-old wife of Ryan Reynolds, pictured last month, happily admits in her first Editor's Letter this is a learning curve for her

The 26-year-old wife of Ryan Reynolds happily admits in her first Editor's Letter that this is something of a learning curve for her.

She writes: 'Sitting down to write this editor’s letter has been the hardest thing I've done yet on my Preserve journey.

'I’m more intimidated than I should probably admit. I’m no editor, no artisan, no expert. And certainly no arbiter of what you should buy, wear, or eat.

'I am hungry, though... not just for enchiladas. I'm hungry for experience.

'I'm comfortable with the knowledge that I'm not a teacher, but rather, a student. I don't do any one thing perfectly. I do a lot of things though. Some well, some not-so-well.'

According to Blake, she and her team think of the site not as a lifestyle website but a 'new street.'

'A sort of greatest hits of "Main Street, USA". While the whole world races to keep up with technology, we tighten our laces, join the race, but our end goal is to preserve what's already there.

'The function of Preserve is part magazine, part e-commerce hub, part philanthropic endeavour and - above all - a place to showcase the power of imagination, ingenuity, quality, and (simply put) people.

'Preserve is a creative space. An indulgent space. A space for pleasure and fun. But also a space for knowledge. A space that honours both tradition and innovation - a space that honours the future, while having a love affair with the past...'

However, now that they both have lifestyle sites, don't expect Blake to start a war with Gwyneth. The Gossip Girl star recently name dropped her fellow online retail blogger, telling Vogue she is always in both the actress's and Martha Stewart's corner.

Blake said: 'I’m always the first person to defend Gwyneth Paltrow. Or any woman in a position of power, like Martha Stewart or Oprah, who gets burned. Because they have paved the path for so many other women who are doing something they believe in.'
