A Canadian jihadist fighting for ISIS in Syria has uploaded photographs of U.S. military kit the brutal Islamist group has seized from fleeing government soldiers in Iraq.

Posting on Twitter using the name Abu Turaab al-Kanadi, the militant shared images of everything from Humvee vehicles to M16 rifles and night vision goggles - much of which is marked as being for restricted use by the U.S. government.

Al-Kanadi, who is often referred to as simply 'The Canadian', is believed to be based in Raqqa - the Syrian city considered the capital of ISIS' self-declared caliphate.

Mocking: This image of military equipment stamped 'Property of U.S. Govt' was uploaded to Twitter by ISIS fighter Abu Turaab al-Kanadi. He captioned the photograph: 'What else you want to give us Obama?'

Captured: Al-Kanadi's photograph of a Humvee shows the military vehicle adorned with the black ISIS flag

Among the haul of U.S. military equipment Al-Kanadi claims to have in his possession are a Hummer military vehicle, night vision goggles, M16 rifles, 
crates of cartridges and hundreds of rounds stacked in magazines ready 
to fire.

He uploaded many of his photographs along with the caption: 'American tax dollars at work', in a clear effort to provoke anger from his U.S.-based followers.

Much of the equipment is believed to have been seized from fleeing government troops in Iraq - who were trained and equipped by American forces - and later smuggled across the border into Syria.

In
 one picture accompanying his night vision goggles Al-Kanadi tweets: 'Still trying to figure out how this made it into Iraq? Newcon Optik, 
Canada. It's mine now.'

Threat: Al-Kanadi poses with a gun (left), while in another photograph a cat is pictured stretching next to a live hand grenade, with the pin still inserted (right). The caption reads: 'Dogma Kitty needs to go to Baghdad'

Popular vehicle: Al-Kanadi  posted a picture of a fleet of ISIS-owned Toyota pick-up trucks,along with the caption: 'Both Toyota and IS making a killing'

In another a cat is pictured 
stretching next to a live hand grenade, with the pin still inserted. The
 caption reads: 'dogma Kitty needs to go to Baghdad.'

A further picture shows a Colt Defence automatic rifle stamped 'Property of the US 
Government', and a label saying it was made in Hartford, USA.

Another
 weapon believed to be a M16 rifle is marked: 'Restricted law 
enforcement/Government use only and Center Industries Corp, Wichita, 
Kansas.'

Al-Kanadi's photograph of a Humvee shows the military vehicle adorned with the black ISIS flag, while further tweets show pictures of brand new Oakley sunglasses of the type worn by U.S. troops.

Shocking: Earlier this week Al-Kanadi retweeted this image of British rapper turned jihadist Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier in the city of Raqqa

Gun: Another weapon believed to be a M16 rifle is marked: 'Restricted law enforcement/Government use only and Center Industries Corp, Wichita, Kansas'

Provocative: Al-Kanadi uploaded many of his photographs along with the caption: 'American tax dollars at work', in a clear effort to provoke anger from his U.S.-based followers

The militant - who earlier this week retweeted an image of a fellow 
jihadists holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier - also posted a 
picture of a Fleet of ISIS-owned Toyota pick-up trucks, under the caption: 'Both Toyota and 
IS making a killing.'

The images emerged as Syrian government troops captured a fiercely contested suburb of the capital Damascus.

The move comes after five months of heavy fighting, flushing rebels from their last hideouts and quickly moving to crush pockets of resistance in the surrounding countryside.

The fall of Mleiha, located some six miles south-east of downtown Damascus, marks the latest setback for rebels - many of them loyal to ISIS - in the area around the capital.
