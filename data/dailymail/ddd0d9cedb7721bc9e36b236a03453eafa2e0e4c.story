Design heiress Margherita Missoni has just unveiled her new children's clothing collection, but don't expect it to be over-the-top extravagant.

The 32-year-old Italy-based mom, who has an 18-month-old son, Otto, with husband Eugenio Amos and is currently expecting her second child, made sure the line, dubbed simply Margherita, was comfortable, practical and affordable.

Asked by Yahoo! Style whether she felt under 'pressure' to dress Otto in the manner of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's one-year-old daughter North West, she responded: 'No. Not at all. You have all your life to be an adult, and to dress like one - you should be a child for as long as you can.'

Margherita, whose collection launches today on Yoox and Nordstrom, also remarked that she loves children's clothes precisely because they are 'different' from adult clothes, and quipped she would love to be able to wear rompers herself.

Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, has delighted in parading North West from front row to front row at this season's biggest fashion shows, often matching her daughter's audacious attire with her own.

Notably, she dragged a rather miserable looking North West to a show at New York Fashion Week last month dressed in a silver fox fur coat, estimated to be worth more than $3,500, and donning a black fur herself.

Nori, as she is affectionately known by her friends and family, has also been used as a model for the Kardashian sisters' own childrenswear line; in September 2014 she was seen wearing a leatherette mini skirt from the range while attending Paris Fashion Week with her parents.

Laid back: Margherita's vibrant 70-piece line-up, for both boys and girls, is priced between $30 and $80, and designed for children to be able to feel 'free'

Practical: The designer explained that her 'main goals were to make clothes kids could be free in, and clothes their parents could get them in and out of easily'

 Accessible: She also remarks, 'So many baby clothes have sleeves that don’t let the baby’s arms go in and out'

Margharita's vibrant 70-piece line-up for both boys and girls is priced between $30 and $80, and designed for children to be able to feel 'free'.

'All the clothes I got before my son was born; he can’t really wear them!' she said.

'Either you can’t wash them, or they’re too hard to get on and off - you know, so many baby clothes have sleeves that don’t let the baby’s arms go in and out. 

'It’s ridiculous! So my main goals were to make clothes kids could be free in, and clothes their parents could get them in and out of easily.'

Parents: Margherita, (right) at her launch, is a former model and sometime actress, and married her racing driver husband Eugenio Amos (left) in 2012

Missoni, the eponymous label founded by Margharita's grandparents Ottavio Missoni and Rosita Missoni Jelmini in 1953, does already sell clothes for children and babies, but at sky-high prices.

A simple one-piece with matching hat and bib is currently on sale for $678 on Nordstrom.

Margherita, a former model and sometime actress, married her racing driver husband Eugenio Amos in 2012.

It is unclear exactly when her second child, which she announced over Christmas, is due, but judging from the size of her bump, it can't be too far away now.

It's a far cry from the $3,500 fur coat Kim Kardashian dressed her daughter North West in last month
