Couldn't stay away: Michael Bloomberg will return to lead the company he founded in 1981

Michael Bloomberg
will return as head of Bloomberg LP after the outgoing president became frustrated with the former mayor's increasing presence at the office, according to a report.

Bloomberg will replace Daniel Doctoroff, the company said Wednesday, despite the widely held expectation that he intended to dedicate his life to philanthropy after leaving office just months ago.

The life of leisure, it seems, is not for Bloomberg. The New York Times reports that Bloomberg has become an 'increasing presence' at the office, leaving Doctoroff 'frustrated with how the leadership dynamic had shifted.'

The privately held company, in which Bloomberg is the
majority shareholder, said Doctoroff would step aside as
president and chief executive at year-end.

Bloomberg, whose fortune is estimated at more than $32
billion, had expected to spend much of his time on philanthropic
efforts after leaving office in late 2013. Those efforts have
included fights for public health and gun control.

'This is a sad day for me and my company,' Bloomberg said in
a statement. 'I really wanted Dan to stay and continue in his
leadership role. But I understand his decision.'

Bloomberg, who stepped down as New York mayor last December,
 added he 'never intended to come back to Bloomberg LP' after 12
years as New York's mayor.

However, the Times reports that the initial 'few hours a day' he said he'd spend at Bloomberg's Manhattan offices soon turned into six and seven hours everyday in which he'd play an increasing role in decision making.

Doctoroff told Bloomberg his intention to step down two weeks ago and refused his billionaire boss's invitation to stay. 

Still pals: Though Bloomberg's right-hand man Daniel Doctoroff is stepping down over frustrations with the power shift since the former mayor left office, the two remain friends. Here, they participate in the ice bucket challenge

Moving on: Doctoroff stressed he was not leaving for anotheropportunity, but would focus more of his time on non-profitactivities. He also accepted Bloomberg's invitation to join theboard of the Bloomberg Philanthropies

'So why have I decided to leave now?,' Doctoroff said in thememo. 'Simply put, while Mike never intended to come back fulltime, after he left City Hall and started to get to know thecompany again, he rediscovered what an exciting and incredibleplace this is. So he naturally wanted to be more involved.' 

Doctoroff became Bloomberg LP president in 2008 and CEO in
July 2011. During that period, the company's revenues increased
from $5.4 billion to more than $9 billion, he said in a memo to
the company's employees. 

Doctoroff, 56, a former New York deputy mayor, told the New
York Times that he informed Bloomberg two weeks ago that he
intended to resign. Bloomberg encouraged him to stay.

'This wasn't the plan,' Bloomberg told the Times. 'It was
his idea. If it was up to me, he would have stayed.'

Bloomberg started the company in 1981, using a $10 million
severance package he received after he was laid off after
investment bank Salomon Brothers had been acquired. He had
headed equity trading at Salomon.

During Doctoroff's tenure at the company, the numbers of
subscriptions for its terminals have grown from 273,000 to
321,000, the company said in a statement. The company expanded
from providing financial information to markets for legal,
government and alternative energy information.

Doctoroff stressed he was not leaving for another
opportunity, but would focus more of his time on non-profit
activities. He also accepted Bloomberg's invitation to join the
board of the Bloomberg Philanthropies, the former Mayor said in
the statement.
