Three bumbling teens who spectacularly failed an armed robbery on a Houston sex shop have now been arrested.

The trio - one of whom was brandishing a M-16 rifle - attempted to raid Katz Boutique, a 24 hour adult store on Interstate 45, about 3.10am on April 13, but were only recently brought into custody.

The would-be thieves - aged 16, 15 and 15 - made their way through the store to the cash register, with one keeping lookout.

One had the M-16, another a revolver and the lookout appeared to be unarmed, according to The Houston Chronicle.

Entrance: Two of the trio enter the Houston adult store in the early hours of the morning, while one waits out front as lookout

Inept: After the robbery goes awry, the teens try for a quick exit, only to bump into each other

Boom: As they leave, the robbers fire back into the store, hitting a nearby mannequin

Empty-handed: The man run out with nothing to a waiting car, but keep shooting

Final round: Even once they're out, the raiders keep firing, smashing the front door and discarding a total 11 bullets

'During the robbery, the suspect with the revolver apparently bumped into the suspect with the rifle, causing the rifle to discharge,' police said.

'At that time, both males fired their weapons toward store employees as they ran out the door.'

Some shots hit a mannequin and others shattered the glass front door.

A total of 11 shots were fired, police said.

However the trio left empty handed.

Fortunately neither of the two employees in the novelty shop were hurt.

One hid when the men came in and the other happened to be in a back room at the time.

After surveillance footage was turned over to authorities, the 16-year-old carrying the rifle was arrested May 30.

The lookout was then arrested on June 4.

The second 15-year-old, who was holding the revolver, was arrested July 24.

All three were charged with aggravated robbery with a deadly robbery and remain at the Harris County Juvenile Detention Center.

'These are by far the clumsiest crooks I've seen in a long time,' Jeff Brieden, an HPD investigator in the Robbery Division, told The Houston Chronicle.

'They were unpredictable in the robbery. They fired without regard to anyone.'
