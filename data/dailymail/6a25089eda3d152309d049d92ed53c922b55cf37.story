Back on his bike: Cyclist Gavin Hill feels 'no anger' towards the bus driver who rammed him off his bike

A cyclist who was rammed off the road by a bus driver who used his vehicle ‘like a weapon’ says he feels ‘no anger’ towards him.

Father-of-two Phillip Mead, 43, was flung over his handlebars and catapulted 10ft across the road after reckless driver Gavin Hill, 29, swerved into him following a road rage bust-up at a roundabout in Bristol.

Mr Mead suffered a broken leg and fractured wrist and as he lay on the ground in agony, the driver simply straightened up the single decker bus and continued on the journey.

But Mr Mead says far from feeling anger towards the driver, he actually feels sorry for him.

The computer programmer from St Anne’s, Bristol, said: ‘It just seemed to me that it was a complete moment of madness from him.

‘It goes to show how one bit of rage can affect so many people’s lives. It has affected me and my family - but also now him and his family now he has gone to prison.

‘He was angry and he let the anger get the better of him. But I do not feel any anger towards him now - in fact I feel really sorry for his family.

‘But that couple of seconds where he lost it he has affected a lot of people for a long time.'

Sobbing Hill was jailed for 17 months at Bristol Crown Court yesterday after pleading guilty to dangerous driving and causing grievous bodily harm. A bus driver for ten years, Hill described the incident as a 'moment of madness'.

In a CCTV clip shown to the court, the 
cyclist is shown riding in front of the Bugler Coaches vehicle before 
the bus pulls out to overtake him.

But the bus then suddenly swerves to the left - knocking into Mr Mead and sending him sprawling across the road.

The cyclist said: ‘I saw the bus come alongside me, then swerve straight into me. I was thinking ‘what the hell is he doing?’.

‘As the bus came into me it touched my shoulder and over I went. My bike went off to the left and I rolled over the top of it.

Mr Mead tumbles onto the ground in a heap as the bus towers menacingly over him. He suffered a broken leg and fractured wrist in the road rage ramming

Mr Mead lies on the ground in pain after the attack but as can be seen from the CCTV the bus driver straightens up the vehicle and continues towards the traffic lights

‘I remember being on the ground and 
trying to get up - but I felt pain in my left leg. I slumped back down 
on the ground and a group of people rushed over to help me.

‘I could feel my left wrist expanding -
so I was pretty sure I had broken that. I was in pain - but I was 
probably more worried about my bike.’

Mr Mead spent two weeks in hospital and had grueling operations to repair his left knee and wrist following the incident.

He spent six weeks in plaster and was not allowed to cycle for four months but is now back on his bike and commuting to work.

Doctors inserted a 25cm metal plate in his left leg and bolted the bones in his left wrist together.

He said: 'I was desperate to get back on the bike - cycling is a passion I have had since I was 15. I was a member of the Severn Road Club and we used to cycle for miles.

'The first time I got back on the road
after the crash it was a little bit nerve-wracking. I was looking over 
my shoulder a bit more than usual.

‘But I am back cycling to work again now.

‘It happened almost a year to the day 
after I was given the all-clear for testicular cancer - so it has been a
hell of a couple of years.

‘But without my helmet it could have been a lot worse - I could have been killed.’

Wife Samantha, an office manager for an accountancy firm in Bristol, said: 'I make him text me every morning to say he has got to work safely now.

'I cannot relax until he has done it. But Phillip has not let this get him down at all - he has just got on with things.

'I still cannot believe somebody could do something like this to a cyclist.'

Hill was told he would serve half his 
sentence before being considered for release on licence, but he was 
sacked by Bugler Coaches following the incident.

Judge Mark Horton said his action 'was
not an accident' and added: 'You used the bus as a weapon to bully and 
intimidate Mr Mead.'

The shamed driver, from Frome, 
Somerset, tearfully mouthed ‘I love you’ to his sobbing family in the 
public gallery as he was taken down to the cells.

Gerald Creed, managing director of 
Bugler Coaches, said: 'We were deeply shocked when we heard of this 
incident and once we had established what had happened Mr Hill was 
immediately dismissed as we did not want him driving one of our buses 
ever again.'
