Google has been attacked by a prominent US attorney general who claimed the internet giant has 'no conscience'. 

Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, said that Google does not care about the online safety of its customers, has no regard for the damage it does and is the worst of any company he has dealt with in his 10 years in the job.

Mr Hood's attack is the latest salvo fired from a growing alliance of organisations targeting an adversary they have codenamed 'Goliath'.

The office of Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi (pictured), vowed to continue fighting Google and claimed it put its profits ahead of its customers' safety

The attack by Mr Hood was part of a report in the New York Times which revealed the alliance of opponents who are lining up against Google.

The Motion Picture Association of America has supposedly been lobbying lawmakers because they claim Google is not doing enough to take down copyrighted material.

Travel website Expedia and computer systems giant Oracle have also attacked Google for its sharp business practices.

Google's opponents have also claimed that it is failing to censor illegal sites from search results.

Mr Hood has aggressively pursued Google and in October issued a subpoena asking for records related to stolen credit card numbers and controlled substances.

But a letter he wrote to the company in November last year, released by an open records request, made clear he feels very strongly about the company.

The internet giant, which is headquartered in Mountain View, California (pictured), is coming under pressure from an alliance of groups with varying motives

Mr Hood said: 'In my 10 years as attorney general, I have dealt with a lot of large corporate wrongdoers.

'I must say that yours is the first I have encountered to have no corporate conscience for the safety of its customers, the viability of its fellow corporates or the negative economic impact on the nation which has allowed your company to flourish.'

In a statement Mr Hood's office said: 'Google has put their profits ahead of the safety of children and families and this office will continue to fight them with all the expertise at our disposal'. 

The MPAA, which is Hollywood's trade group, said that it was lobbying against Google to 'protect our members and their creative works'.

Spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said: 'When wrongdoing is taking place online, we work with and support appropriate law enforcement officials, including the attorneys general, as do many other industries.'
