This may be one of the most bizarre public service adverts ever screened - and it is funded by the UNICEF.

Starring a giant stool called Mr Poo that chases people to the toilets, the ad is designed to encourage children to use the loo in India.

In a country where only half of the population uses toilets, the United Nations Children's Fund want to tackle public health head on.

The 'Poo2Loo' campaign seeks to bring people's attention to the health hazards associated with public defecation, CNN reported.

According to UNICEF, India has the highest number of people in the world - an estimated 620 million - who defecate in public.

Studies show open defecation is almost universal amongst the poorest 20 per cent of India's population and more than 28 million children lack access to toilets in their schools.

It creates a major public health hazard by leaving an estimated 65 million kilograms of waste each day.

Children face a huge risk of contracting
 bacterial infections, with over 44 per cent of mothers disposing their 
children's waste in the open.

Diarrhoea remains one of the top causes of
 child deaths in the country, alongside respiratory infections.

With
 an animated video, a catchy song with 'toilet sounds', and even a 
smartphone application, the digitally-led campaign is targeted at the 
country's youth.

UNICEF spokeswoman Maria Fernandez said the campaign uses 'quirky, informative and inspiring language'.

'It
 also contains humour to better connect with the target audience,' she 
added. 'Once they [the youth] are exposed to the issue... they will be 
encouraged to know more.'
