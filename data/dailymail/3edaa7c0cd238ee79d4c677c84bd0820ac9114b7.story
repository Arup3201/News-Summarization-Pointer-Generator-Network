They usually use their keen sense of smell to find a bone or a tasty treat.

But this talented dog can sniff out cancer – and even detected her owner’s undiagnosed tumour.

Daisy, a ten-year-old Labrador, has now been awarded a medal for her life-saving work.

Her owner Dr Claire Guest began training her to sniff out the killer disease in urine and breath samples when she was a puppy.

Dogs have an incredible sense of smell thanks to 300million scent receptors in their noses, compared to a measly five million in the human nose.

Medical dogs are trained by sniffing samples of people already diagnosed with cancer and those of people without the disease so they can learn to tell the difference.

Daisy has found cancer in 551 patients, an accuracy rate of an impressive 93 per cent.

And she discovered Dr Guest’s undiagnosed breast cancer – the first time she has detected the disease actually growing in someone’s body, rather than by sniffing a sample.

Dr Guest, 50, chief executive of charity Medical Detection Dogs, said: ‘Daisy seemed to be pawing at my chest.

‘She bumped against my body repeatedly – I pushed her away, but she nuzzled against me again, clearly upset. She pushed me so hard that it bruised me.

‘Her behaviour was totally out of character – she was normally such a happy dog ... I felt the tender area where she’d pushed me, and over the next few days I detected the tiniest lump.

‘The bump was a perfectly harmless cyst. But further in the breast tissue was a deep-seated cancer.’

As it was caught so early, the lump was removed before the cancer had time to spread.

‘If it wasn’t for Daisy it would have gone undetected for much longer and could have been more serious,’ Dr Guest added. ‘My own pet labrador saved my life.’

Animal rescue charity Blue Cross presented Daisy, of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, with a medal for her achievements.

She faced tough competition, including JJ, a bomb detection dog who has saved soldiers’ lives in Afghanistan.

Steve Goody, the charity’s deputy chief executive, said: ‘All the judges on the medal panel were really touched by Daisy’s remarkable story and the incredible difference she has made.

‘Cancer affects the lives of thousands of people and Daisy has made a huge contribution to the diagnosis and early treatment of cancers – she’s a very deserving medal recipient.’

Daisy is now helping to train a team of 12 dogs at Medical Detection Dogs and is a ‘senior consultant’ for the UK’s first ever trial using canines to detect breast cancer.
