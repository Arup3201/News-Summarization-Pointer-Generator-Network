Head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, is paid £180,000 and has a 
flat in London as his official residence

Britain’s military top brass should sacrifice their ‘lavish lifestyles’ and move into council flats, a former government economist has said.

In an attack on the ‘grotesque’ culture of grace-and-favour privileges enjoyed by senior officers – including heavily subsidised luxury apartments – the former Chief Economic Adviser to the Ministry of Defence says up to £1 billion can be saved.

This could be done by cutting ‘questionable’ allowances to senior officers, axeing up to one in three posts above the rank of brigadier (or equivalent) and by procuring new aircraft carriers and submarines more efficiently.

Neil Davies, who retired last year, rubbished suggestions by the head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, that any further cuts to the £34billion defence budget would jeopardise Britain’s ability to win wars. 

Mr Davies said: ‘Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he? As the head of the Army, General Wall is paid £180,000 and has a flat as his official residence.

'This is a lavish lifestyle and it is shared by a number of very senior officers in the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.

'Senior officers say they require official residences in easy reach of Downing Street so they can be summoned to advise the Prime Minister at any time.

'In that case they could be found a council flat in Vauxhall – the point being that other properties could fill the same geographic criteria.

token rent on Princess Diana's former apartment in Kensington Palace and
can live there with his wife Caroline (above) for the duration of his 
time in office. The property reportedly costs the taxpayer £256,000 a 
year to run

‘At the same time, many junior ranks’ accommodation resembles council estates. Some of these flats and houses are abysmal and the comparison between the treatment of those at the top and bottom ends of the Armed Forces is grotesque.’

General Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff, pays a token rent on Princess Diana’s former apartment in Kensington Palace and can live there with his wife Caroline for the duration of his time in office. The property reportedly costs the taxpayer £256,000 a year to run.

The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas – the most senior officer in the Royal Navy – has a luxury apartment in Admiralty Arch, just off Trafalgar Square. Remarkably, none of these Service chiefs is reported to pay more than £750 a month to rent these properties, and there are many other such officers in luxury properties.

They may also claim for domestic assistance and some enjoy the services of personal chefs and drivers.

In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Davies described visiting an eight-bedroom house at the Royal Naval base in Devonport, Plymouth, which was maintained for entertaining guests by the Rear Admiral commanding ‘FOST’ – the Flag Officer Sea Training establishment.

He said it was fitted out with antiques and grand paintings like a country hotel, all at public expense.

‘The Rear Admiral admitted he and his wife hadn’t liked living there so they had moved to a much smaller place nearby, but their huge house was maintained for guests of FOST,’ he said.

‘What we have is a relic of the 1920s class system in the Armed Forces that is perpetuated through a package of privileges and remuneration to senior officers which they couldn’t maintain in civilian life and is denied even to senior officials in the diplomatic service.’

Mr Davies also said many of these officers were doing little more than ‘manning desks’ in Whitehall and that one in three could be removed from the command chain without remotely damaging Britain’s chances of winning future wars.

He said: ‘All three Services are top-heavy with senior officers, even in comparison to the US military, which is hardly an example of efficiency. Many are replicating each other’s jobs.

‘We would be better off amalgamating the three Services at the level of high-ranking commanders to end this duplication. This would mean the Armed Forces wouldn’t need to retain and promote so many officers in order to compete for the top jobs.’

The MoD's ex-Chief Economic Adviser, Neil Davies, said: 'Senior officers say 
they require official residences in easy reach of Downing Street so they
can be summoned to advise the PM at any time. In that case they could 
be found a council flat in Vauxhall'. Above, Kensington Palace

Mr Davies said politicians and civilian officials were reluctant to challenge the generals and admirals over their packages because they would have to put their own pay deals and perks under similar scrutiny.

‘At the end of the last Labour government a report was commissioned into these privileges. It was intended to highlight the cost of official residences and vehicles and the lifestyles but it was never published and effectively buried,’ he said.

On procurement, Mr Davies suggested the MoD was restricted by its relationship with the British defence industry, with companies such as BAE Systems enjoying a ‘feather-bedded monopoly’.

‘BAE won a contract to build the Astute attack-class submarines after offering a price that it simply could not afford. So it went cap in hand to the MoD claiming that it would have to default on the order unless the MoD coughed up more money. BAE are untouchable.’ 

An MoD spokesman said: ‘Senior ranks do not just fulfil command positions in the three services, they also hold senior management roles  . . . as well as positions in UK embassies, NATO and other coalition headquarters around the world.’

... as No. 10 goes to war on 'luxury' Army budget

Britain can no longer expect to punch ‘way above its weight’ on military spending, David Cameron has told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

The warning comes as the MoD fights to avoid deep cuts in this month’s spending review. 

Mr Hammond has angered No10 by refusing to sign up to any reductions that might damage frontline capabilities.

But he has been warned in stark terms by Mr Cameron that the MoD’s £34 billion budget should be regarded as generous because it is the fourth largest in the world – even though the UK economy is only sixth.

The French, who are sixth in the defence pecking order, spend £8 billion less than the British.

America accounts for 40 per cent of global defence spending with an annual £436 billion budget. China is second, with £106 billion, while Russia is third on £57 billion.

Mr Cameron said that the Chancellor is demanding ‘just’ £1.6 billion to be trimmed from  the MoD.

Mr Hammond responded by saying he would try to find ‘efficiency savings’ but would not slash deep into manpower or equipment budgets.

The exchanges between Mr Cameron and Mr Hammond took place as negotiations continue between the MoD and the Treasury ahead of the spending review on June 26.

A Whitehall source said:  ‘Mr Cameron is proud of that fact we have such powerful, well-resourced Armed Forces. But he wanted Philip to be aware that  it is something of a luxury when there is a such a pressing need to trim spending.’

The MoD has been at the centre of some of the most public, and acrimonious, exchanges about the spending review, with the head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, warning that cuts could endanger soldiers’ lives.

Sir Peter argued it would be dangerous to lose more troops when the Army is already  being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel.

‘Imposing more on us now before the last round of efficiencies have materialised properly in a balanced way would be very disruptive,’ he said.

An earlier version of this article said General Sir Peter Wall had an apartment at Kensington Palace. In fact his Army accommodation in London is at a different location. Nor does he have a country residence as was stated. We apologise for these inaccuracies.
