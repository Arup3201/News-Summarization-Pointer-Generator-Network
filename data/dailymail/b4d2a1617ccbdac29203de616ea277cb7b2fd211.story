Police in New York aching to catch world-renowned street artist Banksy have halted his activity for at least one day.

With
public overtures coming from New York officials for people to file 
complaints against the London-based man of mystery, and NYPD patrols 
increasingly looking for graffiti, Banksy cancelled Wednesday’s artwork.

The announcement was made late Wednesday morning on his website: ‘Today’s art has been cancelled due to police activity.’

On hiatus: Banksy cancelled Wednesday's artwork, it remains to be seen if he will resume his month-long one-man show

Early rumors swirled around the city 
that the anonymous artist had been arrested, but those were shot down by
an NYPD spokesperson who spoke to Gothamist.

The
website has announced the locations of each day’s work for his ‘Better 
Out Than In,’ graffiti spree across the city this month.

No further details were given.

Just last week, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg bemoaned Banksy’s month-long ‘residency’ on the city’s streets.

‘Nobody’s
a bigger supporter of the arts than I am,’ the mayor told media. ‘I 
just think there are some places for art and some places where… no art.’

‘Running
up to somebody’s property or public property and defacing it is not my 
definition of art,’ the billionaire mayor continued. ‘Or it may be art, 
but it should not be permitted, and I think that’s exactly what the law 
says.’

It is not known if Banksy will resume his one man show tomorrow.

Banksy fever took over New York as soon as the first bit of street art—a stencil of two boys stealing an actual anti-graffiti sign—hit the city as part of the artist’s month-long street show.

Veles is not the first to profit from the class crusader’s work.

When a painting of a beaver popped up on an East New York wall, some men threw a pizza box over it and started charging people $5 each to see and photograph it.

But he might be getting the richest from the found art.

Protected: The sculpture was, while it lasted, surrounded by a moat of stagnant puddle water

'No turn unstoned,' reads the caption on Banksy's website. 'A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashe cinderblocks. You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water'

‘A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,’ Veles told the New York Post.

Veles said a female collector was desperate for the work, but ‘I don’t want to say more,’ he said.

Just hours after it appeared, the statue was being pulled from the ankle-deep stagnant puddle it stood inside.

As a truck backed toward it, some people in the crowd yelled ‘all the way!’ in an apparent call for the sphinx to be destroyed rather than carted off.

Sold: Just hours after it was sighted, the sphinx was sold by the owner of a nearby auto-glass shop named Bernardo 'Choco' Veles for an unknown sum

Quick turnaround: Veles hired 20 guys to help him get the sphinx loaded into a truck

One of Veles’ workers even sold a brick out from under the sphinx for a hundred dollars.

‘You don’t own it,’ screamed Darwin Requena from the crowd.

‘Are you looking to start something,’ the worker said in Requena’s face.

'A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,' said Veles.

Veles said that an unidentified art collector desperately wanted the piece and she was swift in scooping it up. 'I don't want to say more,' he said.

‘I don’t want to fight,’ said Requena. ‘We just want to take pictures and you’re blocking it.’

Banksy's website has been documenting, and sometimes commenting on each of his one-per-day pieces.

For October 22, the site read, 'No turn unstoned. A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinderblocks.You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water.'

On Saturday, Banksy painted a picture of a boy about to smash a water sprinkler with a hammer, titled 'Better Out Than In', on the Upper West Side. Saul Zabar, of the famed grocery store family, has helped add protective Plexiglass, to preserve the artist's work on his family's building on West 79th St

Graffiti reading, 'Let the streets decide' has already been sprayed over - and cleaned off - the painting
