The hire car driven by World Cup winner and former Spurs star Ossie Ardiles when he crashed into a sheep in the Falklands was left battered and blood-splattered.

The 61-year-old Argentinian has had 20 stitches to the head following the accident last night.

This morning the motor was removed from the scene with what is believed to be the blood of the animal on the outside.

Ardiles was believed to have been in the Falklands making a television documentary with former Spurs team mate Ricky Villa, also 61.

The aftermath: Ossie Ardiles suffered a major head injury and is now recovering in a Falklands Island hospital

In a statement released from the Falkland Islands Government, Ardiles said: 'Thank you to everyone in the Islands who has helped, without exception.

'From the moment of the accident, the attention and care we have received from the police, the RAF helicopter team, the doctors and nurses here has been world class.

'Thank you to everyone for your concern, I am fine and doing well.'

It is thought Ardiles was behind the 
wheel and swerved to avoid a sheep. He suffered a blow to the head and 
was airlifted to hospital. Villa was not believed to have been injured.

South Atlantic News Agency reported that 
Ardiles was taken to King Edward Memorial Hospital in Stanley, the 
capital of the Falklands.

The extent of his injuries was unknown but a nurse at the hospital described Ardiles as 'fine'.

The car is believed to have overturned during the accident, killing the animal and leaving Ardiles needing 20 stitches to the head

Speaking
 from home in England, his son Pablo told BBC Sport: 'My understanding 
is he is fine. He has 20 odd stitches in his head and my understanding 
is he has been hospitalised overnight. But he's fine.'

Ardiles and Villa are in the Falkland Islands for a TV documentary which Ardiles' other son, who was in the car, is directing.

Four passengers have been released from hospital after treatment for minor injuries with three others detained.

'Ricky Villa and my brother were out there but they are OK and are back in the hotel,' added Pablo.

'I don't know the exact details but I 
understand my dad was driving and that he lost control somehow. I've 
heard reports he swerved to avoid a sheep but I can't confirm that.

'The main thing is he is fine, they are all OK.'

Both
 players were part of the Argentina side that won the 1978 World Cup on 
home soil. They then headed to London to join Spurs and were part of the
 team that won the FA Cup in 1981.

Meanwhile, Argentina news site 
m1nutuono reported the duo were travelling with six others when the 
vehicle lost control and overturned at around 9pm local time.Â 

'Ardiles
 and Villa had to be rescued by a military helicopter... four of the 
injured were discharged and three remain under observation,' the site 
said.

Ardiles, who also 
played for Paris Saint-Germain and Blackburn, and Villa were part of the
 1978 World Cup winning Argentina side on home soil and both won the 
1981 FA Cup with Spurs.

Both Ardiles and Villas' careers in England were curtailed by the Falklands War because of anti-Argentinian feelings at the time. The documentary they were filming is believed to be about how the conflict affected them.

In June 1982, Spurs placed Ardiles briefly on loan to Paris St Germain before he returned.

Ardiles spent a decade at the north London club before going on to have spells with Blackburn, QPR and Swindon Town.

He took over as manager of the Robins in 1989 before periods in charge of Newcastle, West Brom and Spurs.
