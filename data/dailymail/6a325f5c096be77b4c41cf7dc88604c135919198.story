Adrian Peterson has fathered at least seven children, according to one of his exes who has a four-year-old son to the NFL star.

Erica Syion, a former dancer from Dallas, Texas, came forward today to reveal she also has a child to Peterson, after a waitress claimed last night she had a three-month-old baby with him.

When asked by TMZ earlier today whether or not the Minnesota Vikings player supported his children financially, Erica said: 'To my knowledge he takes care of them all but I only found out about the other two this week.'

Erica Syion: The running back is somewhat involved in the child's life and visits him when he can though Erica criticized him on Twitter last night for not being involved enough

She said her son, who Peterson sees 
as often as he can, knows 'four other brothers and sisters. We didn't 
know the two you reported the other day'.

Last night, a Minnesota night club waitress posted on her Facebook that she was sorry her three-month-old daughter would never get 
to know her big brother - referring to Peterson's two-year-old son.

Tyrese died last week after being beaten to death by his mother's boyfriend. Peterson met him for the first time in hospital the day before he died.

He also has a six-year-old and a two-year-old with his current girlfriend.

A source told TMZ that Erica Syion has a 
financial agreement with Peterson and he gives her money for his son's 
living expenses and schooling.

The running back is somewhat involved
in the child's life, though Syion aid he could do better.

It is not clear how involved Peterson is with the unnamed waitress' baby, but a picture of the child, seen by TMZ, shows her dressed in a Vikings baby-gro, leading many to believe the mother is proud of her baby's parentage.

Sources told the website the baby's last name is listed as Peterson on her birth certificate.

On the day Tyrese died, she posted on Facebook: 'Today has been a long day finding out my [daughter's] brother passed away and knowing that she never even got to meet him.'

The waitress is said to have met the footballer when he visited the VIP section of the steak restaurant she works at, according to the Daily News.

It emerged on Friday that Peterson asked for a DNA test to confirm Ty was his about two or three months ago, before he offered to be a part of his life.

He met the two-year-old for the first time when Ty was in hospital being treated for injuries allegedly caused by Joseph Patterson.

As well as the three-month-old baby and his son Ty, Peterson has a ten-year-old daughter Adeja  and another son, Adrian Jr.

After rumors that it was Adrian Jr who had died, the running back took to social media to explain that Adrian, who lives with him, was healthy.

'My son Adrian Jr. who lives w/me is healthy. Appreciate the concern,' he tweeted on October 12.

In a separate post he said: 'The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players.'

The footballer is due to attend two-year-old Ty's funeral in South Dakota later this week.

However, a man who claims to have raised the 
murdered love child said 
people should stop sympathizing with Peterson because he didn't even 
know the two-year-old.

Bobby
Ruffin posted a rant on his Facebook page after the boy's death on 
Friday saying he was the person who raised him and he was even named 
after him.

'The boy who died was my son. Yes AP was the biological father but I raised him and he carried my name. Tyrese Robert Ruffin.

'I don’t blame AP for not really caring cuz him and I both found out recently who the biological father was. AP met my son for the first time yest [sic] when my son was already in coma.

'I was here today when we pulled the plug, not him. He was happily practicing and has no problem playing on Sunday,' he said.

The man accused of beating the child, Patterson, has been charged with aggravated assault and aggravated battery in the death of  two-year-old Ty.

Initially, police were told that the child had choked on candy. Only later did it emerge that his brain injuries were the result of being violently shaken.

The arrest was made after police found the little boy with injuries 'consistent with abuse'.

Patterson is being held in Minnehaha County Jail, South Dakota, on $750,000 cash bond and was scheduled to appear in court on October 23.
