Education Secretary Michael Gove was accused of being 'deeply frustrating' to work with by former children's minister Tim Loughton

Education Secretary Michael Gove was today accused of running his ministry like the department store in seventies sitcom Are You Being Served?

Tim Loughton accused Education Secretary 
Michael Gove, his old boss, of behaving like Young Mr Grace, the 
out-of-touch department store owner in the comedy who barely knew the people who worked for him.

And the former children’s minister slammed the ‘declining’ priority given to children and families' issues, accusing Mr Gove of ‘complete radio silence’ on the subject.

Giving evidence to the Commons Education Committee, Mr Loughton painted a devastating picture of the Department for Education (DfE) as inefficient and bureaucratic with an ‘upstairs downstairs mentality’.

‘Most officials have never met the Secretary of State other than when he will troop out a few chosen people for the new year party, Mr Grace-like from Grace Brothers, and tell us we've all done terribly well and then disappear,’ he said.

‘That is no way to run an important department. It is terribly anachronistic, terribly bureaucratic, terribly formal.’

Mr Loughton said that when he was a minister, children and families had been a ‘declining priority’ within the DfE, which appeared to have been further ‘downgraded’ since the reshuffle last September.

‘There is a particular area around child exploitation where the department seems to have gone on complete radio silence at a time when sexual abuse of children has never had a higher profile in public consciousness and the media post-Savile,’ he said.

Mr Loughton said Mr Gove was like the elderly Young Mr Grace (centre) in 1970s sitcom Are You Being Served? who rarely met or visited those working on the shop floor

‘That is deeply, deeply worrying and I hope that doesn't signify any downgrading of the priority that it absolutely is.’

He said that when he became a minister he had been alarmed to discover that many of the officials in the DfE responsible for drawing up child protection regulations had never even met a social worker.

‘These were people who were drawing up the regulations, who were responsible for government safeguarding policy ... and too many people working in the Department for Education had never actually been out with a social worker before, which I found alarming,’ he said.

There was a culture of not answering questions properly at the department, Mr Loughton told MPs

‘If the department is going to be a delivery department, we need to have more people who actually know about the job and what it delivers rather than producing a nice glossy brochure and thinking that that's the end of the story.’

Mr Loughton also complained ministers never met without civil servants present and that the weekly ministerial meeting was frequently either cancelled or attended by ‘a cast of thousands’ which made it impossible to discuss strategic thinking.

'Too often one was having to double guess what the boss (Mr Gove) might think. It was deeply frustrating,' he said.

At the same time the way the department worked was 'deeply inefficient', with ministers denied open access to the officials working for them.

'There is a bit of an upstairs downstairs mentality. The ministers were all posted on the seventh floor. Officials were summoned to your office,' he said.

'When I just wanted to have a quick chat with a particular official about a query it had to be a diarised meeting and that person was summoned. Occasionally I played hooky and actually went to another floor. It was like a state visit.

'I literally had to give my private office the slip in order to go and have a two-minute conversation with an official.'

He said there was a culture within the department of giving 'as little information as possible' when it came to answering MPs' questions, with the responses vetted by special advisers before they were signed off by ministers.

'The parliamentary question system is there for parliamentarians to ask for information to which they are entitled. I think we as ministers and we as a department have a duty to give it. That was not the culture in the Department for Education,' he said.
