Britons are far more likely to work beyond the retirement age than any of their counterparts in the main EU nations, official figures revealed yesterday.

Nearly one in five continue in employment after the age of 65 in the UK – more than three times the number in France and almost double that in Germany.

And growing evidence suggests they often do so to help support their grandchildren.

Only in a handful of the EU’s less developed countries is there a higher proportion of working pensioners than in the UK.

Figures for 2012, published by the EU’s statistics arm Eurostat, found that 19.4 per cent of Britons aged 65 to 69 were in employment.

In France, which has failed to shrug off the recession and where unemployment remains at record levels, only 5.9 per cent had jobs.

That compares with 12.7 in the Netherlands, 11.1 in Germany, 8 in Italy and 6.6 in Belgium. Across the 28 nations of the EU – where the average employment rate among over-65s was 11 per cent – only Estonia, Romania and Portugal had a higher proportion of people working beyond the retirement age.

And those three countries all have far less developed economies than the UK.

There is growing evidence that many work past their retirement age for financial reasons, separate research shows.

In particular, pensioners are increasingly under pressure to help out their children, who are faced with the difficulties of raising their own young families.

They use the cash they earn to pay for childcare and extras for the grandchildren – but it means they have less free time to help look after them.

A study commissioned by insurance and pensions company Aegon UK found that 29 per cent of workers in Britain intend to remain in employment at least part-time during the early years of their retirement to increase their incomes.

It suggested that the growing number of people staying in work into their late 60s and beyond is likely to mean there will be fewer grandparents who are willing to devote their time to looking after their grandchildren (file)

It suggested that the growing number of people staying in work into their late 60s and beyond is likely to mean there will be fewer grandparents who are willing to devote their time to looking after their grandchildren.

At present, nearly 10million grandparents are thought to care for their grandchildren while their children are at work.

‘Many parents rely on the generosity of a grandparent to help with childcare,’ said David Macmillan of Aegon UK.

‘And this trend may have a significant impact on the amount parents need to set aside for childcare costs.

‘We may well see grandparents continuing to work not just for their own financial needs but in order to support younger family members with childcare costs, school fees and broader costs such as the ability to get on the housing ladder.’

The Aegon UK poll, which was conducted by Cicero Consulting, questioned 16,000 adults in 15 countries.
