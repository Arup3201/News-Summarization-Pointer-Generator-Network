Formula One drivers will have to be at least 18-years-old from 2016.

The announcement of new rules by motorsport governing body FIA on Tuesday came following the Toro Rosso team's decision to hire 17-year-old Max Verstappen for this year's championship.

Max Verstappen will become the youngest F1 racer ever when he drives a Toro Rosso in 2015

From 2016, drivers will also need to have accumulated a certain amount of points in other motorsports series, to have spent at least two years in junior categories, and hold a valid road driver's license to become eligible for F1.

Under the new Super License points system, adopted in December at a World Motor Sport Council, drivers will also need to successfully answer questions on F1 regulations.
