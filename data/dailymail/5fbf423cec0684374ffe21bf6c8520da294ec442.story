A couple have been accused of mentally and emotionally abusing their 16-year-old adopted son by isolating him from the rest of the family, forcing him to live alone in the uninhabitable basement and even feeding him different food to their biological children.

Eric Corcoran and Angela Corcoran of  Livingston County, New York, are charged with second-degree child abuse, reportsDetroit Free Press.

The pair, both 43, are accused of years of abuse, beginning when the teen was aged 12 and they forced him to eat different meals than the family and only being allowed to 'sit in corner of one room of the main home.'

Angie Corcoran is accusing of slapping the teen's legs while he slept as well as hitting him with a a hanger, which broke.

Eric Corcoran, admitted to protective services that the door separating the basement from the main level of the home is locked so the teen can not access the home.

He said that the boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, uses the camper toilet when no one else is home, according to court documents. 

The teen's room in the basement was sparse according to a CPS worker.

It had a twin bed, but no sheets, blankets or pillows despite the basement being 'colder than the rest of the house.' 

Protective services noted the boy's meals were left on the top of the stairs for him, court documents alleged.

The teen, who is now in foster care, was so lonely he even created a family for himself using stuffed animals.

He told protective services that his brother punched him and his sister threatened him with a gun, according to court documents.

Eric Corcoran told protective services that his then-adopted son lashes out at people and steals things throughout the house, court records show.
