After being photographed in New York wearing stylish brogues and sending her own models down the catwalk in flats during London Fashion Week, it seems Victoria Beckham is hot-footing a new trend.

Designers in Milan have taken notice of Victoria's style with Dolce & Gabbana showcasing models in a variety of flat shoes at their AW14 show.

Meanwhile Marni and Giorgio Armani's have also offered flats as the answer to summer shoe style.

Giorgio Armani championed flats at his Milan Fashion Week show, opting for classic black velvet with the occasional jolt of silver.

Trussardi offered more androgynous flats, sending models down the catwalk in monochrome brogues toughened up with gold buckles and fringing.

Victoria, 39, once 
said she 'couldn't concentrate in flats' and 'beyond hated' ballet shoes but has had to learn to love them after being told to ditch the heels in 2011.

She suffered a slipped disc following
 the birth of daughter Harper Seven and was under doctor's 
orders to wear comfortable shoes.

Since then, other celebrities have been ditching the heels including Poppy 
Delevingne and Olivia Palermo who opted to wear sensible flats at the Anya Hindmarch show this season.

 Poppy adorned her feet with a now sold-out pair of heart-print 
calf-hair slippers from Burberry, which retail at £350. The shoes have a
 mirrored gold heel and a red satin insole.

Meanwhile, It-girl Olivia, 27, stuck to a black Aladdin-inspired pair of slippers which were covered in jewels.

Always one to be ahead of the trend, Alexa Chung, who has long championed flats, was spotted out and about over London Fashion Week in comfortable footwear.

The presenter has, however, swapped her much-loved ballet pumps for more on-trend New Balance trainers.

But can flat shoes ever be as stylish or flattering as heels?

Speaking about the new trend, Alex Longmore, celebrity stylist and Hotter shoes Ambassador, said: 'I for one am so pleased to see that flat shoes are taking centre stage at all the runway shows in Milan.

'I love the wedge soled punk-esque wedge flats at Trussardi and T-bar flats at Dolce.

'I’m not surprised this trend is becoming so big, it’s been creeping in for a few past seasons now: Brogues have been big news for a while, so has the loafer having its own style revival this summer.

'Charlotte Olympia's kitten flats have been seen on every celebrity from Fearne Cotton to Beyoncé. Alexa Chung is a trailblazer for flats choosing to ditch high heels and wear the look for formal events.

'The high street have some great flat styles out there right now, my favourite being the black suede loafers from Hotter.

'Finally we have a trend that makes sense, every woman wants to be comfortable and look stylish at the same time. With more women leading demanding lives, gone are the days running for the bus in a pair of towering Jimmy Choo heels.

'I think here has always been a bit of a taboo about how flats can't be flattering, but with the right trouser leg length or skirt length, this can actually be an incredibly flattering shoe and make anybodys legs look longer.

'Bring on the flats I say and the sooner the better.'

Thomas Merrigan, menswear writer at OxbloodAndWolf.Wordpress.com, said: 'It is undeniable that there is an attraction to a women in heels. Although I would say that this is often radiated by their own self confidence, which comes with wearing them.

'Flat shoes on a woman can also be attractive, especially in adapted traditionally masculine silhouettes, such as a brogue or penny loafer a la Alexa Chung.'
