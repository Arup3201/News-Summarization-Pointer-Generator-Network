Disgraced former Tyco executives Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz have left a minimum-security prison in New York for clerical jobs and overnights in apartments.

Former CEO Mr Kozlowski and ex-chief financial officer Mr Swartz are among 304 inmates in the state's work-release program. They have each served over eight years in prison for one of the most prolific fraud schemes in US history.

Mr Kozlowski and Mr Swartz oversaw garnered over $600million through unauthorized loans, bonuses and stock manipulation by treating the firm as a personal ATM.

After a period spending nights or weekends back at Lincoln Correctional Facility, they now only have to report in weekly. The two men still face a parole hearing.

Defense attorneys say their clients should get paroled after completing the minimums of their 8 1/3-to-25-year sentences for corporate fraud and paying $134 million in restitution to Tyco and $105 million in fines.

They were sentenced to 8 1/3-to-25-years in prison for 22 counts of grand larceny, conspiracy, falsifying records and violating business law.

Kozlowski and Swartz were found guilty of giving themselves as much as $150 million in illegal bonuses and forgiving tens of millions of dollars in loans to themselves.

There were also found guilty manipulating the price of the security systems company's stock by lying about the state of its finances. Some estimates peg ill-gotten stock gains by Mr Kozlowski at almost $500million.

The release programs are for inmates considered nonviolent, with each individual and job approved by a corrections department committee. The panel has authority to reject any work in which the inmate has an opportunity to repeat past crimes.

'Technically you're still an inmate,' Correction spokeswoman Linda Foglia said. 'You're following a strict contract.'

Mr Swartz, 53, is a law office assistant
and Mr Kozlowski, 66, is a clerk at a technology company. Their lawyers
and state officials won't say where the men are working or living.

The details of their prolific fraud paled in comparison to the outrageous purchases and expenses Mr Kozlowski accrued while at the Tyco helm.

The greedy chief exec demanded Tyco pay for his New York apartment - which the firm bought for $17million and spent another $11million decorating, officials said. Firm funds were also used for multiple vacation homes, including a sprawling Nantucket, MA., beachfront estate, said officials.

The firm was based in Boca Raton, FL after moving from New Hampshire not long before Mr Kozlowski acquired the apartment.

Senior executives also used the move as an excuse to raid company coffers for multiple homes across the Sunshine State and millions of dollars in art purchases, officials said.

Tyco infamously bought Mr Kozlowski a $6,000 gold-threaded shower curtain, a $15,000 dog-shaped umbrella stand, a $2,200 wastebasket, coat hangers costing almost $3,000, $6,000 sheets, a $1,600 notebook and a $45 pincushion, according to regulators.

The firm also footed half the bill for a $2million 40th birthday party Mr Kozlowski threw for his wife in Sardinia.

The week-long Roman-themed toga bash included an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David with vodka flowing from its penis, a Jimmy Buffet performance and a breast-shaped birthday cake with sparklers.

'It's going to be a fun week, sailing on the Endeavor, tennis, golf, eating, drinking. All the things we are best known for,' Mr Kozlowski said on footage from the beginning of the hedonistic party shown to jurors.

Though a 20-minute tape of the party was shown to jurors, many scenes were deemed to racy to show - likely why the party became known as the 'Tyco Roman Orgy.'

Spreading the grift, Mr Kozlowski ordered a $20million payment to a friend of his as a 'consulting fee,' said investigators.

Mr Kozlowski additionally donated millions of Tyco dollars to charities in his name, reaping the tax benefits, authorities claimed.

Adding insult to injury, his wife divorced him shortly after he went to prison and soon married a property developer, according to reports at the time.

The excess to which Mr Kozlowski led his life likely contributed to an April 2012 parole hearing being denied, with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office saying it would 'undermine' the rule of law.
