Police are looking for a man who deliberately attached a 'suspicious looking device' to a barrier outside a building on Wall Street this morning.

Parts of the Financial District in Lower Manhattan had to be sealed off after a call was made to police about a suspicious object being found.

A two block radius around 40 Wall Street was shut down just after 10 a.m.

Deserted: Although no buildings were evacuated, the placing of a 'suspicious looking object' lead to several streets being sealed off while the NYPD bomb squad investigated

The NYPD Bomb Squad responded to the call but it turned out to be a false alarm.

Sources say the object appeared to be a small flash hard drive with a circuit board and wires wrapped in putty, fixed to a barrier.

Hoax device: The NYPD have confirmed the object was made of clay with a flash drive attached to it and wires sticking out

Paul Browne from the NYPD said there was no doubt the item was left to cause alarm: 'The way it was done, where it was placed
and its components were done in a way to give the impression of some 
sort of explosive device. They probably intended to cause some kind of disruption but no evacuations were required and the street reopened about an hour later.'

Lower Manhattan: Wall Street is the home to the New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest - the area has some of Manhattan's tallest buildings and narrowest streets in the city

Sealed off: An area of two blocks around 40 Wall Street was sealed off at 10am on Friday morning. The disruption only lasted for one hour before the street was reopened once again

The barrier was in front of the Trump Building which is one of the tallest office buildings in Lower Manhattan.

The Bomb Squad 'deemed the package to be safe and not any hazard to community', giving the all-clear.

Investigators are reviewing security camera footage to see if they can find the man who left the object.
