Sam Allardyce has hit back at Mo Diame by claiming his performances at West Ham were not good enough to command a regular first-team spot in his favoured place of centre midfield.

New Hull signing Diame, who could make his Tigers debut against his old side in Monday night's Premier League showdown, accused Hammers boss Allardyce of stalling his career and 'shunting' him around the team.

But Allardyce responded by insisting Diame's displays at Upton Park did not warrant such treatment.

Diame scored goals in big games for West Ham but failed to build on his promising first season at the club

Sam Allardyce was adamant that the player's performances were the reason he failed to hold down his place

Allardyce said: 'It's Mo's opinion, isn't it? He had two seasons with us. We expected him to improve on his first season and he did not go on as far as we expected from there on.

'Mo would have continued to play in centre midfield had his performances continued to be as good as his first season. Those performances didn't quite live up to the ones he gave us in his early part of his career here with us.

'My responsibility is the team and the whole team, not one player. I have to look after 25 players and select the best team. If he wasn't happy and he's moved on then that's fine.

'A player picks himself. A player drops himself - not me. When the performances don't fall to the level you expect then the position is in jeopardy.' Allardyce signed Morgan Amalfitano in a £2million deal from Marseille before allowing Diame to leave for the KC Stadium on deadline day.

Allardyce added: 'Mo was running out of contract and we got a fantastic offer from Hull City. He came on a free transfer so we made a handsome profit on the deal. It was good business all round. 

'We got Morgan in and Mo got what he wanted - a move and a big contract.' West Ham were linked with Manchester City's Micah Richards on deadline day, but he went to Fiorentina instead.

Allardyce continued: 'That's not strictly true. We could not meet the financial demands of Man City.' 

Enner Valencia is ready to make his first West Ham start in the Premier League against Hull City on Monday night after improving his fitness on international duty with Ecuador.

Mo Diame's career had stalled at West Ham and he claimed he had been 'shunted' away from his best position

The £12million striker played 90 minutes against Brazil and scored in a 76-minute outing versus Bolivia on international duty last week.

James Collins missed Wales' 2016 European Championship qualifier with Andorra in midweek due to a hamstring injury, but West Ham manager Sam Allardyce confirmed the centre-back is available.

Carl Jenkinson (hamstring), Matt Jarvis (thigh), Andy Carroll (ankle) and Kevin Nolan (shoulder) have all started training of some form in their bid to return to the squad, but the trip to the KC Stadium comes too soon for the quartet.

There had been suggestions Carroll could return before his scheduled return of November, but Allardyce refused to put a date on his return.

Allardyce said: 'Andy has started jogging but I don't want to put a time frame on it. We will be guided by the specialists and we will not take any risks too early.' Allardyce insists West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald will not be leaving Upton Park despite a link with Carlisle.
