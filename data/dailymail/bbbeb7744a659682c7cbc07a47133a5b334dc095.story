This is the first photograph of the British teacher and her fiance whose car was flipped over by an enraged bull elephant while they were on safari in Africa.

Sarah Brooks, 30, and her fiance Jans de Klerk were filming the animal from their car as it drank at a waterhole when it turned and went for them.

The elephant’s tusk ripped through Miss Brooks’ upper thigh during the attack at  the Kruger National Park in South Africa, and she had to be airlifted to hospital and required an emergency operation to save her leg.

The teacher, from Spalding in Lincolnshire, spent several says in hospital after the attack.

She
 has since been discharged and is believed to still be in the country 
recovering with her fiance Jans de Klerk, who escaped unhurt.

The
 couple were on holiday to celebrate their recent engagement and for 
Miss Brooks to meet her fiance’s South African family, friends said.

A video captured the moment the elephant launched its attack on the car. 

The terrifyingly angry animal pushed the car on to its roof with ease and then trampled on it

On the video, tourists in car behind the couple can be heard urging them to reverse, with one man screaming 'Stop the car ... reverse, reverse, they're going to die'.

William Mabassa, general manager at the National Park said the elephant was in Musth, a periodic condition in males that makes them aggressive when their testosterone levels rise by up to 60 times. It also had an injury, which is believed to have increased its aggressiveness.

Mr Mabassa told the Telegraph: 'As they were driving behind the elephant, probably also taking a video of the elephant in front of them, the elephant apparently decided to turn around'.

'Unfortunately they switched off the engine - because if you minimise noise an elephant would not attack you - (but) unfortunately the elephant attacked,' he added.

Park
 officials later shot the elephant, a decision Mr Mabassa defended by saying: 'Our rangers reported that the same elephant bull had been involved in previous fights with other dominant bulls since it has been in musth phase'.

African
 bull elephants can weigh up to six tons. Describing the December 30 
attack, park spokesman William Mabasa said: ‘The elephant suddenly 
stopped, turned around and rapidly walked towards the vehicle, which was
 stationary.

‘It charged at them, attacked the vehicle and flipped it over off the road into the thick bushes.’

Miss
 Brooks, who studied biomedical science at Northumbria University and 
now teaches at a school in Spalding, was discharged from the Medi-Clinic
 Nelspruit earlier this week.

Neighbours at the home she shares with her fiance said yesterday that she was yet to return from South Africa.

Lyn
 Skells, a retired teacher who has been friends with Mr de Klerk for 
three years, said the couple have extended their stay for another three 
weeks as they recover from their ordeal.

She
 said: ‘They had just got engaged and were on holiday so she could meet 
all his family in Africa. It really is awful what happened at what 
should have been a happy time for them.’

The attack was believed to be the third by an elephant at the Kruger park last year.

Another
 of the animals was shot dead earlier in December when it charged at 
traffic officers. It had apparently ignored warning shots.

Two tourists were also injured when their vehicle was overturned by an elephant in April.

And
 British pensioner Colin Manvell, 68, was trampled to death by a wild 
bull elephant while bird-watching at a jungle waterhole in Tamil Nadu, 
southern India, last year.

Mr Mabasa advised park visitors to keep a safe distance from wild animals.
