A married, conservative Christian politician with five children who was caught on video kissing a female staffer at his office has offered a contrite apology.

GOP Representative Vance McAllister of Louisiana, is allegedly seen on tape passionately kissing a woman believed to be Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33.

Surveillance tape from December 23 recorded inside McAllister's office in Monroe, shows him engaged in a stolen clinch with Peacock, who is his district scheduler - and the wife of a childhood friend.

In a statement issued on Monday, McAllister said: 'There's no doubt I've fallen short and 
I'm asking for forgiveness. I'm asking for forgiveness from God, my 
wife, my kids, my staff, and my constituents who elected me to serve.

Named: This is Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33, - who has been named as the woman caught in a clinch with married GOP Representative Vance McAllister, of Louisiana

Friends: Kelly and Vance McAllister (left) are friends with Heath and Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock (right) - the Peacocks donated $10,400 to the McAllister campaign fund last year 

'Trust is something I know has to be 
earned whether your a husband, a father, or a congressman. I promise to 
do everything I can to earn back the trust of everyone I've 
disappointed.'

On the tape, a man believed to be McAllister, is seen wearing a crumpled, purple shirt. He turns off the lights in the room before a woman with long, dark hair and is wearing a beige trench coat, short skirt and knee-high boots, comes to stand beside him.

The couple peck each other on the lips then have a long, lingering kiss. The man then sets what appears to be an alarm panel on the wall and both leave the building.

They are both caught on an outside security camera exiting the building, the woman first and then McAllister. When they get to the driveway of the building, they separate.

Vance McAllister and his wife Kelly (far right) whom he married 17 years ago. The couple have five children

McAllister, a veteran and businessman, 
entered the House of Representatives in November after campaigning on a 
ticket of Christian, family values.

He has been married to wife Kelly Duncan McAllister for 17 years. The couple have five children and live in rural Swartz, east of Monroe in Louisiana.

Their oldest daughter Anna Claire Rogers, 19, was adopted by the McAllisters in 2010 and now attends the University of Louisiana at Monroe.

They have four other children Emilie Katherine, 12, Duncan Michael, nine, Vance, five, and three-year-old Eva Grace.

McAllister, played up his membership of the North Monroe Baptist Church during his congressional campaign. 

It was also revealed that Peacock and her husband, Heath, 34, donated $10,400 to McAllister last fall and the couples have been friends for many years.

Facebook pictures posted online to Kelly McAllister's profile show both couples together at a birthday party in 2009.

Indeed, McAllister and Heath Peacock grew up three miles apart and they both graduated in 1990 from the same high school.

McAllister also worked with Heath Peacock over a 16-year period for Mustang Engineering, a Houston, Texas-based oil and gas company.

McAllister’s campaign benefited from support from the Robertson family 
of Duck Dynasty fame. Phil Robertson publicly supported McAllister 
while Willie Robertson endorsed McAllister in a YouTube video.

He describes his decision to run for Congress as a 'prayerful one. Many people make light of my spiritual faith, but that is okay with me. I know the blessing that I have received from the good Lord and the inner peace that comes from being a believer'.

He went on: 'I knew there were a number of qualified people in the district to be congressman, but also I realized that I had the time and the financial capability ... that maybe [the others] didn't.'

Calls to McAllister's office seeking further comment went unanswered on Monday.
