A 35-year-old man who lost 500 pounds must now wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin and says he is still trapped inside his 'own fat suit.'

Thomas Towle III, from Gardiner, Maine, admits he suffered an addiction to eating and only took stock when his doctor told him he faced an early death if he did not lose weight.

After being a big child, he became even more overweight when he was a teenager and Towle was forced to drop out of high school when he became too embarrassed of his size, reports the Press Herald.

Towle admits he suffered an addiction to eating and only took stock when his doctor told him he faced an early death if he did not lose weight

'I did an amazing job, I think, of putting a great face on, letting no one know how much being that heavy bothered me,' he said. At one point he weighed almost 800lbs.

'I made jokes at myself to survive. If someone was making fun of me, I made fun of myself harder. That way your jokes didn't hurt me, or at least you thought they didn't hurt me. 

Inside, it was a totally different story. It crushed me inside.'

Towle tried several diets which all worked but as soon as he pulled back, he put the weight on again.

He eventually began to lose weight when he got a job at McDonald's and he left the house and moved around more.

He said that although he suffered pain in his joints from the excess weight they supported, he was able to sit down on a stool and serve customers.

He now weighs about 270 pounds, and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds

'I learned to work at McDonald's, and I lost weight,' he said. 

'I was actually getting out of the house. Even though I might not have been standing up and doing exercise, I think the motion, the actual getting out, was a big first step in losing some of that weight.'

He lost about 200 pounds through an improved diet and additional exercise, bringing him down to 600 pounds.

Eventually Towle decided to have weight-loss surgery, although he had to lose another 50 pounds to be a safe weight to have the operation.

In June 2011, Towle underwent gastric bypass surgery and a portion of his stomach was used to create a second smaller stomach.

Towle can no longer eat some of his favorite foods as a result because they can make him vomit.  

He now weighs about 270 pounds, and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds.

But he has has to wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin. 

He says his faces a daily regime of three compression garments everyday as well as creams and powders to treat his extensive rashes and dry tearing skin.

Towle needs reconstructive surgeries to remove the excess skin from his chest, abdomen and legs.

The procedures are predicted to cost close to $30,000 and Towle thinks his insurance company will pay for at least a portion of the bill, but he is now appealing for help in paying the rest of it on his Go Fund Me page.

He wrote: 'I am still trapped inside my own fat suit of skin that just hangs there and affects my everyday life, making it depressing to think I have come so far yet I am still trapped. 

'I am asking you to please help me shed this one last obstacle in the way between me and a true new beginning a life that can be lived to the fullest.

'I wish insurance understood I don't want to be the next sex symbol I just want to be free of this burden.'
