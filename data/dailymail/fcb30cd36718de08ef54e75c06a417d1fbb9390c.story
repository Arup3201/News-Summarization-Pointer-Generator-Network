Worrying: Criticism of the state pension in Britain has come at a time when the age of qualification is likely to rise along with the life expectancy of citizens

State pensions in Britain are the worst in any major European economy, a report has revealed.

Even former Eastern bloc nations such as Slovenia, Hungary and Slovakia are among those where provision is more generous as a proportion of average incomes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

A total of 12.3million people in Britain have reached the State pension age – between 61 and 68 – and are entitled to a maximum payout of £110.15.

The National Pensioners Convention, which will lobby MPs today for a better deal, says a decent ‘living State pension’ would be £178 a week.

The OECD also said yesterday that babies born in Britain this year will ‘probably’ be 70 before they can claim a state pension.

At present, a man can start claiming his State pension from the age of 65 and a woman can start to claim her pension from the age of 61 and nine months.

Both State pension ages are being increased. By 2018, it will be 65 for women as well as men, and will then keep on rising for them both to 66 in 2020, 67 by 2028 and will keep on going up.

Stefano Scarpetta, a director of the OECD, pointed out that many babies born this year will also live to celebrate their 100th birthday which means their retirement will last for least 30 years.

A baby girl born this year has a one in 2.5 chance of living to 100, while a baby boy has just under a one in three chance, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.

If the State pension age was not increased, it would raise the prospect of a cripplingly expensive State pension system in which people retired at 65 but survived for several more decades.

Overall, the OECD’s research, published yesterday, looks at the ‘replacement rate’ - that is the percentage of their final salary that is ‘replaced’ by their State pension.

In Britain, it is typically only 32.6 per cent for an average earner, compared with an average across the OECD’s 34 countries of 40.6 per cent.

Pressure: The National Pensioners Convention, which will lobby MPs today for a better deal, says a decent 'living State pension' would be £178 a week, almost £70 short of the current maximum weekly payment

It is far higher in other countries than it is in this country. For example, it is 42 per cent in Germany, 58.8 per cent in France, 45.7 per cent in Norway and as high as 76.6 per cent in Austria.

In the Slovak Republic the figure is 67.9 per cent, in Hungary 73.6 per cent and in Slovenia 40.6 per cent - all higher than in the UK.

Mr Scarpetta raised his concerns about the future facing young people as Governments put pressure on people to save for themselves, rather than rely on the State to fund their retirement.

He said: ‘I am very concerned that we are moving towards a more contribution-based system but in many countries especially young people have been unemployed.

‘They are outside the labour market so they are not contributing (into a pension).

‘We hope the economy will kick on and then many of them will indeed get into a job and so on and so forth.

Repost: Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, above, defended the changes to the pensions system, saying: 'We are building a UK pension system that is more sustainable for the future'

‘But they will have fewer years of 
contribution so potentially there is also a long-term effect of the 
current crisis which in some countries has been particularly severe, 
especially for the young generation.’

Nearly one million people in Britain 
between the age of 16 and 24 are currently unemployed, according to 
official figures from the Office for National Statistics.

Young people aged 22 and over are currently being signed up to a pension scheme by their boss if they earn more than £9,440. But they must, obviously, have a job in order to qualify.

Under the standard OECD economic assumptions, full career workers would expect a significant increase in their replacement rates, assuming a contribution level of eight per cent of their income.

Average earners are estimated to reach a 55.4 per cent replacement rate, with low earners at 76.2 per cent and high earners at 48.4 per cent, bringing the UK much closer to the OECD average.

Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners’ Convention, highlighted the nightmare facing today’s pensioners surviving on such a paltry pension payout.

The OECD looked at the future facing young people joining the labour market today, working hard and examined the sort of pension that they can expect to receive.

She said: ‘Older people are facing a daily struggle with rising costs of living, inadequate pensions and cuts to services they need such as day care centres, social care and bus services.

‘The UK economy can still afford to give all older people certain basic rights in retirement such as a living state pension, dignified care and an end to loneliness and fuel poverty.’

Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, said: ‘We are building a UK pension system that is more sustainable for the future.

‘As the OECD recognises, by combining the state pension and income from workplace pensions people many people in Britain can expect an adequate retirement income.’
