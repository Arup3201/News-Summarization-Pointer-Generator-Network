When Sir Chris Hoy had a velodrome named after him ahead of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, he probably presumed he could enter the arena at his own accord.

But on Thursday, the six-time Olympic Champion was reportedly asked to present his ID by security on the first day of action.

Blushes were said to have been spared eventually, with BBC Radio 5LIve reporting that the young girl responsible said: 'My Mum's going to kill me!' And Chris Hoy later tweeted... 'she was just doing her job!'

Hoy, who is reporting for the BBC in his home country, insisted he was delighted with the facility, though others believe it is not enough for a man who has given so much to the sport.

Bradley Wiggins, who will be competing in the velodrome this summer, said: ‘It is a bit odd. I’d be a bit p***** off if I were him because they’ve stuck a great big Emirates sign over his name and it doesn’t stand out that it’s the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome other than a little thing as you walk in. It’s more like a shopping sign with an Emirates thing on it.'

‘I think there should be more made for him. Stick a whopping great statue outside because it doesn’t hit you straight away that it’s his velodrome. I think he got done over a bit.

‘But he won’t complain because he’s far too nice. So I’ll complain for him. They should do something about it.’
