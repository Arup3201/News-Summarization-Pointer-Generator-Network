Christopher Davies, 40, told police he was a drug dealer after he was arrested for dealing heroin

A criminal caught supplying heroin in a city centre told police he was a drug dealer as they arrested him, a court heard.

Christopher Davies, 40, was caught selling the drug on the streets of Tredworth, Gloucester, on November 27th last year.

He was taken to Gloucester police station - where he candidly told officers he was a drug dealer.

Davies admitted possessing heroin with intent to supply and was jailed for two years and nine months at Gloucester crown court today.

Jailing Davies, Judge Jamie Tabor QC said that Davies’ comment about being a drug dealer would usually 
entitle him to maximum credit for an early guilty plea.

But the judge said he interpreted the words as a joke by Davies - rather than an early show of remorse.

Tabor told him: 'Heroin is a very dangerous drug as you know from your own addiction.'

In court today, prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said three police officers on patrol in High Street, Tredworth, Gloucester, saw two men and a woman on the streets at about 2.20pm that day.

The officers saw what looked like a drug deal taking place - Davies handed something to one of the others.

As Davies did so he looked up, saw the officers, and made off.

However, Pc Richard Handley pursued and caught him. He placed him under arrest but Davies began to struggle and was taken to the ground.

He was seen to throw something into the road and two clingfilm wraps of heroin were found.

In his left trouser pocket were another 8 wraps of clingfilm containing the drug and £140 in cash.

His car was searched and a further wrap of the drug was found.

In total he had 45.8grams of heroin with a street value of £2,290, said Mrs Hennessy.

Having been caught red handed, Davies was taken to Gloucester police station, pictured. There he told officers who asked him his employment status he was a drug dealer

'When asked his employment status he said he was a drug dealer,' she said

'He went on to say he was a heavy drug user himself and supplied to be able to pay for that.

'He also said "You would have to be off your bloody face to walk down the road with all that sh*t."'

Joe Maloney, defending, said there was a ‘very positive’ pre-sentence report from the probation service on Davies.

'Last year he became dependent on drugs for a while but this arrest was a turning point and he has addressed the issues that led to him committing these offences,' he said.

After being told he was going to prison Davies pleaded for a change of heart, saying he had a young family who would suffer.

'I am truly sorry for what I have done,' he said. 'I have got a family and I am not what you think I am.'

He said that a prison term for him would be far more damaging than for many.

'I will not ever be in this court again,' he said.

But the judge told him the sentence was not just to punish him but also to deter other dealers in hard drugs.
