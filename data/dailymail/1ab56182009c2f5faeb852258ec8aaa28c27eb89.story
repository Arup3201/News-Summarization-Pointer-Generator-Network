A High Court judge today ruled that a little boy with brain damage should be taken off a life-support machine despite his parents' pleas to keep him alive.

Specialists had told Ms Justice Russell that the youngster - who turned one earlier this year - had suffered irreversible brain damage and it was in the youngster's best interests for live-sustaining care to be withdrawn.

However, the boy's devout Christian parents - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - disagreed.

Today the youngster's father said no-one had the right to take away the 'privilege' of life from his son.

In words that echoed those of the parents of five-year-old cancer victim Ashya King, whose family fled the UK after disagreements with the NHS over his treatment, the baby’s father had said they had been made to feel ‘our child is not our child anymore’ by doctors who gave ‘no consideration’ to their feelings.

Ms Justice Russell analysed the one-year-old boy's case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London today - after an application by the NHS foundation trust which runs the hospital where the youngster is being cared for.

The judge gave the trust permission to withdraw life-sustaining ventilation - and said she had reached the decision 'very sadly' and with 'great reluctance'. 

Ms Justice Russell today thanked the parents for speaking to her and for the 'dignified' way they had conducted themselves.

'This case is unbearably sad,' she said. 'The parents don't agree to the withdrawal of ventilation. They love their son and believe that he responds to them.

'As committed and devout Christians they don't feel they have the right to agree to life-sustaining treatment being withdrawn.

'It is their belief that given time God may work a miracle. I have nothing but sympathy for them and admire the love and devotion they have shown.

'The parents believe in the possibility of recovery. That is not the opinion of the medical experts.' 

She said she had to gauge what was in the little boy's best interests after balancing medical evidence against his parents' views.

Ms Justice Russell ruled neither the boy, his parents nor the trust could be identified. The restriction relating to the naming of the trust would remain in force as long as the boy was alive. 

Lawyer Clare Watson, representing the trust, told Ms Justice Russell that the boy was born prematurely by emergency Caesarean section in 'poor condition' and he required resuscitation and ventilation at birth.

Ms Watson said in late 2013 he had suffered an 'acute cardio-respiratory deterioration', which required him to be 'mechanically ventilated once again'.

She said he was 'ventilator dependent' and his condition had not improved despite 'on-going intensive care'.

Doctors had concluded that there was no prospect of recovery. 

However, Ms Justice Russell also said there had been 'multiple failures in the multi-disciplinary team caring for him' and the boy went into a period of cardiac arrest lasting about 20 minutes.

Ms Watson told the court that an investigation was carried out and said the 'trust have endeavored to be entirely transparent about what has gone wrong'.

Justice Russell accepted that the trust had been transparent and had not 'tried to cover anything up' but said what happened had 'affected the way his parents feel about his treatment - as it would'. 

The boy's mother told Ms Justice Russell: 'At the end of the day he is still alive. The ventilator is helping and supporting that life. Where there is life, I don't think you should get the right to determine whether that should be taken away.'

She said she had seen her son's eyes move and added: 'We believe that (he) does respond to us as parents. We don't feel that the trust has the right to end his life because he has got brain damage.'

The mother said she believed that her son might recover to the point where he could experience the 'pleasures of life'.

'He is still alive,' she told the judge. 'Miracles do happen.'

The boy's father told the judge that no one knew a child better than their mother and father.

He said: 'Even though he is going through all these problems, he still knows ... what is going on. This child still feels. I spend a lot of time with him, talking to him. I know when he is listening ... We know he is reacting to certain things.

'He still has life. We don't have the right, as parents, as individuals, to take this privilege from him.'
