Charges have been filed against two law school students accused of decapitating an exotic bird at a Las Vegas casino before playfully throwing around its severed body to the horror witnesses.

Justin Teixeira, 24, has been charged with felony killing and felony torturing of an animal while Eric Cuellar, 24, faces a misdemeanour charge of instigating, engaging in or furthering an act of animal cruelty.

Police say the students at the University of California, Berkley, were witnessed laughing and throwing around the body of the dead, 14-year-old guineafowl at the Flamingo resort-casino last October.

'I (expletive) killed wildlife,' Teixeira said, according to a report by witnesses obtained by LVRG.com.

The large bird named Turk was part of 
the Flamingo's Wildlife Habitat, a garden area with ponds and streams 
that houses many types of birds.

'This was a cruel and malicious act,' Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said in a statement, adding that an investigation is ongoing and could result in criminal charges against others. 'It is important to hold people accountable for their actions.'

Surveillance video captured the men chasing the bird into some trees, authorities said, and witnesses told police the two emerged carrying the bird's body and severed head.

Richard Schonfeld, an attorney representing Cuellar, said he was pleased prosecutors opted for a lesser charge for his client with the student on track academically to become an attorney himself.

'Eric has an exemplary background and I'm pleased the DA chose to proceed with a misdemeanour,' said Schonfeld, whose client faces up to six months in jail if convicted. 'It's an acknowledgement that he did not physically harm the bird.'

If convicted on all charges, Teixeira could be sentenced to prison time. His attorney did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Thursday afternoon.

Criminal charges - especially felonies - can affect a person's future in the legal field. The State Bar of California, for example, requires applicants to demonstrate good moral character.

A statement on the bar's website notes that people convicted of violent felonies or felonies involving moral turpitude 'are presumed not to be of good moral character in the absence of a pardon or a showing of overwhelming reform and rehabilitation.'

Gina Greisen, the president of Nevada Voters for Animals and an advocate for the state's newly passed, tougher law against animal cruelty, said those potential consequences are appropriate.

Police scene: Police were called to the Flamingo Hotel around 9.30am on October 12 arresting the two men whom police said didn't appear to be on any drugs

'I don't think you should get to be a lawyer if you do something like that,' Greisen said. 'If you are lucky enough to be a Berkeley law student, you know you have to be above reproach in a lot of ways.'

'According to the security people, the men were laughing and joking about the fact of what they had done,' Sgt. John Sheahan of Metro Police told KLAS immediately after the incident on October 12.

Police said they didn't believe drugs were involved.

'Security had allegedly seen these 
men chasing the bird into a brushy treed area of that habitat and then 
coming out of that area with the bird in two pieces,' said Sgt Sheahan.

Witnesses also supported security's claim.
