Two murder suspects and a third inmate who had escaped from a southeast Missouri jail were found hiding on Tuesday in the cab of a truck at a salvage yard, authorities said.

The trio - Matthew Brandon Cook, Kade Reaves Stringfellow and Rodney Joe Green - were taken into custody around 3:30 p.m. without incident, said Missouri Highway Patrol spokesman Trooper Clark Parrott.

One of the men had previously worked at the salvage yard, which was about five miles from the jail.

'The guys who were out there 
searching were doing a systematic search and opened up the cab and there
the three of them were,' Parrott said, adding that all three were 
wearing orange jail-issued shirts and pants but had lost their shoes.

All three men had been jailed 
awaiting trials. Cook and Stringfellow were facing murder charges in 
separate cases, while Green was facing charges for allegedly shooting 
and wounding a couple after breaking into their home.

The men had walked to get to the 
salvage yard just east of Poplar Bluff after escaping around 11:30 p.m. 
Monday through the ceiling of the Butler County Jail. Parrott said 
authorities hadn't received a tip that the men were there.

'It was just, "Hey, where would you 
go if you were on the run?" Someplace familiar,' Parrott said. 'We have 
turned over every rock we could find in Poplar Bluff and southeast 
Butler County today. And that was just one more place for us to go 
look.'

Parrott said the men were being interviewed, and he didn't have any information about new charges.

Sheriff Mark Dobbs said the inmates 
climbed through air ducts to get out. He blamed faulty building design -
walls that donâ€™t extend all the way up to the ceiling - that he said he
and two previous sheriffs had tried to get fixed.

Jail employees discovered that the 
inmates were missing a short time after the escape, said Frank Casteel, 
911 director for Butler County.

Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper
Clark Parrott said the patrol brought in airplanes to aid in the search
that extended as far as Little Rock, Ark.

Cook, 29, is one of two men charged 
with first-degree murder, robbery and other crimes in the February 19 
killing of Bernie, Missouri, man Sean Crow, 34, in a McDonald's parking 
lot.

Cook allegedly sent a text message to 
the victim using the cellphone of a woman they both knew, asking Crow to
meet at the restaurant.

Crow was found slumped over in his 
pickup truck the next day, dead of a single shot to the head from a 
.22-caliber pistol. Surveillance video helped lead police to Cook and a 
man who was with him.

Stringfellow,
23, of Portageville, is charged with second-degree murder in the July 
death of his infant son, Karson Stringfellow.

According
to court documents, medical workers became suspicious due to the 
child's injuries and inconsistent statements by Stringfellow, who 
claimed he had slipped and fallen while holding his son.

Doctors
at St. Louis Children's Hospital determined the child had bleeding in 
the brain and both eyes, and multiple fractured ribs and other injuries 
that they believed were the result of abuse.

Green, 33, is facing multiple charges for allegedly breaking into a rural Butler County home in February, holding a husband and wife at gunpoint, then shooting them after a struggle before getting away with their pickup truck.

The man was struck in the thigh and his wife was shot in the hand. Both survived.

Green was captured days later after a state trooper spotted him driving on a rural road and gave chase. The chase ended when Green's car struck a utility pole and a tree.
