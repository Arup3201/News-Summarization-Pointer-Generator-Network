Maybe one day, when his dotage is upon him, Ronny Deila will reflect on this night as the moment it all changed for him as the manager of Celtic.

In seeing off a decent but hardly dynamic Romanian side, the Norwegian took the old wisdom that you’d rather be lucky than good to the extreme.

His side were far from good here, barely even mediocre. Yet, crucially, they won. And with the door to the knock-out stages of the Europa League now wide open, the man who succeeded Neil Lennon  three months ago now has more than hope to cling to.

Deila spoke before the game of the need to build momentum, to aim not just to win their next game and make it four wins in a row, but to claim 10 successive victories.

Statistically, they remain on course for such an achievement but frankly the whipping boys of Group D - Astra are bottom with no points - will long wonder why they didn’t puncture that hope.

The central Europeans found Celtic in the most generous of moods here. It took Deila’s side long enough to create anything of real substance but even when they did they were wasteful.

At times Stefan Scepovic's finishing was so poor that he must have wished that a hole would open up in the centre circle into which he could crawl.

Yet to the Serb’s credit, he didn’t stop trying. He was rewarded with his first goal in a Celtic shirt which laid the foundation for the most unconvincing of victories.

Stefan Johansen had the Parkhead crowd rubbing their eyes in disbelief by claiming a second soon after but Astra at least made their hosts sweat for the win with a consolation through Gabriel Enache.

Celtic got over the line but the free-flowing football Deila speaks of must materialize soon.

After three months of agonising over his team selection, the manager finally stumbled across a scenario that presented few dilemmas.

Fresh from a thumping of Ross County on Saturday, the Norwegian’s only minor concern was who would fill the ineligible John Guidetti’s boots but Scepovic was always the front-runner for that task.

On the kind of Glasgow night that would have ducks seeking shelter, the closure of the upper-tier was a constant reminder of how bland a serving the Europa League is when the taste of the Champions League is still lingering on the palate.

What a difference an early goal would have made to the subdued atmosphere and what a chance Charlie Mulgrew passed up to claim it just five minutes in.

Picked out superbly by Anthony Stokes’ deep corner, the midfielder was granted the freedom of Parkhead by the Romanians. But his header didn’t remotely concern Silviu Lung in the Astra goal.

Seidu Yahaya was one of two Astra players who almost failed to make the trip due to visa problems yet there was no excusing the lateness of his arrival to challenge Mikael Lustig deep in his own half, the result, a deserved caution for catching the Swede on the ankle.

With just one win in their last eight games, Astra’s policy of keeping 10 men behind the ball when possible was understandable. Yet Celtic’s inability to make any headway from open play in the opening quarter of the game was stark.

And, having kept the Scots at arm’s length for long enough, Oleg Protasov’s side began to jab.

What Craig Gordon knew of Yahaya’s venomous, dipping volley from 20 yards out, only he truly knows. The fact the ball thundered off the keeper’s chest suggested his save was more down to a stroke of good fortune than anything else.

There was no mystery about Gordon’s next involvement just seconds later. Astra skipper Constantin Budescu stole half a yard on a static defence and looked certain to sweep the visitors ahead until the keeper’s outstretched leg foiled him.

At this stage in the game, Celtic’s defence was something of a misnomer. When William Amorim prodded a short pass between Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer, they were in different postcodes. Its recipient, Takayuki Seto, rightfully chastised himself for firing a gilt-edged chance weakly beyond the far post.

When Lustig’s whipped cross almost forced Vasileios Pliatsikas into a spectacular own-goal, Celtic Park briefly threatened to find its voice again. Yet Charlie Mulgrew’s kamikaze pass across his own box to Gabriel Enache seconds later drew more groans.

On 38 minutes, Scepovic failed to connect cleanly with Lustig’s cross leaving Lung again unworked from a header. However, the Serb did tee up Stokes with the last action of the first half only for the Irishman to be thwarted by a timely block by Pliatsikas.

That late flurry did nothing to shelter Deila’s men from a chorus of jeers as they traipsed back up the tunnel to reflect on a display described by Parkhead icon Chris Sutton as ‘pathetic’.

After the break, Mulgrew was again at fault with a wayward pass from deep that resulted in Seto catching sight of the whites of Gordon’s eyes. Only Emilio Izaguirre’s late intervention stopped a certain goal.

Then, twice in quick succession Scepovic latched onto excellent crosses from Lustig and Izaguirre no more than six yards out. Both opportunities were missed with the only debate surrounding which one was the more glaring.

Aleksandar Tonev was sprung from the bench to replace Callum McGregor just before the hour mark and rippled the side-netting with an ambitious strike.Wakaso soon joined him with Mulgrew unsurprisingly making way. 

Astra understandably began to fancy their chances. Gordon remained rooted to the spot when Junior Morais sent a long throw into the box and Cristian Oros headed just over.

Yet, just as the notion crossed the mind that a solitary point might not be a disaster for Deila, his side seized all three in a remarkable five-minute burst.

Wakaso won the crucial free-kick on the left flank on 73 minutes that also cost Oros a booking. Stokes’ pin-point delivery arrowed towards Scepovic and the Serb felt the weight of the world rise from his shoulders as his towering header beat Lung.

Having laboured all night, Celtic were pinching themselves just five minutes later with the arrival of the second.

The hitherto solid Lung spilled Tonev’s routine cross straight into the path of Johansen and the Norwegian gleefully rattled the loose ball high into the net from 12 yards.

Deila’s was only allowed two moments of relative calm, though. Enache appeared to use his arm to finish off a scrappy move but the arrears were halved nonetheless and it was a nervous last 10 minutes for his side.

Neither Beram Kayal, Celtic’s final substitute, nor Scepovic could put the home fans out of their misery as they squandered late chances but they hung on. Just.
