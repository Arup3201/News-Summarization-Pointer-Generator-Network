The intricate and winding landscape of the world’s tallest mountain has been captured from space.

Mount Everest’s snow-covered peaks are seen in stark contrast against the brown and barren landscape in this Nasa Earth Observatory satellite image.

It is one of 14 mountain peaks on Earth that stand taller than 26,000ft (8,000m) and the local Nepalese name for it is Sagarmatha, which means 'mother of the universe.'

This clear aerial view of Mount  Everest's peak was captured last month as Nasa's Earth Observatory satellite orbited over Nepal. It is one of 14 mountain peaks on Earth that stand taller than 26,000ft and the local Nepalese name for it is Sagarmatha, which means 'mother of the universe'

Mount Everest: 29,035ft (8,850m)

K2: 28,253ft (8,612m)

Kangchenjunga: 28,169ft (8,586m)

Lhotse:  27,890ft (8,501m)

Makalu:  27,765ft (8,462 m)

Cho Oyu: 26,906ft (8,201 m)

Dhaulagiri: 26,794ft (8,167m)

Manaslu: 26,758ft (8,156m)

Nanga Parbat: 26,658ft (8,125m)

Annapurna: 26,545ft (8,091m)

Gasherbrum I: 26,470ft (8,068m)

Broad Peak: 26,400ft (8,047m)

Gasherbrum II: 26,360ft (8,035m)

Shishapangma: 26,289ft (8,013m)

Mount Everest is the tallest of these so-called ‘eight-thousanders’ and is the standard to which all other mountains are compared.

All 14 of them are found in China, Pakistan or Nepal.

Everest’s geological story began 40 million years ago when the Indian subcontinent began a slow-motion collision with Asia.

The edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the Himalayas today.  

Glaciers have chiselled Mount Everest’s summit into a huge, triangular pyramid, defined by three faces and three ridges that extend to the northeast, southeast, and northwest.

The southeastern ridge is the most widely used climbing route.

It is the one Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay followed in May 1953 when they became the first climbers to reach the summit and return safely.

Despite its reputation as an extremely dangerous mountain, commercial guiding has done much to improve the safety of the Everest ascent.  

As of March 2012, there had been 5,656 successful ascents of Everest, although 223 people had died at fatality rate of 4 per cent.

The satellite image was taken in December, just weeks after Nasa captured the rivers of black lava snaking over the snow-covered slopes of the stratovolcano Mount Etna in Sicily.
