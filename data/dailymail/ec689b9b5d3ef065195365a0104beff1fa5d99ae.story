The Prime Minister has drawn a line in the sand with students and youth unemployed today, telling them to 'pull your weight' as he made it clear there will be no softening of the government's Work for the Dole program.

'I want to see every Australian pulling his or her weight. That's very important,' Mr Abbott said.

There was an outcry from students and welfare groups after the May Budget, when Treasurer Joe Hockey announced the overhaul of Work for the Dole and unemployment benefits.

An angry St Vincent de Paul Society CEO Dr John Falzon said: 'You don't help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don't help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive'

But the Prime Minister fired another salvo today.

'The last thing we want is to see young people leaving school and going on to unemployment benefits,' the Prime Minister said.

St Vincent de Paul Society CEO, Dr John Falzon, hit back: 'What we had hoped for was a jobs plan, what we have got instead is a bashing the young unemployed plan.'

The PM said that school leavers did not have to rely on the dole 'particularly when there is going to be a stronger training system and more effective system in the future, than there has been in the past.'

He said the government has missed the point and the labour market structure is the problem, not those seeking work.

'You don't help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don't help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive,' Dr Falzon added.

The PM said that school leavers did not have to rely on the dole 'particularly when there is going to be a stronger training system and more effective system in the future, than there has been in the past.'

From the start of 2015, new job-seekers under the age of 30 will have to wait up to six months before receiving unemployment benefits.

Further, they will then have to participate in at least 25 hours per week under Work for the Dole, to receive any payments for the next six months.

'The problem is structural but the government insists on using the language of demonising and blame to the very people who are suffering the affects of that structure,' Dr Falzon added.

A national day of action is planned by tertiary students to protest against the Work for the Dole changes and education overhaul.
