Leeds and England captain Kevin Sinfield has called time on his international career with immediate effect.

The Oldham-born loose forward, who will turn 34 later this month, has won 26 England caps and 14 Great Britain caps, and appeared in the last three World Cups.

He admitted the decision to retire ahead of this season's Four Nations in Australia and New Zealand, had been a wrench.

Calling it quits: Leeds captain has announced his retirement from international rugby league

'This is a decision I have taken a great deal of time over and it has been the toughest of my professional career,' he said.

'I have always loved playing for my country, whether for England or Great Britain, and it has been a privilege and honour to lead my country for the last two seasons.

'What has made the process easier is the knowledge that the environment Steve McNamara has created will continue the progress we have made in the last few seasons.'
