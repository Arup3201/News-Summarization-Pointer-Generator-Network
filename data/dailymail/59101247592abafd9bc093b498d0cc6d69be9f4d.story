She claims that she does 
'nothing' to prepare for her catwalk appearances due to a hectic work 
schedule, but size 6 Cara Delevingne always looks incredibly slim on the catwalk.

And now
the 5ft 9in model of the year has given girls worldwide even more 
reason to envy her after taking to Instagram to showcase her 'fashion week diet' of McDonald's burgers and chips.

The 21-year-old posted a photo of herself and fellow model Jourdan Dunn with giant bags from the fast food chain with the caption: 'My food is faster than yours!!! #fashionweekdietplan.'

Speaking to style website Beauty High last year, Cara said: 'I need to eat a lot otherwise I feel 
faint. I get in the worst moods if I don’t eat'.

And it seems she isn't the only genetically-blessed model that loves a good calorie-laden meal; Jourdan Dunn is a big fast food fan too, citing her favourite meal as fried hot chicken wings.

See, models DO eat! Jourdan Dunn was spotted tucking into a Nando's backstage at Topshop Unique yesterday and Cara even dressed up as her favourite food

Fry up: In Jourdan's latest cookery show she can seen frying chicken wings

On her cooking show Well
Dunn, which 
appears on Jay-Z‘s Life + Times YouTube channel, Dunn is often seen cooking up her favourite meal in the deep fat fryer.

And proving that she doesn't live on a diet of lettuce and water during fashion week, Dunn was spotted backstage yesterday at Topshop Unique devouring Nando's chicken wings whilst she was in hair and make-up.

Speaking on her cookery show, she said: 'I always get so excited cooking chicken wings.

How do they do it? Despite feasting on fast food behind the scenes, Cara and Jourdan looked super slim on the catwalk yesterday

'I
don’t know, because it’s chicken wings! I don’t know anyone who doesn’t
like chicken wings. You say chicken wings and everyone’s like "What, 
what? Chicken wings? I’m there."

'Chicken wings and beer, chicken and beer. Perfect.'

Contrary to popular belief that models live in fear of carbs, the models were making the most of the free food at fashion week, devouring ham and cheese sandwiches and blueberry muffins backstage at Topshop Unique and chocolate lollipops at Matthew Williamson yesterday.

Guests eat too: Fish and chips with tartare sauce and Eton mess were served for those attending the Topshop Unique show yesterday
