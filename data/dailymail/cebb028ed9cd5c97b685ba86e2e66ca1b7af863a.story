Casey Anthony has been spotted eating out at a steak house in South Florida, it was claimed on Tuesday.

A blurry cell phone photo shows a woman believed to be Anthony, 26, with a basket of hot wings and fries at  Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill in Lake Worth.

It is Anthony's first public appearance since she was acquitted of murdering her young daughter Caylee. The trial in 2011, and photos of her partying and drinking while Caylee was missing, have made her 'the most hated mom in America.'

Is it her? A woman reported to be Casey Anthony was seen eating out at a steakhouse in Lake Worth, Florida, on Friday. Gossip Extra was the first to report the possible sighting

Murdered: Caylee Anthony, pictured with Casey, was not yet three years old when she disappeared from Orlando, Florida, in 2008

RadarOnline reports that sources have confirmed that the woman seen in the photo is indeed Anthony.

In the picture, the woman is seen wearing a white knitted hat over her dark hair, as well as a
white blouse and beige cardigan.

She is seen sitting next to an 
unidentified bald man. Regular customer of the restaurant said they don't know 
the man and had never seen him before.

Gossip Extra  reports that Pat 
McKenna, a private investigator who worked on Anthony's case and also 
help clear OJ Simpson, was seated across from her.

McKenna is not seen in the photo, but reportedly paid for the meal with a credit card under his name.

Gossip Extra claims the photo, taken Friday, is possible proof that Anthony is hiding out in South Florida.

Anthony has long been rumored to be in Palm Beach, near Lake Worth, but it has never been confirmed.

Jose Lambiet, the founder of Gossip Extra, has offered a $1,000 bounty for 'irrefutable proof' that she is living in Palm Beach County.

Night out: Anthony went to this outpost Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill in Lake Worth, Florida, which is part of a South Florida restaurant chain

If the woman at the table is Casey Anthony, she appears to be taking precautions before going out in public.

One of the men when into the restaurant ahead of her and waited for a table about 7pm Friday.

The woman, claimed to be Anthony, only came inside once the table was ready.

In hiding: Anthony's whereabouts are unknown and she reportedly does not leave her home

Gossip Extra reports that tipsters at 
Flanigan's said the woman never said a word to the waiters and only 
spoke to her companions in hushed tones.

Casey reportedly ordered Buffalo chicken wings, her bald friend dined on lemon chicken and Mr McKenna had shrimp.

Flanigan's refused to confirm whether Anthony dined there on Friday.

'There's
a bunch of stink about that, and it doesn’t seem to be doing anybody 
any good, so we’re not going to comment one way or the other,' a manager who refused to give his name told MailOnline. 

Previously,
Anthony's only known contact with the outside world was a series of 
photos of herself and a video she posted on social networking sites.

Anthony
was on probation after an unrelated check fraud conviction, but that 
sentence ended in August - leaving her a free woman.

'No one wants to be associated with Casey, it's just such bad publicity,' a source told Radar Online. 'She was really quiet and not that many people were noticing it was her.'

Caylee disappeared in July 2008, shortly before her third birthday. She was not reported missing for 31 days, until Casey's grandparents discovered Casey's car had a strong odor of decomposition. 

In hiding: Anthony has only been seen since the trial in videos and photos she posted of herself on social networking sites online, like the one pictured here

Big name: Patrick McKenna, a private investigator who worked on the Casey Anthony case and also helped the OJ Simpson defense team, was reportedly with Anthony on Friday

During the time her daughter was missing, Casey partied with friends and participated in a 'hot body' contest at an Orlando nightclub.

Caylee's body was found bound and gagged in a garbage bag in a swamp in December 11 - just a few miles from the Orlando home of Casey's parents.

During the trial, prosecutors argued the Casey killed her daughter because she was a burden to her social life.

However, Casey's parents testified in her favor and a jury acquitted her of nearly all charged in June 2011.

Tragic: Caylee wasn't reported missing for 31 days. Photos emerged of Casey partying while Caylee was apparently dead
