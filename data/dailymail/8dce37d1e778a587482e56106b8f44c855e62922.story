Confidential documents leaked from Tigerair Australia reveal safety concerns including pilots being issued incorrect flight plans and ‘threatening behaviour’ occurring between crews and other workers.

The report prepared for the budget airline’s management shows the crew on the Airbus A320 flight, which was carrying 177 passengers from Sydney to Perth March 3, were inaccurately informed that the aircraft didn’t have any people on board therefore needing less fuel, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

‘This meant that all the supplied flight plan calculations were based on a flight 14,660kgs lighter than the actual aircraft weight,’ the April 1 report stated.

Tigerair and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau have launched investigations into the incident after the pilots are reported to have discovered the serious error.

It is understood that although the aircraft landed with enough fuel in reserve to meet the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's requirements, it may not have met the airline's minimum standards.

The document also divulges that Tiger chief pilot Harry Holling emailed all other fellow pilots last month to warn them about recent reports of crew having ‘heated discussions’ with other staff while on line.

‘There is no place for yelling, aggressive or threatening behaviour… this applies to radio transmissions as well as face to face communication,’ the email stated.

The recent collision between the hydro-tow bar and the Tigerair plane was also highlighted in the report with the company’s safety bulletin revealing that the tug driver has no ‘verbal link’ with the flight crew or dispatcher. 

Tigerair is conducting its own investigation into the incident after management reported the collision to the ATSB which decided not to investigate further.

However, Tigerair Australia strongly refutes the allegations made in the article published in Saturday’s Fairfax media.

'Safety was not compromised in any of the incidents mentioned and each of these have been managed as part of Tigerair’s robust Safety Management System reporting processes,' a statement said.

'Safety is Tigerair’s number one priority and we have strict procedures in place to ensure the highest standards of safety are maintained at all time.'
