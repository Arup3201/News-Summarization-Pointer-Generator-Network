She's one of the most powerful women in British television, and her shows Last Tango In Halifax and Happy Valley are watched by devoted audiences of millions.

But the Bafta-winning writer Sally Wainwright says the viewer she tries hardest to please is her mother Dorothy.

Interviewed for today’s edition of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, she says of her mother: ‘I often listen to my mum. She is the person I write for.’

Triumph: Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi in the hit BBC1 series Last Tango in Halifax

Dorothy keeps a particularly close eye on Last Tango In Halifax because it is loosely based on her own life. 

Starring Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi, the BBC1 comedy-drama follows the fortunes of two childhood sweethearts who fall in love again when they meet by chance when they are in their 70s.

Dorothy herself married her childhood sweetheart, Alec Walker, after they met again years later online.

Wainwright says her mother has reservations about the series, which led to the writer’s Bafta success last year, adding: ‘She worries that people will take it all a bit too literally. 

Obviously I made a lot up – you have to because you have to fill six hours. My mum met Alec online and they completely fell in love with each other and it was all beautiful but that doesn’t make great drama. You need things to go wrong before the drama can kick in.’

Wainwright, who worked for 18 months as a bus driver, says her mother came to her rescue when she got her first big break writing for The Archers. 

She says: ‘I didn’t know anything about it, I am ashamed to say. My mum gave me a crash course on who everybody was and she took me through all the storylines and helped me construct my story for my trial script.’

Wainwright, whose shows also include the ITV detective series Scott And Bailey and the comedy drama At Home With The Braithwaites, says that researching the darker themes in her shows can leave her feeling depressed. 

She adds: ‘Murder isn’t entertainment. It’s horrible, real and disgusting. I don’t know how detectives work. I couldn’t do what they do.’

The TV drama Rock Follies Of 77 has perhaps had the biggest influence on her career, Wainwright says, and the song The Band Who Wouldn’t Die from the 1970s show is one of her music choices.
