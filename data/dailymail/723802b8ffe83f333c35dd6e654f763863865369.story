A dedicated Seattle Seahawks fan shaved the left side of her head and had the team's logo etched on it to win football tickets - but lost to a man dressed as Batman.

McKenzie Jane Brown, 28,  got inked after hearing radio station 97 Rock was giving away two tickets to last 
week's divisional playoff game in Seattle to the fan with the best 
Seahawks-related photo.

Not holding back, the hairstylist asked her tattoo-artist husband to plaster the hawk silhouette on top of the number '12' - 
symbolizing the fan base - over her scalp.

'I always wanted to have a Seahawks tattoo, but I didn't want a logo to interrupt the other tattoos,' the heavily tattooed woman said. 'That's why I felt the head would be perfect.'

Tri-City Herald reported Brown has been a Seahawks fan since she 
was young, but has never been to a game in person.

But to her disappointment, she lost the competition to Braiden Sanders who dressed in a Seahawks-themed Batman costume and attracted more votes than her.

'I came in second, but nothing else 
changed,' Brown, who already had nine tattoos, said. 'I may have a little bit of an itchy head, but I'm 
still loud and proud.'

Brown's husband, Matthew Brown, is an artist at Parkway Tattoo in Richland.

The passionate woman plans to keep the tattoo 
exposed until the Super Bowl, then grow
 her hair back. She will shave it again in the fall for the 2014 season.

The tattoo symbolizes the 12th man, which is the nickname for the Seahawks' rowdy fans who are considered to be like an extra player on the field.

However, Brown refuses to give up her dream of watching the NFL live.

Her friend has submitted a video of her getting the tattoo to the Ellen DeGeneres Show in a bid to get Super Bowl tickets.

The video shows footage of Brown's long black hair being shaved and her head being tattooed.

It also included an offer to get an 'Ellen' tattoo on the other side of her head if she won but she didn't hear back from the show.

She has also appeared on numerous television programs, including the Today Show, after becoming an internet sensation.
