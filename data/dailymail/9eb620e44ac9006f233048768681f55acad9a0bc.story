Marriage is ‘the most important man-made institution’ and it is right to recognise it with a new tax break, Iain Duncan Smith said yesterday.

The Work and Pensions Secretary, the Cabinet’s leading proponent of a transferable tax allowance to reduce the tax bills of stay-at-home and part-time spouses, said the move would help return ‘fairness to hard-pressed families’.

A poll yesterday showed overwhelming support for the Government’s plans to introduce a £1,000 allowance from April 2015, which are being fiercely opposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. A YouGov poll for the Sun found that 62 per cent of people back the idea, with just 20 per cent against.

‘The greatest thing we can do to help stabilise families and support commitment and nature is to back the most important man-made institution of marriage through a transferable tax allowance,’ Mr Duncan Smith said.

Britain's Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith says marriage must be respected and supported

‘This is a brilliant move and gives fairness to hardworking families.’

David Cameron, who first promised to introduce a tax break for married couples when he ran for the Conservative leadership in 2005, is expected to use his speech to the conference today to reaffirm his belief that it is right for the state to recognise the institution once more.

The Government will allow one member of a married couple who earns under the £10,000 income tax threshold to transfer £1,000 of their allowance to their spouse, reducing their tax bill by up to £200 a year, as long as they are one of the 24 million basic rate taxpayers. Around 3.4 million couples are expected to benefit.

Mr Duncan Smith said: '¿Marriage is a great institution. Marriage helps to build commitment and society and should have recognition in the tax system'

The Prime Minister suggested yesterday that a majority Conservative government would seek to go further, and extend the measure to more couples if it wins power in 2015.

‘It is not an expensive move. It is very much a first step,’ he said. ‘Marriage is a great institution. Marriage helps to build commitment and society and should have recognition in the tax system.

‘This policy isn’t about the money but about the message that people who make a lasting commitment should be recognised in some way.’

Labour MPs stepped up their attack on the proposal yesterday. Ilford MP Mike Gapes said: ‘It will take the country back to the 1950s rather than dealing with the world as it is today.

'They are basically telling children that some families are less deserving and some kinds of families are better to grow up in than others.’

Harriet Harman, Labour’s deputy leader, said the tax break was ‘stigmatising and moralising’, and shadow Treasury minister Rachel Reeves called it a ‘policy about division’.

Ministers argue couples were actively penalised under Labour’s tax and benefits system, while two-earner couples are entitled to taxpayer-subsidised childcare. The Government plans to introduce a new childcare tax break in 2015.

In his speech to the conference, Mr Duncan Smith also hailed the Government’s plan to force benefits claimants to spend 35 hours a week doing community work or in a job centre will end the ‘something for nothing culture’.

Under the Work Programme, private sector organisations and charities have been tasked with helping the unemployed find a job. And last week, Chancellor George Osborne announced the Help to Work scheme, which will force the long-term unemployed to do community volunteering from next year if they want to claim their benefits.

Those who break the rules of the Help to Work scheme, for example by failing to turn up for duty without a good reason, could lose their benefit for four weeks. A second offence would see them lose it for three months.

Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One that Britain could learn from Germany when it came to profiling unemployed people and finding out who needed the most help to get back in to work. He said the measures being announced were part of the attempts to give people a sense of a daily job.
