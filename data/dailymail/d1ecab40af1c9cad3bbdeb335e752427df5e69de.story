Charged: Folk musician Roy Harper has been accused of molesting a 12-year-old girl in the 1970s

Celebrated folk musician Roy Harper is to be charged with nine child sex offences over claims he abused a 12-year-old girl in the 1970s.

The 72-year-old singer-songwriter was questioned by police at Heathrow in February, and now faces charges of indecent assault and gross indecency.

He will appear in court on Monday to be formally charged.

Harper, who lives in Ireland, has released more than 30 folk rock albums, performed with Pink Floyd and had a Led Zeppelin song named after him.

He is alleged to have molested a pre-pubescent girl in Herefordshire multiple times between 1975 and 1977, when he was at the height of his fame.

West Mercia Police said in a statement: 'Roy Harper, of Rossmore, Clonakilty, County Cork, has been summonsed before Hereford Magistrates on 18 November to face nine sexual offences charges.

'The summons was issued to the musician on 16 October after he was voluntarily interviewed by police at Heathrow airport on 22 February.

'The summons relates to two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, three counts of indecent assault on a girl under 14 and four counts of gross indecency with a girl under 14.'

Harper is the latest celebrity to be accused of historic sex offences, following the revelations about disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile.

However, the charges against him are not related to Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police investigation set up in the wake of the scandal.

Album: Harper, 72, released Man & Myth in September; he has made more than 30 records

He has continued to perform since his the claims emerged, playing sold out shows in London, Manchester and Bristol last month, and released a new album in September.

The singer's influence on the world of folk rock was recognised by MOJO magazine in 2005 when they awarded him a 'Hero Award'.

Harper has been closely associated with a number of leading musicians and bands during his 50-year career.

He sang lead vocals on Have a Cigar by Pink Floyd in 1975, and inspired a 1970 song by Led Zeppelin, Hats Off to (Roy) Harper.

Other celebrities to have been charged with historic sex offences this year include entertainer Rolf Harris, publicist Max Clifford and DJ Dave Lee Travis.
