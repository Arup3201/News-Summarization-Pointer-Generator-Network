Thrifty consumers with an eye for a bargain can score a pair of jeans for as little as seven dollars.

Australia’s leading retailers such as Big W, Kmart and Target have all engaged in a mighty battle to offer the cheapest denim at rock-bottom prices.

But how are these three major discount giants able to make and sell jeans so cheaply?

A Target Spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that customers can buy a pair of jeans 'safe in the knowledge that they've been produced in an ethically sustainable manner'.

'Our $10 jeans are produced by a single factory in China, which has been audited to meet all our ethical sourcing requirements around worker pay, safety and conditions,' he said.

'Placing large order volumes with a single factory means the supplier benefits from economies of scale, and can give our customers a great quality product at a terrific price, without compromising Target’s ethical sourcing standards.'

Kmart's classic jeans are on special for $7 after a price drop from $8 on July 13th 2014

Daily Mail Australia contacted Kmart and Big W for comment but they have not yet responded.

Fashion expert Stephanie Cunningham, from Sydney, told Daily Mail Australia that the seven dollar jeans are of low quality and a representation of wasteful 'fast fashion'.

'They will not last long and you get what you pay for,' she said.

'The idea of ‘fast fashion’ is that the product will only last a short amount of time, sending you back to buy their cheap jeans over and over again.

'In the long run you may end up spending more money on lots of cheap jeans, compared to buying two pairs of more expensive high quality jeans.

'If the jeans are made in Australia, they are more likely to be a higher price due to higher wages, but it is also easier to monitor quality. Overseas, it varies greatly, depending on company standards.'

Fashion designer Betty Tran, from Western Australia, told Daily Mail Australia that consumers should do more research.

'People need to be careful about the quality because you don't know if it's going to damage your health,' she said.

'We don't know what's going through in the process and how the dye is being treated.

'I know it's hard to find things made in Australia but if dye starts coming off after you soak your clothes in a bucket of water - you know it's not really good for you.

'It's important that consumers be active and ask questions from their retailers and know where they're made from before purchasing.'

Every woman needs that perfect-fitting pair of jeans and it goes without saying that being comfortable in your jeans is the most important thing.

But when it comes to cheap jeans costing from $7, which pair should you settle on? Daily Mail Australia reporter Cindy Tran put the cheap jeans to the test.

Kmart Classic Jeans $7

Kmart ticked all the boxes and were the best pair of jeans out of all three retailers. I was surprised at how amazing they felt. They offer the perfect fit and sit well from my waist down to my legs. They're probably by far one of the most comfortable jeans I've ever worn and it made my legs look and feel slim plus the material was gentle on the skin. They're definitely a pair that would go well with everything and a must-have for your wardrobe.

Target Everyday Jeans $10

Target were the most expensive and offer a good fit and a versatile style that work any time of the year. I did find them a bit  tight around my knees because they sit so snugly around my legs. But you can't go wrong with a pair of $10 jeans and they got my vote for the best coloured denim out of the three.

Big W Emerson Jeans $7

Big W's jeans were my least favourite. They fit from the waist to the knees then break into a slight flare for a balanced, feminine profile, which is great for that chic 70s look. But they made my legs look and feel wider.

A Current Affair tested the durability of all three jeans by putting them through 10 cycles in the washing machine.

Look Smart Alteration tailor Rabie Mtanos, from Bondi Junction, told A Current Affair that a slight colour fade and some shrinkage was found on the Big W pair.

Target jeans shrunk a lot more but kept their colour the best.

While the Kmart pair had obvious results - they faded slightly, as well as shrinking after 10 washes.

Oxfam spokeswoman Kelly Dent told Daily Mail Australia that consumers need to ask themselves whether workers are paid enough to produce garments this cheap.

‘It’s concerning to see garments at such a low price. It’s not the prices that we should be worried about but it’s whether these companies are respecting workers' rights, conditions and their safety,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

‘If you look at a country like Cambodia, 33 percent of their workers are malnourished because they’re not paid enough to live on and can’t eat properly.

‘I’m not talking about an extravagant lifestyle but how can these workers afford a roof over their head, nutrient foods, as well as small savings for weddings, funerals and even a holiday.

‘It doesn’t necessarily mean that when we pay $80 for a pair of jeans that workers are paid more but when it comes to $7, the chances of exploitation do increase.’

Kmart ticked all the boxes for the best and cheapest pair of jeans out of all three retailers, according to Daily Mail Australia reporter Cindy Tran

Target Australia has published a list of its supplier factories in Bangladesh to ensure transparency and safe working conditions in its overseas supplier factories

Ms Dent said the minimum wage in Cambodia is $100 per month but the living wage is $450.

‘Just recently, there was a striking protest from these garment workers who wanted an increase to $170 per month but it’s still not enough to live on.

‘Consumers who ask themselves “can I make a difference?” need to know that they should never doubt if they can make an impact on people because companies do listen.'

K-mart, Big W and Target have signed up to the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety to ensure that all garment factories in Bangladesh are safe.

The accord  was established in 2013 after the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh collapsed in April last year, killing more than 1100 workers.

‘These are all small steps and they lead to results but more needs to be done,’ Ms Dent said.

Target Australia has also released a statement that the list will ensure transparency and safe working conditions in its overseas supplier factories.

Target Managing Director Stuart Machin said supply chain transparency was key to Target’s commitment to improving working conditions and safety standards in Bangladesh and other sourcing countries.

‘We have a responsibility to ensure that everyone who works for our business, whether directly or indirectly is safe in their workplace,’ Mr Machin said.

‘This is also a key concern for our customers who want to know that the products they purchase from Target are sourced and produced ethically.’

Target was one of the first Australian retailers to sign the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety, and also one of the first Australian retailers to publicly commit to publishing details of its factory suppliers.

‘We hope that our presence in Bangladesh and other developing countries can be a catalyst for improving the lives of workers,’ Mr Machin said.
