Timothy William Maness, 28, admitted to recording young women through their bedroom windows at the University of California, Santa Cruz 

A peeping tom admitted to recording young women through their bedroom windows at a California university after a victim snapped a photograph of him and posted it all over the neighborhood. 

Timothy William Maness, 28, turned himself in on Thursday at the Santa Cruz Police Station. 

He admitted he was the man in the photographs taken by a young woman on Tuesday after he looked through her bedroom window and attempted to enter her home.

Haley Woolford, 19, said Maness removed panels from her backyard fence and walked through the gap to enter the private patio area. 

The University of California, Santa Cruz student spotted Maness as he opened her bedroom window and reached through it to try and enter the residence, according to police.

That's when Woolford pointed a flashlight at Maness and screamed before running out of the house to confront him. 

'He realized he was caught and said some stuff, then he told me his excuse was his hat had fallen in my backyard,' Woolford told KSBW.  

Woolford then yelled at Maness to get off her property and snapped five photographs of him as 'he walked away calmly,' she said. 

The student made fliers with the suspect's picture and posted them throughout the neighborhood. Police also helped distribute the fliers and the photographs were published by local media outlets.

Police said Maness first denied that he had been peeping on Woolford but admitted after an extensive interview that he 'enjoyed video recording or photographing females from outside their residences'. 

Maness was charged with burglary, stalking, peeping and video recording while peeping.  

Many UC Santa Cruz students live in the complex where Woolford resides and Maness had been spotted in the neighborhood before.

Police had been trying to track him down for the last four to six weeks. But victims had only heard Maness or reported seeing the top of his head or lower limbs.
