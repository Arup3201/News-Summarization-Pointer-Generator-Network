Police in Aruba have staged a dramatic reconstruction of American tourist Robyn Gardner's final moments in an attempt finally to discover how she disappeared.

Actors dressed as Miss Gardner and her vacation partner Gary Giordano, who she is said to have met on a swingers website, yesterday were seen on the beach where she went missing, playing out different scenarios to work out how likely they are to have happened.

Giordano, 50, is the only suspect being 
questioned in relation to the
disappearance of Gardner, 35, who has been missing since August 2. The 
older man
is being held in custody for 60 days, but police need
more evidence to charge him with murder.

Reconstruction: Actors play out Miss Gardner's final steps in an attempt to solve the crime

Footage showed actors arriving at the beach in the vehicle the pair had rented while in Aruba. The actress playing Miss Gardner was wearing a dress just like the one Miss Gardner was last seen in.

The actor playing Mr Giordano could then be seen running from the water to report his friend missing.

Mr Giordano was asked to participate in the reconstruction of events but declined.

His lawyer, Jose Baez, told MSNBC the move was 'desperate' because they lack any concrete evidence.

'The solicitor general has come out publicly saying we're doing this to shoot holes in his story. When all else fails and you reach the level of desperation that's what they decide to do,' he said.

Images which emerged from Aruba yesterday showed Miss Gardner out in Aruba with murder suspect Gary Giordano just two days before she vanished.

In the photographs of the two out dancing, Miss Gardner is wearing the same long dress she wore on the day of her disappearance.

'The
whole key of re-enactments is to try to go back and first of all 
understand and be clear about the movements of people prior to a 
criminal act occurring,' retired FBI profiler Brad Garrett told ABC 
News.

'Now, unfortunately, in this case you don't have a crime scene to eventually end your re-enactment.'

Giordano and Gardner were last seen leaving a restaurant - the Rum Reef Bar & Grill at Baby Beach - at about 4pm on August 2.

Two hours later, Giordano is seen alone on security camera, wearing no top but with his toupee still in place.

He reported his companion missing, 
saying she had drowned while snorkelling. Giordano was arrested as he 
later tried to flee the country.

Shocking surveillance video from the 
day before Robyn Gardner disappeared shows her being led by Giordano to 
the stretch of beach from which she would vanish a day later, in what experts believe could have been a test run before she was murdered.

The footage
shows the Toyota Rav-4 which the pair had rented parked in the same 
spot it would be left on the day of Robyn's disappearance.

Other
shots show them walking near the restaurant where they shared their 
last meal on the following day. The video was taken at 3.41pm, around 
the same time of day she vanished a day later.

Officers
having been tracing the movements of Giordano in the hours before Ms 
Gardner's disappearance, but said they have had trouble identifying him 
in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees.
