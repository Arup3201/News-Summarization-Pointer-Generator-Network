They produced a retro match programme on Monday night to commemorate the 1962 FA Cup final between these two clubs at Wembley, back in the days when Burnley and Tottenham Hotspur were competing for the highest honours in English football.

How sad then that the Jimmy McIlroy Stand at Turf Moor, named after one of the heroes of that Burnley side, was shut down in advance and left empty due to a glaring lack of local interest for the first FA Cup tie here in four years.

It was a depressing indication of how far the old competition has fallen in the eyes of some supporters, particularly when two Premier League rivals meet in the early rounds; even more so on this occasion when the game was shunted back to a peculiar Monday night slot on the day most people were returning to work after a fixture intensive Christmas break.

Nearly 2,500 Spurs fans made the trip to Turf Moor and made their voices heard at the sparsely filled ground

That didn’t stop 2,500 Tottenham fans doing their bit after making the journey north, but it contributed to a flat atmosphere – especially in the first half - at a half-empty Turf Moor.

‘It’s a tough one for fans,’ admitted Burnley manager Sean Dyche. ‘Monday night is an awkward one. Both teams made the decision on that because of the physicality. 

'There’s been a real amount of miles put on the clock by our players, so that worked for us as a small group.

‘It’s slightly different for Tottenham. They made seven changes and had £130million-worth of talent on the pitch so I don’t think there was a lack of quality with the players coming in.

‘But maybe that affected the ticketing and people coming to the stadium. 

'And, of course, all these Premier League games. They’re not cheap for everyone up here so I understand that.’

Dyche revealed that his squad has been further depleted by the loss of defender Kevin Long, who will miss the rest of the season after rupturing a cruciate ligament in the draw at Newcastle on New Year’s Day. 

Burnley will now step up their efforts to extend Michael Keane’s loan from Manchester United or sign him on a permanent basis.

A replay was the last thing Tottenham needed as they face a fixture pile-up in the second half of the season due to their commitments in the Capital One Cup and Europa League.

Mauricio Pochettino’s side will have to play at least 11 games between now and the end of February, and at best will have only one free midweek between now and mid-March.

‘I’m a little bit disappointed because we need to play another 90 minutes’ said the Spurs boss. ‘ But we are still in the FA Cup and it is important for Tottenham to be in the next round.’
