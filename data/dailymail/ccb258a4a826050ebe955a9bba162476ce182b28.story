A drinker who killed a Strictly Come Dancing lighting technician outside a kebab house in a ‘senseless and brutal attack’ after he mocked the size of his nose was yesterday jailed for six years.

Ben Worden, 33, of Welling, south-east London, punched Paul Gunner, 32, twice last October and sent him crashing to the ground in an act of ‘random street violence’ in Bexley, south-east London.

Mr Gunner, who had been out celebrating his 32nd birthday, died from massive brain injuries within an hour of being struck outside the kebab shop after his skull fractured ‘like a plate breaking’.

Worden and his victim, who was employed by BBC contractor Set and Strike to install and dismantle TV sets, had been drinking in nearby Bar Lorca before their paths crossed in the takeaway last year.

Violence flared at the Charcoal Grill store after Mr Gunner asked his killer: ‘What are you looking at, you big-nosed c***?’

Worden then struck his victim twice before running off and bragging to a group of women about his vicious attack. He told them: ‘I’ve just smashed someone up - look at my knuckles.’

‘Despite having laid out Mr Gunner including, we suggest, seeing and hearing his head hit the pavement, he made no attempt to stay and help the injured man,’ Timothy Cray, prosecuting, said.

‘Instead, he fled from the scene with two friends he had been drinking with that evening. Far from showing concern of remorse, his attitude was to boast about what he had done.

‘He was pleased with himself.’ Mr Cray added: ‘He had no need to attack Mr Gunner in the first place and, more seriously, at the time of the second punch, he could easily have walked away.

'What are you looking at, you big-nosed c***?'

What Paul Gunner asked Ben Worden

‘In all his actions amounted to thuggish behaviour, random street violence that had the most tragic consequences.’

Witness Clive Williams said Mr Gunner had crashed to the ground after he was struck. ‘He hit his head onto the road, and all I could hear was a sound that was like a plate breaking,’ he said.

Worden admitted throwing the first punch but claimed it was his friend, James Parsons, who had delivered the fatal blow. ‘I hit him,’ he said. ‘With my hand on his face, in a clenched fist.

‘I hit him on the left side of his face. At the time I didn’t think it was that hard, but he fell straight over.’

He said James Parsons had punched Mr Gunner as he was getting up from the floor before a friend of the victim came over to intervene.

'It is shocking that such an innocuous dispute could be met with this level of violence and have such tragic consequences for Mr Gunner’s friends and family'  

Detective Inspector Rick Murphy

Worden was cleared of murder, but convicted of manslaughter by a majority of 10-2 after a trial at Inner London Crown Court.

The jury rejected Gunner’s claim of Mr Parsons being involved in causing the victim’s death.

Speaking after he was sentenced to six years, Detective Inspector Rick Murphy said Mr Gunner ‘was enjoying a birthday celebration when he fell victim to this senseless and brutal attack’.

He added: ‘It is shocking that such an innocuous dispute could be met with this level of violence and have such tragic consequences for Mr Gunner’s friends and family.  It is right that Worden should face the consequences of his actions.’
