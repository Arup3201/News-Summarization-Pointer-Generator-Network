South African President Jacob Zuma has been ordered to repay some of the £12.9million of taxpayer's money spent on so-called 'security measures' at his private home after it emerged they  included a swimming pool, amphitheatre and tuckshop.

An official report entitled 'Opulence on a Grand Scale' found Zuma had derived 'substantial' personal gain from improvements to his private compound at Nkandla in the rolling hills of KwaZulu-Natal province.

They reportedly include a visitors' centre, cattle enclosure, marquee area, football pitch, helipad, medical clinic, extensive paving and new houses for the polygamist president's large family.

Jacob Zuma has been ordered to pay back some of the £12.9 million of public money spent on his private home after it emerged so-called 'security measures' included a swimming pool, football 
pitch and tuckshop 

The leaked findings of Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's investigation will reinforce a perception of runaway corruption under Zuma and could hurt him and the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in an election due in six months.

Zuma's spokesman declined to comment, while Madonsela's office said the leak was 'unethical and unlawful'.

The ANC threw its weight behind Zuma, saying it believed he had done nothing wrong.

Gain: South African President Jacob Zuma

The government went to court this month to try to prevent Madonsela from releasing the outcome of her investigation, arguing that cabinet ministers needed more time to work out whether its findings could jeopardise Zuma's security.

It dropped its challenge after Madonsela, a quietly spoken lawyer seemingly unfazed by the pressure of her role, said she had gone to great lengths to ensure the report posed no threat.

The Mail and Guardian newspapers said Madonsela's report accused Zuma, a polygamous Zulu traditionalist whose five years in office have been littered with scandals over violating ethics codes by failing to protect state resources and misleading parliament.

Zuma told parliament last year all the buildings in the sprawling compound had been built 'by ourselves as family and not by the government'.

Opposition parties seized on this particular aspect of the report to attack Zuma, who became president in 2009 only after corruption charges against him were withdrawn on a technicality.

Prominent social campaigner Zackie Achmat launched an online petition for him to be impeached and the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) called for no-confidence vote in parliament, even though Zuma is shielded by the ANC's nearly two-thirds majority.

The report also found some of the more legitimate security features, such as 20 houses for police protection, a clinic and two helipads, were excessive and should have been placed in a nearby town to benefit the broader community, the paper said.

The paper estimated some of the questionable features of the upgrade at 20 million rand ($2 million). It also said Zuma had had his private architect drafted in as 'principal agent' to oversee the upgrade, even though he was not a security expert.

Anger: The government¿s decision to spend over £12.4 million ($20 million) of taxpayer money to revamp Zuma¿s private property has sparked public anger

Defiant: South African media have defied a government warning and splashed pictures of President Jacob Zuma's private home which was controversially revamped using taxpayers' money

The 215 million rand spent on Zuma's 
home is in stark contrast to state money spent on improving the security
of previous South African presidents, the Mail and Guardian said.

FW
de Klerk, South Africa's last white president, who left office in 1994,
received 236,000 rand for upgrades to his house, while 32 million rand 
was spent on Nelson Mandela's home.

The
Nkandla saga has been rich fodder for South Africa's newspapers, 
especially since the government invoked apartheid-era security laws to 
declare the compound a 'national key point' and prevent photographs of 
it from being published.

When
State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele reminded the media of the laws 
at a news conference this month, newspapers responded by splashing 
photos of the complex across their front pages beneath headlines such as
'So, arrest us' and 'Look away!'

There are now at least 20 buildings on
estate, including a number of large family homes, a medical clinic, 
swimming pool, football pitch, secure underground living quarters, tuck 
shop, helipad and visitors centre.

How the other half live: The spending sparked public anger amid an economic crunch in a country where 10 million people live on social grants and many have only tin shacks for their homes

Ariel
photographs of the lush site show an entire hamlet of large, modern 
buildings behind a huge security fence in rolling countryside.

The spending revelations have prompted widespread public anger within South Africa and claims of corruption.

Many
South Africans are incensed at the prospect that their 70-year-old 
president - who already has three official state residences - might be 
using taxpayer's money for private gain.

There
are also long running concerns about the financial burden placed on the
public purse by the polygamous president's four wives and estimated 20 
children.

Speaking on 
Thursday morning Minister Cwele cited a law first introduced during the 
apartheid period to argue that Zuma's private home is a 'National Key 
Point' which should not be photographed for security reasons.
