The US Navy's brand-new aircraft carrier, scheduled for delivery in 2016 at a cost of over $12 billion, may be less effective than the ships it is designed to replace, it was revealed today.

USS Gerald R. Ford is the lead ship in a new class of advanced carriers with an incredible amount of firepower and stuffed with cutting-edge and top secret technology.

But an internal review document obtained by the Boston Globe points out a number of performance issues with critical systems on the ship, even including the launch and landing of aircraft. 

Fanfare: The new $12billion carrier was christened in November 2013, but a new report has shown a number of concerning developmental problems

When finished, it is hoped the giant 1,106-foot carrier will be able to launch 220 airstrikes per day from its two runways, hold 4,000 sailors and marines, and be virtually invisible to enemy radar.

Yet this report shows the ship, which is currently being tested in a yard in Virginia, has problems in four vital areas.

As well as the fundamental issues in launching and landing military jets, there are also concerns about the ship's complex radar system and a weapons elevator.

The Boston Globe reports that the document shows that other systems, such as communications, are operating below expected standards.

'Poor reliability of these critical systems could cause a cascading series of delays during flight operations that would affect [the ship's] ability to generate sorties, make the ship more vulnerable to attack, or create limitations during routine operations,' the report states.

The author of the assessment, J. Michael Gilmore, has reportedly concluded that the Navy may have to rethink these important components of the ship.

This review was written over a year-long evaluation of the carrier which was completed in September 2013.

Experts have stated that development problems are common on the lead ship of a new class carrier and around 40 percent of the Gerald Ford class consists of completely new components. 

And Rear Admiral Thomas J. Moore told the Globe that he is that these problems can be ironed out in the two years before the ship is due for delivery.

'With these new technologies comes a lot of developmental challenges,' Moore said. 'We expect to wring out the rest of the problems,' he told the paper. 'We have 26 months to go.'

But one of the biggest problems is the issue with the launching and landing of jets, specifically designed to increase the number of flights that can be flown from one carrier.

The new launching system for planes is powered electromagnetically rather than the steam action of the past and it is designed to launch many planes very quickly.

Yet, according to the report, tests have shown that it is reliable at only 240 launches without a failure. At this point in time it should be able to achieve 1,250 
launches without failure.

The landing system, which effectively 'catches' aircraft on the deck with a series of cables is only averaging 20 successful landings without 
failure. It should be reaching 4,950 successful landings.

Time: The Navy is confident that the issues will be resolved for delivery of the carrier. 'We expect to wring out the rest of the problems,' Rear Admiral Thomas J. Moore said. 'We have 26 months to go'
