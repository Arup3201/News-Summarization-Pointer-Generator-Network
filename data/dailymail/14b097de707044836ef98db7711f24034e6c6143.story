A widow whose husband perished in an Arizona wildfire in June has appealed to Gov. Jan Brewer for help after she was told she and her unborn child do not qualify for full survivors benefits.

Roxanne Warneke lost her Marine veteran husband Billy, 25, to the fire that overcame Yarnell Hill and killed 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters, who worked for the city of Prescott.

But Mrs Warneke, whose daughter is due in December, has been told that she does not qualify for full health benefits because her husband, who had only worked with the Hotshots for three months before he died, was only a seasonal employee.

All 19 Hotshot families will receive worker's compensation and a federal payment of $328,000, but 13 families do not qualify for the full health benefits or lifetime salaries, which are worth thousands.

Fight: Roxanne Warneke, whose husband Billy died in the Yarnell Hill fire on June 30, has pleaded to Gov. Jan Brewer for her help in securing full health benefits for all of the families left bereaved

Mrs Warneke has argued that her husband lost his life protecting the town and its residents, and that the city should pay out fully to any responder who dies on state land.

'They all deserve equal treatment because
they all made the same ultimate sacrifice,' Mrs Warneke said at a press
conference on Wednesday.

In a letter to the governor, she said she is worried about health care coverage for her and her child.

'Billy was thrilled to work alongside the best of the best – and he was determined to do whatever he could do to be among the best of that supremely talented crew,' she wrote.

Missed: Billy Warneke had been fighting fires with the Hotshots for just three months before he died

Torn apart: The couple had been married for four years and their first daughter is due in December

She said that by failing to receive 
the same pension benefits or health insurance as the permanent 
employees, 'the difference is substantial, hundreds of thousands of 
dollars over the course of a lifetime'.

The city has argued that it is legally
prohibited from reclassifying seasonal employees as full-time 
employees after their deaths. They said they cannot give 
full benefits even if they want to.

Arizona
House Speaker Andy Tobin, whose district includes Prescott, said he is 
working on legislation to resolve the issues, the Arizona Republic 
reported.

He said that men 
or women who put themselves in danger to protect the larger community 
should be assured that their families will be cared for if they die, 
Tobin said.

The governor has received Warneke’s letter, and wants to see the issue resolved a spokeswoman said on Friday, NBC News reported.

Killer: The fire destroyed hundreds of homes and was eventually put out 10 days after the deaths

She 'shares in the frustration felt by her and the other families of the firefighters tragically killed in the Yarnell Hill Fire,' spokeswoman Ann Dockendorff said in an email.

'There are numerous legal, policy, and
fiscal questions that must be considered... Because this issue is so 
important, it's critical that policymakers get it right.'

The
fight comes after another widow, Juliann Ashcraft, said she is 
considering suing the City of Prescott for the benefits and salary that 
her husband Andrew was receiving before he died.

Mrs Ashcraft said she was relying on 
the income to raise the couple's four young children - and she has 
argued that her husband was misclassified as 'seasonal' staff.

'Everyone
says every day will get better and in fact every day gets harder,' 
Juliann Ashcraft said at a press conference last week.

Battle: Juliann Ashcraft, who also lost her husband in the fire, has previously spoken out about how she is not getting proper benefits, although her husband worked full-time for the fire department

Loss: Juliann said losing Andrew, left, means she is struggling to care for their four young children

'I have four small children that now I've got to find a way to provide for them because my husband giving the ultimate sacrifice, in the city's eyes, wasn't enough to seal the deal that we'll be given health benefits, that we'll be given his salary moving forward,' she said.

She has argued that he worked full-time on a full-time salary. 

'I said to them, "My husband was a 
full-time employee, he went to work full-time for you,"' she said, 'and 
their response to me was, "Perhaps there was a communication issue in 
your marriage."'

Mrs 
Ashcraft, still mourning the loss of her 29-year-old hero, is desperate 
for help, as the costs associated with bringing up four children mount.

Decisions: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has said that she wants the issue to be resolved for the families

Quite literally, my bills are being paid by the good people of the world who are giving donations, because the city of Prescott isn't doing anything for us,' she told the TV station. 'Now I have four kids and myself, and I don't know what I'm going to do.

'I want to be able to just be mourning my husband, be supporting my children, be figuring out what our new normal is.'

The 19 men perished on June 30 as they battled to control the flames ravaging Yarnell Hill. But the highly-skilled team were overcome when a sudden wind change forced the fire in their direction.

They deployed their emergency shelters as a last-ditch attempt to save their lives, but all perished. Only one member of the team, who was serving as a look out, survived the tragedy.
