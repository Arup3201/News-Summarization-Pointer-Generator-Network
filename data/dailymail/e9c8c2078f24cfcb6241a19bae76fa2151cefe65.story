New details: Secret documents have revealed that Jimmy Savile gave money to children and claimed it back on BBC expenses

Jimmy Savile made several secret payments to children at the height of his offending and managed to claim the cash back from the BBC as expenses, it was revealed today.

Confidential documents show the paedophile handed £10 to three youngsters in 1974 - worth around £72 today - after they had appeared on his Clunk Click TV show.

Savile, who was being paid the huge sum of £2,350 for every show he presented, demanded the money back and the Corporation obliged and never asked why he paid the children.

A letter, dated April 18 1974, shows the transactions and has today been released by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act.

'We understand from London that during the above programme [Clunk Click] you dispersed £10 each to the following young people [names blanked out],' it says.

'We therefore enclose our cheque for £30 to reimburse you.'

The payments were during the peak period of his predatory attacks, between 1966 and 1976, when he was aged between 40 and 50.

In 1974 alone there were 30 occasions where he allegedly sexually abused both children and adults.

Since October there have been 450 complaints to police about him - 214 have been recorded as crimes. His earliest offence was in Manchester in 1955, and the final reported allegation was in 2009 when he was aged 82.

Some were allegedly attacked on BBC premises, including in his dressing room and the caravan he kept in the Television Centre car park in London.

But despite abusing all over Britain he was never brought to justice even though police had chances to prosecute him while the DJ was alive.

Yesterday it was revealed an officer from West Yorkshire Police is to be investigated after being accused of contacting Surrey Police on the DJ's behalf before they interviewed Savile over three alleged sex crimes in 2009.

The reasons for these new secret payments to Clunk Click children are a mystery, but the BBC maintains there is no evidence that the youngsters were victims.

A BBC spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'The document shows Savile was reimbursed the sum of £30 but there are no further details about this transaction which took place over 40 years ago'.

But the solicitor representing victims said the cash could be something more worrying.

'The payments could be deeply sinister, or it could just be that Savile was tight,' Alan Collins from the Pannone law firm told the Daily Express.

'We know he met kids in cafes and perhaps bought them drinks, but I can’t think why he would want to reimburse himself.

'It is well known he was reportedly tight-fisted, but given what we have learned over the past few months, one has got to keep an open mind about this.'

The FOI shows other expenses claims he made when he was at the Corporation.

It appears he demanded a new suit for every show he presented and asked for, and was given, an £1,800 pay rise per show in 1990 to allow for inflation - a huge sum at the time.

He also asked for £200 travelling expenses for every programme because he lived in northern England, not London.

A memo in 1989 said: 'Perhaps predictably Jimmy has raised the question of expenses using the argument that although he maintains a flat in London, he is now principally resident in Leeds.'
