After rooting out thousands of white-owned farms, Zimbabwe is now targeting ‘foreign’ trees for the axe.

Indigenous trees can stay, but firs, pines and eucalyptus that were planted by early white settlers to remind them of their distant homes are now being pulled up. 

But the policy has nothing to do with the politics of President Robert Mugabe, or his black empowerment law meant to reverse the entitlements of the white-led rule of the past.

Royal Harare club manager Ian Mathieson said a program to cut down 'alien' trees and replant trees 'indigenous' to Zimbabwe such as the acacia and msasa varieties is under way, and will take 20 years to complete. 

So far, nearly 60 gnarled and elderly 'foreign' trees have been removed and more than 300 local trees and shrubs have been planted in their place. 

Foreign eucalyptus, or gum trees, most of them over 100 years old, are set for the chainsaw, said Mathieson.

'If we are to retain water, these trees need to come down' Mathieson said. Nearby pine trees also make the soil acidic and 'there is also the threat of falling debris from the old trees' he said. 

The early settlers, mainly British, were homesick regions and golf gave them solace.

They planted imported trees and shrubs in Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known before independence in 1980. 

King George V, the queen’s grandfather,  played on the course in 1929, bestowing the royal title on the club. But the last of the hardy, long-living foreign trees he saw are being cut down now.

The first settlers felled the indigenous trees on the course and wild animals that once roamed there disappeared too. 

Experts have been called in for the replanting exercise that requires careful planning.

Every hole has trees planted in ways to make the game more challenging, according to Mathieson. 'A player has to contend with the trees if he hits the ball out of the fairway' he said. 

The purple blossoming jacaranda tree, a native of South America and Asia brought to Africa by early missionaries, will be spared at Royal Harare.

It has become synonymous with Zimbabwe’s 'spring' season because it blooms at winter’s end. 

Thorn trees, a member of the local acacia species that grows in dozens of African varieties with different hues and shapes, are the indigenous trees of choice at the golf club. 

The course is home to more than 100 species of birds, many of which migrate thousands of kilometers to the southern hemisphere every year, he said.
