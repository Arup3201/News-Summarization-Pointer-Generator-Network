A village shop is claiming to be Britain's cheapest supermarket because customers can get up to two thirds off the price of groceries.

The discount store is the first 'social supermarket' run by Community Shop and it is designed to help families who are stuck in food property.

Up to 500 people can become a member of the shop, set up in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire, as long as they claim one of a specified list of benefits including Employment Support Allowance.

Supermarket: Low income families can apply to become a member of the Community Shop in Goldthorpe

Stock: Shoppers can choose food and household goods at a reduced price as they would be thrown out by bigger supermarkets due to damage or labeling errors. Instead they will be sold to hard-up families

Wide range: Community Shop manager Sarah Dunwell is director of social affairs at Company Shop. The store will offer a wide range of food to people provided they are receiving one of a list of benefits

Stock will arrive daily from manufacturers and suppliers with the permission of shops such as Tesco, Asda, Marks and Spencer, Morrisons and Ocado.

Social entrepreneur Sarah Dunwell is director of social affairs at Company Shop which is the parent company of Community Shop.

Company Shop is the largest re distributor of surplus food in the UK.

She said 500 people will be given membership for six months to test whether the social supermarket idea works with the hope of launching 20 nationwide next year, including six in London.

She said: 'We are aiming to fill a gap between foodbanks and mainstream retail. Lots of families are not in such an emergency situation but are on the cusp of food poverty.

'It is for anyone who is claiming any of a list of benefits. It's not just  about the long-term unemployed but really hard-working families who are  struggling.

Fresh: Community Shop manager Sarah Dunwell said 500 people will be given membership for six months to test whether the social supermarket idea works. If successful, she wants to open 20 including six in London

Toiletries: As well as food, other household products will be on offer when the supermarket opens on December 9. Stock will arrive daily from manufacturers and suppliers with permission from supermarkets

Cheap: Some top brands that would sell for much more in big-name supermarkets will be on offer at the community store for a fraction of the price to help people in food poverty eat well for less

'It's more than about just cheap food. We offer a full package of support with  a cafe, a cookery school, support for people who need advice on payday lending, alcohol support and domestic violence among other things.'

She explained that the supermarket, which won't sell alcohol or tobacco, will use residual food not needed by the larger supermarkets for a variety of  reasons including damaged packaging or the wrong labelling.

'We'll have staples such as sugar, pasta and rice but also more expensive goods such as French cheeses, ready-made lasagne and desserts and household products,' she explained. 'This is not cheap food for the poor, it will bring a huge range of foods.

Helping hand: Cut price brand names will be on sale at the new store which organisers hope will be the first of many across the UK aimed at helping families living in food poverty and struggling to buy food for themselves

Community: Sarah Dunwell wants the supermarket to 'fill a gap between foodbanks and mainstream retail'

Wrong packaging: The store takes goods, including food and toiletries, from supermarkets that are damaged or have been incorrectly labelled and sells them for a low price to struggling families who become members

'It takes stuff that will not make it to supermarket shelves and uses it to  feed people who need it most.

'While we have people in the UK going hungry it is wrong such foods should be thrown away.'Members will be assessed at the end of six months with the aim being that they no longer need the social supermarket.

Leaflets publicising the scheme have already been delivered to homes in Goldthorpe, which is being targeted as an area of serious poverty.

The shop will open on December 9.

Incorrect: Yoghurts with incorrect packaging will be sold at the first community supermarket in the UK which opens in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire. The store is a pilot scheme to see if the idea will work

Membership: A customer swipes their membership card to enter the community supermarket. As well as sugar, pasta and rice there will also be more expensive goods such as French cheeses and desserts

Group: Members will be assessed at the end of six months when it is hoped they will not need the service
