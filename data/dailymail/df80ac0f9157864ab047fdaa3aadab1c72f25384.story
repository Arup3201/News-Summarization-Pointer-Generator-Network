A 17-year-old boy has been hailed a hero for pulling a 73-year-old man to safety after they were both hit by a truck - even though the teen had himself suffered three fractured vertebrae.

Dalton Surbey, a high school junior from Montpelier, Ohio, came to Duane Ward's aid during a car accident on Ohio 576 during white-out conditions on Saturday, according to the Bryan Times.

Surbey had stopped at the scene of a crash and climbed out of his car to check on the driver when his car was rear-ended by another vehicle, according to the Ohio State Patrol.

Ward also got out of his car to check on the scene when a black Ford Range truck hit both of them.

They were thrown in the air and Ward, also from Montpelier, suffered a broken pelvis and tailbone.

'I was knocked to the ground and could not get out of the way,' Ward told the Bryan Times. 'I couldn't move. I thought I was going to get run over.'

Surbey fractured three vertebrae but he knew he had to act.

'I felt some pain when I stood up,' he said. 'Then I heard him scream and I started looking for him... He was in the opposite lane and I thought, 'I can't let him stay there'.'

He ran over to Ward and took him to a ditch by the side of the road before checking no one else was hurt, he said.

If Ward had remained in the road, he would have been in 'imminent danger' so the teenager may well have saved his life, Ohio State Patrol Sergeant Michael McClain told CBS News. 

Heroic: Ward, a high school junior, said he had not wanted the stranger to suffer even worse injuries

Dangerous: A photograph of a different crash scene (taken in Columbus, Ohio) shows the treacherous driving conditions motorists were facing amid the snow on Saturday

Ward agreed.

'If he would not have been there, I probably wouldn't be here,' he said. 'Certainly, he is a hero.' 

Surbey, a high school basketball player, was also treated in hospital but has since been released. He shared photos from inside hospital to his Twitter page. 

'Well there goes the rest of the season,' he wrote.

He told the Bryan Times he did not want to be considered a hero. 

'I just thought he was in trouble and the last thing I wanted was for him to get hurt worse,' he said.
