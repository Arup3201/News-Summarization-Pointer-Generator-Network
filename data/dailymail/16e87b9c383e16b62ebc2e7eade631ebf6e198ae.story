A three-year-old boy with cancer is in a race against time to start vital treatment in the U.S. before Christmas.

Braiden-Lee Prescott and his family, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, need to raise £250,000 within two months to give the youngster the best chance of survival.

He was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in February and has had radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.

Now he needs to go abroad to access a crucial treatment that could stimulate his immune system and prevent a relapse, because it is not available in the UK.

To add to the family's problems, Braiden needs to have the pricey therapy by the beginning of December - within 100 days of a bone marrow operation he had in August.

Well-wishers have rallied to raise £57,000 so far, but the deadline is looming.

The boy's father Wayne, 34, full-time mother Stef, 21, and little brother Tyler hope to spend six months in Philadelphia while he completes the treatment.

Mr Prescott, a former mechanic who now cares full time for his son, said: 'I find it hard to put into words how devastated we were by the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, but we’ve done our best to pick ourselves up and be strong for our little man. Braiden-Lee is having frontline neuroblastoma treatment now and is doing so well - he’s still smiling!

Our inspiration: His parents Wayne and Stef are desperate to get the boy treatment that will prevent a relapse - if he has it within 100 days of his bone marrow transplant

'Happy and cheeky': Braiden's family noticed something was wrong when he suddenly developed a limp and a temperature in February

'He’s our inspiration, a very special little boy and he is a true fighter. We would do anything to get our boy the treatment he deserves and ask everyone to do what they can to help us get to America.'

The family hope Braiden will get Children’s Oncology Group neuroblastoma treatment, which will improve his chances of beating the disease by 25 per cent.

This treatment will help stimulate Braiden’s body to recognise and attack the neuroblastoma if it was to return, which is always a worry with this deadly disease, where relapse rates are high.

Braiden was diagnosed after he started limping. Doctors thought at first it was septic arthritis, and transferred him to Manchester Children’s Hospital, but even after an operation, his problem persisted.

Eventually, after a bone marrow biopsy, they realised he had childhood cancer stage 4 neuroblastoma.

Hope for the future: The U.S. treatment could improve Braiden's chance of survival by 25 per cent

Determination: There is always a worry of relapse with this deadly disease, so Braiden's family want to see his immune system restored

Grandfather Paul Reece said Braiden is a normal, happy and cheeky boy, but suddenly developed a limp one day in February 2012.

'We kept our eye on Braiden and over the next three days he was still limping,'  he said. 'He also developed a temperature.

'We took him to the doctors, then to Leigh walk-in centre and he was sent to Wigan Infirmary where they ran tests and transferred him to Manchester Children’s Hospital.

'They thought it was septic arthritis and he underwent an operation, then later scans and a biopsy revealed he had cancer. This devastated us, our two-year-old happy little boy with the rare childhood cancer neuroblastoma.

'He is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment. He is our inspiration, a very special little boy and a true fighter.'
