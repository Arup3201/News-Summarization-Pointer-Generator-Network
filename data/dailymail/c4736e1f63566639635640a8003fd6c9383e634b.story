Doctors were shocked when they X-rayed a woman’s knees and found they were full of gold needles.

The 65-year-old South Korean woman had hundreds of tiny acupuncture needles in her knee tissue.

It is thought they were left around her joint intentionally by an alternative medical practitioner who was treating her for knee pain.

A 65-year-old South Korean woman was found to have hundreds of gold needles in her knees (pictured) after acupuncture treatment for her osteoarthritis. It's thought they were left there intentionally

The woman had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, LiveScience reports.

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and is characterised by inflammation of the affected joint, damage to the cartilage of the joint and bony growths around the edge of the joints.

Pain can result from the damage to the cartilage which lines the bones and allows the joints to move without friction.

The woman was treated with painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs but they failed to relieve the pain and they caused her stomach discomfort.

As a result, she turned to acupuncture for relief and is believed to have sought treatment at least once a week.

The therapy involves using needles to stimulate different parts of the body or to relieve pain.

Doctors say leaving the needles in the woman's knees was not necessarily a good idea as they could cause inflammation, infections and abscesses. They also make interpreting X-rays hard (file picture)

In the South Korean woman’s case, it is thought the needles were left inside her knees to provide continued stimulation after the treatment had ended.

However, many experts believe leaving foreign objects inside a person’s body is not a good idea.

Dr Ali Guermazi, a professor of radiology at Boston University, who was not involved in the woman’s treatment, said they could cause swelling, abscesses and infections.

He told LiveScience that leaving the needles in her knee could make it difficult for doctors to interpret X-rays.

Additionally, he said it would mean she could not have an MRI scan if needed because the magnets in the scanner could cause the needles to move and damage an artery.

The woman’s case was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.

They could have been left there to 'provide continuing stimulation'

Doctors say this is not advisable as the needles could cause swelling, infections or abscesses - they also make interpreting X-rays difficult
