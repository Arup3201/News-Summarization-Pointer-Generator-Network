Guilty: Darren Hislop, 42, a police worker, groped two women colleagues at his office Christmas party said it was all part of the festive fun

A police worker groped two women colleagues at his office Christmas party but claimed it was all part of the festive fun, a court heard today.

Darren Hislop, 42, of Newport, South Wales, cupped the breasts of one shocked office worker and grabbed the bottom of the other.

Hislop had also trapped another woman colleague in an office saying: 'What are we going to do then ... just the two of us?'

Civilian support worker Hislop claimed his groping was just an innocent part of office life.

But Cardiff Crown Court heard all three women were left 'unsure' in the company of men.

Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: “Hislop and other civilian workers were out at a Christmas celebration party when he touched the women.

“One of his female colleagues was waiting to be served at the bar when he went behind her and grabbed her bottom.

'Later he approached another female colleague, put his arms around her from behind and cupped both her breasts in his hands.

'When he was interviewed by police officers, he accepted it had happened but claimed it was all in keeping with the spirit of a Christmas party.'

The court heard the office incident happened five months earlier at a police station in Cwmbran, near Newport, South Wales.

Mr Griffiths said: 'She wanted some boxes moved from her room and asked him to help.

Hislop, of Newport, was given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 160 hours unpaid work at Cardiff Crown Court

'But as they were walking in, he said: “What are we going to do then ... just the two of us?”

'She said he looked quite serious and aggressive, she didn’t know what he was going to do but thought he was going to try it on by kissing or groping her or even more.'

The court heard a male colleague walked in and saw Hislop pressing the 'frightened-looking' woman against a filing cabinet.

Mr Griffiths added: 'The victims say they have become wary and unsure with male colleagues since.'

Hislop denied three charges of sexual assault but admitted three charges of common assault.

He was sacked yesterday from his £28,000-a-year job with Gwent Police.

Judge Phillip Richards told Hislop: 'Your behaviour was unacceptable and you are likely to suffer serious consequences as a result.

'You now have a criminal record and it will affect your future.

'I have no doubt at all the three ladies were stressed and upset.'

Hislop, of Newport, was given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 160 hours unpaid work.

Judge Richards added: 'If you breach the order the court can deal with you in a way which is very much more unpleasant.'
