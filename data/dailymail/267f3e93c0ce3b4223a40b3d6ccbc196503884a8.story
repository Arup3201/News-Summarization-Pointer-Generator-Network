A man has lost an eye after he was shot with a catapult at the site where King Harold lost the Battle of Hastings, a court heard.

Isaac Fuller, 25, was visiting the famous landmark when he was hit in the left eye with a projectile fired by Eli King and Anthony Adams, both 23.

Mr Fuller, lost sight in his eye following the incident, which took place in the same location King Harold died after being shot with an arrow in the eye in battle against William the Conqueror in 1066.

The attack took place in May in the town of Battle, East Sussex, the site of the famous Battle of Hastings.

Mr Fuller said the pair shot at him because King was jealous of the victim's relationship with his ex-girlfriend. He fired at him near the exact spot where it is believed King Harold lost his eye.

King, from Battle, denied grievous bodily harm with intent but was jailed for 12 years after being found guilty by a jury at Brighton Crown Court.

Adams, also from Battle, admitted the same offence and was jailed for eight years.

Mr Fuller lost two teeth and his left eye during the sustained attack.

He told the court: ‘I got shot in Battle. I got shot in the back of the head, shot in the mouth and lost two teeth.

Janice Brennan, prosecuting, said: ‘He was battered and bruised, had lost his teeth and had completely lost his left eye.

‘He was attacked by two men. One was Anthony Adams. Mr Adams has pleaded guilty. The other was Mr King.’

He told the court how, during the attack, he turned around to see Adams, wielding a catapult, who then shot him in the mouth.

Mr Fuller ran away, where he was pelted with more projectiles by the pair, before stopping in an alleyway.

He said: ‘I stumbled and turned to face them. I looked up. I was looking straight at them when I got shot again.

‘I was shot in my left eye. It just came out. I fell down. Eli King shot me in the eye.’

After the sentencing, Sussex Police said: ‘King and Adams fired ball bearings pellet from catapults at the victim and one of the ball bearing hit him in the eye blinding him. He ended up losing his eye.’

Detective Sergeant Paul Graham added: ‘The sentences Adams and King received reflect the seriousness of the assault.

‘The victim suffered a sustained attack which resulted in life changing injuries. The long jail sentences send out a message that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated.’

This scene, from the Bayeux tapestry, shows the moment King Harold was shot in the eye in 1066
