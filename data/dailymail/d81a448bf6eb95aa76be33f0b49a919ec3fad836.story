The mother of a boy, 8, found dead after being locked in a room with a lit hibachi-style grill was found not guilty by reason of insanity.

In a jury-waived trial, Norfolk County, Massachusetts Judge Robert C. Cosgrove found that Li Rong Zhang lacked criminal responsibility for son Brandon Yang’s 2011 death.

Authorities say the 42-year-old Quincy, Massachusetts woman intended to kill herself and her son.

Not guilty: Li Rong Zhang was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2011 hibachi grill death of her 8-year-old son

Suicidal: Brandon Yang was found dead near his unconscious mother, of carbon monoxide poisoning after his 16-year-old brother called firefighters in January 2011

Investigators into the boy’s death found that Zhang had placed a large bureau in front of a bedroom door where Brandon was found dead, face-down on a bed January 13, 2011.

It was Zhang’s other son, then 16-year-old Deming Yang, who first spotted trouble and called authorities.

He told police he arrived home from school that day to find all the doors to his house locked. When he got inside, he smelled smoke.

He was unable to get inside his mother’s room. Firefighters arrived and broke open the door, finding Zhang on the floor of the room, as well.

They also found a grill, lighter, and charcoal briquettes.

Yang was pronounced dead from carbon monoxide poisoning at 4:50pm at Quincy Medical Center.

The following afternoon, Zhang would be arraigned at another area hospital where she was being treated.

Multiple medical experts testified during the trial to Zhang’s mental state at the time of her son’s death.

The judge agreed that Zhang exhibited psychotic depression with paranoid delusions and was suicidal at time of the incident.

According
to the Patriot Ledger, the judge also heard testimony that Zhang had 
been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2010.

Too late: Authorities broke into Zhang's bedroom at the Quincy, Massachusetts home, which investigators say she barricaded with a dresser, and found a grill, charcoal, and lighter. Brandon was dead when they arrived

Zhang was taken to Worcester State Hospital following the verdict for treatment and evaluation.

However, that doesn’t mean she will spend the rest of her life in a mental hospital.

According to the Massachusetts Office for Victim Assistance, Massachusetts law says that offenders found not guilty by reason of mental illness can be released once they are deemed no longer a danger to themselves or others.
