A mother whose two daughters were trapped inside a submerged car in suburban Minneapolis on Thursday morning went into premature labor after hearing that one of her children had drowned, while the other remains fighting for life.

Shaniece Thompson, 25, said the horrifying news of the tragic incident led her to give birth on to a 3lb baby - also a daughter - on the same day that five-year-old Zenavia Rennie died in the accident.

Thompson, who was only 32 weeks pregnant at the time, has named the newborn child Dream and she is currently in neo-natal intensive care.

Shaniece Thompson, 25, said the horrifying news of the tragic incident lead her to give birth on to a 3lb baby - Dream - on the same day that her five-year-old daughter Zenavia Rennie died in the accident

Her other daughter, 6-year-old Zarihana Rennie, continues to battle for life and is listed in extremely critical condition following Thursay morning's incident.

Thompson’s daughters were amongst a group of five children trapped in the submerged car that was driven into an icy lake by unlicensed driver Marion Guerrido, 23.

She is the mother of the other three children in the car and is also the girlfriend of Julius Rennie, the father of Thompson’s children.

Her son Alarious Coleman-Guerrido, seven, died in the crash from complications of drowning.

Meanwhile her other children Amani Coleman-Guerrido and baby Aliyana Rennie (whose father is Julius 
Rennie) are in a critical condition, but continuing to make strides in their recovery. Their eyes are open and they are most responsive to verbal commands.

Thompson told CBS Minnesota that she has a lot of questions about the incident that she wants to ask Guerrido.

The officers and firefighters who jumped into the water have revealed that they had to use their feet to pull the kids out of the car

'I’m angry about the fact she was driving without a license. I’m angry at the fact she put all those kids in a small car,' Thompson said.

Rescuers
 worked frantically to try and free the children after their vehicle 
veered off a highway ramp and into the frigid pond shortly after 6am on 
Thursday.

The car was underwater for up to 45 minutes after the crash. St. Louis Park city spokesman Jamie Zwilling said the children were unconscious and unresponsive when pulled from the vehicle.

Zenavia Rennie of Brooklyn Center, was pronounced dead at around 7.30pm Thursday.

An attorney acting as the family spokesman told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that Alarious Coleman-Guerrido passed away before 10pm at Hennepin County Medical Center.

The driver, Marion Guerrido, 23, of Brooklyn Center, escaped from the four-door 1998 Pontiac Grand Am sedan and was unhurt.

One witness described seeing her in the pond, screaming for help.

‘The car was under water, and she must have been standing on top,' Jeff Robertson told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. ‘That pond is 8 or 9 feet deep, and the water was at her knees.’

Shaniece Thompson, center, has said she has a lot of questions for Marion Guerrido who was driving the vehicle which included her two daughters, one of whom is now dead and other remains in an extremely critical condition

The officers and firefighters who jumped into the water have revealed that they had to use their feet to pull the kids out of the car.

'I've been doing this a long time - 35 years and I've been involved in a lot of rescues. Never seen anything like that before,' paramedic Randy Elledge told MyFox9.

Firefighters in special suits that make them float first had to bring the driver, Guerrido, and a Good Samaritan to shore before Tim Smith with the St. Louis Park Fire Department started sweeping the inside of the car with his feet.

‘It was frustrating not being able to access the inside of the compartment and not being able to get in there and do what we could do with our hands,’ Smith said.

They pulled out three of the children through an open driver's side window and two more through back windows that Smith broke, then they carried the children to shore where paramedics were waiting to perform CPR.

Authorities say the five children were 
trapped underwater in the car for about 20 minutes in freezing water on Thursday morning

Four of the five children, including 
the two deceased, attended the Odyssey Academy, where little Zenavia had
 recently been named a star student.

The crash happened about 6:15 am at the 
junction of Highways 7 and 100 in St Louis Park, a western Minneapolis 
suburb.

It is not yet known how fast the car - a green Pontiac Grand Am -
 was going.

Lt Eric Roeske said the car veered 
left off a ramp and plunged down a slope into the pond about 40 to 50 
yards from the roadway. There is no guardrail between the road and the 
pond.

He told the Star Tribune the car landed in water that was 'quite deep', an estimated eight to nine feet, and was 'incredibly cold'.

'A passerby who jumped in the water was standing on the roof of the vehicle and the water was up to his neck,' Roeske said.

All victims were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center and the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children’s Hospital.

Asked to comment on whether the crash could have been intentional, Roeske said they were planning to fully investigate the incident, but there was no immediate information that would indicate the crash had happened on purpose.

Police say they are still looking into how the kids could ll fit in the four-door sedan and if any of them were wearing seat belts.

Crash: The children were not able to be rescued from the car until it was towed out of the water

The city fire department and the Hennepin County dive team worked to get the car out. she said it wasn't clear whether speed was a factor in the crash.

The road was wet from light mist, but not icy, he said.

Jeffrey Robertson, who lives in an apartment building close to the pond, said he heard a woman screaming as he was watching the morning news on TV.

He ran onto his second-floor balcony and saw a woman standing in water that was up to her knees, he told the Star Tribune. He then called 911 before running out to help the woman.
