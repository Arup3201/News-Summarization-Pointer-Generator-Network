Before she won the lottery, Jean Swatman would set her alarm for 5.30am, get up in the dark and be hard at work in a supermarket bakery by 6am.

Now, after scooping a life-changing £2million prize... she does exactly the same.

The 62-year-old grandmother, who still lives in the three-bedroom terraced house that has been her home for 20 years, said she has  no plans to retire from her £6-an-hour job.

Lottery winner: Doughnut maker Jean Swatman, 62, who won £2million but is still working in her local Morrisons

Celebration: Despite winning more than £2million, Jean Swatman has made just a few modest purchases so far

‘I really enjoy working at Morrisons and the people there are great,’  she said from her home in Lowestoft, Suffolk yesterday.

‘My daughter and son keep nagging on at me and saying there’s no need to get up so early to de-ice the car when you’re a millionaire.

‘But the win hasn’t changed me to be honest. Not to the extent where I’ve got flash cars and things.

‘I’m in the same house I was in before. I’m not one for extravagant things – I like a simple life.’

Mrs Swatman, who has worked at the supermarket for ten years, gets up at 5.30am four mornings a week so she can start her five-hour shifts at 6am.

After she won the £2,021,379 jackpot on June 1 by matching six numbers with a lucky dip ticket, her daughter Kerry-Anne Utting, 40, threw her work shoes in the bin to try and make her stay at home.

But Mrs Swatman, who did not check her winning ticket for more than 24 hours after the draw, was determined to stay grounded.

She used the money to pay for a holiday to Cambodia and a trip to Vietnam to see her son Wayne, 46, who works in the oil industry in Ho Chi Minh City.

Mrs Swatman, a widow, has also treated herself to a new car, but rather than splashing out on a Porsche or Ferrari, she has bought a more practical Vauxhall Antara 4x4 worth around £25,000.

She said she will invest some of her prize for her five grandchildren, adding: ‘I think with that amount of money you would have a hard job to spend it all anyway.’

Big win: Mrs Swatman gets up at 5.30am to go to work - despite winning enough money to retire immediately

Every day she fries hundreds of doughnuts before injecting them with jam and sprinking on sugar.

Mrs Swatman, who has two children and five grandchildren said the win had not caused her problems such as people asking her for favours. She said: 'Everybody has been absolutely fine.'

Mrs Swatman admitted at the time of her win that she enjoyed eating the doughnuts she makes, buying them with her ten per cent staff discount.

She said: 'You don't get sick of Morrisons doughnuts. They are lovely. I make hundreds of them every day and I still like them.'

Her win meant she had enough dough to buy more than 22million doughnuts from Morrisons, using her staff discount, as they were on offer at £1 for two packs of five at the time of her win.

Mrs Swatman whose husband Ben died six-years-ago added: 'At my age, I don't need to move to a big house or get anything flash.'

Graham Pallet, the manager of Morrisons at Lowestoft, said: 'We're delighted for Jean and her family. She's a valued member of the team and we hope she enjoys spending some of her well-deserved winnings.'
