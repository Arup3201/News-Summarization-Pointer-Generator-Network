A line of sensual lingerie is set to put an end to night-time disorientation.  

The luminous bra and knicker sets glow in a flourescent green, meaning your parter can always find you if you prefer to keep the lights off, and you'll never have to fumble with a bra strap in the dark again. 

LuminoGlow's latest line of pretty lingerie, called Aurora, is made from quality stretch crepe chiffon that is said to feel invisible to the wearer.

When the lights are switched off intricate patterns on the bra and knickers glow green in the dark, rather than the entire item, subtly highlighting your shape.

This is thanks to the fabric's clever high-tech, 'illuminating glow lace.'

Mother-of-two Jan Hawley, from Australia, founded the firm in 2008. 

She said: 'Wearers of LuminoGlow lingerie say it indulges their senses and the glow in the dark quality is sheer delight.

'They find ease of browsing and buying this most luxurious and sensual lingerie online especially appealing.' 

When the lights are on the underwear looks just like normal white lace lingerie, transforming only in the dark.

Each and every piece 'visibly exudes luxury, sensuality and panache', says the LimunoGlow webiste.

The firm state they invests in 'only the finest Italian lace and fabrics, which are carefully crafted into exquisite garments that are beautifully soft against the skin.

'Nothing is left to chance, with the glow-in-the-dark lace strategically positioned to complement the lingerie and accentuate the body.' 

Jan, a self-confessed visionary with an eye for design and a passion for lingerie, recruited Andrea Monti, an Italian with textiles expertise, to come on board with the creation of the pieces. 

Prices start at $65 (£41) for a thong, up to $180 (£115) for a chemise set. The new collection is available online at www.luminoglow.com.
