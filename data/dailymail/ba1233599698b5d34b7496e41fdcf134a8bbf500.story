The Liberal Democrat peer accused of sexual impropriety by a string of female party activists finally issued an apology to his alleged victims last night.

For four months Lord Rennard, the party’s former chief executive, has defied Nick Clegg by refusing point blank to say sorry to the women, who accused him of inappropriately touching and propositioning them.

Now, in letters to the four traumatised women, he has acknowledged for the first time that he ‘may well have encroached upon personal space’.

Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard has finally apologised to women who accused him of sexual harassment. He said he now realises he may have 'encroached upon "personal space"'

In grovelling terms, Lord Rennard wrote that he would like to ‘apologise sincerely for any such intrusion’, which he says ‘would have been inadvertent’. He expressed ‘regret for any harm or embarrassment caused’.

Last night two of the women refused to accept the peer’s apology, with one demanding that the Lib Dem leader throw Lord Rennard out of the party. But a friend of the peer said he now wanted to resume a full role in the party.

The return of the ‘pervy peer’ story to the headlines tops an appalling week for Mr Clegg.

His party endured a meltdown in the 
European elections, coming fifth and losing all but one of its seats – 
leading to calls for his resignation. On Wednesday, Lord Oakeshott, a 
friend of Business Secretary Vince Cable, resigned from the party after 
being caught out commissioning and leaking constituency polls designed 
to undermine Mr Clegg.

Now Mr Clegg faces a dilemma over whether he should re-admit Lord Rennard to the party following his apology.

Grovelling: Lord Rennard has made an apology to bring 'closure' after repeatedy saying he would not do so

It
 was in February last year that women who worked for the Lib Dems told 
Channel 4 News that the party’s most powerful official abused his 
position for years by inappropriately touching and propositioning them.

They claimed that leading Lib Dem MPs and peers who knew failed to take decisive action. Lord Rennard denied the allegations.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Lord Rennard would not be allowed back into the party until he apologised

The
 party conducted an internal inquiry, chaired by Alistair Webster QC. 
This January, the inquiry concluded that there was broadly credible 
evidence of ‘behaviour which violated the personal space and autonomy of
 the complainants’.

But it 
said it was ‘unlikely that it could be established beyond reasonable 
doubt that Lord Rennard had intended to act in an indecent or sexually 
inappropriate way’.

The report suggested Lord Rennard should apologise to the women, and when he refused to do so, he was suspended.

At
 the time, the Lib Dem peer issued a personal statement denying the 
allegations of sexual impropriety, saying: ‘I do not believe that people
 should be forced to say what they know they should not say, or do not 
mean.’ But, now he has had a change of heart. The letter to the four 
women reads: ‘Lord Rennard wishes to achieve closure of the contentious 
issues that have been in the public domain for the last 14 months by 
expressing his apologies to Susan Gaszczak, Alison Goldsworthy, Bridget 
Harris and Alison Smith.

‘Lord Rennard wishes to make it absolutely clear that it was never his intention to cause distress or concern to them by anything that he ever said or did.

‘He would therefore like to apologise sincerely for any such intrusion and assure them that this would have been inadvertent.’

Miss Goldsworthy told Channel 4 News: ‘I am relieved that some acceptance has now started to come forward from Chris Rennard that what he did was not okay, but very frustrated that I have had to spend the last 15 months talking about things that are really very private and quite intimate to me.’

She urged Mr Clegg to kick the peer out of the Lib Dem party.

A Lib Dem spokesman said three of the women have appealed against the outcome of Mr Webster’s investigation. Lord Rennard has appealed against part of the disciplinary process. ‘We cannot comment further on any aspect of that process while it is on-going,’ the spokesman added.
