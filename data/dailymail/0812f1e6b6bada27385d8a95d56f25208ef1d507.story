Academy graduate Lloyd Isgrove has signed a two-year contract extension at Southampton.

Having joined Saints aged nine, the midfielder has this season gone onto make four first-team appearances for the club.

Isgrove, now 22, has seen such progress rewarded by a contract extension until 2017, having previously penned successive one-year deals at St Mary's.

'It's a bit of security,' the Welsh midfielder told Southampton's official YouTube channel. 'I'm 22 now so obviously this takes me to 24.

'It won't stop me working hard and pushing in training. That's a good age to be playing at a high level.

'It shows that they believe in my abilities. They want me on a two-year instead of doing the one-years that I've previously done before, which is only positive for me.

'It's probably the biggest two years of my career so far. If I can get a run of games and stuff, I can really push on and really establish myself as a professional player.'

Isgrove's new deal takes him up to the age of 24 and he hopes he can establish himself as a professional
