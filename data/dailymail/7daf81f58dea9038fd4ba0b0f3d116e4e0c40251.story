The U.S. Air Force has launched an internal investigation after a disturbing photo of 15 airmen posing with a live soldier chained up in an open casket with a noose around his neck surfaced online.

The photo, dated August 23, appeared on Facebook in early October, with the caption: 'Da Dumpt, Da Dumpt... Sucks 2 Be U' scribbled on the bottom.

Published in the Air Force Times this week, the image has sparked outrage from soldiers and military wives and widows, appalled by the display.

Disturbing: The photo, dated August 23, shows a group of airmen at Air Education and Training Center at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas

The photo shows the group of male and
female soldiers wearing fatigues crossing their arms to make 'X' signs as they gather around a fellow airman who appears lifeless lying in a metal casket used to transport fallen soldiers.

Air Force Times reports a former 
soldier who saw the photo on the social networking website forwarded it 
to friends, including Staff Sergeant Elias Bonilla of the 82nd Airborne 
Division.

Sergeant Bonilla emailed the photo to
the Times with a note reading: 'I cannot help but picture the faces of 
my dead [soldiers] that we drug out of burning vehicles, dug out from 
collapsed buildings.'

The soldiers' names have not yet been
released. However, it is believed they are 'Port Dogs' who load planes, who were attending Air Transportation technical
school.

Investigation: It was reported last month the Air Force's mortuary at Dover Air Force Base had lost and mishandled the remains of hundreds of dead troops

Military officials said today they 
are from the 345th Training Squadron in Fort Lee, Virginia. Their unit 
is a detachment from a command at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.

Air Force Times reported an 
investigation was launched after it forwarded the photo to Air Education
and Training Command, the overall training command for the Air Force, 
for comment.

Air Force Secretary Michael Donley 
told the newspaper: 'We take this matter seriously. [Air Education and 
Training Command] has initiated a commander directed investigation.

'Such behaviour is not consistent with
our core values, and it is not representative of the Airmen I know. It 
saddens me that this may cause additional grief to the families of our 
fallen warriors.'

David E Smith, spokesman for the 
training command, told Air Force Times that the commander of the 37th 
Training Group at Lackland, Colonel Gregory Reese, was 'obviously 
displeased'.

However, it was not known at press 
time if any charges could be brought against the soldiers, or if any 
rules had been violated.

The intent of the photo had not been determined at press time.

But Air Force officers and military 
families have made clear its message was shockingly offensive, and are 
calling for the troops' dismissals.

Air Force Secretary Michael Donley 
said in a statement to the Times: 'Such behaviour is not consistent with 
our core values, and it is not representative of the Airmen I know. It 
saddens me that this may cause additional grief to the families of our 
fallen warriors.'

Air Force police officer Mike Hayes, commenting on the story, wrote: 'All these NCOs and Airman should be prosecuted and dismissed from
the military. This is disgraceful and disrespectful to all the men.'

Reader, Deedy Salie, who said she was
a military widow, commented: 'HOW DARE YOU! My husband came home in one
of those boxes, not on his own two feet like these disgraceful people 
will.. You not only offend my husband SFC David J. Salie, but his 
children, his wife, his family..........Hell, the entire nation. SHAME 
ON YOU! Each one should be stripped of rank and whatever else the Air Force can think of.. I'm beyond offended and ashamed of these "Airmen".......'

The investigation is expected to be completed in one to two weeks.

The shocking display comes a month 
after the Washington Post reported the Air Force's mortuary at Dover Air
Force Base, Delaware, had lost and mishandled the remains of hundreds 
of dead troops, sending them to for burial in a landfill in Virginia.

CNN reports a congressional panel 
investigating the actions of the Dover Air Force Base Mortuary will meet
for the first time next week.
