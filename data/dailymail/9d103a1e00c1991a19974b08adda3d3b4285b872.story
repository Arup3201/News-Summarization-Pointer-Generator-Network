Ukip general secretary Roger Bird has been cleared of improper conduct following an inquiry into allegations that he sexually harassed a would-be parliamentary candidate.

The party said it accepted Mr Bird's statement that a relationship between him and Natasha Bolter was 'consensual'. It also agreed that his actions did not compromise the integrity of its candidate selection process.

But Mr Bird and the party agreed that he will leave as general secretary because of the 'unfortunate publicity' surrounding Ms Bolter's complaint.

Ukip candidate Natasha Bolter and Roger Bird have both given interviews making allegations about their relationship since he was suspended over allegations of impropriety as general secretary

Mr Bird said: 'I am very glad that the party has investigated and dismissed the allegations of sexual harassment and any impropriety regarding the selection of Ms Bolter as a candidate.

'I wish Ukip every success in the election campaign. I remain a member and keen supporter of the party and I will continue to make every effort to help our candidates to victory in May.'

The row erupted when Ms Bolter accused Mr Bird of 'taking her down to the snooker room' at a club after a dinner in London and propositioning her on the day he interviewed her as a prospective candidate.

But he responded by revealing a string of intimate text messages he claimed she had sent him – including one which read: 'I love you and miss you and think you are sort of perfect.'

He insisted the messages proved that, far from sexually harassing her, the pair had actually been in a 'consensual' relationship.

But Ms Bolter, 39, responded furiously to his claims, accusing him of lying and insisting: 'I did not sleep with Roger Bird – end of.'

The ongoing scandal risks damaging Nigel Farage's claim to have professionalised his party

December 7: HR consultants produce a draft report. Mr Bird is suspended

December 8: Mr Bird's suspension becomes public. Ukip says: 'The party has acted swiftly and decisively and will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff'

But she admitted there were text messages. In an interview with BBC Two's Newsnight, recorded before Mr Bird released the content of texts, she said: 'There are texts between us.'

Asked if they were of an 'intimate nature' she replied: 'No.'

She added: 'Often I send a kiss after a text… you know like: see you later kiss kiss…I think that's a girl thing to do. But I don't think it is particularly intimate.'

One text message, which Mr Bird claimed was sent by Ms Bolter on November 2, said: 'I love u bird and wish u let me look after u. Hope u feel better xx.'

It has also emerged that she was still texting the party's general secretary her 'love or infatuation' a week after an investigation was launched.

Ms Bolter claims she raised he concerns with the party on November 5.

But it is understood that the investigation was triggered by another party member raising concerns about Mr Bird's handling of the candidate selection process on that date.

Senior Ukip insiders were furious at the way the pair's alleged affair had been played out in public.

A source told MailOnline: 'It would be better if they kept it private. Both of them now look like f***ing prats.'

But friends of Mr Bird hit back at the party hierarchy, saying Ukip itself had made the issue public by releasing a press statement about the disciplinary process.

'It's a bit rich for senior people in the party to be attacking Roger over this,' said one. 'It was Ukip who put this in the public domain with a press release. 

'This should have been a strictly confidential process, and if it had been left to Roger it would have been.

'But he was suddenly facing a very public allegation which he had to respond to.'

Doubts were cast on Ms Bolter's account of events, particularly why she continued sending Mr Bird affectionate text messages after the date she claimed to have raised concerns about him.

It also emerged she lied about studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University in the 1990s.

Ukip has repeatedly insisted it had tried to carry out a professional disciplinary investigation into Mr Bird's conduct.

It stressed that the issue of whether or not the couple slept together is not central to the investigation.

Mr Bird faced claims he 'marked up' Ms Bolter after her interviewing her about her suitability to be a candidate to ensure she made it on to the approved list.
