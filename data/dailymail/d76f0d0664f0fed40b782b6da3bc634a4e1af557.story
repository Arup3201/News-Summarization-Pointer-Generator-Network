Married couples should get ‘milestone’ tax breaks which would mean that the longer they stay together the less tax they pay, a senior judge suggested yesterday.

Sir Paul Coleridge said the allowances would reward families that remain stable and encourage couples facing a break-up to try to stick it out.

The system would also mean that couples who split up – often at high cost to the taxpayer – would be penalised.

High Court Judge Sir Paul Coleridge has suggested married couples should get milestone tax breaks

Family breakdown was recently estimated by the independent Relationships Foundation organisation to cost the State more than £40 billion a year – a figure including more than £18 billion in additional welfare benefits, £1.8 billion spent treating mental health problems and a social services bill of almost £5.5 billion.

Sir Paul floated the tax allowance proposal at a debate on cohabitation organised by the Marriage Foundation, the think-tank he chairs which campaigns for stable families.

He described the small-scale tax break that David Cameron will give to some married couples this spring as ‘ridiculous’, and asked: ‘Where is the incentive for people to stay together?’

Sir Paul, who retired as a full-time High Court family judge last year but who remains active on the bench, said: ‘Why not give people an incentive? People would know that if they were together for five years their tax allowances would get bigger, and it would get bigger still after ten years.

‘Couples who were on the point of breaking up would think that if they could stick it out for another two years or so there would be money in it for them.’

He added: ‘We need tax incentives and they would have a real effect on the way people behave. They would also reflect the reality that people who stay together do not cost the State much, whereas couples who split up cost the State an absolute fortune.’

A milestone tax break could be staged so newlyweds would have minor advantages over unmarried couples. But there could be increments to increase the tax allowances at five and ten years, possibly linked to the arrival of children.

By the time of a silver wedding anniversary after 25 years, a married couple would expect to enjoy a major income boost under the scheme compared to people their age who never married.

Mr Cameron promised a tax break for married couples at the 2010 election. The concession, which means that married couples and civil partners who are not higher rate taxpayers will be able to transfer £1,000 of their tax-free allowance to their spouse or partner, will apply from this April.

Analysts believe this will mean that around 1.6million people get just £3.85 a week, and 1.1million people will only see a benefit of £1.35 a week because the Coalition’s welfare reforms will take away the rest of the gain.

The Prime Minister’s Tory critics, including former chancellor Lord Lawson and former party chairman David Davis, have called for all married couples to be allowed to transfer income tax allowances to each other, to provide support for married families and partners who choose to be stay-at-home parents.

Sir Paul, one of the country’s most experienced family judges, has abandoned his former support for a law that would force cohabitees to accept financial duties to each other, a proposal that has near-universal backing among judges and lawyers.

He said it was dangerous to blur the distinction between marriage and cohabitation – as cohabitee couples are likely to split after three years, but the average divorce only takes place after 11 years.
