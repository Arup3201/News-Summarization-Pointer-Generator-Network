Primary school children have been told to wear only socks for lessons after shoes were banned in an attempt to improve children's results.

Holmbush Primary School in Shoreham, West Sussex, declared that children should study barefoot after the school's 'Learning Council', made up of Year Six pupils, found that 'shoeless classrooms' could help pupils learn.

After a trial, which was deemed successful by children and staff, the 240-pupil school's governors agreed to make the policy official, and Holmbush became a 'shoeless school' in January this year.

The unusual philosophy, which originated in Scandinavia, where shoes bring in slush, snow and ice, suggests that children both learn and behave better when their feet are unrestricted by shoes.

Pupils are said to be gentler with each other, concentrate better, and other benefits include cleaner and more hygienic carpets.

Pupils at Holmbush, which is deemed 'good' by Ofsted, are allowed to go barefoot or to wear socks and slippers whenever they are in the school building, and only put on school shoes when they head outdoors to play.

Headmistress Rebecca Jackson said: 'Shoeless classrooms were brought in to improve the learning environment.'

However children and staff discovered one downside of shoeless learning last week when a fire alarm sounded and the children had to file out onto the wet playground in their socks.

Some parents and carers were upset that the children got their feet wet as a result, with one grandmother of a five-year-old at the school saying: 'It’s absolutely ridiculous.

'Thee pupils were ushered out of the door without their shoes, and my grandson was stood there on a soaking wet playground in just his socks.

'When they came back into the school, they had to take their socks off, so when we went to collect the kids nearly all of them came out wearing shoes and no socks.'

She added: 'It is just disgusting. There are so many health hazards about kids walking about in socks on the wooden floors and chair legs slamming on their feet, but the reassurance we’ve been given is that posters are no longer stuck on walls with drawing pins.

'Even in hospitals you’re not allowed to walk about barefoot because of health and safety implications.'

Headteacher Rebecca Jackson said: 'The children’s safety is of the utmost importance, which is why we evacuated the building.

'During the afternoon, children with wet socks or tights were given spare dry ones and theirs were dried.'

She added: 'Shoeless classrooms have nothing to do with [protecting] the carpet tiles - we haven’t had any new carpets fitted since 2007.'
