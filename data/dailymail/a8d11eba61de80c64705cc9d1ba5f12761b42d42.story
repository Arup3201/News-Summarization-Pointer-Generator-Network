An officer has been cleared of any wrongdoing after he pushed his police dog through a speeding driver's passenger window whereupon it attacked the occupant.

The drama unfolded when Stafford Brister, of the Wilmington Police Department in North Carolina, gave chase to a persistent offender who had fled a DWI (driving while intoxicated) checkpoint on Halloween.

Now, dashboard video has emerged on Liveleaks showing Brister's patrol car pursuing Johnnie Williams the wrong way down a one-way street; Williams ramming a patrol car outside a cemetery; and officers eventually forcing him to crash.

Williams, who was taken to New Hanover Regional Medical Center with wounds to his face and shoulder, said he wasn't given a proper chance to surrender as the attack happened so quickly

K-9 patrolman Brister then shoved his dog through the side window and it attacked Williams, leading to lacerations on his face.

Fellow officers are seen smashing the driver's window and removing Williams, who had raised his hands, from the vehicle.

The incident has sparked a debate in the community over the issue of excessive force.

District Attorney Ben David said he wanted to put the case in front of a jury to decide if Brister should be charged with assault inflicting serious injury.

'I believed it was a close enough legal question that the community should decide whether the use of force was reasonable and I would not rule as a matter of law that it was,' he said.

Brister, however, was cleared of any wrongdoing by a New Hanover grand jury yesterday.

Williams has been indicted on charges including assault with a deadly weapon on a government official, being a habitual felon and traffic violations.

Brister has been put on administrative leave, with pay, pending the outcome of an internal investigation.

The dog involved, named Kass, has been placed with another K-9 officer until the investigation is finished.

Chief Ralph Evangelous said: 'Sometimes the job we do is not pretty.'Â
