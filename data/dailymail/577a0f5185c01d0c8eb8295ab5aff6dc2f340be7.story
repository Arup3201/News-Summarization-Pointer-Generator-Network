This is the moment a brazen burglar took time out during a raid on a beauty salon to count the money he was stealing from the till.  

The middle-aged intruder was caught on CCTV taking cash from the newly-opened Blush salon in Llandaff, Cardiff, after smashing his way into the shop with a brick.

Salon owner Vicky Thomas had only opened her business six weeks ago, and said she is devastated at the break-in.
