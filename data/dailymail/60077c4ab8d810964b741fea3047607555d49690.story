Aston Martin celebrated its 100th anniversary by unveiling a concept car inspired by the firm's famous Le Mans victory.

The CC100 Speedster Concept Car has been designed by Aston Martin to give 'glimpses of potential future design direction'.

But its main inspiration is from the iconic DBR1 racer which Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori drove to victory at the 1959 Le Mans.

The CC100 concept car made its global debut today, completing a lap of the famous Nordschleife at Germany's 24 Hours of Nurburgring race.

Aston Martin has fitted the CC100 with a 6-litre V12 engine - giving the roofless motor a 0-62mph time of four seconds and a top speed of 180mph.

It is understood the one-off rocket, which will be shown around the world as part of Aston Martin's 100th birthday celebrations, has been sold to a wealthy client for around £500,000.

Dr Ulrich Bez, boss of Aston Martin, drove the CC100 at the Nurburgring.

He was joined by British racing legend Sir Stirling Moss, who was behind the wheel of the original DBR1 when it won the 1,000km race at The 'Ring in 1959.

Dr Bez said: 'CC100 is the epitome of everything that is great about Aston Martin.

'It represents our fantastic sporting heritage, our exceptional design capability, our superb engineering know-how and, above all, our adventurous spirit.

'I have nicknamed it 'DBR100' because of its affinity to the great 1959 race-winning cars and, of course, our 100-year anniversary in 2013.

Inspired: The new six litre car is seen as an example of where the company could go with design in the future

'But this car is more, even, than a 
simple "birthday present" to ourselves: it shows that the soul of Aston 
Martin - the thing that differentiates us from all the other car makers 
out there - is as powerful as ever and I very much hope that everyone 
who catches a glimpse of it at the Nurburgring today enjoys seeing it.'

The original DBR1 is now regarded as one of the most valuable cars in the world with Ascot dealer Talacrest advertising it for £20 million last year.

At the time, Talacrest boss John Collins called the DBR1 'the holy grail of motoring', and 'the most recognisable and valuable Aston Martin in history'.

Classic: Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori drove the 1959 Le Mans DBR1 racer to victory

Iconic: The iconic design has become a symbol of Aston Martin, which is why it has been recreated in the anniversary car

The CC100 concept was designed and built in less than six months at Aston Martin's global headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire.

Measuring
almost four and a half metres nose to tail, and more than two metres 
wide, the Speedster is made from lightweight carbon fibre.

Miles Nurnberger, chief exterior designer, said: 'The brief was very simple, yet enormously testing: create something that reflects the 100 years of Aston Martin heritage and signals the future of the brand.

Smooth lines: The 1959 Aston martin DB4 is one of the most iconic designs the company has produced, with its sleek lines and comfortable interior

'The idea of an iconic speedster concept that nods to the Le Mans - and Nurburgring - winning cars of 1959 soon came, and we have had complete freedom to shape this car.'

Marek Reichman, design director, added: 'I'm extremely proud of the entire team at Gaydon for creating this remarkable sports car concept in such a short time.

'The need to create a truly fitting tribute to 100 years of the Aston Martin brand has brought out the creativity and talent that makes Aston Martin such an exceptional luxury sports car maker.'
