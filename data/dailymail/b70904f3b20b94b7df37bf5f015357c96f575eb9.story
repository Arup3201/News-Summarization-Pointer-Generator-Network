A disabled two-year-old has been left housebound after thieves stole hundreds of pounds worth of specialist equipment from her parents’ car days before Christmas.

Audrey Frantzich cannot walk, talk or eat due to a rare genetic condition and needs an oxygen supply and expensive mobility equipment to help her live.  

She has to be fed milk through a tube in her stomach and relies on specialist aids just to help her sit up.

Condition: The two year old suffers from a rare genetic condition which means she cannot sit up, walk or talk

Now her parents Louise, 28, and Herman, 24, are unable to take her out after thieves stole their car containing her special car seat, buggy, chair and oxygen canister.

The culprits later abandoned the car but kept the equipment – and even the vehicle’s disabled badge.

They also held on to the family’s sat nav and a camera full of irreplaceable photographs charting Audrey’s life.

Mrs Frantzich said the Rover was stolen on Saturday from the garage attached to the family’s bungalow in Baildon, West Yorkshire. She said: ‘We feel really shocked and upset that people would do that, especially around Christmas time.

‘When they saw the oxygen and the disabled badge in the car, they would have had an idea. How would they feel if it was their disabled child who was left without?

‘It’s had a huge impact on our life over Christmas. We wanted to go out and do things with Audrey, but we’ve not been able to because the buggy we would have put her in was stolen.’

Audrey’s condition means that she has spinal problems, hearing aids in each ear, a cleft palate and suffers from reflux, where acid from the stomach leaks into the gullet.

She cannot sit up properly and finds it hard to hold her head upright, meaning she needs a special seat or buggy to support her.

Audrey has to have constant medical attention, so the stolen equipment was vital for her travel to hospital appointments.

Her parents estimate they have lost £350 worth of equipment, not including the oxygen canister which was provided by the NHS.

Her mother added: ‘They’ve even taken the fleece blanket I bought to keep her warm when we go out.

The rare genetic condition has a range of symptoms.

The disorder means people have the entire 9th chromosome three times rather than twice in some cells of the body.

‘It’s been awful for Audrey, she’s 
quite social and loves to go out and about and see different places, but
 because we’ve been stuck in she’s been really unsettled.

‘I don’t know how we would have managed if there was an emergency and we needed to get to hospital.

Appointment: The car and equipment is needed so Audrey can be taken to a hospital appointment at Bradford Royal Infirmary on Friday

‘It’s
 going to be a struggle getting to hospital appointments without 
everything that has been stolen and we’ll even struggle to park because 
the disabled badge has gone.’

Audrey’s great-grandmother Barbara Seed, 78, added: ‘How can people be so cruel? Audrey’s such a happy and lovely little soul.’

Police
 recovered the car on the same day that it was stolen and arrested three
 people, but the items were not in it or found during a search of the 
suspects’ homes.

It is 
thought only about ten children in the UK have Audrey’s condition, 
Trisomy 9 Mosaic (T9M), which is caused by having a partial third copy 
of a chromosome.

Audrey’s 
mother added: ‘When she was born, doctors said she wouldn’t see her 
first birthday. She has a lot of problems, but she’s always quite 
jolly.’

Mrs Frantzich is a 
full-time carer for her daughter. Her American-born husband cannot work 
as he is waiting for his national insurance number, after obtaining a 
visa.

The family’s financial situation, and a £500 insurance excess, means they will struggle to replace the stolen items.

A
 police spokesman said two women, aged 18 and 25, have been released 
without charge and a 24-year-old man has been released on bail pending 
further inquiries.
