A baby orangutan finally has the strength to sit up and feed himself fruit after being caged in a chicken coop and fed only condensed milk for most of his short life.

Tiny Budi stole hearts around the world when his horrific story of neglect at the hands of his owner was revealed by MailOnline. Now donations to the charity nursing him back from the brink of death have now topped £20,000 - many of them from kind-hearted readers.

Vets from the British animal welfare charity said he is strong enough to lift a bottle of milk to his mouth and suck the juice from pieces of fruit.

He was rescued in Indonesia by a Sussex-based charity from a hellish life as a family pet and cried like a human baby during the journey to his new home.

Strength: The tiny orangutan can now lift a bottle of milk if it is not too heavy and can sit up on his own

Since the baby orangutan's plight was publicised, he has become an international celebrity and his story has prompted the biggest response for an individual appeal ever witnessed by International Animal Rescue, the charity that brought him to safety in his native Borneo.

Lis Key, from International Animal Rescue, said: 'When MailOnline reported the story of Budi the baby orangutan on January 22, it triggered a huge wave of response from the public and media across the world. 

'Budi has appeared on websites, blogs and TV in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and America.

'Celebrities including Fearne Cotton, Joss Stone and Ricky Gervais have tweeted about Budi – and charity International Animal Rescue has received a staggering £20,000 in donations towards the appeal to help treat and care for the little baby.

'The charity is aiming to double that amount in the weeks ahead to cover the costs of Budi's care for what is likely to be six or seven years of rehabilitation before he can even be considered for release into the wild. 

'And if little Budi doesn't regain the strength he will need to fend for himself in the forest, International Animal Rescue will have to cope with the costs of caring for him in their sanctuary for the rest of his life.

'And the latest news is that, slowly but surely, Budi is on the mend.'

The charity estimates it will cost about £5,000 a year to care for the little orangutan. Although he is in a stable condition, he is still not out of the woods and simple tasks exhaust him.

Before Budi was rescued, his owner hadn't given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him.

Her ignorance and neglect were killing the baby slowly and painfully, but she eventually told authorities she wished to hand Budi over.

'We just hope we got to him in time and that someday, although it will be a long time from now, he will be able to live in the forest as a normal orangutan' 

Alan Knight OBE, the CEO of International Animal Rescue charity said: 'He was deprived of all the nutrients that are vital to the development of a young baby.

'His little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent. 

'He was completely unable to move or even sit up on his own. At more than a year old he should have been strong enough to climb and swing: instead he was as helpless as a newborn baby.

'When our team lifted Budi out of his cage in Kubing in Borneo to prepare him for the journey to our rescue centre ten hours away in Sungai Awan, his eyes literally filled with tears and he cried in agony.

'Everyone was distressed beyond words to see how much pain he was in. I don't know how much longer he could have endured so much suffering.'

Budi had severe anaemia and months of malnutrition had left his joints swollen and badly deformed. He also had to be treated for a serious metabolic disease that may have caused permanent damage to his bones.

The little orangutan could only sit up on his own for short periods and could not move his arms and legs fully.

Vet Christine Nelson now reports that Budi continues to improve every day.

She said: 'Each milestone achieved is a wonder, but we remember that it's all relative. 

'The swelling and pain in his body has receded, but this has revealed the misshapen and weak muscles of his arms and legs.

International Animal Rescue, based in Uckfield, East Sussex saves animals, big and small, from suffering around the world.

Work includes freeing and caring for dancing bears in India, rescuing primates from captivity in Indonesia, and sterilising and vaccinating stray dogs and cats in developing countries.

Wherever possible, the charity returns rescued animals to their natural environment but it also provides a permanent home for those that can no longer survive in the wild.

International Animal Rescue works to educate the public in the compassionate and humane treatment of all animals. Sound scientiﬁc evidence forms the basis of its decision-making and determines the course of its rescue operations.

It also works with other like-minded organisations and government departments to strengthen legislation to protect animals from cruelty and neglect.

'Budi can lift a small bottle of milk to drink on his own now, but only if it's not too full or heavy. 

'He is trying new foods all the time, and he is willingly opening his mouth to eat, but we are blending his food because he still hasn't learned how to chew. However he enjoys sucking the juice out of slices of fruit.

'We are excited that Budi can now sit up on his own for short periods of time before dropping off to sleep with the effort. 

'The team remains optimistic, as Budi has a strong spirit and is being provided with supplements, vitamins and the care he needs to correct his abnormalities and help him continue to develop. 

'We just hope we got to him in time and that someday, although it will be a long time from now, he will be able to live in the forest as a normal orangutan.'
