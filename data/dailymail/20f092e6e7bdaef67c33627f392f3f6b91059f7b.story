Mitt Romney lost the election after an ‘extraordinary’ collapse in support among white men, the very group the Republicans counted on to turn out for him.

As the official inquest into the defeat got underway, the former Presidential candidate’s own pollster revealed his lead among white males was cut from 27 points to as low as 12 points.

Staff revealed that nobody had even read Clint Eastwood’s speech at the Republican National Convention which caused them deep embarrassment.

Failed campaign: Mitt Romney's staff found that he lost an 'extraordinary' number of white, male votes during the election - traditionally key supporters of the Republican party

And in another blow, Romney’s own campaign manager also admitted that his infamous 47 per cent comment was ‘the epitome of low during the campaign’ - from which they never recovered.

After his defeat Romney was rounded on by the Republican party which blamed him for his defeat to President Obama by a margin of 332 to 206 electoral college votes.

The President lost just two states compared to his landslide in 2008.

Romney has spent the last month in solitude at his beachfront mansion in La Jolla near San Diego in California as he reflects upon what went wrong.

Now Neil Newhouse, his campaign pollster, has begun to sift through the data to determine what the key factors were.

He said that he had to give ‘credit’ to the Obama campaign for getting out the Latino and African- American vote, and praised the President’s so-called ‘ground game’ for being extremely effective.

He said: ‘We weren’t surprised by racial composition; we were surprised by the partisan composition...The
 real hidden story here on our side, the number of white men who didn’t 
vote in this election compared to four years ago was extraordinary.

‘And
 these white men were replaced by white women. We were taking a group we
 won by 27 points and replacing them with a group we won by 12-14 
points.’

Speaking to ABC News, Romney strategist and RNC director Russ Schrieffer admitted that Eastwood’s speech had not been cleared.

The
 Dirty Harry star went on to make a bizarre, rambling appearance in 
which he talked to an empty chair, pretending it was President Obama.

The speech was much lampooned and overshadowed Romney, who came on stage immediately afterwards.

Schrieffer said: ‘I said [to 
Eastwood] are you going to do what we talked about, are you going to 
talk about what you talked about at these fundraisers. And he looked at 
me and said.. ‘Yep.’

‘It’s Clint Eastwood, you argue with him.’

Rambles: Clint Eastwood's bizarre speech at the Republican National Convention in August, where he addressed a chair as Obama, overshadowed Romney's appearance, staff said

In an interview with Talking Points 
Memo, Romney’s campaign manager Matt Rhoades said the candidate’s 47 per
 cent comment at a behind closed doors fundraiser became a real problem.

He said that they put in place a five-point plan to rebuild Romney’s image but he was unable to recover.

Rhoades
 said that they tried to ‘gin up our surrogate load’ by sending 
high-profile Romney supporters across the country to ‘speak to the 
governor’s character'.

Big 
speeches were lined up and Romney was asked to speak in front of a 
podium instead of walking around the stage - but in the end it all came 
to nothing.

Taking time out: Mitt Romney with wife Ann over Thanksgiving as the former presidential candidate contemplates his future

As he begins to re-enter public life Romney has taken up his first job since losing the election and rejoined the board of Marriott hotels.

He will earn a package of up to $170,000 a year for the post, which he stepped down from in January last year.

Prior to that he had been languishing at home emailing friends and even offering to care for one who had gone through a liver transplant and change his bedpan.

Romney celebrated Thanksgiving with his family but bought the dinner at Boston Market because there were so many relatives he and wife Ann could not cook for them all.
