Courageous celebrity chef Matt Golinski has revealed how his life has turned around and is 'full of many different things' almost two and a half years after he tragically lost his wife and three daughters in a Boxing Day house fire.

Since the tragedy in 2011, which left him hospitalised for four months with third degree burns over 40 per cent of his body, Golinski has been undergoing extensive rehabilitation.

It's rumoured that the 42-year-old also moved in with his personal trainer girlfriend Erin Yarwood in November 2013.

And Golinski has revealed his life is back on track and he feels 'great' after appearing at Noosa International Food and Wine Festival in his Queensland hometown on Friday.

The celebrity chef community were quick to rally around him after he was unable to work at first.

A team of six chefs led by Manu Feildel, who Golinski met while working on Ready, Steady, Cook, organised two charity fundraising cruises for the him and other burns victims.

Their campaign raised more than $100,000.

Bravely showing his scars, he revealed how he's put his life back together after the horrific ordeal at his old home in Jacaranda Place, in Tewantin on the Sunshine Coast.

'I've been doing a lot of cooking and a lot of writing and recipe development,' he said.

'I've been working and I've been doing a lot of running.'

His long road to recovery means he's 'still got a couple of operations in the next couple of months'.

Previously, in his first interview after the tragedy, which took the lives of his wife, Rachael, and daughters Starlia, 10, and 12-year-old twins, Willow and Sage, the foodie said he believed he survived for a reason.

However, he claimed he was still trying to figure out what that reason was.

'I have no idea why I was spared from the fire but I am determined to look forward and live a life that would make them proud,' he told The Courier-Mail.

'I want to honour the memory of Rachael and our girls by finding a silver lining somewhere in these dark clouds,' he added.

'To say my world has been turned upside down is an understatement. Although the loss of my family is unfathomable, at this stage of my recovery, I am simply grateful to be alive and to have experienced the love of my beautiful wife and three daughters.'  

The brave chef returned to Noosa Food and Wine Festival for the 11th time on Friday, which he says is always 'good to be part of'.

Straight from his busy day in the kitchen he then drove on to Hampton Food and Wine Festival, near Toowoomba, Queensland.
