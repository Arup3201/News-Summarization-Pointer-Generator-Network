Newcastle United will not be making an application to sign a goalkeeper on emergency loan after Jak Alnwick was passed fit for Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby.

The 21-year-old injured his shoulder during Wednesday night’s 4-0 defeat at Spurs and there had been fears he could miss the visit of Sunderland, leaving 17-year-old Freddie Woodman as their only fit keeper.

But Alnwick will now make his first start at St James’ Park in this weekend’s derby after being cleared of any serious damage.

That means Newcastle’s plans to appeal to the Premier League for permission to bring in another goalkeeper have now been put on hold. 

Alnwick is deputising in the absence of the injured Tim Krul and Rob Elliot, neither of whom are expected to return until the middle of January at the earliest.
