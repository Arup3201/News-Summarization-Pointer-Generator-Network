Brussels bureaucrats want to stop British children being given cheese and yogurt at school.

The European Union says the move is part of a healthy-eating campaign designed to tackle obesity.

But UK health experts and farmers have attacked the plan, saying the EU is wrong to ‘demonise’ dairy products.

Brussels provides £8¿million a year for UK school breakfast clubs, morning snacks and lunch, and children can be given milk, yogurt, cheese and fruit

If the change is implemented, however, only milk and fresh produce will be on the menu.

EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos says that it is an ‘important measure for bringing about sustained changes in children’s eating habits’.

But Jenny Stratford, president of the Women’s Food and Farming Union, said cheese and yogurt were a vital part of a healthy diet.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘Cheese is hugely beneficial for children. It gives them calcium and helps with bone development.

‘Yogurt can have high levels of sugar but if it’s low fat and low sugar, it’s fine.’

The proposal is included in a shake-up of European programmes which subsidise school food. The EU wants the £190 million annual grant, shared by all member states, to focus on fruit and vegetables.

But Conservative MP and Devon farmer Neil Parish said: ‘If you don’t give children food they like at school they are more likely to eat takeaways.

'We’ve got too hung up about fat and sugar content. Children need them for energy, and cheese and yogurt provide that.’

Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK, added: ‘It seems wrong that children who may not be milk drinkers and prefer to consume yogurt or cheese may not have access to these products.’
