After Liverpool and Arsenal's drama in the Capital One Cup Third Round, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham are still to enter the fray. 

Here, Sportsmail previews the remaining third round fixtures.

Burton v Brighton 

Adam McGurk is an injury doubt for League Two Burton Albion as they bid to extend their unlikely cup run when Brighton visit the Pirelli Stadium. McGurk struck a brilliant free-kick to knock out Queens Park Rangers in the last round with Wigan defeated before that. But Burton have lost their last two League games to slip off top spot. ‘We’ve got to make sure we react positively,’ said manager Gary Rowett.

Burton (4-4-2): McLaughlan; Edwards, Cansdell-Sherriff, Taft, Sharps; Mousinho, Weir, Palmer, Harness; McGurk, Beavon. 

Brighton (4-3-3): Stockdale; Bruno, Greer, Dunk, Bennett; Crofts, Holla, Forster-Caskey; Mackail-Smith, Baldock, LuaLua.

Chelsea v Bolton

Jose Mourinho will make a host of changes against Bolton, with Petr Cech in line for his first Chelsea start of the season.

Loic Remy could also make his full debut since arriving from Queens Park Rangers as Mourinho shuffles his pack. Aston Villa and Australia defender Chris Herd, 25, has joined Bolton on a one-month loan and is expected to go straight into their line-up at right-back.

With our aspirations, we hope that this will be a League fixture in the near future.’ For Spurs, Andros Townsend has recovered from a thigh injury, which ruled him out against West Brom.
