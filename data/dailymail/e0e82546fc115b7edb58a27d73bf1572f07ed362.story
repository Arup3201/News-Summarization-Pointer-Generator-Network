This community in southeast China is home to 7,000 fishermen refusing to conform to modern lives, remaining in their traditional floating homes on the sea.

The Tanka people, also called boat people or 'gypsies of the sea' can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty where local fishermen settled on their vessels to avoid wartime chaos on the mainland.

The floating fishermen's village is located in Ningde City in southeast China’s Fujian province.

Village on the sea: The people follow ancient traditions and rules as they farm different types of fish which they sell on to the mainland

It has the longest coastline in Fujian
 and the largest mudflat in China, home to thousands of Tanka families 
who have been living on their fishing boats or in floating houses for 
generations.

Their
 living habits date back to the Tang Dynasty, around 700AD, when 
fishermen in east Fujian settled on their boats to avoid the chaos 
caused by war.

These 
fishermen were named the 'gypsies on the sea', rarely stepping onto the 
mainland, and instead living their lives on the waves.

Ancient: The floating villages date back to the Tang Dynasty circa 700AD when fishermen moved out onto their boats to avoid the wars of the mainland

Modern moves: Although they are now allowed to live on the mainland, many of the thousands of fishermen remain in their floating homes

Before the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, the ‘gypsies of the sea’ were not allowed to go ashore or marry the people living along the beach.

Everything from weddings to funeral ceremonies were instead held on the boats.

In recent years, with the help of the local government, the fishermen have started to build houses along the shoreline.

However, many of them prefer to still live out on the sea on their floating homes as is their people’s tradition.
