A tractor-trailer driver may have been lost when he turned on to tracks and caused a fiery collision with an LA commuter train on Tuesday. 

Four people were critically injured and several carriages overturned in the early morning derailment in Ventura County, California.

A total of 28 passengers suffered injuries when four cars of a Southern California Metrolink train tumbled onto their sides after slamming into a truck which burst into flames.

There were no fatalities but passengers suffered spinal, head and neck injuries along with fractures.

Authorities said the truck driver, a 54-year-old man from Yuma, Arizona, had ran off but was later arrested.

The truck driver, who has not been named, was being treated at a local medical center for minor injuries. He is being questioned by police.

Officials initially said that the driver had stopped his produce truck on the tracks and the accident was 'avoidable'. 

However at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Oxnard police Officer Miguel Lopez said the man may have accidentally turned on to the tracks and become stuck became he did not know the area. 

When police first responded to the scene they found the tractor-trailer 'engulfed in flames'. 

Once fire crews extinguished the blaze, police found the cabin of the truck empty. It was also not clear if the truck was carrying any produce at the time of the crash. 

A patrol cop later found a 'disorientated man' walking along the side of the road and who was confirmed to be the driver.  

Authorities described the driver as 'unsettled' but would not say if he was under the influence of alcohol or substances. It was also unclear if the driver was properly licensed.

The crash was reported at 5.44am on Tuesday, according to officials. Some 51 people were traveling on board the train to LA at the time.

According to the LA Times, three of the four train carriages had a 'crash energy management'.

Metrolink's website explains that since 2010, 117 new cars used by the rail company have had the latest safety technology which included redesigned seats, work tables and 'energy absorbing' zones at the ends of cars.  

One overturned train carriage was lying half on the tracks and half on the highway running parallel to the train line.

Some passengers were treated in triage areas set up at the scene while others were taken by ambulance to local hospitals.

Firefighters and emergency responders were seen treating numerous people at the scene, ABC7 reported.

Metrolink's website says the train was on a run from Ventura County to Los Angeles. 

Metrolink tweeted: 'VC Line 102 to Los Angeles is stopped between Oxnard & Camarillo due to striking a vehicle on the tracks.'

The company canceled trains on the line on Tuesday and encouraged commuters to seek alternative transport. 

The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a 'go-team' on Tuesday to the scene of the accident.

The scene is in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles. 

Prior to Tuesday's collision of a Metrolink train with a tractor-trailer in Ventura County, the Southern California rail company has had several major accidents. Tuesday's accident left around 30 people injured but no fatalities, according to fire chiefs. 

In 2002, two people were killed and 22 other passengers seriously injured when a BNSF freight train hit a Metrolink train in Placentia, California, head-on.

Three years later, a crash in Glendale, California (pictured right), killed 11 people and left more than 100 injured with 40 passengers left in a serious condition. 

A Metrolink passenger train hit a vehicle on the tracks, jackknifed and smashed into a freight locomotive and a Metrolink train traveling the opposite way.

The driver of the vehicle left on the tracks in 2005 was charged with 11 counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole in June 2008.

In 2008, 26 people were killed and 135 injured when a train collided with a Union Pacific freight train and toppled carriages in the Chatsworth neighborhood of LA. 

The driver of the tractor-trailer which was on the tracks reportedly ran off but was caught, authorities said
