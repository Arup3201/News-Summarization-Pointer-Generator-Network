Police in Pakistan have re-arrested the terrorist leader believed to be behind the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 which left 166 people dead.

Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi had been due to leave jail today after a judge granted him bail on December 18, but was immediately rearrested by authorities on another case, his lawyer said. 

Lakhvi is one of seven suspects being tried by Pakistan in connection with the attacks, which involved four days of bombings and gunmen taking hostages in the city's Taj Mahal Hotel.

He was due to be released just days after Pakistani officials rebuked the makers of U.S. series Homeland for depicting the capital Islamabad as a 'hellhole' full of terrorists.

Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi had been due to leave jail today after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to hold him over the Mumbai terror attacks, but was rearrested this morning on a different charge

Officials scenes showing bombs going off in Islamabad and bodies scattered through the streets were an 'insult', adding that 'nothing could be further from the truth'.

Over the weekend Indian officials also branded Pakistan as a 'haven for terrorists' as news of Lakhvi's immediate release from jail spread, saying officials had 'strong concerns' over the decision.

Appearing in court in Islamabad amid tight security, Lakhvi today told reporters that he would accept whatever God intended for him. 

Police inspector Mohammed Arshad told the court that someone had filed a complaint at a police station on the Islamabad outskirts saying that Lakhvi had abducted his brother-in-law to wage 'jihad' six and a half years ago. 

The judge granted a police request for time to investigate the accusation, extending Lakhvi's detention for two days.

However, Rizwan Abbasi, Lakhvi's lawyer, called it a tactic to '....deprive my client of the fundamental right of liberty.'

On December 18 a judge at the country's anti-terror court had agreed to grant Lakhvi bail saying there was a lack of evidence to justify holding him.

The move had angered and embarrassed government officials as they had just vowed to crack down on terror groups following the Peshawar school attack days earlier. 

The fresh assault, in which 132 schoolchildren died, provoked a harsh condemnation from India, which has repeatedly said Pakistan is not doing enough to stop terror groups. 

Despite efforts by Pakistan's legal chiefs to keep Lakhvi behind bars, a judge on Monday said there was no reason to detain him, and asked him to post bail. 

Pakistani television reported that senior officials met last night at the Interior Ministry to discuss the case, before Lakhvi was arrested hours later.

Lakhvi is one of the leaders of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terror group whose name translates as Army of the Righteous, which accepted responsibility for the Mumbai attacks.

Over the course of four days members of Lashkar-e-Taiba detonated bombs at busy locations around the city, while gunmen took hostages inside the iconic Taj Mahal Hotel.

In total 166 people were killed, while another 300 were wounded, dramatically worsening relations between India and Pakistan.
