A 13-year-old cancer sufferer has passed away just two days after she returned from her dream trip to Paris.

Emma Grace Findley, from Franklin, Indiana, had always told her mother, Kari Findley, that she wanted to go to the French capital for her 16th birthday.

But after she was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in September, the Indiana Children's Wish Fund worked to make her dream come true far sooner, and the family took the trip last week. 

Yet just a day after she returned on Monday, Emma suffered a seizure and was rushed to hospital, where she never regained consciousness, the IndyStar reported.

Her family took her home on Wednesday.

'Our precious Emma Grace is in heaven now,' her aunt, Megan Taylor, posted to Facebook on Thursday.  

Her death comes just three months after Emma started suffering from headaches and nausea. After a routine eye exam revealed some abnormalities, she was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an inoperable brain tumor.

She underwent radiation and chemotherapy, but tests recently revealed the tumor had grown. She was expected to undergo further treatment when she returned from Paris.

The Indiana Children's Wish Fund, which grants wishes for critically ill children, worked to give Emma her dream trip.

With her parents, Kari and Cal, and their nine-year-old twins Sam and Sophie, Emma jumped into a limousine on December 8 and took off for France for a week.  

'I'm looking forward to the cheese and bread over there. And the chocolate,' Emma told the IndyStar before they took the trip. 'I'm debating whether to try the wine.'

The family snapped photos of Emma grinning over dinners with her family and posing beneath the Eiffel Tower. They also visited the Louvre, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Notre Dame and the Palace of Versailles.

'Thank you to so many of you who gave to us to make Emma's trip even more special!' her mother wrote on Facebook after they returned.

Fighter: Emma underwent six weeks of chemotheraphy and radiation treatment but the tumor grew

'Your gift of love let us take a beautiful boat ride and lunch on the Seine River, sent us to the top of the Eiffel Tower and fed us all the crepes we could stuff in our faces!' 

She added: 'My gratitude runs deeper than imaginable.' 

After news of her death, family and friends flocked to Facebook to express their condolences.

'I hope you can take comfort in the wonderful memories of your beautiful girl,' one wrote. 'Emma's light shines even brighter now that she watches over you from Heaven.'
