For the first time ever more than half of Americans now own smartphones opposed to regular talk or text devices according to a new report.

With a U.S. population of 312 million, the report by Chetan Sharma Consulting finds smartphones now amassing over half of the country's population.

Adding to the boom, this year's second quarter sales reported by Sharma found that 70 per cent of phones purchased were either iPhones or androids, with the trend expected to rise.

Boom: More than half of Americans now own some kind of smartphone with androids overtaking Apple's iPhone (pictured) in sales in this last sales quarter

The mobile consulting firm supports an earlier finding by Nelsen this year that used polling data to find the number of smartphone users passing the 50 per cent mark.

Chetan Sharma compiled their figures using quarterly reports by the phone providers - the top four being Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel Corp, T-Mobile USA, AT&T.

Among the most popular smartphones in terms of sales between Apple's iPhone and the Android, the latter was found dominating in the last quarter.

Despite Apple racking in the highest device revenue and device profits, their iPhone sales dropped below Android's as U.S. consumers are believed to be waiting for the release of the iPhone 5 - now rumoured to be in early September.

Options: Smaller carriers of smartphones outside the U.S.' top four of Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile and AT&T have also managed to tap into the market boom, like Cricket (pictured)

Other smaller carriers are said to be tapping into the smartphone boom as well, however, with Gigaom reporting regional operators like MetroPCS, Cricket Communications and U.S. Cellular pulling forward with the help of cheaper phones.

That price trend could prove a lesson with the example of China whose China Mobile currently leads in global profit shares thanks in part analysis say to its lesser known local firms offering cheaper phones.

No surprise for China, in March it became the first nation to sign its billionth mobile subscription.

India, celebrating their own boom in February, stamped out its 900th million subscription, according to Sharma, approximately one year after clocking 20 million subscriptions per month at a historical rate.

Champion: Competing on the global scale, China Mobile is the reigning leader in global profit shares, just before the U.S.' top four, with the company seeing its billionth mobile subscriber in March

Apple, having a rougher capture of Chinese subscribers, offers their iPhone at a price around $800 that's the equivalent to about two months pay for an urban Chinese, according to Reuters. Those individuals are said to make up half of China's 1.3 billion population.

Industry researcher IDC estimates that in China last year, smartphones costing less than $200 made up 40 per cent of shipments, while devices costing $700 and more accounted for 11 per cent of the market.

'The sweet spot of affordability in China is $130-$240,' said Michael Clendenin, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy RedTech Advisors. 'The 'Lao Bai Xing,' or man on the street, is going to go for these mid-tier phones.'

Price appeal: China's appeal to its consumers is credited to its variety of smartphones to choose from with a range of prices

Back in the U.S. there has also been a decline in contract costumers with a net of 405,000 added to the four major carriers - less than half collected the same quarter one year ago.

Among providers, AT&T has sold the most iPhones making up roughly 47 per cent of the iPhones in the U.S.

T-Mobile, who's currently without the iPhone, is believed to be shaping up to carry it in the near future, according to the report.

The next U.S. Wireless Data Market update is expected in November while the next global update is expected in October.
