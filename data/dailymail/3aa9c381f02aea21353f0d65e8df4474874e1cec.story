Nestled in a pretty Yorkshire village is an award-winning garden, filled with hanging baskets and rustic planters.

It is the last place you would expect to find a feud so bitter it ended up in court – where it was labelled bizarre and disturbing.

But the garden’s owner Danuta Cross, 64, has accused her neighbours of stalking her, and has herself been convicted of harassment.

The horticultural hostilities were revealed this week as Cross pleaded guilty to yelling abuse at former civil servants Alexandra Smith, 65, and David Myhill, 59.

Their bungalow, with its well-kept garden, sits next door to hers in South Cave, East Yorkshire. Cross claims the couple are bullying her because they resent her gardening abilities.

Michael Copeman, defending, told Beverley magistrates’ court: ‘It is a very bizarre case . . . She has made complaints over a long period of time that she was being stalked.

'Whenever she is in her garden, the neighbours come out and stand at the side of the hedge and follow her about.’ 

He said police had been investigating, but had so far found nothing to back up her claims.

‘This is a woman at the end of her tether. She feels she is being watched all the time,’ he said.

Cross, a past winner of the South Cave Gardening Competition, was described as a pillar of the community who raised £800 for the village war memorial fund by hosting a barbecue in her garden. 

District Judge Fred Rutherford called her outburst ‘somewhat disturbing’ and adjourned sentencing until October 29.

Yesterday, Cross said she was ‘extremely upset and shaken’. 

She added: ‘I’ve had problems with my neighbours and it’s ongoing. It’s been going on a long time now.’

Outside court, she said: ‘It was completely out of character for me. I am stressed and terrified because I have never had to deal with a situation like this . . . I don’t want to be in my own home and I am thinking of moving.’ 

Last night Mr Myhill said: ‘We don’t wish to comment while there is still an ongoing legal process.’

A local man said: ‘There’s a bit of competition between the two houses, it all got out of hand. It’s a constant battle – everyone wants to have the prettier garden and I think there’s a bit of rivalry or jealousy.’
