Manchester United outcast Nani headed home the winner as Sporting Lisbon beat Penafiel 3-2 in the Portuguese league on Monday night.

The Portugal winger, who is on a season-long loan at his first club, took his Sporting goal tally to eight in 23 appearances since returning from Old Trafford.

The result kept them third in the Primeira Liga and on course for Champions League qualification, though their chances of bridging the 12-point gap to leaders Benfica are slim.

They were made to work hard by bottom-of-the-table Penafiel, who fought back from two goals down to draw level after Sporting centre-half Tobias Figueiredo was sent off.

Having come into the match off the back of a 3-0 loss to Porto, Sporting needed a positive start and goals from William and Islam Slimani had them two the good inside eight minutes.

But Figueiredo's red card gave the visitors hope and they replied through veteran midfielder Bruno Braga in the 12th minute.

And they levelled three minutes shy of half-time through Vitor Bruno.

However, Sporting were still too strong and Nani's winner - a firm header from 12 yards following a right-wing cross - proved decisive.

Frustrations ultimately boiled over for Penafiel, who are four points adrift at the bottom, as both Dani and Pedro Ribeiro were shown second yellow cards in the closing stages.
