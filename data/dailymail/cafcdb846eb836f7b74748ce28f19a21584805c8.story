Jon Stewart has delivered a blistering message to pundits who have used his Obamacare jokes to criticize U.S. President Barack Obama: 'Go f*** yourselves!'

The comedian played clips during Thursday night's 'Daily Show' of cable news talking heads discussing the impact of Stewart's mockery.

'Look, making fun of something, that's 
nothing new for us, so don't act like us making jokes 
about a certain program or president is evidence that that politician or
 issue has reached some kind of tipping point for action,' Stewart said.

Demolished: Jon Stewart trotted out a choir on Thursday night's 'Daily Show' to tell the media who used his comedy to criticize Obamacare: 'Go f*** yourselves.'

Stewart is known for skewering politicians on his show, however conservative commentators claim he is 'more sympathetic to' the Democrats.

So when the funnyman gave a scathing critique of the rollout of Obamacare on a recent show, saying 'Democrats can’t spin this turd', some pundits jumped on it.

Many questioned what effect 'losing Jon Stewart' would have on the national dialogue.

'When your political program becomes a punchline, you’ve got problems,' Howard Kurtz wrote for Fox News.

Some commentators also used Stewart's comedy routine to call for Obamacare's administrative chief, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, to step down over the website's botched delivery.

'When Jon Stewart and Saturday Night Live are making fun of the job you are doing, and the website, what that speaks to is the fact that young Americans are laughing at the Secretary and the website,' a Senator said on Fox News, TPM reported.

However, when that Senator suggested that 
Sebelius resign after being lampooned 
on television, Stewart joked: 'If that causes things to end, 
why was the network you were on still on the air?'

The anchor went on to question why former President George Bush didn't resign after constantly being mocked on TV.

It's a comedy show: Jon Stewart asked if laughing at federal officials meant it was time for those officials to step down, why didn't anyone mention that to former President George W. Bush or former Vice President Dick Cheney

That's when Stewart trotted out the choir and unleashed his scathing attack.

'The jokes that we do on this program seem to accomplish very little,' Stewart sang.

'They do perhaps provide a little catharsis or perspective maybe a little. But most of the things we complain about never change.

'Don't
 you use our jokes as evidence that the thing you hate must be stopped, 
because I'm sure when we joke about s*** you like, you're more than 
happy to ignore it.

'We add insult, not injury. GO F*** YOURSELVES!'
