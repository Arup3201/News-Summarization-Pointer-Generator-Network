An 80-year-old California man told a television station he shot dead a fleeing intruder who had begged for her life and claimed she was pregnant.

Tom Greer told a Los Angeles news station that he shot Andrea Miller twice in the back just outside his house, while she was running away on Tuesday night.

It is not yet clear if Greer will be arrested over the death, but Miller's alleged accomplice Gus Adams has been charged with her murder, police said Thursday.

Attack: Tom Greer says he was acting in self-defense when he shot dead a woman who broke into his Long Beach, California home on Tuesday

Suspects: Andrea Miller, left, was shot dead and Gus Adams has been arrested after the alleged break in

Greer claimed that he had returned home 
Tuesday night to find a man and woman breaking into his Long Beach home, and that 
the intruders had attacked him in the hallway.

He reportedly told KNBC on Wednesday: '[Miller] says, "Don't shoot me, I'm pregnant, I'm going to have a baby," andÂ  I shot her anyway.'

A coroner has not yet confirmed if the 28-year-old, from Long Beach, was actually pregnant.

Greer told NBC 4 he believes he was acting in self defense after Miller and her alleged accomplice Adams, 26, attacked him and broke his collarbone.

Adams, from Long Beach, has been arrested on suspicion of murder for taking part in a crime that led to Miller's death.

Police chief Jim McDonnell said the charge was possible because Adams was involved in a felony that led to a death. The police chief added that Greer was cooperating with the investigation.

Break in: Miller and Adams allegedly broke into Tom Greer's home on Tuesday night

Greer had claimed that he found Miller and Adams trying to open his safe and, while Adams was distracted, Greer reached for his revolver.

When the pair saw he was armed, they allegedly ran out of the house, but Greer told the TV station that he fired on them, hitting the woman.

He allegedly added he had no regrets about the shooting, telling KNBC: 'When the time comes to defend yourself, you best do something.'

Deputy police chief David Hendricks said: 'What we believe happened at this time is that a resident came home and possibly interrupted a crime in progress.

'At some point in time there was a shooting that took place and we have a suspect of that original crime deceased.'
