Ed Miliband yesterday rounded on the ‘powerful forces’ and ‘vested interests’ he believes are plotting to stop him entering Downing Street.

In a highly charged speech designed to draw a line under weeks of turmoil in Labour ranks, Mr Miliband risked accusations of paranoia as he insisted: ‘When powerful forces try to tell me “no way”, I answer: “who says?” ‘I’m willing to put up with whatever is thrown at me.’

Mr Miliband’s speech in London amounted to a passionate defence of his ability to lead his party and the country after some discontented Labour MPs suggested privately he should be replaced.

Labour leader Ed Miliband accuses Ukip of wanting to return Britain to a more unequal, more unjust past

The Labour leader’s personal ratings this week plunged to a record low – below even those of Michael Foot, the party’s least successful leader – and one poll put the Conservatives three points ahead.

Although only 13 per cent of people think he is up to being prime minister, Mr Miliband insisted he had the ‘resilience’ and ‘thick skin’ to do the job. 

He promised to talk more about the issue of immigration – which he forgot to mention in his disastrous party conference speech, along with the deficit – and attacked firms for ‘exploiting’ cheap migrant labour to undercut wages of British workers.

He also launched a fierce attack on Ukip, which has eaten into Labour’s core working-class vote in some areas, suggesting the party was prejudiced against working women, foreigners and gays and lesbians.

Mr Miliband pledged to tackle a ‘zero-zero economy’, saying many ordinary workers were on so-called zero-hours contracts while the rich ‘get away with zero tax’.

Mr Miliband suggested establishment enemies were ranged against him, while the Tories 'think that Britain does best when the most powerful do best'

Mr Miliband insisted he has the resilience to win the election, as he took aim at vested interests he blames for opposing his plan for change

Senior Labour figures insisted last night that ‘Hell would freeze over’ before they joined forces with Nigel Farage after the election.

On Wednesday, the Ukip leader said he would be prepared to prop up a Labour government if Ed Miliband failed to win a majority and Ukip secured about ten seats.

Mr Farage said he would ‘do a deal with the Devil’ if it ‘got me what I wanted’ – apparently a reference to his demand for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union

Last night a senior Labour figure dismissed the idea, saying ‘Hell would freeze over’ before Labour did a deal with Ukip.

‘The Tories have no answers to the discontent people feel,’ he said. ‘Ukip have wildly wrong answers to that discontent. And who knows what one can say about the Liberal Democrats?’

Quoting a phrase used by Tony Blair in his farewell conference speech in 2006, he insisted: ‘Friends, I say we can take this lot apart – and it is time we did.’

Mr Miliband added: ‘No vested interest, whoever they are and however powerful they are, from banks to energy companies, should ever be able to hold our country back.’

Aides suggest a shadowy network of City institutions, energy companies, media magnates, payday lenders and hedge funds is determined to stop him winning power.

They insisted Mr Miliband did not blame them for his recent difficulties, but he was determined to confront powerful establishment figures.

Ed Miliband's net satisfaction ratings have slumped 10 points to -44, the worst for any main party leader six months before a general election, according to IpsosMORI data dating back to the 1970s

The Conservatives have pulled into a three-point lead, their biggest margin over Labour since 2010

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, touted as a potential leader, said Mr Miliband was prepared to ‘stand up for ordinary people against vested interests’.

‘That is what has defined his leadership of the Labour Party, against energy companies... against the banks, and yes, against parts of the media,’ he said. ‘And for those reasons there are people out there who don’t want him to win.’

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed Miliband and those in his bunker may have convinced themselves his difficulties are all the result of some sort of conspiracy. But the truth is, it’s the voters he has the real problem with.’

A Tory source added: ‘I’m surprised Ed Miliband wasn’t wearing a tin-foil hat today. His conspiracy theories are out of control.’

Mr Farage last night responded to Mr Miliband’s attacks by challenging him to a live TV debate, telling the Labour leader: ‘Come and have a go.’ 

THOSE 'VESTED INTERESTS' 

CLAIM: No vested interest, whoever they are and however powerful they are... should ever be able to hold our country back. 

Between now and the election they are going to use every tactic to try to destabilise, distract us and throw us off course. '

REALITY: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham says these ‘vested interests’ include the Right-wing media – accused by Labour of concocting stories of a leadership crisis. 

In fact, the turmoil was triggered by a savage attack on Mr Miliband by the Left-wing New Statesman magazine, which labelled him an ‘old-style Hampstead socialist’; and the Left-leaning BBC, which reported that Labour backbench MPs had called for him to quit.

It was fuelled by The Observer, which claimed 20 Shadow Cabinet members were on the brink of calling for Mr Miliband to step down. 

IS LABOUR DISUNITED?

CLAIM: We haven’t had the best couple of weeks. Disunited parties are parties that the public worries about and I understand that. 

REALITY: So which is it – is the Labour Party disunited, as he appears to concede, or is it all a great conspiracy by the media and the shadowy ‘vested interests’? 

His remarks are certainly a sharp U-turn on last week, when he claimed there was no discontent in the Labour ranks. 

Last Thursday, he told the BBC: ‘I don’t accept that this matter [concern over his leadership] arises. Honestly, this is nonsense.’ 

THE 'ZERO-ZERO ECONOMY'

CLAIM: People are asking why they are on zero-hours contracts while some of those at the top get away with paying zero tax. The zero-zero economy, we need to change. 

REALITY: Not only is the zero-zero economy an ugly, wonkish soundbite – it’s disingenuous. 

There is no legal way for a high-earning individual in Britain to pay no tax unless they have donated all their earnings to charity. 

The people in Britain who pay no income tax are people whose salary is less than £10,000 (many of whom will be on zero-hours contracts). 

It took the Tory/Lib Dem Coalition to raise the threshold for the personal tax allowances

IMMIGRATION U-TURN

CLAIM: It isn’t prejudiced to worry about the effects of immigration. It is because of the real impacts it has.

REALITY: Only last month, Labour led criticism of Tory Defence Secretary Michael Fallon when he warned communities feel ‘swamped’ by mass immigration – despite it being a view shared by Labour’s own ex-home secretary, David Blunkett. 

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander accused Mr Fallon of not being ‘responsible’. 

Labour continues to resist any changes to EU free movement.
