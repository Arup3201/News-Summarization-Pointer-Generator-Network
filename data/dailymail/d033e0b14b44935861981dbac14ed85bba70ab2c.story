Traditionally Apple launches are like Marmite - the fanboys love them while everyone else slams the  firm for over-hyped devices, yet yesterday's event was met initially by something that could be considered worse: indifference. 

Immediately after the event, many described the announcement on Twitter as underwhelming and since the unveiling opinion on social networks remains mixed but predominantly muted.

Surprisingly though, one of the most influential people to criticise the devices has been Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak who, during the Apps World conference in London, said the iPads didn't meet his needs.

With Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak slamming the new iPad Air, left, and iPad mini, right, for concentrating on style over substance, other experts are torn as to whether customer expectation is really the problem

Wozniak, pictured, told the BBC he 'wishes to God' Apple and Google will be partners in the future

Wozniak said: 'Yes it's thinner but I wanted storage' adding he was tempted, but in the end emailed his wife saying he wouldn't be getting one.

He has been outspoken in the past when it comes to Apple and recently said the film biopic of Job’s life was ‘fiction’.

He also accused Ashton Kutcher, who played Jobs, of being ‘disingenuous’ and claimed a key scene was ‘totally wrong’.

Apple chose to stick with an almost identical design for its new iPad mini, aside from adding the faster A7 chip first seen on the iPhone 5S and a Retina display, which in fact makes the device thicker and heavier.

The same A7 chip has been added to the fifth-generation iPad, now known as iPad Air, and the 9.7-inch model has been made thinner and lighter but lacks many more original features.

Tim Ryan, a partner at Davenport Lyons told MailOnline the lack of fanfare around Apple's event may be more about customer expectation than about Apple's ability to innovate: 'The 
fact is consumers are more and more sophisticated and their 
expectation levels regarding new products and product launches have 
risen stratospherically over the last five years or so. 

'It does take 
something pretty special nowadays, from whichever manufacturer is 
concerned, to generate a buzz in the market.'

How customers are evolving and responding to new technology is also a point raised by Matthew Knight, head of innovation at media agency Carat.

Apple claims the tablet market is now split between high-end products and budget devices, yet Knight believes 'the audience is not splitting, but rather spreading 
across the whole price spectrum.'

Because the majority of the market sits below Apple's price points, Knight continues Apple needs to 'do a great deal of work' to excite the mid-market and persuade them to switch up to Apple products.

Commenting on the new devices, including the iPad Air, pictured, mobile agency Fetch said: 'Long gone are the days where Apple would capture the audiences' imaginations. Apple is continuing to ride the wave of success that Steve Jobs established'

Apple was heavily criticised for not releasing the budget iPhone many had expected with the iPhone 5C last month, and some claimed Apple would ultimately suffer if it failed to attract emerging markets, yet Wired.co.uk editor Nate Lanxon believes Apple may see things a little differently: 'Apple's cheaper tablet continues to 
be its older models, not new models created at cheaper price points.

'The
 iPad 2, for example, remains on sale even though it's now years old; 
the non-Retina Display iPad mini also will be sold still, and it is 
these models Apple will use to encourage more price-conscious shoppers.'

Ben Wood, director of devices at CCS Insight agreed: 'By
 continuing to manufacture [older models]
 Apple is extending its product portfolio's reach. This is critical 
given increasing competition, particularly from players such as Amazon and Google.'

Yet Robert Sharl, lecturer in Visual Communication at Birmingham City University doesn't think Apple should be concerned because it 'doesn’t
 see the iPad as a commodity tablet, competing for Christmas 
stocking-filler sales with the likes of Tesco’s Hudl and Amazon’s Kindle
 Fire'. Instead it’s building out the range. 'It’s a smart strategy, 
because it lets Apple build devices that create real value.'

Despite this, the Apple launch did ruffle a few people's feathers. Moin Maniar, chief technology officer
 at mobile agency Fetch slammed the launch as an 'over publicised and under 
delivering performance' from the California-based firm.

'Long gone are the days when Apple 
would capture the audiences' imaginations and turn them into reality on 
stage with groundbreaking products.

'Apple is continuing to ride the wave of success that Steve Jobs established.

Alongside the new products, Apple vice president Eddy Cue, pictured, also announced the firm was making a number of its software programs available for free, including the Mac operating system, iWork and iLife. Experts claim this is a direct swipe at competitors including Microsoft

Apple is rumoured to be working on a range of high-definition TVs with 55- and 65-inch screens. 

The claims were made by Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Advanced Research in Japan.

Although he didn't identify his source, he told the Wall Street Journal the models are expected to have a 'frameless design.'

Apple
 could release the giant television by the end of 2014 and Ishino would 
expect them to sell for around $1,500 and $2,500 respectively.

'Now all we are left with are newly 
named existing products.

'No wonder Apple is now giving away, what they 
refer to as a ‘new’ operating system, for free. Any paying user would be
 furious with the lack of improvements.'

Alongside the new products, Apple also announced it was making a number of its software programs available for free, including the Mac operating system plus iWork, the Mac equivalent to Microsoft's Office software.

Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline Apple's move into free software is directly aimed 'at wresting Microsoft's control of the market.'

'Tim
 Cook's potshots at Office and Windows underpinned this as a clear 
attempt to disrupt the Microsoft model of historically charging
 for OS upgrades and attempting to charge subscription fees for software.

'Making
 iWorks, iLife and Mavericks free will ensure they're the Apple of tech 
fans' eyes, while pipping Microsoft to the post in bringing productivity
 software to iPad owners closes the door on a huge opportunity for its 
rival.'
