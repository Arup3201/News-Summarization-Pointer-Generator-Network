A second-time mother gave birth to her daughter while sitting on the toilet, hearing a splash before discovering her newborn in the water.

Tracey Fryer, from Rotherham in Yorkshire, felt no pain, contractions or any signs of labour when she delivered tiny Peyton two weeks before her due date.

The 26-year-old mistakenly thought she needed to go to the loo, before retrieving her daughter from the toilet bowl.

'I was in complete shock, I heard a big splash so I looked down in between my legs and could see my baby,' said Mrs Fryer.

Tracey Pryer was shocked when she gave birth to her daughter Peyton while on the toilet at her Rotherham home. She shouted for husband Karl, who rushed to clear the newborn's airways

'My mum shouted up and asked if I was okay - but all I could reply with was, "no I’ve had her".

'My husband, Karl, came running straight in and was acted so quickly - he was like a real life super daddy.

'I don’t know what I would’ve done without him.

'He
 grabbed Peyton out of the toilet - I was panicking as she wasn’t crying
 but Karl cleared her airways and she let out a huge scream, it was such
 a relief.'

Baby Peyton was due on Saturday, but because Mrs Fryer is a diabetic she was booked in to be induced on May 19.

But two days before she was due to go to hospital, Mrs Fryer unexpectedly gave birth at home.

She said: 'I couldn’t wait to give birth to my baby, I knew she was a girl since finding out her sex when we went for our 20-week scan.

'On May 17, I woke up and it was like any other day - I was in no pain whatsoever.

'But when I went to the toilet, I sat down and gave one little push and I felt something come flying straight out of me.

Mrs Pryer, 26, said she heard a splash and looked down to see Peyton in the water

'Luckily I live with my mum and she phoned 999 while Karl was seeing to me and Payton.

'The paramedics came and we were whisked off to the hospital and stayed in overnight so we could be monitored.

'Fortunately we were both fine - Peyton was a healthy baby girl weighing 6lbs 11oz.

'I was in complete shock for a while and prayed for Peyton to be healthy - now I can see the funny side though but I just can’t believe my baby was born in the loo.'

The full time mum and carer married her childhood sweetheart Karl, 25, - who suffers from epilepsy - back in 2008.

The couple already have 14-month-old baby girl Midina and couldn’t wait for the extra addition to arrive to complete their family.

Mrs Fryer, said: 'When I gave birth to Midina the whole ordeal was completely different - I was in labour for over nine hours and was in so much pain.

'That’s why Peyton was such a shock - I was expecting to go through a similar experience but instead she couldn’t wait and slipped straight out within seconds.

'She’s our little miracle toilet baby - the doctors were amazed and found it hilarious.

'Our baby girl is one week old and despite her unexpected arrival in the toilet she never stops smiling.'
