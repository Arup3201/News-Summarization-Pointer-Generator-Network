The September glossies are the most important magazines of the year for the fashion industry

I have just spent the last two days immersed in the September issues of our Great British glossies.

The September issue, as fans of the documentary of the same name might recall, is the most important of the year.

Its job is to plug the new autumn/winter collections, and thus garner valuable advertising spend.

So, you expect the most surprising covers, the funniest writing, the most insightful edits of the many, many clothes out there, and great new ideas we can all try.So, am I now poised, credit card in hand, to purchase my new winter wardrobe? Do I have a wealth of beauty tips at my disposal? Plus relationship advice, ideas on what to read and see? Um, not exactly…Today, I am reviewing Vogue, InStyle and ELLE.

Tomorrow, I will tackle Marie Claire, Grazia, and online magazine The Edit, brought to us by Net A Porter. Vogue, £3.99

Cover star: Canadian supermodel Daria Werbowy, wearing a frankly old-hat orange biker jacket by Balenciaga, over a tartan sweater by Stella McCartney. It’s a fresh-faced, casual photo, but I’d have liked something more polished and ladylike.The fashion: Vogue has shot my favourite look of the new season – Louis Vuitton’s black negligee dress, £1525 – on model Cara Delevingne. She appears over 26 pages, a mix of editorial and ads.

The shoots are stupendous, but why has Vogue ditched More Dash than Cash in its entirety?Features: Interviews with Tom Ford and Pharrell Williams (the latter makes me wonder: why?). An investigation into the fur trade has a staggering statistic: 69 per cent of designers used fur in their autumn/winter collections.

This is Christopher Kane, frequently lauded as the Next Big Thing: ‘Fur gives an added depth of luxury.’ Deputy editor Emily Sheffield is won over: mink live in ‘straw-filled cages’,  and ‘don’t show distress’.

She watches the mink killed, aged six months: ‘They are taken from their huts and gassed. In 20 seconds they are asleep, gone.’ Foxes are electrocuted, ‘It’s instantaneous, I promise you’.

Emily points out farmers ‘rely [on the astrakhan trade, where lamb foetuses are aborted for their pelt] on the trade… are we right to remove that income?'Celebrity muttering: Tom Ford says, ‘I weigh myself every day… I have three baths a day.’ And he has a new baby. How on earth does he fit it all in?

Most useless piece of advice: Let a strap fall off one shoulder 

Kate Bosworth on the cover of this month's InStyle

InStyle, £3.90Cover star: Kate Bosworth. I mean, who cares, really? In Marc Jacobs shorts.The fashion: Page after page of REAL FUR. Lots of catwalk pictures, which to me spells laziness.Features: The most sycophantic backstage report from Louis Vuitton, viz: ‘An unprecedented invitation to the pre-show VIP green room is offered. Talk about final fashion frontiers. I am giddy with anticipation. A couple of models have been up since 2am. Beautiful fabrics, beautiful furs…’Celebrity muttering: At Cannes, Doutzen Kroes reveals, ‘I was so tired I kept falling asleep at the film premiere; there was a lot of shouting which woke me up.’Most useless piece of advice: Create a mood board to help show your hair colourist the exact shade you are after… 

Elle wins the battle of the glossies

ELLE, £4Cover star: Katy Perry in tweed Dolce & Gabbana shorts, which have the effect of truncating her legs alarmingly.The fashion: The best of all the magazines, with the most pages. I love the way they do day and night looks with one key garment, and the respect paid to High Street versions of all the key looks.

I really can’t fault the coverage, plus there is much less ‘advice’ from the dreaded interns, which I felt devalued ELLE’s stance as being in the know.Features: I’m not wild about new columnist Victoria Coren so far, and while the feature on what successful women were up to aged 25 was a good idea, it didn’t quite come off. But at least this magazine tries to be original.Celebrity muttering: Katy Perry doesn’t know what Byronic means. It is explained to her. ‘I’m going to remember that word’.Most useless piece of advice: The feature headline ‘Is your lunch break ageing you?’ is a bit daft. Another page tells readers… how to wash their hair!
