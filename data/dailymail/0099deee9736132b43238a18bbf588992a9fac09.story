A Pennsylvania mother has been arrested after allegedly setting fire to a police detective's house as retaliation for her son's arrest.

Prosecutors say 52-year-old Donna M. Krupp, of Montgomery County, was caught on camera using a grill lighter to set fire to the Christmas decorations at the detective's house on Thursday. She lived down the street from the cop.

No one was injured as the victim, Detective Ernie Morris, was at Disney World with his wife and children at the time.

But the family  cat was killed and the house destroyed with nearly everything in it.

One of the detective's daughters, an artist, lost most of her portfolio while her musician sister lost her violin, WFMZ reported.

Krupp was arrested that same day and charged with arson and reckless endangerment, among other charges.

Officials say she had been resentful toward the detective since June, when her son Joshua Beauseigneur was arrested on an outstanding traffic violation for evading police.

Detective Morris wasn't involved in the arrest of Joshua Beauseigneur — but Krupp remained convinced her neighbor cop had told officers where to find her son.

'When her son was arrested, she couldn't accept that and that's when she started the other harassment,' neighbor Terri Pope, a friend of Morris', told NBC10 Philadelphia.

Police say they warned Krupp to stay away from Morris — but she continued to confront the officer whenever she ran into him. 

She is being held on $1 million bail. 

Luckily, Detective Morris (pictured) and his family were at Disney World during the fire and were not injured
