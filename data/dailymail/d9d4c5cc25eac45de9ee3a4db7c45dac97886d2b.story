Emergency legislation will today be announced at Westminster to allow Britain’s spies to access data about the public’s phone calls, texts and internet use.

The laws will be rushed through Parliament amid mounting concern about the threat posed to the UK by jihadists returning from fighting in Syria.

Ministers and security officials have also voiced public fears about the damage caused by Edward Snowden – the fugitive US official who stole and leaked top secret documents on GCHQ intelligence gathering to the Guardian newspaper.

The laws are intended to protect the 'capability' which the likes of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 are on the brink of losing

The law will force mobile phone and internet companies to store information relating to all recent telephone calls, emails and internet searches, so they can be accessed by security officials.

There are long-standing Coalition tensions over the issue of communications data. But officials insist the legislation is not intended to give the security services and police any new powers.

Rather, it is intended to protect the ‘capability’ which the likes of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 are on the brink of losing. 

Under an EU directive passed in the wake of the July 7 attacks, telephone and internet companies have been obliged to store details such as who a person calls, where from and for how long for a period of 18 months.  

It has proved crucial in smashing a series of terrorist plots, as well as organised crime syndicates and paedophile groups.  

But the directive was ruled unlawful by the European Court of Justice in April this year – with ministers given a strict deadline to re-write UK law or stop using the spy powers.

After weeks of negotiations between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, agreement has now been reached to re-instate the powers.

This will be done by writing them directly into British law rather than relying on the now unlawful 2006 EU data retention directive.

Tory ministers remain adamant that further powers are needed to reflect changes in technology since 2006 - but accept this will now have to wait until after the 2015 General Election.

The Liberal Democrats remain implacably opposed to the so-called ‘snoopers’ charter’ – which would have given police and spy agencies even greater powers to monitor every telephone call, email and internet search in Britain.

In a speech last month, Mrs May said the security services need new surveillance powers to counter the ‘real and deadly’ threat from jihadists.

She said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had created a haven for terrorists just a few hours from London by plane.

At the same time, the internet has become a ‘paradise’ for terrorists and criminals who can operate out of the reach of the authorities.

But Mrs May added that the powers used to defeat Britain’s enemies were not keeping up with new technology, leading to a collapse in Britain’s capacity to protect its citizens.  

Later this year, a report by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee into the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, southeast London, is expected to argue that - had MI5 had greater internet surveillance powers - it could have helped to thwart the plot.
