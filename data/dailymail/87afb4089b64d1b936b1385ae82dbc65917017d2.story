The Kardashian family should count themselves lucky that Kris Jenner can always be counted on to have their backs especially when it comes to defending her celebrity family.

The world's most infamous momager appeared on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday morning to slam a number of rumours about her reality show daughters and her ex-husband.

At first, it sounded like the 58-year-old may have been pulling a Khloe Ã  la Sunrise, when presenter Kyle Sandilands asked her about Bruce Jenner's rumoured sex change the line cut out.

However, ever the professional, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians matriarch was back on the phone a short time later ready to defend her ex-husband.

'That's a story they've been writing since the Seventies, and I think they just keep regurgitating stuff... and the more sensational the headline they are going to sell magazines,' Kris said.

'It's just like unbelievable that these blatant lies are printed and people are gullible and they buy the magazines,' she added, clearly irate.

She then managed to change the topic saying, 'We just all got back from vacation and had a great time and the family is great and we are looking forward to Kim getting married and the babies are doing well.'

Putting to bed those Playboy rumours, Kris laughed off reports that she would ever pose nude for the magazine.

'Oh my God, no!' she said. 'I don't think anyone wants to see me without any clothes on.'

'The older you get, the harder it is. I love to work out and love to feel feel like I'm in shape... Last summer I posted those bikini photos because I thought it was so inspirational for someone in their fifties to have some motivation and say 'wow' anybody can put a bathing-suit on.'

The black-haired beauty also dispelled whispers that daughter Kim's wedding to rapper Kanye West in Paris in the coming months could be cancelled because of a rule that says a couple must live in France for 40 days before they can tie the knot.

'As far as Kim and Kanye go, everything is on track and they actually have a place there, they have a house in Paris.'

Kim's wedding number three seems to be all go, however, Kris has yet to see her second eldest daughter's wedding dress and admitted that she doesn't know what the wedding plans are.

She said that Kim wants to do things very differently 'from last time round', with something a little more simple and in keeping with Parisian tradition.

Speaking about what is set to be one of the biggest Vogue covers ever, Kris said it was so 'top-secret' that not even the rest of the family knew about it.

'It was so exciting' to go through it all with Kim and 'watch one of her dreams unfold', Jenner said.

Going from the pending nuptials of one daughter to the marriage break-up of another, Kris admitted, 'Khloe and Lamar are still apart... there is not really any change there that I know of or that I can report. She is just hanging in there and doing her best.'

The news will surely add fire to speculation that the newly single 29-year-old is dating rapper French Montana.

The quick-firing radio presenters also asked about Khloe's Sunrise saga and whether she cut the line after they asked her about her 10-month-old neice North West or if it was an accidental dropout.

Kris laughed that she didn't even hear about the uproar, saying she was probably asleep back in LA.

To help get her mind of her crumbled marriage, Khloe plans to move to the Hamptons in Long Island with Kourtney in the next two months to film a new spin-off - Khloe and Kourtney take the Hamptons.

It'll give Kourtney's partner Scott Disick a chance to show their children Mason, four, and 20-month-old Penelope the place in which he grew up following the deaths of both his parents in the last six months.
