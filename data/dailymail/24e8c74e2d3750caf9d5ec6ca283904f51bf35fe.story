Charity aid convoys are at the centre of a counter terrorism investigation over fears they are supporting Al-Qaeda militants in Syria.

Tens of thousands of pounds in cash has already been seized from relief vehicles travelling from Britain to the war-torn state.

Security services fear the huge relief effort is being hijacked by radical Islamists determined to support networks of violent jihadists.

British suicide bomber Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, is among those who have travelled to Syria  under the banner of charitable work. He joined an aid convoy after his Crawley mosque raised more than £140,000 to help refugees

Yesterday Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he remains deeply concerned at the threat posed by returning British jihadists.

‘We have not changed the policy,’ he said. ‘We are concerned about the number of British people going to Syria for humanitarian reasons or to get involved in the war that is happening.

‘There are a few hundred people going out there. They may be injured or killed, but our biggest worry is when they return they are radicalised, they may be militarised, they may have a network of people that train them to use weapons.’ 

British Home Counties suicide bomber Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, was among those who travelled to Syria under the banner of charitable work.

He joined an aid convoy after his Crawley mosque raised more than £140,000 to help refugees in just a few months.

Volunteers travelled the 2,000 mile journey in a fleet of old ambulances loaded with supplies, including food, bedding and medical equipment.

But Majeed left them to kill himself by driving an armoured dumper lorry laden with explosives into the gates of Aleppo prison last week.

The vehicle was draped in the flags of Jabhat al-Nusra, an extremist faction aligned to al-Qaeda and banned in Britain.

Further details of how the father-of-three was radicalised emerged yesterday as hate preacher Omar Bakri revealed he was a close aide.

The cleric, barred from Britain almost nine years ago, said Majeed was a key member of his banned organisation Al-Muhajiroun.

Bakri said he worked as his driver between his North London home and Crawley, where he nurtured a power base of militant supporters.

Speaking from his home in Beirut, Bakri described Majeed as ‘a very dear brother’ and valued member of Al-Muhajiroun between 1996 and 2004.

‘He was a student of Sharia law,’ he said. ‘He wanted to study Islam and was very interested in how we could establish an Islamic state.

‘But I had not seen or heard of him for about a decade, until it was reported he had died. I am not surprised he became a jihadist, but I did not expect him to go as far afield as Syria.

‘He gave his life for the Muslim brotherhood and Muslims should be very proud of him. He was a good Muslim and he is now in paradise.’

Police also raided the home of the brother of one of Britain’s most notorious terrorists after it was revealed he travelled to Syria with Majeed.

Forensic experts were combing the Crawley home of Raheed Mahmood, brother of Waheed Mahmood, jailed for life in 2007 over the fertiliser bomb plot.

Neighbours said the two men ‘were like brothers’ and Mahmood falsely claimed to have travelled to Pakistan to arrange a marriage after his six month trip to Syria.

Majeed is also believed to have also been close friends with convicted terrorists Jawad Akhbar and Omar Khyam, who led the fertiliser plot.

Khyam was an associate of 7/7 ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan, who travelled to Crawley several times in 2004.

Police and officials at the charity watchdog are closely monitoring a handful of Islamic groups collecting money for the Syrian relief effort.

One charity under the spotlight is Al-Fatitha Global, which was given £140,000 by Langley Green Mosque, in Crawley.

It is being monitored by the Charity Commission over its activities in Syria, and a spokesman said its ‘governance and financial management’ remain under scrutiny.

Officials are also concerned that some groups are handling hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations despite not being officially registered as charities.

An investigation by Kent Police is still on-going after £36,000, $10,600 and 1,400 Euros were seized from one convoy at the port of Dover in December 2012.

Members of a similar convoy were discovered to have named their vehicles after Aafia Siddiqui, a woman dubbed ‘Lady Al Qaeda’.

The Pakistani neuroscientist is serving an 86 year prison sentence for attempting to murder U.S. officials after being caught with bomb making instructions in Afghanistan.

Majeed left for Syria six months ago after mosques and churches in Crawley joined forces for a huge fundraising effort.

He was a prominent member of Langley Green Mosque which he attended with his wife and three children, aged 18, 16 and 12.

The Department for International Development confirmed that mosque leaders attended an event last week aimed at discouraging people from travelling to Syria.

Senior members of mosques across Sussex were invited to a hotel for a presentation by the Government department, the Foreign Office and police on their work in the Middle East.

Speaking last night, mosque chairman Arif Syed insisted Majeed’s family have not ‘given up hope’ as there has been no official confirmation of his death.

He added: ‘We still haven’t heard anything and we’re fearing for the worst. The family are very tense and distressed.’

Last October, William Shawcross, Charity Commission chairman, said it is almost inevitable that some charity money will end up in the hands of terrorists.
