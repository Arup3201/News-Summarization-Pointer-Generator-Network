CNN’s new chief wants Erin Burnett to front a revised morning show in his first major shake-up of the TV network, according to reports.

Jeff Zucker supposedly thinks that Burnett is a ‘real talent,' despite her failure to gain much traction in prime time with her 7 pm show, and that she could be the one to end the ratings slump that has seen its breakfast program beaten even by HLN.

The plan would be to try and recreate some of the magic which Zucker did at NBC in the 1990s when he started Today on its 16-year run as the number one morning show.

Bad times: In April CNN posted its worst month since 2001 with an average of just 357,000 viewers, a drop of 21 per cent on the previous year

Should Zucker make such a move it could be a slap in the face to Soledad O’Brien, who only in January was made anchor of CNN’s ‘Starting Point’, which runs from 7am to 9am.

According to reports, when Zucker was revealed as the new network boss, O’Brien said: ‘He’s an incredible news executive....I’m thrilled.’

The New York Post claimed that the new plan would be to move Burnett from her 7pm to 8pm slot to the new morning show.

The 7pm show, which started in October 2011, has not made a mark in the ratings. CNN's primetime lineup has been plagued by problems in recent years.

In 2010 Campbell Brown left her program due to poor ratings. Her replacements Rick Sanchez and Parker & Spitzer both failed, and Anderson Cooper was been give a second hour.

Burnett getting shoved off primetime would further add to CNN's graveyard of primetime show, but a source insists ‘Zucker thinks she’s a real talent' who could help their mornings.

‘He’ll team her up with a guy, and they’ll go after the audience watching Today and Good Morning America.

‘One thing Zucker knows how to do is a morning show.’

Burnett, 36, a former financial analyst, got her big break on CNBC hosting business show Street Signs and Squawk on the Street before joining CNN in 2011.

Her Erin Burnett OutFront show regularly gets twice as many viewers as she did on CNBC, but CNN is more widely available than CNBC and does broader interest news.

Should Zucker appoint her to a morning show it would have a certain irony to it - she only joined CNN after NBC did not give her a job on the Today show, which instead went to Savannah Guthrie.

O’Brien also worked under Zucker when he was at NBC and founded Today.

CNN sources have told Mediabistro that her time at CNN has not been as charmed and that the network has done little to help her.

One insider said it had given ‘very little thought, resources, creativity or marketing’ into Starting Point.

O’Brien herself has said: ‘Morning TV is about habits. What you really need is for viewers to find you, get comfortable with you, make you part of their mornings.

‘If you can make news, deliver things they value, you can be successful.’

Burnett left NBC and its sister cable networks in 2011, when she was passed over for the Today show co-hosting gig in favor of Ann Curry. Ratings plummeted, Curry was dumped from the program this summer, and NBC replaced Curry with Savannah Guthrie, center left in purple. The Today show has fallen behind ABC since Guthrie joined

O’Brien, 46, has moved out of the morning slot before and it did not hinder her career at all.

When she was reportedly fired from CNN’s American Morning in 2007 she spent five years making award-winning documentaries instead.

Should Burnett be moved to the morning slot it would also present a potential nightmare for NBC - three women it spurned going up against it.

First would be Burnett on CNN, second is former Today presenter Amy Robach, who is now with ABC, and third is Norah O'Donnell from the CBS morning show.

The potential reshuffle comes after CNN has experienced some of its worst ratings ever.

In April the network posted its worst month since 2001 with an average of just 357,000 viewers, a drop of 21 per cent on the previous year.

The slump was even higher among the coveted 25-54 age bracket where 29 per cent fewer people tuned in.

Recent viewing figures from Nielsen also illustrate the scale of the problem CNN is facing with regards its morning show.

Last Thursday Starting Point got 301,000 viewers on average compared to 537,000 for MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’, which is a more even comparison than GMA or Today.

Fox & Friends drew in 1.1 million, more than any other cable TV network.
