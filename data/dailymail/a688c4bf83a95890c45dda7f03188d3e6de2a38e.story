Olympic gold medal skier Bode Miller has spoken about the pain of learning his younger brother was found dead from an apparent seizure in a van close to the mountains in California.

'He loved life so much; it made him easy to love and easy to be around,' Bode told The Ski Channel shortly after learning about Chelone Miller's passing.

'I’m going to miss him a lot.'

Chelone, who was an Olympics hopeful in snowboarding and had competed with the best from around the world, was unresponsive when emergency workers found him in Mammoth Lakes.

'Chelone Miller was an aspiring elite athlete who had made great progress as a snowboardcross rider this past season': The President of U.S. Snowboarding said of Miller

Miller had a history of seizures following a 2005 motorcycle crash that left him in a coma for 11 days.

He also lost his memory for one month after the accident near his hometown in New Hampshire.

Miller once suffered a seizure while on a chairlift and fell 25 feet onto his back.

He was well-known in his adopted home town of Mammoth Lakes, where he was admired for his bravery and dedication to the potentially dangerous sport of snowboardcross.

Miller, originally from Easton, N.H., was hoping to make the U.S. squad in snowboardcross for the 2014 Sochi Games.

Just last month, Chelone Miller won the Rahlves Banzai Tour overall title courtesy of a victory at Sugar Bowl in California.

The
event is organized by Daron Rahlves, a former World Cup and Olympic 
skier. The Twitter account @RahlvesBanzai tweeted: 'RIP Chilly..We will 
miss you, but never forget! Thoughts go out to @MillerBode and his 
family.'

Miller also recently finished fourth at the 2013 U.S. Snowboarding Grand Prix in Canyons, Utah.

In addition to competing, Miller also did some filming with Warren Miller and other production companies.

Bode Miller's wife, volleyball star Morgan Beck, Tweeted on Monday: 'Keep those you love close and remind them everyday how special they are. Life is so precious and fragile.'

U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association President Bill Marolt said in a statement on the team's website: 'Chelone Miller was an aspiring elite athlete who had made great progress as a snowboardcross rider this past season.

'We are all deeply saddened at the news of his death and extend our condolences to the entire Miller family.'

Miller 'was known just as much for his optimism and kind personality he was for his fearless presence on Mammoth Mountain's biggest park features,' the statement added.

Miller spent the weekend playing golf and snowboarding.

'Chilly always struck me as one to do things his way,' Nate Holland, a seven-time X Games gold medalist who competed against Miller in snowboardcross.

'He'd pop up here and there in his van as kind of a lone wolf, and throw down. He was a hard-charging snowboarder,' Holland told ESPN.

Holland is in Alaska, where he was expecting to see Miller for the Arctic Man. At last year's event, Holland said, Miller suffered a seizure on the day of the event and was airlifted to a hospital. After stabilizing, Miller returned to the course and raced.

'I remember the organizer saying, "If Chilly says he's racing, he's racing, and we're not going to finish this race until he gets back from the hospital,'" Holland recalled. 

The race is Friday. It's an event that combines 
snowmobilers with skiers and snowboarders who reach speeds in excess of 
80 mph.

'He was a very talented snowboarder and a great friend,' said 
John Teller, a Mammoth-based skicross racer who won X Games gold in 
2011.

Several Olympic athletes took to Twitter to express their condolences.

Freestyle skier and two-time Olympian Emily Cook wrote: 'Broken-hearted to hear of the passing of Chelone Miller. Sending love and prayers to Bode, friends and family.'

Snowboarder Elena Hight tweeted: 'My heart goes out to @MillerBode and his family. So sad for the loss of such a great person. #RIPchilly.'

Miller was one of four children. The family grew up on a farm without electricity or running water, but learned to ski and as soon as they could walk. He began snowboarding at the age of nine.

Bode Miller is a five-time Olympic medallist in alpine skiing. He sat out the 2012-13 World Cup season while recovering from a knee injury.

He won a gold medal in the 2010 games in Vancouver.

Last month he filed court documents in a bid to force Sara McKenna, his ex-lover and mother of his infant son, to move back to California so he can spend time with the boy.

He is also trying to have the boy's surname changed to Miller on his birth certificate.  Ms McKenna reportedly claimed that Mr Miller did not want her to have the child.

Meanwhile Mr Miller's wife, volleyball player Morgan Beck, whom he married late last year after beginning a romance soon after Ms McKenna became pregnant, but suffered a miscarriage last year after announcing her pregnancy.
