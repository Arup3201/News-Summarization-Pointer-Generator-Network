Yale has threatened to kick out a 20-year-old history major because she's too thin.

New Jersey native, Frances Chan, who is 5'2" and weighs 90lbs, claims she's been force feeding herself Cheetos and ice cream in an attempt to add flesh to her tiny frame after the Ivy League school became convinced she was suffering from an eating disorder.

Chan said the New Haven, Connecticut, college wouldn't even let up when her parents confirmed she, and the rest of her family, had always been naturally skinny and even sent in childhood medical records and had their doctor contact the school.

Harsh: Yale has threatened to kick out 20-year-old history major Frances Chan, pictured, because she's too thin

'It felt really bad to be this powerless,' Chan told the New Haven Register. 'I ate ice cream twice a day. I ate cookies. I used elevators instead of walking up stairs. But I don't really gain any weight.'

She said the battle over her weight began in September when she noticed a lump in her breast and went to get it checked out.

The lump came back benign, but Yale doctors called her in for a follow up appointment because they had other 'concerns.'

In the meeting, they told her she was dangerously underweight and imposed mandatory weekly weigh-ins as well as sessions with a mental health professional and a nutritionist.

Chan tried to comply with the school's request and put on weight but she only managed to gain two pounds.

However, the university said that wouldn't do.

One health professional even told her her low weight would kill her and they threatened to put her on a medical leave of absence.

Angry, helpless and distracted from her studies, Chan decided to pen an essay about her experience for the Huffington Post.

In it she explains that she's been small 'since high school, but it has never led to any illnesses related to low weight or malnutrition.'

'My mom was the same; my whole family is skinny. We all enjoy Mom's fabulous cooking, which included Taiwanese beef noodle soup, tricolor pasta, strawberry cheesecake, and cream puffs, none of which make the Weight Watchers shortlist. I just don't gain weight easily.'

She claims the university's blind use of Body Mass Index as a yard stick for a healthy weight is where they are going wrong.

'It
 subjects students who have a personal and family history of low weight 
to treatment that harms our mental health,' she writes in the article.

'By
 forcing standards upon us that we cannot meet, the University plays the
 same role as fashion magazines and swimsuit calendars that teach us 
about the "correct shape" of the human body.'

Finally, Chan decided to draw the line on the endless weigh-ins and mental health check ups, preferring to risk expulsion than send herself crazy trying to reach an unattainable goal.

'I'm done,' she writes.

'No more weigh-ins, no more blood draws. I don't have an eating disorder, and I will not let Yale Health cause me to develop one. If Yale wants to kick me out, let them try -- in the meantime, I'll be studying for midterms, doing my best to make up for lost time.'

The essay, in which Chan acknowledges the college thought it was doing the right thing, had the desired effect of drawing attention to the issue.

In addition, her parents came to New Haven to meet with health officials on campus, she switched to a new physician and she also wrote about her experience to Yale President Peter Salovey.

On Friday, she learned that her new doctor acknowledged BMI was not the only measure of a healthy weight and admitted the college had 'made a mistake' in how they handled her thin frame.

'So she trusts that I do not have an eating disorder,' Chan said, relived, of her physician.

In a statement to the Register, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said he couldn't talk of specific cases but insisted: 'Yale has a strong system of mental health care for students.'

He also said Yale has recently improved campus mental health services, and specifically included a student advisory committee on mental health and a series of 'listening sessions' with groups of students, presumably to avoid this happening again.
