Flamboyant businessman Geoffrey Edelsten has been 'reminded' of his financial duties towards ex-wife Brynne by debt collector and Melbourne identity Mick Gatto, as the couple's bitter split continues to play out in public.

The Age reported that Gatto visited Mr Edelsten at his Melbourne office, where the two spoke about what is allegedly owed to Brynne, from whom Mr Edelsten split in January.

The pair are in the middle of a lengthy legal battle over the allocation of Mr Edelsten's property holdings.

The dispute between the pair, who married in a $3 million ceremony in 2009, has soured amid claims that Mr Edelsten has flouted his financial obligations to Brynne and has continued to spend large sums of money on himself and his current partner Gabi Grecko.

Mr Edelsten is facing bankruptcy charges in both Australia and the United States, and has sought to have his ex-partners car repossessed.

Whilst Gatto refused to speculate on the settlement amount or the client who has requested his services, he said, 'Geoff was quite happy to assist but he's not really in a good financial position right now,'

'But he is aware he's got responsibilities that have to be taken care of.'
