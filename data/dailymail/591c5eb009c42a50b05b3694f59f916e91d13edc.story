England physio Gary Lewin was carried off on a stretcher with a dislocated ankle in bizarre circumstances after Daniel Sturridge's equaliser.

Lewin, a former member of Arsenal's physio staff, picked up the injury after standing on a water bottle while celebrating England's 37th-minute leveller - and was even carried off on the stretcher usually reserved for his players and will fly back to England.

Roy Hodgson's staff jumped off the bench in celebration but Lewin, who will be replaced by Steve Kemp for the remainder of the tournament, immediately fell to the floor and repeatedly banged the ground with his fist.

Concern: It was a mystery initially who had gone down after Sturridge's goal in the 2-1 loss to Italy

The 37th minute incident saw Lewin receiving medical treatment from both FIFA officials and players before he was ushered down the tunnel

'That was a very sad moment for us,' England boss Roy Hodgson said. 'In celebrating the goal he jumped up, landed on a water bottle and dislocated his ankle.

'It was very painful. He was taken to hospital. The doctor set it, put it back in at the side of the field, but it's the end of the World Cup for Gary.'

Lewin left the field on a stretcher after a short break in play, with the team's Twitter official feed, @england, swiftly confirming the severity of the injury.

'England physio Gary Lewin was injured during celebrations for @england's goal,' the post said. 'He has dislocated his ankle. Get well soon Gary #3Lions'

The Football Association later said the 50-year-old Londoner had suffered a fracture and dislocation.

An FA spokesperson added: 'We do have another physio with us - Steve Kemp.'

With little known about the protocol for injured medical staff, given the rarity of the situation, Lewin was quickly surrounded by a crowd of around a dozen staff from both sides and FIFA.

Lewin was first team physio at Arsenal for 22 years and became an England physio in 1996 alongside his job at the North London club.

But in 2008 he quit the Gunners to become Head of Physiotherapy for the national side.

In 2007, Lewin was credited with possibly saving John Terry's life in the League Cup Final after the Chelsea captain swallowed his tounge and Lewin, then Arsenal physio, was first off the bench to assist him.

During his time at Arsenal he was also credited with saving striker Eduardo's career after he suffered a horror leg break.

Hodgson’s staff haven’t had much luck with injuries recently – assistant manager Ray Lewington is on crutches after emergency knee surgery 24 hours before the team’s final friendly against Honduras.

England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed Lewin (pictured at the airport ready to fly home) had suffered a fractured and dislocated ankle. He said: 'It is the end of the World Cup for him I'm afraid'

On the mend: Lewin was put in a wheelchair after having his ankle tended to

Help: Lewin was first team physio at Arsenal for 22 years and became England's in 1996
