Bill Heffernan, who represents NSW in the federal senate, pulled out what appeared to be a pipe bomb at Parliament House to highlight loopholes in security screening measures, while addressing prominent Australian policemen.

The Liberal party senator produced the 'bomb' to showcase gaps in the new security arrangements at Canberra's Parliament House, which were introduced last week and allow MPs, senators, their families and staff, and public servants to enter the building without being screened by X-ray machines or metal detectors.

Under the new arrangements, which are designed to speed up entry and save money, the public, journalists based in the building, contractors and diplomats would still be screened.

Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan smuggled a pipe bomb into Parliament during a Senate Committee meeting to highlight flaws in the security arrangements at Parliament House in Canberra

Senator Heffernan was addressing Australian Police Commissioner Tony Negus and other Australian Federal Police officials during a senate Budget estimates hearing about the agency.

'This building is no longer secure,' he said.

'To demonstrate that, I brought in what could be… I brought this through security, a pipe bomb.'

'When I was a kid we used to blow stumps out on the farm, 50 years ago. We'd get some nitropril, a quart of distillate, a plug of jelly and a detonator, light the bloody thing and [it would] go to buggery. It could blow a tree the size of this building out of the ground.'

Under the new security arrangements MPs, senators and public servants will not be forced to pass through a metal detector or X-ray machine upon arrival at Parliament House

'This building is no longer secure': Senator Heffernan has been a supporter of increased security measures at Parliament House for many years

He produced the bomb, which was later confirmed to be a replica, while addressing Australian Police Commissioner Tony Negus and other Australian Federal Police officials

'At the present time there is nothing to stop anyone from bringing those ingredients in here over a period of time through security, would you agree?' Senator Heffernan asked.

Mr Negus responded: 'Senator under the current arrangements, that is a risk, yes.'

Senator Heffernan also added that there was the risk that someone working in a role that did not require them to be searched, might be forced or tricked into carrying dangerous materials into Parliament House by someone else.

Commissioner Negus later confirmed to the committee that the senator had showed him the 'bomb' before the committee hearing began and that Mr Negus was convinced it was just a piece of pipe.

Senator Heffernan brought a knife in NSW Parliament in 2009 to highlight security weaknesses. The knife was confiscated from him.

He also sparked controversy when he questioned Julia Gillard's ability to be Prime Minister on the grounds she was 'deliberately barren' and in 2002 the senator accused then High Court judge Michael Kirby of using Commonwealth cars to solicit under-age male prostitutes.

The controversial senator has been accused of making homophobic comments to staffers and to former High Court judge Michael Kirby

Bill Heffernan claimed that his pipe bomb could blow up a tree as tall as Parliament House

Parliament resumes sitting today after a break of more than a week. The government is anticipating considerable backlash in parliament as their controversial budget is debated.

Senator Heffernan's stunt sparked bemused reactions on social media.

'Bill Heffernan again breaks Tony Abbott's promise that this would be a government of "No Surprises",' quipped Victorian Labor MP Tim Watts.

'Parliament's back, estimates are on, Bill Heffernan uses a fake pipe bomb as a prop - I need a coffee,' wrote journalist Emma Griffiths.

Will Hughes highlighted the unequal treatment at the heart of the new security measures, tweeting: 'I'd dare anyone else to repeat this stunt, but it may be interpreted as incitement to commit a federal offence.'
