Ed Balls will vow today to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on building affordable homes and a stamp duty holiday if Labour is elected – after insisting the party has nothing to apologise for on the economy.

The Shadow Chancellor will tell his party’s annual conference in Manchester that he would use the proceeds of the forthcoming sale of the 4G mobile phone spectrum to fund the initiatives.

The defiant announcement is a deliberate contrast to the approach of Gordon Brown, who used all the £22.5billion raised from the sale of the 3G spectrum to pay down the deficit, even in the boom year of 2000.

sale of the 4G mobile spectrum to finance fiscal measures

Although Britain is now battling to avoid a full-scale debt crisis, Mr Balls will say he would use the £3billion expected to be raised from the latest sale to build 100,000 affordable homes and fund a two-year stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers of properties worth up to £250,000.

The Shadow Chancellor, asked yesterday whether he would apologise for Labour’s ‘profligacy’ when in power, declared: ‘No.’

Mr Balls said Labour had never pretended to be a ‘balanced budget party’, telling the Huffington Post website: ‘We were a borrow-to-invest and balance the current budget party.

‘David Cameron and George Osborne would like nothing better than for me to say that the reason there was a global financial crisis, the reason that our deficit went up, is because of Labour public spending. But it’s rubbish.’

Last minute revisions? Some Labour MPs hope that Mr Miliband would replace Mr Balls in the economic role should the party form a government after the next general election

Mr Balls insisted Britain’s structural 
deficit was only ‘marginally higher’ than other countries before the 
financial crisis hit, a claim derided by the Conservatives, who accuse 
Labour of ‘failing to fix the roof while the sun was shining’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband refused to 
guarantee that Mr Balls would be his Chancellor if Labour wins the 
election, though he appears powerless to move him.

Some
Labour MPs hope for a comeback by former chancellor Alistair Darling, 
or even Mr Miliband’s vanquished brother David, to take Mr Balls’s place
towards the next election.

Amid
persistent reports of tensions between him and Mr Balls, when the 
leader was asked if Mr Balls would definitely be chancellor if there was
a Labour government, he replied: ‘I think I’ll make my cabinet when it 
comes to . . . measuring the curtains is not my style.’

Mr
Balls, however, made it clear that he did not expect to be shifted to 
another shadow cabinet post. He said he would do everything he could to 
‘make it work’ if David Miliband decided he wanted to come back to the 
political  front line.

But asked if he would relinquish the shadow chancellorship, he replied: ‘There’s a limit even to my generosity.’

In his conference speech today, Mr Balls will say building 100,000 more affordable homes would help kick-start the economy and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.

‘We’re just one of two G20 countries in recession, the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. And because we are in recession, the deficit is now not going down, it’s going up – by 22 per cent so far this year,’ he will say.

‘There is nothing credible about a plan that leads to a double-dip recession, thousands of businesses bust, a million young people out of work, billions wasted on a soaring benefits bill, and borrowing going up not down.

'Rising borrowing, not to invest in the jobs of the future, but to pay for the mounting costs of this government’s economic failure.’

A Treasury source said the Government had not made any decision on what to do with the proceeds of the 4G sale.

‘Balls is all over the place – a feeble attempt to regain lost economic credibility with vague promises of a spending review after the election, then an unfunded stamp-duty cut, and now more spending,’ the source added. ‘It is total incoherence.’

Ed Miliband: He insisted he would undergo no Margaret Thatcher-style makeover to make him more attractive to voters before an election

Labour's attempts to overhaul Ed Miliband’s image by portraying him as a man of the people were undermined yesterday as he insisted he was proud to be seen as a 'pointy-headed’ policy wonk.

The party launched a TV film relentlessly highlighting Mr Miliband’s comprehensive school background in an apparent attempt to contrast his upbringing with that of Old Etonian David Cameron.

Old schoolfriends and teachers went before the cameras to suggest Mr Miliband’s ordinary education helped him to understand the lives of voters.

Polls suggest Mr Miliband’s personal ratings are well behind those of David Cameron, with voters struggling to see him as a credible  prime minister.

The main aim for this year’s Labour conference in Manchester appears to be to bring across his personality to voters and give more of a sense of what makes him tick.

Mr Miliband, however, flatly rejected suggestions that he should undergo a makeover like Margaret Thatcher, who was coached to lower her voice and had her hair restyled before winning in 1979.

'I’m certainly not going to be doing that,’ the Labour leader declared. Asked if he minded being seen as 'pointy-headed,’ Mr Miliband said: 'I think it’s rather a compliment.

'I’m my own person and I’m going to do it my own way. I think ideas matter in politics and I’m not embarrassed about that, right?’

Mr Miliband dismissed a poll commissioned by the Conservatives suggesting that two-thirds of Labour supporters think his brother David would be a better leader for the party.

'It’s quite a compliment the Tories produced a poll about me,’ he said. 'It shows I’ve got them worried.’

Pressed on whether his brother would return to Labour’s top team, Mr Miliband said: 'He made a decision not to join the shadow cabinet and that continues to be his view, that he wants to be in the front line but not on the front bench.’

According to an updated biography of  Mr
Miliband, towards the end of last year David was overheard saying: 'Ed 
will crash and burn.’

The former foreign secretary was in 
Manchester yesterday for the start of the conference, but will leave 
before his brother’s keynote speech tomorrow.

Asked yesterday if he had seen the 
poll suggesting he would be a more popular leader, David replied: 'Yes, 
but the most important thing to remember is that the grass always seems 
greener on the other side of the fence.

'I’m determined to do everything I can by supporting him (Ed) . . . sometimes that means speaking out, but it also means having the modesty sometimes to keep out of the way.’

Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, increasingly touted as a future leadership contender, admitted yesterday that Labour was not good enough at explaining its policies in ways that voters feel is relevant.

'We haven’t connected enough with people’s lives,’ he said. 'One of the problems sometimes is talking in jargon and percentages. You’ve got to relate what we say to people’s lives and make it relevant.’

Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman admitted many voters do not even know yet who Mr Miliband is.

She told the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme: 'We need to set forth our plans, because people want to know that Ed Miliband has a strong set of plans so that the politics of a government can make a difference to their life, and he’s very determined  he will do that.’
