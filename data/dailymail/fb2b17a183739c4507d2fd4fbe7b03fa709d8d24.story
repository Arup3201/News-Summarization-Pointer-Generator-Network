Murdered: Juliana Redding, 21, had just posed for Maxim magazine and was preparing for her acting career to skyrocket in 2008

It is a murder mystery straight out of Hollywood - a young actress and model strangled to death allegedly by the female enforcer of a shady businessman and physician who has fled the country.

This Monday, jury selection will begin in the long awaited murder trial of Kelly Soo Park, 47, who prosecutors in Southern California accuse of killing Juliana Redding, 21, with her bare hands in March 2008.

Prosecutors say that Park worked as a paid 'enforcer' for a Dr. Munir Uwaydah, who sent her to 'intimidate and threaten' the aspiring actress at her Santa Monica apartment after a business dispute involving her father.

Redding, originally from Tucson, Arizona, appeared in low-budget films and also modeled for Maxim magazine and was found beaten to death in her home over five years ago, according to Los Angeles County District Attorney Office records.

Initial reports at the time described a desperate struggle during which Redding had managed to dial 911 for help when her killer apparently grabbed the phone and hung up.

During the investigation, prosecutors discovered that Uwaydah had previously dated Redding and was also in the midst of planning to open a pharmaceutical business with her father, Greg Redding.

However, the plans for this fell apart five days before Juliana's death according to the Los Angeles Times because Redding doubted his business partners legitimacy.

Prosecutors allege that Uwaydah dispatched Park to Juliana and in turn her father into changing his mind about their planned venture.

While Uwaydah has since left the United States following Redding's death, he has not been charged in the murder.

Prosecutors allege though, that Park had worked as a 'debt collector' for the spinal surgeon and California businessman on at least two occasions.

'Hired muscle': Prosecutors say Dr Munir Uwaydah (left) had hired Kelly Soo Park (pictured right) to intimidate and harass his enemies -- and also sent her after Juliana

Kelly Soo Park, 47, is accused of killing an aspiring actress and model in 2008 on orders of a wealthy California doctor and businessman

The doctor referred to Park as being like 'James Bond,' according to court documents - Park currently remains free on $3.5 million bail

According to documents seen by the Los Angeles Times, Park was officially employed as Uwaydah's real estate broker, but was paid hundreds of thousands of extra dollars to collect debts for him.

The records show that Park received a $250,000 payment from Uwaydah just weeks before Redding was killed

For years, authorities have alleged that Julaiana, who was dated Dr Uwaydah, was murdered after Park was hired by the doctor to intimidate her

Uwaydah now lives in Lebanon and is not sought in connection with the murder of Redding.

A court motion filed last year says that prosecutors are 'not seeking to prove that [Park] murdered Ms. Redding at the direction of Dr. Uwaydah,' only that he told Park to intimidate and threaten the young actress.

Investigators in the case have said 
that Park has been linked to the crime by DNA evidence found on 
Redding's neck, however, defense attorney's argue that the real killer 
is Redding's boyfriend at the time of her death, John Gilmore.

Gilmore
was cleared as a suspect in the immediate aftermath of the murder, 
insisting that he had several people who could offer him an alibi according to CBS News.

'They're
trying to point the finger at Gilmore, saying he had, at one time, 
allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend,' ABC News legal analyst Dana Cole
said.

The defense alleges that Gimore's assault of his fiance√© Melissa Ayala casts doubt on the guilt of Park.

They
allege that Ayala told a defense attorney that Gilmore choked her 
saying, 'that he was going to make her feel what Juliana felt.'

Investigators in the case have said that Park has been linked to the crime by DNA evidence found on Redding's neck

However,
in a hearing last week Ayala refused to answer any questions, claiming
her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as she is facing 
an assault with a deadly weapon charge against Gilmore.
