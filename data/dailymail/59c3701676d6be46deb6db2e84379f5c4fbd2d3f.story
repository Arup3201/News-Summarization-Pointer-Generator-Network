They are some of Hollywood's biggest names - regularly jetting into the world's most glamorous locations.

But rather than Monaco or Malibu, these A-list celebrities decided to visit a small, isolated farm in Ireland after falling in love with its puppies.

Stars such as Jennifer Aniston, Owen Wilson and Calista Flockhart have all visited the farm in Connemara to visit its young sheepdogs.

The farm is owned and run by Joe Joyce, 47, who has previously helped with the hit film Marley and Me.

Following the film, he started holding sheepdog demonstrations at his farm. They proved such as success that he built the business into a major tourist attraction, with musicians, business tycoons and film stars all visiting.

Speaking to the Irish Independent, Mr Joyce said Owen Wilson was so impressed with the puppies that he wanted to take one back to his home in Malibu.

Mr Joyce said: 'He came around to our home and he was absolutely mad about the dogs, the sheep, the mountains.Â 

Cute: Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart also fell in love with the sheepdog puppies on the farm

Down to earth: Jennifer Aniston happily posed for pictures with members of Mr Joyce's family

'He told us he never got much of an opportunity to sit into a family home and have a chat with people'.

Former Friends star Jennifer Aniston was also bowled over by the farm and the puppies.

'She was so down to earth, said Mr Joyce. 'She just chatted away with everyone.'

Flockhart - the star of Ally McBeal - visited the farm with her parents and young son during a holiday in Ireland last year.

Through his work at the farm, Mr Joyce has transported dogs to countries all over the world, including Australia, Canada and Norway.
