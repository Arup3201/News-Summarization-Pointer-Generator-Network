A hairless cat had a lucky escape after being found with an arrow shot through her head.

Akila, a seven-year-old calico Sphynx, was found by her owner, Tyra Bulluck, 40, cowering in bushes in a neighbor's yard with a seven inch arrow that had been fired right between the terrified cat’s eyes.

Akila, a purebred calico Sphynx cat that lives strictly indoors, had a lucky escape when a seven inch arrow deflected off her skull lodging itself in skin and only causing a superficial wound

The projectile had deflected off Akila's skull, only going under the surface of the skin. Had it hit from a different angle and pierced the skull, it would have meant instant death.

Akila, a strictly indoor cat, had got out of the family’s home in Riverside, Florida, 12 miles south of Tampa, on Tuesday, and it was not until Wednesday morning that her owners made the disturbing discovery.

Akila underwent a 45-minute operation to remove the arrow and was able to go home with owner Tyra Bulluck (right) the same day. Bulluck has since contacted the local Sheriff's office about the attack

Until then their primary concern had been that the purebred had been outside on what had been a chilly night for Florida.

Akila was rushed to the Animal Coalition of Tampa where she underwent emergency surgery performed by veterinarian Elaine Foley to remove the arrow.

The 45-minute operation was successful and Akila was allowed to go home.

‘She's a very, very lucky girl,’ said Bulluck.

It is still unknown who shot the arrow into Akila's head, and Bulluck contacted the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office about the attack.

Police are  testing the arrow for fingerprints and other clues as part of an animal cruelty investigation

An animal cruelty investigation has been opened and the arrow is being checked for fingerprints and other clues. It is unknown whether it was fired from a crossbow or dart gun.

If a suspect is identified they will face animal cruelty charges.

This is only the second time that Akila has ever got out of the house.
