A spurned receptionist knocked an Indian doctor unconscious because he 'lied when he promised to marry her'.

Vasundhara Sharma, 27, slapped and punched the doctor repeatedly in his surgery, ripping off his clothes and leaving him apparently unconscious - before she was eventually dragged off by security. 

And even his own employees did not save him from a 30-minute ordeal, where she slapped him more than 70 times, because they believed it to be a private matter.

They eventually called police to the clinic in Indore, in Madhya Pradesh, India.

The incident occurred at the end of October - but the doctor, named as Dr Arpit Chopra, reported it two weeks later. 

He insisted the delay had been as a result of his injuries and not because he was trying to avoid a scandal. 

A preliminary investigation the woman had worked for Dr Chopra, who specialised in homoeopathic medicine.

She alleged that she had started a relationship with him after working at the clinic for three months in 2012.

The receptionist alleges she began a relationship with Dr Chopra and he reneged on a promise to marry her 

And her father has said she should be acquitted because the doctor had lied to his daughter and reneged on a promise to marry her.

In India, it is, in some cases, regarded as a criminal offence to promise to marry a woman in order to start a relationship and then to break it. 

Because the woman's consent to a sexual relationship was based on the promise of marriage, if the promise was a lie it means consent was never really given.

Therefore it has, in the past, sometimes been classified as rape.

But Dr Chopra claims the woman was delusional and although he had employed her for three months, he dismissed her when she tried to form a relationship with him.

A police spokesman said: 'A woman has lodged a sexual harassment case against a doctor and he in turn has lodged an assault case. 

'We will investigate the matter thoroughly and take appropriate action whosoever is found guilty.' 

Eventually, the doctor's staff called the police who dragged the woman away from the apparently unconscious doctor
