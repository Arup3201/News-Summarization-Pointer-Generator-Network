The parents of a four-year-old boy shot dead by his cousin of the same age have said charges against his grandparents should be dropped because the death was an accident.

Patricia
 Johnson, 53, and Robert Richardson, 66, from Detroit, Michigan, were arraigned yesterday on 
involuntary manslaughter and other charges in connection with Jamel Witcher Jr's death.

Police are still looking for the third suspect, the boy's grandfather Harvey Witcher, 55,
 who also faces charges in connection with the death.

Jamel was shot in the chest by his 
four-year-old cousin on Thursday after she found a loaded rifle in a 
bedroom of a home in Tuxedo, according to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office.

The boy's father, Jamel Witcher Sr,  has revealed all three live at the home. Johnson and Harvey Witcher are the grandparents and Richardson is married to Johnson but they are separated.

Johnson,
 who identified herself during the arraignment as Patricia Ann 
Johnson-Richardson, said she had been living in the home about six 
weeks, the Detroit Free Press reported.

It is believed Richardson was babysitting at the time the shooting happened.

Jamel Jr's parents said the gun should have been stored properly, but they don't believe anyone should have been charged.

The boy's mother, said Adrian Tubbs: 'I feel like it was an accident.'

Jamel Witcher said he spoke briefly by phone with Johnson, who he said is grieving over her grandson's death.

'She's real hurt,' he said. 'We're just trying to stay strong and hold up.'

Johnson
 and Richardson, who appeared in court yesterday via video link, were both arraigned on charges of involuntary manslaughter, 
second-degree child abuse, felon in possession of a firearm and felony 
firearm.

Richardson was also charged with careless discharge of a 
firearm causing injury or death.

Magistrate
 Meletios Golamatis ordered each held on $200,000 bonds. Johnson and 
Richardson are scheduled to be back in court January 31.

Both are habitual offenders, which Golamatis said enhanced penalties of their charges, the Detroit Free Press reported.

Witcher is also facing involuntary manslaughter, felon in possession of a firearm and felony firearm charges.

'These
 are absolutely the right charges in this profoundly sad case,' Wayne 
County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement Sunday.

'I hope that this sends another resounding message that guns and unsupervised young children will court nothing but disaster.'
