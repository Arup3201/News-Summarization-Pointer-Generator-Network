A baby bear which was tortured by Ukrainian keepers for the entertainment of tourists at Euro 2012 is on the road to recovery after being rescued by an animal charity.

Nastia the adorable five-month-old bear cub had been illegally sold by Lutsk zoo to animal traders in Vinnytsia, Ukraine and made to perform.

Heartbreaking images showed the young bear being grabbed by the neck and shoved into a tiny box, as her mother frantically paced her cage unable to intervene.

On the mend: Nastia has been freed from Ukrainian zoo keepers and vets now hope he can recover

Rescue: Dr Amil Khalil, from Four Paws animal charity, carries Nastia away from the zoo after the company worked with Ukrainian authorities to rescue her

Reunited: Vets hope Nastia will be able to see her mother again in the next few days

Campaigners from animal charity Four Paws had released the distressing footage in the hope of getting the zoo to reunite baby bear and mother.

While the youngster is screaming, the mother bear was shown racing around the cage and throwing herself at the metal mesh in a bid to get back to her cub.

The cub is then pushed down into a wooden box still shrieking - and it is nailed shut with a wire cover.

But since the footage was filmed, Four Paws have enlisted the help of Ukrainian authorities and have managed to free Nastia.

Recovery: Vets said Nastia has various health problems following her torture ordeal, but should be able to make it back to full health

New life: Vets have expressed concern, however, that Nastia's mother may not recognise her when the pair are reunited

Officials now hope to reunite the bear with its mother - although there are concerns that after so long apart the female may not recognise her offspring.

Nastia also has health concerns following her 'cruel' ordeal at the hands of zookeepers, with vets working on her recovery.

Dr. Amir Khalil, who examined Nastia after she was rescued, said: 'She is very anxious, malnourished and suffers from diarrhea.

'I was horrified to see the cruel treatment of Nastia and I am relieved that we could rescue her. But there is still so much work for us to do.'

'A baby bear in the wild usually spends two years with its mother. Taking it away so young would leave the tiny bear traumatised.

'In addition being used as a tourist attraction represents a lifetime in torment for the baby bear.

These heartbreaking pictures from Lutsk zoo in 
Ukraine show a bear cub is torn away from his mother and shoved 
screaming into a tiny box which is then nailed shut have been released 
to start a campaign to have the two reunited

'The sale of baby bears to private individuals is supposed to be illegal in the Ukraine.

'Although selling a zoo animal to a private buyer is illegal in Ukraine, the fine for this criminal action is only 60 Euros.

'We urge the government to strengthen the law and to establish more severe punishments in order to deter the ruthless animal traders.'
