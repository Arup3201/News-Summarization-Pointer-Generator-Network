As the part-time players of managerless Alloa Athletic punched the air in celebration of their latest point against Rangers, the scale of the job facing Stuart McCall veered into sharp focus.

Frankly, the new Ibrox boss faces the biggest uphill task since Sir Edmund Hillary conquered Everest if he is to succeed in getting this bunch of players back to the summit league of Scottish football.

On a night when Alloa left their shock new signing — ex-Sunderland and Newcastle striker Michael Chopra — on the bench until the dying embers of the match, a glancing header by former Chelsea kid Ben Gordon opened the scoring and had Rangers on the back foot.

Two goals from Nicky Clark in five minutes looked like somehow securing a rare victory for a stodgy and lethargic Rangers but Liam Buchanan’s late leveller ensured deserved parity for the team from the Wee County.

It was merely the latest sting from the Wasps, who have now drawn twice at Ibrox in the league this season, as well as holding Rangers at home in the Championship and knocking them out of the Petrofac Training Cup in Clackmannanshire.

For Ibrox fans, the elation of Dave King’s boardroom coup has very much been replaced by the utter deflation that comes as standard when watching this side.

Indeed, when McCall’s team travels to Easter Road on Sunday hoping to keep their play-off hopes alive, the second-most expensively assembled squad in the country can be said to pitch up in Leith in the grip of relegation-esque form.

Over the course of the last nine games — a quarter of a league season — third-placed Rangers have dropped 19 points from an available 27. In context, they have picked up eight points, while second-bottom Alloa and rock-bottom Livingston — who drew at Ibrox on Saturday — both have amassed six over the same time period.

And, worryingly for McCall, not even five changes to his starting line-up could inject any badly-needed urgency into proceedings.

There was a first-team recall for goalkeeper Cammy Bell, who was pulling on a Rangers jersey for the first time in seven months after recovering from a shoulder injury. That meant Lee Robinson was on the bench, with veteran keeper Steve Simonson dropping out of the squad altogether.

Injuries meant Rangers were without defender Sebastian Faure and attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, who has been one of the Ibrox club’s best players since arriving on loan from Newcastle United. Striker Kenny Miller dropped to the bench, while Kyle Hutton found himself left out of the squad completely. But the team news that stood out was Chopra, who took his place on the bench and would remain there for most of the evening.

In front of a crowd of 28,902, the first chance fell to Rangers. Lee Wallace raced down the left and his cross found its way to Clark, who turned and shot over the bar.

Then captain Lee McCulloch seized on a corner and, when his first effort was blocked, his subsequent shot went out for a throw-in. The grumbles from the Ibrox stands began on 12 minutes. With each passing minute they grew louder.

But young Tom Walsh gave them something to get excited about when he picked up a pass from Dean Shiels and sent a 20-yarder narrowly over the top of Craig McDowall’s crossbar.

Kris Boyd then had a chance after good work down the left from Shiels. But his turn and shot ended with the ball being fired straight down McDowall’s throat. Young Andrew Murdoch then had a firm shot saved easily by McDowall.

In the best move of the match, Walsh powered down the right and slipped a clever ball into the overlapping Wallace, but the full-back’s ball across goal was turned over his own bar by Michael Doyle.

On a rare foray up the park, Kevin Cawley sent a weak right-foot shot from distance scampering wide of Bell’s goal.

It had been a listless first half and the jeers at half-time were from fans who sounded wearily accustomed to this type of fare.

There were more jeers at the start of the second half when the Ibrox support were beseeching their side to show some attacking urgency, only for Darren McGregor to take the safe option of a back-pass from the halfway line to keeper Bell.

Worse was to follow when Alloa scored with their first meaningful effort on goal. Michael Docherty’s free-kick was glanced home by Gordon as Ibrox was left stunned, but not surprised.

‘Cancel their day off this week anaw Stuart,’ shouted a furious lone voice at the back of the Bill Struth Main Stand.

Rangers nearly levelled with a header from Marius Zalkiukas but McDowall was equal to it as he pulled off a diving save.

McCall’s side got back into it, however, when McCulloch’s deflected shot hit the bar and Clark cleverly diverted the ball with his head into the bottom corner past the stranded McDowall. Clark then thought he had won the match when he headed in a fine cross from the left by substitute David Templeton.

Buchanan’s intervention in the 82nd minute, when he superbly chipped the ball over Bell and into the net, put paid to that idea.

Buchanan was replaced by Chopra in the 95th minute but there was no time for the journeyman, who has cost £9.5million in transfer fees over the course of his troubled career, to become a hero.

But, as the Alloa players milked their standing ovation from their hardy bunch of fans, the jeers and shouts of ‘disgrace’ that greeted the Rangers players at the final whistle left everyone in no doubt who, once again, were the villains of the piece.
