Google has taken a fight with the Wall Street Journal to a new level - by countering what it sees as misleading, inaccurate reporting with a gif of a laughing baby.

The search giant turned to fodder more usually seen on teenage blogs and social media in an escalating conflict based on a Federal Trade Commission report uncovered by the Wall Street Journal. 

The search giant used the looping clip while retaliating against an article in the newspaper which quoted the report, which uncovered officials' reservations about Google's business practices, and was supposed to remain private.

It also took umbrage to the suggestion that Google staff members visiting the White House 230 times President Obama took office could have affected the probe.

Ultimately the FTC concluded that it wasn't worth trying to sue Google, and instead negotiated changes to its practices, which the company implemented.

But rather than respond directly to what it saw as the Journal's inaccurate reporting, Google posted the cutesy image and implied that the newspapers' publishers were being hypocrites.

Implications: Whetstone's post took aim at Wall Street Journal owner Rupert Murdoch, whose lower-brow publications were also given a mention

Rachel Whetstone, senior vice president in Google's Communications and Policy department, wrote the post, which began with aspersions against News Corp, the company which ultimately owns the journal.

She said: 'Last year Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp, accused Google of creating a "less informed, more vexatious level of dialogue in our society."

'Given the tone of some of your publications, that made quite a few people chuckle.'

She then followed up with the baby gif.

The mention of the 'tone' of some News Corp titles is evidently a reference to the fact that, as well as the Journal, News Corp ultimately owns the New York Post tabloid, as well as The Sun in Britain.

She also responded to the Journal's supposed claims that Google has 'undue political influence' by linking to a famous Sun front page claiming that its endorsement swayed the country's 1992 general election.

Only then did Whetstone, a former high-ranking political adviser for the British Conservative Party, address a list of grievances with the Journal's report, which cited instances when FTC officials recommended suing Google.

She also drew in another report which pointed out that Google's 230+ meetings at the White House during Obama's presidency, and cited an FTC statement saying the Journal had been 'misleading' by juxtaposing that fact with reporting on the anti-competitive practices investigation.

After citing a number of other rulings vindicating, by state-level government bodies and also officials in Europe, Whetstone fired off another gif - this one a jubilant Jewish New Yorker winning an argument.

The piece was a seemingly rare intervention by Whetstone, who hadn't written a blog for Google since 2012. 

A recourse to gifs in otherwise serious discussion isn't unprecedented. In January, House Speaker John Boehner fired off a salvo of 12 Taylor Swift gifs to trash the President's community college plans.

A spokesman for the Democrats responded in time, harnessing the pop icon to declare 'Haters gonna hate' over Twitter.
