Duewa Lee (pictured), 37, was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday for brutally torturing her fiancee's 12-year-old daughter

A Northern California woman who burned, whipped and brutalized her fiancé's daughter while he was in prison has been convicted of torture and sentenced to life behind bars.

A judge sentenced 37-year-old Duewa Lee immediately following her conviction by a jury on Thursday on 11 felony counts.

Lee received an indeterminate life term on the torture conviction, plus another nine years for the other counts related to the abuses endured by the girl.

The girl was 12 at the time of the abuse and is now 14.

She told jurors that over several months Lee burned her with an iron and hot spatulas, threw her down stairs, refused to let her eat, smashed her head into a window and forced her to stand for hours.

'I had to stand in the corner, and I had to hold both of my hands up in the air, and I had to hold one of my legs up,' said the 12- year-old victim in her testimony in the Sacramento Superior court on Tuesday.

Deputy District Attorney Nancy Cochrane said in her opening statement that the abuse began when the girl's father, Wade Curtis Carter, who is now 40, was arrested for robbery in 2011 and then imprisoned.

According to The Sacramento Bee Lee had six children of her own and was pregnant with a seventh by the imprisoned Carter.

According to Assistant Public Defender Mike Nelson, 'Duewa Lee did not cause the injuries to (the girl), her father did.'

The girl said in her testimony on Tuesday that she got in trouble with her father on occasion for lying and was forced to stand in a corner.

He never made her raise her hands in the air and lift one foot off the floor. 

Everything was generally OK in the home, the girl testified, until her father's arrest in 2011.

Then, she said, Lee gave her housework and yelled at her. Her relationship with Lee crumbled.

The girl told how she was standing in Lee's bedroom corner one night and, 'she turned her iron on, and she thought I was lying about something, and she burned me with the iron...

'She was yelling in my face, and she burned me. … She said something about her being pregnant and me trying to make her feel bad.'

'She would say, "This is what you get" for whatever I did,' the girl told the jury.

According to United Press International, the victim has been in protective custody ever since she got help from a DMV employee. Lee took the child to the DMV, and when Lee was in the bathroom, the victim pleaded for help. Investigators took the victim to get medical attention for her injuries. They believe that was the first time any of her wounds were treated

Sacramento Child protective Services also took Lee's six biological children into custody. They would not comment on their condition.
