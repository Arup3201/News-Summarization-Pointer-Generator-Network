The biggest space-wasters are old clothing which is never worn, DVDs and VHS videos

Britain is a nation of hoarders with the typical house filled with 3,540 pounds worth of unused clutter, a new study found.

Almost two thirds of Brits say they 'dislike' the amount of junk in their home and a quarter even say it makes them 'stressed'.

But many householders do nothing about it because they fear they may need their items one day or attach sentimental value to them.

A third say they do not have time for a
clearout and 12 per cent feel guilty about throwing out or selling 
gifts somebody else had bought.

The
biggest space-wasters are old clothing which is never worn, DVDs and 
VHS videos, the study by online noticeboard gumtree.com found.

These are followed by shoes, kids' toys and computer games.

The value of all clutter is worth a staggering Â£93billion nationally.

One in five homes have enough unwanted items to fill an average bathroom and a similar number enough to fill an entire bedroom.

But the junk is generally spread around the house, most commonly in cupboards, wardrobes, under beds and in garages or sheds.

Some people even admit to keeping items in bathtubs, car boots and the fridge to hide them from view, the poll of 2,000 people found.

Four in ten people say the clutter makes them feel disorganised and a third 'worry' about their home looking messy to visitors.

The type of clutter stored by men and women varies, with women typically having seven pairs of unused shoes while men have just five.

However, men have an average of two old MP3 players, with 7 per cent even hoarding seven or more. Women have an average of one.

Both genders keep two old mobile phones as 'spares'.

Self-confessed hoarder James Evans, from Southampton, Hampshire, never throws anything away.

The 46-year-old banker said: 'My cupboards and lofts are filled with old gadgets and items that most people may call junk.

'However, I would kick myself if I threw something away and then found I needed it a few months down the line.

'I realise my clutter takes up a lot of space and may be worth a small fortune but I like keeping spares of everything.'

Author and broadcaster Jamie Breese, who has written about decluttering, said getting rid of clutter makes people feel happier.

He said: 'The vast majority of UK households underestimate the value of their unwanted items so aren't aware of just how much value is sitting in their cupboards and under their beds.

'With some people even stashing their clutter in car boots and in washing machines, it's obvious that it's time for a spring clean.

'I'd urge everyone to set aside a weekend to have a good declutter session and think about what they could sell.'

He added: 'Many of us upgrade constantly to new technology and we are getting new phones, laptops and mp3 players every year.

'This is leading to many men having a 'gadget graveyard' of slightly outdated technology, but technology which is still worth a lot of money.

'In some cases, very early mobile phones and early home computers, such as the Sinclair ZX80, can be worth more money today.

'I once read that all clutter is postponed decisions, which is an eloquent and revealing description.

'Your motivation really should be to free yourself. It's amazing how good you and your loved ones feel once you've had fun with a clutterbust.'

Hamish Stone, from Gumtree.com, said: 'For any households looking for a quick and easy way to find extra space in their homes, a good spring clean session can really help.

'With many homes across the UK now wasting whole rooms storing unwanted items, a good clear out can really make a difference.

'We'd urge everyone to try to sell their unwanted items, as chances are, there is probably someone local to you looking for exactly the item that is lurking in your loft or hiding in your shed.'
