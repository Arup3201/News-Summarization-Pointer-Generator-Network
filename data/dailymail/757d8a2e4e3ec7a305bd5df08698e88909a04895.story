She first captivated her nation with her 'bottle-shaped figure' in the 1950s.

Then Isabel Sarli went on to national fame in the '60s and '70s as the first Argentinian actress to perform fully-frontal nudity on camera.

And now Sarli, 77, is still turning heads - but today it is after becoming the nation's ambassador for pop culture.

President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said the national sex symbol would be 'a true representative of national culture' as its new ambassador.

She added: 'It is as much for her acting skills in films as for being considered a popular icon of her day and an emblematic figure of Argentine cinema.'

Ready for fame: Isabel Sarll as Miss Argentina (centre) in Long Beach, California in July 1955

Sarli started her career as a model before winning the prestigious Miss Argentina competition in 1955.

She became known as 'Coca Sarli' - depending on who you ask, it is because of her bottle-shaped figure or her addiction to the soft drink

She was spotted by filmmaker Armando Bó and went on to star in some 30 low-level erotic films during the 1960s and 1970s.

With titles such as Fire, Meat, Love and Sex, Naked Temptation and Tropical Ecstasy, she incurred the wrath of censors who dubbed her movies as 'dirty'.

Her new role is of undersecretary and she will work within the remit of the Ministry of Culture.

Isabel Sarlin may have been a trailblazer in the world of pornography - being the first Argentinian to appear in film fully nude - but she is not the first porn actress to make the switch to politics.

Josefin Brink, born 1969, is a Swedish Left Party politician, who admitted to working as a stripper at a club in Gothenburg in the 1990s.

She said she began to strip to make extra money - up to a few thousand pounds an evening - at a time when she was drinking heavily.

Stormy Daniels stood for a Senate seat in 2010

Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has long kept the world bemused with his sexual activities, but it is not the first time an Italian MP has raised a few eyebrows.

Anna Ilona Staller, born 1951, started life in hardcore pornography films before switching to another sleazy profession - becoming a member of Parliament in 1979.

She became known for delivering political speeches with one breast exposed, and continued acting in roles - and in Playboy - during her political career.

Her campaigns included the right to have sex in prison, decriminalisation of drugs, and opposition to all forms of violence,

America's not had a porn star in government - yet.

But in 2010, Stormy Daniels, 33, an American pornographic actress, screenwriter and director. was asked to run against incumbent David Vitter for the Senate election in Louisiana.

Finally deciding she was a Republican, she began running in July 2009, but stepped down in April 2010, after a reported bomb attack on her manager's car.
