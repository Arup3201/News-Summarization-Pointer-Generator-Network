George Groves has warned Carl Froch he is in a fight that he can't win and reiterated his boast that he will settle their fight in three rounds at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.

The pair come face to face in an eagerly anticipated rematch after Froch was controversially adjudged to have beaten Groves last November.

And Froch, in an open training session in his hometown of Nottingham on Monday, claimed that he will knock Groves out.

Local lad: George Groves held an open training session in West London ahead of his fight with Carl Froch 

Disciplined: Groves went through some shadow work before working on the pads with his trainer Paddy Fitzgerald

Working hard: After the session was complete Groves spoke to the press and claimed he would knock Froch out in three rounds

But the Londoner laughed off those assertions in an open workout in Shepherd's Bush on Tuesday afternoon.

He
 told Sky Sports: 'Froch is banking on the fact that he's a 12-round 
fighter and I'm not but he's in for a rude awakening because will be a 
breeze.

'When
 I say three rounds I'm not talking about a three round fight. I don't 
need to come out and empty the tank in three rounds. I'm going to go out
 and do what I do. I don't think Carl Froch would even last three rounds
 at that pace.

'The
 fact of the matter is that if Carl is in better shape or he does manage
 to withstand the punishment past six rounds then it will only get 
worse. It will get worse for him round on round as I will get faster, 
fitter stronger as I get more and more settled into the bout.

'What
 people have misunderstood before is that just because Carl Froch a lot 
of the time doesn't mean that he works for 12 rounds. It doesn't mean 
that I can't go 12 rounds because I knock most of my opponents out 
before 12 rounds. 

'And
 at the end of the last fight I was in far better condition than Carl 
Froch was so I am not worried at all about conditioning and I know I can
 go more than 12 rounds if need be, but the fact of the matter is I 
don't think Carl is going to go past three.'

Rematch: Groves will fight Froch in front of a sell out crowd at Wembley Stadium on Saturday evening

Controversy: There has been bad blood between the pair since Froch was deemed to have beaten Groves in November

Slogan: Groves had 'Everything for a reason' and the date of the fight sewn into his boots

Anticipation: A big crowd turned out to watch Groves warm up for the showdown with Froch

Froch had said that he refused to be wound up by Groves' psychological warfare, or even listen to it.

But Groves countered by insisting that there was no such tactics employed by him. He was simply a better fighter and felt ready to prove it in the ring on Saturday.

He said: 'I'm not really fussed. I don't use it as a motivational tool and I'm certainly not dependent on it in a fight. Technically, in a boxing sense, I beat Carl Froch every day of the week. If he wants fall apart mentally so be it, if he needs to coach himself not to fall apart then I wish him the best of luck.

'So far in the build-up I'm sure he has felt good at times and I'm sure he has felt vulnerable at times but everything for a reason. He should always look at himself in the mirror and ask "I feel good today. Why do I feel good? Have I been allowed to feel good?" because nothing is left to chance with me.

'I told him that at the very first press conference everything for a reason and we're in fight week now and he needs to understand that his destiny is dawning.

'Saturday night is fast approaching and he needs to get himself in check, he needs to get himself up for this fight and for that, again, I wish him luck because he is in a fight he can't win. And it is not because he is not good enough. I am sure he is good enough but I won't allow him to win.'
