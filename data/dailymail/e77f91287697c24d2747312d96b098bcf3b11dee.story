Split: Andrew Mitchell resigned last week after a month of controversy

The Prime Minister was forced to defend his handling of the Andrew Mitchell affair yesterday, insisting the former Chief Whip’s rant at Downing Street police was not serious enough to cost him his job.

The Prime Minister said Mr Mitchell finally resigned because of the ‘bigger question’ of whether he would be able to do his job properly, having had his  authority over MPs undermined.

Mr Cameron – widely criticised for allowing the issue to drag on for a month – appeared irritated as he was questioned over his refusal to sack the minister in a series of TV interviews yesterday.

Mr Mitchell has denied police claims he called officers ‘plebs’ and ‘morons’ after they asked him to use a side entrance to Number Ten, rather than opening the main gate for him and his bicycle.

But he admitted swearing during the altercation and finally quit on Friday night after senior colleagues told him and the Prime Minister he could not continue.

Mr Cameron, speaking on ITV’s The Agenda programme last night, said: ‘The decision I had to make right at the beginning was: Was it right for him to apologise and did the police accept that apology and therefore could he get on and do his job? I took that decision. Some people would criticise that and say, “Why not just sack him straight away?” I don’t think that would have been the right thing to do. But obviously we found after a period of time he couldn’t do his job so he had to resign.’

He added: ‘I think as PM you’ve got to ... if someone has apologised you need to give them a chance to do their job. I tried, whether it was Liam Fox’s resignation, I tried ... rather than just do the easy thing quick at the lobby meeting at 11 o’clock meeting and have the person out the door which Tony Blair sometimes did.’

‘It's the easiest thing in the world as Prime Minister to just sack someone at the drop of a hat when something goes wrong. I thought the right thing to do was to make sure there was a proper apology,’ he said.

‘The police didn't want to take it further but it did become apparent he wasn't going to be able to do his job so the right conclusion was reached.

‘It takes longer to discover whether someone can or can't do their job. It's much easier just to fire people, I actually think that is not the right approach.’

Yesterday Education Secretary Michael Gove revealed Mr Cameron did not believe Mr Mitchell should have lost his job because of ‘seven seconds of madness’ in Downing Street.

The revelation raised fresh questions about Mr Cameron’s judgment among Tory MPs – who are still reeling from Mr Mitchell’s dramatic resignation after four weeks of controversy about his foul-mouthed rant at police officers.

Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, claimed the PM had not learned any lessons from 'this shambles'.

He added: 'While everyone else can see how wrong Andrew Mitchell was, the Prime Minister is still completely out of touch.  David Cameron should stop trying to blame other people for his own weakness and dithering - and start taking some responsibility.'

Mr Gove risked reopening the row with the Police Federation, by suggesting that the officers’ recollection of former Chief Whip Mr Mitchell’s rant may have been wrong.

He said: ‘There’s a Japanese film, I think it’s called Rashomon, in which different participants who see the same event all have different recollections of it. I wasn’t there. I trust Andrew, and I’m always inclined to give him the benefit of any doubt.’

One Tory MP said yesterday he was ‘staggered’ that Mr Mitchell had not been sacked as soon as news broke of his confrontation. Another said the Prime Minister had been ‘misguided’, while a third accused him of presiding over a ‘catastrophe’ that would do lasting damage to the party’s image.

In a further blow, former Conservative Party chairman Lord Tebbit accused Mr Cameron of leading a ‘dog of a coalition government’ that had let itself be portrayed as ‘a government of unfeeling toffs’.

Mr Mitchell finally quit the Cabinet on Friday night, saying he had lost the backing of the Parliamentary party.

Senior ministers, including Home Secretary Theresa May, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Mr Mitchell’s own deputy John Randall, were among those who told him he should go for the good of the party. Mrs May made no attempt to deny her role yesterday, telling the BBC: ‘I’m not going to talk about private conversations. Andrew has resigned. I think that is an end to the issue.’

Accepting Mr Mitchell’s resignation on Friday, Mr Cameron hinted at a possible comeback. And Mr Gove revealed that the Prime Minister still believed Mr Mitchell should be in the Cabinet.

He told Sky News: ‘David Cameron wanted to keep Andrew, I wanted Andrew to stay because I don’t believe and the Prime Minister doesn’t believe that 30 years of public service should be effaced at a stroke by seven seconds of unacceptable but very human exasperation.

‘But Andrew came to that decision and he did so because he wanted to put the interests of the party collectively ahead of his own.’ Mr Gove repeated the claim in a later interview, saying the Prime Minister had ‘wanted him to stay on’.

He acknowledged that the row had overshadowed good news on the economy last week, but said the public would see through the ‘froth’, noting that Tony Blair had won three elections despite a string of scandals involving ministers in his government.

Mr Gove’s comments came as backbenchers broke cover to voice their dismay at the Prime Minister’s handling of recent events. Tory MP Andrew Percy said he had told his whip as soon as the original story broke that Mr Mitchell ought to be removed because it would ‘run and run and run’.

‘I was frankly a bit staggered at the time that Downing Street hadn’t picked up on the whole mess earlier,’ he said.

Mr Percy added: ‘A lot of the problems we are facing at the moment are not problems about the economy but actually it’s stuff we have made ourselves. The disasters or shambles that are created wholly within Westminster or within Downing Street.’

Brian Binley, secretary of the backbench 1922 Committee, described Mr Cameron’s decision to bring back Old Etonian Sir George Young to replace Mr Mitchell as a ‘comfort-zone appointment’.

He added: ‘I’m afraid it points to very poor man-management – David is the sort of guy who wants people around him who is comfortable with rather than people who will challenge him.’

MP Philip Davies said Mr Cameron had been ‘misguided’ to hang on to Mr Mitchell, adding: ‘It was handled badly. Andrew Mitchell should have resigned, I think when he didn’t resign the Prime Minister should have sacked him.’

In an article for the Observer, Lord Tebbit wrote: ‘This dog of a coalition government has let itself be given a bad name and now anybody can beat it.

‘It has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs. Past governments have had far more real Tory toffs: prime ministers Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Macmillan, or even in Thatcher’s day, Whitelaw, Soames, Hailsham, Carrington, Gowrie, Joseph, Avon, Trenchard and plenty more, without incurring similar abuse.’
