The two men behind the Iraq invasion that led to today’s crisis were busy enjoying themselves yesterday.

Tony Blair and George W Bush showed little concern over the execution of Mr Foley and the continuing carnage in Gaza.

Mr Blair, now the Special Envoy to the Middle East, was pictured over the weekend on his summer holiday in shorts, flip-flops and sunglasses.

And yesterday George Bush issued an ill-timed video of him taking part in the latest video craze called the Ice Bucket Challenge, where a bucket of water is poured over his head.

Mr Blair is currently enjoying ‘la dolce vita’ on Lipari, the largest of the Aeolian islands off the north coast of Sicily.

He and wife Cherie were staying there as guests of wealthy industrialist Massimo Carello and his wife Sara, who have a luxurious villa on the island.

The Blairs were seen out and about dining on prawns and seafood platters at several of Lipari’s best restaurants, and on a yacht belonging to one of Mr Carello’s friends. It is thought the Blairs left Lipari on Tuesday, but it is not clear where they were heading.

Mr Blair is officially the Special Envoy for the Middle East on behalf of the Quartet - the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia - with a brief to help broker peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.

But his role might be expected to see him take a wider interest in the region. The last post on his official website was on July 31 when he welcomed the (as it turned out, short-lived) Gaza ceasefire and said he hoped it would secure ‘a broad, sustainable and long-term solution to the crisis’.

Together 
with former George W. Bush, Mr Blair has faced criticism for his 
handling of the Iraq war while Prime Minister and the toppling of Iraqi 
dictator Saddam Hussein without carefully laying the foundations for a 
post-Saddam regime.

Yesterday,
 hours after the video of US journalist James Foley being beheaded by an
 Islamic State militant was put on the internet, Mr Bush posted a video 
of himself clowning around and having a bucket of water poured over his 
head on his own Facebook page.

He
 was taking part in the so-called ice bucket challenge, which has caught
 on with notable figures participating in the campaign to raise money 
for the fight against ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, a progressive 
neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the 
spinal cord.

The former president's wife Laura Bush pours water over him before he nominates his predecessor Bill Clinton

The stunt was poorly timed - it was released just hours after video showing journalist James Foley being beheaded was publicly released

In the video, Mr Bush nominates Bill Clinton, his predecessor as U.S. president, to take the challenge next.

Mr Bush said: ‘To you all who challenged me, I do not think it’s presidential for me to be splashed with ice water, so I’m simply going to write you a check’, before his wife Laura Bush comes into shot, douses him and says: ‘That check is from me - I didn’t want to ruin my hairstyle.’

Former Fiat executive Mr Carello previously provided hospitality to the Blairs in 2006 when Mrs Blair stayed at his mansion on a hill overlooking Turin while she attended events as an ambassador for the London 2012 Olympics.

Mrs Carello is a trustee of the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women.

Mr Blair infamously enjoyed a free holiday in Sardinia at the 27-bedroom villa of since-disgraced Italian premier and billionaire Silvio Berlusconi in 2004.

That jolly was much remarked on at the time - both because Labour MPs were appalled at their leader accepting hospitality from such a sleazy Right-wing host, and the fact Berlusconi sported a ridiculous bandana during their public appearances, to conceal the aftermath of a hair transplant.

In August last year, while there was a crisis in Syria after claims of a chemical weapons attack in Damascus, Mr Blair was to be found in Sardinia again, this time on a superyacht owned by American music mogul David Geffen, and then in St Tropez, the perennial playground of the international playboy.

Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Blair declined to discuss what he was doing in Lipari.
