Arsenal right back Mathieu Debuchy has celebrated his move to the north London outfit by getting two fresh tattoos inked onto his lower legs. 

The Frenchman has added to his range of tattoos by getting two different designs on his right and left calves.

Debuchy seems to still be in World Cup mode as he has decided to get an image of Christ the Redeemer tattooed onto his left leg.

The 29-year-old, who also seems to have jazzed up his hairstyle, has opted for an Aztec print on his right leg.

The former Newcastle defender will be hoping his side can progress to the group stages of the Champions League by defeating Besiktas at the Emirates Stadium. 

Debuchy seems to have established himself as Arsene Wenger's first choice right back as the £10million summer signing has started all three of Arsenal's competitive games  so far this season.
