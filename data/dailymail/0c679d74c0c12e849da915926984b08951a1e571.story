As baby photos go, this collection has got to be one of the most adorable. And certainly the most magical.

A mother who admits being completely obsessed with fairy tales commissioned a professional photographer to take a series of beautiful images of her baby daughter, and in all of them her little girl adopts the starring role in all her favourite stories, including Alice in Wonderland, Little Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White.

The pictures of baby girl Maddie, daughter of Nicole Lepper of Monmouth, Illinois, were taken by American photographer Wendi Riggins in Iowa.

Time for tea? Baby Maddie dressed up as Alice in Wonderland, playing with cards and 'eat me' cakes at the Mad Hatter's Tea Party

Maddie's mum Nicole, wanted some special pictures of her fourth child, and they were taken when Maddie was six to nine months old.

Wendi, 30, said: 'Nicole, loves fairy tales, and her entire family are fans of the TV show Once Upon a Time. It was from this love that the concept of baby fairy tales came about.

'Nicole planned and shopped for the perfect outfits and pieces. We talked multiple times a week, throwing around ideas, picking out props and brainstorming on ways to make each and every set perfect.'

Wendi explained that she had to figure out the best way to shoot the session and keep a nine-month-old subject happy, 'knowing that most babies don't have the tolerance or attention span for a long shoot'.

She said: 'With six sets to plan, I knew we would have to work quickly, and that setting up and tearing down sets would be the most time consuming part of the shoot.

'We worked quickly, knowing we only need a few really good images of each set, once I felt confident that I had the perfect shot, we moved onto the next set.

'We only spent about 10 minutes for each set, and then let Maddie crawl and play in between to keep her happy.'

Wendi continued: 'Her favourite sets 
were Snow White and Alice, she loved the apples and cookie. She started 
to get fussy when we got to Cinderella, our last indoor set, until she 
saw the soap bubbles. Those immediately cheered her up.

'Maddie
was the perfect baby for the session, and her mom, Nicole, had the 
perfect vision. Together, we were able to create something truly unique 
that both mother and daughter will treasure.

'When
we blogged the images, we never expected them to be as popular as they 
are. I blog so that my clients can share their sessions with their 
families, and for potential clients to get an idea of my current work 
and my style.

'To have the images go viral like they have has been incredible. We have received so many compliments and emails.'

Maddie takes a seat and prepares to settle down with a good book of her favourite fairy tales

Alice in Wonderland (or is that Maddie?) just couldn't resist having a nibble of the 'eat me' biscuits, and will have to wait patiently to see whether they will make her grow or shrink

Maddie dresses up as the dinkiest Cinderella ever (before she met her Fairy Godmother and swapped her cleaning clothes for a ballgown), left, and then gets some inspiration for her next costume change by settling down to read her big book of fairy tales, right

Maddie wonders whether or not to drop her little mousey friend in the bucket of soapy water, left, and plays the prettiest Snow White there ever was, right
