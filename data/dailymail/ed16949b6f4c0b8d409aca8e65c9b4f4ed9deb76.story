A teenage driver who killed his best friend in a car crash just two weeks after passing his test has been jailed for two years.

Jay Haines, 18, was today locked up for two years after giving five of his friends a lift home in his small Suzuki car.

'Show off' Haines hit a parked car while speeding which led to his friend Morgan Hackling, 19, dying as a result of his injuries.

A court heard that McDonald’s worker Haines, of Risca, Newport, 17 at the time, had passed his driving test just two weeks before.

It has also emerged that the youth was stopped by police just four days earlier to the incident, for speeding and warned the teenager for 'showing off to his friends'.

Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett said that Haines had offered the five teenagers a lift home after finishing his late shift in McDonald’s.

Jailed: Cardiff Crown Court heard that the music from the car's stereo was 'excessively loud' and none of the five passengers were wearing seatbelts

With a total of six people travelling in the car, Morgan was in the front seat of the Suzuki Alto while another friend lay across the laps of three others sitting in the back.

Cardiff Crown Court heard that the music from the car’s stereo was 'excessively loud' and none of the five passengers were wearing seatbelts.

Haines hit a parked Renault at 1.35am while traveling at up to 48mph in a 30mph zone in Risca, near Newport, South Wales.

Passenger Morgan was trapped for 30 minutes before being cut free, but died from his sustained neck injuries in hospital.

Haines pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving.

Harry Baker, defending Jay Haines, said: 'His lack of driving experience contributed to the accident.

'He is remorseful and has struggled to come to terms with what happened.'

Haines was sentenced to two years and three months in a young offender’s institution and banned from driving for three years.

Judge Eleri Rees QC told him: 'The consequences for you and your family are serious and life changing but that cannot be compared with the loss for Morgan Hackling’s family - theirs is significantly worse.

“When you have served your sentence you can, with your family and friends, rebuild your life.

'The guilt and feeling of responsibility for having taken another life will always be with you and will be a punishment you will always bear.

'For Morgan’s family there is no way of finding comfort - your sentence will not diminish their sense of loss.'
