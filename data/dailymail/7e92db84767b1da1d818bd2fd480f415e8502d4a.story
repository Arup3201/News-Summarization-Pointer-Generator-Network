Astronomers have spotted a heart-shaped crater on the surface of Mars.

Located close to a huge volcano or the surface of the red planet, Nasa says the strange shape may have been caused by a volcano.

However, the space agency is so intrigued by the unusual shape is plans to train its telescopes on the 'broken heart' again to try and work out exactly how big it is.

The heart is located south of Ascraeus Mons, which is a large volcano within the Tharsis volcanic plateau, so it is extremely likely that this feature was formed by a volcanic process.

'The feature indeed does look like a heart,' researchers on Nasa's HiRISE telescope, which took the image, said.

It is located south of Ascraeus Mons, which is a large volcano within the Tharsis volcanic plateau, so it is extremely likely that this feature was formed by a volcanic process.

'The feature rises above the surrounding terrain and we can see concentric ridges on its top.

'Perhaps this feature is an ancient vent structure (an opening in the ground from which volcanic lava emerges) that has been more resistant to erosion than the surrounding area, so that it resembles 'inverted' terrains,' said Nasa.

Topographic inversion or inverted terrain often occurs when low areas of a landscape become filled with lava or sediments that harden into materials which are more resistant to erosion than the materials that surround them.

Erosion then removes the less resistant surrounding material, leaving behind the younger resistant material which may then appear as a ridge where previously there was a valley, or in this case, a butte, where there was once a pit or depression. 

The agency now plans to return to try and measure the ridges.Additional imaging of the feature to create a stereo and a digital terrain model may help in further assessing the structure by making accurate measurement of its height and the steepness of its slopes.

The blue planet: Nasa also released these false colour images which show dunes on the surface. The lighter toned tan surfaces are composed of a thick layer of dust, Nasa said.

The team also revealed this new image of pruple sand on the surface.

Sand on Mars is typically dark in tone, as it commonly derived from volcanic rocks like lava flows.

In HiRISE enhanced color, which operates in long infrared wavelengths (beyond what the human eye can detect), surfaces like these dune crests are dark blue to purple.

Sand comes in sizes that are ideal for surface transport by the wind, where sand 'hops' along forming bedforms, like these dunes after large amounts of time.
