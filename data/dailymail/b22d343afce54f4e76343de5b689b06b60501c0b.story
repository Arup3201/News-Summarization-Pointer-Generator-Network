A mother has been charged with felony child abuse of her  14-month-old son after she violently jammed his ears with Q-tips.

Jenna Schumacher, of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, allegedly caused her son's ears to bleed and left holes in his ear drums which could lead to lasting hearing problems.

The mother reportedly told investigators that she harmed her little boy because her partner left her and she 'can’t stand to look at (the child) because he looks so similar to his father'.

The 26-year-old faces up to 40 years in prison if she is found guilty of the abuse and $100,000 in fines.

The alleged abuse was discovered on November 5 at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin when Schumacher brought her son to see a doctor over his ear injuries.

The criminal complaint said doctors found no medical reason for the ear injuries, but discovered a piece of a cotton swab in the boy's ear. 

Last Friday, Schumacher again took her child to Children's Hospital and denied putting anything in his ears. 

However hospital video footage revealed that the 26-year-old was shoving cotton swabs and her fingers into her son's ears.

On the tape, the mom was seen violently forcing the Q-tip repeatedly into the child's ears as he struggled and cried, according to WITI. 

She initially denied her actions, then admitted that she was violent towards the child because he looked like his father, according to investigators. 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke on Thursday. 

He told WTVR: 'It turns my stomach. It sickens me. It makes you shudder to think someone would take a blunt object and shove it into your ear canal. It sends chills up your spine.' 

The abuse was uncovered at the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin after authorities set up surveillance cameras to watch the little boy's room
