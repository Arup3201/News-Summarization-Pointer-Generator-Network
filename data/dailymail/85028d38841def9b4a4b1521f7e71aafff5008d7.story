Postman: John Bircham (pictured in 1987) was a prolific striker for amateur side Dulverton Town FC

This is the first picture of a 57-year-old postman who died while completing his rounds in thick snow on Exmoor while trying to push his Royal Mail van after it became stuck in a snowdrift.

John Bircham, who had been a postman since the late 1980s, collapsed as he battled the snow and icy conditions at the end of his deliveries in and around Dulverton, Somerset, on Saturday.

The father of two - who was once a prolific striker for local amateur side Dulverton Town Football Club in the 1970s - was towed out of a snowdrift by a farmer before soon collapsing.

Friends paid tribute today to the ‘quiet, friendly’ father of sons Wayne and Jamie, who had lived in Dulverton all his life and well-liked in the town.

School friend John Atkins, secretary for the the Taunton & District Saturday Football League club, said a tribute would be held by the team to Mr Bircham, whom he described as a keen sportsman and a credit to his community.

He said: ‘As a footballer, John was as tough as nails - players used to bounce off him. But he was very gentle. There was never any nastiness in his play. If someone tried to tackle him, he'd just laugh. He was a very skilful player.

'I'm not being critical to our other former players, but John was one of the few who put something back into the club when he finished playing.

'He would turn up to watch and sell tickets for the club draw. He actually sold more tickets than anyone this year, so it was a very popular thing indeed when John's name was drawn first out of the hat to win the £100 first prize.’

The town council’s vice-chairman Ian Fleming said Mr Bircham was ‘held in high regard’ in Dulverton and ‘people would often see him with his grandchildren, happy and smiling’.

Mr Fleming added: ‘He did a lot for the people of this town and the surrounding area. John really did go to great lengths for people, not just with his deliveries. He was a real family man.’

Royal Mail last night confirmed Mr Bircham's death and paid tribute to his 25 years' service.

Dulverton sub-postmaster Chris Dubery said: ‘He was as hard-working a person as you'll ever meet, very dedicated to his collections and to the people of this town. He was a very quiet man, and the customers loved him.

‘He was very considerate towards them, always helping them out. He will be missed.’

Chris Nelder, a Dulverton town councillor, said: ‘This has come as quite a shock and news of Mr Bircham’s death has obviously spread very quickly through the area where he was very well known.

‘He was delivering out towards East Anstey and as I understand it was stuck in a snowdrift and was unable to get any traction on the tyres of his van.

‘A farmer who was out in his tractor came to his aid and had offered to tow him out but despite his best efforts and the first responder locally and the air ambulance Mr Bircham couldn’t be revived.

‘He was Dulverton born and bred and had had a delivery round in and around the town for 25 years so he knew an awful lot of people and they knew him even if only by sight travelling around the lanes.’

A local Post Office source said: ‘I think
the road was blocked by a fallen tree and Mr Bircham was trying to get 
round it when he got stuck in a drift.

‘He was trying to clear the snow from 
under his back wheels to reverse out and go back down the lane. As usual
he was doing his utmost to make sure the post got through.’

Last night, Mr Bircham’s widow, Wendy, was being comforted by the couple’s two sons. She was said to be too upset to talk.’

Brian Edworthy, Mr Bircham’s brother-in-law, said: ‘She would like to be left alone at this difficult time.’

Another family source added yesterday: ‘At the moment it is still not clear why John died. We are awaiting the results of a post mortem and for the body to be released.

‘Until then we won’t know what the precise cause of death was. We are assuming it was probably some sort of heart attack but we are not sure and we really don’t know if it was due to the circumstances he found himself in with his van.

‘John was stuck in the snow and had been digging around but the farmer who went to his aid didn’t report him being red faced and sweating or puffing and panting or anything like that.

‘He offered to pull John out after he had only been digging for a short while but before he could climb back into the driver’s seat to be towed out he just slid down the wing of the car and onto the ground.

‘The farmer attempted to resuscitate him together with another farm worker who came out but when the worker checked they could not seem to get any pulse. When the paramedics arrived it was the same. It was too late.’
