The mother of a teenage girl who was taped to a tree and sexually assaulted has launched an anti-bullying campaign after her daughter attempted suicide.

The Adelaide high school student, known as 'Sarah', was tied to a tree and sexually assaulted by a group of boys on school grounds in 2011.

The female Year Nine student at the unidentified site was allegedly filmed on the perpetrators' mobile phones screaming as eight fellow students pulled down their pants and rubbed their genitalia on her.

The incident occurred in 2011 but it was not reported to the Education Department or South Australian police until April this year, a department spokeswoman said. 

'I didn’t tell anyone about this for a long time because I thought it was my fault,' Sarah told A Current Affair.

'But I didn’t agree to when the boys came over. It was front of whole school yard, so about 20 people would have been watching it,' she said. 'They were all just watching waiting for it to happen.'

Pictures of the incident were posted online, adding to Sarah's humiliation. 

'It made me feel the exact way I did when it was happening to me. I felt disgusted with myself. I thought how stupid I looked and how ugly I looked.'

Sarah's mother Julie said that she noticed her daughter becoming withdrawn, and that she had constant headaches and had started skipping class.

Sarah eventually dropped out of school altogether, and only revealed to her mother the reason why in April of 2014. 

Sarah's mother Julie immediately contacted the school, the Department of Education and filed a police report to take action on behalf of her daughter.

While Sarah tried to swear her mother to silence, Julie explained to her that the only way to stop her attackers from acting again was to teach them that their behaviour was unacceptable.

'I said to her, I cant let these people do this to you. If we do nothing they’ll continue to do this. They’ll grow up to be domestic violence perpertrators, or bullies in the workplace, because they're not going to be held accountable by anyone.'

Julie was outraged that the incident had occurred in full view of other students, and within sight of the teachers lounge, and yet no one had intervened to help her daughter. 

'To think that she wasn't protected by adults,' Julie said.

Police investigating the incident found that the most the perpetrators could be charged with was offensive behaviour, and that too much time had passed to take action. 

Senior Constable Mick Abbott told the Daily Mail in July that the matter was an ongoing police inquiry and he could not comment.

'It's been ongoing investigation with the Education Department as well,' 

After filing the police report, the family experience backlash, with their house and car egged several times, and Julie's car window smashed in with a brick.

'It made me feel the exact way I did when it was happening to me. I felt disgusted with myself. I thought how stupid I looked and how ugly I looked,' said Sarah

'I said to her, I cant let these people do this to you. If we do nothing they’ll continue to do this,' said Julie

Julie has now started an anti-bullying social media campaign to raise awareness for the impact of the behaviour, to prevent what has happened to her daughter from occurring in other schools.

The angry responses the family received, including Sarah's Instagram account being hacked, pushed her to attempt to take her own life.

'I really felt that life was not at all going to change, and that it was only going to get worse,' she said.

'I thought, I can't do this anymore, I don’t want to be here anymore. I thought that (suicide) was the best option.' 

Sarah said that she feels lucky to have the support of her family, and has resumed her education at a different school.

'I don’t want to feel that way again. I want to have a good life,' she said.

'The biggest problem we have is kids not being able to speak up in a safe environment,' she said. 

'Awareness is the biggest thing in schools.' 

An Education Department spokeswoman said that the school was reviewing its bullying and harassment policies and procedures, and had reinforced its practices with staff and students. 

The spokeswoman added that the girl's mother has requested that the Education Department's initial focus be on her daughter's education and wellbeing needs.

'While the student had already left the school concerned when the incident was disclosed, counselling was made available to her from the school's counsellor, and this support continues at her new school,' she said.
