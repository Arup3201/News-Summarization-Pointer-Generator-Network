Vice President Joe Biden congratulated the wrong Marty Walsh after the Boston mayoral elections

When Marty Walsh won the Boston mayor's race, Vice President Joe Biden was quick to pick up the phone to congratulate him.

But, there was a problem.

The Marty Walsh who Biden had on the other end of the phone wasn't the Marty Walsh who had been elected to succeed longtime Boston Mayor Thomas Menino.

It was in fact a former aide to the late U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy also of the same name.

Before he could explain the mix-up, Biden launched into his congratulations, saying 'Marty, you did it, you son of a gun.'

Walsh,
 who said he has received misplaced calls for the other Marty Walsh in 
the past, said he quickly set Biden straight and passed over the telephone number for the elected mayor.

Walsh said Biden then jokingly congratulated him for not being mayor.

According to The Telegraph, Mr Walsh had
 three more calls during the night including one from the White House 
but the mix-up was already explained before the President was put through to him.

He also had voicemails left for him from Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Congresswoman who is head of the Democratic National Committee and RT Rybak, the mayor of Minneapolis, who is also head of the Democratic mayors' group.

Biden's niece has been recently making headlines when she allegedly told police officers 'you don't know who I am' when she was arrested following a fight with her roommate which landed her in jail.

The 26-year-old was arrested at her luxury apartment in Tribeca, New York, on September 17 after she allegedly went mad at her roommate over unpaid rent.

Friends of the young woman revealed after that she had begun to 'unravel' as a result of the pressure of being related to the Vice President.
