A Swiss museum has said it will accept a priceless collection of artworks bequeathed to it by a German collector despite some of it being Nazi plunder. 

The hoard, which includes masterpieces by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Claude Monet and others, was left to The Kunstmuseum, in Bern, by Cornelius Gurlitt upon his death, aged 81, in May.

He inherited the collection from his father, Hildebrand, one of Hitler's four official  art dealers responsible for trading in artworks pillaged from Jewish families across the Third Reich.

Returned: Kunstmuseum Bern (pictured) will accept the collection, but said it would work to ensure that any art looted from Jewish owners by the Nazis is returned

The collection of 1,280 items was only unearthed at Gurlitt's Munich apartment in 2012 during a police raid intended to expose tax fraud after the ageing recluse was stopped carrying a briefcase stuffed with thousands of euros in cash.

However, the museum's president, Christoph Schaeublin, told reporters in Berlin today that it would only accept the collection on the grounds that efforts are made to return any art looted from Jewish collectors to its rightful owners.

Before his death, Gurlitt reached a deal with the German government to check whether any of the works were indeed looted. Authorities say that deal is binding on any heirs.

One of Gurlitt's cousins has also filed claim, which a Munich court said today would have to be sorted out before the collection goes anywhere. 

A number of works, including those by Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall, were discovered during the probe, launched after Gurlitt was stopped by customs officers carrying €9,000 (£7,500) in a briefcase on a train heading out of Switzerland.

Since he was unemployed and with no obvious means of income, prosecutors obtained a warrant to search his small flat in Schwabing, Munich, upon which police found more than a thousand pieces of art, with an estimated value of up to €50 million.

Then, in July 2014 two sculptures were discovered in Gurlitt's home that experts believe could be works by Rodin and Degas.

And in September a painting by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase belonging to Gurlitt.

During World War II, the Nazis went on a looting rampage, destroying and stealing an estimated 750,000 pieces of European art.

The years between 1933 and 1945 are a black hole in the art community, with thousands of pieces of art changing hands and going missing. Much of it has never been found.

The Nazis took so-called degenerate art - mostly avant-garde modern art, such as expressionism - from museums and public institutions because it was deemed a corrupting influence on the German people. 

Masterpiece: This painting by German artist Max Liebermann, called 'Two Horsemen at the Beach', has been valued at between  £6 and 8 million

Unknown: An artwork by the German artist Otto Dix (left) and a formerly unknown picture by German artist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner entitled "Melancholic Girl' (right) are also part of the hoard

Stolen: Hans von Marees’ Die Labung masterpiece  once belonged to the Jewish industrialist Max Silberberg, who was forced to sell it by the Nazis. Mr Silberberg and his wife were later both murdered at Auschwitz

Hitler emplyed a team of four art dealers - including Hildebrand Gurlitt - to buy looted art for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell under duress during the Third Reich.

The dealers, who answered directly to Hitler's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, then marketed the pillaged art to buyers abroad, funnelling profits into the Nazi war chest.

After the war, a vast portion of this loot was discovered by the 'Monuments Men' section of the US Army, tasked with finding the stolen art of Europe and restoring it to its rightful owners. 

The Monuments Men moved into the Bavarian village of Aschbach in Bavaria in April 1945 and arrested the local Nazi party leader Baron Gerhard von Pölnitz who lived in the local castle along with art dealer Karl Haberstock and Hildebrand Gurlitt.

A note from a Monuments Men team member found in an archive detailed the astonishing artworks found in the castle: 'Rooms containing paintings, tapestries, statues, valuable furniture and documents from the belongings of two notorious German art dealers were found in the castle.' 

The flat: Since Gurlitt was unemployed and with no obvious means of income, prosecutors obtained a warrant to search his small flat in Schwabing, Munich, upon which police found more than a thousand pieces of art, with an estimated value of up to €50 million

Towards the end of the WWII, soldiers began stumbling upon treasure troves of stolen art, including this one in a salt mine at Merkers, Germany, which is being inspected by American General Dwight D Eisenhower

Another reads: 'A large room on the upper floor with 34 boxes, two packages containing carpets, eight packages of books … one room on the ground floor containing an additional 13 boxes owned by Mr Gurlitt. Most of these boxes contained pictures and drawings.'

Gurlitt, they wrote, was 'an art collector from Hamburg with connections within high-level Nazi circles. He acted on behalf of other Nazi officials and made many trips to France, from where he brought home art collections. There is reason to believe that these private art collections consist of looted art from other countries.' 

Gurlitt was described as an 'art dealer to the Führer.'

But during interrogation, Gurlitt claimed all the art he still possessed had been destroyed in his home during the allied bombing of Dresden. It was a lie he took to his grave in 1956.

Cornelius Gurlitt, who would go on to inherit many of these treasures, was 12 when his father was arrested and living in the castle. Hildebrand was quizzed by the Americans in June 1945 and they noted he seemed 'extremely nervous' as if he was not telling them the truth. 

Still missing: Many of the works, hidden across Europe, are still missing

Monuments Men, written and directed by Hollywood star George Clooney and starring Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett, tells the story of the recovery of stolen paintings which had been plundered by the Nazis during WWII

The MFAA involved around men and women from 17 nations. It was led by the Americans, but Britain provided the second-largest group of volunteers.

The story was turned into the 2014 film, Monuments Men,  written and directed by Hollywood star George Clooney and starring Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett.
