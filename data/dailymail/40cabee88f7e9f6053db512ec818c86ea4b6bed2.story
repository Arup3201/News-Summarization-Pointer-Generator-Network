A 77-year-old man has shot dead his terminally ill wife in a suspected mercy killing, police say.

An arrest warrant has been issued for Alvin Adams after his wife Jean Carol Adams, also 77, was killed at their home in Waco, Texas, where she was receiving hospice care for leukemia.

She was pronounced dead at the scene after police and medical officers arrived at the home and Alvin Adams was taken for a medical evaluation.

An arrest warrant has now been issued for Alvin Adams, her 77-year-old husband

An arrest warrant charging him with murder has now been issued by District Court judge Ralph Strother.

Waco police spokesman Steve Anderson said they were continuing to investigate, but added that Adams, 'seeing her in so much pain and suffering, put her out of her misery', The Waco Tribune reported.

Earlier yesterday he said: 'We will be considering a combination of things - what his physical condition is and what his mental condition is - and if charging him right now with murder for shooting his wife is in the best interest.'

Adams had suffered a stroke last year and had difficulty communicating, according to a neighbour.

It comes just three months after a 90-year-old Ohio man was sentenced to four years in prison for killing his childhood sweetheart wife of 65 years.

Robert Shaw, from the Cleveland suburb of Avon, was originally charged with aggravated murder for smothering his 84-year-old wife, Virginia, in November 2008.

He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in June as part of a plea deal - for which he may be eligible for early release after serving six months.

Shaw’s defense was that the death of his wife was a mercy killing to end the suffering she was enduring because of her many medical problems, which had caused her to be in and out of the hospital in the months leading up to her death.
