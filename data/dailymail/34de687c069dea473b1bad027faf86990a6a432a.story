A top fashion designer has been slammed by a broadcasting watchdog after he praised young Irishmen for 'damaging English virgins'.

Paul Costelloe - whose designs are sold in House of Fraser and John Lewis - provoked outrage with the remarks about Irish emigrants in London, where he lives.

'The English, they love us and they hate us, you know, you just have to put up with that,' he told a live radio show in his native Ireland.

Anger: Irish-born Paul Costelloe, pictured on the catwalk at London Fashion Week with two models, told a radio show young Irish emigrants to England 'are doing great and damaging a lot of young English virgins'

Challenged: The RTÉ presenter asked Mr Costelloe (pictured with former Miss World Rosanna Davison) if he was a chauvinist, which he denied. But the Irish radio watchdog said the broadcaster could have done more

'Certainly
 the Irish are never short of chatting up and, you know, we have that 
skill and I’m sure these young guys are doing great and damaging a lot 
of young English virgins, so there you are, and good luck to them.'

Presenter George Lee questioned whether the designer was a 'chauvinist' - which he denied.

It was then alleged a text message to the show complaining about Mr Costelloe was 'laughed off'.

Born in Limerick, the designer built his empire from wealthy Knightsbridge in west London

The comments on RTÉ's The Business show in February drew two official complaints to the broadcaster, one of which was elevated to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

The upset listener, Barbara Smith, branded the remarks repugnant and dangerous to women.

RTÉ agreed a number of listeners were 
offended by the comments, but said they could be 
construed as a flamboyant and heavy-handed description of young Irish 
men living in London.

The broadcaster insisted it was a throwaway remark during a 'fast-moving' live programme
 on a side issue to the main thrust of the interview.

But the watchdog disagreed, saying the show could have used a delay button or used the presenter to deal with on-air risks.

The watchdog's ruling said: 'It
 was the opinion of the committee, following its review of the material,
 that the manner in which sexual relationships were described by the 
guest would cause undue offence and that the programme makers had not 
taken due care in the way in which the comments were handled during the 
programme.

'In
 particular, it was the view of the committee that the presenter’s tone 
and his answer to his own question in respect of whether his guest had 
displayed chauvinism did not display due care in respect of the 
sensitivity of listeners who, in the opinion of the committee, might 
reasonably view the comment as offensive.'

Born in Limerick, the designer has been at the helm
 of British high street fashion for decades and established his brand at
 a flagship store in Knightsbridge, west London.

In 2010 he was picked as one of six Irish fashion designers to be honoured on a postage stamp.

An
 RTÉ spokesman told MailOnline: 'To the best of our knowledge there were
 two complaints sent in relating to the Paul Costello interview.

'We have no further comment to make in relation to the BAI decision which we accept.

'The full statement of the BAI decision will be broadcast shortly before The Business programme starts tomorrow morning.'
