But Williams goes into the tournament at the centre of a storm after Russian tennis federation president Shamil Tarpischev was fined and suspended from any involvement with the WTA for a year following derogatory comments about Serena and her sister Venus.

Tarpischev, who is also the Russian Davis and Fed Cup captain and a member of the International Olympic Committee, referred to world number one Serena and Venus as 'the Williams brothers' on Russian television.

Stacey Allaster, chairman and CEO of the WTA, announced Tarpischev had been fined the maximum of 25,000 US dollars (over £15,500), while the WTA is also seeking his removal from his position as chairman of the board of the Kremlin Cup for a year.

This year's edition of the joint WTA and ATP tournament is being held in Moscow this week.

Allaster revealed Tarpischev had written a private letter of acknowledgement but called for him to apologise both in public and personally to the Williams sisters.

Allaster said in a statement: 'The statements made by Shamil Tarpischev on Russian television with respect to two of the greatest athletes in the history of women's tennis are insulting, demeaning and have absolutely no place in our sport.

'Serena Williams and Venus Williams are champions on and off the court - outstanding human beings, incredible sportswomen and amazing role models who have done so much to inspire women and girls around the world to achieve their dreams.

'The WTA was founded on the principles of equality, opportunity and respect, and Venus and Serena embody all of these attributes.

'Mr Tarpischev's statement questioning their gender tarnishes our great game and two of our champions. His derogatory remarks deserve to be condemned and he will be sanctioned.

'Mr Tarpischev's private letter of acknowledgement is a start. However, Mr Tarpischev owes Venus and Serena Williams a personal apology, as well as other players and tennis fans everywhere, a public apology.'

Dave Haggerty, the president, chairman and CEO of the United States Tennis Association, also issued a statement calling on Tarpischev to apologise.

He said: 'As the president of the USTA and a member of the board of directors of the International Tennis Federation, I call on Shamil Tarpischev to issue a formal apology to Venus and Serena Williams.

'As the president of the Russian Tennis Federation and a member of the International Olympic Committee, Mr Tarpischev is expected to conduct himself with the highest degree of integrity and sportsmanship.

'Unfortunately, his comments do not embody either of these traits and in fact were reprehensible.'

Tarpischev, who made the comments on a chat show, is reported to have claimed his words were intended as a joke.
