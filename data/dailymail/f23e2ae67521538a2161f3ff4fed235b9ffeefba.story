A grieving widow has told of her horror after ambulance staff threw her out of the vehicle transporting her dying husband to hospital after he was involved in a skiing accident.

Dana Morse, from Kingston, Canada, was holidaying in the popular Sugarloaf ski resort in Maine, in the northeastern region of the U.S., when her spouse David lost control before crashing into a tree.

Mrs Morse had initially sat in the front of the ambulance as it drove to the hospital, but after pleading with staff to sit in the back alongside Mr Morse, she was stunned when the driver pulled over and let her out.

Tragic: David Morse, an experienced skier,died after crashing into a tree at Sugarloaf Ski Resort Maine

Mrs Morse said: 'He left me on the side of the road in a snowstorm, with me then chasing the ambulance screaming my head off to stop.

'Here I am, looking like a freaking lunatic, pulling cars over to ask them to help me.'

Mrs Morse, a nurse practitioner, complained that paramedics overlooked her husband's internal bleeding, multiple chest injuries and abdominal pain following his collision that eventually saw him suffer respiratory arrest.

She intervened, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her own 
husband, before staff eventually started an IV drip.

Then as they drove to the emergency department, Mrs Morse was thrown out after requesting to sit by her husband.

She added: '(I said) he is dying and I know he is dying and cannot live with myself if I am not holding his hand. I can’t explain to my boys — they are 11 and 14 — I cannot explain to them that I wasn’t with their father when he died.'

Fatal: Mr Morse suffered multiple chest injuries and internal bleeding

Mr Morse, 41, an experienced skier is believed to have died in the ambulance on route to the hospital.

However, an official at Franklin Memorial has denied Mrs Morse's claims, insisting no complaint has been lodged by the widow.

Ralph Johnson, chief information officer noted that an investigation had been launched into the conduct of NorthStar Ambulance staff.

Yet he added that ambulance director David Robie, was also unaware of the allegations made against his paramedics.

The Morse family had been on a vacation at the resort for a week prior to Mr Morse's fatal crash.
