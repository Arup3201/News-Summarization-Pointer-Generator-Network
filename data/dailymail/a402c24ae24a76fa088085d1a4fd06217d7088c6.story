Cheating death: Professional diver Chris Lemons

A deep sea diver cheated death when he survived under water for almost 40 minutes after his air supply ran out.

Chris Lemons was working 262 feet under water in the freezing North Sea when his lifeline of air and heat was severed, leaving him with just his oxygen tank.

The professional diver remained perfectly still to conserve his energy but lost consciousness when the air supply from his emergency oxygen tank ran out.

He was not discovered until 38 minutes later when his colleagues dragged him to safety of a diving bell.

His workmates feared the worst when they pulled his blue, lifeless and freezing cold body on board.

However - astonishingly - he regained
 consciousness after only two breaths of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation 
and has since made a full recovery, The Times reported.

The 32-year-old's amazing story 
survival has stunned the diving community, who have praised his 
remarkably calm actions in internet chat rooms.

According to The Times, a fellow diver wrote in an online forum: 'Chris, the diver in 
question, said he knew to try and conserve his gas even though he was 
freezing to death. He doesn't remember slipping into unconsciousness, it
 just happened.

'After 
two breaths by the bellman he started breathing on his own, he even 
stood up and out the way on his own steam to help in getting the bottom 
door down.

'Once his 
breathing was restored he recovered quite quickly, so they proceeded to 
start and warm him once the door was down and the bell was on its way 
up. (He was blue when they removed his hat).

'Chris has been very very very lucky. It brings it home just how quickly things can go pear-shaped.'

The
 drama unfolded last Tuesday when Mr Lemons, from Mallaig in the 
Scottish Highlands, made his underwater descent attached to a support 
vessel belonging to his employers, Bibby Offshore.

He
 had been inspecting a rig drilling structure at the Huntington oil 
field, 115 miles 
east of Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, when his 'umbilical cord' lifeline of 
air and heat - crucial for working in very cold water - was snagged and 
severed at 10.10pm.

Two minutes later all communication was lost with Mr Lemons as his main oxygen supply was cut off, leaving with his emergency tank which, experts believe, would have given him 10 minutes of air at the most.

While another 
diver made it to the safety of a diving bell, an air-tight chamber used to transport divers to underwater depths, Mr Lemons displayed 
extraordinary calm and followed safety procedure by sitting very still 
on top of the oil rig drill and using his emergency oxygen tank while he
 waited for help to arrive.

By 10.17pm, the diver's beacon - a 
safety signal - was located in the spot where Mr Lemons had been working
 on the drill and a remotely operated search vehicle is launched.

The other diver retrieved Mr Lemon's 
body and pulled him to the diving bell. When colleagues removed his 
helmet he was unconscious, blue and very cold.

However,
 after only two resuscitating breaths from the bellman - the name given 
to the diver on the diving bell - he regained consciousness.

He eventually re-surfaced at 10.48pm, where he was immediately transported to receive decompression care.

After undergoing treatment in a decompression chamber in Aberdeen, Mr Lemons has since made a complete recovery.

 was attached to, praised the 'skill, professionalism and expertise' of 
the rescue crew.

A diving medical expert today claimed the cold temperatures of the North Sea might have helped save Chris Lemons.

The freezing water could have activated his diving reflex which would have slowed his heart and 
optimised his respiration while under water.

Oliver Firth, medical director of the
 London Diving Chamber, said: 'It's staggering that he survived. He 
should be dead at that sort of depth.

'It's incredible that he had the 
presence of mind to stay calm and not try and get to the surface in a 
panic, as panicking leads to death in this sort of instance.

'The interesting thing here is that 
it happened in very cold water. It sounds like the diving reflex might 
have played a part in this.

'When very cold water touches 
our faces, the reflex is activated and it's 
designed to protect our bodies by slowing the heart down 
and optimising respiration while under water.

'Animals have it too, but it's much 
stronger, which is why seals and other mammals can stay under water for 
long periods of time.

'If his umbilical cord was severed, I
 assume his helmet would have filled with water which might have hit 
chemical receptors on certain areas of the face, such as the forehead. 
This might have activated the reflex. It's a protective response.

'He would have had maybe 10 litres of
 air in his emergency oxygen tank which, at that depth, would not have 
lasted very long - maybe eight to 10 minutes.

'This is one of the most remarkable stories I have heard, not only because of his survival but his rapid recovery.'
