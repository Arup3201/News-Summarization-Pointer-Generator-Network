A primary school has come under fire for insisting children fasting during Ramadan go home for a rest because of health and safety fears.

Newport Primary School sent a letter home to parents saying pupils observing fast during the Muslim holy month must be picked up at lunch time so they can have a break.

However, after a number of parents complained that work commitments meant they could not pick their child up during the day, the school in Leyton, East London, reversed the decision.

The school has said it was unavailable for comment but Waltham Forest Council said it was issued with advice from Public Health England, which the safety body deny.

A spokesperson from Public Health England said: 'We have not issued any advice on Ramadan to this school or others.

'What we have done is issue in May our heatwave plan. However we are not in a heatwave at the moment.

'The council seemed to have linked to this because it contains some info around fasting, which does not advise fasting students to be sent home.'

Ramadan is set to last until July 27.
