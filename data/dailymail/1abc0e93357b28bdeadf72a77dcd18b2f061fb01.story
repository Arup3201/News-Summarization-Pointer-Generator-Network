One of Britain's finest country estates which comes with its own world-class horse racing stables has gone on the market for £26 million.

The 2,000-acre Manton estate, which belonged to flamboyant horse racing magnate Robert Edmund Sangster, boasts a 200-year-old manor house and its own hamlet of 24 cottages and 10 flats, all set in sprawling countryside.

But its most impressive feature is its state-of-the-art race horse training centre made up of five separate yards, seven gallops and 220 horse boxes.

The successful stables have turned out 50 Classics winners over their 150 year history, ten of which under the stewardship of current owners the Sangster family.

Businessman-turned-racehorse breeder Robert Sangster bought Manton in 1984 for £10 million and it was the centre of his operations until his death in 2004.

His sons Guy and Ben own the estate, near Marlborough, Wilts, which is currently home to leading racehorse trainers Brian Meehan and George Baker.

The 
Sangster family are now selling the historic estate, built in the 1860s,
 after 30 years of ownership for offers in excess of £26 million.

It
 is being offered as a whole or broken up to seven lots. It also comes 
with 1,600 acres of farmland and an well-regarded pheasant and partridge
 shoot.

It is reported to be attracting interest from international parties in the Middle East and China.

Robert and his third and final wife Susan Sangster in 1994

Robert Edmund Sangster was born in 1936, in Liverpool and was the son of Vernon Sangster, who started the Vernons Pools business in 1926 with £400  - in 1988 his son sold the Vernons Pools empire for £90 million.

After entering the world of horse racing at 28, Sangster changed the face of thoroughbred racing in the Seventies, going on to win the Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe twice.

He helped create a global bloodstock brand with the Coolmore Stud and at the height of his success he had around 1,000 horses at stud and in training across the world.

His famous blue, green and white silks won more than 100 Group One races, including two Derbies with The Minstrel (1977) and Golden Fleece (1982).

Sadler's Wells, one of the most successful ever stallions, was bred at Sangster's Swettenham Stud.

He dated a string of beautiful women including supermodel Jerry Hall in 1982

He also had a colourful private life and was married three times.

He dated a string of beautiful women including supermodel Jerry Hall in 1982 and author Tara Moss, and later married Melbourne socialite Susan Renouf.

His 15-year marriage to Susan, his third wife, was often the subject of gossip columns and Sangster was known for lavishing gifts on his wife.

When Susan admitted she couldn’t cook, he bought her a restaurant.

When she divorced him in 2000 she received a settlement of £15 million - Sangster's wealth was believed to run into the hundreds of millions of pounds.

He had five sons and a daughter from his three marriages.

The flamboyant horse racing magnate died aged 67 after a long battle with cancer in 2004 - he spent most of his latter years in Australia and Barbados.

Since his death, a number of his assets have been disposed of, including the sale of £20 million Jane's Harbour, his luxury Caribbean hideaway in Barbados, and properties in Holland Park and Marbella.

The
 business employs 100 staff and it is not known if the new owners would 
keep the business as it is or bring in their own employees.

The Manton estate first came to prominence under the legendary horse trainer Alec Taylor who started there in the 1870s.

Matthew Sudlow, from estate agents Strutt and Parker, said: 'Manton really is one of the finest estates in the country.

'It is totally unique - there is nothing like it on the market and hasn't been for the past decade.

Robert Sangster made his money out of Vernons football pools which he sold in 1998 for £90 million.

In
 a statement, Guy and Ben Sangster, said: 'While it is sad that the 
family are selling Manton after 30 years of ownership, we are all in 
agreement that now is the time for another chapter in the illustrious 
history of this estate.

'We remain committed to racing and breeding and the Sangster colours will still be seen on the race track.'
