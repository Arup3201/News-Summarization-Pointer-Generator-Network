Olympic gold medalist Lindsey Vonn is joining the Today show as a correspondent for the Sochi Winter Games after she was forced to bow out of the competition due to an ongoing knee injury.

The alpine skier is set to report daily in the U.S. on the early morning show and provide additional coverage for NBC Sports.

Vonn, 29, appeared on the Today show on Tuesday from her home in Pensacola, Florida, with her new rescue dog Leo to discuss her recovery from a recent knee operation and her painful decision to skip Sochi.

Vonn, who has been dating golfer Tiger Woods since last year, had a second surgery on her busted right knee earlier this month.

She said: 'I feel okay, I've been through this once before so I know the drill. It's a bit complicated because it's pretty major surgery but I've been doing therapy and I'm alright.'

The athlete was asked by Today show presenter Matt Lauer if she had the strength to go through another round of training and rehabilitation to return to competition level.  

Vonn said: 'I can do it. After 
making the decision not to commit in Sochi, I've made the commitment to 
race through to the next Olympics. I felt a bit rushed for Sochi but I'm going to be racing next year and the year after that and the year after that.'

The Olympic skier said it was difficult to watch Team USA heading for Sochi and gearing up for the games.

With
 tears in her eyes, she told the Today show: 'It's going to be hard to 
watch, it's already hard, you guys run commercials every two minutes.

Vonn put herself through a grueling, and often painful, rehab and training program after knee surgery last year but was forced to bow out of the Sochi Games because she was not ready to compete

'It will be hard to watch the alpine events, I always watch the figure skating and the luge but it's hard to watch the alpine.'

However the champion skier was excited about her new challenge as a TV presenter but added: 'I'm not looking forward to waking up this early.'

Vonn revealed on January 7 that despite undergoing major surgery to repair her anterior cruciate ligaments 11 months ago, the same injury had once again flared up.

In a statement, she said: 'I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level.

Lindsey Vonn competes during the Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup Women's Downhill in December in Val d'Isere, France. An ongoing knee problem, however, left her unable to compete at an Olympic level

'I'm having surgery soon so that I can be ready for the World Championships at home in Vail next February. On a positive note, this means there will be an additional spot so that one of my teammates can go for gold.

'Thank you all so much for all of the love and support. I will be cheering for all of the Olympians and especially team USA!' she added.

Vonn adopted her dog Leo - who also has a bad knee - on the same day she revealed she would be pulling out of February's Olympic Games in Sochi.
