You could say their garden is a bit of a jungle... in the nicest possible way, of course.

For as they spend up to 12 hours a day between them tending their precious plot, pensioners Alan and Mary Watson could never be accused of letting it get overgrown.

With 18ft windmill palms native to the Far East towering into the sky, tree ferns from Australia, cordylines and fig trees, it does, however, look like it ought to be sited somewhere tropical.

Garden of Eden: Alan and Mary Watson have spent £10,000 on tropical plants to create a paradise in their back yard

You might need a bigger watering can: The plants and 18ft palm trees require constant attention and keep the retired couple busy for up to 12 hours a day

Or at Kew Gardens or as an exhibit at the Chelsea Flower Show, at the very least.

But in fact this little piece of paradise has far, far humbler roots. To reach it, you just have to step out of the back door of Mr and Mrs Watson’s red-brick detached house in the suburbs of Derby.

It is a far cry from what was there when the couple bought the newly built three-bedroom property in a residential street in 1966 for £3,150 and moved in after their wedding.

Back then, the most eye-catching site in the 750sq yard back garden was the clothes drying on the washing line.

But they immediately set about transforming the patch of scrub - and right away were so dedicated to the garden that at the start of their marriage they had no stair carpet because they preferred to spend their money on a greenhouse instead.

Mrs Watson, 67, a former care worker, said: ‘I had to scrub the stairs on my hands and knees for two years, but I had beautiful tomatoes on the table.’

They first transformed it into a typical English suburban garden. Mr Watson, who worked as a British Rail engineer, grew dahlias and picked up countless rosettes for his vegetables at horticultural shows.

It was 15 years ago that, having raised their son Adam and become grandparents, they decided to switch to the tropical paradise look.

Then and now: The sparse garden's main feature was a humble clothes line when the couple bought the property 46 years ago (left). They have transformed it into a spectacular paradise (right)

Mr Watson, 73, designed it himself and since then they have spent an estimated £10,000 stocking it with its fabulous foliage.

Neither of them has ever actually visited a tropical country, so Mr Watson relied on his imagination to plan the lush haven.

Dazzling red Bishop of Llandaff dahlias remain as a reminder of the more traditional style, and there is also a fish pond, a waterfall, a lion head fountain and a decking area in the south-facing garden.

‘Alan’s hip had started to play him up so we decided to create a different garden, one with less digging and less work. At least that’s what we thought then - but I’m not so sure now,’ said Mrs Watson.

‘We can do up to six hours each a day quite easily. Alan is head gardener and I’m his deputy. You soon know if you miss a day - it quickly shows.’ While the results of their efforts are gloriously plain to see, their own little ‘Eden project’ has not been without its hiccups.

To their dismay, the severe winter of 2010 ravaged many of their prized tropical plants and they lost several, including 6ft tree ferns, to the cold weather.

Unassuming: The couple bought their home in Derby in 1966, when they designed their garden in the traditional style. They were so keen on the pastime, they went without carpet for their stairs so they could afford a greenhouse

They were so upset that at times, they say, they wondered if they could carry on. But they have replaced plants and restored the garden to its lush former glory once more.

They now take extra care to protect the plants in winter and have picked up some unusual tips, including wrapping duvets around tree trunks to keep them warm when the mercury plunges.

So what motivates them to do it? ‘What this garden does to people, you can see it in their faces. It blows them away. It’s a stunning and tranquil place,’ said Mrs Watson.

Mr Watson added: ‘It takes you on a journey. A garden is the journey of your life.’
