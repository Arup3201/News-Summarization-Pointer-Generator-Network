The family of a surfer who had his hand and part of his arm torn off in a shark attack have launched an appeal to help fund his long road to recovery.

Sean Pollard is now in a stable condition at the Royal Perth hospital after he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay, east of Esperance on Western Australia's south coast on Thursday.

A Facebook page has been set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Sean's recovery and rehabilitation.

Sean Pollard's family have launched an appeal for his long road to recovery

Department of Fisheries examinations have revealed that the bite marks on Sean Pollard's surfboard would indicate a Great White shark was responsible for the attack 

A facebook page has been set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Sean Pollard's recovery and rehabilitation after he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay on WA's south coast on Thursday

It read, 'Upon the attack he(Sean Pollard) was airlifted to RPH in Perth by the Royal Flying Doctors for further medical treatment.'

'The time ahead will be one of many challenges and he will be needing plenty of support & assistance. To assist Sean & his family, donations either small or large will be greatly appreciated.'

The appeal comes as WA fisheries have revealed bite marks on the 23 year old's surfboard, indicate a Great White shark was responsible for his injuries.

The two white sharks that were killed by fisheries officers following the incident were taken to Perth for examination by the department's experts.

Department of Fisheries' principal shark scientist Dr. Rory McAuley said those examinations were unable to confirm whether either shark was involved in the incident. 

He said while results were inconclusive, it was not uncommon for sharks to disgorge their stomach contents when they were caught. 

'We have also examined the surfboard used by the man involved in the incident on Thursday and indications are that a white shark was responsible for the injuries he received,' he said.

Sean Pollard was flown to Perth by the Royal Flying Doctor Service within hours of the attack on Thursday which is believed to have been caused by a Great White shark

Examinations by Fisheries scientists have revealed that the bite on Sean's surfboard was caused by a Great White shark 

'Jaw measurements will also help with future bite investigations. The first white shark caught is 3.46 metres long; the second white shark is 2.68 metres in length.'

An online appeal to help in Sean's recovery has also been launched and has already raised over $5000

'Our team has since collected samples from both sharks including sections of vertebrae, which will assist us with our research work.'

'Now that our investigation is complete, material will be made available to other research institutions,' said Dr. McAuley.

WA Premier Colin Barnett said it was necessary to kill the two white pointers because they posed an imminent threat to public safety.

'The threat is there and sadly (Thursday) just demonstrated how likely a shark attack can happen,' Mr Barnett said.  

'Perth beaches are probably as safe as we can reasonably make them (but) the south west and the southern coastline is a different matter.' 

It was the first time white pointers - a protected species - had been killed by WA officials.

Fisheries shark response unit manager Lisa Clack defended the move amid reports Mr Pollard might have been mauled by two bronze whalers, saying it was 'more likely' a white pointer was responsible.

Beaches in the Wylie Bay area have now been reopened and no new shark sightings or reports in the area have been made since the incident.

Caution signs at key access points will remain in place, while department vessels which have been on the water will remain on patrol.

A separate online appeal has also been launched on Indiegogo Fundraiser, encouraging everyone to give generously towards Sean's recovery.

Set up by Natalie Banks, founder of the No WA sharks culls campaign, it said,'Sean's medical assistance would not have been cheap at all! Let's show how much we really do care about people!'

'Every effort is being taken to get a hold of Sean's family in terms of this fundraiser, including calling Bunbury Police, South Bunbury Football Club and certain members of the media.' 

'I got involved because it's a tragic incident and because of my connections with family and those who have had shark attacks before, they need all the support they can get,' said Ms Banks. 

So far the appeal has raised well over its $1000 goal and is at more than $5000 with more than 100 people donating.

'Blown away by the support of the community.'

'So we've been speaking to Paul De Gelder (shark attack survivor) in Sydney to see if he'll speak to Sean, depends if Sean is willing,' she said.

'Assist (fundraising money) Paul to go from Sydney to Perth, the rest will go all to medical expenses involved in surgery he has had and the treatment he's going to need, including counselling for family.' 

The campaign will close on October 14. 

The sharks campaigner says the system has let Sean down and more needs to be done to educate people in what's happening at their popular beaches. 

'In Cape Town South Africa, there's a shark spotters program, flags and alerts, to alert people of shark activity.'

'We're not doing enough of this in WA. There needs to be a national view on this, I think, how can educating people harm the public,' said Ms Banks.

'Think government needs to do more for surfers and beach goers to have greater access to devices that are proven to work..., surf smart (electronic devices on surfboards), wet suits which deter sharks, these things should be available to the public at subsidised costs.'

'Why are these products not more accessible when our premier is talking public safety issues.'
