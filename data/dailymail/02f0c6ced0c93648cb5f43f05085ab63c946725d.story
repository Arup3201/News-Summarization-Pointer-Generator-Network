Shamed: One of the photos Conservative MP Brooks Newmark sent to a young single mother

Tory MP Brooks Newmark bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you' during a two year affair, it was claimed today.

The former minister, 56, a father of five, yesterday issued a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time.

Mr Newmark left his post as minister for civil society last month after he was exposed as having exchanged lewd photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous 20-year-old Tory PR woman. 

Today it emerged that he 'seduced' an unnamed mother on Facebook behind his wife's back, sending her up to forty naked selfies in the past year, his lover said.

According to The Sun one text read: 'I am desperate for sex with you — it's been too long. At least a pic would keep the demons at bay!'

Another said: 'We are good lovers and we are good friends but probably not both together'. 

It is alleged he also invited her to his Westminster office and to his home having offered to pay the rail fare.

His wife, innocently caught up in a humiliating sex scandal has moved out of their constituency  home in Essex, it has emerged.

He announced he would quit the Commons at the next election, adding that he had ‘traumatised’ his family with ‘bizarre and abhorrent’ behaviour.

He would be moving in to a psychiatric facility to battle his ‘demons’, he said. 

It has now emerged that he also sent a series of explicit ‘selfies’ to a single mother he met online. In one photograph he is seen posing naked while grinning in what appears to be a hotel bathroom.

She claims she did not know he was married because 'he's an MP, he's not going to lie'.

The single mother ended the relationship two weeks ago when it was revealed he had sent naked pictures to someone else.

She told The Sun's Paul Sims: 'He's told the world he was foolish and he engaged in late night flirtations online with other women because he was unwell. But that simply isn't true. We met in 2012 and he seduced me. 

'We had a full-on relationship for over two years. I was in love with him.'

Messages: His sexts to a reporter posing as a Tory activist forced him to resign his job

On the day he quit the Government he wrote: 'Something awful has happened. I can't talk now but have had to resign from Govt. I will catch up later. So sorry.' She replied she 'thought I was the only one for you'.

The following day he said he was in 'pain' but when his lover asked him if she could ever trust him he  he responded: 'Please stop thinking about yourself'.

Yesterday, Mr Newmark’s wife Lucy, 52, appeared to have moved from the family’s mansion near Braintree, Essex, to their £7million London home.

Mrs Newmark, the daughter of the military historian Sir John Keegan, was seen alone at the four-bedroom Belgravia townhouse yesterday.

As a result of his conduct, Mr Newmark wrote to the Prime Minister on Saturday evening announcing he is to quit in May at the General Election as he tries to rescue his family life.

‘I was the man who had everything. I made a fortune, married a beautiful wife, had five children, and then fulfilled my lifelong ambition to be a politician,’ he wrote in the Mail on Sunday.

‘Now my political career is in ruins. I have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues.

‘Many will regard me as a failure. And it is true: behind the outward facade of success and achievement, I have been battling demons – and losing to them. I craved adrenaline and risk. Stress at work drove me to increasingly erratic behaviour. My friends warned me that I was cracking up. I ignored them.’

American-born Mr Newmark confessed to ‘a series of flirtations’ with women on social media and said he has ‘no one to blame but myself and take full responsibility for my own actions’.

He added: ‘Deep inside, I knew I was playing with fire. Now it has consumed me and my family. I want to concentrate on slaying those demons – making me, I hope, a better husband and father.’

Mr Newmark was born in the United States and worked in finance before becoming MP for Braintree in 2005.

A fortnight ago, it emerged he had been exchanging explicit pictures online with someone he believed to be a young blonde Tory named Sophie. In fact, the profile had been created by a male freelance reporter.

The Sunday Mirror, which ran the original story, has been accused of entrapment – but it emerged that the pictures were among a number Mr Newmark had been sending.

The MP, who led David Cameron’s drive for greater representation of women in politics, also sent explicit photographs to a young single mother weeks after being appointed as a minister in July.

He allegedly sent more than a dozen pictures. A source told the Sun on Sunday: ‘He asked her to send an explicit picture back but she refused. The woman had no idea he was married and was horrified when she discovered the truth.’

Responding to the revelations, Mr Newmark said he has battled anorexia and depression. While his wife seems to have moved out of their home, he is having therapy to try to save his marriage.

‘I am seeking help now,’ he said. ‘I will be beginning residential psychiatric treatment for the next few weeks in the hope that professional help will enable me to salvage my life and my family.’

Mr Newmark, who will remain an MP for another seven months, will continue to claim his £67,060 parliamentary salary while in therapy. He said he was not seeking re-election despite advice from friends to ‘tough this out’.

He made it clear he did not blame the media for exposing his behaviour, saying: ‘The fault is mine alone’.

There was no answer yesterday at Mr Newmark’s five-bedroom mansion in the Essex countryside. At the couple’s second home in Belgravia, Mrs Newmark said: ‘I don’t want to talk to anyone, thank you very much.’
