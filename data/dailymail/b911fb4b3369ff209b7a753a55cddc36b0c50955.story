The Duchess of Cornwall doesn't want to become Queen because of the sensitivity connected with the memory of Princess Diana.

Camilla has instead made it clear she intends to be known as Princess Consort should Prince Charles outlive his mother and become King.

This is despite the fact that legally she will become Queen should Charles take the throne.Â 

Should Charles become King, Camilla would be legally entitled to call herself Queen. However, aware of the sensitivity around the memory of Princess Diana she has made clear she wishes to be known as Princess Consort

In the same way, senior royal sources
say Prince Charles's wife is technically the Princess of Wales, but 
chooses not to go by that title again because of the sensitivities associated 
with Diana.

A senior royal aide yesterday insisted the position is not set to change, telling the Daily Express: 'Legally, she will be Queen, but that doesn't mean she has to go by that title.

'In the same way, she is legally the Princess of Wales but she doesn't use that title because of the sensitivities.'

It is widely believed that Prince Charles does not want his wife to be remembered as being deprived of the title.

When Charles and Camilla married in 2005, the Royal Household said it was convention that the wife of a King was known as his Queen.

Despite her insistence, earlier this 
year Camilla did nothing to quash rumours she still wanted to be Queen 
when an eight-year-old girl asked her: 'Are you going to be Queen one 
day,' and she replied: 'You never know.'

A senior royal adviser told the Express:
'It will be up to the Government of the day to decide whether it thinks
legislation is needed.'

The Duchess has recently impressed many with her willingness to publicise good causes and engage with the public.

But it hasn't always been the case.

Hitting the dance floor: Charles and Camilla gamely showed their moves during the 'chapauringe' dance during a visit to the Old Fort in Stone Town, the capital of Zanzibar. The couple are visiting Tanzania on an eight-day Commonwealth tour

Camilla was extremely unpopular after she and Charles became
lovers in the 1980's while he was still married to Diana, the nation's 
sweetheart.

When asked to cite the cause of the 
marriage breakdown on BBC's Panorama, Diana responded 'Well there were 
three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded' referring to 
Camilla.

Charles later admitted to the affair on a television interview with Jonathan Dimbleby.

Camilla subsequently 
announced her divorce to husband Andrew Parker Bowles in 1995 and she 
and Charles resumed their relationship.

They were eventually engaged to be married in 2005.

Since marrying the Prince, Camilla has demonstrated ease in dealing with public appearances.

None
more apparent than yesterday, when she showed off a henna tattoo on her
hand during the couple's eight-day Commonwealth tour of Tanzania.

The
royal couple flew to the idyllic isle, which is a semi-autonomous part 
of the country, on a private jet from its commercial capital, Dar es 
Salaam.

Charles and Camilla even took part in a local dance during the visit, much to the delight of onlookers.

Charles swayed contentedly along to a tune played on a zumari, similar to the instrument snake-charmers use.

Camilla was hot on his heels though and, clutching her white parasol, she swayed her hips to the music, while a Zanzibari woman wrapped a yellow, red and black khanga shawl around her.

The couple then did an impromptu dance called the chapauringe in the searing heat within the walls of the Old Fort in Stone Town, the capital of Zanzibar.
