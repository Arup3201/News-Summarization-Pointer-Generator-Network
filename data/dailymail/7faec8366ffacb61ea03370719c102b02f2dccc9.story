A British schoolboy is today expected to become the youngest person to trek to the South Pole.

Sixteen-year-old Lewis Clarke  should arrive at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station at around 3pm GMT after a 700-mile trek from the coast.

Lewis, from Bristol, has spent 46 days in temperatures as low as -40C and winds of up to 60mph. He has skied an average eight hours and 18 miles a day, in aid of The Prince’s Trust.

Lewis, accompanied by experience polar guide Carl Alvey, has pulled his own supplies for the last 700 miles.

By reaching the South Pole he will beat the record for the youngest person to get there by two years.

The tough lad has spent the last 45 days braving temperatures as low as minus 40 C, and facing 120mph blizzards.

GCSE student Lewis, who spent Christmas with only Carl for company, has averaged around 80 miles a day in sub-zero conditions, in his bid to break three records.

Lewis began his epic journey on December 2, and is raising money for The Prince's Trust charity.

Lewis has been planning the expedition for three years and began a tough training regime a year ago, beginning with a two week polar training course in Norway.

Speaking during the Pole expedition, he said: ‘I used to love snow, hate hot places and hot weather, and wear shorts in the middle of winter. Now I'm not too sure.

‘I've been through the entire list of Polar problems. I knew it would be hard, but it's harder than I ever thought it would be.

‘I've suffered from blisters, a high-altitude cough, frost nip and I even managed to break a ski they told me was unbreakable.

‘I think sometimes about how few people have done this. Only 300 in 100 years. That's pretty cool.’

Proud dad Steven Clarke said: ‘He's doing something amazing, and I'm incredibly proud of him.

‘Each day is a nail biter. How far have they got? Has anything gone wrong? Will they make it? I'm ready for him to come home now.

‘Coming home will be a bit weird for him, But it'll be a few days off, a party, and onto GCSE revision.’

Lewis will beat three world records if he makes it to the South Pole today.

He will become the youngest to ski the full 700 miles, coast to pole, (Hercules Inlet route), beating Sarah Landry, of Canada, aged 18 in 2004.

He will also be the youngest to ski partial journey to the pole, 112 miles (flown to start), beating Amelia Hemplemann Adams, aged 16 in 2011, and the youngest man to ski short route (314 miles) from coast to pole, beating Parker Liataud, 19, in 2013
