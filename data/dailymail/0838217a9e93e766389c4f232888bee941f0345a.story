Manchester United run the risk of alienating the Class of ’92 for good with their ongoing prevarications over the make-up of Louis van Gaal’s backroom staff.

United have delayed the confirmation of Van Gaal’s appointment until next week while they continue to talk to Ryan Giggs about his role in the new set-up. The Welshman is still considering his response to Wednesday’s chats with Van Gaal in Amsterdam.

Giggs is known to have reservations about how United have handled the whole affair since David Moyes was sacked last month.

Uncertain futures: Ryan Giggs and Phil Neville

His former team-mates Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are said to be increasingly unhappy about being kept in the dark, too.

The three United legends — who worked with Giggs during his spell as interim manager — thought they would receive phone calls from the club on Thursday but the trio were still waiting.

An Old Trafford source said: ‘They just want to know one way or the other. If it’s bad news and they aren’t being kept on, then the least that should happen is they should be told.

‘To keep them hanging on, after the way they have served the club, is unfair.’

Waiting game: Paul Scholes, Neville, and Giggs have still not discovered their fate

Neville was told after last Sunday’s game at Southampton his future — and that of his colleagues — would become clear this week.

United chief executive Ed Woodward had hoped to confirm Van Gaal as new manager on Thursday but it is understood Giggs, who wants to stay, is still considering the offer of a senior role.

With Van Gaal in charge of the Dutch national team for their friendly against Ecuador in  Amsterdam on Saturday, it is not expected that anything will now be finalised until after the weekend — even though United sources have stressed there is ‘no significant problem’ with the process.

Meanwhile, Southampton’s England defender Luke Shaw has been telling friends this week that he is ‘definitely’ moving to Old Trafford, despite the fact that a fee has not been agreed between the clubs.

Woodward outlined the exact scale of the financial impact Moyes’ difficult eight-month reign had on the deposed Premier League champions.

United finished seventh in the Premier League, meaning they will play no European football next season.

In a conference call with investors on the day United’s latest quarterly accounts were released, Woodward revealed the cost of the failure as £30million.

‘Due to the television deals, we estimate our loss of European football will cost us in the mid-£30m region,’ said Woodward.

‘The club’s expectations are to absolutely get back into the Champions League and you will see that in the transfer market.

‘In the 2013-14 season we finished in a very disappointing seventh which means we will not play European football next season.

‘Be assured everyone at the club is working to ensure that next season is to the top standards of Manchester United.

‘We made a managerial change in April and are grateful to Ryan Giggs for holding the reins during the period and the exemplary manner he conducted the role,’ added Woodward.

‘We are now focused on bringing in a new manager and expect an announcement in due course.’ 

In terms of Van Gaal’s appointment, United are also aware of the need to be respectful towards the Dutch FA, whose plans for the World Cup in Brazil have been rather overshadowed by the saga.

Partly because of this, United are not expected to announce anything on Friday, with Holland’s game against Ecuador so close.

United announced January-March revenues of £115.5m — up 26 per cent. The three-quarter results also saw the club’s debt down 4.3per cent to £351.7m.

United continue to blossom financially, with sponsorship and broadcasting income both making big leaps in the results.
