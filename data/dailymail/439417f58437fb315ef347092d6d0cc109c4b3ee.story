An imprisoned Saudi blogger who denounced Islam is facing the death penalty according to his wife.

Raif Badawi. who set up the Free Saudi Liberals blog is currently in prison, and according to his wife Ensaf Haidar, he must go before a high court on a charge of apostasy.

He would receive the death penalty if convicted by the courts according to Amnesty International.

Raif Badawi has been in prison since 2012, and his wife claims that he is facing a death sentence

In July, a criminal court found Badawi guilty of insulting Islam through his website and in television comments.

He was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes, but his lawyer has appealed against the punishment.

Badawi set up his website in 2008 and has been in prison since 2012.

The year the site was launched he was detained for one day and questioned, with some clerics branding him an unbeliever and apostate.

His wife and their children have now left the country and now live in Lebanon.

Amnesty International told CNN that Badawi's case shows that Saudi Arabia is not a place where people can debate openly about their beliefs.

A spokesman said: 'Is clear case of intimidation against him and others who seek to engage in open debates about the issues that Saudi Arabians face in their daily lives.'
