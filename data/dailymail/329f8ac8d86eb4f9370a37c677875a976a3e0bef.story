A pensioner who was hit by a car and knocked unconscious was left lying in the road bleeding because an ambulance failed to turn up for 90 minutes.

Margaret Freeborn, 69, was walking to a church meeting when she was hit by a car at a pelican crossing in Atherton, Greater Manchester.

Police shut the road and an ambulance was called but one did not turn up to help Mrs Freeborn, who was lying on the ground and bleeding from the head, for almost two hours.

Mrs Freeborn is still being treated in hospital for her injuries after the accident, which took place more than a week ago. She has been left with torn ligaments and severe bruises.

Tania Freeborn-Hulme, Mrs Freeborn's daughter, lives near the site of the crash in Mealhouse Lane in Atherton, and ran out to help her mother.

'No one came, no rapid response, no paramedics - no one,' said Mrs Freeborn-Hulme. 

'She was lying on the floor for almost two hours with only witnesses and bystanders to help.

'She was bleeding from her head and unconscious at first. The hospital couldn't believe that she'd not broken anything other than her nose. 

'Her ligaments in both legs are torn and she is black and blue all over.

'It was devastating seeing her like that. We are angry that she could be left in the road all that time in pain, the police arrived fairly quickly but couldn't do anything other than stop the traffic.

Mrs Freeborn is still badly bruised more than a week after she was knocked unconscious by the car 

The accident happened at about 7.45pm but an ambulance did not turn up until 9.20pm.

National targets stipulate that ambulances should respond to 75 per cent of cases deemed as the most urgent, life threatening within seven minutes. 

Other targets are set locally. North West Ambulance Service also has green categories, where for patients who require an ambulance but are not seen as being in a life threatening condition, paramedics should arrive within 30 minutes.

A spokeswoman from the ambulance service said the call was classed as a 'green 2', based on the information given by the caller.Paramedics breached their own target by an hour, as this call requires an ambulance to attend within 30 minutes. 

Police cordoned off the road but paramedics still did not arrive to help the pensioner for 90 minutes

Mrs Freeborn-Hulme added: 'A witness called an ambulance immediately, yet one did not arrive until around 9.20pm.

'We were told that an ambulance had been allocated at 9.07pm but it still did not arrive until about 9.20pm.'

Mrs Freeborn was going to a meeting at Bag Lane Methodist Church in Atherton, when she was hit by a Nissan Juke as she crossed the road on November 19. 

Her brother Glyn Williams, who also lives nearby but was not able to get through the police road blocks, said: 'There were police everywhere but she was just left there crying in the middle of the road because there was no one else there.' 

The 69-year-old was taken to Royal Bolton Hospital and then transferred to Salford Royal Hospital where she is still receiving treatment for her injuries.

The North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust confirmed that they received the call at 7.47pm but said the crew arrived on scene at 9.07pm.

A spokesman said: 'We understand that waiting for an ambulance can be distressing and we are sorry for any upset caused to the patient and their family.

'We take complaints about our service extremely seriously and would urge the patient or family to contact us as soon as possible so we can investigate the reasons behind the delay.'

A police spokesman said they were treating it as an accident and they would not be taking any action against the driver.
