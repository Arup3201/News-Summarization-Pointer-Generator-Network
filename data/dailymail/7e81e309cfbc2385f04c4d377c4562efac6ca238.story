'Cause of amusement': Captain Susie King in her 'unflattering' army uniform

Finding flattering maternity wear is often an uphill battle. 

So spare a thought for Britain’s military mums-to-be who are up in arms about the Army’s uniform for pregnant soldiers.

Standard-issue maternity kit, which dates back almost to the Cold War, has been blasted for being more Ministry of Defence than Mothercare, and condemned as poor quality, unprofessional and badly fitting.

The criticism has prompted top brass to order a review into modernising uniforms for female troops with a baby bump.

Despite being forced to cut thousands of troops and equipment to save money, military chiefs will spend hundreds of thousands of pounds designing and introducing the new fatigues.

It is the latest move by the Ministry of Defence to ensure the military is ‘inclusive’ and does not discriminate against service personnel – but it runs the risk of charges of political correctness.

Pregnant troops in the Army are currently issued long-sleeved blouses, pregnancy trousers with an elasticated waist, an unstylish beige maternity dress and a cardigan.

Captain Susie King, who serves in the Royal Signals, highlighted the problem in the latest issue of Soldier, the Army’s magazine.

She said: ‘As a pregnant woman trying to work right up until my due date I’m shocked at how poor the Army’s maternity wear is.

‘I have spent the last eight months switching between clothing as my bump grew. I initially went down the route of getting larger and larger sizes of standard shirt and trousers.

‘I then tailored my slacks myself using elastic panels so that I didn’t have to wear a pair that swamped me in other areas.

‘However, a couple of months ago this no longer sufficed.’ 

‘I switched to the issued maternity trousers but when I wore them for a whole day their elastic panel gradually lost its strength and they had a habit of suddenly falling to the floor. 

‘My last option was the unstylish beige maternity dress, worn with beret cardigan and brown lace up shoes.

‘It’s fair to say the look this creates has generated a fair amount of amusement among my colleagues.

‘It’s not really a laughing matter when pregnant serving women are being denied the opportunity to look professional in the workplace.

‘Can’t we be supplied with smart maternity garments that look and work as well as the standard versions?’ 

Lieutenant Colonel Simon Blake, in charge of logistic support at Army Headquarters, said maternity wear was ‘under scrutiny’ and were set to be modernised now troops were withdrawing from Afghanistan.

He said: ‘The view is that although the range of clothing is sufficient its design is dated and its functionality can be improved.

‘MoD uniform acquisition has been focused on operational requirements in the last few years with combat garments and high profile parade and ceremonial uniforms understandably being the top priorities.

‘As the Army returns to contingency we are looking more at workwear appearance and it’s hoped this will include the maternity uniforms.’

The Ministry of Defence said the move is to ensure that the military is inclusive and does not discriminate

Earlier this year, the Mail revealed that more than 200 servicewomen have been sent home from war zones after discovering they were pregnant.

An astonishing 99 were evacuated from Afghanistan and 102 from Iraq under strict rules that ban mothers-to-be from serving on the front line.

Commanders ordered them to return to Britain - sometimes on flights reserved for injured troops - as soon as their condition became known.

The Ministry of Defence routinely orders around 1,000 maternity uniforms a year.

According to the latest MoD figures, around 15,800 women serve in the Armed Forces – about 9.9 per cent of the total. For the Army, there are nearly 8.000 female service personnel – 8.7 per cent.

At any one time around 500 to 600 women have been posted to Afghanistan and in the last eight years around 7,000 have served in Helmand.

No women are deployed in the units where the primary role is to ‘close with and kill’ the enemy, or to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy.

It means they are barred from all infantry battalions, tank regiments, the Royal Marine Commandos and Special Forces.

But female servicemen do go out on patrol with combat units and risk firefights while doing supporting roles such as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, logisticians or signallers.

Until August 1990, servicewomen could be sacked for becoming pregnant. In that year, the Armed Forces were no longer excluded from equality laws.

It is thought more than £50million has been paid in compensation to 3,500 former servicewomen who were unfairly dismissed.

An MoD spokesperson said: ‘All three services offer maternity clothing which are designed in consultation with our female personnel.

'The current designs are from 2004 and we regularly review them to ensure they meet the requirements.’
