A team of researchers in Adelaide are trying to develop a 'pain switch' in the human body to potentially eradicate the need for highly-addictive pain killers.

Researchers from Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide have spent three years looking at ways to turn off pain with a genetic switch that would be delivered up a person's spine via a harmless virus.

Associate Professor Nick Spencer has been leading the research and is now using genetic therapies using harmless viruses to test the pain switch theory on animals.

The research was inspired by a Pakistani boy who used to walk on hot coals as he busked for money. 

Scientists who were curious to find out how he could do it pain free found he had a rare genetic mutation, which means he lacked the gene that notified the brain of any pain.

Using that information, the team at Flinders Medical Centre are trying to locate all of the nerve endings in a body that detect pain from various organs.

'We know in humans that if you have an extremely rare mutation and lack this gene you don't feel pain at all,' Prof Spencer told the Advertiser.

'The virus takes a molecule to shut down the gene, it shuts down the channels for pain.

'This is really exciting – we are not ready to move on to humans yet but it is very exciting.'

The testing on animals has so far reduced pain by 75 percent from the gastrointestinal tract without affecting other organs in the body.

'Today if someone has severe pain they will probably be given an opioid like morphine that is very good at relieving pain but has a whole range of side effects,' Prof Spencer said.

'You can get sedated, addicted, build tolerance, suffer from withdrawal and constipation, you can't drive a vehicle or think straight – your whole body is affected – that's the big problem.'
