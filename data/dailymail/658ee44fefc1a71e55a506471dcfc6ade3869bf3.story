A drilling crew punctured a gas pipeline in North Texas on Thursday and triggered an explosion that led emergency personnel to evacuate an etire nearby town.

The explosion occurred about 9:30 a.m. at a rig near Milford, about 40 miles south of Dallas when a Chevron crew punctured a 10-inch line liquefied petroleum gas line.

Flames could be seen shooting into the air and some vehicles at the worksite burned tower of billowing black smoke could be seen from miles away.

Tower of flames: A huge fire broke out in a North Texas field Thursday after a Chevron crew accidentally punctured a 10-inch gas pipeline with a drill

Haunting: The entire town of Milford, population 700, was evacuated amid the haunting black smoke after the explosion around 9:30am for fear the flames could trigger additional explosions

Sheriff's spokesman James Saulter said no injuries have been reported.

Chevron requested that Milford be evacuated. Saulter said deputies went door-to-door advising people in the town of about 700 to leave.

Milford school Superintendent Don Clingenpeel said all students and staff were evacuated to the nearby town of Italy.

‘The biggest concern right now is the pipelines that are around to make sure there's not going to be additional explosions,’ Saulter said.

No casualties: The cloud of thick, black smoke could be seen for miles following the explosion, which thankfully injured no one in the town of Milford

Still flowing: Officials are allowing the fire to burn out but have not shut off gas to the line because, according to one official, the flow of gas cools down the pipe

Another 14-inch line runs a few feet from the one that blew up and gas was still flowing because stopping it would increase the risk of a secondary explosion, Tom Hemrick, director of Hill County Emergency Management, told KTVT.

‘It is still flowing because the flow cools the line,’ Hemrick said.

Saulter said Chevron has indicated it could take 24 hours to bring the fire under control and cap the ruptured line. He said it's not clear how long the evacuation will last.

Chevron did not identify the line that exploded.

Lingering fears: The explosion occurred in an empty field in the town of Milford. Another gas line is located very close to burning line, causing officials to fear the additional explosions

But a state regulator said it was part of the West Texas LPG Pipeline Limited Partnership, a 2,295-mile common-carrier pipeline system that transports natural gas liquids from New Mexico and Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas, for processing.

Chevron owns 80 percent of the pipeline system and Atlas Pipeline Partners has a 20 percent stake.

A local CBS-TV affiliate broadcast footage of big flames rising from a field and engulfing what appeared to be a drilling rig or other large piece of equipment. Several nearby pickup trucks were burned.
