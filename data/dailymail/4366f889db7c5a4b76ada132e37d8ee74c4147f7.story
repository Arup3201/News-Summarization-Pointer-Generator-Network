BT Sport has sent shockwaves through the football world by outbidding Sky and ITV to secure exclusive rights to broadcast top European matches.

The telecommunications giant has agreed a stunning £299million a season, three-year deal to show all 350 Champions League and Europa League games from 2015/16.

It represents a staggering coup for the fledgling channel - which only launched in August this year - to have beaten off Sky, which has dominated the live football landscape in Britain for more two decades, while ITV has broadcast the Champions League since 1992.

Mega deal: BT Sport has blown its rivals out of the water with a staggering £900m deal to show Champions League football

End of an era: ITV - originally with Bob Wilson anchoring the show - have shown the Champions League live since its creation in 1992

It means that, for the first time, fans will have to pay to watch European matches, which have always been shown on terrestrial television.

Although BT Sport says it will make a handful of matches available for free, including the finals of both competitions, supporters will have to buy BT broadband or pay a subscription to watch through their Sky box.

Making some matches free will appeal to sponsors, which was ITV's main trumpcard in its relationship with Europe's football governing body, Uefa.

Gavin Patterson, BT chief executive, said: 'I am thrilled that BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Uefa Champions League and Uefa Europa League.

'Both tournaments are world class and firm favourites with many. The live rights will give a major boost to BT Sport and give people yet another reason to take our terrific service.'

Overpriced: TV rivals Sky said the company has overpaid for the rights

The BT channels are also showing live FA Cup games and live football from the top leagues in Germany, Italy, France and Scotland plus the FA Women's Super League.

Away from football, there will also be rugby union and women's tennis, plus MotoGP coverage from next year.

Mr Patterson added: 'BT Sport has got off to a strong start with customers enjoying what we have to offer. We have attracted millions of customers by giving sport back to the fans, and we can assure people who want to catch all the action, that European football will be far more accessible and affordable with BT.'

Sky, which is thought to have nearly matched BT's bid, said its rival had paid 'far in excess' of its own valuation for the rights to the European matches.

A statement from Sky read: 'We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation.

'There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more.

'Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now re-deploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering.'
