Vogue Italia has worked with Asian models before but never on the cover

Sun, 23, has also featured on the cover of i-D magazine

French Vogue was the first to put a Chinese model on its cover, using Du Juan in a 2011 edition

She has starred in campaigns for Calvin Klein, Valentino and Diesel, as well as featuring on the covers of Chinese Vogue and Elle.

But now Chinese supermodel Fei Fei Sun can add pioneer to her lengthy CV.

The model has become the first Asian to feature on the cover of Vogue Italia - a groundbreaking development for the fashion glossy.

In the UK, Sun has been photographed for the cover of i-D magazine and has featured in fashion editorial in British Vogue.

The model also made her international catwalk debut in Britain when she walked for Mulberry and up-and-coming designer Nathan Jenden in September 2009.

Since then Fei Fei Sun has walked for a veritable who's who of big names, with appearances on the Vivienne Westwood, Miu Miu, Dries van Noten and 3.1 Phillip Lim catwalks among many others.

The model has also landed starring roles in some of the biggest beauty campaigns on the planet, including becoming the face of DKNY's Be Delicious fragrance and Calvin Klein's One.

Although Sun and her compatriot, fellow Chinese supermodel Du Juan, have previously featured in Italian Vogue editorial, this is the first time that an Asian model has made the cover of the Italian glossy.

French Vogue was the first European magazine to include an Asian model on its cover, when Du Juan appeared on an issue in 2011.

It's famous for its conservative culture but Arab models are quickly catching up with their Chinese counterparts in terms of demand from big names.

Although Fei Fei Sun and Du Juan are currently making waves, expect to hear much more of Morocco's Hind Sahli and Tunisia's Hanaa ben Abdesslem in future.

Asked by the BBC to describe the reaction to her burgeoning career back home, Sahli said:

'Mostly, I have had positive reactions. Most people think it's good to have a Moroccan model. I have had just a few bad reactions from people, but I don't mind - I'm happy what I'm doing.'

British and U.S. Vogue have yet to follow suit by featuring an Asian model as a cover girl - but both titles are known for their use of celebrity cover models rather than catwalk stalwarts.

Both, however, have featured Asian models in their fashion editorial.

Indeed, Anna Wintour's U.S. Vogue caused controversy with an all-Asian shoot two years ago.

The Stephen Meisel shoot, which was styled by flame-haired fashion director, Grace Coddington, and appeared in the December 2010 issue, was accused of being 'tokenist', while others questioned the premise that Asian models are 'redefining traditional concepts of beauty'.

'Traditional concepts of beauty where, exactly?' asked Huffington Post blogger, Disgrasian. 'Because there are plenty of places in the world where, traditionally speaking, Asian women have long been considered beautiful. Like in, um, Asia, for example?'

French Vogue is no stranger to race-related controversy either, with the French glossy causing an uproar in October 2009 when it published an editorial shoot that included images of white models with blacked up faces.

The shoot, which featured Dutch model Lara Stone, passed unnoticed in France but caused a storm in the USA, with critics describing it as 'culturally insensitive' and 'a step back in time'.
