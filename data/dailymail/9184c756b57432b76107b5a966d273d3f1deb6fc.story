The medical examiner says an unarmed man who intervened in a confrontation between police and a knife-wielding assailant died of a gunshot to the back after police fired shots.

NYPD spokesman Stephen Davis says Rafael Laureano was 'inadvertently' struck by a police bullet on Monday in Brooklyn. The assailant, Francisco Carvajal, also died in the shooting.

Police say Laureano had gone to the apartment after Carvajal's former girlfriend called him for help. They say he rushed past officers to confront Carvajal.

When officers arrived, they found Francisco Carvajal, 47, armed with a knife and Rafael Laureano, 51, inside the apartment, police said.

A woman – identified as Katarzyna Russo – and two children, ages 6 and 7, had also locked themselves in a bathroom as the suspect tried to get inside, police said. They said Laureano was the woman’s current boyfriend, while Carvajal was her ex.

Police said Laureano confronted Carvajal, who was then shot by police after he refused orders to drop the knife. Carvajal man was pronounced dead at the scene.

Laureano apparently confronted Carvajal after the ex-boyfriend came to talk to Russo.

Laureano already had been stabbed when he met police outside as they arrived at the seventh-floor apartment, and Laureano ran past officers back into the apartment when he got to the front door, police said.

Laureano and Carvajal struggled again, and Carvajal was stabbing Laureano again when officers opened fire, sources said.

Laureano was pronounced dead at Maimonides Medical Center.

Police initially said Laureano died of stab wounds. But the New York City Medical Examiner’s office determined that his death was actually caused by a perforating gunshot wound to the back.

Police say officers told Carvajal to drop the knife several times.

Police initially had said that Laureano was stabbed before officers arrived. The medical examiner said no stab wounds were found on his body.

The woman and her two young children were not harmed. 

Police sources said the Laureano’s death was accidental and he was not the intended target. The officers’ shots were fired during the struggle between Laureano and Carvajal, in which officers were not involved.

Police were outside the building where the bloody melee took place
