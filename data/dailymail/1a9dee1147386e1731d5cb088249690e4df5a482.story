The housewife and whistle blower at the center of the David Petraeus sex scandal and another involving General John Allen may have been hoping for some financial gain by lifting the lid on the affair, after it emerged today she and her husband are broke.

Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, 37, and her cancer surgeon husband Scott owe millions to banks after the collapse of their real estate holdings in 2010.

The Kelleys are currently the targets of
 at least four indebtedness lawsuits and two foreclosures in 
Hillsborough County, according to court records.

Speaking out: Jill Kelley, the Florida housewife at the centre of the David Petraeus sex scandal has spoken for the first time and said she is an 'innocent victim'

Gossip Extra reported today that the Kelleys are fighting to keep their properties.

Jill has been called the 'other woman' 
in the Petraeus sex scandal, which was exposed after she took 
threatening emails to the FBI sent from biographer and 
alleged mistress Paula Broadwell warning her to stay away from the CIA chief.

Now that the state of their finances 
has been exposed, speculation is rife Jill broke the scandal so she 
could make money from it.

She has now also been dragged into a second scandal after General John R. Allen, commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, has been accused of sending thousands of 'inappropriate' emails to her.

Allen is under investigation by the FBI after the agency discovered between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of communication between him and the 37-year-old housewife.

If he is found to have engaged in an extramarital affair - a crime in the military - he faces being court martialed, bringing a spectacular fall from grace and the end to a glittering army career that has spanned nearly 40 years.

Central Bank 
have a suit against the Kelleys and Kelly Land Holdings, centered on a three-story 
office building downtown Tampa. 

Court records 
show they owed the bank nearly $2.2 million, including attorney fees. In 2011, a judge ordered the property to be put up for sale.

Regions Bank, meanwhile, is trying to
 foreclose on the couple's historic $1.3million waterfront house, 
claiming they defaulted on a $271,000-credit line with their five 
bedroom house as collateral, according to Gossip Extra.

It is currently worth $840,000 and though it is one of the most spectacular on Bayshore Boulevard from the outside, the 1923 built home is in need of repair.

Paintwork on the home is peeling and behind the home the driveway leading to a triple garage is cracked and covered with weeds.

The front lawn, where Kelley would host 
catered parties attended by the military, remains immaculate but out of 
sight in an alleyway running at the rear of the property rubbish is 
piled high against a wall.

Lawyers hired by the socialite couple would not comment on the state of their finances.

Details: The FBI will not elaborate on the 
nature of the relationship between Allen, the senior allied commander in
 Afghanistan, and Florida housewife Jill Kelley, except to say that it 
is 'potentially inappropriate'

Jill Kelley insisted yesterday she has never been romantically involved with Petraeus but is the 'innocent victim' in the scandal.

The socialite is better known in Tampa for throwing charity
 parties on the front lawn of her house. In fact, Petraeus and his wife Holly marked his first celebration of the Gasparilla pirate parade on 
the Kelleys' lawn.

The two couples became friends after 
Petraeus took over the military’s Central Command at Tampa’s McDill Air 
Force Base in 2008 where Jill  was a volunteer social liaison.

Jill Kelley spoke with her lawyer brother as her name first became linked to the resignation of Petraeus.

David
 Khawam told the Washington Post his sister telephoned him on Sunday and
 told him to switch on the TV because her name was all over news 
broadcasts.

Khawam said his sister told him she was totally innocent and was not the 'other woman' in Petraeus' life.

He is quoted as saying his sister said: 'I've done nothing wrong. I am the victim here. But it still feels awful.'

Friends
 of Kelley, a vivacious Lebanese-born mother-of-three, known for her 
love of expensive designer dresses, have told MailOnline that she is 
devoted to her family and scoffed at suggestions she was romantically 
involved with Petraeus.

'This other woman obviously read all the signs wrong,' said a friend who knows Kelley from their children’s private school.

'Jill is very attractive and can be touchy-feely. That’s just the way she is and there is nothing else.'

Kelley,
 a well-known figure on the social scene in her hometown of Tampa, 
Florida, has hired the same crisis management firm Monica Lewinsky did 
after the Clinton scandal and a top lawyer used by John Edwards since 
being linked to the scandal.

This has led to speculation that further damaging details could be revealed in the fall out from Petraeus’ resignation.

Sources have revealed the emails she received from Broadwell were 'kind of cat-fight stuff'.

Kelley
 went to the FBI with the emails - and triggered the investigation that 
led to the downfall of Petraeus and his shock resignation as CIA chief.

The
 source told The Daily Beast the emails were: 'More like, "Who do you 
think you are? … You parade around the base … You need to take it down a
 notch".'

The Wall Street Journal reported that in one of the emails, Broadwell asked Kelley if her husband was aware of her actions.

Another accused Kelley of touching Petraeus provocatively under a table.

The source also said Kelley would often accompany Petraeus' wife Holly on shopping trips to the International Mall in Tampa.

Kelley, whose husband is a top cancer surgeon, has dodged questions from the media.

Before leaving her home she called police to the $1.3 million mansion to ask media to respect her privacy.

She left the home in a silver Mercedes with the registration plate 'Honorary Consul' - a nod to her work as an unpaid liaison officer for the military headquarters at MacDill Airforce Base.

It was during Petraeus' two years in Tampa at the CENTCOM headquarters that he became friends with Kelley and her husband Scott.

The friendship continued after the general left Tampa with the Kelley’s visiting the Petaeus’s home in Washington DC.
