Premier League: Newcastle United (£15)

Championship: Derby and Sheff Wed (£10)

League One: Rochdale (£15)

League Two: Bury, Burton, Tranmere (£15)

Conference: Eastleigh (£12) 

Newcastle United offer the cheapest match-day ticket in the  Premier League at just £15.

Those attending St James' Park will pay less than any of the other 19 teams in England's top flight, and there is not a single more expensive ticket in League Two either.

The BBC Price of Football survey reveals  Chelsea sit at the opposite end of the cheapest-ticket table with fans forced to fork out at least £50 to get in to Stamford Bridge.

It gives Newcastle fans reason to be cheerful - even if the tickets were to sit them in the heavens of their 52,000-seater stadium - as under-fire manager Alan Pardew  clings to his job.

While Assem Allam awaits a buyer at the KC Stadium, the Hull City owner charges just £16 for fans to come watch Steve Bruce's men on match days.

But it comes as little surprise that  seeing the Premier League's elite will cost you a pretty penny.

While Jose Mourinho's Chelsea sit top in terms of points and price, Manchester City and Liverpool follow close behind. 

Both Premier League title chasers charge £37 to get in to the Etihad and Anfield. Louis van Gaal's Manchester United, meanwhile, charge £36 for those wishing to visit Old Trafford.

More surprisingly, though, is Arsenal sit mid-table in the cheapest-ticket list, considering the Emirates is the priciest around for an annual pass. The cheapest Arsenal season ticket sits at £1,014 while the most expensive is £2,013.
