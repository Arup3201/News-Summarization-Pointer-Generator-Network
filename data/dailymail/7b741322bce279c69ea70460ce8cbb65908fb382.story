Should Brendan Rodgers require any inspiration for his Liverpool players ahead of a match with Crystal Palace that they must win well to stand a chance of claiming the title, a DVD of the sides’ meeting in September 1989 would be a good idea.

Not only did Liverpool win 9-0, they went on to lift the title – their last to date. The same scoreline at Selhurst Park would wipe out Manchester City’s advantage on goal difference and place pressure on their rivals ahead of Aston Villa’s trip to the Etihad on Wednesday.

With Tony Pulis’s side well-drilled that remains a remote possibility but memories of that match offer Liverpool, who have five times score five or more in a Premier League game this season, an opportunity to hope.

Yet later in the 1989/90 season it was Palace who stopped Liverpool when it really mattered. Alan Pardew rose to head an extra-time winner in the FA Cup semi-final to deny Liverpool an unprecedented double.

With such omens offering some food for thought, it remains to be seen which Liverpool will turn up tonight; the team that has brushed aside many others this year, or the one which stalled against a resolute Chelsea?

In the 1989/90 season Palace were freshly promoted and came unstuck at Anfield as eight different players found the net – the only time this has happened in the top-flight of English football.

Steve Nicol opened and closed the scoring, with Steve McMahon, Ian Rush, Gary Gillespie, Peter Beardsley, John Aldridge, John Barnes and Glenn Hysen notching in between. To add to Palace's misery, Geoff Thomas missed a penalty. Palace did stay up, mind.

Final flourish: Alan Pardew (number 11) headed home a 109th-minute winner to send Palace to Wembley

But seven months later Palace had their revenge. Despite entering the match as huge underdogs and twice going behind, Steve Coppell’s team triumphed.

Rush opened the scoring early before Mark Bright and Gary O’Reilly put Palace ahead. McMahon equalised and when Barnes converted a penalty in the 83rd minute in seemed Liverpool were set for Wembley.

But Andy Gray levelled again with two minutes left and Pardew won it in the 109th minute of an epic match.
