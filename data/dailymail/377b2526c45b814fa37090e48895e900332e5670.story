Apple is preparing to launch a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales.

The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite, and news iPads next month.

The new iPads are set to use a thinner design similar to the iPhone 6 and include a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.

iThe new iMacs are expected to retain a similar design to the current model (pictured) but include an ultra high definition Retina screen.

The iPad is expected to have a 9.7 inch screen, while the new version of the iPad mini will have a 7.9 inch screen, Bloomberg earlier reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The iPads are expected to have a thinner, curved design similar to the new iPhone 6, and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.

Apple is also believed to be working on a larger 'iPad Plus' for release next year with a 12.9inch screen. 

 

'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac. 

'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved WiFi antennas,' it says.

The firm will also launch a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite.

The first thing that strikes you about Yosemite is that there is less to look at.

Gones are the bells and whistles, the fake leather and other distractions of previous versions.

Instead, what you have is, without doubt, the best looking operating system ever seen.

Apple's obsession with detail is clear, and when combined with high high resolution retina display of the firm's latest laptops, the difference is incredibly obvious.

Even the tiny details, such as a new font Apple designed, give everything a crisp, uncluttered feel.

Menus also now have a transparent feel, giving the system an almost glass-like feel as you move windows around.

Although iOS 8 is not yet available so we were unable to try out the call and 'handoff' features, the new notification centre on screen gives a real sense that the iPhone, iPad and Mac are now one system, system than three separate gadgets.

The Yosemite software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if their iPhone is in another room.

Notifications can carry over from your iPhone, and the 'today' view mimics that iPhone users are used to.

Also surprisingly useful are the upgrades to Spotlight, the Mac's search system.

Searching now shows you information from Wikipedia pages, and you can even search the web without having to open a seperate browser window - although it does Bing rather than Google.

you can also do basic sums, and even currency conversions form the spotlight window, and even show you cinema times if you search for a film - a real timesaver.

The mail app has also been updated, with a new 'markup' feature that lets you easily draw on images - which is great fun to play with.

Surprisingly for what is still a test piece of software, Yosemite also feels incredibly fast and snappy.

As well as being the best looking OS we've ever seen, Yosemite really does give a glimpse into the future of Apple, where all your devices work together seamlessly - as long at they are made by Apple.

The Yosemite software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if their  iPhone is in another room.

The software has also been overhauled with a new 'flat' look, and can search the web without having to open a browser.

The software is the first to be overseen by Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive, who was recently given responsibility for the design of both hardware and software at Apple.
