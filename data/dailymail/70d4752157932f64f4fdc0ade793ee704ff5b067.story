Swansea got their pre-season campaign back on track with a 3-1 win over Championship side Reading at the Madejski Stadium.

A first-half double from Wayne Routledge and Bafétimbi Gomis' second goal for the club was enough for Garry Monk's side to record their third pre-season win, with Nick Blackman's superb volley a mere consolation for the Royals.

After losing to Bournemouth on Friday night, the Swans fielded a near full-strength side this time around and the quality shone through in a close first half.

Celebrations: Bony, Sigurdsson and Routledge celebrate Swansea's opening goal against Reading

Stand-off: Nick Blackman scored a superb volley in his side's friendly defeat to Swansea

The Premier League side should have taken the lead as early as the 14th minute after they were awarded a penalty when Sean Morrison handled inside the area, despite the ball being bundled in at the back post.

Reading: McCarthy (Federici 45), Gunter (c), Pearce, Morrison, Progrebnyak, Obita, Hector (Kuhl 70) Akpan (Tshibola 72), Edwards (Tanner 68), Blackman, Taylor (Cummings 72).

Swansea: Fabianski, Tiendalli (Rangel 90), Williams (c), Bartley, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Gomis, Sigurdsson, Routledge (Dyer 66), Bony (Montero 66).

Goals: Routledge 23 & 25, Gomis 65. Blackman 43

Attendance: 5,421

Wilfried Bony stepped up to take the spot-kick but fired the ball against the crossbar as the game remained goalless.

Gomis then went close eight minutes later as Dwight Tiendalli found the former Lyon man in the box, but Alex McCarthy got down well to put the ball out for a corner.

The visitors weren't to be denied though as they scored a quick-fire double to put them firmly in the ascendancy. 

Summer signing Gylfi Sigurdsson teed up Bony whose threaded pass found Routledge who made no mistake inside the area to put  Swansea ahead on 23 minutes.

Just a couple of minutes later it was two after Sigurdsson and Bony were again heavily involved in the build-up, with Routledge providing the decisive finish for his and his side's second goal.

The Royals then went close to halving the deficit as Michael Hector's audacious 25-yard strike was palmed away by Lukasz Fabianski on 34 minutes.

Power: Bony looked lively for the Premier League side while also missing a penalty in the first half

The Championship side did pull one back just before the interval though as Blackman's 30-yard wonder strike flew into the back of the net to give the Royals renewed hope.

Swansea looked to extend their advantage after the break with goalscorer Routledge nearly turning provider as Gomis struck the post from 20 yards out.

On 65 minutes Gomis did restore Swansea's two-goal advantage though, in turn notching his second goal for the club after racing through on goal and lobbing Adam Federici to make it 3-1.

Both sides made changes aplenty as the game drew to a close after a entertaining friendly in Berkshire. Swansea play Villarreal in their final pre-season fixture before they travel to Manchester United on the opening day of the Premier League season. Elsewhere, Reading face a trip to Wigan next weekend for their first Championship encounter of the new season.
