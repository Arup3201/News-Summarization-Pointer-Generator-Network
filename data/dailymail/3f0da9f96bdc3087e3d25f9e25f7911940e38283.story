The moon may be a familiar sight in the night sky – but because it's tidally locked to Earth, there is one side of the lunar surface we never see.

This side was a mystery for centuries. It wasn't until the Soviet Luna 3 probe visited the area in 1959, that astronomers had any real idea of what it looked like.

Now Nasa has released a stunning animation of the moon's far side - once known as the 'dark side' - with Earth looming in the background.

The animation reveals the phases of the moon from this unusual angle, using data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

'Just like the near side, the far side goes through a complete cycle of phases,' Nasa explains in the video.

'But the terrain of the far side is quite different. It lacks the large dark spots, called maria, that make up the familiar Man in the Moon on the near side.'

The animation takes the moon through the 29.5 day period of phases.

In another series of animations, a spinning Earth looms large in a time-lapse telescopic view.

The animation places an imaginary line between the Earth and the Moon. From this vantage point, the moon looks full, but on Earth, it's a waning crescent.

With a view fixed on the moon, the rest of the solar system seems to dance around it.

The far side is also home to one of the largest and oldest impact features in the solar system, the South Pole-Aitken basin, visible in the animation as a slightly darker bruise covering the bottom third of the disk.

Its diameter is roughly 1,550 miles (2,500 km), making it stretch across nearly a quarter of the moon.

While parts of the crater are shrouded in perpetual darkness, its rim features huge mountainous peaks that are bathed in near-constant sunlight.

Esa wants to send robots to these peaks, and eventually humans.

It says the crater's rim is an ideal place to land humans because they have 'the potential for near continuous solar power and a spectacular view over the rugged and cratered landscape below.

The far side of the moon could someday be home to human colonies if Esa has its way

The European Space Agency believes that conquering the moon is a crucial step for human deep space exploration.

In a video, titled 'Destination: Moon', the agency outlines its plans for making a home on the hostile terrain that covers the far side of the lunar surface.

'In the future, the moon can become a place where the nations of the world can come together to understand our common origins, to build a common future, and to share a common journey beyond,' the video says. 

Esa is hoping to find out if water exists  on the moon, and if so, they want to understand where it can be found.

If the moon has huge stores of water, future colonies could use the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to create rocket fuel.

'[This could] propel us further into the solar system and onto the next destination of our journey into the cosmos,' the video says.

Future missions could also use the far side of the moon as a shield against radio signals coming from Earth in order to look farther into space.
