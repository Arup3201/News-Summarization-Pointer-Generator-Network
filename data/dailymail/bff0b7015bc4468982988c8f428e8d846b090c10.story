Two brothers have become the first British children to be fitted with the ‘injectable’ heart rate monitors, using smartphone technology to transmit information about their heartbeat to doctors.

Eight-year-old Ethan Roper and Kyle, seven, were each implanted with a tiny device called a Reveal Linq Insertable Cardiac Monitor  on Valentine’s Day.

The miniature heart rate monitors record the rhythm of their heart 24 hours a day.

Success: Kyle and Ethan Roper from Doncaster, the first to have a procedure in the UK to implant a new type of monitor as they are suspected to have heart conditions

In a procedure which took just minutes, under general anaesthetic, their surgeon made a shallow 5mm incision in each boy’s chest, above the heart. The devices were inserted just under the skin using a specially designed plunger.

The technique used is similar to the microchipping of horses and dogs, and the resulting wound is so small it can be glued afterwards, rather than stitched.

The hope is that the device will  be a boon for the millions of Britons who suffer difficult-to-diagnose, life-threatening heart rate disturbances, known as arrhythmia.

Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary decided to fit the brothers with the device to determine whether they have inherited a potentially fatal heart condition from their mother.

The state-of-the-art titanium devices, which cost £1,500 each and have a battery life of three years, look like a computer memory stick and are the size of two matchsticks. Two tiny electrodes within them pick up the electrical pattern of the heart rate and detect any irregularities in the same method as a standard ECG.

Data is sent wirelessly to portable base stations in the boys’ home in Doncaster. It uses a 3G signal to automatically pass that data on  to medical professionals in hospital who analyse the information for abnormalities every day.

Each brother has his own base station. As soon as the boys come within three metres, the base station will download that day’s data so there is no need for them to take the machine to school. They will only have to take the base stations along if they go on holiday or spend long periods away from home.

‘In the past we would have missed symptoms which these devices will now be able to pick up,’ says consultant cardiologist Dr Mike Blackburn, who fitted the devices.

‘We used to rely on cumbersome portable echocardiograms [ECG],  a scanning device that allows us to monitor heart rate for the time that it is attached to the patient. They are about the size of an iPod and come with wires which are taped to the chest and can monitor the heart for a few hours to a week.

‘But the chances of picking up something while the ECG was on was always slim, due to the unpredictable nature of symptoms. We tried this option with both boys but unsurprisingly they offered no conclusive results.’

Early precursors to the injectable monitor have been in use since the late 1990s. Like the Reveal Linq, they were fitted under the skin but didn’t monitor information automatically, working only if the patient set it to record after an episode.

The devices were about seven times the size and had no way of wirelessly transmitting data.

‘We used them in children but they were quite unsightly and much more painful to fit and we used them much less as a result, although we probably would have had to use them in this case,’ says Dr Blackburn.

Doctors had already determined that Ethan has inherited Long QT syndrome from his mother. This is a rare heart condition that can cause fainting and arrhythmia, and if untreated, can be fatal.

A standard ECG identified Ethan’s condition. But doctors wanted to find out whether this was also the case for Kyle, whose ECG results were inconclusive but who recently collapsed at home.

They also wanted to find out whether the medication Ethan was being given was adequate.

‘The difficulty with treatment for this sort of condition is that we only know it’s working when nothing happens,’ says Dr Blackburn.

‘If something does happen, like a collapse, then it can be difficult to determine the cause without having captured it on an ECG. Installing these heart rate monitors means we are guaranteed to pick it up the next time one of the boys has a problem.’

The name ‘Long QT’ refers to an abnormally long gap between the Q and T waves as measured by an ECG, meaning it takes longer for the heart cells in the ventricles to recharge after each heartbeat.

Children with a parent who has  the condition have a 50 per cent of chance of inheriting it themselves.

Patients tend to be prescribed beta-blockers, which help to slow down and stabilise the heart rhythm. If this is unsuccessful, a defibrillator can be fitted which delivers an electric shock to the heart if it stops.

‘Fitting a defibrillator is a big step for young patients, which is why it’s so important to be certain they actually need one,’ says Dr Blackburn.

The boys’ mother Zoe, 34, who is successfully managing her condition with beta-blockers, says fitting them with heart rate monitors came as a great relief.

‘It puts my mind at rest to know they are going to be monitored 24/7,’ says the stay-at-home mum. ‘It’s reassuring to know the doctors  will be alerted straight away to  any abnormalities.’

Zoe was only diagnosed with Long QT syndrome herself last May when she was sent for an ECG after going to see her GP about what she thought was heartburn.

‘They told me my children had a 50/50 chance of inheriting it, which was a shock and really hard to come to terms with. They are very outgoing, cheeky boys. They’re active and live normal lives. They love basketball and their scooters, they never stop. But I’m very protective of them now and like to have them with me all the time. When they’re at school, I’m terrified of getting a call to say one of them has collapsed.

‘I wasn’t worried at all about the surgery as I knew they were in safe hands and Dr Blackburn had reassured me it’s a very safe procedure.

‘The boys came home the same evening and were bouncing around and  back to their normal selves within the hour,’ she adds.
