Law enforcement sources have revealed that authorities investigating the death of Sage Stallone believe he was a drug dealer.

Insiders have apparently  told TMZ that it is thought that a 'likely scenario' is Sage was dealing Hydrocodone- more commonly known as Vicodin- but not an addict himself.

A key factor in this theory is said to be the late actor's weight.

At 188lbs and 5'7", Sage didn't have the thin frame which is usually a trait of addicts.

TMZ was reportedly  told: 'He was pudgy, and drug addicts are almost always rail thin.'

New evidence: Law enforcement sources have revealed that authorities investigating the death of Sage Stallone believe he was a drug dealer

The website's source claims that no 
Hydrocodone tablets were found in Sages house, but that there were over 
60 gigantic empty prescription bottles.

Each of these would have held 500 pills, meaning that Sage would have had over 30,000.

LAPD detectives and L.A. County Coroner investigators will apparently 
use batch numbers and serial numbers to track down the bottles, but it 
is thought highly probably that they were shipped from abroad.

The bags of white powder found in the room where Sage died have not yet been tested, but it is said to be likely that they contained Hydrocodone.

Sage will reportedly be laid to rest in a private service at the weekend.

A source told RadarOnline.com: 'Sage will be buried on Saturday. His body was picked up from the coroner by a mortuary that is based in Westwood earlier this week. The funeral will be private and it will be family and friends only and will be celebration of his life.'

Meanwhile a close friend of Sylvester Stallone's late son has come forward to say that the 36-year-old did not take his own life.

Stephen Wozniak claims that Sage Stallone had no intention of 
committing suicide, and had been making plans for the future with him 
shortly before his demise.

Wozniak told TMZ: 'It was absolutely not suicide.'

He added: ' I'm certain that this really
horrible thing that happened was an accident. It could have been 
anything - but nothing like suicide. I knew him pretty well.'

'I spoke to him a few weeks ago. We talked about resurrecting a film we worked on, other projects, talked about his girlfriend and time they'd spent together. We talked about my wedding and he seemed to be thinking about it.'

While Wozniak does believe that Sage 
suffered from depression, he is adamant that the actor and director did 
not react to the problem with substance abuse.

'He would have withdrawal and get depressed,' he told E! News.

'He
would try to overcompensate. He would try to clown around and I know 
that those are things people do, medicate or wake up. He was no 
different. Very few people were telling him, 'Don't do that.' I did. He 
was very resistant when you would tell him that. It was a sore point 
with him.'

Wozniak's claims
are at odds with those of Sage's mother, Sylvester's first wife Sasha 
Czack, who has blamed the painkillers her son was using after recent 
dental surgery for his death.

Probe: The actor has hired Scott Ross, who has previously worked on the Chris Brown and Rihanna case, and Michael Jackson molestation case

Bags of white powder were found in the room where Sage Stallone died, it has been claimed.

Law enforcement sources allegedly told TMZ
that detectives at the scene discovered 'several little baggies'. Tests
are being conducted to see if it could be cocaine or crushed Vicodin, 
the website reports.

There were no obvious signs of the white powder of Sage's body, when he was found dead in his Los Angeles apartment last Friday.

It was earlier reported how huge empty
prescription bottles were found in Sage's bedroom. It is now being 
claimed that '60 gigantic bottles, like the ones in pharmacies,' were 
unearthed, TMZ reports.

Part of the investigation is finding 
out how Sage got hold of such a large quantity of prescription 
medication - which included Hydrocodone, generic Vicodin - a 
prescription medication used to treat moderate to severe pain, but which
is also used as a recreational drug.

The news comes as Sage's father 
Sylvester Stallone hired a private investigator to discover exactly what
happened to his late son.

According to TMZ,
the actor, 66, has met with top P.I. Scott Ross in an effort to 
understand what led to the tragic death of Sage Stallone last week.

The website reports that Ross was 
called to Stallone's home to discuss the investigation with the actor, 
his brother Frank and an L.A. County Coroner representative.

Ross was behind the probes into the Chris Brown/Rihanna battery case and Michael Jackson molestation case.

While
it is widely believed that Sage, who was 36, overdosed on painkillers 
following dental surgery, Stallone wants to know if he was using drugs 
or drinking alcohol in the lead up to his death, it is claimed.

According to TMZ, Ross has a history of working with Stallone and is a trusted friend.

Sage
was found dead in his home last Friday night, with bottles of pills 
scattered all over his room, the L.A. County Coroner reported.

Toxicology results are expected within four to six weeks.

Yesterday,
Sage's mother Sasha Czak revealed her belief that he had accidentally 
overdosed on pain medication following extensive dental work.

In
her first public comments on her son Sage's death, Czak said she had 
begged him not to have so much dental work carried out in one day.

She said her son had five teeth extracted two weeks before he was found dead at his Hollywood home last Friday.

Czak, Stallone's first wife, said she had warned her son about having so much dental work carried out in one sitting.

'I
told him not to do that. I've heard about people dying having multiple 
procedures done to you mouth. Do not have more than one tooth (pulled),'
she told the New York Post.

When asked if her son would be taking pain medication, she added: 'Wouldn't you be.'

Hollywood
star Stallone who is said to be grief stricken by Sage’s death released
an emotional statement talking about  his 'agonising' loss.

He said: 'When a parent loses a child there is no greater pain... This agonizing loss will be felt for the rest of our lives.

'Sage
was our first child and the centre of our universe and I am humbly 
begging for all to have my son's memory in full left in peace.'

Los Angeles coroner Ed Winter has denied reports that Sage was living in squalor when his body was found.

One report said he was surrounded by rubbish and cigarette butts and had become a recluse.

'Sage
Stallone wasn't living in squalor. His home wasn't unordinarily messy. 
It seemed to be a typical male messiness. Mr. Stallone did have a 
housekeeper,' Winter told website Radaronline.

Although foul play is not suspected Los Angeles detectives are helping out in the investigation.

Sage’s lawyer has said he was planning to get married and was not depressed.
