FIFA president Sepp Blatter has delivered a considerable snub to the BBC by turning down the opportunity to join a televised debate with his three challengers before the election in Zurich on May 29.

Blatter was always expected to refuse the request, put to him in a letter from the BBC and Sky, for an hour-long debate with Prince Ali of Jordan, Luis Figo and Michael van Praag about their plans for leading FIFA.

The event would have been hosted by top broadcasters from the two networks and given equal prominence to each candidate.

But rather than give a courteous answer by letter to the prominent TV stations, Blatter relayed the curt reply ‘thanks but no thanks’ via one of his flunkeys in a telephone call.

This didn’t impress the BBC, who have been FIFA partners as World Cup rights-holders since proper live coverage started in 1966.

Blatter’s three challengers replied by letter that they would be happy to participate. But the whole project depended on Blatter and he is not even prepared to outline his reasons for not taking part, let alone have his make-up applied for the TV cameras — in front of which he would have by far the most to lose.

Far better for Blatter is to fast-track FIFA Goal Programme funding to African countries, where he enjoys mass voting support.

Boxing promoter Barry McGuigan is in positive talks with ITV about super bantamweight Carl Frampton making his second world title defence on terrestrial TV. Frampton’s win over Chris Avalos in Belfast’s Odyssey Arena last month had far more impact because it was on free-to-air television. ITV say their plans for screening boxing are on a fight-by-fight basis.

The Premier League have caused plenty of angst for the FA by flexing their financial muscle during power battles. However the FA, who have the power of veto as the 21st shareholder in the PL, will not object to CEO Richard Scudamore becoming executive chairman and the governance statute changes that will trigger.

Sport England, who fund grassroots sport, make no secret that they are hugely influenced by the participation findings of the Active People Survey when doling out cash. So it’s difficult to see how swimming, who shed 245,000 participants last year according to the latest APS figures, can avoid having funds diverted from the national governing body when the allocations are announced on Thursday.

County reject’s Oz ton

At least one English cricketer can hold his head high in Australia after the humiliating World Cup exit. Unheralded 25-year-old Charlie Hemphrey, a failed product of the county system with Kent, Derbyshire and Essex, became the first Englishman to score a century in the Sheffield Shield for 37 years with his 118 during Queensland’s win over South Australia. Hemphrey, plucked from grade cricket after emigrating 18 months ago, made his state debut last month.

UK Sport have conducted a widespread consultation on their policy of funding only sports with Olympic medal potential and showing zero tolerance to the rest. And it’s understood the outcome will be ‘business as usual’ on the road to Tokyo 2020 and beyond. The only real change will be more flexibility for team sports, where each medal gained involves a lot more personnel.

Jim Rodwell, a breath of fresh air on the Football League board and FA International Committee as a former player, has made the surprising decision to switch from Notts County chief executive to League One rivals Scunthorpe. Although Scunthorpe have a wealthier backer in chairman Peter Swann, it doesn’t seem much of a promotion for the ambitious Rodwell.

Rio Ferdinand, due to retire from football at the end of a disappointing season with relegation-bound QPR, is expected to be involved in the Champions League next season as a pundit for BT Sport. Ferdinand will be alongside former Manchester United team-mate Paul Scholes, with Gary Lineker lined up to present the coverage.
