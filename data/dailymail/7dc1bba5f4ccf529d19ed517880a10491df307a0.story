Out with a wave and a whimper they went. Out without the slightest echo of Fabio Capello raging against the injustice of a disallowed goal.

Or the sense of crushing disappointment following the penalties against Portugal that marked the end of Sven Goran Eriksson’s tenure and prompted David Beckham to quit the England captaincy in tears.

During a spell in charge that almost now feels like a golden era for the England team, Eriksson had even led Brazil at the quarter-final stage four years earlier, only to then lose to a Ronaldinho lob that had David Seaman blubbing, too.

Four years prior to that and it was Argentina on penalties, but only after that marvellous Michael Owen goal and the drama of Beckham’s dismissal. It was petulant. It had Glenn Hoddle raging at a young player for undermining what had been a fine England performance.

But at least England went down fighting. At least they played with a bit of style and vigour.

Here? There was nothing like that. There was just this sense of meek surrender. A sense that England had come to the greatest World Cup in history and pretty much stunk the place out.

Roy Hodgson tried to give this encounter with Costa Rica some meaning, standing as he did in the dug-out for the entire match. He certainly acted as if it mattered.

But if this was the first step towards a brighter future, the first step away from the nadir that was defeat by Uruguay, then why end the game with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in midfield? Greg Dyke, misguided though he was in the timing of his comments, said these matches here in Brazil would prove valuable experience for Euro 2016.

Time old conundrum: England ended up with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard in midfield

But what value, beyond sentiment, could there be in reuniting Gerrard and Lampard for 17 minutes when their failure to operate effectively as a partnership has been a source of frustration for more than a decade?

‘We need to improve, otherwise we would not be going home,’ said Lampard afterwards. ‘It is about the future and looking for them to get better.’ Well, quite.

Hodgson may take comfort in the reception he and his players received from England’s fans at the end. But he shouldn’t kid himself into thinking it was an acceptance of failure. It was actually rather surreal; a response, you suspect, driven almost by pity.

Nobody can claim it was anything other than a pitiful effort over the three matches, with this performance providing further evidence that Hodgson fails as an international manager where others succeed.

Louis van Gaal turned a dodgy Dutch defence against Australia into a superbly disciplined one against Chile. Here, England still looked vulnerable to long balls.

Lampard seized on the positives. ‘It was amazing,’ he said of the reception they received at the end from the fans. ‘They were singing for the manager. It made you proud to be an Englishman. It makes you feel a bit bad we have not given them a longer stay.’

Lampard also said such support would help the younger players in the future. But they need more than that. They need leadership and guidance and a clear vision of how they should play.

They need to know that this will never happen again. That the people in charge, the people in the highest offices at the FA, implement the changes to make damn sure it doesn’t happen again. Whether they will, of course, is another question entirely.
