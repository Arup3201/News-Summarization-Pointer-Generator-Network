This is the 'invisible bomb' maker described by US officials as 'an evil genius' who could be a key player in looming air terror threats to the UK and America.

Chemistry student Ibrahim Al-Asiri, from Saudi Arabia, allegedly created devices that can be sewn inside the human body - and are virtually undetectable at airport security.

It's these 'stealth' bombs which have sparked a worldwide airport security alert

The master explosives-maker first tried out his chilling tactics on his willing younger brother, Abdullah. Though the 22-year-old was killed, he did not hit his target.

Alert: Families face a summer of travel chaos following a security alert over bombs that cannot be detected by airport scanners - and could face secondary checks at departure gates

Families face a summer of travel chaos following a security alert over bombs that cannot be detected by airport scanners.

Intelligence sources fear Al Qaeda is plotting to smuggle the devices on to planes travelling between  Britain and America.

The explosives, which have no metal parts, could be hidden in clothes or surgically implanted inside a suicide bomber.

The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq. It is feared they will return to target flights leaving the UK. 

The alert led to the number of sophisticated body scanners at British airports being raised from ten to 21 yesterday.

At Manchester, extra machines were sent to departure gates on transatlantic flights to allow staff to swab hand luggage at boarding as well as at security. Electronic devices and footwear are being subjected to greater scrutiny.

The measures are likely to lead to delays during the summer holidays when Heathrow alone has 200,000 passengers a day.

David Cameron insisted yesterday that safety comes first. ‘This is something we’ve discussed with the Americans and what we have done is put in place some extra precautions and extra checks,’ said the Prime Minister.

‘The safety of the travelling public must come first. We must not take any risks with that. I hope this won’t lead to unnecessary delays but it’s very important that we always put safety first, and we do.’

Airports last night insisted planes would not be delayed – but passengers may have to arrive at gates earlier to go through the new procedures. It has also been suggested that ‘sky marshals’ – undercover armed police – could be brought in on some routes.

US security blogger Lisa Simeone said security staff at Heathrow were carrying out ‘vigorous’ physical searches, as well as extra tests for explosives, similar to those in America. ‘There was also a lot of swabbing going on, people’s belongings, their clothes and shoes, they even swabbed a baby’s pushchair,’ she said.

‘People were being checked for iPhones and things like that, but the biggest difference was in the physical checking of people’s bodies.’

Delayed: The new measures are likely to lead to longer queues, delays and increased checks at airports, as well as an influx of sky marshals on some transatlantic routes

Eryk 
Salvaggio, a student, said: ‘The security guys were paying a lot of 
attention to everyone’s bags and items as they went through the 
scanners. It seemed to take twice as long for each bag to go through, 
I’ve never seen it done like that and I have travelled a lot.

‘There were a lot of bags being taken aside too, when they came out the other side, for extra searches.’

A US Department of Homeland Security official would only say the measures were a response to a ‘real time, credible’ threat.

For
 the past five years jihadists in Yemen have been working on 
‘artfully-concealed devices’ – explosives that contain no metal and emit
 only a faint vapour and can be disguised inside items such as shoes, 
soft drink bottles and clothing. Intelligence points to bombmakers from 
the group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and tutored by Al-Asiri.

The
 official UK threat status remains unchanged at ‘substantial’, the third
 grade in a five-level rating. A Department for Transport spokesman 
said: ‘We have taken the decision to step up some of our aviation 
security measures. For obvious reasons, we will not be commenting in 
detail on those changes.

‘The majority of passengers should not experience significant disruption.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg cautioned that the new checks were unlikely to be ‘a one-off, temporary thing’.

‘This is the world we now live in,’ he said. ‘I don’t want people to think that this is some sort of blip for a week.

'This is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks in our airports – and indeed other places of entry and exits from countries – keep up with what we know from intelligence and other sources about the nature of the threats we face.’

The tightening of security came as a message was posted on a Twitter page purporting to be that of a British jihadi in Iraq, saying the UK was ‘afraid’ he might come back with skills he had learned fighting with terror group ISIS.

The message was posted yesterday on an account believed to belong to Nasser Muthana, from Cardiff, who appeared in an ISIS propaganda video last week. He tweeted alongside a picture of makeshift bombs.
