This is the shocking moment a man mugged a 90-year-old pensioner for her handbag while high on a legal drug called 'Clockwork Orange'.

CCTV footage showed Sheldon Woodford, 24, stalking pensioner Betty Aldworth moments before the cowardly attack in Boscombe, near Bournemouth, Dorset, which knocked her to the ground and left her with knee and shoulder injuries.

Drug addict Woodford was later named to police by his ashamed mother after she recognised her son in a police appeal on Facebook.

He was yesterday jailed for four-and-a-half years at Bournemouth Crown Court after pleading guilty to robbery. 

The court heard that Woodford was addicted to cannabis-like legal high Clockwork Orange, and had nine previous convictions for 26 offences including five robberies. 

Police were called to Michelgrove Road on the morning of December 29 after passers-by saw the OAP lying on the pavement and Woodford running off with her handbag. 

Woodford was chased by witnesses down nearby roads before dropping the bag, which was returned to a shaken Mrs Aldworth.

As police sought to identify the thief, the CCTV footage was circulated and Woodford's own mother shopped him to police.

Detective Constable Leo Glendon, from Bournemouth CID, said Woodford's mother Sharon chose to hand him over to police for the sake of the community's safety.

DC Glendon said she saw the police photo of her son on Facebook and 'felt it right' to come forward.

'Woodford's mother saw the CCTV footage on her Facebook feed and instantly recognised the man in it as her son.

'She felt that any loyalty towards her son was superseded by the fact that he had picked on a vulnerable, elderly lady.

'She felt it was right to come forward and inform us due to the nature of the crime and the fact Woodford was targeting elderly people and could still be a danger to them.

'We received a call from Woodford's mother on January 2 during which she said "That's my son".

'She wanted him to be forced to get help and the only way that was going to be possible is if he was put behind bars. 

Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court how a passing van driver, Robert Edwards, had seen the attack and chased Woodford into the grounds of a nearby hotel.

She said Mr Edwards saw the defendant drop the handbag so he went to check on Mrs Aldworth, leaving two other passersby to monitor Woodford. 

The attack occurred on Michelgrove Road, Bournemouth (pictured), while 90-year-old Mrs Aldworth was making her way home from the shops

Les Smith, mitigating, said Woodford had been high at the time of the incident and was ashamed of his actions.

He said Woodford had moved back to Bournemouth from the home he shared with his partner and baby in Chippenham, Wiltshire, after becoming overwhelmed by his role as a father.

He said: 'He was tearful at the incident, he was tearful at the police station, he was tearful to the probation officer and he was tearful in conference.

'In the words of his own mother, it all got too much for him. He came back to Bournemouth to live with a friend who had been released from prison and both descended into further drug misuse.'

Judge Peter Johnson described Woodford's crime as 'a cowardly, despicable act'.

He said: 'That injury is still causing her pain. The sentence of this court must be a severe one.'
