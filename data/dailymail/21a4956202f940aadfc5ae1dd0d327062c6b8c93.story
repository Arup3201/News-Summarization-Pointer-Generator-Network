Police have launched an investigation after an officer was photographed asleep while on duty.

The image, which has appeared on Facebook and Twitter, shows the officer apparently enjoying a snooze while his patrol car is parked near a gym in Wigan.

It is believed to have been taken on May 1 by a disgruntled member of the public before being posted online.

A caption reads: 'Why is this policeman asleep at 6.21am outside the DW Gym in Wigan on 1st May 2013?????? Must be no crime about!!!! Share and shame him!!!!!'

A probe has now been launched by Greater Manchester Police.

A GMP spokesperson said its professional standards branch was looking into the incident and enquiries were ongoing.

It is the second time in two months the force has been left red-faced by a photograph of an officer asleep on the job.

Embarrassing: Greater Manchester Police is investigating after the force was alerted to the photograph

In March, an image of a 26-year-old constable appeared on Facebook showing him slumped on black sofa in his uniform and with his eyes closed.

The image was taken by a colleague after they were called to an incident in Salford.

A caption underneath named the officer with 'expert scene management' inserted as his middle name.

Another officer later added: 'This picture doesn't quite capture the snoring.'
