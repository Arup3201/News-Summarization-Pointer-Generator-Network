The mother of the owners of the controversial Latvian website linked to the recent suicide of British teenager Hannah Smith has hit out at her grieving parents, blaming them for the tragic death of their daughter.

The 14-year-old schoolgirl hanged herself in her Leicestershire bedroom nine days ago, after being bullied relentlessly by internet trolls via her page on the popular website ask.fm.

She is the latest of five similar deaths which have all been linked to the social network.

Hannah Smith, 14, hanged herself in her Leicestershire bedroom nine days ago, after being bullied relentlessly by internet trolls via her page on the popular website ask.fm

Last week, the website’s founders, wealthy Latvian start-up entrepreneurs Ilja and Mark Terebin, aged 34 and 29, came under fire from relatives of Hannah and the other dead teenage users, provoking advertisers to boycott ask.fm and Prime Minister David Cameron to urge parents to stop their teenagers from using the site, which attracts 60 million users.

But now the mother and father of the Soviet-born brothers have hit back, denying that their sons are in any way culpable and instead blaming the parents of suicide victims for failing to police their use  of the internet.

Ludmila Terebin,  a cosmetologist whose sons have become web millionaires from the site launched in 2010, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I heard about this suicide case in the UK but I do not understand why my sons are to blame.

‘What are they guilty of? I think we'd better look instead at the parents of these teenagers and at the way they brought them up,’ she added defiantly in her first comment on Hannah’s death and the string of teenage suicides linked to ask.fm.

‘Of course, I sympathise with them. It is awful to lose your child like  this but, I’m sorry, it is all to do with how you raise them.

‘I am a mother and I would be worried if my child stayed online a lot. But I do not understand why my sons are being blamed for this.’

Told that a key feature of ask.fm  is the alleged anonymity it gives  web bullies, which critics claim her sons failed to address, despite earlier suicides, she said: ‘Sorry, but I understand very little about how these social networks work. I don’t like using social networks.

Row: Ask.fm has said previously it does not take responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts

‘I do not know who is anonymous there and who is not, you better  ask my sons.’ She insisted: ‘I believe they do worry about this, too.’

Though her close-knit family has become wealthy – with several homes in the country’s upscale white-sand Baltic resort of Jurmala, where prices are on a par with southern England, while her sons own penthouses in the capital Riga – she  said: ‘This ask.fm project belongs to my sons but I don’t use it. I prefer face-to-face communication, as we had before.’

Meanwhile, her husband, former Red Army soldier Oleg Terebin, 57, when asked about Hannah’s suicide, replied: ‘You know what people say – 99 per cent of people who eat cucumbers eventually die.’

His attempt at a joke, along with his wife’s remarks, are certain to cause hurt for relatives of teenagers who took their lives after using ask.fm.

They will also be a setback to the ask.fm crisis management exercise launched by the brothers, involving top-end public relations specialists in Britain and the US.

Last week this led to an ‘open letter’ in which the owners called Hannah’s death a ‘true tragedy’, and a vow that ask.fm is co-operating with police over her death and has the technical ability to unmask her cyber bullies  to the police, plus a commitment ‘to improve our site and its safety features’ to ‘ensure our users and their parents do not lose confidence in our social network’.

They also appointed top London legal firm Mishcon de Reya to conduct ‘a full and independent audit  of our site and its safety features’ amid claims the site has been ‘maligned’ by unfair criticism.

The brothers – who refuse to give interviews and remained hidden from view last week – said they  were ‘committed to safeguarding against bullying and harassment in all forms’.

However, there will be fears the family’s true views are expressed  by their parents.

Mr Terebin refused to say if he would advise his sons to alter the controls to protect young people.  ‘I haven’t talked to them yet. I’m  out of the country and have a lot of work on. I am solving some problems,’ he said.

Asked if his sons’ failure to tighten controls after earlier suicides was because of the profits they raked in, he said: ‘No, this is not true. I know my boys. Look, there are a lot of other social networks. What guarantees do they give?’

Mr Terebin echoed his wife, declaring: ‘My children did what they wanted when they were young. But you can always stop using the social network if you feel uncomfortable.’

As the Terebin parents’ spoke, details emerged of the real views  of the brothers – who boast glamorous girlfriends and drive expensive cars – which may shock many ask.fm users.

Mark has dismissed gays as ‘these fools’ on his ask.fm page, while Ilja has stated: ‘I would not lie next to a homosexual even in the morgue.’

He is also on record as wanting to bring back a Stalinist law banning homosexuality and has shockingly written: ‘I feel good about cannibals. I do not see a big difference between eating pig, cow or human flesh.’

The family of patriarch Mr Terebin came to Latvia after Stalin subjugated the country following the Second World War.

Expressing loyalty to the USSR,  Mr Terebin said he can never forget ‘to whom I gave the oath’, slamming ‘narrow-minded’ Mikhail Gorbachev and ‘drunkard’ Boris Yeltsin for destroying Soviet might.

He and his wife were pushy parents who demanded academic excellence from their sons. Both boys shone at school before graduating from the International Business University in Riga.
