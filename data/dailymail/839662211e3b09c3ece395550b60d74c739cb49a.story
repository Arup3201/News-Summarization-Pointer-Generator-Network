He is  Australia's most notorious and well recognised criminal, but Ned Kelly may never have even existed if it weren't for his father stealing two pigs more than 170 years ago.

Public records published on Findmypast.com on Friday trace Ned Kelly's path from before his father John Kelly  became a criminal in Ireland to years later when he would eventually do the same in Australia.

Prison transfer records show John Kelly, also known as Red, was arrested for stealing two pigs back in 1841 and sent to Australia as a convict.

It was just a few years before The Great Famine in Ireland, which wiped out approximately 25 percent of the population due to mass starvation, according to Vicki Dawson from Findmypast.

'The area was hit quite hard by the famine between 1845 and 1852. He was transported a few years before it hit, so he may not have even survived if he hadn't stolen the pigs,' Ms Dawson said.

'If he hadn't come here, Ned Kelly may not have been born.'

The move would become etched in Australia's history with his son Ned set to become the nation's most iconic criminal.

'His father was given his certificate of freedom and moved to Melbourne where he met Ned's mother,' Ms Dawson said.

He eloped with Ellen Quinn and they settled in the Victorian ranges north of Melbourne where he stole horses to supplement his income.

The couple had seven children, including Ned, before he was arrested and jailed again.

He died before finishing his sentence in 1866.

Ned Kelly's notorious criminal history is well known and Findmypast has a range of different records to back it up, according to Ms Dawson.

They have published his first mugshot, prison register and his father's records online in time for St Patrick's Day next week.

Kelly and his gang, known for their armour protection, were shot in 1880 at Glenrowan, Victoria

'There's descriptions on scars, eye colour - it's very detailed. Then you can look through transportation records and you can look back at his grandfather's evaluation records,' she said.

'With Ned Kelly we trace him right back to his great grandparents. Land records, census, criminal records - there's a huge amount of records to use to trace back Irish ancestry.

Findmypast has 90 million Irish and migration records available online - the largest of any kind in the world, according to Ms Dawson.

While the records can uncover details on some of the country's most recognised Australians with Irish blood, anyone with Irish ancestry can easily search for historical records to uncover how their relatives lived, she said.
