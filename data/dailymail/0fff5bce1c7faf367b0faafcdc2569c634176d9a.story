Queensland Police have set up the G20 Taskforce which is responsible for the overall planning and coordination of the security.

Under the G20 Act, that passed in October last year, there are areas that will be restricted for a set period of time.

There are also declared areas, the invisible barrier directly buffering the restricted areas where people can still have access to but will be controlled.

Police will be closing lanes and roads within the declared area to allow motorcades to travel between the Brisbane Airport and the accommodation and meeting venues.

For most people in Brisbane it will be business as usual over the long weekend, however people living, working or travelling across the CBD and South Brisbane can expect significant changes to traffic and transport network.

Their advice, plan ahead, consider your need to travel and allow extra time.

Queensland Police will also be keeping a close eye on protestors and while they respect the rights of citizens to protest lawfully they won't tolerate bad behaviour.

'We will not tolerate any unlawful behaviour which threatens the safety and security of the communities in Brisbane or Cairns, or actions that pose a risk to the safety and dignity of those attending G20 related activities.'
