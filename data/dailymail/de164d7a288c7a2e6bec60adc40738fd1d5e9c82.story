Teenager Lucie Low is doubled over in agonising pain every day after being diagnosed with a rare digestive disorder

Doubled over in pain, teenager Lucie Low suffers pain so agonising it feels as though she is in labour.

But the 13-year-old is not expecting a baby.

When she first went to see doctors, they put her pain down to constipation.

But Lucie is not constipated.

After enduring months of agony, Lucie was admitted to hospital last month.

There doctors discovered she was suffering from a rare digestive disorder.  

The condition, superior mesenteric arterial syndrome, is caused when the duodenum - part of the small intestine - is compressed between two arteries, which can cause it to become blocked.

Such is the rarity of the illness, that Lucie's local NHS hospital are struggling to find a specialist to treat the teenager.

After six weeks of watching her daughter battle the pain, Lucie's mother Zoe is today trying to raise enough money to pay for a private specialist.

The 36-year-old, said: 'Lucie is in pain 24/7. She is so distressed. She is crying and screaming out my name.

'The only way to describe it is like she is in labour, she is doubled over.

'I have had to see my beautiful 13-year-old daughter go from being a normal teenage girl to not being able to get out of bed.  

'She usually loves school and she really misses her friends. She is a real bookworm but she isn't even able to read because she is in so much pain.'

In a video uploaded to a fundraising page, Lucie whimpers in pain and says 'I can't take it no more' and later 'I can't take it mummy'.

The mother-of-two, added: 'I feel helpless, I'm desperate for her to get the help she needs. I set up a page on Facebook as a last resort, just to see if I could get any help.

'I have spoken to so many consultants and been to the patient advice and liaison service and the nurses are doing everything they can but it is not getting us anywhere.'

Lucie, from Rainham, Kent, began suffering stomach problems last August when she started getting pain every time she ate.

The pain got worse from October and she lost more than two stone in weight.

Doctors initially diagnosed constipation and sent her home before she was eventually admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital for tests.

Lucie went there for an exploratory procedure and was told she would be there for two days, but she ended up 'doubled over in pain' and stayed for 10 days.

She was then transferred to Medway Maritime Hospital and has been on the children's ward since - apart from a couple of days earlier this month when she was well enough to go home.

Zoe says Lucie is only being given pain relief and the hospital do not have the specialists needed to treat her.

Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare condition.

It occurs when the duodenum - part of the small intestine - is compressed between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery.

The compression causes the duodenum to become blocked, which causes acute pain.

It is known to be a complication of scoliosis surgery, anorexia, and trauma.

Doctors have contacted a number of other hospitals but so far not found Lucie the help she needs. 

Ms Low said doctors at GOSH are waiting for the results of some more tests, adding she is 'frustrated' by the delay. 

She added: 'She has been in this level of pain for about 18 days now and it is constant, 24 hours a day. 

'I originally set up the Facebook page to find help. It wasn't about money, I just got desperate and wanted somebody to help treat her.' 

A Medway Maritime Hospital spokesman said they are doing all they can for the family.

He said: 'The paediatric team at Medway Maritime Hospital are doing everything possible to care for Lucie and to support her family.

'Unfortunately, we are unable to discuss individual patient cases, so cannot provide any further comment at this stage.'

In just 24 hours Lucie's family and friends have raised more than £2,000.
