A child has been killed and another four have been injured after a dump truck collided with a school bus carrying elementary school students in southwest Idaho.

Daniel Robert Cook, 11, died of blunt force trauma in the crash, Canyon County Coroner Vicki DeGeus-Morris said.

Twelve children in the sixth grade or younger were on board the bus destined for Crimson Point Elementary School in Kuna when it was hit at an intersection just before 8am on Thursday.

Four children were taken to the hospital with injuries, and the bus driver was taken to a hospital for emotional distress. Authorities have not released the names or ages of the other victims.

Wreck: The dump truck did not have a stop sign on its road but the school bus driver did have one on hers

Joshua Schlaich, a spokesman for St. Alphonsus Regional Medical Center, said he could not release the conditions of the children.

Adam Cobb, whose son was friends with Daniel Cook, was at the crash site Thursday to collect the deceased boy's belongings for the family. Cobb's son wasn't among the kids on the bus.

'It's a terrible loss not only for the family but for the community,' Cobb said. 'Daniel loved to wrestle and play football. He was just the kind of kid you'd want at your home. We love him â€” he was just a good boy.'

Cobb, who lives nearby, said he heard the ambulances racing to the crash scene as he was getting ready for work.

Sadness: Family friend Adam Cobb arrived on the scene to collect the boy's belongings. He said Daniel 'was just the kind of kid you'd want at your home. He was just a good boy'

Scene: Authorities swarm the scene after the deadly crash occurred just before 8am on Thursday

Probe: Law enforcement officials investigate the scene of the crash and will continue throughout the day

'I
came upon it and it was already done,' he said. 'I just came back to 
make sure that there wasn't anything left, a backpack or something.'

Daniel Cook also lived nearby and would only have been on the bus a few minutes before the crash, Cobb said.

The collision occurred at an intersection on a two-lane country road lined by homes and farm fields between Nampa and Kuna.

Authorities
say the dump truck was traveling north on Happy Valley Road, when the 
driver approached the four-way intersection with no stop sign for that 
road.

The bus was traveling east on the intersecting road, which did have a stop sign.

Idaho State Police Sgt. John Burke said it's too early to determine what went wrong.

Destination: The bus was heading to Crimson Point Elementary School in Kuna when it was hit

'We can't really speculate. We need to gather more information and continue the investigation,' Burke said.

Emergency
crews are still responding to the scene and roads are expected to be 
closed throughout the day. Some families were at the scene while others 
were meeting their children at the school.

'It's
a horrible ... it's a terrible thing,' Burke said. 'The family (of the 
deceased child) is devastated. They need our prayers and all we can do 
is hope they can get through it.'

Idaho Department of Education Spokeswoman Melissa McGrath said the Kuna School District runs its own bussing operation, meaning it buys the vehicles and hires its own drivers.

The last time a student died in a bus crash in Idaho was in Boise in 1969, she said.
