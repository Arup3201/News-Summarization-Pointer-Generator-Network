ITV Sport will not show commercials during the drinks breaks which will occur during a number of World Cup matches.

FIFA gave broadcasters the option of advertising during the cooling periods, which will be decided on a match-by-match basis by the venue medical officer if the temperature exceeds 32°C.

But ITV, despite the potential advertising riches, wanted to keep their broadcasts focused on the game, which was felt to be in the best interests of viewers. Each break, should it be enforced, will last three minutes.

FIFA gave the go-ahead in February to Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's proposal for water breaks after his experiences at the Confederations Cup in Brazil last summer.

After the draw in December saw England land matches in some of Brazil's hotter areas, Roy Hodgson supported the calls for the mid-half rest periods as he did in USA 1994 when he was manager of the Switzerland team.

England's opening game against Italy in the jungle city of Manaus will likely feature water breaks but will be advert-free as it is being shown by the BBC.

England's games against Uruguay in Sao Paulo and Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte are being broadcast by ITV but temperatures at both are expected to be below the threshold.
