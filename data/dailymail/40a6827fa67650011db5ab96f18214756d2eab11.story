Footage of Paula Deen openly admitting to using the N-word will probably never see the light of day after a judge blocked the incriminating video's release.

In the deposition  tape, the disgraced celebrity chef says 'yes of course' she used the N-word in the past, sparking the firestorm that has destroyed her reputation and cost her millions.

According to TMZ, Deen was terrified the ex-employee accusing her of promoting a racist and sexist work environment in a $1.2 million lawsuit would leak the video to the media.

As such, she filed court documents last week asking the judge to block the 'colourful' video.

The small victory comes after Deen 
fired her entire legal team in the ongoing fallout from the racial slurs
scandal that have sunk her career.

According to court documents, Deen has replaced Savannah-based firm Oliver Maner with Grace Speights, a Washington, D.C.-based partner in Morgan, Lewis & Bockius' Labor and Employment practice.

Grace Speights is considered something of a pioneer as the first African-American woman to become a partner at her law firm.

She has also been a keynote speaker at the Attorneys of Color Conference. The hiring could be seen by a cynical move by Deen who is keen to point out she is not a racist after her recent troubles.

‘She and her team decided the previous attorneys were out of their depth,’ a source close to the Deen family told People.

Deen has assembled a new legal team of acclaimed 'heavy hitters' that also includes Patricia Glaser, one of the country's top entertainment lawyers, and Savannah-based Harvey Weitz.

Glaser earned a reputation as a 'tough, take-no-prisoners litigator' after securing a $32.5 million payout from NBC for Conan O'Brien for the remainder of his 'The Tonight Show' contract in 2010.

The new 'All Stars' legal team will be charged with defending Deen 
against the lawsuit filed by Lisa Jackson, a former manager of 
Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, owned by the chef with her 
brother Bubba Hiers.

What started out as the defense of a civil lawsuit has turned into an operation to try and salvage what's left of Deen's business empire after she lost a host of major sponsors and her slot on the Food Network

It was in a legal deposition connected with the case that Deen admitted under oath to having used the N-word.

Since then she has suffered a dramatic fall from grace and her earnings have crumbled following the departure of major sponsors including Target and Walmart.

Securing a victory in the upcoming civil action against Jackson will be imperative to rebuilding Deen's public brand. Since the scandal broke, she has been working with reputation expert Judy Smith, the inspiration behind 
the Olivia Pope character in ABC's hit drama Scandal.

Last week Deen split with longtime agent Barry Weiner, who had helped make her a star.

Deen had worked with Weiner for more than a decade. She 
has said he was instrumental in getting her show 'Paula's Home Cooking' on the 
Food Network in 2002.

'Paula Deen has separated from her agent,' Deen's spokeswoman, Elana Weiss, 
said in a prepared statement. 'She and her family thank him for the tireless effort 
and dedication over the many years.'

After the N-word scandal, the Food Network passed on renewing Deen's contract and yanked her shows off 
the air.

Smithfield Foods, the pork producer that paid Deen as a celebrity 
endorser, dropped her soon after.

Retailers including Walmart and Target quickly announced that they would no longer sell Deen's products and publisher Ballantine scuttled plans 
for an upcoming cookbook even when it was the No. 1 seller on Amazon.

Even 
the diabetes drug company that made the much-criticized deal to hire Deen as a 
paid spokeswoman dumped her.

Weiner had worked to turn Deen into a comfort-food queen since she was little 
more than a Savannah restaurant owner and self-publisher of cookbooks who earned 
raves for her fried chicken.

In her book 'Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cookin,' Deen recalled 
meeting Weiner through TV producer Gordon Elliott, who was convinced they could 
turn her into a star.

'Barry and Gordon felt like there was a show somewhere inside this Paula 
character that could be very successful,' Deen wrote. 'They probably courted 
Food Network for two years trying to push me at them.'

Deen also noted in her book: 'Barry is affectionately known in my family as 
Barry Cuda. Perfect name for an agent.'

The chef's business deals began falling apart after she was questioned under oath 
in May as part of a civil lawsuit filed last year by Lisa Jackson, a former 
manager of Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, which Deen co-owns with her 
brother, Bubba Hiers.

Jackson says she was sexually harassed and worked in an 
environment rife with racial slurs and innuendo.

Ultimately it was Deen's own words that proved damaging. Asked in her 
deposition if she had ever used the N-word, she replied: 'Yes, of course.'

That 
she also insisted 'it's been a very long time' seemed to matter little to the 
companies paying to use her name and image with their products.

Neither were 
they swayed by Deen's apologies in online videos and in person with the 'Today' 
show's Matt Lauer.

Forbes magazine last year ranked Deen as the fourth-highest-earning celebrity 
chef last year, figuring she had hauled in $17 million.

Her company Paula Deen 
Enterprises generates total annual revenue of nearly $100 million, according to 
Burt Flickinger III, president of retail consultancy Strategic Resource 
Group.

Deen cast no blame in her statement announcing her split with Weiner. It 
ended by saying, 'Paula wishes him well in all future endeavors.'
