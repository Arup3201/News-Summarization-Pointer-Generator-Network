Beth Prout has been denied potentially life-saving treatment for a rare stomach lining cancer

A Welsh nurse has been forced to wait for potentially life-saving treatment after local health bosses refused to fund her care in England.

Beth Prout, from Pembroke, West Wales, has been diagnosed with a rare form of stomach cancer.

There are two hospitals in the UK able to provide the treatment the 57-year-old needs.

But NHS chiefs in Wales have refused to cover the cost of sending her to England for therapy.

A hospital in Manchester has agreed to provide the care, which could save Ms Prout's life. 

Welsh NHS bosses have agreed to pay £1,000 for an assessment, but are 'awaiting further clinical information' before reviewing her case. 

The mother-of-two said: 'If I lived in England I'd be in hospital now.

'I've worked all my life and paid taxes to central government. Because I live in Wales I've been treated as a second-class citizen.

'You hear about a postcode lottery, with people not getting treatment because of where they live. I'm fighting this for them too.'

The single mother is battling a rare form of cancer in her stomach lining and needs specialist treatment.

The Christie Hospital in Manchester has agreed to assess and treat her.

Ms Prout is now battling with a health committee of the Welsh NHS to try and get funding after bosses refused to send her to Manchester in August.

She has gone to her local MP, Simon Hart, who is helping her challenge the Welsh NHS ruling.

Mr Hart asked the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee (WHSSC) to reconsider their decision, and earlier this month Ms Prout's doctor appealed on her behalf, branding the decision 'unethical'. 

Mr Hart said: 'I'm shocked and saddened by what is happening to Beth and others refused treatment by NHS Wales, which would be available if they lived in England.'

Responsibility for health care in Wales was passed to the Welsh Government under devolution in 1999.  

In England, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are responsible for deciding on which specific care services are needed in each local area.

In Wales, that responsibility falls to seven Local Health Boards (LHBs). Each LHB is responsible for delivering all NHS healthcare services in its geographical area.

Due to this structure, a so-called 'postcode lottery' has emerged, whereby local decision-making and budgets determine the allocation of healthcare services.

Ms Prout, pictured with her daugther Kate Prout, soon to be daughter-in-law Samantha Ward, and granddaughter Isla Morgan, has been accepted for treatment at a Manchester hospital but was told the NHS in Wales would not cover the £7,000 cost across the border

It means access to cancer drugs, for example, is restricted in some areas, while patients living in neighbouring health authorities  - such as even a few miles away over the border in England - are able to be prescribed the same treatment on the NHS. 

The Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee has said it will now pay the £1,000 cost for Ms Prout to have an assessment. 

A spokesman said: 'We are currently awaiting further clinical information on this case so that it can be considered by the all-Wales Individual Patient Funding Request Panel (IPFR panel) which makes decisions on such cases. 

'In this particular case it has already been agreed that a clinical assessment will be funded in order to understand if the peritoneal disease can be managed by CRS and HIPEC. 

'Once there is a clear clinical judgement, then the IPFR panel will be able to make a clinical decision on the best way forward for this individual.'  

Last week it emerged multiple sclerosis patient Phil Grace is being forced to pay £450 a month for a drug which helps him stand and walk.

The treatment is prescribed free of charge on the NHS in other parts of the country.

Mr Grace, who lives in Great Tey, Essex, was diagnosed with MS in 2000 after suffering symptoms since his mid-20s.

Constant muscle spasms left the 59-year-old unable to sleep at night and relying on a stick to walk.

But his life was transformed when he found a drug on the internet, used by other MS sufferers.

Phil Grace, 59, from Great Tey in Essex said he has been forced to spend £450-a-month on a cannabis-based drug that helps him walk and stand up after his local Clinical Commissioning Group refused to fund the treatment despite it being available in other parts of the UK free of charge

The cannabis-based drug Sativex controls Mr Grace's muscle spasms, enabling him to walk.

He asked his GP if he could be prescribed the drug but was devastated when the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which commissions care for the area, refused to fund it.

Mr Grace said his only option is to pay £450 a month for 11 daily doses of the drug.

He said: 'It is free in some areas and you can get it willy nilly in Wales but my local authority say it is not value for money.

'It is absolutely ludicrous really, they have never looked at the bigger picture.'

A spokesman for the Mid-Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, who denied Mr Grace's funding application, said they may consider handing out Sativex if it is recommended by Nice.

He said: 'Nice is currently reviewing its guidelines for the management of multiple sclerosis and is including Sativex in the scope of the consultation.

'The guidelines are due for publication in October after which the CCG will consider any recommendations.

'We do not routinely fund Sativex however patients have the right to be considered for exceptional funding if their GP or consultant feels they meet the criteria.

'A referral can be made to the CCG's exceptional case panel with clinical evidence to support the request.'
