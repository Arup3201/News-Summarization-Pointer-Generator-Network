The British tourist who died after shooting himself at a Thai gun range shared a toffee with the taxi driver taking him there in the moments before his death. 

Liam Colven was behaving 'normally' on the way to the Thalang range on Phuket on Saturday according to the taxi driver who took him there from a friend's hotel. 

The 21-year-old appeared in 'good spirits' and even shared a toffee with Pauseud Pasaman after telling him he was from Scotland. 

After firing six rounds at the range, Mr Colven turned a gun on himself in front of horrified staff members. 

Tragic: The man who shot himself has been identified as Liam Colven who was originally from the Isle of Skye

Horror:  A distressed staff member first tries to stop Mr Colven shooting himself, before wheeling away unable to believe what has just happened

The former hotel worker from Skye has been described by friends as 'one of the kindest men' they'd known. 

Describing the journey to the range from the Sunkiss Hotel in Phuket, Mr Pasaman said he seemed to be behaving normally. 

A receptionist said he appeared to be 'like everybody else' at the hotel but was not registered to a room. 

'He was happy. He did not seem like the kind of man who was about to shoot himself. He was normal. Not drunk,' the 41-year-old told MailOnline from a makeshift taxi rank outside the hotel. 

Despite earlier reports which claimed the former hotel worker had been arguing with a friend, Mr Pasaman said the pair appeared to be having a calm conversation. 

'They talked for around half an hour. Not fighting just talking.'

'They looked like they knew each other.' 

After their encounter, Mr Colven walked the short distance across the road and asked for a taxi.

'He said, "I want to shoot" so I took him there.

The driver said there was 'some talk' during the drive but added that his 'English is not good' and the only thing he remembered was that he was 'from the UK'.

The pair did share a toffee before Mr Pasaman dropped him off at the range. 

Taxi driver Pauseud Pasaman drove the youngster to the shooting range. He said he behaved 'normally'

The British tourist shot himself after emptying one magazine at a target, staff at the Thalang range said

Thai police said Mr Colven was not registered to any hotels in the Bang Tao area but had been seen at a hotel talking to a friend before being picked up by a taxi 

There, the 21-year-old shot himself in the head at around 3pm local time yesterday. 

According to a staf member, he bought one package of six bullets and fired them all off at a target. 

He then asked for three more bullets before turning the gun on himself and firing at point blank range, staff and witnesses told police. 

The youngster's death had left him 'shocked', Mr Pasaman added. He has since been questioned by Thai police over his account. 

'He was a young boy. Twenty one is very young.'

A Thai policeman claimed Mr Colven had not been staying in the Ban Tao area prior to his death and that the young man's belongings had been collected by officers and taken to a the Thalang police station.

He added that Mr Colven had been at the Sunkiss hotel to 'visit a friend'. 

In the video of the incident, the staff member, wearing a light blue shirt, flung the sun hat he was wearing  seconds after the shooting.

Clearly in serious distress immediately following the man's actions, which apparently came without any sort of warning, he gripped the table in shock before walking away with his hands on his head.

The member of staff then fell to the ground and strikes the floor in disbelief as he struggles to process what has just taken place.

He looked back at where the tourist's body is lying slumped on the ground where he fell after discharging the weapon.

MailOnline spoke to a young neighbour of the Thalang range deep in the Phuket countryside (pictured)

A young man living near the shooting range, who did not want to give his name, told MailOnline: 'It is sad. I heard shots and someone scream. 

'The police came and took his body away.'

The range the 21-year-old visited is deep in the Phuket countryside, down a number of rocky byroads and around an hour from the bustling hub of Patong.

The spot is peaceful  at night with plenty of trees around and a tied-up elephant grazing in front.

Lt Kraisorn Boonprasop of the Thalang Police said: 'We have taken statements from some witnesses but we will question more people at the scene and we have yet to review the CCTV footage.' 

Local officials have become increasingly concerned at the number of suicides among expats and tourists visiting Phuket. 

Mr Colven was reported missing in October 2013, sparking a police appeal. 

He did not return to his home in Portree on the Isle of Skye after visiting a relative in Glasgow. He was a student in Falkirk at the time, police records show.  

Paying tribute to Mr Colven on Facebook last night, friend Alex Macleod said: 'There are no more words to sum up the events of today or to describe the loss and emotions of the people of Skye that has not all ready been said.

'However I consider myself lucky to be a part of a small community that I know will support the family in the days, weeks, & years to come.

'This wonderful community will also share in the loss and help each other to overcome it. RIP Liam Colven.'

Jenny Mackenzie wrote: 'RIP one of the kindest men I knew, a former work colleague and mate you will forever be in my thoughts.'

Mr Colven worked at the Cullin Hills Hotel in Portree on the Isle of Skye before going abroad.

Southeast Asia has an unfortunate reputation as somewhere where dangerous weapons can be fired for fun if you know the right people. 

There are also dozens of legitimate shooting ranges across the country offering tourists a wide array of guns to shoot.

It may be  illegal for a foreigner to own or purchase firearms in Thailand, but you can fire handguns, rifles, shotguns and automatic weapons at these establishments.

In Patong, around an hour from Thalang, the Shooting Café is located in the Jungceylon shopping mall and boasts on its website that it has an 'air-conditioned, full-service café wrapped around the shooting range.

'There’s a closed-circuit TV system inside too, so you can sit at the bar with a drink and watch shooters firing on all cylinders.' 

The Old City, known as Rattanakosin, is the epicentre of gun culture in the capital Bangkok.

According to thailawforum: 'almost 80 gun and weapons shops line Wang Burapha Road. 

'Shotguns and rifles stand upright in retail window displays next to arrays of handguns and ammo.

'For Thais looking to purchase guns, there’s no other place to go, though for foreign gun-enthusiasts, the most you can do is look.'

If you're an expat resident or seasoned traveller in the region the chances are you know at least one person who has 'rented' weapons from enterprising military personnel.
