Jailed for life: Gareth Jones, 28, battered folk guitarist David Lewis to death with a rock and a beer bottle for just £50

A killer who battered a 'quiet and gentle' singer to death for £50 just days after being released from prison has been jailed for life. 

Gareth Jones, 28, befriended folk guitarist David Lewis with the intention of stealing his bank card.

The pair met at the Huggard Centre for the homeless in Cardiff and Jones later accompanied Mr Lewis to an ATM machine where he attempted to make a mental note of his PIN.

He then led his victim to a 'desolate river bank' where he savagely attacked him with a rock and beer bottle inflicting more than 100 injuries.

A court heard how Jones took £50 from Mr Lewis's wallet and then tried to use his bank card but twice got the number wrong.

Jones was arrested after Mr Lewis's body was found in the River Taff in Cardiff on March 19.

The murderer had been released from prison just five days earlier - where he had been serving a six year sentence for stabbing his girlfriend in the head with a fork.

When he left jail, Jones was homeless and quickly drifted back into his lifestyle of drugs and crime.

He was found guilty of murder and sentenced in his absence at Cardiff Crown Court today - and must serve a minimum of 20 years behind bars.

Judge Nicola Davies told him: 'You attacked David Lewis using a rock and broken bottle, you also attempted to strangle him.

'He suffered 80 blunt and sharp injuries to his head and face, another 20 were inflicted to his neck

'You then twice tried to use Mr Lewis's PIN number to obtain £20. Your attempts failed as an incorrect pin number was used.

'It was no doubt your intention to identify the PIN number when you stood next to Mr Lewis as he took money from the cashpoint that evening.

Prosecution counsel Vincent Coughlin said Jones picked out Mr Lewis as easy prey and said it was a 'calculated killing'. 

Mr Coughlin said CCTV showed the defendant walking away afterwards as if 'nothing had happened'.

He returned to a different hostel and boasted of what he had done but his claims were not believed.

Following the killing, the court heard how Jones had thrown away his bloodstained clothing before feigning illness and being taken to hospital.

The killer has been on remand at Liverpool's maximum security psychiatric hospital Ashworth since the incident.

Jones had pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. 

But after more than five hours of deliberations a jury delivered a unanimous guilty verdict, finding the killing was intentional.

Sentencing him, Judge Davies concluded: 'This was a calculated and premeditated murder for gain.' 

After the case Mr Lewis's heartbroken father Glyn, of Ystrad Mynach, South Wales, said: 'We are still shocked to the core - his death has left a huge hole in our lives.

'But we are satisfied with the outcome of the trial and the jury's verdict..'

Detective Chief Inspector Kath Pritchard, of South Wales Police, said Mr Lewis' murder was a 'particularly tragic incident which left people extremely shocked'

He also thanked a witness who went to police to tell them about their son's 'tragic situation' on the day he was killed.

Detective Chief Inspector Kath Pritchard, of South Wales Police, also spoke. She said Mr Lewis' murder was a 'particularly tragic incident which left people extremely shocked'.

She said: 'We are truly grateful for all those who came forward with information.'

She added that she hoped Jones's conviction would 'reassure the public' that those who prey on the vulnerable will be caught.
