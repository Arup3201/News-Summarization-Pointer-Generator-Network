Huge pension pot: Ian Marchant (pictured) will get nearly £400,000 a year from the company when he leaves SSE in the summer

The man in charge of one of Britain's biggest energy firms will receive an annual pension pot of £400,000 despite the company being found guilty of ripping off one million customers.

Ian Marchant will get the payout worth up to £9million after 10 years of working at the helm of SSE which has been hit with a £10.5million fine following an investigation by energy regulator Ofgem.

Marchant, chief executive of the company, was paid just over £1million last year with a £158,000 'cash incentive' on top of his basic salary of £840,000.

There have also been calls for the rest of the company’s management team to be sacked.

On a day of shame for the power industry, SSE was attacked for ‘failing its customers’ through ruthless ‘mis-selling’, either on people’s doorsteps, over the telephone or on the high street.

Hundreds of thousands of new 
customers were attracted to switch from other suppliers at the height of
the racket – which lasted for three years – and many ended up paying 
higher tariffs.

While the fine is the largest-ever 
handed out by Ofgem, it is a tiny fraction of the company’s profits. 
Last year, it made annual pre-tax profits of £1.3billion.

As MPs and consumer groups said the scandal was ‘fraud’ and required a police investigation, it emerged that:

SSE headquarters in Perth has been handed the largest ever penalty imposed on an energy provider

Barry Gardiner, a Labour MP who also 
sits on the energy select committee, said: ‘The activities that SSE have
engaged in appear to be nothing short of fraud. It would be appropriate
for the regulator to refer this matter for further investigation by the
police.’

Michael Fallon, the Energy Minister, said he had ‘rarely seen a
worse case of consumers being misled so badly’.

Ofgem launched a probe in 2010 amid 
claims families, pensioners and other victims were encouraged to switch 
from their energy provider to SSE, lured by the prospect of saving 
money.

But in fact they were switching to a 
deal with the company, formerly known as Scottish & Southern Energy,
which was ‘more expensive’.

Pensioners Frank and Maureen Price, from 
Rotherham, told how they were left with huge debts after being persuaded
to switch to SSE by a door-to-door salesman.

Energy watchdog Ofgem said it found 'failures at every stage of the sales process' across SSE's telephone, in-store and doorstep selling activities

The couple were told they would make 
substantial savings but have ended up paying hundreds of pounds extra 
every year after their tariff more than doubled from £61 a month to 
£158.

Mr Price, 83, described their ordeal 
as ‘distressing’ saying they can no longer afford to go on holiday and 
have had to cut out all luxuries.

In another case, a woman, who was 
paying £1,600 a year for her energy bill, was told her bill would drop 
to £1,423. In fact, it jumped to £1,734.

Sarah Harrison, senior partner at 
Ofgem, said: ‘SSE failed its customers, mis-sold to them and undermined 
trust in the energy supply industry.’

Ofgem said SSE’s doorstep sales team 
was managed by people who ‘received a commission on sales’. It said they
‘therefore had a financial interest in not reporting misbehaviour’.

Yesterday SSE said it has written to 
around 970,000 of its customers who might have been misled into signing 
up as an energy customer.

It has set aside a compensation pot of around 
£5million, and has already paid out around £400,000. The average payout 
is around £65.

Other customers who suspect that they
might also have been duped into switching to SSE were yesterday urged 
to get in touch with the company with their grievance.

SSE, based in Perth, said it was 
‘deeply regretful’ of its actions, which Ofgem said began in 2009 and 
ended in September last year.

Adam Scorer, director of policy at 
Consumer Focus, said: ‘This is not a case of one bad apple. The problems
at SSE…represent a fundamental failure.’

Ofgem said it had decided against 
referring the matter to the police because it had not found evidence SSE
had deliberately intended to mis-sell to its customers.

Luciana Berger, the shadow minister 
for climate change, said: ‘It would be completely unacceptable for the 
energy bosses responsible for this scandal to get any kind of bonus when
SSE announce their financial results later this year.’

Tory MP Peter Lilley added: ‘If I were a shareholder, I would be very surprised if the top management remained in place.’

An M&S Energy spokesman said the 
scandal has affected ‘less than one per cent of M&S Energy 
customers.’ Unlike the majority of its rivals, SSE remains a 
British-owned energy giant and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
