Apple could launch its iPhone trade-in programme alongside its next generation iPhone as early as next month, according to industry sources.

9to5mac and MacRumours have reported that Apple is now beginning its final preparations for the programme which will allow customers to exchange an existing iPhone for a newer model at a discounted price.

Sources claim that Apple has already 
sent materials to its stores to support the initiative, with the first 
line of store trainers receiving instructions about the programme this 
week.

According to TechCrunch, values can range depending on a variety of factors, including device colour, physical damage and liquid damage.

The range is thought to be around $120-200 (£77-129) for 16GB iPhone 4 and 4S models.

TechCrunch claims a 16GB iPhone 5 in good condition could go for around $250 (£161),  less than is being offered by some of the other trade-in sites.

Up until now, Apple has offered a recycling program, but only offers a 
10 per cent discount on iPod trade-ins. There is also a Web-based 
recycling service for used iPhones, iPads 
or Macs.

The new trade-in programme will allow consumers to receive payment for their devices instantly and
 avoid the hassle of shipping their older gadgets, according to information obtained in June by Bloomberg News.

Brightstar is expected to run the programme with Apple, following successful trade-ins with AT&T and T-Mobile US.

Gazelle, a company specialising in electronic device trade-ins, 
resells outdated iPhones in emerging markets like Asia or Latin America.

Gazelle CEO Israel Ganot estimates that 20 per cent of U.S. consumers buying a 
smartphone this year will do so using a trade-in, an increase of nine per cent on 2011.

According to Bloomberg, Apple shares have declined 38 per cent 
since September, weighed down by investor concerns that the company’s 
era of massive growth, fueled by the 2007 debut of the iPhone, is over.

The programme will serve to
 encourage sales of new hardware in mature markets such as the U.S., 
where many prospective customers already own a smartphone.

Reports from advertising industry firm AdAge claims Apple is expected to launch its iTunes Radio streaming-music service in the U.S  in September.It has also claimed that brands such as McDonald's, Pepsi and Nissan will be main advertisers through the service.Apple's iTunes Radio was announced at its WWDC event in June and the release was tipped as being sometime in the 'Fall'.It was initially rumoured to launch at the same time as the company's new iOS 7 software in October.

Used iPhones which have been traded-in at Apple stores in the U.S. will be resold in emerging markets, where Apple’s share is lower and demand for cheap devices is greater so that the resale of Apple’s older models won’t cannibalise iPhone 5 sales in the U.S., an insider told Bloomberg News.

Selling used iPhones in emerging markets may also keep first-time smartphone buyers from committing to the Android system.

Apple was once the main player in the smart phone industry, but has lost market share to competing Android phones over the past year.

'This will help them sell more 
phones, because it will lower the consumer’s out-of-pocket expense,' 
Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics LLC in Dedham told Bloomberg
 News.

Getting more people to buy iPhones, new or used, is also becoming more important as Apple begins introducing services that are delivered via mobile devices

'The key is to get iPhones into as many people’s hands as possible,' Piecyk, told Bloomberg. 'Selling used phones is one way to do that.'

The programme is expected to arrive as the company unveils its next generation of iPhone hardware at a media event on September 10.

Japanese website believes it has confirmation that the successor to iPhone 5 will be called the iPhone 5S, and that Apple’s rumoured low-cost iPhone will be known as the iPhone 5C.

The website Macotakara said that its 'sources in Asia' have confirmed the names, which have long been under speculation.The C in the iPhone 5C is thought to stand for 'colour' which could suggest that the phone will come in a range of colours, rather than the standard black and white options.

Other rumoured updates on the new iPhone 5S include an slow-motion camera and a fingerprint sensor since a string of code in the latest release of its latest iOS7 Software implied a scanner function.
