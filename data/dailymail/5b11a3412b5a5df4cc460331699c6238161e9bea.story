Rio-bocop: Military officers will carry weapons at the World Cup normally used to tackle terrorist threats

A crack squad of 400 specialist ‘Robocop’ style troops are preparing to greet England World Cup fans when they descend on Brazil next month.

The men are part of the elite BOPE unit of military police who operate in Rio de Janeiro and are usually on 24-hour standby to deal with the threats from terrorists - but they will now also deal with football hooligans who step out of line.

Carrying M16 and M4 carbine rifles with laser sights, Taurus PT92 pistols and fragmentation and stun grenades the squad have in the past also dealt with armed drug dealers who are known to operate from the city’s impoverished favelas.

BOPE’s distinctive emblem is of a skull impaled with a knife in front of two golden guns and the unit was first formed in January 1978.

The Batalhao de Operacoes Policias Especias – or Special Police Operation Battalion – also uses a special fleet of vehicles called with one called the ‘Peacemaker’ and another ‘The Big Skull’ as they carry out their role in both the streets and the slums.

During the World Cup some 4,000 regular police office will be on patrol and they will be joined by a further 1,500 military officers during the month long tournament.

Meanwhile, travelling fans are being warned that drunken behaviour will not be tolerated and visitors are also being warned to be alert in case of ‘Express’ kidnappings.

The method sees a victim – sometimes having got into a bogus or rogue taxi - taken to an ATM to withdraw cash on a daily basis.

Victims are held for around 72 hours and are sometimes beaten during the ordeal before finally being freed after four or five days.

Yesterday Lieutenant Colonel Joao 
Soares Busnello, who once was a member of BOPE, warned England fans not 
to drink heavily when visiting the country as he said:

‘If a hooligans drink a lot of 
calpirinhas – our national cocktail – and does something crazy BOPE are 
the ones that will deal with him.

‘BOPE will also be called if someone is taken hostage or there is a terrorist act or a political or religious riot.’

Out in force: Soldiers will provide security during the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro next month

Patrol: 4,000 regular police officers will be joined by a further 1,500 military offices during the tournament

Preparations: A soldier wears a chemical suit during the presentation of troops

Leaflets are set to be distributed to 
the 1.6 million visitors who are travelling to watch the World Cup 
warning them how to react in the event of being mugged while in the 
country.

The flyers advise fans not to ‘react, scream or argue with robbers’ and to hand over their valuables.

Tourists are also advised not to wear 
jewellery, expensive watches or walk alone at night and to check to see 
if they are being followed.

Muggers will be attracted to anyone who they ‘perceive’ to be wealthy.

To date in 2014 there have been 60,000
 street robberies in Brazil along with 360 deaths related to street 
crimes in a country with a population of more than 200 million.
