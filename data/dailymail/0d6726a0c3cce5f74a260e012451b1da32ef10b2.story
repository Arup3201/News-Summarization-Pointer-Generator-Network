Dave Bassett and Wally Downes are to set the record straight about the glory days at Wimbledon after agreeing to write a book about the club’s incredible rise through the Football League.

Bassett claimed that the Crazy Gang had been misrepresented in a 90 minute BT Sport documentary - which won an award at the Sports Journalists’ Association dinner on Monday - screened late last year.

Bassett, who was manager of the Dons between 1981 and 1987 and his former player Downes are working in collaboration on the new book.

The Crazy Gang's crowning glory came when they beat Liverpool to win the FA Cup in 1988

They started work on the project on Wednesday and the book is expected to be released towards the end of the year.

Bassett, who won four promotions with the Dons and took them into the old First Division, is wounded by the portrayal of the Crazy Gang as a team of thugs who would go to any lengths to beat the opposition.

On Monday night, the documentary maker’s acceptance speech included a reference to Bassett’s trenchant views on the content of the film.

In the documentary Vinnie Jones claimed he was the leader of the dressing room and John Fashanu had his own colourful version of events on the club’s rise through the divisions.

Now Bassett and Downes, who also took part in the documentary, will have their extended say in the forthcoming book.
