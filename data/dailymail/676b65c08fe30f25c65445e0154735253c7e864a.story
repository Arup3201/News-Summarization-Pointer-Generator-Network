Say it with...cucumber. Gin firm Hendricks have grown romantically-shaped cucumbers

Bored of flowers and roses?

Then how about a cucumber to show your loved one how much you care?

Spanish vegetable farmers have grown heart-shaped cucumbers just in time for Valentine's Day.

The farmers grow the cucumbers with specially-designed heart-shaped moulds so that when the cucumber is sliced, it produces perfect romantic slices.

While they may be good in salads, they were actually designed as garnishes for drinks.

Banffshire-based Hendrick's Gin came up with the idea as sliced cucumber is a popular garnish to serve in gin-based drinks,particularly in Spain where there are bars devoted to gin where customers choose their preferred gin, tonic and garnish.

The Scottish drinks company approached the Tecnova Technology Centre at the University of Almeria which was looking at ways to promote cucumbers following the 2011 E.coli crisis.

They then asked farmers to grow the veg into the desired shape.

Bars in Valencia, Seville, Barcelona 
and Madrid have been serving drinks with the heart-shaped cucumber, and 
the company says it will extend the cucumbers to Britain if they prove 
popular enough on the continent.

Romantic: The cucumbers are grown in heart-shaped moulds so that they look just right in your gin and tonic

David
Piper, a Hendrick's spokesman, said: 'The giving of a red rose or 
sharing of a glass of bubbly are pleasant enough ways to mark 
Valentine's Day.

'But a gin and tonic complete with a most unusual garnish of heart-shaped cucumber slices is even better.

'Over
the winter months, our cucumber plants have been slowly bearing their 
most marvellous fruit and hopefully their work will start a few 
Valentine's celebrations off in Spain.'
