Mitt Romney gravely offended a second female Mormon worshipper who came to him for advice about a birth, according to a new biography.

The Republican presidential front runner told the unnamed woman that the interests of her child were more important than her own welfare, even though the birth could have serious complications.

It had already been reported her threatened a first woman with excommunication unless she gave her baby up for adoption.

'Cold': Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is so awkward when dealing with the public that he seems almost robotic, a new book claims

The book also alleges that Romney 
told another of his congregation who had progressive views that she was 
'not my kind of Mormon'.

And in a brutal assessment from one 
of his own friends, he was deemed so emotionally cold that he was given 
the nickname 'The Tin Man’, the robot in The Wizard of Oz who does not 
have a heart.

The biography, called ‘The Real 
Romney’, is written by Boston Globe investigative reporters Michael 
Kranish and Scott Helman who spent five years interviewing hundreds of 
his friends and acquaintances.

It portrays Romney as overly cautious
and paranoid he will make mistakes like his politician father George 
once did during his failed bid for the presidency in 1968.

They write: ‘If George Romney shot 
from the hip, his son, before he shoots at all, carefully studies the 
target, lines up the barrel just right, and might even fire a few 
practice rounds.’

Romney’s public image is one of ‘brittleness of his self-certainty’ and even his own allies see he has major problems.

Heartless: Friends call him 'The Tin Man' after the Wizard of Oz character with no heart, according to the book

A memo drafted by his own media team 
during his failed bid for the White House in 2008 lists his one his main
problems as: ‘Perception - phony’.

The list also includes the words ‘Slick - not human (hair?)’ and says there is ‘no story behind cold business’.

The most damning insights come from Romney’s friends and one business partner who dubbed him ‘The Tin Man’.

But even a former aide says he has a 
‘mask’ that he would put on in public and that there is an ‘invisible 
wall between "me" and "you"'.

Part of his distance is to do with 
his faith but part of it is because he just can’t relate to people who 
‘haven’t swum in the same rarefied waters he has’, the book says.

It has already been reported that 
Romney urged one of his Mormon followers in the 1980s to put her unborn 
child up for adoption or face excommunication from their church.

But Kranish and Helman say that in a 
second instance he left another one of his followers feeling deeply hurt
over a similar predicament.

The unnamed woman was facing an 
unplanned sixth pregnancy but she had a dangerous blood clot and the 
baby only had a 50/50 chance of survival, which she hoped would be 
enough for Romney to sanction an abortion.

But when he came to see her in hospital, he told her: 'As your bishop, my concern is with the child'.

She went against his word, had the abortion and did not look back.

Limited success: The book says there is no way to prove the claim by 
Romney, pictured working at Bain & Company, that he created 
thousands of jobs there

But she said: 'What I feel bad about 
is that at a time when I would have appreciated nurturing and support 
from spiritual leaders and friends, I got judgement, criticism, 
prejudicial advice and rejection'.

Romney’s behaviour around his Mormon 
followers was called into question a third time by Judy Dushku, a 
well-known progressive member of the faith.

She wanted to visit the Mormon temple
outside Washington, a sacred rite that commits Mormons to a lifetime of
worship, but first she needed Romney’s permission as her local leader.

During their conversation he 
supposedly suddenly on her turned and said: ‘’Well Judy, I just won’t 
understand why you stay in the church’.

Revelations: The Real Romney, written by two Boston Globe reporters, is published Tuesday

'She asked him whether he wanted her 
to really answer that question. ‘And he said: ‘No, actually I don’t 
understand why you do. But I can tell you one thing. You’re not my kind 
of Mormon".

Romney has long faced accusations he 
is not personable enough to become president but the disclosure that 
even those close to him agree could be particularly damaging.

Yet the book’s attack does not stop 
there and calls into question Romney’s business record, a key part of 
his presidential campaign.

They claim that there is no way to 
prove his claim that he created tens of thousands of jobs whilst working
at private equity company Bain Capital in the 1980s.

The book says: ‘Many companies that Romney held briefly were in private hands and changed owners numerous times.

‘They were saddled with debt, 
restructured, and split up. Some companies under Romney’s control 
prospered, and some failed; some produced new jobs, and others shut down
and left people out of work.’

Kranish and Helman point out that, 
contrary to what Romney has claimed in his current presidential 
campaign, he did not start Bainl ‘with a few friends’ in a small office.

In fact it was a ‘nearly risk free 
opportunity with substantial financial backing - and a lucrative 
fallback plan in case of failure,’ they write.

The myth that he was a small business
owner sounds better on the campaign trail than the reality of a 
multi-million dollar private equity firm, which makes him seem even more
aloof.

In other chapters the authors explore
Romey’s ‘zany’ side, which will be a gift to Newt Gingrich, who is 
second behind him in the polls.

Romney used the same word earlier in 
the campaign to attack Gingrich’s views that mankind should harvest 
minerals from the Moon and get pupils to be school janitors.

The book details how Romney often pretended to be cartoon characters in letters home to his family in an attempt to be humorous.

Once at his home in Belmont, 
Massachusetts, in the 1980s, Mormon counsellor Philip Barlow and another
man were visiting when they casually mentioned Michael Jackson.

Mr Barlow said: ‘He (Romney) just 
said: ‘Oh yeah!’ and he stood up theatrically and started to ooze out a 
pretty credible rendition of ‘Billie Jean’ and moonwalked gracefully 
backwards.’ He could not believe what he had just seen.’

As a teenager at Cranbrook school in 
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, one of the most prestigious boarding schools
in the country, Romney honed his skills as a prankster.

He once staged an ‘elaborate formal 
dinner’ in a busy corridor and another time impersonated a cop, 
something that would have got him into serious trouble if he had been 
caught.

On that occasion dressed up in a 
uniform similar to a policeman, put a siren on top of his car and chased
two of his friends who were driving around with their dates.

His friends were in on the plot but the women had no idea.

When Romney flagged them down he 
discovered some beer in the trunk as they had agreed would happen - but 
then they drove off when he told them to get out of the car.

The women would have been terrified. 
Romney’s former friend Graham McDonald, who was in the car, said: ‘It 
was a terrible thing to do’.

He added that he was surprised that Romney is now seen as ‘stiff and humourless’. He said: ‘He was almost slapstick to a fault’.

Another of the more light-hearted 
instances in Romney’s past was when he dressed up as an anti-Vietnam 
protester whilst at Stanford University to infiltrate what he thought 
was a plot to embarrass the college.

Romney had been entrusted with 
stopping students from stealing the ceremonial axe in the run up to the 
annual Stanford vs Berkley football game - the tradition was for 
somebody to make off with it.

He heard that there was a rally in 
Berkley and became convinced it was a plot ,so ditched his shirt and tie
and borrowed some faded Levis, moccasins and a wool work jacket to 
blend in.

His actions were all the more amusing
as by then Romney was already a member of the Republican party and 
totally out of touch with the counter cultural revolution that was going
on around him.

Elsewhere ‘The Real Romney’ pours 
over in scrupulous Romney’s family history including the story of his 
polygamous great-great grandfathers, Parley Pratt and Miles Romney, who 
had 12 wives each.

One of Miles Romney’s children was Miles Park Romney who took five wives but fled to Mexico to escape prosecution for polygamy.

There are also details that make him 
seem far more human that he otherwise appears, such as the night be 
proposed to his wife-to-be Ann, who was just 16 at the time.

They were at their school prom and he led her away from the crowd and asked if, one day, they could get married.

She gave him a tentative yes but when
it came time to go home, they hit a different kind of hitch because he 
had forgotten to get some gas.

The book says that Romney’s AMC Marlin ran out of fuel before he got his wife home - but somehow he got her back.
