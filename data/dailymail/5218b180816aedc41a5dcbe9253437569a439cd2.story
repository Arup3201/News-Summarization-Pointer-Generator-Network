A woman with an extremely rare disorder that causes her to miscarry has given birth to a healthy baby boy.

Gaynor Offland, 35, suffers from a life threatening condition that causes clots to form in her body.

When doctors discovered pregnancy was the trigger, they advised her not to get pregnant because of the risks to her life and her unborn baby.

Gaynor Offland suffers from a life threatening condition that causes clots to form in her body. It caused her to suffer three miscarriages before she gave birth to baby Oliver earlier this month

Yet she refused to give up on her dream of having a family and now thanks to treatment, she is a finally a mother .

Ms Offland, from Telford, Shropshire, suffered the heartbreak of losing three babies, including twin girls at 24 weeks.

Doctors at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital put her first miscarriage down to pre-eclampsia because the symptoms are almost identical.

But after she lost her daughters in 2006, they decided to run tests.

The results were sent to a specialist in London and Gaynor was diagnosed with an extremely rare condition called Congenital Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Pupura (TTP), which causes clots to form in her body because of a missing enzyme in her blood plasma.

The condition, which affects one in 30 million people, can lead to organ failure and even death.The clots can also block the blood flow to the placenta, cutting off the baby’s oxygen supply.

Ms Offland, a teaching assistant and her partner Alan Griffiths, 55, were stunned when they were told the condition was triggered by pregnancy.

She said: 'It was a total shock - we didn’t know what the condition was or where it came from. No one in my family has ever had a problem.

'Doctors advised me not to get pregnant but I was determined. My life wasn’t going to be complete without a baby.

'Alan has three children from a previous relationship but I told him right from the start I wanted to be a mum.'

In September last year, she discovered she was pregnant but lost the baby at seven weeks before doctors could begin treatment for her condition.

She said: 'After the miscarriages, I started to think maybe I’d been put on earth to look after other people’s children and I wasn’t meant to have one of my own.

'I was also aware that I was getting older and the chances of conceiving were less and less.'

Then in January this year, she discovered she was pregnant again. 

Her consultant advised her to take aspirin (known to thin the blood) and she also had to give herself daily injections in her stomach to prevent clots.

When she reached 12 weeks, medics were able to start plasmapheresis, which involves removing her plasma and replacing it with donor plasma that contains the enzyme.

Ms Offland said: 'I needed an operation to insert a catheter in my chest then I had to go to the hospital and be hooked up to a machine twice a week.

'It was such a when I made it past 24 weeks as that is the point when I usually miscarry. There wasn’t a day that went past when I wasn’t worried though. It was always at the back of my mind.'

Doctors decided to induce her at 37 weeks because it was too risky to keep the baby in the womb any longer. She was also given double the amount of plasma the week before the birth.

Oliver, who has been hailed a miracle by doctors, was born on October 2, weighing a healthy 6lb 15oz.

Ms Offland underwent daily injections and twice-weekly blood transfusions to prevent her developing blood clots that could kill Oliver, who was born earlier this month

'Until I heard him cry, I refused to believe he was okay,' said Ms Offland.

'The care from the hospital has been spot on, I couldn’t have asked for better. They have gone above and beyond.

'A lot of people have helped to bring Oliver into the world. He wouldn’t be here without all those people who donated blood. I can’t thank them enough.

'The birth really brought back memories of the babies I’d lost but we had a happy ending this time instead of a sad one.'

The condition is genetic so Oliver may pass it on to his children in the future but he has been given a clean bill of health so far.

The hospital has now named its two machines after Gaynor and Oliver in their honour.

Oliver, who weighed a6lb 15oz when he was born, has been described by doctors as 'a miracle'

Mr Griffiths, a park ranger, said: 'I knew how much Gaynor wanted a baby - she was willing to put life on the line for it and I couldn’t have said no. I didn’t think I’d be changing nappies again at my age but I couldn’t be happier.'Dr Sreekanth Reddivari, consultant haematologist at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'Only around 100 cases of Congenital Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Pupura aredescribed worldwide.

'Untreated, it has a mortality rate close to 90%. Therefore in the past, Gaynor was advised not to become pregnant again because of the risks to her own life.

“However, with time Gaynor decided that she would brave the risks if there was a chance of having a live baby.

'The hospital is extremely proud to help her achieve her dream - it's nothing short of a miracle.'

Ms Offland added: 'It took a long time to have him and has been a roller coaster, but it was all worth it. It’s still not sunk in yet and I can’t take my eyes off him.'
