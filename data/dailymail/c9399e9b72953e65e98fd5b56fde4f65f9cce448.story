Pilots get the best window seat on the plane and now a time-lapse video has revealed exactly what they see from the cockpit during a flight.

The footage, which was posted on YouTube by pilot Jim Stark, was shot using a camera attached to the back of the cockpit on a flight from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Appleton, Wisconsin.

The five-minute video begins with the two pilots checking the aircraft's controls, before manoeuvring onto the runway to join a queue of other planes waiting to take off.

Once it reaches the head of the queue, the plane speeds down the runway in a matter of seconds and takes off into the clouds as the city of Minneapolis rushes past below.

The pilots are seen chatting as they fly over a carpet of clouds, with one of them even checking his iPhone at one point.

The flight takes around an hour in real time but the plane covers nearly 300 miles in a matter of minutes in the time-lapse video.

The plane soon begins its descent through the clouds as the green fields of Wisconsin come into view, landing safely on the runway in Appleton seconds later.
