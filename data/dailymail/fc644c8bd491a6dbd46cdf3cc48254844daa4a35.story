Cosy nights in eating pizza and pasta and generally pigging-out tend to go hand in hand with being a loved-up couple.

And Jennifer Aniston claims she's just like the rest of us who gain a bit of 'love-chub' when we're happily dating.

The smitten Friends star, 45, she says she's been suffering the typical symptom of being comfortable in a relationship and indulging in carb-heavy treats with her other half.

And it's all thanks to boyfriend Justin's killer Carbonara.

In an interview with People magazine, girl next door Jennifer said: 'Like, hello! Carbonara. It's a killer. The last couple of years since meeting this man have made me gain a couple extra pounds. But it's all worth it.'

Ok, so the weight gain isn't very obvious to us - perhaps because Jennifer hasn't slacked at the gym. She said she sticks to daily Yoga sessions and plenty of cardio workouts.

'It catches up to you, and you take care of it,' Aniston says. 'But it's still fun. It was all in the name of love!'

Rather than allowing pounds to creep on and panic close to summer, Jennifer says she exercises all year round, reported Grazia.

'It's not about bikini season,' she said.

'It's about being healthy. Of course we want to have toned skin and legs and muscles and all that, but it's really just about feeling great.'

It's been nearly two years since Justin Theroux, 42, popped the question to Jennifer.

UsWeekly has claimed the lovebirds - who met in 2011 on the set of Wanderlust - may want to tie the knot without all the fanfare.

'Jen and Justin might be eloping!' the publication reported last week.

The weekly added that the actress is looking to move fast. 'She would love for the big day to be this spring,' added the insider.

Jennifer has been married only once before, to Brad Pitt; this will be Justin's first time getting hitched.

'She already had the big fairytale wedding,' a longtime friend reportedly told UsWeekly.

'Now she's ready for something 'not too stuffy, something casual' with her closest friends.'

A destination wedding is a possibility. 'Jen would fly people out, someplace warm. Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, is a possibility. She loves it there.'

Jennifer has said: 'We already feel married,' but that hasn't kept her from thinking about her wedding day appearance.

In July she told Marie Claire: 'For my wedding, I wouldn't do an updo, but I think a veil is always pretty.'
