It's the most important social event on the A-list calendar with 40.4 million viewers tuning in to watch Tinseltown's biggest names arrive at the Oscars.

The world's most famed designers work overtime to ensure the stars look a million dollars on the red carpet but even with top stylists and dazzling dresses at their disposal, over the years, there's been some real fashion faux pas.

From Cher's belly dancer inspired catastrophe to Celine Dion's intriguing back to front white suit, FEMAIL has rounded up the very worst offenders. Sit back and feast your eyes on these frock horrors...

Cher-ly not! Cher channelled a Gothic Bollywood dancer with a Beefeater style hair 'do at the 1987 Oscars

Doesn't suit you! Celine Dion clearly thought she looked a bit of all white in this bizarre back to front suit at the 71st Ocars in 1999

Colour catastrophe: Faith Hill, pictured, left, in 2002 at the 74th Annual Academy Awards, opted for a rainbow of and pastel colours while Bjork, right, swanned nonchalantly onto the red carpet at the 73rd Oscars in 2001

Thigh's the limit: Mariah Carey arrived at the 82nd Academy Awards in a conservative midnight blue dress - at least she didn't have both her legs and cleavage on show...

What WERE they thinking? Uma Thurman (left) arrives for the 76th awards in 2004 in her curtain voiles, while Meryl Streep (right) rocked up to the 79th awards in a samurai-inspired get-up

Stay classy! Liz Hurley (left) and Pamela Anderson at the Vanity Fair Post-Oscars Party in 2001, both conserving their modesty...

He must be camera shy: Beyonce Knowles attempts to smuggle Jay Z into the awards under her dress train in 2009

Charlie Chaplin called, he wants his outfit back! Diane Keaton arriving at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles for the 76th Academy Awards and, right, Helena Bonham Carter flies the flag for British fashion at the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011

I'm a Barbie girl: Tyra Banks does her best smize to distract from her humongous lilac dress in 2000 at the 72nd Oscars

Underwear is clearly overrated for Gwyneth Paltrow (left) who misplaced her bra at the 74th Annual Academy in 2002,  while Sharon Stone (right) shuns lingerie and goes commando at the 17th annual Sir Elton John AIDS Foundation Oscar Party in 2009

Creepy fashion: Zoe Saldana brought some creepy crawly caterpillar friends along to the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010

Not such a bow-tiful dress: Charlize Theron is all wrapped up as she arrives at the 78th Annual Academy Awards in 2006

Fashion faux pas: Singer Madonna looks a bit fishy as she arrives at the 2011 Vanity Fair Oscar party, and, right, Penelope Cruz shows photographers on the red carpet at the 81st Academy Awards her doily embellished dress 

What would Cartman say? Marc Shalman (right) with South Park creators, Matt Stone (centre) and Trey Parker arrive for the 72nd awards after raiding their mother's wardrobes

The stars of this year's gongs probably won't take inspiration from this lot
