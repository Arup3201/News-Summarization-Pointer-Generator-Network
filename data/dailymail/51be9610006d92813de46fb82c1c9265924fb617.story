A Canadian woman has been denied entry into the United States by a Customs and Border Protection agent because she was hospitalized for depression in 2012. Ellen Richardson, who is paraplegic, went to Pearson airport to fly to New York City, where she was to embark on a Caribbean cruise.The agent who refused Richardson entry cited the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 212, which denies entry to people who have had a physical or mental disorder that may pose a 'threat to the property, safety or welfare' of themselves or others.

Refused: Ellen Richardson was looking forward to a 10-day Caribbean cruise but a U.S. border agent refused to let her fly to the States because of a 2012 hospitalization for depression

Holiday cancelled: Ellen Richardson never made it to New York from Toronto Pearson International Airport in Canada

According to The Star, the agent gave Richardson a document that said 'system checks' has uncovered details of her hospitalization and that she would need special clearance before being allowed entry into the States.

Richardson is now left wondering how the agent had access to her private medical records.

She had organized her cruise with about 12 others and paid $6,000 for the 10-day vacation.

'I was so aghast. I was saying, "I don’t understand this. What is the problem?"' Richardson told the Star.

'I was so looking forward to getting away... I’d even brought a little string of Christmas lights I was going to string up in the cabin.'

Private: Richardson is now wondering how the agent had access to her personal medical records

As a disabled person, Richardson cannot easily re-book her holiday, which takes a lot of planning and organization.

In addition, she does not qualify for a refund for her trip because her insurer, Ingle International, does not cover clients who are denied boarding.

According to the Star, in order to receive clearance to travel to the U.S., Richardson would have to examined by one of only three doctors in her native Toronto whose assessments are accepted by U.S. Homeland Security.

Richardson has long suffered from mental illness. In 2001, she became paralyzed from the waist down after attempting suicide by jumping from a viaduct.

Author: Richardson documented her struggle with depression in a book published in 2009 - but the security agent cited only a 2012 episode of depression as the reason she was denied entry to the U.S.

Richardson has detailed her battle with depression in a book, Hope for the Heavy Heart: For the War-Weary and the Heaven-bent, but it was published before her 2012 hospitalization.

Despite this, she has traveled to the United States on three separate occasions since 2001, and no security agent has made mention of the attempt.

The security agent who refused her entry to the States on Monday also seemed unaware of the suicide attempt, mentioning only Richardson's 2012 hospitalization.

The Star reports that Richardson, who has a master's degree in counseling, is on medication that has helped her depression and sees a psychiatrist regularly.Police were not involved in her 2012 episode of depression and Canadian officials are concerned about the U.S. agent's apparent ability to access medical records.MP Mike Sullivan told the Star that he will be 'demanding to know how this happened.'Richardson has instructed her lawyer, David McGhee, to investigate what she is calling a 'breach of privacy' as well as discrimination.
