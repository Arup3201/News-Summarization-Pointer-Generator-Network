This is the dramatic moment a toddler narrowly escaped being crushed when a manhole cover exploded out of the road in a freak accident.

The square metal cover blasted several feet into the air and landed inches from the child who had just walked over it.

The violent explosion, so powerful it shook nearby buildings, is believed to have been caused by a build-up of gas under the road, at Acocks Green in Birmingham. 

The family was seen walking along Warwick Road in Acocks Green, Birmingham moments before the manhole cover (circled) exploded

Footage of the incident was captured from by a CCTV camera at a furniture store along Warwick Road as the couple and their young child walked past at 12.20pm today.

The child, aged about three, is seen walking over the cover on a stretch of cordoned-off road seconds before the heavy manhole cover explodes into the air.

The couple turn in horror to see the cover clattering to the ground just inches from the terrified youngster.

West Midlands Fire Service are investigating the cause of the explosion which left a one-metre wide crater in the pavement.

A spokesman said: 'We were called to Warwick Road in Acocks Green at 12.21pm today to what's believed to have been a small explosion involving utilities.

'Two manhole covers became dislodged and a one metre deep hole was left in the footpath.

'Fortunately - and amazingly - the family passing weren't hurt.

'Utility companies are investigating who owns the manholes concerned, and the cause.'

Utility companies, including gas and electrical teams, were called to the scene and a cordon has been established around the site while the investigations take place.

According to witnesses, smoke was seen coming from a junction box near the manhole which had become dislodged. No injuries were reported. 

Masood Mushtaq, owner of Divine Collections, a furniture store whose CCTV captured the incident, described an 'almighty explosion which shook the entire shop'.

Smoke appeared to be coming out of the hole in the road following the violent explosion, which happened at about 12.20pm today

The parents were said to be 'hysterical' following the explosion and ran to comfort the youngster who had escaped injury

He said: 'Everybody ran outside and I saw two parents were rubbing the side of their young daughter's head. She could not be aged any more than two or three-years-old.

'She was OK and uninjured but was obviously quite shaken and was crying. The cover had not hit her but the force of being so close to the blast must have hurt her a little.

'I'm sure she would have been left with a bit of ringing in her ears, that's for sure. She was alive though - that was the main thing.

'She was so lucky really, just a few inches and she would have been dead. 

He said the parents, who were in their late 20s, had initially been 'hysterical' after the explosion. 

'Those manhole covers must be around 100kg, there's no way one person could lift them by themselves,' the 36-year-old added.

'But you can see how the blast tossed it in the air like a toy - she would not have stood a chance if she had been walking over it at the time.'
