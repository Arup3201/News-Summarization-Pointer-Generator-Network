Facebook pictures of 17 year old Elizabeth Thomas who was the victim of a fatal stabbing in Oxted in Surrey

A 17-year-old girl who was found stabbed to death has been named by police as Elizabeth Thomas.

Detectives have arrested 16 year-old Steven Miles on suspicion of murder and he has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act following the stabbing on Friday.

Friends have claimed that the Miles and Thomas were in a relationship and that Elizabeth had wanted to end it.

Police were called to Miles' family home above a parade of shops in Oxted, shortly before 5pm on Friday. Elizabeth had just joined the highly rated sixth form - Oxted School - where Miles also studied.

A post-mortem examination carried out yesterday confirmed that the cause of death was due to a stab wound.

Detectives from the Surrey and Sussex major crime team have said the death of Elizabeth, from West Wickham, was an 'isolated incident'.

Detective Chief Inspector Claire Pridgeon, of the Surrey and Sussex major crime team, said: 'This is a tragic loss of a young girl’s life.

'Our thoughts are with Elizabeth’s family and we are providing support to them at this extremely difficult time.

'Oxted is a close-knit community and whilst this is being treated as an isolated incident, neighbourhood officers have been out speaking to local residents to provide reassurance.'

The property where Elizabeth was found stabbed was still the focus of police activity, with Ms Pridgeon saying officers would be there for “the coming days”.

Miles was arrested on suspicion of murder and sectioned under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act.

He has been transferred to a secure hospital while he remains on police bail, a spokesman for Surrey Police said.

His parents, Emma and David, who moved to Oxted from Edenbridge in Kent five years ago, are said to run a gardening business.

Mrs Miles, 43, has suggested on a social networking site that her youngest son had mental health problems, and one friend of the family said Miles had recently been talked out of a suicide attempt.

Elizabeth
 was a student at Oxted School, a mixed comprehensive with more than 
2,000 pupils, one of the largest secondary schools in the country.

Students
 have been told about the tragedy and counselling has been made 
available to them, according to executive head Rhona Barnfield.

In
 a statement, she said: 'We are deeply saddened and upset by the tragic 
news about the death of one of our students and we extend our sincere 
condolences to her family at this very difficult time.

'We
 have informed our students and made counselling and support available 
to any of them who have been especially distressed. As a police 
investigation is ongoing, there is nothing more we can add at this 
time.'

One neighbour said the suspect 
suffered from autism, adding: ‘I often see him.  He never speaks, he 
always just keeps his head down.’

The victim’s body was discovered in a flat above a supermarket in Oxted, Surrey, by police shortly after 5pm on Friday. 

Surrey Police said the 16-year-old has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act

The
 murder has stunned the leafy town, which is popular with commuting 
London workers.

A
 spokesman for Surrey Police said the boy will be transferred to a 
secure hospital while he remains on bail. The move means he will be in 
the institution for up to 28 days while his mental health is examined.

Senior
 Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Claire Pridgeon said: 
'This is a complex investigation which will no doubt continue for some 
time.

'We believe this to be an isolated incident and that there is no risk to the further community.

'I would like to thank the community of Oxted who have assisted with the investigation so far.'

Shocked neighbours described how police suddenly descended on the street shortly after 5.20pm on Friday evening.

One said: 'It's a very unusual occurrence in a place like Oxted. It's shocking and sad a young girl has lost her life.'
