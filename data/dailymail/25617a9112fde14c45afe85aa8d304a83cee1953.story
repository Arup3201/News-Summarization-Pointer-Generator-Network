The Columbia University student who is in critical condition after jumping from an eighth-floor dorm room has been named.

Brandon Marco, 19, was found naked on scaffolding on the third-floor landing of a dormitory in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, on Monday night.

Mr Marco, an undergraduate at Columbia, allegedly made his way into another student's room where he removed his clothes and jumped from the window, police sources say.

Mr Marco leaped from Wien Hall at 411 West 116th Street at around 8.15pm and was rushed to Mount Sinai St Luke's Hospital where he was listed in serious condition.

The FDNY confirmed early Tuesday morning that the patient was awake and breathing on his own.

Police sources told the New York Daily News the student walked into a schoolmate's room on the eighth floor of the 14-story building at around 8.15pm, and was believed to be under the influence of drugs.

The occupant of the room became concerned and called 911 after she reportedly witnessed the 19-year-old take off all his clothes in front of her.

By the time police arrived on the scene, the Columbia student was found lying naked on a scaffold below a third-story window.

Harrowing: A male Columbia student, 19, jumped out of an eighth-story window at Wien Hall in the nude Monday night, landing on a scaffold beneath a third-floor landing 

According to the newspaper, the victim was suffering from severe internal bleeding.

A female student told a reporter on the scene that the young man was very social and had many friends on campus.

Over the past several years, a number of Columbia students committed suicide by jumping from a building on campus.

In 2012, freshman Martha Corey-Ochoa, 18, plunged to her death from the 14th floor of her dormitory John Jay Hall.

There is no word at this time whether the 19-year-old male student was trying to take his life when he leaped from the eighth-floor room.
