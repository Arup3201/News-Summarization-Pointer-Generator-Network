Feminist activist group Femen have claimed that three of their members have been abducted since arriving in Donetsk ahead of a planned protest at Euro 2012.

The Ukranian group say three women, Alexandra Shevchenko, Yana Zhadanova and Anna Bolshakova, have not been seen since arriving in the city, where they had planned to demonstrate before the game between France and Ukraine.

Inna Shevchenko, a spokesman for the movement, reported that after arriving in the city, the activists began to be followed by a group of about 15 men.

Shevchenko went on to say that at 4pm local time, the missing activists lost all contact with the leadership of the association and have unsuccessfully tried to locate them since, according toÂ Goal.com.

The organisation has made high profile protests at the tournament already, and has also previously made claims about their members disappearing.

Days before the tournament a group of topless protestors from Femen snatched the Euro 2012 trophy in one particular demonstration.

A Femen member grabbed hold of the 60cm-high cup while it was being exhibited in a central square in Dnipropetrovsk on May 22, according to a video clip released by Femen.

Femen are not recognised as a political group by the Ukranian authorities, meaning many of their number are often arrested whenever they vent their views in the streets.

Shevchenko has previously insisted that they will continue with their efforts, saying: 'We have reached our goal. And of course we will continue.

'Our mission is to attack any act that is in relation to the Euros. And our actions will be more and more.'
