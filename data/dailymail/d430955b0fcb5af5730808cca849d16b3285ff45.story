A driver has been killed after a high-speed commuter train hit a car on a level crossing in Somerset.

Police, fire crews and ambulance services were called to the crash involving the First Great Western Exeter to London Paddington service at around 6.30am this morning. 

The red car, believed to be a Peugeot 306, was shunted more than a mile down the tracks as a result of the collision.

British Transport Police said the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

It is understood the half-road barriers were down at the time of the incident at the crossing near Athelney on the line between Taunton and Castle Cary which has been categorised as 'non suspicious'.

The car was trapped under the front of the Paddington-bound train and firefighters worked all morning to cut it free.

Aaron Mead, who lives 100 yards from the scene, told the BBC he heard an 'almighty bang'.

'A couple of pictures on the bedside table fell over,' he said.

'Before we knew it we had endless amounts of sirens - police cars, fire engines and ambulances bombing up and down the road.'

The senior fire commander at the scene Paul Cregan said: 'The train struck the vehicle and then carried it along the tracks, eventually stopping over a mile from the crossing.

'Firefighters had to run to the scene carrying firefighting and rescue equipment to deal with the person trapped in the car, deal with the very real risk of a fire occurring as well as dealing with nearly 40 people on the train in terrible weather conditions.

'This incident was a significant challenge causing a number of dangerous and difficult circumstances for our Fire and Rescue crews.'

Network Rail said an investigation has 
been launched but the focus will be on actions of the driver rather than
the working of the crossing.

Witnesses said the barriers at the level crossing were lowered when the car drove on to the track.

A spokesman for Network Rail added: 'There were 45 people on board, comprising 37 passengers and eight train crew.

'The train did not derail and no passengers or crew were injured. 

'The train driver and First Great 
Western staff gave a statement to British Transport Police that 
the barriers were lowered and the car was seen to drive on to the 
crossing.'

James Hector, owner of Willowbank Services less than a mile from the scene, said the barriers close very quickly.

'It's a very fast crossing,' he said. 'Once the barriers go down the train is there within 30 seconds.

'They are half-road barriers so it would be possible to drive around them, but you would have no chance if you did.'

First Great Western said none of the 37 passengers or eight crew were injured in the crash.

After almost six hours waiting on the train, they were taken back to Taunton train station.

Stuart Lambert, a passenger on the train, was on his way to London for a training course when the tragedy happened.

The teacher, 37, from Taunton, said: 
'I was sitting at the back of the train, just dozing, when I felt a 
shudder and the brakes slam on.

'The train came to a controlled stop 
some distance later, where the announcer told us that someone had jumped
the level crossing.

'We were told to move to the front of the train, where they kept us calm and refreshed, and kept everyone well informed.'.

Stuart added: 'A lot of people were 
shaken up, understandably, but the staff were absolutely brilliant and 
kept everyone calm and comfortable.'

A group of schoolchildren from Isca 
College of Media Arts in Exeter were on the train travelling to Radio 1 
for BBC School Report.

One of them, a 15 year old called 
Denis, said: 'We heard a loud bang. We were all told to go into first 
class carriages where we were informed that a train had struck a car.'

A
spokesman for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The 
train has not been derailed and there are no reports of any injuries to 
anyone on board.

'The car is trapped under the front of the train and services are currently stopped in the area.'

'There was one male person in the car who has been pronounced dead at the scene.

'An investigation is underway to establish the full circumstances leading up to the incident.'

A spokesman for British Transport Police said: 'Shortly before 6.30am this morning BTP was called to reports of a car having been struck by a train at Athelney automatic half barrier level crossing.

'The train involved is the 5.46am Exeter to London Paddington service. The train has not been derailed and there are no reports of any injuries to anyone on board.

'The car is trapped under the front of the train and services are currently stopped in the area.'

'There was one person in the car who has been pronounced dead at the scene.

'An investigation is under way to establish the full circumstances leading up to the incident.'
