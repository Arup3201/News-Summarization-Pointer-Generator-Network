Oliver Wilson superb fortitude paid off when the long- suffering Englishman pipped Rory McIlroy to capture his maiden European Tour title at the Dunhill Links Championship.

Wilson had gone from the heady heights of being a Ryder Cup player in the top 50 in the world in 2008 to a lowly 792nd as his career nosedived and he was forced to seek salvation on the Challenge Tour.

So bad was his plight the 34-year-old from Mansfield even feared he might be forced to find another job.

Lowly ranked Englishman Oliver Wilson won the tournament, his first with a prize of over £500,000

But Wilson’s world changed forever on the Old Course at St Andrews when he claimed a one-shot victory over world No1 McIlroy, Scot Richie Ramsay and fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood.

Fleetwood missed a birdie on the last to force a play-off, while Ramsay was two clear of the field after his eighth birdie of the day on the 15th, only to bogey the 16th and 17th in a closing 67.

McIlroy’s chances ended when he putted into the Road Hole bunker on the 17th.

But Wilson, who had held the lead going into the final day, kept calm and a closing 70 earned him a life-changing £489,416.

‘To win at St Andrews is a dream come true,’ said Wilson, who had finished second a record nine times on the Tour. ‘It’s hard to believe after dreaming of this moment so many times.

‘After waking up at three o’clock this morning, I let my mind wander for the next five hours thinking all sorts.

‘Never having won a tournament, my mind kept going back to how I was going to play and I won three times in my sleep.

‘In the middle of last year, playing Challenge Tour, shooting 80s, not even being close to making the cut, was pretty low. That was hard to take and I was starting to think: “What am I going to do?”

‘It’s expensive to play golf and two grand a week goes fast if you’re not making anything.

‘But I just tried to put it out of my mind. I kept working hard and now it has all been worthwhile.

‘I don’t have to go back to qualifying school and I can’t tell you how pleased I am about that!’

Wilson’s wife, Lauren, surprised him when she arrived unannounced to lend her support and, after spotting her as he walked up the 18th, he added: ‘That was very special.’

So, too, were the words of encouragement from McIlroy when the four-time major winner walked up to him on the 10th and wished him good luck.

Wilson said: ‘I’ve always got on well with Rory but now I have even more respect for him.

‘He told me to stick in there, keep playing great and try to win the tournament. This was from a guy who himself was looking to win. So, not only is he a world-class golfer, he’s a world-class person.’

Two mistakes, a double-bogey six at the first and a dropped shot at the penultimate hole, saw McIlroy finish runner-up in the event for a third time since his debut seven years ago.

He said: ‘I cost myself the tournament in the space of about 20 yards at the front of the green at the first and at the Road Hole bunker. They were the only two mistakes I made all day.

‘But I love this golf course. I feel like I play well every time I tee it up and I’m looking forward to coming back next year to defend the Open Championship.

‘I’m ready for a break. I’m not 100 per cent but it’s easy to accept these things when you have two majors in the bag and you have played so well with a couple of trophies on your mantelpiece.

‘I’ve found some sort of calmness on the course or inner peace, whatever you want to call it.’

The only downside for McIlroy was his failure to give dad and playing partner Gerry a 55th birthday to remember by winning the team event.

Aberdonian Ramsay just missed out on a third European Tour title after losing three months of the season to an ankle injury.

‘I’m proud of the way I stuck in,’ he said. ‘I didn’t get it done but I gave it 100 per cent the whole week and played to win.

‘It’s good I can play the way I did in a field that is strong on a course that doesn’t always suit me, more the bombers.

‘I just need to find that extra inch which will pull me over the line in a big tournament and I don’t think it’s far away.’
