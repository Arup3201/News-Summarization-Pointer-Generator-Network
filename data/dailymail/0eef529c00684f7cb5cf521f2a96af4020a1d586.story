New pictures have been released revealing the ordeal of Brazil's Miss BumBum runner-up Andressa Urach who was hospitalised at the weekend after her buttock implants became infected.

Andressa Urach, 27, had to have toxic substances drained from her body after her bottom fillers 'rotted', triggering a life-threatening infection.

The model admitted she brought her health woes on herself after 'my vanity made me push the limits.'

Speaking from her hospital bed in Sao Paulo earlier this week, Miss Urach revealed that she has undergone an emergency operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek.

Without medical intervention, the infection could have been fatal. She is now recovering after having a a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body. 

New pictures have been released of her during and after this unpleasant procedure as she hopes other women will learn from her experience and avoid having surgery in the pursuit of perfection. 

Andressa was first hospitalised last year thanks to cosmetic procedures going wrong 

'I am suffering a lot, but God is with me. It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits,' the mother-of-one admitted earlier this week.

Despite making a living off her voluminous bottom, she said she's now happy to have a less curvaceous rear if it means she can survive.

She said: 'Thanks to God I no longer need my body to work, now I work with honour and can sustain my family like that. I prefer to have legs and be able to walk and lose half a buttock than to die.'

Her voluminous rear used to be her most prized asset but now she said she'd rather it's smaller if it means she'll be healthier

Earlier today, the reality TV posted a picture of herself on Instagram recovering in her hospital bed with her hands making a heart sign as she thanked fans for their support and get well wishes. 

'Small gestures of affection make a difference! In the most difficult moments of our lives, we can see who really are our friends,' she wrote. 

Prior to her brush with death, Miss Urach - who once made hotly-contested claims that she slept with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - had been an advocate of cosmetic surgery. 

She had reportedly undergone at least nine cosmetic procedures in the past five years.

They were said to have included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, breast enlargement, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction.

Most important of all was her prized rear. It won her the runner-up title in the 2012 Miss BumBum contest, which aims to find Brazil's most attractive bottom.

She reportedly had injections of two filers, hydrogel and PMMA, to make it larger and more plump.

But in July she began complaining of discomfort and had 400ml of hydrogel drained from each of her upper thighs.

She told Brazil's R7 website at the time: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me.

'Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. 

Despite the operation, she continued to be in pain and in November she was taken to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg.

She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures, according to reports, before suffering from septic shock and being moved to intensive care.

At one point her life was in danger and it was claimed her leg could have had to be amputated. 

After making a recovery from that incident, she was then rushed back to hospital last weekend with another infection cause by her buttock implants. 

She underwent another emergency operation to remove a combination of Pmma and hydrogel and is now being treated with antibiotics through a catheter and will soon begin physiotherapy. 

Miss Urach hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim the Real Madrid striker strenuously denied.

She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund.

The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.'

He accused Andressa of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel where she claimed they made love for a media interview. 

Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world.

Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years.

These included 226,000 breast enlargements and 64,000 buttock augmentations, a fifth of all those in the world.

Brazil has more than 5,000 plastic surgeons who also performed 78,000 facelifts, 77,000 nose jobs and 219 penis enlargements, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.

But the U.S. was still far ahead for the number of non-surgical procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels, with 2.5million to Brazil's 650,000.

Fellow Miss BumBum contestant Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said last year: 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping.

'Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid.

'We were slaves to beauty.'
