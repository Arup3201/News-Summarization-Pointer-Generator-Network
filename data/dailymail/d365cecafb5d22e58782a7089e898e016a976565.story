West Brom have signed Cristian Gamboa from Rosenborg for Â£1.8m.

The Costa Rica full-back was part of the squad that caused a major upset at the 2014 World Cup by qualifying for the knockout stages ahead of England and Italy before reaching the quarter-finals.

With Billy Jones leaving to join Sunderland and Steven Reid joining Burnley, the Baggies are in need of cover at right-back.

Another arrival: Cristian Gamboa is the latest new face at West Brom following Alan Irvine's appointment

Gamboa had a medical at West Brom on 
Thursday morning and will follow Joleon Lescott, Brown Ideye, Andre 
Wisdom and Sebastien Pocognoli into the club as Alan Irvine reshapes his
 squad.

The Baggies are also interested in his Costa Rica compatriot, midfielder Yeltsin Tejeda of Deportivo Saprissa.

Tejeda, 22, played in all of the central American country's matches during the World Cup in Brazil.

Competition: Gamboa is likely to compete with Andre Wisdom who joined on loan from Liverpool
