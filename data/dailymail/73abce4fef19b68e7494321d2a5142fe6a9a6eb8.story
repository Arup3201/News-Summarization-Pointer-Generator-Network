It is the curse of modern train travel – the passenger with the loud voice and mobile phone who’s oblivious to the sign that says ‘quiet carriage’.

On this occasion, however, it wasn’t just any passenger. It was Jamie Laing, millionaire heir to the McVitie’s biscuit empire and reality TV star.

Perhaps he thought the railway bylaws did not apply to him. But the train guard and the British Transport Police did not share his view and the Made in Chelsea star  was arrested before he’d even finished his journey.

Done in Peterborough: Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing, 25, pictured during a promotional bungee jump this weekend, was arrested on a train from Leeds to London after refusing to turn his phone off

The drama unfolded after Laing boarded
 the ‘quiet coach’ of the 3.05pm Leeds to London service on Sunday and 
proceeded to use his mobile phone, ignoring staff’s repeated requests to
 stop.

So persistent was 
the 25-year-old’s ‘unacceptable behaviour’ that staff alerted British 
Transport Police, who boarded the train when it pulled into Peterborough
 station.

The millionaire 
was arrested after he refused to give his details and was taken to a 
nearby police station for questioning before being allowed to continue 
his journey to London.

When 
he finally arrived at King’s Cross, he accepted a police caution for 
‘failing to give his details after committing a railway bylaw offence of
 unacceptable behaviour’.

No silent mode: The TV star and heir to McVities was interviewed at a police station in Peterborough and later received a caution for 'unacceptable behaviour' upon his arrival in London

Laing
 – along with two full  and four half-siblings – is expected to inherit a
 fortune from the  biscuit giant, which is worth  several billion 
pounds.

Following his 
arrest, Laing, whose own confectionery range is stocked by Harvey 
Nichols, tweeted on Monday: ‘Yesterday was up there with one of the 
worst I’ve had, but you can only appreciate the good when you’ve 
experienced the bad.’  The former student at Radley College, where fees 
are more than £10,000 a term, had travelled to Leeds for a guest 
appearance at Halo night club with Made in Chelsea co-star and diamond 
mining heir Francis Boulle.

Fellow
 passenger Mario Shacailis, who witnessed the arrest, said: ‘I saw Jamie
 being marched across the platform with two officers at his side. He 
looked a bit tired.’

Other train users took to Twitter after witnessing the incident.

Jack Macfarlane posted: ‘Just seen @JamieLaing_UK get arrested at Peterborough station hahaha chin up mate.’

Tom
 Harris tweeted: ‘Fairly sure I just saw @JamieLaing_UK getting arrested
 at Peterborough station, probably the weirdest thing I’ve seen today.’

The
 quiet coaches on East Coast trains are for passengers who want a ‘more 
peaceful journey’. Those who choose that carriage are expected to switch
 their mobile phones to silent, keep noise to a minimum, use headphones 
to listen to music, talk quietly and take calls only in designated 
vestibules.

Jamie Laing posted this image on his Instagram in the early hours of Sunday, featuring former Made in Chelsea star Francis Boulle and DJ Shy FX, captioned 'Couldn't be more in love with this guy, absolute legend'

A statement from
 the British Transport Police said: ‘Officers from BTP arrested a 
25-year-old man from Chelsea, London, for failing to give his details 
after committing a railway bylaw offence of unacceptable behaviour on 
board the 1505hrs Leeds to London King’s Cross service on Sunday, May 
18.

‘The man was taken off the  train by officers and taken to a police station in Peterborough to be interviewed.

‘He
 then supplied officers with his details, was released and received  a 
caution for the offence when  he arrived at London King’s  Cross 
station.’

Passengers can be fined up to £1,000 for the offence.

Laing has not responded  to requests for comment on  the incident.

He
 rose to fame as the playboy star of Channel 4’s reality show Made in 
Chelsea, which is now in its seventh series and attracts audiences of 
around 850,000.

His great-great-grandfather Sir Alexander Grant was credited with inventing the Jaffa Cake, digestive and rich tea biscuits.

Laing also runs his own business, Candy Kittens, where glamorous staff members sell a variety of sweets and clothing.

He has been reported as saying his goal is to become ‘the Willy Wonka or Hugh Hefner of Chelsea’.
