For anyone who dreams of a life changing lottery win, heed the words of recent syndicate winner ‘Wild’ Willie Seeley from Manahawkin, New Jersey.

‘The drama is nonstop,’ warns Willie, who has revealed that he and wife Donna long for their older, simpler lives back.

Back in August, he and 15 co-workers from the Ocean County Vehicle Maintenance Center shared one of three winning tickets for a $450 million Powerball jackpot prize.

'Wild' Willie Seeley from Manahawkin, New Jersey, was one of the 'Ocean's 13' who shared part of a $450 million Powerball jackpot prize last month - he now he says he regrets being so public about the win

The ‘Ocean's 16’ celebrated their win at a press conference where Willie was the star of the show.

Sporting a floppy straw hat covered in fishing lures, a T-shirt promoting the popular A&E reality show Duck Dynasty, camouflage pants, sun glasses and a long beard, Willie gleefully proclaimed that he and his co-workers were ‘very happy, happy, happy.’

‘This is my best outfit,’ he jokingly said of his casual getup. Willie’s natural charm caught the eye of the TV networks and the next morning he and Donna appeared on the TODAY show, where he pledged he was going to spend his days fishing, hunting and generally do whatever he pleased.

He now admits that all that TV exposure was a big mistake as his high profile meant he was quickly inundated with visits not only from long-lost relatives and beggars, but also from what felt like every reality TV producer in the country.

Willie said he had to buy a .357 magnum shotgun ‘for protection’ and pointed it at the last people who came knocking on his door.

The visits have since stopped, but Willie says his phone hasn’t stopped ringing with offers from the likes of National Geographic, A&E and Ryan Seacrest Productions - all keen to follow his every move with their cameras.

‘Would you want a camera following you around all day when you finally have the time to go hunting and fishing and do all the things you wanted to do?’ he told NBC News.

‘They put me in the National Enquirer, next to Faith Hill and Tim McGraw. I mean I ain’t into all that.’

‘There are days I wish we were back to just getting paid every two weeks,’ he said. ‘You have to change your whole way of life, but we didn’t want to change the way we lived. We liked the way we lived.’

Wife Donna has gone as far as to call their lottery win-fall as ‘the curse,’ but the couple wouldn’t be giving the money back and have already spent much of it.

After taxes, Seeley’s share amounted to just under $4 million, which, he said ‘ain’t s*** in today’s economy.’

That didn't stop both him and his wife from leaving their jobs and buying new cars. They’ve also paid off their mortgage and put a new roof on their home which had been battered by Hurricane Sandy last year.

Seeley has also been sure to help other family members. He funded a second round of chemotherapy for his father who is now recovering, he helped one son buy a house and another to start a master’s degree.

Back at the press conference in August Willie also said that he was going to buy ‘a log cabin on multiple acres of land.’

'Just disappear': Willie plans to move to a remote log cabin next month, full-time, so he can spent more time pursuing his passion for hunting and fishing - and also avoid people hounding him

He plans to move to his remote cabin next month, full-time, so he can spent more time pursuing his passion for hunting and fishing - and conveniently avoiding people.

Last week a South Carolina man won $400 million on the Powerball at a Lexington gas station after only going in to buy hot dog buns.

‘Just disappear,’ is Willie's advice. ‘Get lost while you still can.’

Perhaps wisely in view of Willie’s experience, that lucky winner has chosen to remain anonymous.
