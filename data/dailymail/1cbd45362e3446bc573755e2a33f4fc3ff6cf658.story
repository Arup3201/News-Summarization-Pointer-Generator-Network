A Canadian artist had more than a dozen of priceless instruments smashed to pieces by US customs after officials ruled they posed an ‘ecological threat’.

Virtuoso flutist Boujemaa Razgui only discovered that his instruments had been destroyed when his luggage never arrived at his final destination in Boston and he was told customs in New York had confiscated the flutes.

US customs are refusing to apologise to Mr Razgui, claiming they were acting in the interests of American agriculture.

Mr Razgui’s luggage contained 13 rare hand-crafted instruments - 11 nay flutes and two kawalas – as well as dried bamboo to use when building more instruments.

Mr Razgui, a Canadian national living in Boston, was travelling from Madrid to his home town via JFK Airport in New York. Upon arrival, he found that his bags were missing.

When he returned to the airport the following day, staff in Boston said the bags had been searched at JFK and his ‘agricultural products’ destroyed.

'I’ve been doing this for 26 years – travelling with my instruments and material to make instruments – and nothing like this has ever happened,' the Moroccan-born musician told The Globe and Mail.

'They never gave me an opportunity to explain. These instruments are priceless to me. I make them with my own hands and I can’t make a living without them,' he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection have said they will not apologize for destroying the flutes without contacting Mr Razgui, claiming that the bamboo was fresh, not dried, and therefore posed a risk.

‘The fresh bamboo canes were seized and destroyed in accordance with established protocols to prevent the introduction of plant pathogens into the United States,’ an official said.
