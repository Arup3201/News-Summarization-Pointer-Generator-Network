Imagine being able to hear everything that’s going on in your body, as if through a stethoscope.

The quickening of your heartbeat. The blood coursing through your veins. Your brain wobbling in your skull. Even the swivelling of your eyes in their sockets.

Then imagine not being able to turn those sounds off. Ever.

Well that was the daily torture for Julie Redfern whose hearing became so acute it amplified sounds that are normally never heard.

Julie Redfern, 47, suffers from superior canal dehiscence syndrome which means she can hear noises inside her body exceptionally loudly. The condition is caused by thinning of the temporal bone in the skull

She had to give up dining in restaurants with friends because she couldn’t hear a word they said over the sound of her own chewing.

Mrs Redfern, 47, also had to cut out crunchy foods like apples and crisps because of the deafening noise in her head as she ate.

Her job as a receptionist became an ordeal because when the phone rang on her desk the vibrations would make her eyeballs audibly shake.

But after seven years of suffering she may finally be able to cut out the sounds thanks to pioneering surgery to plug up her acute hearing.

Mrs Redfern from Padiham, Lancashire, said she first noticed the condition shortly after her 40th birthday as she sat playing the computer game Tetris and heard a strange squeaking noise as she followed the bricks from side to side, before realising it was her eyes.

She said: ‘I remember it like it was yesterday. I was playing on the game and I thought “What’s that noise?” – then I realised that it was my eyeballs.

Every time the block moved and I followed it with my eyes I could hear them squeaking. It was a horrible sensation, I could literally hear them moving, scratching, it was very weird.’

When her husband, Martin, came home she asked him if he could hear his own eyeballs.

Mrs Redfern can hear her eyeballs move in their sockets, her heart beat, her brain wobble and her body fluids swish around

SCDS was first discovered in 1998 and causes vertigo, hypersensitivity to noises and the sense that stationary objects are moving.

The condition is caused by a hole in the temporal bone.

This bone should cover and protect the inner ear but in SCDS, the inner ear is exposed to more vibrations.

This can develop from a trauma or slowly over time as a result of the pressure placed on the bone by a part of the brain called the temporal lobe.

The average age of diagnosis is 45 and it is believed that one to two per cent of the population have an abnormally thin bone covering the superior canal.

Some people with the condition control their symptoms by avoiding the situations that distress them. However, other people require surgery to treat the problem.

She said: ‘He looked at me very strangely. I thought I was going mad. I started asking people if they could hear theirs but no one could.

‘The doctors just said “It’s your age, when you get to 40 these things happen”. I thought I can’t put up with this forever, I knew something wasn’t right.

'I could hear things that were louder than they should have been, I could hear myself swallowing and my voice echoing.

‘Everything moving in my head sounded as though it was swishing away. I would be stood in the queue at the supermarket and I’d start  to sway, I felt drunk without having a drink.’

Eventually she read about a man who was suffering from the exact same symptoms so she photocopied the article and went to her doctor.

She was referred to Manchester Royal Infirmary where she had a scan and was told she was suffering from superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS).

SCDS is a rare medical condition of the inner ear caused by a thinning or honeycombing of a bone in the ear, which causes over-sensitivity to sound.

Dr Gerald Brookes, a consultant neuro-otologist and skull base surgeon at the The Harley Street ENT Clinic in London, said: ‘Some people may be born with missing bone, or very thin bone, which “dissolves” with increasing age or may be damaged by a blow to the head.

She has a theory that the condition developed as a result of a bike crash she had when she was 24 (pictured). Doctors initially put her symptoms down to her age as she started to notice them shortly after her 40th birthday

‘The condition was only recognised relatively recently in 1998. Patients may complain of various odd and seemingly bizarre symptoms, and may even be considered to be suffering from a possible  psychiatric ailment until the  true diagnosis is made.’

Mrs Redfern said fluid was leaking from the superior canal in her ear and turning the bone into a honeycomb that amplified sounds in her body.

She said: ‘The surgeon opened me up like a book just behind my ear and described the inside of it like honeycomb instead of being like cinder toffee because of the holes.’

Mrs Redfern (pictured on her wedding day in 1994) says that when she first told her husband, Martin, about the sounds she was hearing, he looked at her very strangely and she feared she was going mad

Then, during a complex five-hour operation which carried the risks of deafness, the surgeon had to fill in the holes on the bones to stop the sound travelling through them.

Mrs Redfern said: ‘Even though there were risks I had to have it done, I couldn’t have coped with it for another 40 years, seven was enough.’

After having one ear done she is now aiming to have her second ear operated on which will hopefully lead to a complete cure.

‘I know when I have the other ear done I’ll be cured,’ she said. ‘But you never know I might miss not hearing all these strange little things.’

Mrs Redfern has had an operation to fill in the holes in her temporal bone but she will require another operation to cure the problem. She had the surgery despite the risk of deafness and facial deformity

Her surgeon said that he had only performed the operation four times before as the condition is so rare. Mrs Redfern is pictured in December 2012, days after the surgery
