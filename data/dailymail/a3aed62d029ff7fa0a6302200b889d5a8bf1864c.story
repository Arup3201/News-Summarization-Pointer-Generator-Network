It was a simple question; what are you going to buy your mum this Mother's Day?

Unfortunately, Penguin Books UK decided to pose it to Twitter users alongside the hashtag #yourmum. 

The publishing company had intended to inspire people to tweet in the names of books that their mother would like to receive as a present, and then recommend a few gift ideas, in the hope of getting the hashtag to trend.

But it seems all they have inspired is a slew of childish 'your mum' jokes instead - the go-to insult in school playgrounds across the world - and the hashtag was soon hijacked by amused Twitter users.

Richard James wrote: 'So @PenguinUKBooks is using the hashtag #YourMum every lunchtime to promote Mother's Day. What could possible go wrong with a Your Mum tag?'

Jess Brammar ‏added: 'Whoever came up with @PenguinUKBooks #YourMum hashtag definitely didn't go to my school, where it was the response to most insults'

Rachel Millington tweeted: 'The best thing about @PenguinUKBooks #YourMum campaign? They're doing it EVERY LUNCHTIME this week. Just like, you know, #YourMum'

The original newsletter said: 'It's safe to say that after many decades spent building a formidable and varied library, no one knows books quite like us – and as Mother's Day approaches, we can be sure that no one knows your mum quite like you. 

'Together we make a lean, mean, book-gifting machine. Whether she's a keen cook, a gallery-hopper or a nature-wanderer, together we'll find the perfect read to delight your mum this Mother's day.'

It is not the first time social media campaigns have provoked hilarity online.

Singer Susan Boyle's PR team were left red-faced after tweeting a promotion for her new album with a 'hashtag' featuring a rude double entendre.

To promote the star's new album Standing Ovation, an out-of-hour social media team used her official Twitter account @SusanBoyleHQ to send a tweet ending in a 'hashtag', where key words are joined together and preceded by a hash sign.

The hashtag read #susanalbumparty. 

When McDonald's launched #McDStories, in order to glean 'good news stories' about the  chain, they were inundated instead with tales of food mishaps.

Some have suggested the #yourmum campaign is simply a savvy marketing stunt. But it seems Penguin is still pleading innocence after tweeting: 'Thanks for pointing our #YourMum has an alternative meaning you guys! Now back to the books...'

And Airline Qantas won the PR disaster of the year when it tried to kick start the promotional hashtag #QantasLuxury while thousands of passengers were stranded overseas.
