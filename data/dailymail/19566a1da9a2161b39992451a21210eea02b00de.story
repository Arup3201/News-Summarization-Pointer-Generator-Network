A pilot for a skydiving company in Monroe County, Illinois, made his first parachute jump on Saturday. However, the jump was not for fun, but for survival.

Shawn Kinmartin, 21, has been employed with Fly Free Skydiving, in Festus, Missouri, for four years.Â  He was on his fourth and final run of the day, and was flying at 11,500 feet when the worst occurred.

'The two skydivers jumped out, they were the last two I had in my 
airplane,' Kinmartin told KSDK, 'The last skydiver, on his way out, struck the 
elevator of the aircraft.'

Shawn Kinmartin, 21, made his first skydive on Saturday after the plane he was flying sustained mid-air damage and began to crash into the ground below

Kinmartin fought with the controls of the Cessna 182 for ten minutes, attempting to direct the plane to an airport in Festus. However, as it became clear that he was losing control of the plane, Kinmartin steered the plane back towards empty farm fields.

Fortunately for Kinmartin, he was wearing a parachute, as per company policy. He had never used it before.

'When I jumped out of the airplane, it was at 2,000 feet -- so I only 
had 1,500 feet to the ground,' he said. 'And when I jumped out of the 
airplane, it spiraled and crashed into the field over there. The wing 
carried me and I landed on this soybean field over there.'

According to Kinmartin, he had practiced reacting to emergency situations in the aviation program at Southern Illinois University, where he studies using flight simulations.

After his training with the flight simulators were put to the test, Kinmartin even got to enjoy his first jump.

'After I jumped out of the plane, I knew it was going to land in a field
 and not actually hit a building or hurt anyone else, and my chute 
finally did deploy at that point,' he said. 'I finally had the rush of 
skydiving.'

No injuries were reported in the crash.
