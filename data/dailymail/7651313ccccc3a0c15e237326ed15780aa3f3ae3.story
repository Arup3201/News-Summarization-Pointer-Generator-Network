A traffic warden was slammed today for slapping a £70 ticket on a council buggy while it was parked on a roadside verge.

Council maintenance worker David Bourner left the two-seater machine beside a flower bed in Tenterden High Street in Kent as he cleaned up leaves.

He was stunned when he returned to find a parking fine from Ashford Borough Council on the machine despite it being parked on grass at the side of the road.

Crazy: This council buggy was slapped with a £70 parking ticket even though it was parked on the grass

Tenterden Town Council have now written to Ashford Borough Council to contest the decision.

Town clerk Hester Deackes said: 'It was rather a shock. The buggy wasn't even on the road.

'It was on the grass verge, but had crossed yellow lines to get there, which was deemed to have been the crime.

'David had temporarily left it to work elsewhere in the High Street and when he came back he found the ticket. He was pretty cross.'

Businessman Guy Day, 42, who photographed the ticket on the machine, said: 'What are the traffic wardens thinking about?

'They're giving tickets to each other now. We'd be much better off without them.'

His picture sparked a debate on the Tenterden Forum, with people expressing their disbelief.

One person said: 'You couldn't make it up'.

Another posted: 'I drove past and could not believe what I was seeing. Our local elected borough councillors should without any doubt sort this situation out before Tenterden loses all its trade due to its stupid wardens.'

The buggy, used for maintenance work and gardening, is taxed and insured for road use.

The £70 fine will be reduced to £35 if it is paid within 14 days.

Ashford Borough Council said the buggy broke parking rules because it was driven over yellow lines and left on the verge, but has now agreed to cancel the ticket.

A spokesman said: 'We can confirm a penalty charge notice was issued to the vehicle, as it appeared, following a period of observation, that a contravention had occurred.

'We received a representation on this matter from Tenterden Town Council which wehave considered and the notice has now been cancelled.'
