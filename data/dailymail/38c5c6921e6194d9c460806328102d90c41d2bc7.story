A family's dream vacation to Hawaii turned to tragedy when a mother-of-two died after being overcome by a massive wave while bodysurfing.

Wendi Van Briesen, 42, from Gilbert, Arizona, shattered two vertebrae and suffered head trauma in the accident. She remained in a coma for nearly a week until she passed away on Saturday.

Van Briesen, a flight attendant, had been on Makena Beach in Maui with her husband Aaron and their children, 13-year-old Tanner and 11-year-old McKenna during their first ever trip to Hawaii.

She was in the ocean with her son when she was overcome by an unexpectedly large wave and knocked unconscious, her sister-in-law Lindsey Van Briesen explained on a GoFundMe page.

'I don't know if she hit her head or it was whiplash. Nobody knows what happened under that wave,' she added to 3TV.

Her son, who was not harmed, and daughter witnessed the accident.

Her schoolteacher husband was standing nearby on the shore and quickly noticed she was unconscious so pulled her out and began performing CPR on her.

Medical attention reached her 20 minutes later and she was rushed to a hospital. Doctors learned she'd broken two vertebrae and she was put on life support with no brain activity.

The family was supposed to go to Kaui on Sunday for the rest of the trip but instead they are taking flights home to plan the funeral.

'You go to Hawaii on a family vacation for the first time and you don't expect to leave not whole,' Lindsey Van Briesen said. 'We come with everybody and we're leaving one behind. It's been hard for everybody.'

A GoFundMe page that was created while Wendi Van Briesen was on life support has raised more than $37,000 and is now raising funds to make family expenses easier.

Her husband Aaron took over her Facebook page to update friends and family on their 'horrific situation'.

'I want all of you to know again that through this most difficult week your prayers and well wishes have meant the world to me,' he said. 'Reading your 100’s of thoughts and posts are powerful testimony to Wendi’s enormous impact on so many people’s lives.

I know many of us are struggling to come to terms with this tragedy. Yet... her unyielding faith made her know that things would be taken care of when it was time to leave.'

He added: 'Please understand that our family is going to be OK. We are strengthened by The Lord above and know that it is in his plan.'
