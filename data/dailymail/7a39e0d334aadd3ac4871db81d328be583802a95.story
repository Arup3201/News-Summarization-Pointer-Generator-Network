The Treasury raked in £3.4billion in inheritance tax last year, up £1billion since 2009.

Most of the money came from levies imposed on transfers of wealth when people died. It comes amid a growing political row about the taxes which should be levied on people when they die.

David Cameron is under pressure to deliver on his pre-election promise to increase the level when inheritance tax kicks in.

Under pressure: Prime Minister David Cameron, who yesterday invited Brownies into Number 10 to mark their 100th anniversary (pictured), promised to increase the inheritance threshold before the last election but it was dropped when the coalition was formed

In 2007 the Tories said they would raise the threshold to £1million at the next election.

But the promise was quietly dropped when the coalition with the Lib Dems was formed in 2010.

New figures yesterday showed that in 2013-14 the Treasury clawed back £3.4billion in inheritance tax, up 10 per cent in a year.

Since the financial crash in 2008, the amount has soared by 20 per cent or £563million.

Increase: New figures from HMRC yesterday showed £3.4billion was raised from inheritance tax, the highest figure since before the financial crash

Britain has 
an inheritance tax threshold of £325,000 but an increasing number of 
people are having the value of their assets diminished as the threshold 
hasn’t been kept in line with house price rises.

Earlier
 this year the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that the 
proportion of estates hit by death duties was set to double from almost 
one in 20 to nearly one in ten during the next five years.

A new political row emerged this week over plans to impose additional taxes on estates to pay for social care.

Speaking out: Labour peer Lord Glasman said recently: 'It's good to tax the dead as they don't vote'

Lord Glasman, a former guru of Labour leader Ed Miliband, recently joked that Labour should introduce a ‘death tax’ to pay for long-term care – because the dead can’t vote.

Lord Glasman spoke out in favour of plans mooted by the party which could see everyone charged up to 15 per cent of their estate to pay for rising care bills.

The academic, who was given a peerage by the Labour leader, said: ‘It’s good to tax the dead as they don’t vote’.

At the same conference, the party’s spokesman for civil society, Lisa Nandy, said she thought a compulsory levy on people’s estates was a ‘reasonable idea’.

The Tories have accused Labour of wanting to resurrect a ‘death tax’ to pay for social care.

Health Secretary Andy Burnham has often said he would like to see a compulsory levy to pay for elderly care.

Last month he told another Fabian Society conference that he wanted Labour to ‘embrace’ a system where social care is funded by a tax on estates when people die.

Mr Burnham said Labour was holding ‘internal discussions’ about the tax, which it is understood would be levied on top of the 40 per cent inheritance tax.

He said a tax on estates would act as ‘insurance’ for people who fear punitive care costs when they get older. He said it would only be possible

However, Labour insists it is not party policy to increase levis on people at death.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘People who save all their lives deserve better than a secret tax bombshell if Labour were ever to get in.

‘Our priorities are different: legislation to protect people from sky-high care costs and sensible incentives to encourage people to save for their own needs.’

Homebuyers paid more than £5billion in stamp duty last year, with Londoners and those on the outskirts of the capital footing most of the bill.

Of the £5.1billion which Nationwide estimates homebuyers spent in 2013/14, Londoners paid £2.2billion and those who bought in the ‘Outer Metropolitan’ area £962million.

‘Outer Metropolitan’ includes places such as Windsor, Maidenhead, St Albans, Slough, Reading, north Surrey, south Essex, Hertfordshire and the Chilterns.

Controversial tax: Homebuyers paid more than £5billion in stamp duty last year, with Londoners and those on the outskirts of the capital footing most of the bill

By comparison, the total paid in the North was £69million, £70million in Wales and £148million in both Yorkshire and the Humber.

Figures released separately yesterday by Revenue and Customs also show two-thirds of homebuyers are paying the controversial tax.

The two sets of figures highlight the Government’s failure to increase stamp duty thresholds – the level at which the tax is charged.

Until 1997, stamp duty was charged at just one per cent on all homes sold for £60,000 or more.

Today it is charged at one per cent only on properties between £125,000 and £250,000 and three per cent on those worth up to £500,000. Rates continue to rise to a maximum of seven per cent on homes worth more than £2million.

If the thresholds had been increased at the rate at which house prices are rising, the three per cent band would begin at £645,000, rather than £250,001.

The report also reveals the huge disparity between the number of homes bought in each area compared to the amount they are paying in stamp duty.

Of the 830,000 properties bought in England and Wales in 2013/14, 14 per cent were in the capital, but Londoners paid 42 per cent of all the money paid in stamp duty.

Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said: ‘Variation in house prices has a strong impact on how much stamp duty is paid across different regions of the UK.

‘Some regions contribute a much greater share of the total stamp duty revenues than their share of housing transactions might suggest.’ 

Overall, Nationwide said the average house price is £188,949 after rising 0.1 per cent in July.

Paul Smith of estate agents Haart said: ‘House prices are not falling off a cliff. They are currently having a welcome “pit-stop”.’
