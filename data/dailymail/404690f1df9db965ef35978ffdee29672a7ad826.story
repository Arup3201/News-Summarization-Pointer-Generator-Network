Rapper Kanye West's debut as a designer at New York Fashion Week may have gone over well with his most devoted fans - but a number of the industry's elite have spoken out to slam the collection, labeling the musician's first foray onto the runway as a 'joke' and a 'disaster'.

Shortly after the 37-year-old's collaboration with sportswear brand Adidas Originals was showcased at a star-studded catwalk show in Manhattan on Friday, Fashion Week creator Fern Mallis revealed to the New York Post that she is 'over' the musician, adding that his general agenda is 'not her style'.

'I’m kind of over Kanye,' she said. “I mean, I’m not a fan of his music, and the attitude and the agenda is not my style.'

What a joke! Both Fashion Week creator Fern Mallis and fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone slammed Kanye's catwalk show

And the fashion veteran isn't alone in her opinions.

Renowned fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone, who is known by many for her appearance on Lauren Conrad's LA-based reality series The Hills, also offered up a harsh critique of Kanye's design attempts, while suggesting that the father-of-one should stick to music and avoid any other fashion-focused ventures.

'I’m not into his fashion thing,' she told People magazine. 'I think he’s fine as a rapper. I think he’s a joke as a fashion designer.

'I just think that you should stay focused at what you’re good at. Just because you’re a good rapper doesn’t mean you’re going to be a good fashion designer.' 

Nice try! Kanye's questionable fashion fail has already started to spawn its own collection of entertaining memes, including this one which features designer Ralph Lauren

Kelly was also quick to point out that this is not the first time Kanye's attempts to establish himself as a legitimate designer have failed. 

'I mean, it’s not, he’s not legit. Have you seen the product?' she said. 'Didn’t he have his own line in London, which was a disaster that he spent $10 million to do, that no one wore?' 

And it seems that plenty of would-be fashion critics on Twitter also share Kelly's somewhat blunt opinion of Kanye's bizarre collection, which featured a series of unflattering ensembles, including skin-tight nude body stockings which were paired with flesh-colored crop tops.

'I'm no fashion guru but I feel like Kanye is the 2015 version of "The Emperor's new clothes."' one Twitter user wrote, while another added: 'I can't believe people are actually buying ripped clothing just bc kanye designed them. Bruh give me your clothes & I'll rip them for free.'

Bizarre: The collection included a number of unflattering ensembles, which featured skin-tight body stockings and barely-there crop tops

Fashion friends: Kanye's show was attended by a whole host of his celebrity friends, including his wife Kim Kardashian (L), who wore one of his designs, and Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour

It should have been all about the models on the catwalk but naturally Kanye West ensured his wife (and muse) Kim Kardashian was the best dressed at his Adidas fashion show yesterday.

We're not used to seeing Miss Kimmy K. in anything but form fitting designer duds, but we're really loving this loose look on her. That Yeezy camo oversized jacket is everything! Unfortunately it's not available to buy just yet though.

The reality star has definitely been bringing back this 1990's trend as of late - she was spotted in a pair of Faith Connection camouflage pants just the other day. Take a page from Kim's style files to nab her look with one of the picks from our edit below.

Both Saint Laurent and Rag & Bone make high end versions of the trend or opt for a real deal with a Rothko jacket on sale for only $73.95! Our favorite item here at Fashion Finder HQ is a Levi's mixed media camo bomber, which at $140.00 is also a style steal.

Kanye's questionable fashion fail has also started to spawn its own collection of ironic memes on social media, with one image of him and designer Ralph Lauren, which was taken at the Ralph Lauren show on Thursday morning, proving particularly popular. 

The picture, which shows Ralph showing some fatherly affection towards Kanye, alongside the words 'Nice try kid but leave the fashion to me', has already been shared hundreds of times on Twitter, with fans labeling it as 'brilliant' and 'hysterical'.

Thankfully, it seems that Kanye will always find a fan in his wife, Kim Kardashian, who actually wore one of her husband's skin-tight ensembles to attend his show.

Alongside an image of herself wearing the spandex design, she wrote on her Instagram account: 'So proud of my baby!!!! This moment is here!!! He has worked so hard on this collection!!!'
