When it was revealed that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had asked for not one but two kitchens to be installed at their Kensington Palace apartment, questions were asked about why the couple needed so much extra space.

Now those questions have been answered with the news that a second royal baby is on the way, and expected to arrive in March.

But what will life be like for the new 'spare'? With two nurseries and an enviable wardrobe of hand-me-downs from big brother Prince George to choose from, the new arrival can expect a lavish lifestyle from the moment he or she is born.

THE NAME

With one son already in the royal nursery, bookmakers are convinced that the second royal baby will be a girl and a little sister for Prince George.

According to Coral, Alexandra is the favourite name for a new princess, followed by Elizabeth, Diana, Victoria and Georgia.

Should the baby turn out to be a boy, Ladbrokes say James is the top choice, followed by Arthur, Charles, Thomas and Henry.

Speaking about the news, Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes, which suspended betting on a royal baby announcement back in July, added: 'Money talks, and we were right to suspend betting in July.

'The Royal Baby betting frenzy is back in full swing, and with one correct gamble already in the bag, punters are quickly reinvesting their winnings on the couple having a second son called James.'

THE NURSERY

The new royal baby will take its place in the royal nursery alongside Prince George and will have two to choose from: At Kensington Palace and at the couple's country retreat, Anmer Hall in Norfolk.

Currently decorated with characters from the Beatrix Potter books, the Duchess of Cambridge chose fittings from luxury children's furniture emporium, Dragons of Knightsbridge, where moses baskets start at £75.

Overseeing the nursery and both of its royal occupants will be Norland-trained nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, who accompanied the one-year-old prince on his first royal tour to New Zealand and Australia.

THE RELATIVES

As with Prince George, the Middletons are likely to play a big part in the new arrival's life with Carole and Pippa expected to take a particularly active role.

Indeed, so close is the Duchess of Cambridge to her mother, she and baby George decamped to their Bucklebury home within a day of his birth.

Since then, Carole in particular has been a constant presence in his life, even helping to plan his Peter Rabbit themed first birthday party.

But the new baby's other set of grandparents will also have a prominent role, with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall known to dote on their grandson.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will also spend plenty of time with the new arrival as, of course, will Prince Harry and the baby's Middleton aunt and uncle, Pippa and James.

THE WARDROBE

Although just a year old, Prince George has long made headlines for his wardrobe - and his ability to sell out everything that he wears.

The new royal arrival will be no exception and like his or her big brother, will boast a wardrobe packed with gorgeous designer buys as well as one or two thrifty purchases.

When Prince George made his first appearance outside the Lindo Wing, it was in a white receiving blanket, which will almost certainly be reused for the new arrival.

Costing £44.95 and made by Aden + Anais, a US label run by an Australian, more than 7000 Jungle Jam swaddling wraps were sold in the first nine days of George's life, while traffic to the brand's website shot up by 1,960 per cent.

Other brands to benefit from the George effect - and are likely to do the same courtesy of the new royal baby - include Petit Bateau, Rachel Riley and Les Petit Abeilles.

THE GODPARENTS

Close family friends dominated when it came to choosing the seven godparents for Prince George, although William and Harry's favourite cousin Zara Phillips also made the cut.

The Cambridge's second child is likely to have a similar set of godparents with friends such as Hugh van Cutsem likely to make the cut second time around.

Hugh's wife Rose is also a potential godparent, as are Prince Harry and Mike Tindall, whose company both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoy.

Other possible godparents include Olivia Bleasdale, Prince William's flatmate at St Andrew's University, and David Jardine-Paterson, the banking heir married to Kate's best friend Emilia D'Erlanger.

Also in the running are members of Europe's royal dynasties, among them Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark who is a distant relative of the Duke of Edinburgh, and Spain's new queen, Letizia.

It's the question that will keep us on the edge of our seats until March: what will the Duke of Cambridge's second child look like?

According to software programmer Charanjeet Kondal, the new arrival will have wispy blonde hair, deep brown eyes and a small nose.

The software expert, who repeated the trick two years ago when the imminent arrival of Prince George was announced, has so far proved a dab hand at predicting the looks of royal offspring.

His Morph Thing application merges photos of the parents and produces an image of what the new child will look like between the ages of two and four.
