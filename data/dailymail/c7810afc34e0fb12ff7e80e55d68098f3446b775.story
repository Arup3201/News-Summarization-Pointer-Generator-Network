Liverpool have been dealt a blow in their bid to bring Divock Origi back from Lille after the striker confirmed he will remain in France for the remainder of the season.

Brendan Rodgers had given the green light to pay an increase on the £10million fee they agreed with Lille to accelerate Origi’s release in January.

The Belgium forward, whom Rodgers believes will be a ‘world-class striker’, joined Liverpool in August but was immediately loaned back to Lille to continue his development before heading to Anfield next summer.

But such is Liverpool’s keenness to bring Origi in to the fold they were ready to pay a premium to get him in the new year.

But Origi confirmed on Friday afternoon that he won’t return to the Anfield club until the end of the current campaign.

‘I just wanted to clarify after today's press reports that I will continue to give my all and 100 per cent for Lille over the coming months,’ Origi said via his Twitter account. ‘I am very much looking forward to joining Liverpool from next season.’

Rodgers’ side have been desperately short of goals, with Daniel Sturridge missing 14 games through injury and Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggling. The trio have failed to find the net in 998 minutes of Premier League action.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers wanted to bring Lille back into the Liverpool fold in the new year 

Lille gave no indication that they would be willing to re-jig the original terms of the deal, which meant Origi would stay the full season in France, and hand the striker to Liverpool early - even if the 19-year-old admitted earlier this week that he would be happy to move in January.

‘It is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in January I would go, I would like to join Liverpool then,’ said Origi, who scored for Belgium in their 3-1 win over Iceland on Wednesday.

‘I said I would stay for the whole season and I wish to remain honourable in that, of course. But if there was a decision by the clubs, I would not say I wouldn’t like to go to Liverpool in January. Brendan Rodgers is in contact, he (speaks) regularly, he wants to know how I am feeling.

‘It makes me feel very good and wanted. Also the medical staff, they stay in touch for the same reason – to keep me involved, telling me that they are looking forward to me coming to the club. If there was that chance of joining Liverpool sooner I would take it.'
