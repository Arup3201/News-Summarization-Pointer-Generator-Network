Death toll: Conservative Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said too many people were dying on the roads because of mobile phones

The penalty for drivers who use a mobile phone at the wheel could be doubled to six points.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said yesterday that the high death toll from accidents caused by motorists texting or making calls had prompted him to consider a fresh crackdown.

‘The amount of casualties has been absolutely appalling,’ he said. ‘We’ve got to change this. We’ve got to get that message across.’ 

Foolish use of mobiles destroys lives, he said, with the latest figures showing phones contribute to one road death every fortnight.

The new rules, being considered by his officials, would mean a driver could be banned after two mobile offences over three years.

 A newly-qualified driver could be banned after one offence because their threshold for a ban is six points. The increased penalty would also dramatically affect a driver’s insurance premiums. In addition, the department is looking at raising fines from £100 to £150.

Mr McLoughlin said he was so taken with the idea – floated by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe – that he asked civil servants to work up potential legislation. A change in the law is not likely until after the next election.

It follows research showing texting at the wheel can be more distracting than the effects of drink or drugs. The Transport Research Laboratory found sending a text slows reaction time by 37 per cent. Using cannabis delayed it 21 per cent, and drinking to the legal limit 13 per cent. Speaking on a phone slowed it by 46 per cent.

At a Westminster lunch, Mr McLoughlin said ‘sometimes people do silly things they don’t realise the consequences of’, adding: ‘I’m particularly referring to the use of mobile phones when driving.

‘The person who is using their phone doesn’t realise the damage or the danger that they could be in, so it ends up ruining different people’s lives.’

In 2011, driving while using a mobile was recorded as a contributory factor in 23 fatalities and 74 serious injuries, he said.

Although road deaths are falling, Mr McLoughlin said ‘one death is too many’.

‘Bernard Hogan-Howe has called for six penalty points for the use of a mobile phone. It’s an interesting suggestion. It’s one that I would want to look at.’ Using a mobile at the wheel has been illegal for a decade, with the fine initially £30. In 2007, it was increased to three points and £60, and last year it rose to £100, and a possible £1,000 on conviction in court.

Between May 2012 and August 2013, the number of drivers with points on their licence for using a mobile phone fell by 14 per cent, from 677,500 to 583,700.

Last year, Sir Bernard said: ‘If I was able tomorrow, I would say you get six points for driving while using a phone. The problem at the moment is we are dishing out lots of tickets, somebody gets three points and they have got another three chances.’

Stricter punishments: Met police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe believes people caught using mobile phones at the wheel twice should be banned from the road 

Yesterday, Mr McLoughlin said: ‘I just want to look at it. I also want to alert people to what they are doing – that it is a foolish thing to do.’ 

He said one difficulty is that drivers who have passed in the previous two years lose their licence if they get six points – compared to 12 for other drivers. This means a new driver could be banned for one offence. A Department for Transport source said one way to prevent this was to give three points for a first offence, six for a second.

Ministers recently increased fixed penalties for a range of offences by 66 per cent – from £60 to £100. Offences upgraded include using a handheld mobile phone to speak or text, speeding, running a red light and failing to wear a seatbelt while driving. All bar the last also carry three points.

Motoring groups and MP watchdogs broadly welcomed the points move but said more enforcement is needed. Louise Ellman, head of the Commons transport select committee, said: ‘I think he is right to raise this serious road safety issue.’

Professor Stephen Glaister, of the RAC Foundation, said official figures show the number of infractions may fall as new laws are introduced, only to rise again later on.

He said: ‘The issue is less the size of the penalty and more the level of enforcement . . . The message seems clear: drivers believe they won’t be caught.’

The latest RAC Report on Motoring said 51 per cent of motorists think they will escape prosecution for texting in traffic as they see others ‘getting away with it’. There are not enough police patrols, it said.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Harsher penalties such as six points and bigger fines are only part of the solution. They won’t be effective unless accompanied by more cops in cars to enforce the law.’
