Finding yourself in dangerous situations is something of an occupational hazard for nature and wildlife documentary presenters.

But vet turned television host Steve Leonard had a closer call than many when he took a speed boat ride around glaciers with Arctic expert Jason Roberts.

While filming the BBC documentary Incredible Journeys, the pair got a little bit too close to a glacier as huge chunks of ice crack and fall off the giant frozen mound and crash into the water.

Close call: Steve Leonard and Jason Roberts had a lucky escape when a glacier crashed down just yards from their boat while they were filming a BBC documentary

Crash: The pair's boat rocks violently as sheets of ice crash into the sea causing waves and sending frozen debris flying towards the boat

Just moments earlier the pair had been directly underneath the section of the glacier that collapsed when their boat's engine got clogged up by floating ice particles.

As Steve and Jason sat in the cove trying to get the engine running again, small pieces of ice began dropping into the water creating small waves that made the boat start to rock.

As the smaller sections of ice collapse, Steve watches in awe and exclaims: 'I don't want that in the boat.'

They manage to get the boat going again and move out of the glacier's cove around the face of the ice which stands at around 40 or 50 metres high.

Collapse: A huge section of the ice tumbled off the giant frozen mound and into the ocean

Just as the pair have passed a second sheet of ice tumbles from the glacier into the icy sea.

Steve points out that an enormous block right at the top of the glacier looks almost certain to fall at any time and he and Jason move the boat slightly further away to safety.

He tells Jason: 'That whole front is going to go at some point.'

Suddenly, a giant chunk of ice splits from the glacier's top making a thundering cracking sound and turning the water beneath it choppy.

Treacherous: The pair had sailed dangerously close to the glacier which shows huge cracks

Jason is startled into life and puts the boat to full throttle to get as far away from the falling ice as possible.

As the boat speeds off chunks of flying debris fly towards Steve and Jason narrowly missing them as they gleefully shout.

Thankfully, both men and their boat make it to safety without getting hurt.

And it seems that Steve might think twice before getting up so close to a glacier again.

He tells the camera: 'That was a bit too close for comfort'.

Awestruck: Steve Leonard pictured looking up at the glacier, later described it as a 'death trap'
