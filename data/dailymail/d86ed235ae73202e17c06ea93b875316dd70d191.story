A raging fire inside a residence in western Sydney has left a policeman and a neighbour in hospital for smoke inhalation.

Firefighters were called to the single-level home in Villawood at about 3pm, after reports the property had gone up in flames.

Amid the panic, the home owners suspected a young girl had been trapped inside the house, and a police officer and another man ventured inside, reports Nine News.

The two men were later treated for smoke inhalation, with the officer later admitted into hospital and the neighbour returning home unhurt.

Emergency services arrived to find the property engulfed in flames, with thick smoke billowing through the collapsed roof. 

Panicking family and neighbours gathered on the footpath as the two men searched for the child, with reports officers had to restrain them.

The girl, who was unharmed, was later located inside the next-door neighbour's house. 

The tenants of the house were holding a party when the blaze broke out in the kitchen.

Fairfield Inspector Stuart Cadden told ABC 'one of the police officers has been taken to hospital with smoke inhalation. He did a very brave act and entered the house whilst it was on fire looking for the person who had been reported missing.'

'And a member of the public is equally as brave and has gone to help the police. He's been treated but he's gone home to his house with no ill effects,' he said.

'The house appears to be totally destroyed by the fire. It was very fierce ... a lot of smoke and a lot of heat in the fire.'

Emergency services are still determining the cause of the fire.
