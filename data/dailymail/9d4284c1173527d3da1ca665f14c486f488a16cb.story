A 20-year-old woman waiting to see New Years fireworks at a Florida theme park was struck in the leg by a stray bullet fired from somewhere outside the park, authorities said on Thursday.

Kaitlyn Jacobs, 20, from Seminole, was visiting the theme park when she was struck ten minutes before midnight at the Gwazi Pavilion area. 

No one else was hurt in or around Busch Gardens and the injury wasn't life-threatening.

Police Lt. John Preyer said the woman felt sudden pain in her lower left leg 10 minutes before midnight, apparently the victim of a shot fired in celebration elsewhere. 

'She knew her leg was hurting but she didn't know why,' he added.

The woman was taken to St Joseph’s Hospital where an X-ray revealed a bullet in her leg. She was treated and released.  

Police said it was unclear exactly where the shot was fired from, but it was 'definitely from outside the park'.

Park officials didn't immediately respond to telephone messages seeking comment.

Police believe that the shot was not fired at the theme park but at another location as part of celebrations
