A convicted child molester claimed he abducted a young boy who looked like Etan Patz the same day in 1979 that the 6-year-old went missing, a former federal prosecutor told a jury Monday at the trial of another man accused of murder.

Key defense witness Stuart GraBois recounted how, once ruling out family members as suspects, he located Jose Ramos in prison in the late 1980s after learning the Ramos had ties to a woman who was once used by the family to walk Etan home from school during a bus driver strike. 

The former assistant to then-US Attorney Rudy Giuliani described soothing Ramos with small talk before suddenly asking him, 'How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz?'

Confessions of a child predator: Convicted child molester Jose Ramos, 71 (left), allegedly told a prosecutor in 1988 that on the day of Etan Patz's disappearance, he brought the 6-year-old to his apartment with the intention of having sex with him

'He froze and got tearful, and said, "I want to tell you all about it. I want to get it off my chest,"' GraBois testified.

Ramos claimed that he had encountered Patz in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village May 25, 1979, before luring the boy to his apartment to try to have sex with him, GraBois said.

The suspect, having seen Patz's photo on television and on missing posters, was '90 per cent sure' it was the same boy, he said.

After the boy resisted his sexual advances, Ramos claimed he put him on a subway train so he could go to his aunt's home in Washington Heights. GraBois said he considered that a lie, telling Ramos, 'I don't believe you.'

GraBois launched an investigation that resulted in an unrelated sex abuse conviction against Ramos in Pennsylvania. 

But the prosecutor failed to make a case against him in Etan's disappearance after Ramos refused to ever speak again with authorities about the boy, whose body was never found.

The imprisoned Ramos, now 71, was scratched as a potential defense witness in the trial of Pedro Hernandez after he threatened to invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination if called to the stand.

But with testimony about Ramos' alleged confession and by highlighting his history of molesting children, the defense has sought to portray him as a more plausible suspect than the 54-year-old Hernandez.

Earlier, jurors watched a videotaped interview of Ramos, following his arrest in 1982 after two young boys reported that he tried to lure them into a drainpipe in a Bronx park, where he was living at the time.

In the video, Ramos says his girlfriend used to take care of Patz but that he never met him.

Ramos served 27 years in a Pennsylvania prison for the rape and molestation of three young boys in the 1980s. Shortly after his release in 2012, he was rearrested for breaking sex offender registration laws, and returned to prison.

The Patz family sued Ramos in civil court, where he was found to have been responsible for the boy's death in 2004.

Etan's parents were awarded $2million, which they never attempted to collect.

Etan vanished on May 25, 1979, after leaving his family's SoHo townhouse to walk to the bus. The disappearance helped galvanize the modern-day missing children's movement, with his picture one of the first to appear on a milk carton.

After police received a fresh tip in 2012, Hernandez confessed that he choked Etan in the basement of a New York City convenience store where he worked after luring the boy there with the promise of a soda. 

He said he bagged the body and dumped it a few blocks away.

Defense attorneys are trying to show that the defendant is mentally ill and that his lengthy videotaped confession is a delusion. 

Prosecutors argued that Hernandez's admissions are sound.
