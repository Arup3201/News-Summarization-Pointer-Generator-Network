If politics is showbusiness for ugly people, these are the A-listers who became screen stars in the last 12 months - and not always for the right reasons.

This year might have seen the Leveson report published, police and crime commissioners elected and the eurozone crisis grinding on.

But for most people the year in politics will be best remembered for the omnishambles budget, a certain top Tory caught on a zip-wire and Nadine Dorries' campaign bus rolling into the I'm A Celebrity jungle.

Here we count down the 10 most memorable political videos of 2012, proving that the people running the country are as hapless as the rest of us.

10. David Cameron and Boris Johnson throw some shapes  

With
the world looking on, London 2012 organisers decided to wind up the 
Olympics with a reunion of the Spice Girls singing atop a fleet of black
cabs.

But that was not the 
most excruciating moment. Oh no. The honour goes to the Prime Minister 
and Mayor of London for taking joint gold for Olympic Dad Dancing.

9. Andrew Mitchell's 'long and frustrating day'

We may never find out what Andrew Mitchell really said to police on that fateful September night when he was told he could not ride his bike through the gates of Downing Street.

Forced to quit as Chief Whip over claims he called police 'f****** plebs' he has seized on CCTV footage which appears to contradict the official police log of the incident.

But far more entertaining was his public apology for the cameras in September, including his claim that he had had a 'long and frustrating day' which it later emerged involved lunch at one of Westminster's most expensive curry houses.

8. David Cameron's pasty omnishambles

You know things are bad for the government when spin doctors decide footage of the PM playing badminton is the best distraction.

Sadly David Cameron's prowess with a shuttlecock failed to deflect attention from the Budget omnishambles, which proposed hiking VAT on hot pasties.

With Labour MPs posing awkwardly in bakeries to capitalise on the growing public backlash, the Premier was challenged to say when he last ate one of Cornwall's finest.

His answer in March soon unraveled, when it turned out the shop in Leeds had shut down two years earlier.

7. Ed Miliband asks: 'Is that a lady or a man?'

Allies of the Labour leader say he is the right man for the job because he can identify with the average voter.

But in March Ed Miliband was unable to identify even the gender of a member of the audience at a Q&A session.

Even the beard was not a big enough clue.

6. 'Is this some sort of joke?' Jeremy Paxman mauls Chloe Smith

Newsnight interviews are tricksy affairs for ministers at the best of times.

But when junior Treasury minister Chloe Smith was sent on in June to explain yet another u-turn she knew nothing about, Paxo took no prisoners.

She coughed and spluttered her way through the grilling over the surprise announcement that a 3p rise in fuel duty would not now go ahead, but Westminster insiders agreed she had been like a lamb to the slaughter while the Chancellor dined in Downing Street.

She was shunted to the Cabinet Office in September's reshuffle.

5. Nadine Dorries finds reality TV hard to swallow

Conservative MP Nadine Dorries claimed her decision in October to swap Westminster for the I'm A Celebrity jungle would give her chance to discuss hot topics like lowering the abortion limit in front of an audience of millions.

Instead the Mid Bedfordshire MP was seen eating camel toe in a Bushtucker Trial against Helen Flanagan from Corrie.

The first celeb to be kicked out in a public vote, Ms Dorries was then suspended from the Tory party and has still not been let back in.

4. 60,000 Paralympics fans tell George Osborne what they think of him

The Chancellor always predicted he would become unpopular as the cuts started to bite.

But he probably did not expect the public to voice their disapproval as he gave out medals at the Paralympic Games in August.

Surprisingly, Mr Osborne appears to laugh, almost as if he is enjoying it.

3. Boris Johnson's high wire act goes wrong

The Mayor of London became the undisputed non-sporting star of London 2012 - from trying his hand at sitting volleyball to taking a ride in a cable car with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

But it was the moment a pre-Olympics stunt on a zipwire went wrong for which he will be best remembered, making him an internet hit around the world.

Amazingly, the flag-waving, whiff-whaff-playing Old Etonian was later named Britain's most respected politician.

2. Nick Clegg's apology hits the charts

There was a time when Nick Clegg was more popular in the polls than Churchill. Then effigies of the Lib Dem leader were burnt in the street and dog's mess was pushed through his letter box.

So what does a politician in trouble in the polls do? Record a video message apologising for promising not to increase tuition fees, which is then remixed by satirical website The Poke, before agreeing to its release to raise funds for a children's hospital.

It reached 143 in the charts in September. All together now....

1. Jeremy Hunt's Olympic clanger 

Whose idea was it to start the greatest show on earth with nationwide bell-ringing anyway?

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt kicked off the London Olympics in July with a magnificent display of campanology, only slightly hampered by the sight of his ringer flying off and hitting a woman in the crowd on board HMS Belfast.

It is even better in slow motion.

Forget the Leveson Inquiry and the eurozone crisis, the last 12 months in politics are best remembered for the howlers
