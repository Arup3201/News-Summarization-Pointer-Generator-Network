Found: Jeremy Witfoth's body was mistaken for a hoax when it was found hanging in a vacant home

Two cleaners who found a body hanging in a garage at a vacant home mistakenly dumped it at a landfill - thinking it was a mannequin left behind as a sick prank.

The men, Israel Lopez, 50, and Adam Hines, 36, had been hired to clean out the Spring Hill, Florida home after the owner was forced to evict the tenants a month ago.

When the men arrived at the home on Thursday, it was in a state of disarray and filled with dead rodents 'like an episode of Hoarders', Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis said at a news conference.

The body, later identified as belonging to 33-year-old Jeremy Witfoth, appeared to be in a state of mummification and they assumed it was a hoax, police said.

The owners of the property had also seen the body the day before and they too believed it was a cruel prank played by the former tenants who were angry about being kicked out, the Tampa Tribune reported.

'Both individuals as well as the property
 owners believed the lifelike mannequin was a distasteful Halloween-like
 hoax left by the former renters,' sheriff's officials said in a news 
release.

After the two men cut it down, Lopez hauled it to the local dump, while Hines continued to clean.

Scene: He had been renting the home in Spring Hill, Florida, until he was evicted a month ago. The owners had also seen the body but assumed the tenants had pulled a prank for being kicked out

Disarray: The inside of the home was a mess and the cleaners thought the smell was due to dead rodents

At the landfill, workers saw the body and thought it looked real. Shortly before noon on Thursday, they contacted authorities, who confirmed their suspicions.

Lopez later returned to the landfill with a second load of trash and workers recognized him and alerted authorities. He was questioned along with Hines and the property owner.

Hernando County Sheriff's officials said Witfoth had apparently committed suicide several weeks ago and his body was in a 'state of decomposition similar to mummification'.

On one of the walls, he had left a suicide note, authorities said. He had lived at the home with his girlfriend and several children before they broke up and were evicted.

Authorities believe he had been dead for several weeks.

'Honest mistake': Sheriff Al Nienhuis said at a press conference on Thursday night that the body had been in a state of mummification. The cleaners who found it have not been charged

Nienhuis said the two cleaners do not face any charges because it was an honest mistake. He said the men thought the home smelled but attributed it to the dead rodents found inside.

'I think it's important to realize that… most people, they either have seen someone who has very recently passed… or they see them at a funeral home,' Nienhuis said. 'Obviously, this body was not anything close to either of those. It was somewhat mummified.'

The bizarre scenario is not unheard of. In St. Petersburg earlier this year, a security guard threw out the body of an elderly woman who had jumped to her death, believing it was a mannequin.

He was not charged but he was fired.
