A father and son have created their own DIY Stonehenge with seven foot stones on their family farm.

The stone arrangement, which includes rocks weighing up to two tonnes, was erected by Tom Mason and his son Richard on their estate in Rothbury, Northumberland.

But the history enthusiasts have been bombarded by confused tourists asking which century the arrangement dates back to after they put the stones on display six months ago.

Unique garden display: Tom Mason and his son Richard have built their very own Stonehenge on the grounds of their family farm in Rothbury, Northumberland

Richard said: 'Quite often we’d come back from work and there would be a walker stood there, looking at his Ordenance Survey map, scratching his head.

'We’d stop and have a bit of a chat and they’d ask if this was an ancient place of worship. I’d say my ancestors built it - my father put it up six months ago.

'Both my father and I have a real interest in local history and my headmaster was well-known rock art expert, Stan Beckinsall.

'Every single lesson he would revert back to talking about stone circles, so I blame him for my interest.'

Unusual: Tourists visiting Rothbury, Northumberland, have been left baffled by the display

Richard and Tom have received calls and 
emails from history societies across the country, who have been 
questioned by tourists over the historical nature of the stones.

'To the untrained eye the stones could be mistaken for being a lot older,' said Richard. 'But when you look closely you can tell they’ve been quarried in the last few years.'

As early as 3300 BC, arrangements of standing stones began to be erected around Britain.

The most famous is Stonehenge in Wiltshire. But contrary to popular belief, Stonehenge was not built by the Druids. It is believed that construction of Stonehenge started in 2600 BC and was completed in 2000 BC.

Heavy work: Some of the stones are up to seven feet tall and weigh up to two tonnes

But some more outlandish theorists claim
the stones are UFO landing pads or observatories for a highly evolved 
class of astronomer priests.

All experts agree that stone circles are of pre-Christian date, but beyond that stone circles have proven difficult to date accurately.

Dubbed Rothbury’s very own Stonehenge, Richard says his stone circle has a number of fundamental differences to the famous World Heritage Site.

He said: 'We’ve got no objections to people asking if they can sit on the stones, have a cup of tea, and eat their picnics.

'My friends who own farms nearby and have a sense of humour like myself, quite fancy a stone circle for themselves.'
