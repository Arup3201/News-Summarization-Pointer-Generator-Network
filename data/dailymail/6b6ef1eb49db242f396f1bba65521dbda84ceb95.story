South Koreans have more plastic surgery than any other nation, astonishing new figures reveal.

Those in the Asian country have more treatments per members of the population, with 
one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle.

The figures, from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS), show that in 2011, 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks.

While the popularity of cosmetic surgery in South Korea may come as a surprise to many, the industry there is in fact booming.

South Korea had the most cosmetic procedures when taking population into account in 2010, while the UK came 20th

Last year, 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of Seoul admitted to going under the knife.

One of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper 
eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more 'Western'.

It is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes.

Miss South Korea Yu-Mi Kim admitted having cosmetic surgery saying: 'I never said I was born beautiful'

Singer PSY, whose song 'Gangnam Style' became a global hit, said his record label had urged him to get plastic surgery.

Even Miss Korea 2012, Kim Yu-Mi, admitted
 she went under the knife to achieve her pageant-winning good looks.

The
 student revealed the secret after photos emerged of her looking very 
different at school, but she said she hadn't misled anyone.

'I never said I was born beautiful,' she told Korean media.

While South Korea topped the table in relative terms, when it came to total numbers of tucks, peels, fillers, jabs and lifts in their quest for the perfect body,  America cemented its place at the top of the table in the poll of 20,000 surgeons.

There were also regional variations in the popularity of different procedures.

Brazil,
 known for its beach culture, performed the most male breast reductions,
 bottom implants and 'vaginal rejuvenations' - where tissue in the area 
is 'firmed up for a youthful appearance'. 

Meanwhile, nose jobs are popular in Asia, with China, Japan and South Korea among the top five nations for rhinoplasty.

The country performing the highest number of breast implants is the U.S., followed by Brazil, Mexico, Italy and China.

The U.S. and Brazil also come first and second for the highest number of eye lifts and tummy tucks. 

Meanwhile, as obesity rates rise a growing number of overweight adults are turning to surgery for a quick fix.

Lipoplasty - a procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to liquefy fat beneath the skin's surface before sucking it out  - was the leading invasive procedure worldwide. There were 1,268,287 procedures, which was just a fifth of the total.

It was followed by breast enlargement 
surgery, with 1,295,251 boob jobs. Third was blepharoplasty, otherwise 
known as eyelid surgery, with 703,610 cases and fourth was 
abdomnioplasty, otherwise known as tummy tucks, with 553,399 cases.

Finishing the top five list was rhinoplasty, with 478,023 people having 
nose jobs.More unusual procedures that made the
 top 20 were buttock implants at number 13, with 75,591 pursuing a more 
prominent derriere.

Meanwhile just over 60,000 opted for chin implants 
and a further 47,000 or so went for a thigh lift.

Plastic surgery procedures that took place in the UK in 2011 according to ISAPS

The UK came 16th in the table, the same 
position it held in 2010. There were 95,063 surgical procedures in 2011 
including 19,031 breast enlargements and 16,034 lipoplasty procedures (where fat fat is liquefied and sucked out).

Botox was by far the most popular non 
invasive treatment with 45,464 treatments making up more than a fifth of
 the 211,406 procedures. This was up 26 per cent compared to 2010.

In the U.S, licensed plastic surgeons 
performed more than one million surgical procedures such as breast 
enlargements and more than two million nonsurgical procedures including 
Botox to smooth out wrinkles.

Figures released earlier this week by the British Association  of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) show our lust for cosmetic surgery finally seems to be cooling.

Demand for procedures plateaued last year – the first time there hasn’t been a large increase in more than a decade.

Experts say the PIP breast-implant scandal and  Wild West approach of some High Street providers – the two-for-one offers, hard-selling and rock-bottom prices may be to blame.

But the PIP scandal aside, the most popular cosmetic procedure was still traditional breast augmentation, with numbers dipping by just 1.6 per cent to 9,854.

BAAPS president Rajiv Grover said: ‘The desire for larger breasts is centuries-old. Scandals come and go – in this case, the cause was an isolated case of criminal manufacturing practices. This has made women anxious but breast augmentation remains a very safe operation.'
