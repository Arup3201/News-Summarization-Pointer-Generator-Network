Crashing down steps, staggering over the road and falling over on an escalator, these are the shameful binge drinkers of Britain.

A video, which also features a woman failing to pick up her lost shoe on the pavement, has been released to highlight the embarrassing actions of drunks who have consumed too much alcohol.

Drinks maker Diageo, which owns the Smirnoff vodka and Guinness brands, wants the one-minute clip to encourage people to drink more responsibly for its Think How You Drink campaign.

Failed attempts: This woman staggered around in a circle and was unable to pick up her lost shoe on the floor

What a total embarrassment: These two women were hardly able to stay upright or walk in a straight line

Face down: This man couldn't even stay upright on an escalator, in the video from drinks maker Diageo

The video was revealed as a survey carried out by the company revealed that 40 per cent of women have been embarrassed by drunken images of themselves posted on social networking websites.

The drinkers admitted waking up to find friends had uploading videos and pictures of their drunken behaviour.

And 16 per cent recalled asking friends to take down the offending material - for fear their families or employers might see.

The phenomenon - dubbed a 'digital hangover' - has increased thanks to the popularity of Facebook, Twitter and the spread of camera phones.

Odd sight: This man was apparently unable to cross the road, walking around and staggering backwards

Painful: This man was filmed managing to fall down two sets of steps, despite holding onto the handrail on each

Making a fool: The video was revealed as a survey carried out by the company revealed that 40 per cent of women have been embarrassed by drunken images of themselves posted on social networking websites

Almost half of all women respondents - 47 per cent - said they would judge female friends based on embarrassing material posted online.

'Campaigns in the past have tended to preach or to scare. We are deliberately using humour to catch people’s attention'

The survey also revealed more than 50 per cent of men had got so drunk they could not remember their journey home after a night out, compared with 31 per cent of females.

Men were also more likely to apologise to their other halves after a drunken argument, with 36 per cent saying sorry against just 28 per cent of women.

Diageo spokesman Malcolm D’Sa told The Sun of the video: ‘Campaigns in the past have tended to preach or to scare. We are deliberately using humour to catch people’s attention.’
