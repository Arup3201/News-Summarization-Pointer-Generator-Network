A fox and a hedgehog have become the most unlikely of friends after they were caught enjoying a fine dining experience together.

The animals were captured eating food on webcams set up by wildlife enthusiast Jason Alexander, at his home in Rushmere St Andrew, Suffolk.

Mr Alexander said he expected the fox to see the hedgehog as prey but was surprised to see them feed side by side.

Do you come here often? A wildlife enthusiast was stunned when he put up a secret camera in his garden - and caught a hedgehog sharing a meal with a fox

He said. 'I think there have been several of each using the feeding stations. They seem to tolerate each other.'

Mr Alexander, 43, says he has 30 webcams set up in his garden 's feeding stations, which he uses to monitor nest boxes and his nightly visitors.

He says the hedgehogs feed about 10 times a night and are joined by the fox between 1am and 3am in the morning - most likely after a night on the tiles.Â 

He also has another hedgehog, whose
 behaviour has changed recently as it builds a nest - signalling that it might be a pregnant female.

Yummy: The fox seems focused on devouring its meal - thankfully it is not the hedgehog

Fine dining: Have you heard the one about the fox and the hedgehog who dine out early in the morning?

Wildlife experts suggest that foxes do not generally pose a threat to hedgehogs but there are rare incidents where foxes can prey on the spiky hedgehog.

Some foxes will wait for a hedgehog to unroll from its defensive ball, before taking a bite at it.

But this chummy pair appear to be more interested in feasting at the Hog Buffet Bar giving Mr Alexander delightful footage.

The wildlife enthusiast reveals that he starts his day by sitting with a cuppa and taking a long look back at the footage from the night before.

Finished: The fox appears to take a crafty look in front of it - is it looking for dessert?
