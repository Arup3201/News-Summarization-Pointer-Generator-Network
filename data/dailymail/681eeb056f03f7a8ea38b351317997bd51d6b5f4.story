These unsuspecting filmgoers thought they were in for a relaxing night at the cinema.

Little did they know they would be given the shock of their lives when they were led into a creepy room and found a terrifying figure leaping out at them from a mirror.

But fortunately, it was all a stunt part of a promotion for the new Karen Gillan film, Oculus and was filmed at an advanced screening of the movie.

The unsuspecting filmgoers were led into the creepy room in pairs with only a torch

But when they approached the mirror, which is central to the film, a demon woman slams herself against it

The shock of seeing the woman staring back at them in the mirror causes these two girls to run away in fright

Organisers say the prank, which terrified these competition winners was carried out using old fashioned theatre trickery

Around 350 competition winners and journalists attended the screening at the Haymarket Cineworld in central London.

But before the film they were sent into a dark room in pairs with just a torch for company and in the room is the haunted mirror, which features heavily in the film.

When the guests get close to the two way mirror, it begins to light up and then a 'demon' woman slams against the glass, giving the filmgoers are huge fright.

But not content with giving their guests one scare, a statute to the right of the room starts to move towards them, scaring them once more.

An actress playing the demon woman was stationed behind a two-way mirror ready to scare the filmgoers

One of the statues in the right of the room also had an actress inside, ready to give the guests another fright on their way out

The film, which is released on Friday, June 13, stars the former Doctor Who assistant as a young woman who is convinced that an antique mirror is responsible for the death and misfortune her family has suffered.

Organisers of the prank say they employed classic theatre trickery techniques to recreate the scene where mirror comes to life.

An actress playing the demon woman was stationed behind a two-way mirror, while one of the statues also had an actress inside it.

Once the two-way mirror was exposed the demon gave the filmgoers their first scare, before the statute then came to life, scaring them once again.
