Women with significant others can often feel they slip into the role of PA when it comes to organising their man's life.

And they'd be right. Men still rely on their partners to remind them what they’ve got planned, despite owning the latest gadgets, a new study reveals.

New research released today shows one
in five men (21 per cent) bank on their partners remembering what they 
have planned on the weekend.

Women with significant others can often feel they slip into the role of PA when it comes to organizing their man's life.

Three quarters of us (72 per cent) now own a smartphone which is equipped with easy-to-use apps and calendars.

But it appears men still trust their better halves to keep their social calenders up to date - including parties, birthdays and nights out.

And it appears it is not just remembering what we have planned that proves to be difficult.

One in three (32 per cent) struggle to organise their social lives, while 22 per cent will even get friends and family to plan it for them.

The new research quizzed 2,000 Brits on how they organise their free time.

It reveals more than a third of us (38 per cent) rely on memory.

This results in one in five men (19 per cent) forgetting about anniversaries and birthdays.

People in Bristol rely on their partners the most (27 per cent) followed by Plymouth (23 per cent) and Glasgow (20 per cent).

Roy Blanga, managing director at Groupon UK who conducted the study, said: 'It can be difficult to get events booked in when you’re dealing with friends and family.

'But there are so many easy-to-use mobile apps and websites out there to help us find inspiration, there’s no reason not to the rescue the situation and organise a get-together in the spur of the moment.

'We can quickly search online for deals on theatre trips, comedy gigs, or even holidays - all the information is available at our fingertips.'
