Lord de Mauley said families 'make do and mend' by repairing broken appliances to reduce waste sent to landfill

Families should recapture the spirit of ‘make do and mend’ by repairing broken washing machines, toasters and televisions rather than buying new ones, a Tory minister claimed last night.

Lord de Mauley, an environment minister, said even when shopping for new appliances, gadgets and even clothes, people should consider buying second hand goods online on auction websites such as eBay -  to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill.

The proposal to make it easier for people to fix or replace households items with good quality used ones is part of a ‘waste prevention programme’ published by the environment department to comply with an EU directive.

Ministers say changing our throwaway culture will not only cut down on the tonnes of household waste thrown away every year and help the environment, but will also save families money.

‘Reducing waste is everyone’s responsibility’, Lord de Mauley told the Daily Telegraph, ‘What we have set out in this programme will help businesses save money, help people cut back on waste and pass on items that they would otherwise throw away’.

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will first measure the nation’s progress by calculating how many tonnes of waste are produced by households, businesses and industry and setting reduction targets.

Businesses and families will be told to take care not to waste food, paper, plastics, and electronic and electrical equipment, according to proposals published in a consultation which will be considered until the end of next month.

But Tory MP Douglas Carswell, said: ‘Since when do we need government to tell us what to do with broken toasters? I don’t really want to live in a world where Defra officials can decide what I do with electrical appliances that I could repair.’

Despite this drive to reduce waste, Defra have resisted calls for a charge on single use carrier bags in England, although such a charge has been successful in Wales and Northern Ireland and will begin shortly in Scotland. Banning plastic carrier bags, backed by a Daily Mail campaign, has widespread political support.

The consultation document states that consumers should ‘consider their own buying habits to identify where they could make savings’, for example, through wasting less food.

It states: ‘There are several simple practices which all contribute to reducing the amount of waste produced; from reusing shopping bags, repairing items instead of automatically replacing them, passing on items no longer needed or selling them, e.g. through online auction sites’.

Making and selling electronic and electrical equipment will face demands from government agencies to make products which last for longer and are easier to repair.

Officials say helping people to recycle as much as possible would save British businesses £17 billion a year, while re-using household appliances and furniture could save families £1 billion a year as well as create work for repair shops.

As electrical goods have become cheaper, there are fewer electrical repair shops, and the consultation says shopkeepers have a ‘key role’ in convincing people they can have a lifetime of use out of a product.

Under European laws, Britain must produce a waste strategy by the end of the year.

The EU directive on waste recommends measures including forcing consumers to pay for items of packaging which would otherwise be free to reduce the amount of excess paper and plastic used.

Earlier this year, another Defra minister, Richard Benyon warned that families were needlessly wasting ‘enormous amounts of food’ worth  up to £50 of food a month, much of which was ‘perfectly safe’ to eat.

According to government figures, about 228 million tonnes of waste is thrown away every year in England.
