'Murderous rage': Julia Gillard has left politics since losing her incumbency in June

Former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard made an extraordinary attack last night on the 'violent, ugly sexism' she said she experienced during her three years in charge of the nation.

It reached the point when the British-born politician felt 'murderous rage' at seeing the sexist cartoons and comments that had been made online about her, she said.

'For my personal liberty, it's probably a good thing that I didn't focus on them,' she remarked in her first public appearance since she lost the Prime Minister's job to Kevin Rudd in June.

Speaking at a public forum at the iconic Sydney Opera House, Miss Gillard - who has now resigned from politics - said she was surprised at the depth of abuse that had been levelled at her as the country's first female Prime Minister.

'I find it depressing and a surprise that really violent, ugly sexism still exists in Australia,' she told the enthusiastically supportive audience.

'It just amazes me that we can be having this infantile conversation about gender wars and you just feel like saying "Well, if it was your daughter and she was putting up with sexist abuse at work, what would you advise her to do?'

She added: 'Because, apparently, if she complains, she is playing the victim and playing gender wars - and if she doesn't complain, then she really is a victim.'

Women and girls, said Miss Gillard, had a right to an environment 'that treats you with respect, treats you as an equal and raising your voice about that isn't starting a war, it isn't playing the victim, it's just asking for what simply is right.'

During the interview with feminist author Anne Summers, Miss Gillard said she had believed that Australia was beyond the kind of thinking that woman were not being treated with respect - 'and it's kind of depressing that we (the country) are not.

'Women deserve respect': Women and girls, said Miss Gillard, had a right to an environment 'that treats you with respect, treats you as an equal and raising your voice about that isn't starting a war, it isn't playing the victim, it's just asking for what simply is right'

'But at least we know exactly where the balance of it is now and what more remains to be done for women to be truly equal.'

The 52-year-old former lawyer who became Labour's leader, was Prime Minister from June 2010 to June this year, when Kevin Rudd challenged her for the top job - and won.

She said that recent reporting that she and long-term partner Tim Mathieson - known as 'Australia's First Bloke' when she was in office - had split revealed another case point in the 'foibles' of the media.

'First Bloke': She said that recent reporting that she and long-term partner Tim Mathieson (right) - known as 'Australia's First Bloke' when she was in office - had split revealed another case point in the 'foibles' of the media.

Referring to Mr Rudd, she said the difference between them was that she had always worked for the Labour Party.

'So I quickly concluded after the meeting (of Labour colleagues which voted Mr Rudd back into the top job for the second time) that the best thing I could do is accept that that was the judgement that had been made and to give a gift of silence to the Labour Party during the course of the (general election) campaign, to do absolutely nothing.'

Miss Gillard is now working on a book and is due to soon take up an honorary professorship at Adelaide University.
