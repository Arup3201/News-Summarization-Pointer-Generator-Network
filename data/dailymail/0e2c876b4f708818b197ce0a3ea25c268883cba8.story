TV star Kirstie Allsopp admits that she felt a little foolish dressing up as Hollywood star Audrey Hepburn in a photoshoot for Comic Relief.

The Location Location, Location presenter donned a black dress and gloves, pearls and a tiara to pose as the late screen beauty.

Allsopp, 41, said that she was 'both flattered and terrified in equal measure' when she was asked to recreate Hepburn's famous Breakfast At Tiffany's image to promote new food fundraiser Menu Relief.

She said of the photoshoot: 'Someone puts your hair up and you put the pearls on and you find the black dress and put on the gloves and you feel a twit but that's fine.

Breakfast at Kirstie's: Miss Allsopp posed as Hepburn's iconic Holly Golightly character to promote Comic Relief's Menu Relief scheme where diners at certain restaurants can donate to the charity

'If someone ends up going to a restaurant and dining out and donating as a result of the fact that I mucked about pretending to be Audrey Hepburn then that's brilliant. It's a no-brainer.'

Allsopp said of Menu Relief: 'People are always looking for ways to get on with their day-to-day life and donate. We've got Valentine's day coming up. It's a big night when people do think about eating out.'

Daunting: Kirstie, 41, said the idea of dressing up as Hepburn's famous character from the 1961 film, RIGHT, was 'flattering but terrifying'

The star tweeted about the photoshoot: 'Off to shoot for Red Nose Day. They are dressing me up as Audrey Hepburn - Now that is what I call funny 'bumthesizeofmyboob'.

Over 300 restaurants are taking part in Menu Relief by creating special Red Nose Day menus with money going to the charity.

Fellow TV presenter Claudia Winkleman also endorsed the fundraiser, saying: 'For people like me who aren't great at cooking, eating out at a Menu Relief restaurant is the perfect solution.

'My husband gets a great meal out without any burnt bits and I get to enjoy my evening!'

Game: 'If someone ends up going to a restaurant and dining out and donating as a result of the fact that I mucked about pretending to be Audrey Hepburn then that's brilliant. It's a no-brainer'

And here's one we've seen earlier: Glamour girl Jodie Marsh tweeted this old photograph of herself dressed as Audrey Hepburn recently saying: 'This is my mum's favourite picture of me,'

Menu Relief runs from now until Red Nose Day on Friday 15 March. Menu Relief restaurants can be found at www.rednoseday.com/menurelief
