From Winnie to Paddington to Rupert, fictional bears are often friendly beasts.

However, their real life counterparts tend to have grizzlier reputations, which is why photographer Andrey Slepnev, 31, could barely believe his eyes when one of the creatures starting waving at him.

Mr Slepnev took these hilarious snaps at Madrid Zoo while on a trip to Spain from his home in Moscow, Russia.

The bear entertained visitors to Madrid Zoo by sitting at the edge of his enclosure and waving excitedly at them

The friendly animal wandered to the front of his enclosure before sitting back in full view of zoo guests and lifting his powerful paw in a decidedly wave-like motion.

Mr Slepnev said: 'The bear seemed extremely happy - the more people waved back at him the longer he waved for.

Witnesses said the more people waved back at the bear, the more effort it seemed to put into its own actions

After several minutes of waving on his own, other bears started following the example set by the friendly beast

'He was waving for about three minutes and then the other bears started copying him too.

'I'd only ever seen this kind of behaviour before in a circus so perhaps that's what he used to do.

'Apparently they wave to zookeepers when they want feeding so they try to get food from guests too - it looks like a restaurant.

'I was glad I had my camera with me to capture this funny moment.'

The bears are known to wave at zookeepers when they are hungry and this bear was likely looking for a snack

Mr Slepnev had only seen bears act this way in the circus and wondered if this animal was an ex-performer

Mr Slepnev said the bear seemed extremely happy and was enjoying the attention from passers-by
