Tragic: Nick Mutton drowned while trying to rescue his dog in Newton Abbott, Devon

Primary school teacher Nick Mutton was killed after being swept away on Christmas Eve, becoming the sixth victim of the stormy weather that has hit the UK over the festive period.

The 46-year-old, who taught Year 2 pupils, was with his family at an Asda in Newton Abbot, Devon, getting last-minute supplies for Christmas, when his dog ventured into the river near to the store.

Three police officers and several firefighters managed to drag him from the river from a footbridge and perform CPR.

He was taken by air ambulance to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital,where he fought for his life for hours.

But died later that afternoon with his family by his side.

Friends paid tribute to Mr Mutton on Facebook.

One said: 'My thoughts go out to all family and friends of Nick Mutton, whose been my friend since the 'Ship Quiz Days', taught my daughter at Cockington School and has been an inspiration for many other children.

'You will be missed, but you have left an indelible mark on many.

Another said: 'R.I.S.P To Mr Nick Mutton, a great teacher and all round man. A very tragic loss. Especially at this time of year. My heart goes out to the mutton family with huge wishes and condolences.'

His dog managed to escape from the water with assistance from a member of the public.

A dog walker saw police running and shouting that someone was on the bridge and saw officers retrieve Mr Mutton from the river.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall 
Police said: 'It's going to be a coroner's investigation supported by 
the police into what we perceive to be a tragic accident.'

Martin Bignel, a local resident, tweeted 
that the river, which runs at the end of his road, had been 'about
 7ft higher than usual' on Monday evening as a result of the persistent 
rainfall.

A spokesman for 
Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said: 'On arrival at the 
scene crews requested the attendance of the coastguard helicopter to 
assist with the rescue of the person and confirmed one dog had been 
rescued by members which has mattered  across Britain over the past two 
days.
