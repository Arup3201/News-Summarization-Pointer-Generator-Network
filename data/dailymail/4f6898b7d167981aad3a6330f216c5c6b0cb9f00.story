Tim Tebow, whose stint as a National Football League quarterback briefly sparked 'Tebow-mania', spent Monday trying to make a comeback in a workout for the Philadelphia Eagles.

But after one day of training, Tebow left without being signed, according to ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter.

The 27-year-old  who once played for the Denver Broncos and New York Jets performed for the Eagles and coach Chip Kelly in hopes of trying out for a quarterback position, a source told AP.

Considering all the offseason moves made by  Kelly, taking a look at the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner with the huge following shouldn't be a surprise. It has been speculated that Tebow could run zone-read plays better than Philadelphia's four current quarterbacks.

Tebow elicited interest from millions of fans in large part for his public displays of religious faith on and off the field, a head-bowing genuflecting move on one knee that became known as 'Tebowing' in the wake of his success.

In 2011, Tebow began the season as a backup with the Denver Broncos but was given a chance to start after a 1-4 start. 

Tebow sparked a string of come-from-behind victories and led Denver into the playoffs and an upset of Pittsburgh in the first round.

But Tebow's 47-per cent pass-completion rate was the worst in the NFL that season and when the Broncos signed Peyton Manning in 2012, Tebow became expendable. He was sent to the Jets in a trade.

Tebow was seldom used even as Jets starter Mark Sanchez struggled. He was released in 2013 having thrown only eight passes and run just 32 times in his lone season in New York.

The New England Patriots made Tebow one of their final roster cuts in 2013 and he spent last year as a college gridiron television commentator when no NFL team wanted him.

Tebow was being assessed by an Eagles team that features Sanchez, who joined Philadelphia after his own departure from the Jets, and Sam Bradford, a quarterback who missed most of last season with a torn left knee ligament.

Bradford was the second sophomore player to win the Heisman Trophy as the top college player, doing so in 2008. Tebow had been the first in 2007.

Tebow has an 8-6 record as an NFL starting quarterback with a career 48-per cent completion rate for 2,422 yards with 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions.

Schefter announced on Twitter that the Eagles decided not to sign Tebow, but left the option open. 

'Tim Tebow has come and gone from Philadelphia. Team is not planning to sign him at this time. We'll see if anything changes,' he wrote. 

Kelly's remake of the Eagles' roster has included trading star running back LeSean McCoy to Buffalo, then signing Offensive Player of the Year DeMarco Murray to replace him. 

Clearly, Kelly - who took over personnel duties after last season - is unafraid to look anywhere for possible upgrades.

Although Tebow had some success in Denver, his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the NFL. His strength has been running the ball or improvising.

There's also been some thought that Tebow might switch to tight end or fullback, although he has balked at such a move in the past. The Eagles have depth at tight end, but no fullbacks on the roster.
