It has been claimed that Sheridan Smith is dating Greg Wood – months after the married father of three separated from his wife.

And the 36-year-old Hollyoaks star appeared to confirm the rumours, when he called Sheridan, 33, 'babe' as he openly congratulated her on Twitter for her National Television Awards win on Wednesday. 

But it looks like he also helped her celebrate in person as the pair were spotted together outside the bash, held at London's The O2, as Sheridan enjoyed a cigarette before they reportedly left for her North London home and weren't seen again until 6am the next morning.

Greg was by Sheridan's side as she took a cigarette break outside the venue and they looked quite cosy while chatting with some friends. 

At one stage he leaned in and put his arm around her as they shared an embrace, unconcerned that they were not alone. 

It was the first high profile outing for the pair since they allegedly started dating and a successful one for Sheridan, who claimed the Best Drama Performance accolade for her starring role in TV biopic Cilla.

The next day Greg - best known for his role as Trevor Royle in the popular teen soap – took to Twitter to congratulate Sheridan, writing:  '@Sheridansmith1 well deserved babe, proud of you X.'

Meanwhile, Sheridan's  alleged romance with 36-year-old Greg is believed to have 'stunned' the actor's wife of ten-years, Catherine. 

A source told The Sun on Sunday: 'Her split from Greg was far from amicable, but they were together for a long time. The two of them aren't even divorced yet, though they are going through the process.'

It's understood that Sheridan and Greg forged a close friendship after exchanging a series of messages on micro-blogging site Twitter shortly after he moved out of the Stockport home he shared with his wife and three children last summer.

The source added: 'Catherine saw that he and Sheridan had been in touch on Twitter, but at that stage it seemed just a few casual flirty messages.'

However, the insider alleged that the two later met up and things progressed from there.
