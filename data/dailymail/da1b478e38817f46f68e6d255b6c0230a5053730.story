With at least seven million viewers expected to tune in to the finale of the Broadchurch detective series last night, executives at ITV can congratulate themselves on a winning programme.

But once the fans of the murder mystery finally found out who killed Danny Latimer, their next question was: Is there a second series?

And they won't be the only ones: shopkeepers, restaurateurs and hoteliers in the Dorset village of West Bay where Broadchurch is filmed are also hoping for another run after business boomed thanks to fans of the show coming in their droves.

Local businesses in West Bay on Dorset's Jurassic Coast are hoping for a second series of Broadchurch - as are fans

West Bay, in Dorset, has become popular with fans of Broadchurch who want to see where the series was filmed

The dramatic cliffs of West Bay have lent a stark backdrop to the gripping whodunnit series, starring David Tennant, which concluded last night.

And local businesses, which suffered last summer from a combination of poor weather and the distracting Olympic sailing event up the road in Weymouth, have profited from it.

West Bay's newsagent Richard Attrill, whose shop was filmed in the show, said: 'If I had a pound for every time the shop has been photographed, I'd close the shop.

West Bay has long been a destination for food-lovers, but now television viewers are flocking there, too

'I know people are coming here because of the series because they tell me.'

In the show, newsagent Jack Marshall killed himself in the fifth episode after being outed as a sex offender.  After the episode was broadcast, Mr Attrill put up a sign saying 'Under new management', and soon saw people taking photographs of his shop window.

He said the Olympics sailing in Weymouth had an obvious effect on tourist numbers in West Bay, leaving the village's car park practically empty.

West Bay is already known as a foodie
 destination, but local cafes, restaurants and shops have noticed a 
surge in visitor numbers thanks to Broadchurch.

Maurice
 Rist, who gave up his City job to sell food from a stall on the 
harbourside said people were fascinated by the real-life village behind 
the show, and Rachel Kingston, who runs Rachel's seafood cafe on the 
harbour wall has also noticed a positive effect.

A
 walking tour guide who will run Broadchurch-themed walks in Clevedon, 
near Bristol, where some of the town scenes were shot, says visitor 
numbers have soared thanks to the TV show.

Natalie Manifold, 28, from Literary Lyme Walking Tours in Lyme Regis, told the Times: 'I already have bookings for July, which is unusual so far in advance, and visits to my website have quadrupled.'

A
 spokesman for West Dorset District Council told MailOnline hits to the 
council's tourism website had more than tripled since this time last 
year, which they attributed to Broadchurch putting the village on the 
map.

Colin Wood said: 'West
 Dorset District Council’s tourism team has confirmed there were 100,000
 unique visits to visit-dorset.com in both March and April. This is the 
most unique visits the site has ever had - last year there were 31,000 
unique visits in March.'

Mr
 Wood said the show had showcased the 'fabulous Jurassic Coast and West 
Bay in particular', and said the all-star cast of Broadchurch had fallen
 for the area, too.

'David 
Tennant was quoted as saying “This is the only place you’d ever want to 
come on holiday”, Olivia Colman described the area as “idyllic” and 
Pauline Quirke said she had “absolutely fallen in love with the place”.

Grieving father Mark Latimer was the very first suspect in the case - could he be the killer?

Most of the characters have come under suspicion at some point over the course of the series, and bookies are taking bets on them all.  Here are the odds on the likely, and not so likely, suspects:

Ellie Miller's husband Joe, left, is the prime suspect in the murder

Joe Miller: With odds of 4/7, the mild-mannered husband of Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller is the favourite.

Tom Miller: The policewoman's son and friend of the murder victim, the odds on Tom having done it are 3/1.

Rev. Paul Coates: The odds on the local vicar and recovering alcoholic being to blame are 9/2.

Oliver Stevens: Odds on the ambitious local journalist having done it are 8/1.

Nigel Carter: The handyman certainly looks the part, and bookies are offering 10/1 on him being the culprit.

Steve Connelly: He seems to know a lot about the case but also wants to help the family: 10/1.

Jack Marshall: The convicted paedophile was the prime suspect until he committed suicide, but now we're not so sure. 14/1.

Mark Latimer:  Danny's grieving father was the prime suspect but he might just be guilty of having an affair. 20/1.

Dean Thomas: This druggie sixth-form student has odds of 22/1 on being the murderer.

Becca Fisher: The hotelier who had an affair with Danny's father ranks as an outsider at 25/1.

Susan Wright: The misanthropic cleaner found and hid Danny's skateboard after he died, but is only rated at 33/1.

OUTSIDERS: Danny's devastated mother Chloe Latimer, the kind local newspaper editor Maggie Radcliffe, and police officers DI Alec Hardy, played by David Tennant, and DS Ellie Miller are all assumed by fans of the show to be in the clear.

But Broadchurch scriptwriter Chris Chibnall has promised a 'highly-charged conclusion', so the field remains open....
