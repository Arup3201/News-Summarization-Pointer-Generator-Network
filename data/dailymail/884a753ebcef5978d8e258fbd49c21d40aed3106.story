For someone who had an affair with her husband's brother, Natasha Giggs should really stop her mudslinging.

Especially when it's directed at the woman she betrayed - that woman being her sister-in-law Stacey.

After a blazing row in the street between Natasha, Stacey and her Manchester United player husband, Natasha took to her Twitter page to make horrible comments about his long-suffering wife.

Twitter insult: Natasha (left) called Stacey a 'lapdog' on her page on the social networking site after they argued as they ran into each other for the first time since Giggs' cheating was exposed

Natasha, who is estranged from husband Rhodri, Ryan's younger brother, wrote that Stacey was a 'lapdog', presumably in reference to the fact that she has decided to stick by her cheating husband after news of his affairs broke.

She wrote: 'That awkward moment when you bump into the one person you never thought you would see again... with his lapdog!!'

And Natasha, who revealed her affair 
with Giggs after it was alleged he cheated on his wife with former Miss 
Wales Imogen Thomas, continued: 'Had a blazing row in the street he is 
such a t*t!!!'

Online brawl: The scathing row continued on twitter with Natasha branding Giggs a 'tit' and his wife Stacey a 'lapdog'

Earlier this week, Ryan, Stacey and Natasha bumped into each other outside a 
Manchester restaurant andit soon turned into a public slanging match.

Eyewitnesses, who said it was like a scene from Shameless, said drivers stopped their 
cars to look at the blazing row as the Manchester United player's wife 
screamed 'you s**g' at her former sister-in-law, The Sun reported.

Giggs shot back at Natasha: 'You do realise I never cared about you, it was just sex to me', The Sun reported.

As the argument outside Tung Fong Chinese
restaurant in Worsley, Greater Manchester, continued Giggs, 37, told 
his wife Stacey, 34, to wait in the car as he lambasted Natasha for 
selling her story.

Natasha, 29, who was married to 
Ryan's younger brother Rhodri, laughed and just told the footballer she 
used the six-figure sum to pay for breast implants, according to the paper.

The trio had not seen each other 
since June, when news of the affair - including how mother-of-two 
Natasha aborted Giggs's child - broke.

Betrayal: Natasha was married to Giggs brother Rhodri

They
had carried out their affair, which began in 2003 - the same year Giggs
married wife Stacey Cooke, 32 - in a string of hotels and worked it 
around the Premiership fixtures list.

The risky behaviour meant the pair were 
almost caught by their spouses and family and friends became suspicious 
about the nature of their relationship.

Two weeks after Natasha claims she had her termination she married Rhodri, 34, in Las Vegas.

Gagged: Big Brother star Imogen Thomas was slapped with an injunction by Giggs as he tried to hush up their affair

The newly married couple then threw a belated reception in September for family and friends in Manchester. 

Ryan was not invited because of an ongoing feud with Rhodri.

Instead the footballer, who is estimated to be worth £34million, went clubbing in London.

This was the night he met Big Brother star Imogen Thomas and allegedly began the affair which would ultimately lead to his family man image being shattered.

Giggs was named as the footballer who had taken out an injunction to silence the Welsh glamour model in May.
