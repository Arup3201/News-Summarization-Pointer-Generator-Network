Need some help and inspiration deciding who to back at Cheltenham?

Sportsmail's Peter Scudamore and Marcus Townend reveal their favourites while Sky Sports News HQ presenter Alex Hammond and other celebrities have also shared their tips for the Festival.

PETER SCUDAMORE 

Eight-time champion jockey and rider of 13 Festival winners 

DOUVAN

(Supreme Novices’ Hurdle, 1.30)

Rated one of the best horses Irish trainer Willie Mullins  has brought to the meeting, which is saying something.

Having beaten some very decent opposition without coming off the bridle, it is impossible to truly measure his merit but the vibes are strong and he should be able to successfully start what could be an amazing afternoon for Mullins and his stable jockey Ruby Walsh. L’Ami Serge looks best of the British but that might not be good enough.

BEST ODDS: 13-8

UN DE SCEAUX

(Arkle Challenge Trophy Chase, 2.05)

Another Mullins-trained hot-pot. Fell when clear on his steeplechasing debut but has since pulverised some good performers including Tuesday’s rival Clarcam by 15 lengths in January. Some fear his temperament might get the better of him given the atmosphere but he was far more tractable for Walsh on that last run.

BEST ODDS: 8-13

THE NEW ONE

(Champion Hurdle, 3.20)

My pick to derail the Mullins bandwagon by beating hot favourite Faugheen and his two-time champion stablemate Hurricane Fly.

Some say the gelding trained by Nigel Twiston-Davies and ridden by his son Sam wasn’t as unlucky as he looked last year when almost brought down at the third hurdle and his failure to keep up on the run to the home turn was crucial. But that ignores how significant a loss of momentum and rhythm can be in a top-quality race.

BEST ODDS: 7-2

ANNIE POWER

(OLBG mares’ hurdle, 4.00)

Mullins has won this race with Quevega for the last six years and this mare, whose only career defeat came in last year’s World Hurdle, could be even better.

Kept off the track all season by injury but only needs to be near her best to beat a field of inferior rivals.

BEST ODDS: 8-13

The New One is Peter Scudamore's tip to beat favourite Faugheen and Hurricane Fly

MARCUS TOWNEND

SEEDLING

(Supreme Novices’ Hurdle, 1.30)

Fair form last season but really flourished this term winning all three races. That includes giving weight and a length-and-a-half beating to Tuesday’s rival Some Plan at Cheltenham in December. The run looks even better when you factor in his bad jumping error at the fourth flight. Trainer Warren Greatrex has his string back in good form after quiet spell.

BEST ODDS: 20-1

SGT RECKLESS

(Arkle Challenge Trophy, 2.05)

Lacks experience, racing over fences only once when winning at Uttoxeter in October having been kept away from the worst of the winter ground. Winning a Flat race on the all-weather is unconventional preparation but Mick Channon’s gelding was a fast finishing fourth in last year’s Supreme Novices’ Hurdle and has frame claims if he can pounce off a strong pace set by favourite Un De Sceaux.

BEST ODDS: 16-1

L’UNIQUE

(OLBG Mares’ Hurdle, 4.00)

Annie Power is the red-hot favourite for the race but Alan King’s L’Unique looks a great each-way option. She is a Grade One winner who peaks in the spring and was third in this race last year. She also has a decent weight pull for her course defeat by Polly Peachum.

BEST ODDS: 16-1 

Sgt Reckless was a fast finishing fourth in last year's Supreme Novices' Hurdle

AND THE CELEBS... 

Here's who the celebs are backing in the Champion Hurdle.

............................................................................ 

SIR PETER O’SULLEVAN - Legendary racing commentator 

JEZKI

Faugheen might be anything but at the prices, last year’s winner looks the each-way bet.

............................................................................ 

JAMES SIMPSON-DANIEL - Former rugby union star turned bookmaker

FAUGHEEN

I have been a fan all season and those who say he has beaten nothing are wrong.

........................................................................... 

HAYLEY TURNER - Professional jockey

FAUGHEEN

Willie Mullins’ star gelding is one of my strongest fancies for the whole of the Festival week.

ALEX HAMMOND - Sky Sports News HQ presenter

THE NEW ONE

Unlucky in this race last year and I prefer to back a proven hurdler rather than one with potential. He should have a better race this time round.

IWAN THOMAS - Former 400m athlete and TV presenter

FAUGHEEN

The popular choice but I hope he can live up to the nickname ‘Faugheen the Machine’.
