Anne Hathaway dazzled at the London premiere of her new film Les Miserables in a backless, batwinged Givenchy gown that was pure glamour.

The star teamed the dramatic dress with immaculate hair and make-up and a glittering manicure using a nail varnish brand that's available at your local Debenhams!

Of course, as red carpet royalty Anne's nail designs were created by a top manicurist and included special gems, but her nail artist Jenni Draper has spilled the beans and revealed to FEMAIL that the polish she used costs just £4.30.

Bespoke red carpet nails are a huge 
beauty trend this season: at the British Fashion Awards Lily Allen had 
hers painted in an art deco style and Alexa Chung went for a leather and
skulls combination by nails inc which now has a waiting list of almost 1000.

Nail artist Jenni Draper is an ambassador for polish brand Mavala and she created a modern take on the classic French manicure with a Christmassy twist for Anne.

Jenni said: 'Anne really loves her nails so we worked closely together to decide on a
look that would complement her stunning gown for the red carpet.

'I 
created a modern take on the French manicure using Mavala’s Reno, a 
delicate pink tone for the base and Mavala’s Silver nail polish to 
create striking tips.

'To finish the look I blended layers of Mavala’s 
Sparkling Silver with rhinestones and crystals to embellish the ring 
finger,' she said.

Anne isn't the only A-list fan of Mavala, Strictly Come Dancing beauty Kimberley Walsh has been sporting the varnish on the dance floor and Davina McCall and Alexandra Burke are also fans.

Speaking about Mavala's cuticle oil, Kimberley said: ‘It’s really good for dry, rough 
cuticles. It keeps them supple and soft and helps my nail varnish stay 
on for longer,’ she says.

Mavala nail polishes are £4.30 each from John Lewis and Debenhams.
