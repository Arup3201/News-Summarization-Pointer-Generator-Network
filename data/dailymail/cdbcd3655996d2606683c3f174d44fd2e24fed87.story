When the rest of us are steering clear of danger, Mike Hollingshead is seeking it out to document some of the the most extreme weather Mother Nature can throw at us.  

Storm chaser Hollingshead, from Nebraska, goes in search of tornadoes, supercells, lightning bolts and other natural phenomena throughout the United States' mid-west where extreme weather wreaks havoc.

The 38-year-old  drives about 20,000 miles every year trying to find and shoot weather patterns that can rip up crops and blow houses away. 

These images, from lightning strikes in South Dakota's Badlands to the supercell that produced a record volleyball-sized hail stone, are the incredible fruits of his labour.

Mike Hollingshead risks his life chasing storms through the mid-west of the United States to capture images such as these two lightning bolts

Hollingshead says this supercell produced world record eight-inch hail stone on July 23, 2010, in Vivian, South Dakota

The rush he gets is, understandably, immense. 'Seeing a supercell take on other worldly structures has its own way of amazing you,' Mike says. 'You can't believe you are seeing moisture take on such shapes and power.'

Hollingshead speaks matter-of-factly about the risks associated with his job as he recalling a moment when storms collided and lightning bombarded the town of Valentine in Nebraska's north near the South Dakota state line.

'At first it wasn't that great to look at, but the lightning frequency was almost scary - It was probably averaging a bolt to the ground every second,' he says of a supercell formed near the Black Hills of South Dakota.

'As it was crossing the interstate it began to look a bit more angry. Then a huge nasty hail core bomb formed. It really looked like an upside down bomb went off over the interstate. It was just a white wall of hail and looked especially nasty on the radar too.

The Storm Prediction Center says supercells are usually thunderstorms, but not always, that 'contain updrafts that rotate about a vertical axis'. This rotating updraft means they can 'overcome the self-limiting mechanisms that bring demise to regular storms'.

Destructive winds, huge hailstones and  tornadoes can come from supercells. 

'Most strong to violent tornadoes are associated with supercells,' says the SPC.

'As it entered the town of Valentine it got cut off by a new storm firing right next to it. As I drove through town the most intense barrage of lightning bolts was peppering the town. It was especially frightening to the northeast side of town.'

In a bid to get the perfect shot, Mike tests the limits of Mother Nature to the point he is sometimes at her mercy. As was the case here. 

'It wasn't scary until right after I took the picture of the two lightning bolts,' he recalls. 'I was trying to get those lightning shots knowing I was running out of time to bail south before that gust flung east over the highway. 

'I thought I had enough time to snap some and then zoom south really fast. But no, that thing came racing over the highway much faster than it had been doing all along.

'Suddenly I was in very strong outflow winds buried in rain and hardly able to stay on the road as the winds push me east. But the possible tornado could have been in there, so I didn't have much choice in slowing down.'
