There's nothing more British than cod and chips – or so it seemed for decades when the white fish was the nation’s favourite. But no more.

Cash-strapped, time-tight and health-conscious Britons are opting instead for salmon, and sales of  the once-luxury fish are now outstripping its rival by nearly a third, according to Asda.

Retailers point to the economic downturn as one reason behind the decline in cod’s popularity, as people choose to save money and eat at home instead of getting takeaways from the chip shop.

Naughty but nice: A calorie-packed portion of battered cod and chips has long been a favourite of hungry Britons, but new research suggests healthy salmon is now overtaking the white fish in the popularity stakes

Sales of frozen fish have boomed, with freezer packets of salmon proving a huge hit with shoppers. But budget is not thought to be the only reason behind the boost in sales – with the public also tempted by salmon’s low levels of fat and high protein and omega-3 content.

An Asda spokeswoman said: ‘With its versatility and speed of cooking, salmon has now really cemented its status with families.’

Salmon isn’t the only fish winning the nation’s hearts – some less well-known species are also becoming popular. Among them is the gurnard, which has seen sales quadruple since January.
