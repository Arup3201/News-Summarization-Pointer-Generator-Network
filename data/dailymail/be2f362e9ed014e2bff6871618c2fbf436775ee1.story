The father of a teenage boy who died after stepping in front of a high-speed train with his girlfriend  in an apparent suicide pact has said he cannot stop crying.

Mert Karaoglan, 18, and Charleigh Disbrey, 15, were found dead near a busy commuter station in Hertfordshire.

The A-level student's father Sakru, 48, said his son had told him he was 'going out for one or two hours' on Monday evening but he never returned.

Today the grieving father, supported by relatives, visited the scene in Borehamwood where his son died on Monday evening.

Anguish: Mert Karaoglan's father Sakru is comforted by a friends as he visits the site where his son and Charleigh Disbrey were found dead

Mert and talented musician Charleigh -
known as CJ - were under the arches of a brick footbridge in 
Borehamwood when they were hit by a locomotive travelling at more than 
90mph.

Investigators later found two notes on
the body of Mert and a single note on
Charleigh, a talented musician who said she 'would give anything to be 
famous'.

Sakru was accompanied by around a dozen friends and relatives as he visited the bridge today.

He was too distraught to speak and Mert's cousin Ali Kalak said that the father had been crying for two days.

Anguish: Mert's father Sakru said his son had told him he would be back in an hour or two when he went out on Monday evening

Mr Kalak said: 'All his father does is cry all day. He does not eat. He tells us he was such a good boy. It is his only son. He loved him so much. Everything he wanted he gave him.

'We want to know what happened. There are so many questions and no answers.'

Sakru told The Sun that his son went out on Monday evening promising to be back soon.

'We told him not to be out late,' he said. We 
were waiting and waiting. Then the police came round to see us at nine 
this morning. I can't stop crying.'

He added: 'He was a happy person - everything seemed okay.'

Victim: Charleigh, known as CJ, had uploaded a haunting rendition of herself singing the David Guetta hit song Titanium just days before she died

Floral tributes: More flowers which were left outside the gates of Hertswood Academy. The teenagers' headteacher described them as 'talented, hard-working and well-respected'

Grief: Tributes left outside the school for the two teenagers. The deaths were announced in a special assembly

Mert's parents Hatice, 52, and Sakru are believed to originate from Turkey.

Today Charleigh's mother Sandie Barnes said she was enduring a nightmare, and wrote that she just wanted her daughter back.

She wrote on a tribute site: 'Charleigh my Baby my Angel, I just can’t believe you have been taken from me like this, u are my beautiful very talented little girl!! Please someone wake me up from this nightmare. Please I just want my daughter back.'

The deaths of Mert and Charleigh, who attended Hertswood Academy, are not being treated as suspicious.

Charleigh had 
auditioned for the television shows Britain's Got Talent and Must Be The
Music in the past.

The GCSE pupil had posted videos of herself on YouTube playing 
an acoustic guitar and had written on her website that she wanted to 
become a musician 'to be remembered'.

Just days before her death she had uploaded a haunting rendition of herself singing the David Guetta hit song Titanium.  

Charleigh's grandmother and sister were among wellwishers who left flowers close to the scene.

Tribute: A note from a woman, believed to be Charleigh's aunt, who wrote: 'I will never forget you. You will always be in our hearts forever. I love you so much'

Floral tributes: A row of bouquets of flowers left for Charleigh Disbrey and Mert Karaoglan in Borehamwood

Tributes: Flowers were left near the scene where Charleigh and Mert died. Friends said they were boyfriend and girlfriend

Tribute: A montage of pictures of Mert Karaoglan put together by a friend and left near the scene in Borehamwood

Her grandmother wrote: 'My beautiful granddaughter. You are loved more than words can say. Lots of love Nanny.'

Her sister wrote: 'To my Sis. Charleigh love you 4ever. Miss you everyday. Gone but not forgotten. Sophie.'

Another note at the scene read: 'To our beautiful Charleigh, words can't describe how missed you are. We love you so much princess. Daddy and Holly xxxx.'

Another read: 'In loving memory of a dear sister. We miss you so much xx. We love you forever. Big cuddles Archie, Emmy and Mollie xxxxxx.'

Friends said the pair were in a relationship.

They
were struck at about 9pm on Monday by a London First Capital Connect 
service just outside Elstree and Borehamwood station. No passengers were
on board.

A Network Rail source said: 'They stepped out together on to the track. Three notes were found on their bodies.'

Their school's headteacher, Peter Gillett, said yesterday: 'As a close community, obviously we are devastated by this tragedy. Both students were talented, hard-working and well-respected members of our academy.

'Our thoughts are with their families at this most difficult time. We are supporting our students and staff in coping with this terrible loss.'

Floral tributes to the teenagers and cards were left outside the school's gates.

One card read: 'To Mert, thinking of you always, bless your soul and may you rest in peace friend.' Another read: 'Sleep tight angel. RIP CJ and Mert, never forgotten.'

Friends of the pair took to social media to express their shock and grief.

One girl said: 'R.I.P Cj and Mert such wonderful and talented people, you will be truly missed xxxxx.'

Another wrote: 'Situations like this just do not make sense, RIP Mert and CJ.'

BTP is continuing its investigations into the incident.

Superintendent Phil Wilkinson said yesterday: 'Although my officers are continuing their investigations as part of our work to prepare a file for the local coroner, there are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances and no one else is believed to have been involved.

'Colleagues from Hertfordshire Constabulary are also in a local secondary school to provide comfort and support to students and staff at this very difficult time.'
