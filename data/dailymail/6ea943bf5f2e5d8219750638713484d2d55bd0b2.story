Several people are unaccounted for after a fire gutted out two five-story apartment buildings in upstate New York on Friday, authorities said.

With temperatures in the area reaching below freezing in Schenectady, firefighters - and the buildings - were left covered in ice as they tried to hose down the fire.

The fire broke out at about 2am on Friday and left seven people injured - one who jumped from the fifth floor to escape the fire, emergency officials said.

Firefighters continued to hose down the smoldering remains of the fire throughout Friday during since-digit temperatures.

Though authorities don't have a specific number of missing people, they said 60 have been displaced, according to WNYT.

The fire first broke out in a building across from city hall and spread next door. Both buildings had apartments on upper levels and commercial space on the ground floor. 

The cause of the fire is unknown.

Fire Chief Ray Senecal said three Schenectady firefighters were injured as they fought the fire, according to the Daily Gazette. He added that the cold weather did not help put out the fire.

'With the heavy ice, shoveling out hydrants ahead of time paid off. But we had some problems with some hydrants,' he told the Daily Gazette.  

And while the firefighters got covered in ice as they battled the fire, it appears that winter is holding up in much of the country.

Temperatures of ten to 30 degrees below average were expected from the South to Northeast, along with heavy snow in the Mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service.

The late-winter storm means school is canceled yet again for students in several states, and many households found themselves without power.

State offices and legislatures shut down, too. In the Washington area, federal offices were open but on a two-hour delay, and workers were given telecommuting options.

Residents hoped the storm would be this tough winter's last wallop, with spring bringing relief soon, but across the country it doesn't look like that's the case.  

Record-breaking cold gripped the United States from Texas to New York on Friday, causing school closures and snarled traffic, as a storm that dropped roughly two feet of snow on some eastern parts of the country moved out to sea.

Forecasts called for temperatures ten to 30 degrees below normal through Friday in the eastern and southern United States, with unusual cold continuing through the weekend.

Snowfall and blustery weather forced public schools in the metropolitan areas of New York and the District of Columbia to cancel classes.

Just shy of 800 flights had been canceled and nearly 2,300 delayed nationwide as of Friday afternoon, according to FlightAware.com. On Thursday, there were 4,957 cancellations and 4,528 delays.

The National Weather Service warned of flooding and told commuters from the lower Mississippi valley to the mid-Atlantic to be wary of dangerous road conditions created by the snow, ice and slush.

Though it's been a cold start to the weekend with lots of snow, warmth will build in the west and central states in the upcoming week

Temperatures are dragging at around 30 degrees below average across the country and snow is still falling in most states

Low temperatures shattered records in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York, said NWS meteorologist Bruce Terry.

'Even in the deep South, it's very, very cold,' Terry said. 'It will be another cold night tonight. But we are at the end of this record-breaking cold spell.'

Saranac Lake in New York's Adirondack Mountains was the coldest spot in the country on Friday, with the mercury registering minus 29 degrees Fahrenheit, he said.

Cities reaching new lows for the day included Detroit at zero degrees, breaking the previous record of two degrees, set in 1901.

The temperature in Austin, Texas, reached 21 degrees, breaking the previous record of 28, set in 2011.

In Kentucky, where cities were buried under as many as 23 inches of snow, Governor Steve Beshear declared a state of emergency on Thursday as traffic was halted on interstate highways and motorists were stranded.

Stalled tractor-trailers were removed from Interstate 65 overnight, and traffic was inching along the major commuter route by Friday morning.

Parts of Massachusetts got up to 12 inches of snow, but Boston only received trace amounts, NWS meteorologist Bob Oravec said. 

The city would have needed two inches to break its annual snowfall record of nearly 108 inches set in the year that ended in June 1996. 

In the upcoming week, however, central and western states are expected to warm up, with cold air remaining north in Canada and a few northern states. 

Temperatures could reach as high as 47 in Chicago and 86 degrees in phoenix. Winter is finally showing signs of ending as cold air is remaining north in the upcoming week. 

Though it's been a rough start to the weekend with all of the snow, spring - or at least signs of it - are just around the corner.  

Thousands of motorists endured  waits on Thursday lasting nearly 24 hours for some as parts of Kentucky saw up to two feet of snow
