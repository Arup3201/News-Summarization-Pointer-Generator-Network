New AC Milan coach Pippo Inzaghi is aiming to make his stint in charge memorable on the pitch, and he is looking to turn heads off it as well, judging by the club's clobber.

Inzaghi took a group of his players to the Dolce & Gabbana store in New York where Milan are conducting their pre-season tour and they brought back memories of Liverpool's infamous 'Spice Boys' who wore cream Armani suits before the 1996 FA Cup final.

Liverpool lost that final 1-0 to Manchester United, but Milan are sure to hope the look works out better for them.

The Rossoneri will face Olympiacos, Manchester City and Liverpool while in the United States, meaning Inzaghi is not being ushered into the job gently.

The former Milan striker replaced Clarence Seedorf after the Dutchman was sacked less than six months into his reign after failing to qualify for Europe and rumours of dressing-room splits.

He has already lost Kaka to MLS side Orlando and there are rumours that Mario Balotelli could also be set to leave the San Siro this summer.

If that is the case Inzaghi will need his team to put in some performances as sharp as their look.
