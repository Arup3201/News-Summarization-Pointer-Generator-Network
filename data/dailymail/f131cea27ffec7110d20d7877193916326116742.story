Captured: Libyan authorities say they plan to put Colonel Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi on trial, and - despite requests from The Hague - have so far taken no action to hand him over

Pressure is mounting on Libya to hand over the son of former
dictator Colonel Gaddafi after the International Criminal Court issued an
official ruling calling for his surrender.

Amnesty International has backed the ICC in the diplomatic tug
of war with the Libyan authorities who still want to try Saif al-Islam Gaddafi themselves.

The ousted dictator's second son, once considered the heir
apparent, was finally arrested in November last year by rebel fighters in
Libya's remote southern desert while trying to flee to neighbouring Niger.

He was indicted in June along with his father and the
Gaddafi regime's intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senoussi for killing and
persecuting civilians.

Libyan authorities say they plan to put Saif on trial, and -
despite requests from The Hague - have so far taken no action to hand him over.

In a written ruling issued yesterday, judges at the court
rejected a request by Libya to postpone handing over Saif and urged the
country’s rulers to 'comply with its obligations to enforce the arrest warrant and
proceed immediately with the surrender'.

Libyan authorities have told the International Criminal
Court they plan to challenge its jurisdiction in the case and that their desire
to try Saif al-Islam inside Libya remained unchanged.

Ousted: Former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi was killed in a 'mob execution' last but his son Saif al-Islam who was captured now faces trial in over war crimes in either The Hague or Libya    

In a news conference Government spokesman Nasser al-Manee said: 'The justice
ministry announces that the central prison preparations have been completed.
They are ready for the trial of Saif al-Islam and it will be soon.'

Libyan authorities say that as soon as construction work on a special prison in Tripoli
is completed, Saif al-Islam will be moved there and that
his trial will start.

The ICC says it has jurisdiction in the case and that a U.N.
Security Council Resolution obliges Libya to cooperate. It has warned that
Tripoli's failure to hand Saif al-Islam over could result in it being reported
to the Council.  

Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the Court’s chief prosecutor, told The Associated
Press: 'The good thing here is one year ago Saif Gaddafi was threatening people
... now he's arrested and the court is discussing his destiny.'

Determined: Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the International Criminal Court¿s chief prosecutor, has warned Libya that failure to hand Saif al-Islam over could result in it being reported to the UN Council

‘The fact that the court is ruling, and Libyans - I’m sure
they will accept it or appeal or debate it - but they will engage the court to
have it make the final decision. So that is showing how the world changes in 10
years.'

Amnesty International has echoed the ICC’s demands saying
the Libyan authorities must hand 39-year-old Gaddafi over 'without further
delay'.

The organisation says that since his capture in November,
Saif al-Islam Gadaffi has been held in isolation in a secret location in the town of
Zintan without effective access to a lawyer or facilities to communicate with
his family.

Saif al-Islam Gaddafi is wanted for crimes against humanity in connection
to the brutal crackdown on demonstrations ordered by his father's government.

Order: Judges at the International Criminal Court rejected a request by Libya to postpone handing over Saif and urged the country¿s rulers to 'proceed immediately with his surrender'

According to Amnesty, the justice system in Libya continues
to be virtually paralysed and criminal proceedings are yet to start against
thousands of detainees, held mainly outside the framework of the law and
accused of war crimes and other violations in relation to the conflict.

Amnesty International Justice Team Head Marek Marczyński
said: ‘This clear ruling by the ICC judges should effectively bring an end to
the long-running saga over the fate of Saif al-Islam.

‘Libya must act on the ICC’s decision and surrender Saif
al-Islam al-Gaddafi without further delay.

'An unfair trial before a Libyan
court where the accused could face the death penalty is no way to guarantee
justice and accountability.

'The ICC has indicated that it could refer any failure of
the Libyan government to comply with the court’s ruling to the UN Security
Council.

'In the absence of a functioning Libyan court system and for
as long as the Libyan justice system remains weak and unable to conduct
effective investigations, the ICC will be crucial in delivering accountability
in Libya.'

New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) also believes Saif
al-Islam would receive a fairer and safer trial in the Netherlands.    

Richard Dicker, HRW's international justice program director said: ‘Today's decision means that the authorities in Libya must
start making arrangements to surrender Saif al-Islam to the court.'
