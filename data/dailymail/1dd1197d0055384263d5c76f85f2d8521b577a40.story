With matches as richly entertaining as this one, even UEFA could warm to the Premier League Under 21 International Cup.

West Ham’s youngsters tasted defeat in their first experience of European competition as Athletic Bilbao claimed the points but both teams played their full part in an eight-goal thriller.

This new 16-team competition, set up in defiance of UEFA interference, will offer all kinds of intriguing contests between the best of English talent and the continent’s production lines.

And on a soggy evening at Upton Park, it was one-nil to the Europeans - but only just.

The Basque club, who take enormous pride in their ‘Cantera’ policy of only fielding players from their own region, looked vastly superior in the first half and goals from Jorge Luis Garcia and Aitor Seguin, followed by a Joshua Pask own goal, saw them establish a commanding 3-1 lead.

But the Hammers, with a proud academy track record of their own, had equalised at 1-1 through Mathias Fanimo and stayed in touch thanks to late goals from Elliot Lee and Kieran Bywater.

It meant Bilbao needed two late goals of their own - from Luis Garcia again and then Mario Basco - to claim the spoils and take an early advantage in a group that also features Fulham and PSV Eindhoven.

A hastily-arranged opening game, played before a sparse crowd of a few hundred hardy souls who braved torrential rain, hardly felt like history in the making but the Premier League deserve immense credit for getting this idea off the ground.

Concerned that a continental competition at Under 21 level would impact on the Under 19 Youth League, itself only in its second season, UEFA had scuppered the initial masterplan of staging games right across Europe.

But the Premier League persevered, adroitly outmaneuvering the UEFA red tape and regulations by playing all the matches in England under their own jurisdiction.

A worthy tournament is born, and let’s hope many stars of the future flourish in it. They couldn’t have asked for a better start.

The two teams posed for a photograph together ahead of the kick-off - a nice souvenir for the annals - and the only thing that remained was to see who would have the honour of scoring the International Cup’s first goal. 

We didn’t have to wait long to find out. Inside two minutes, Bilbao’s very first attack had the Hammers defence slipping and sliding, allowing Luis Garcia to pinch the ball ahead of grounded goalkeeper Raphael Spiegel and roll it into an empty net. 

The hosts responded very well and a nicely-worked move down the left involving Elliot Lee and Jordan Brown led to the unmarked Matthias Fanimo curling a shot over the bar.

Winger Djair Parfitt-Williams then struck the outside of the post after a moment of hesitation in the Bilbao defence saw him connect with Danny Whitehead’s perfect through ball.

West Ham were on top and they equalised on 18 minutes. Lewis Page combined well with Parfitt-Williams on the left and his deep cross found Fanimo unmarked. He found the net via a deflection and it was England 1-1 Spain. 

Not for long. Straight from the kick-off, Bilbao won a free-kick wide on the right and Seguin had only one thought in his mind. His immaculate inswinger evaded everyone and nestled in the net at the back stick. Think Angel Di Maria for Manchester United against QPR a few weeks ago, albeit a little closer in.

West Ham were again unbowed by a setback - Fanimo was found at the back post again, this time by Lee, but Alejandro Remiro blocked at his near post.

The miss proved costly as Bilbao claimed a third before half-time. West Ham were again guilty of loose defending and Urtzi Iriondo at the back post drilled across goal, the ball hitting Pask and then Emmanuel Onariase as it ricocheted in.

This new competition, created despite strong opposition from UEFA, brings together eight U21 Premier League teams and eight development sides from the continent.

European football’s governing body blocked the initial proposals to have a tournament along similar lines with games played right across the continent, fearing it would overlap with their Youth League competition for U19s.

But the Premier League have managed to out manoeuvre UEFA by staging all matches at English venues.

As well as West Ham, the English clubs involved in the tournament are Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Leicester, Manchester City, Norwich, and Sunderland.

Benfica, Borussia Monchengladbach, Celtic, Schalke, Porto, PSV Eindhoven, and Villarreal join Bilbao on the list of teams participating from outside England.

Group matches will be played between October 15 and January 31 with all games organised by the Premier League.

The groups have been drawn as follows:

Group A: Chelsea, Norwich City, Porto, Borussia Monchengladbach

Group B: Fulham, West Ham, Athletic Bilbao, PSV Eindhoven

Group C: Leicester City, Manchester City, Benfica, Sevilla

Group D: Everton, Sunderland, Celtic, Villarreal

The rain abated but Bilbao’s pressure didn’t. Spiegel saved well from Mario Barco and Pask was needed to hack away another shot close to the goalline.

But out of nothing, with just 13 minutes left, West Ham gained a lifeline when Lee pounced on Pask’s knock-down from a Kieran Bywater free-kick to apply a simple finish. And they could have equalised when Pask’s headed was blocked on the line.

Then a flurry of late goals kept the match swinging in the balance. First, Bilbao re-established their two-goal cushion when Garcia fired home from an indirect free-kick after Spiegel had picked up a backpass.

But as the clock ticked over into stoppage time, West Ham again had hope as Bywater fired high into the net from the edge of the box.

The hope didn’t last too long - Basco flung himself at a right-wing cross to beat Spiegel with a diving header and set the seal on the Basques’ win.
