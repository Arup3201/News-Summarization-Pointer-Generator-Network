As 2014 prepares to tick over into 2015, Sportsmail takes a look back at some of the key numbers in sport during the past 12 months.

1 The number of Grand Slam tennis men’s finals with NO representatives from the ‘Big 4’. That was when Marin Cilic beat Kei Nishikori in the US Open. The previous 38 finals had featured at least one of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray and often two of them. That last non-Big-4 final was Marat Safin’s four-set victory against Lleyton Hewitt in the Australian Open in January 2005.

4 British medals at the Sochi winter Olympic Games. A gold for Lizzy Yarnold in the skeleton, curling silver and bronze respectively for the men and women, and a bronze for Jenny Jones in the snowboard slopestyle — Britain’s first ever medal on snow in Games history — equalled the four medals Great Britain won at the inaugural Games in Chamonix in 1924. Hosts Russia won the most golds (13) and most medals in total (33).

4 Number of national individual Player of the Year awards for 2013-14 picked up by Luis Suarez from fellow players, football writers, supporters and the Premier League. That’s three more than the number of bites he made to ruin his year and reputation (again). He was also joint winner of the European golden shoe with Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo.
