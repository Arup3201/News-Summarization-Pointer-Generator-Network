Phil Jones is ready to return to full training as the England squad regroup on Monday to continue their World Cup preparations.

Jones is recovering from a shoulder injury which prompted manager Roy Hodgson to rate him as the player most in danger of missing the tournament in Brazil.

Recovery: Phil Jones is ready to return to full training as the England squad meet again

The Manchester United defender stepped up his recovery work last week in Portugal. He is ahead of schedule and should be fit to play in at least one of the warm-up friendlies before England fly to Rio de Janeiro.

Hodgson gave his players the weekend off after their training camp in the Algarve and they are back together on Monday at St Georgeâ€™s Park.

Jones is unlikely to be risked as England play Peru at Wembley on Friday but there are games against Ecuador and Honduras once the squad reach their training camp in Miami.

Hodgson is keen to see each of his 20 outfield players in action before they arrive in Brazil ahead of the opening game against Italy on June 14.

Line up: Steven Gerrard, Ricky Lambert, Jon Flanagan, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones take to the red carpet
