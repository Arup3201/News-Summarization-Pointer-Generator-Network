The news of a legal incestuous relationship between an 18-year-old girl and her father has prompted New Jersey to debate a law change.

It comes after the anonymous teenager in Great Lakes, Minnesota, said she and her fiance - her father - plan to move to New Jersey to marry. 

She described their two-year in an interview with Science of Us, from how they fell in love and the first time they had sex to their plans for marriage.

Speaking of their first time she said; 'There's a reason I lost my virginity to him - because I'd never felt comfortable with any other man.'

The controversial article has prompted a state assembly member to table legislation banning incest.

'It might be hard to believe, but incest among consenting adults is technically legal in New Jersey,' Assemblywoman Mary Pat Angelini, R-Monmouth, said in announcing the legislation, according to The Tennessean. 

'Obviously, these types of relationships violate our acceptable moral standards and should be banned.' 

The woman, who hails from the Great Lakes region, reconnected with her father when she was 16, this after 12 years of estrangement.

Her parents got pregnant on Prom night, and she grew up with her mother, who the young girl claims is bipolar.

Her father reached out to her on Facebook when she was in high school, and after the two met up she went to go stay with him for a week.

They had sex that week, her first time, and were soon dating. 

'It lasted for about an hour and there was a lot of foreplay,' she says. 

 Taking a stand: Mary Pat Angelini has proposed a change in the law to ban incest in New Jersey

'We both had orgasms. We are so similar, so it's so easy to sexually please each other. For example, we both love neck-biting. I've never been in a more passionate, loving, fulfilling situation.'

The two are not even hiding their situation, with many around them aware of what is going on between them. 

'Everyone on my mom's side of the family sees us as father and daughter,' she explains. 

'Those who know that he's my dad, and that we are engaged, include my father's parents (they can see we are happy together and they can't wait for us to have babies  they treat us just like any other couple), the woman we live with, and my best friend.'

The wedding has already been planned, and she will be telling her mother - after the two make the moved to New Jersey.

'We plan to move to New Jersey where we can be safe under the law, since adult incest isn't illegal there, and once I'm there I'll tell everyone,' she says. 

'I'll call my mom and let her know that we are in love and we are having children. If she wants to see her grandkids we'll send her money and she can drive to see us.' 

And while many people, and science, may argue that having a child with a family member can lead to genetic problems, she scoffs at this notion. 

'Everybody thinks that kids born in incestuous relationships will definitely have genetic problems, but that's not true,' she explains. 

'That happens when there's years of inbreeding, like with the royal family. Incest has been around as long as humans have.' 

That being said, she says her children will never learn how mommy and daddy first met.

'I don't want to give them any problems,' she says.
