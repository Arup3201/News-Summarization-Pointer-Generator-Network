A father-of-two was tied up, attacked and left to die in his flat just hours after winning £3,000 at a casino, it has been claimed today.

Mehmet Hassan, 56, of Islington, north London, was last seen leaving Palm Beach casino in Mayfair on Sunday after a big win at poker, which he allegedly celebrated by dining at nearby Nobu.

He went to the Michelin-starred restaurant with a woman aged 24 before returning home, and it was tonight feared the professional gambler could have been the victim of a pre-planned ‘honey-trap’.

Mr Hassan’s body was found by police 
on Monday at 8.40pm after his daughter called officers when he did not 
answer the door. Detectives said there was no sign of forced entry but 
he was assaulted.

He was 
said to have kept at least £20,000 in cash in his second-floor flat on a
 former council estate - and Metropolitan Police officers were trying to
 work out what had been stolen from the home.

His best friend Andrew ‘Giddy’ Perendes told the London Evening Standard today: ‘Mem was born with a pack of cards in his hands. He was a gambler since he was 11 years old.

‘We’ve known each other since we were eight. We have never worked, we have always gambled.’

Another
 friend said: ‘He always had money. He had a lot of money in the flat. I
 would say he had about £20,000. Whoever went there knew there was money
 in the flat. It was a set-up.’

Other companions praised him as a ‘generous’ man who grew up in Bethnal Green, east London, and has gambled since the age of 11. One described him as ‘the original loveable rogue’.

The friend told Standard journalists Simon Freeman, Anna Dubuis and David Churchill that a £3,000 win for Mr Hassan would have been ‘peanuts’ and not normally give him reason for ‘any kind of celebration’.

According to a worker at the casino, Mr Hassan was said to have visited Palm Beach up to four times a week - spending hundreds of pounds. No arrests have yet been made by police.

A spokesman for poker tournament organisers Genting Poker London said in a statement on Facebook: ‘Tragic news [of] the passing of Mehmet Hassan.

‘Mem will be badly missed by all those who played with him, and all of us at the Palm Beach. Hard to imagine the poker room without his wise cracks and his unique philosophy.’

And Cllr Paul Convery, Islington Council’s spokesman for community safety, said: ‘When these residents see this happening it has a chilling effect on a street or a block of flats.’

He told the Islington Gazette: ‘In the last year we had five murders in Islington, so when something like this happens it’s very out of the ordinary.’

Murder squad Detective Chief Inspector Andy Partridge said: ‘I would like to appeal to anyone who has seen any activity in and around this address to make contact with my officers.

‘In particular I would like help from the public who can assist with the movements of the victim between 7.30pm on Sunday and shortly before police found the victim on Monday.’
