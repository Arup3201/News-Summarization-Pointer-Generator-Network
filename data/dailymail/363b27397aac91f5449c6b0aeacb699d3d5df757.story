Dreams of airships that float through the skies have been largely confined to the scrap heap in recent times.

But now a Chinese engineer obsessed with the idea of reinventing the airship has unveiled an 'indestructible' inflatable plane that can be folded up and put in a suitcase when not needed.

He says his plane could be used for a variety of missions and, what's more, it won't break if it falls out of the sky.

Chinese engineer obsessed with the idea of reinventing the airship has unveiled an 'indestructible' inflatable plane that can be folded up and put in a suitcase when not needed. Pictured is the Chinese engineer Zhang Bingyan showing his design at the Tianjin International UAV Exhibition

Zhang Bingyan, 69, started working on his designs as an engineer with the Henan Normal University in Xinxiang, China in 1993.

He has now unveiled the results of more than 20 years of research in creating a 'soft body aeroplane' at the Tianjin International UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Exhibition.

His designs, looking a bit like an inflatable lilo, have nothing inside them but air.

A human-like ‘skin’ for aircraft - allowing them to detect any damage and ‘feel’ the world around them - is being developed by British experts.

Engineers at BAE Systems’ Advanced Technology Centre are investigating a ‘smart skin’ concept which could be embedded with tens of thousands of micro-sensors.

When applied to an aircraft, it will enable it to sense wind speed, temperature, physical strain and movement, far more accurately than current sensor technology allows.

The revolutionary ‘smart skin’ concept will enable aircraft to continually monitor their health, reporting back on potential problems before they become significant. 

The plane, called the Sf-1, has an average speed of 120 miles (120km) per hour and can fly up to 3,000 metres (10,000ft) with a maximum load of 25 kg (55lbs).

Aside from the engine that powers a rear-mounted propeller and wheels at the bottom the entire vehicle is made of a rubber composite and a high-strength fibre material. 

The flexibility of the plane also means that, even if it falls from the sky, it will likely survive an impact with the ground.

It costs between £20,000 and £30,000 ($32,400 and $48,600) to make.

One of the designs was able to reach spectacular speeds of up to 120 miles (190km) per hour, weighing 90kg (200lbs) with a six-metre (20ft) wingspan.

'I developed a special high-strength fibre material which has a tensile strength of 10 to 15 times that of steel,' he said.

'No matter what happens, the aircraft will not be damaged in a collision under any circumstances and that's the best way to protect human life.'

The plane can reach spectacular speeds of up to 120 miles (190 km) per hour, with one of his designs weighing just 90 kg (200 lbs) and with a six-metre (20 ft) wingspan. 'I developed a special high-strength fibre material which has a tensile strength of 10 to 15 times that of steel,' Bingyan said.

Zhang Bingyan graduated from Beijing Institute of Technology in the 1960s and was later assigned to the Chinese Commission of Science and Technology and Industry for National Defence to be engaged in engine research.

His latest design, which is the culmination of all of his work so far, is effectively an inflatable aircraft that because of its lightweight design, compared with a normal aircraft, has a big load capacity.

It also has good flexibility and, as with his earlier designs, high impact resistance.

He said it can be used for low speed and low altitude navigation, aerial surveys and remote sensing.
