A family who has fostered disabled children for three generations is facing homelessness after they signed up to a Government scheme to renovate their house so they could better care for their wards.

Mark and Clair Waite received a £75,000 grant from Leicestershire County Council to transform their home into a respite centre for severely disabled foster children two years ago.

But when the builder added a series of unforeseen costs to the bill the council withdrew its support leaving the couple to find the cash for themselves.

Unable to meet the builder's 
demands, he took them to court, leaving the Waites with a 
total bill of £59,000, a sum they can only afford by selling their home.

Despair: Mark and Clair Waite (pictured with children Joe, 10, and Charlie, 15) received a £75,000 grant from Leicestershire County Council to transform their home into a respite centre for severely disabled foster children two years ago

The couple, who represent the third generation in a 100-year family tradition of fostering disabled children, have had to sell all their furniture and clothes on ebay to pay solicitor's fees.

They say the council has 'left them out in the cold' over the legal wrangle, leaving them responsible for the debt - which will almost certainly result in them ending up on the streets with their two children, Joe, 10, and Charlie, 15.

'I think we've actually come to terms now with the fact that we are going to lose our house and be on the streets with nothing but we don't know how we've ended up in this mess,' said Clair, 39, from their home, which remains unfinished.

'All we've
ever wanted to do is help disabled children, it's something my family -
from my parents to my grandparents - have always done and now we can't 
even do that.'

Before: The Waites wanted to renovate their home in Coalville, Leicestershire, so they could better care for the three disabled children they already cared for

Unfinished: When the builder added a series of unforeseen costs to the bill the council withdrew its support leaving the couple to find the cash for themselves. With the family unable to pay, the builder left the home unfinished

Mark,
44,  who quit his job as a bricklayer in order to foster full-time, added: 
'I've been suicidal over all this. I've seriously considered driving my 
car into a tree as at times it has seemed like the only way out.'

The
Waites' problems began in 2010 when a social worker, admiring their 
good work in fostering children with profound and challenging 
disabilities, suggested they could be good candidates for a 
Government-funded scheme designed to create better respite facilities 
for disabled children.

The 
arrangement was that Clair and Mark, from Coalville, Leics., would 
provide five years of respite care for disabled children in the area in 
return for a £75,000 extension to their home.

Mark
said: 'Clair had always fostered children from the age of about 19 and 
her parents and her grandparents had always done it. I just liked it 
because I got on with the kids and used to mess about with them and have
fun.

History of care: The Waites come from a 100-year family tradition of fostering disabled children (Pictured: Clair's grandparents Elizabeth and Jack with Clair's mother Jackie, centre, and her aunt Jenny)

Happy children: Clair's grandmother, Elizabeth 
West, left, with a foster child. Clair's mother Jackie, also holding a 
foster child, right, followed in her mother's footsteps

Now they have been landed with a bill
for around £50,000, plus £9,000 in legal fees to the adjudicator. In 
June, they placed their home on the market for £250,000 in order to pay 
the bills but every day the fees are mounting.

'Foster children 
sometimes get treated like second class citizens, but the one thing 
we've always made sure to do is to treat our foster children exactly the
same as we treat our own children'.

'We 
exclusively fostered disabled children because that's what Clair's 
family had always done and we felt they were the ones that needed the 
most help.

'We had three foster children living 
with us when we were approached about the short breaks scheme. It seemed
like a great opportunity because it was a guaranteed job for five years
and it meant I could work from home. We just jumped at it.'

Under
the scheme, called Aiming High for Disabled Children (AHDC), the 
building work was to include the addition of two extra bedrooms, 
wheelchair access and a wet room with a hoist for lifting severely 
disabled youngsters.

Hole in the ground: The builder left the drainage unconnected and Mark had to finish much of the work himself

Aiming
High for Disabled Children launched in May 2007 and promised 
£430-million to local councils for transforming disabled children's 
services. AHDC is jointly delivered by the Department for Children, 
Schools and Families and the Department of Health.

However, 
after the Waites' project was agreed with Leicestershire County Council,
the builder requested some extra work, totalling about £18,000, be 
added to the bill.

These
extras were negotiated and agreed by the Aiming High project manager 
Owen London, but when the council failed to cough up the cash for the 
extras, the builder, Mark Lupton of Sandaland Properties Ltd., turned to
the Waites to stump up the money.

The
family then faced two adjudications, in which the county council funded
a barrister to represent them, racking up a legal bill of over 
£13,000.

But when Mr 
Lupton initiated a third adjudication, demanding payment for a final 
account of £47,000, the council withdrew all their legal support.

One way out? Mark, who quit his job as a bricklayer in order to foster full-time, said he has felt suicidal over the ordeal

The
second adjudication was won, but the first and third - for which the 
Waites had to shell out £12,000 of their own money - were lost.

Now they have been landed with a bill
for around £50,000, plus £9,000 in legal fees to the adjudicator. In 
June, they placed their home on the market for £250,000 in order to pay 
the bills but every day the fees are mounting.

The
family now face homelessness and bankruptcy and say the council is no 
longer prepared to offer them any useful solution. Their only hope is to
take the builder to court, at a cost of £10,000, with money borrowed 
from Clair's father, Pete.

Meanwhile
the work on their home has not even been completed meaning there is 
insufficient wheelchair access, no downstairs wetroom and no hoist. As a
result, the disabled children the scheme was designed to help are 
missing out on valuable respite care, say the Waites.

Mark
said: 'We have lost everything and now we feel we have nothing left to 
lose by speaking out. No one wants to listen to us anymore, the council 
won't even return our calls.

In love: Clair's grandparents, Elizabeth and Jack West

'It's been a horrible strain on the family. Clair and I have been arguing for the first time ever and our children have been so terrified that the bailiffs are going to come round that we have had to move out.

'We've not been able to do the job that we love and we've lost the three foster children we were caring for because the house is not ready for them to live in.'

Leicestershire County Council has publicly stated that 'the Waites are refusing to work with us to resolve the issue', however the most recent piece of correspondence, dated September 27, states the couple has 21 days to respond to an offer - 'a full and final settlement' of £5,000 towards their legal fees - on condition that they sign a confidentiality agreement and drop complaints of bullying they have registered with the council.

'All we've
ever wanted to do is help disabled children, it's something my family -
from my parents to my grandparents - have always done and now we can't 
even do that'

- Clair Waite

Mark said: 'The offer is a joke. It would barely cover half of what we need to take the builder to court and who is to say there won't be more problems and more litigation further down the line?'

Councillor Michael Wyatt has been supporting the family through their ordeal. He said: 'This family have been to hell and back, all because the county council are refusing to take responsibility for their actions.

'Even now, the family do not know if they are going to lose their home. I only hope this awful situation can be resolved as soon as possible.'

A Leicestershire County Council spokesman said: 'From the outset, it's important to stress that we strongly refute the allegations made by the Waites and provide a wealth of support to our foster carers.

'We have paid in full for the cost of the adaptation, topped up the funding considerably and given the couple money for legal advice.

'In essence, this is a dispute between the couple and their builders and we have given considerably more money to the family than would have been reasonably expected.

'Like any council, we have to manage public money lawfully and can't offer unlimited funding but we sympathise with the couple's situation and would strongly encourage them to accept our offer of help.'
