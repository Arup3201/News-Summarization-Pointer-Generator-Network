The Sun's chief foreign correspondent and a prison officer have been charged over alleged payments to public officials, police said today.

Journalist Nick Parker and prison officer Lee Brockhouse are accused of conspiring together to commit misconduct in public office between April 2007 and October 2009.

It is claimed that Brockhouse, who worked at Swaleside prison in Kent, received £1,750 from The Sun for information about prison life and inmates, and £900 from the People.

He is facing the conspiracy charge, and one count of misconduct in public office between February 2009 and June 2011.

Parker faces two other counts alleging that he conspired with an unnamed police officer to commit misconduct in public office - one charge between March 26 and April 3 2009 and the other between December 2 and 7 2009.

Gregor McGill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'We have concluded that Nick Parker, a journalist at the Sun newspaper, should be charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.

'We have also concluded that Lee Brockhouse, a prison officer at HMP Swaleside, should be charged with one count of misconduct in a public office and one count of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.

'It is alleged that on two occasions the Sun newspaper paid money to a public official in exchange for the unauthorised disclosure of information to Nick Parker relating to well-known individuals.

'It is also alleged that, between April 23 2007 and October 27 2009, the Sun newspaper paid £1,750 to prison officer Lee Brockhouse for the unauthorised disclosure of information to Nick Parker.

'Additionally, it is alleged that Lee Brockhouse provided similar information to the People newspaper, for which he was paid £900.

'It is alleged that information provided by Lee Brockhouse included that relating to the movement of prisoners, prison procedures and methods used by prisoners to smuggle items into prison.'

Prosecutors also decided that no further action will be taken against deputy news editor of the Sun John Sturgis after he came under investigation.

Parker and Brockhouse will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on July 18

In an internal message to News International staff, chief executive Mike Darcey said he was glad that Mr Sturgis could carry on work free from that burden.

He added that he was disappointed that Parker is being charged but that the journalist will be given legal support.

Parker and Brockhouse will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on July 18.
