Prince Andrew will finally step down from his position as a global trade ambassador, he confirmed last night.

The move follows a series of scandals, culminating with revelations about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

However, in a face-saving move, the prince will fashion himself the role of a jobbing royal with a particular interest in British business.

It means he will continue to clock up miles travelling abroad at taxpayers' expense.

Andrew has been dogged by controversy since he gave himself the rather grand title of UK Special Representative for International Trade and Investment in October 2001.

He has been repeatedly accused of ‘cashing in’ on connections with oil-rich trading partners, of developing questionable friendships with disreputable figures and of lavishing millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on private jets and helicopters.

In his annual review, published late last night, the prince put a brave face on his demotion, saying he had decided to ‘evolve’ his role to concentrate on promoting British skills and exports.

He wrote: ‘As the evolution of my role continues apace…I have decided that the label I gave myself when I began this role of Special Representative has served its purpose and is no longer necessary to the work that I do today and, more importantly, in the future.’

While admitting he would be focusing on the UK, he stressed his work would take him to the Middle East and Asia but said that all overseas engagements would be rubber stamped by the Royal Visits Committee at the palace and the Foreign Office.

The final nail in the coffin for Andrew’s envoy role was the revelation of his links with Epstein.

In February photographs were published of the pair walking together in New York, after the billionaire financier had been released from jail for grooming underage girls for sex.

Palace officials are known to remain jittery about the possibility of further revelations concerning his relationship with Epstein – including rumours that at least one of the women involved in the scandal may be writing a tell-all book.

Andrew himself was on a ‘boys-only’ holiday in Canada, canoeing in the isolated North West Territories. He is not due to return to the country until next week.

Downing Street sources confirmed they understood the prince was stepping down and made clear they had no interest in him taking on any other formal business-related role.

While they admit that Andrew has been useful in opening doors, particularly in former Soviet republics and the Middle East,  officials at UKTI were not queuing up to heap praise on him yesterday.

‘He is a very difficult man to deal with – rather pompous and one who simply refuses to listen to reason,’ said one official who asked to remain anonymous.

‘I think many people will be breathing a sigh of relief.’

But the suggestion that Andrew will sever his formal link with UKTI – which was first revealed by the Mail’s Richard Kay – will not curtail his activities.

One source suggested the prince wanted to become a more active advocate of London’s role as a global financial centre.

Labour MP Chris Bryant yesterday described Andrew’s departure as ‘long overdue’.

Mr Bryant, a former Foreign Office minister said that within the department the prince’s trips ‘were legendary – but not for the right reasons’.

He said the prince insisted on travelling ‘in style’ with an entourage of at least six, including a valet equipped with an ironing board.

Mr Bryant accused the prince of bringing Britain ‘into disrepute’ because of his dealings with a number of unsavoury characters.

David Cameron said the prince had made a ‘major contribution’ to UK trade over the last decade.
