Obama has attempted to pacify jittery gun-owners by talking about his love of clay pigeon shooting.

The President's words will be seen as an attempt to reassure conservative voters who are angry about his plans to ban assault weapons as part of a drastic overhaul of gun laws.

In a soon-to-be published interview with The New Republic, President Obama is asked whether he has ever fired a gun.

He said:  ‘Yes, 
in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.’

Shooter: Obama has spoken of enjoying clay pigeon shooting at Camp David as an angry debate over gun law changes goes on

He added: ‘Not the girls, but oftentimes guests 
of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of
hunting that trace back in this country for generations.

'And I think 
those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.’

The President's plans for tighter firearms regulations were drawn up by Vice President Joe Biden and include a ban on military-style assault weapons and a 10-shot limit on the magazines of weapons.

They are a response to the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, last month.

Tough sell: Obama faces strong opposition to his proposed new gun laws, despite which he says he has a 'profound respect' for the nation's history of hunting with firearms

However, President Obama told gun control advocates 
they need to do 'a little more listening' as he discussed his stance on 
assault weapons.

'Part of being able to move this 
forward,' President Obama says, 'is understanding the reality of guns in
 urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural 
areas.'

According
 to the Associated Press, the president says in the interview that he 
has a 'profound respect' for America's long tradition of hunting with 
firearms.

He pointed to this history as the reason many gun rights advocates are so protective of their constitutional right to bear arms.

The proposals to change gun laws have been made in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre

'If you grew up and your dad gave you a
 hunting rifle when you were ten,' the president said, 'and that became 
part of your family's traditions, you can see why you'd be pretty 
protective of that.'

Obama referred to the gap between 
urban and rural views on gun ownership as 'part of the biggest task over
 the next several months' in his fight for public support of his assault
 weapons ban.

'And that' he says, 'means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening 
than they do sometimes.'

Earlier
 this month, the president signed 23 executive actions aimed at 
tightening gun laws. These do not require congressional approval.

Gun
 rights advocates like those at the National Rifle Association, who say 
Obama's move to overhaul gun control will only affect honest, law-abiding gun
 owners.

Long battle: Obama's gun laws are unlikely to be passed through the Republican-dominated House and both sides say they are prepared for a drawn out battle

'Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,' the NRA said in a statement after Obama signed his order alongside Vice President Joe Biden and several children who wrote him letters asking for greater gun controls.

Obama has also asked congress to renew the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, restrict magazines to no more than 10 rounds, and expand background check requirements to cover gun conventions and private sales.

The interview will appear in the February 11 issue of The New Republic.
