We've had the Pope selfie, the Oscars selfie, the girls with no make-up selfie and even the boys with make-up selfie - but this one flies miles above the rest.

A Norwegian F-16 fighter pilot has taken one of the most ice-cool photos of all time - in the middle of a mock dogfight.

The airman was in the skies above Troms, Norway, taking part in a winter exercise which involved hundreds of jets when he turned his camera on his own face.

The image was released by the Norwegian Armed Forces and was one of several taken by pilots on the exercise.

It comes weeks after another fighter pilot in Denmark snapped himself while being photobombed by a missile he had just fired.

The spectacular picture captured the moment the sidewinder roared past him in the background, with its rocket burning brightly, as the Danish top gun flew an F-16 jet at hundreds of miles an hour.

The image has been released by the Royal Danish Air Force days after a picture being dubbed the most famous selfie in the world was taken at the Oscars.

It featured 11 of the biggest stars in Hollywood including Bradley Cooper, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Channing Tatum, Jennifer Lawrence, Jared Leto, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Julia Roberts and siblings Lupita and Peter Nyongâ€™o.

Selfies found worldwide fame when one was taken by Barack Obama, David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt during Nelson Mandela's memorial in December.

Pope Francis is a particular fan - allowing young worshippers to be pictured with him on their smartphones - and Princes Charles and William have also been snapped in photos with fans.
