An internal employee memo from McDonald's was leaked Monday, which says not to plug the fact that the fast food giant's extra value meal choices include a side salad.

The memo was obtained from an East Hanover, New Jersey restaurant and published by CNBC.

It says 'Do not suggest side salad as an option, customer should request it when they order.'

CNBC noted that the other extra value meal side choice is getting medium fries. 

Internal memo: The memo says McDonald's employees should not plug the fact that the fast food giant's extra value meal choices include a side salad

Lisa McComb, a representative for McDonald's, said to CNBC 'The chart is simply a quick reference guide that is part of a broader restaurant training tool to assist crew in efficiently taking customers' orders.'

She continued 'Customers are made aware of the choice of side via the menu boards so the intent of the signage is to remind crew it's not necessary to recite it as an option so they can focus on accurately and efficiently ringing up the order.'

McDonald's did not immediately respond to a Daily Mail Online request for comment. 

CNBC noted that clementines are now a side option for children's meals. The website reported that 'Outgoing CEO Don Thompson told investors in mid-2013 that salads have ranged from about 2 to 3 percent of sales since the chain introduced them.'

Further south, McDonald's subsidiary in Mexico is apologizing for a Facebook post that was seen as trashing tamales, Mexico's corn-dough treat.

A statement posted Tuesday on the McDonald's Mexico website said: 'It was never the intention of McDonald's Mexico to disrespect traditions or traditional Mexican foods like tamales.'

The original tamale post came on Monday's Candelaria day holiday, when tamales are traditionally eaten. Tamales are usually wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves.

The post said roughly, 'tamales are a thing of the past. The McBurrito also comes wrapped.'

McDonald's wrote 'we apologize to those who might have been offended by the publication, which has been withdrawn from our social media.' 

Note: After this story was originally published, McComb later told Daily Mail Online in an email exchange 'The reporting and headline on this have been very misleading and inaccurate. There was no internal memo. The initial reporting was based on one restaurant training component. Viewed alone, the chart was not in full context. The chart was simply a quick reference guide that is part of a broader restaurant training tool to assist crew in efficiently taking customers’ orders.

'Customers are made aware of the choice of their side options via the menu boards so the intent of the signage is to remind crew it’s not necessary to recite any option, rather allow the customer to select their own choice, so the crew can focus on accurately and efficiently ringing up the order.

'No particular side (e.g. fries nor side salad) would be suggested specifically; rather, the customer would be made aware of choices via menu board and would make the choice from that.'
