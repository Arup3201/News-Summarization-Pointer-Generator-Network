A Chilean man who allegedly attempted to rob an elderly man at knifepoint ended up at the pointy end himself after he was spotted mid-thievery and caught by the crowd.

The alleged thief, named locally as Valentino Abeyta Barrera, was caught by bystanders, disarmed, stripped naked and tied to a lamppost.

Crowds gathered round as 32-year-old Barrera had his clothes torn off and his underpants pulled down, before he was wrapped in clingfilm during the incident in the Chilean capital Santiago.

Police arrived after 20 minutes, but when they asked Barrera what was going on, he refused to answer, only begging police to free him.

After Barrera was released and taken to the police station he refused to file a complaint, and police said they had been forced to let him go because the alleged victim of the man's attack had also not made a complaint.

A police spokesman said: 'Unless the man who was tied to the lamppost or his alleged victim want to file a complaint, there is not much we can do.'

Photographs of the incident were posted online where they quickly went viral, and sparked heated debate over vigilante justice.

Many said that it made those giving the crook a beating as bad as the crook himself, while others said it showed the lack of faith in the police and the justice system.

Daniela Montoya Pazo said: 'They just had to arrest him, not beat him. 

'This kind of things put us at the same level as the criminals.'

But another, Daichi Yuka, said: 'I would like to do the same thing to the thief who threatened me with a weapon this morning.'
