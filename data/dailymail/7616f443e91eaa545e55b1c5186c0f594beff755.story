CLICK HERE to see Harry Redknapp's Premier League team from the early era.

For five decades, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful characters.

In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' – serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager picks his two all-time greatest Premier League teams from the early years to the present day.

From John Terry to Cristiano Ronaldo, the 67-year-old reveals his one to 11 titans of the modern era.

Steven Gerrard: Stop picking on him

A Roy of the Rovers character. It’s surprising to me how often people have used this tag as a criticism of Steven Gerrard and his all-action playing style. He wants to be everywhere...he deserts his position...he can’t play in the middle because he’ll leave a gap. What nonsense. Roy Race was a comic book hero and Steven Gerrard is a real-life one.

Paul Scholes: Little ginger nut was a star

Scholes was playing tiki-taka football when nobody in England knew what it was. He was another of those players, like Denis Law or Bobby Moore, who at 15 probably looked as if he wouldn’t make it. 

Too small, you would think - can’t run, dumpy little ginger nut - but then the ball would come to him and he would dazzle you. He was the best footballer in that Manchester United midfield, better than Ryan Giggs and Roy Keane.

The former England midfielder enjoyed a glittering career at Old Trafford winning 11 Premier League titles

Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing 

Wenger heralded a change in English football... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports

Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent 

Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV!

Luis Suarez: How I missed out on signing him at Tottenham

Despite all that has happened in his career since, one of the biggest regrets of my life in management is not taking Luis Suarez to Tottenham when we had the chance. 

‘You’ve got to take him, Harry,’ Ruud Gullit told me. ‘He’s fantastic.’ Yet all of our scouts’ reports said that at Ajax he played wide off a striker, whereas we were looking for a proper front man. 

Just when I was on the verge of taking the plunge, the price went up. In the end he was sold for £22.8million to Liverpool. We wouldn’t have paid that.

Rio Ferdinand: My Rolls-Royce

There is no way I can leave Rio Ferdinand out of this team because I tipped him at 16 to be the greatest centre-half in Europe and I think, for a time, that is exactly what he was. Nemanja Vidic was a tank, but Rio is the Rolls-Royce.
