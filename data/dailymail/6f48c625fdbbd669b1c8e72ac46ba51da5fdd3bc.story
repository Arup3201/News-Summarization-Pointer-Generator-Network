Last summer, Randy and Heidi Martin sold their house, bought an RV and took their daughter Kristi and son Kyle out of school to visit all 50 of the United States.

Randy and Heidi went on sabbatical last June from their jobs at The King's Academy school in West Palm Beach, Florida after spending nine months planning the trip.

For the past 13 months, the Martins have been touring the U.S. in their RV trailer, driving more than 50,000 miles in the continental U.S., in addition to flying to Hawaii and sailing to Alaska.

Kids Kristi, 14, and Kyle, 12, were enrolled in online 
courses at the school during their year off, completing their eighth and
sixth grade studies while getting to learn about American history first
hand.

'We got to learn a ton about politics,' Kyle told NBC's Today. 'Places I see in the textbooks. We got to cross the Mississippi, we got to actually go on battlefields George Washington walked.'

Mother Heidi viewed the trip as a year of retirement she and her husband could share with their children while they are still young.

'I don't want us to do it when we're 60, because I'd be sitting there the whole time saying, "Oh, wouldn't the kids have loved this?"' she said.

On the go: The Martins sold their home and belongings and turned a truck and RV into their new mobile home away from home

Countdown: The Martins tracked their progress, filling in each new state they visited on their RV's sticker map

The trip started off on June 10th in Delaware, and from there the family drove across the U.S. visiting sights like the White House, Niagara Falls, Mt. Rushmore, the Grand Canyon, and the Hollywood sign.

They flew to Hawaii and took a cruise to Alaska to complete their tour of the United States.

They visited each state's State Capitol, several presidential libraries and historic sites like The Alamo and Ground Zero

They soaked in culture at Elvis Presley's Graceland and the Smithsonian Museum. 

When it came to food, they got out of their comfort zones trying  polyglot soup in New Mexico and a runza sandwich in Nebraska.

Natural beauty: Kristi soaks in Niagara Falls. The family was also able to visit five of Canada's ten provinces during the trip

Creating memories: The kids took surfing lessons in Hawaii and caught lobster in Kennebunkport, Maine

Taste of America: Kyle trying a Runza sandwich in Nebraska. Unfortunately. only dad Randy liked the sandwich which everyone else found undercooked and soggy

Paradise: The Martins flew to Hawaii and took a cruise to Alaska to visit the two states outside the continental U.S.

The Martins kept friends and family updated on their adventure with daily posts on Facebook and their personal website.

The trip had many sponsors and Heidi estimates they spent about $264 a day.

In
addition to seeing all the important sites, the kids got to experience 
life all across the U.S. - from catching Lobster in Maine to learning 
how to surf in Hawaii.

Out of their comfort zone: The native Floridians try snow skiing for the first time in Nevada

Road trip complete: Alaska was the last stop on the trip for the Martins, and the two kids kissed the dock in Ketchikan to mark the occasion

The Floridian family experienced what a real winter is like, snow skiing for the first time in Nevada. 

Now back home, Randy Martin reflects on the impact the trip and it's varied experiences had on his family.

'I hope I've shown my kids if you have a big dream you can do it.'
