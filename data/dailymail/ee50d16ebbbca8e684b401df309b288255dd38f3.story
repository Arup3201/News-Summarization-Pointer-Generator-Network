Corporal Chris Lunt undertook years of intensive training to ready himself for war in Afghanistan but says nothing could prepare him for the Kabul traffic.

As one of a small team of Australian soldiers charged with transporting VIPs, military personnel and the occasional journalist across the city, Corporal Lunt has learnt the first rule of driving in Kabul is there are no rules.

'It is quite a thing to behold being out there and just seeing people walk across the streets and highways where you are travelling at 80-90 km/h,' the transport leader from Brisbane says. 'There are no road rules.'

Driver Tammy Grant, from Townsville, faces close calls every day.

'People step out in front of you. Cars pull out in front of you from the opposite side of the highway, cars start reversing down the highway in front of you,' Private Grant says.

As well as the constant chaos of third-world traffic is the daily threat of car bombs, insurgents on motorcycles attaching magnetic explosives to vehicles and other improvised explosive devices.

Private Grant and her colleagues drive a small fleet of 200 Series Toyota Land Cruisers which have been modified with armour plating and improved suspension. 

The Land Cruisers are preferred to the otherwise highly-regarded 15-tonne Bushmaster vehicles because they are less obviously military and can be more easily navigated through the city's crowded streets.

Constant road threat: Afghanistan's National Army soldiers stand guard at the site of a car bombing on the road to the presidential palace in Kabul.

Two Americans and one Polish soldier were killed on September 16 when an armoured Land Cruiser similar to that driven by the Australians was destroyed by a suicide car bomber who had driven around their vehicle and detonated an explosive device. 

That fatal explosion was captured by traffic cameras and Corporal Lunt has shown his team the footage to remind them of the dangers of their job.

'We can't be complacent,' he says. 'We are out there almost every day.'

Best job: Despite the daily dangers, these Australian soldiers love their job driving armoured SUVs through the chaotic streets of Kabul.

And despite all the risks, Corporal Lunt and his team love their work. 

'This is probably the best job you can have in MEAO (Middle East Area of Operations),' he says.
