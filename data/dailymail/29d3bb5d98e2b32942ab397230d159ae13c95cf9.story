Radamel Falcao’s miserable stint at Manchester United hit a new low on Tuesday night when he was dumped into the reserves by manager Louis van Gaal.

Falcao has not played a minute for United’s first team since being dragged off in the home win over Sunderland last month and was left on the bench as Van Gaal’s team were knocked out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday night.

Now the £250,000-a-week loan signing from Monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the Under 21s against Tottenham. He didn’t score and was taken off as it ended 1-1.

The Colombia striker’s demotion underlines Van Gaal’s concern over his fitness. The United manager usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury.

Falcao has been injury-free since recovering from a thigh strain in November and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level when he is desperate to prove he is worth a permanent deal.

Having scored only four times in six months, Falcao’s chances of being retained in the summer are almost nil. But he feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by Van Gaal.

Sportsmail reported earlier this year that the 29-year-old feels he has to work twice as hard to impress Van Gaal than other players.

Van Gaal rarely does that apart from for players coming back from injury
