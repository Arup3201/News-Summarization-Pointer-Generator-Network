We may have been married for 20 years but, until this week, I had never sent my wife a love letter, writes BRIAN VINER. Nor had she ever sent one to me. To be honest, they always seemed a bit, well, un-British.

And unbefitting to a couple in their early 50s, with three children, the oldest at university. But when I heard that Great Gatsby actress Carey Mulligan and her husband, the singer Marcus Mumford, exchange frequent love letters, it set me thinking.

If they do it, why can’t we? So, would our first ever love letters set our suburban household alight?

Still making each other laugh after 20 years: Brian and Jane Viner

My Darling Jane,

The great essayist Anais Nin once wrote that age does not protect you from love, but that ‘love, to some extent, protects you from age’. That is what I feel, with all my heart.

At 51, I suppose I am in the earlyish autumn of my years. At any rate, if I were a tree, I’d be shedding a few rust-coloured leaves. But I don’t mind. It will be fun to shed them together, and regain the independence we had before the children  were born. Weekends away at the drop of a hat. Do you remember all those hats we used to drop?

I wondered, when contemplating this letter, whether to quote Shakespeare, who was so good at expressions of love. But using other people’s lines, even Anais Nin’s, is a cop-out. Besides, everybody’s version of love is different. 

Inspiration: Actress Carey Mulligan and her musician husband Marcus Mumford exchange frequent love letters

Who honestly believes, as the actress Ali McGraw once put it, that love means never having to say you’re sorry? I’ve said a million sorries to you - and you, getting on for, what, 11 or 12 to me?

Did that make you laugh? I hope so, because for you and me, love and laughter are indivisible.

Ten years ago, when I wrote a book about our move from the city to the country, I dedicated it ‘To Jane, the wind beneath my wings, the compost beneath my beans’.

In some ways, that said it all. I wanted you to know what you meant to me, and what you have done for me, but I banged in a gag to pre-empt any accusations of soppiness.

In a way, I do wish I could reach for one of Shakespeare’s sonnets to tell you how much I love you.

And if I were to compare thee to a summer’s day, it would be that early-evening bit when I pour two glasses of chilled rosé and we sit at the garden table, watching the dogs chasing each other round the lawn. One of those moments of such profound happiness that they elicit not a smile, but a sigh.

On their wedding day: Brian proposed on a beach in Suffolk

I know that writing a public love letter to me will make you wince, since you don’t even believe in going out on Valentine’s Day. I can’t claim to be Prince Charming, either.

But I fancy you just as much as I did when I first sat at your desk in the newspaper office where you were deputy news editor and I was a novice reporter. Who’d have thought then that we’d end up making three children together?

More than two decades on, I’m still as beguiled by those amazing greeny-blue eyes as much as I ever was. More than anything else, though, I respect and admire you, for your interest in the world, for your wit, for your intelligence, for your incredible culinary skills, for your kindness to your friends, and above all, for your endless commitment, patience and resourcefulness as a mother.

I have to admit that when you were pregnant with Eleanor, our firstborn, I was worried. Part of what had so attracted me to you was your no-nonsense professionalism in the workplace, and I didn’t know what would replace that, when, if only temporarily, you gave up work. It was hopelessly naïve of me not to realise that, overnight, your skills as a mother would seem more important to both of us than your skills in your job.

But then, it is hopelessly naïve of any couple to embark on a life together expecting it to be  sun-kissed most of the way through. Yet, even in this peculiar age of pre-nuptial agreements, we all do it.

Well, I think our 20 years of  marriage have, indeed, been more sun-kissed than not. That particular naïve expectation came true. And even in times of drizzle, I have never wanted to share the umbrella with anyone but you.I love you. And thank you, for everything.

Yours husband, Brian xxx

Hi Darling,

Not usually romantic: Jane is unaccustomed to making declarations of love

Love letters. Hmm. Not sure what I 
think, since any written declaration of love sounds borrowed from some 
other, more lyrical writer, and anyway, I come from a long line of 
Yorkshire women - a species not known for their romanticism.

And you already know that I love you, 
because I sometimes defy my Yorkshire heritage and say so. Not so often 
that the words lose their meaning, but not so rarely that you could ever
forget.

But declarations of love, I think, mean 
more when they’re made at surprising moments, not when they’re flagged 
up by marketing men at Thorntons. This is why you and I give Valentine’s
Day a body swerve - although if it weren’t for me, you’d be more of a 
chocolates and flowers man yourself. You’re a natural romantic, and I’m 
really not.

I love you with all my heart, but I 
laughed when you proposed, on that deserted beach in Suffolk, in 1992. 
And worse, perhaps, than sniggering at the Big Question, was year after 
year forgetting our wedding anniversary.

We were married on January 7 (for a 
while I thought it was January 5) and I still maintain it’s a terrible 
day for an anniversary. First day back to school after Christmas more 
often than not; lunchboxes to prepare, plimsolls to find, children to 
corral. Harassed and harried, I would pass you at the front door, give 
you a cursory goodbye, and you would wait until then to say: ‘Happy 
anniversary, darling’.

It has been my very good fortune to have
married a man who laughs in the face of such casual neglect, enjoying 
the joke of a stereotype being turned on its head. This is because you 
have a dear, forgiving nature from which I (sharp-tongued sometimes and 
not always very fair) benefit, time and again.

Your love for me is sustaining and 
humbling, and although I appear to be taking it for granted, it 
underpins my life. I’m better at the anniversaries these days, because I
do think it’s important to honour and cherish a husband as loving and 
gracious as you are.

And you’re the funniest person I know; 
even your Les Dawson moments make me laugh, and after the joke, your 
laughter makes me laugh: that shoulder-heaving, almost silent laughter 
that usually ends with you getting wheezy.

Still happy together: The couple have raised three children

When you look back over our two decades of marriage, does it make you smile to think of all the times we have laughed?

Twenty years, Brian! I’m sure we felt 
like adults when we married, but we’ve grown up together. We’ve had 
children, moved house, navigated stormy waters. I’ve always depended on 
you, and always known I  could. You are my safe harbour.

I worry, you reassure. So often you’ve 
said to me: ‘If you want to know our future, look at our past,’ and 
although none of us really knows what lies ahead, I can almost believe 
that you do.

So, what this unromantic Barnsley lass 
would like to say is, Thank you for remaining, through thick and thin, 
my lovely, lovely husband: handsome, generous, courteous, and full of 
love for me and for the children (who thanks to you can all throw and 
catch a ball, have almost perfect table manners, love a good sunset and 
never forget to clean their teeth.)

The wonderful, mysterious alchemy 
between us that produced our offspring is a source of daily joy, and as 
good a testament to our love as any I could wish for.

They’re nearly grown now, and before too
long it’ll be you and me again, so, this is the plan. We’ll hire a 
classic car — a two-seater, and you can choose — and take a lengthy, 
leisurely drive through France, staying in auberges and eating in those 
restaurants that we read about and never visit.

It’ll be a second honeymoon for my funny valentine and me.

Touched: Brian is glad they put pen to paper

Despite our misgivings and fears, our love letters have touched us both. What we said was truly heartfelt.

Moreover, there was the added dimension of distance between us when we wrote them, for I was in the Caribbean, on a writing assignment, and Jane was at home in north Herefordshire.

The next challenge will be to exchange love letters when I am upstairs at my computer, and she is downstairs at hers. But I really think we might.
