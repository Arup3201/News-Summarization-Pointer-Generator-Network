The parents of a baby girl who suffers from a rare condition that caused her head to swell to nearly double its size have pleaded for more money to fund her treatment.

Roona Begum, aged 18 months, suffers from hydrocephalus, a build up of fluid inside the skull.

Surgeons at the private hospital run by 
the Fortis Healthcare group, offered to treat Roona for free after 
pictures emerged of her living with the condition in a village in rural 
state of Tripura.

Appeal: The parents of a baby girl who suffers from a rare condition that caused her head to swell to nearly double its size have pleaded for more money to fund her treatment

She underwent surgery last month, but her parents - whose daily income is just £2 a day - are struggling to foot the shortfall left by a string of complex procedures.

So far the treatment needed to save the toddler  is estimated to have cost between £33,000 and £36,000 - around 30 times initial predictions which placed the cost at just £1,120.

Currently Fatima and Abdul Begum are between £11,000 and £13,000 short - with aftercare costs set to send the bill spiralling.

Life-saving: Since being admitted the toddler's head has been reduced through a series of life-saving surgeries

Global donations through MyGoodAct's website www.roonabegum.org have topped £23,000, leaving Roona's desperate parents fearful for her future if they don't receive more financial help.

Her mother Fatima, 24, who lives with husband Abdul, 26, said: 'To all those who have helped Roona, thank you.

'She is already showing signs of happiness, and we can finally smile again.

'But she needs more surgery to make her look right and we need to care for her future. We have no way of paying.'

Roona faces months of reconstructive surgery to mould her disfigured skull back into shape.

And she could still be left brain damaged or blind because of the swelling - which will increase the mammoth medical bill.

Illiterate bricklayer Abdul added: 'With just one person working it is not possible to sustain the family and a child who needs treatment. My earnings are too low.

Success: Doctors said the procedure went 'perfectly' and that the results were 'better than expected'

Chances: Doctors have already said that the youngster is lucky to be alive, with most sufferers of the condition not surviving beyond a year old

'But we are very happy with the response we have got from people around the world and are hoping for the same in the future.'

Doctors have already said that the 
youngster is lucky to be alive, with most sufferers of the condition not
surviving beyond a year old.

Director of neurosurgery Dr. Sandeep 
Vaishya, who has personally cared for Roona recently carried out the 
first of many costly Cranial Vault Remodelling operations to reconstruct
her disfigured skull.

Despite experts declaring Roona's 
tender life is no longer at risk, Dr. Vaishya admits there are still 
challenges ahead. He said: 'We did not expect Roona to survive this 
long. We had a lot of worries initially.

'The treatment has gone much better than initially expected.

'The head size has reduced by about 
30cm (12ins) and has come down to around 54cm (21ins). We aim to reduce 
this by another 10cm (4ins).

'Her case has been very challenging 
as we don't have any precedent to fall back on and nobody to guide you 
at any step. We have kept on reinventing ourselves everyday according to
the situation.

'Now we really don't expect much danger as her wounds are healing and she has also started eating orally.

Roona's improved condition has also 
led her estranged grandparents, who initially rejected the 'abnormal' 
child, to check up on her health - delighting both parents.

Abdul said: 'Since the medical treatment started we have received a few calls from my parents and they do inquire about Roona.

Before: Abdul Rahman holds his 18-month-old daughter in front of their home before her operation

'This makes me happy as earlier they 
refused to accept her as their granddaughter because of her head size - 
but thanks to every one who helped us Roona is going to have her 
grandparents.

'There is a lot of difference in her head size than before and we are very happy about it.

'The doctors and everyone here at the
hospital have done their best to help us and I hope everything ends 
soon so that we can have our daughter back.'

Fatima added: 'Roona is responding to the treatment and there are changes in her behaviour as earlier she was playing with us.

'I get afraid and feel sad when I look at the scars that are there after the surgery.

'I know it's for her own good but as a mother it's difficult for me to see this little girl going through all these operations.

'We are looking forward to taking Roona back home so she can start her life as a normal child.'
