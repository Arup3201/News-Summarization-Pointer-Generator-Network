Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots star awaiting trial for murder, has revealed that he is enjoying a stress-free existence inside the Bristol County House of Corrections, Massachusetts.

Hernandez is awaiting trial in the slaying of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd, an acquaintance whose body was found a mile from Hernandez’s home in June.

‘I’m way less stressed in jail than when I was out of jail,’ wrote Hernandez in the two-page letter which is dated November 17. ‘I’m just anxious to go to trial to see what’s up and prove my innocence.’

Hernandez, 24, pleaded not guilty to 
first-degree murder and five-related weapons charges in September. He is
being held without bail.

Despite
a note pleading with the recipient - an old friend - to keep his 
correspondence private, the note has found its way into the hands of TMZ.

In
the letter Hernandez tells his so-called friend that his corrections 
officer ‘hasn’t seen me in a bad mood yet and I really enjoy my days. 
It’s not that bad, honestly.

‘I’m just hoping I am out within these next few years, to get a chance to ball again.’

Hernandez also wrote that he’s 
spending his time reading - he claims to have read 25 books since he’s 
being incarcerated - and is 'using this time to become strong, wiser and 
trying to come out, when I come home, way more intelligent, which I 
will.'

Hernandez also admits to some regrets. including that he 'could have made better choices with my 
selected few (friends) but it’s life, you live and learn!'

The
ex-Patriots star even includes a drawing, the outline of a nude woman 
besides which he wrote ‘Dats a bad b****!!!’ together with a smiley face.

Hernandez
remains housed in the prison's special management area where 
socializing isn’t allowed.

Prisoners in the area are not allowed to 
have direct contact with each other and only get outside for three hours a
day.

Four others, including Hernandez's girlfriend and cousin, face charges in the case.

Lloyd,
a semi-professional player, was found dead less than a mile from his 
home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts on June 17.

Hernandez
is also being investigated by a grand jury over the deaths of Danny 
Abreu and Safiro Furtado in July 2012, soon after they left a nightclub 
in Boston.
