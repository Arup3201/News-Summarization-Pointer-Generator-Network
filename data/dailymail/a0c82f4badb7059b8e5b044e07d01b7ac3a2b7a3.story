Two of these were forced to undergo life-saving surgery at Ohana Vet Hospital, according to the centre's Facebook page.

Police are now investigating the horrific incident, but no arrests have yet been made.

Santa Paula Animal Control were initially called to the house in Ventura County following reports that 'a number of dogs' were screaming and barking in the backyard, according to NBC4.

They discovered some of the animals fighting each other, while others were lying in cages or bleeding heavily on the floor.

Animal controllers managed to separate the dogs - including pit bulls, English bulldogs and Boston terriers - before calling the police.

Officers later said they had found evidence of
 the animals being trained to fight, including an agitator stick and the 
animals' cropped ears and clipped tails.

Meanwhile, evidence of dog breeding is also believed to have been discovered on the property.

The dogs' owner, who was not at home at the time, denied any allegations of wrongdoing, according to police.

Instead, he said he had 'tried to do something nice' by rescuing the dogs off the streets - adding: 'I want them to be around kids and family.'

Today, the rescue centre said two puppies, Luther and Lonnie, had been 'caked in dried blood and faeces' following the vicious fight.

But now, the animals have been washed, comforted and given medical treatment.

Meanwhile, a dog called Leon who suffered 'multiple oral injuries' and 'a separated jaw' in the conflict is expected to make a full recovery.

Owners in Santa Paula are allowed three dogs per household - and are required to be financially responsible for their pets' housing and medical expenses.

The Santa Paula Animal Rescue Center is collecting donations for the injured dogs via its website: sparcsaveslives.org.
