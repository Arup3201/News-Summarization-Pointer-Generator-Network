On the concourse overlooking Wembley Way, a six-metre high bronze statue of Bobby Moore proudly watched over the 80,000 England supporters who filed into the national football stadium on Saturday.

When the arena was officially opened in March 2007, the FA promised us that this magnificent structure was, first and foremost, to be used for football. We believed them.

On Saturday, as fans made their way past our only World Cup-winning captain, the ugly truth was confirmed when the lighting rigs were wheeled off the Wembley pitch.

The pitch quickly disintegrated under foot during England's Euro 2016 qualifying clash at Wembley

The departing circus, in this case the NFL, had left their calling card on a playing surface once deemed sacrosanct.

For a few million bucks, you can trample all over Wembley Stadium and, yes, sod the consequences. What a pity for Roy Hodgson.

Joe Hart was among the first out, heading over to one half of the pitch to read the words ‘NFL International Series’ stretching, almost, from the byline to the halfway line.

Behind each goal the emblems of the Dallas Cowboys and Jacksonville Jaguars, the two NFL teams who threw each other around in the mud last weekend, remained.

When the FA send Wayne Rooney the pictures of him receiving his golden cap in a glass cabinet from Sir Bobby Charlton, the England centurion will notice the NFL regulation 10-yard lines painted on the playing surface.

So what happens to the Wembley pitch now?

After next Sunday’s women’s match between England and Germany, the surface will be ‘rested’ (receive some serious TLC) until the Capital One Cup final on March 1.

Will the pitch take any more poundings before crucial Euro 2016 qualifiers?

That would be a big, loud yes. Two rugby union World Cup fixtures (New Zealand v Argentina and Ireland v Romania) and an NFL match are scheduled in the three weeks leading up to the final home qualifier, against Estonia on October 9. The NFL clash between Miami Dolphins and New York Jets is on October 4. Wembley bean-counters would point to the fact that gridiron games sell out instantly, while England football takes a bit longer.

How about switching international fixtures away from Wembley?

Sorry, no can do. The FA agreed a 10-year deal to use the stadium and that does not run out until 2017. Tickets for 10 years were sold on the back of the agreement so Roy Hodgson’s team will have to lump it for a little longer.

They were not for the ‘five-yard furies’, as Roy Hodgson has taken to calling his energetic young players, to press the Slovenians in this Euro 2016 qualifier.

A week was never going to be enough time for Wembley’s ground staff to scrub off the paint and there isn’t a lighting rig in the world that can promote grass growth at warp speed.

These images, from a venue that is still regarded as the home of football by many visiting players, were beamed around the world on Saturday afternoon. How embarrassing.

This is a world-class sporting facility and, if the FA are to put on events with 82,305 congregating at a stadium predominantly built for football, then the team and head coach deserve an elite playing surface.

The excuse that the wrong topsoil had been used is complete bunkum. What it has come down to, as Hodgson reluctantly accepted on Saturday evening after his team had beaten Slovenia 3-1, is money.

‘You can’t expect me, as a football coach, to make claims that Wembley should be used for NFL, rugby etcetera,’ he admitted. ‘On the other hand I am pragmatic enough to realise this is a factor in Wembley life . . . the FA have financial decisions, but as a football person I have to be in the camp that says I would like to see this place lying fallow virtually all the year, apart from seven or eight occasions.’

Roy Hodgson will be disappointed with the FA's decision to host rugby and NFL matches at Wembley

It will already be on Hodgson’s radar that next year the pitch will be churned up when two rugby World Cup group games take place on September 20 and 27.

On October 4, the NFL circus comes to town again when Miami Dolphins face New York Jets.

The football team, assuming they haven’t been forgotten about by then, play Estonia in a Euro 2016 qualifier at the stadium five days later. Hodgson will be hopping mad.

What we have now is a cash cow, a useful vehicle for the FA as they chase the dough before those expensive debentures run out in a few years’ time.

Until then the England team, fighting to restore their reputation after a dreadful showing at the World Cup in Brazil, will have to make do.

‘I can only say that I work for the FA,’ added Hodgson. ‘They make the decisions they have to make.’

In this case, they have sacrificed the national sport.
