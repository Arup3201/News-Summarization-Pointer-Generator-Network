It’s enough to make a grown England fan cry – despite having four teams in the Champions League only 17 of the players in football’s biggest club competition are eligible for Roy Hodgson’s national team.

In figures published on Thursday in Diario AS in Spain, England languish in 12th place in a league table drawn up on the basis of number of players each country has in the tournament.

Spain top the table boosted by the fact that Athletic Bilbao’s Basque-only policy gives them 22 Spanish players in their squad. In total Vicente del Bosque has 82 Spaniards to watch in the Champions League.

NUMBER OF PLAYERS EACH COUNTRY HAS IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 

1. Spain - 82

2. Brazil - 76

3. Germany - 56

4. France - 44

5. Portugal - 36

6. Italy - 34

7. Argentina - 24

8=. Turkey - 22

8=. Holland - 22

8=. Russia - 22

11. Sweden - 19

12. England - 17

13. Belarus - 16 

14=. Belgium - 15

14=. Greece - 15

16. Switzerland - 14

17=. Ukraine - 13

17=. Serbia - 13

19. Croatia - 11

20=. Cyprus - 10

20=. Ivory Coast - 10

22. Uruguay - 9

23. Colombia - 8

24=. Nigeria - 4

24=. Cameroon - 4

24=. Ghana - 4

There are 76 Brazilians in the competition and World Champions Germany have 56 players. With just 17 representatives England trail Sweden, Russia and Turkey as well as World Cup finalists Argentina, Italy, France and Holland.

As Hodgson desperately searches for leaders in his new England the lack of homegrown participation in the competition that kicked off again this week is an ongoing handicap for the national coach.

On Wednesday night Chelsea started with two Englishmen and Manchester City fielded only keeper Joe Hart from the kick-off. In contrast tabe-toppers Spain had 10 starters in the Bilbao side and six in the Barcelona XI. Spanish numbers are also boosted by their 29 exports playing around Europe.

Just two of Chelsea's starting line-up against Schalke were English: Gary Cahill (top, 2nd left) and John Terry (top, 2nd right)
