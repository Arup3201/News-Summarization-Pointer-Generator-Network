Each year, thousands of tourists flock to the Cotswold's village of Bibury to photograph the picturesque cottages on Arlington Row.

But many have been left disappointed with their pictures, complaining their carefully-framed shots are being photobombed - by a bright yellow car parked on the road.

Now a row has erupted between the disgruntled visitors and the residents of the Gloucestershire village, who have leapt to the defence of the car's owner - 82-year-old Peter Maddox.

The 14th-century cottages, the oldest inhabited properties in the UK, are featured on the inside cover of the British passport and have become the nation's most photographed 'ordinary' homes. 

Retired dentist Mr Maddox, who uses the car to do his grocery shopping in a nearby village, said his lack of garage leaves him with no choice but to park on the street.

But visitors have taken to Twitter to express their frustration at the parking spot, saying his Vauxhall Corsa is 'ruining' the view of the nearby homes, which are owned by the National Trust.

Photographer Lee McCallum, who runs a local tour company, sparked a debate when he called the car 'Bibury's elephant in the room'.

He tweeted a photo of the scene accompanied by a caption that read: 'Bibury's elephant in the room. The picture postcard street photobombed by the ugly little yellow car - every day.'

Mr McCallum does not object to the car being parked there and claims it reflects the 'weirdness of the Cotswolds'. 

Holiday snaps: Photographers have complained Mr Maddox's vehicle is ruining idyllic shots of the picturesque village. One ranted in a Twitter post that it 'gets in the way', adding he had 'cursed the yellow car'

But the 40-year-old added: 'Who owns the car? Why is he parking there? Does he know that his car is appearing in so many photos that are appearing all over the world? 

'I know the National Trust isn't entirely happy about it, but they can't do anything about it.'

Semi-professional photographer Robin Lawrence, of nearby Bourton-on-the-Water, said: 'That flipping yellow car! 

'You have an area of outstanding beauty and as a photographer, you are hampered by the car.'

Mr Lawrence, 53, added : 'It gets in the way of photographs. I have cursed the yellow car today.'

Mike Fletcher, a journalist and photographer from the village, said: 'Arlington Row is the most photographed cluster of English cottages in the world so the owner of the bright yellow car either hasn't registered that it's probably causing a lot of extra work on photoshop to take it out, or simply doesn't care.

Camera ready: Mr Maddox said he uses the car to do his grocery shopping in a nearby village. Above, a group of visitors carefully position themselves to make sure his car is not in their photo

'I hope it's the former as it makes me laugh each time I see it to think that someone could be that oblivious to how it doesn't fit the surroundings.'

Another Twitter user named Mike posted: 'I live in Bibury. Car is always photobombing tourist pics.'

Tourist Wendy Harris, 59, claimed the yellow car spoiled the picture she took of the spot during a visit in 2013.

The supermarket worker from Gloucester, said: 'I didn't get the perfect picture because the car was there, unfortunately.

'I took photographs from other angles without it, but then you can't get all the cottages in. Legally, he isn't doing anything wrong but aesthetically, he certainly is.

Residents said they expect more respect from tourists visiting the village, and said Mr Maddox had the right to park his car, pictured far right, on Arlington Row

'I'd tell the owner "Get a different coloured car! Anything but yellow!" Speaking as somebody who did once own a yellow car, I wouldn't have parked it in such a place.'

Slovakian architect Beata Cachovanova, 31, travelled to Bibury to see the world-renowned Arlington Row, but was left disappointed.

She said: 'It was there and I could not move it. I come across this problem a lot - something spoiling the perfect picture.'

Mr Maddox, who has lived in a cottage above Arlington Row for the last 12 years, said he has to park his car there as he has no garage.

He said: '[Visitors] can come and talk to me. I would just tell them there is no where else for me to put it.'

Mr Maddox bought the yellow Corsa a year-and-a-half ago and uses it to do his shopping in the nearby town of Cirencester, Gloucester.

He added: 'She's a lovely car. I saw it and went "Ahh". I love it here. It's very nice. The tourists don't bother me - I don't hear them.'

Residents of Arlington Row described the twitter spat as a 'storm in a teacup' and leapt to Mr Maddox's defence.

Francome Robinson has lived in one of the National Trust cottages for the past 23 years.

The 71-year-old said: 'Tourists should get a life. They must realise that we live here. These are our homes. Mr Maddox has every right to park there and there isn't anywhere else he can park.

'There are plenty of places people can take photographs from without getting the yellow car in.'

Resident Terence French, 62, who works in security, said: 'The residents are annoyed that this has been brought up. It's unbelievable.

'We put up with a lot from tourists here. This is absolutely ridiculous. There are more important things in life.'

Locals also claim they expect more respect from the tourists that visit Bibury.

Christine Charlton said that tourists open her door if it is unlocked and peer in the cottage windows.

She said: 'This is not Disney World. There's nowhere else to park and Peter is quite elderly. I think it is totally ridiculous.'

The National Trust said that they had no influence over where Peter parked his car as he is not an Arlington Row tenant.

Spokesman Allan King said: 'He is, we believe, parking on the highway which he is entitled to do. Because he is not our tenant or parking on our land, we wouldn't comment on the car.

'We look after the appearance of Arlington Row and try not to have modern intrusions.'

Arlington Row, pictured, began life as a monastic wool store but was converted into a row of weavers' cottages in the 17th century. Mr Maddox's car can be seen far right beneath the trees

Although the National Trust paints the houses on the famous street in colours based on historical evidence, they have no power as to what colour cars residents are allowed.

Residents have a car park at the rear of the row that does not obstruct the view of the cottages.
