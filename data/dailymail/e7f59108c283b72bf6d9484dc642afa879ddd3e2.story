One of the biggest concerns about smart household gadgets is how much data they collect and share about you and your home. 

And, with this in mind, a US government consumer watchdog has laid out guidelines that call for increased privacy and security across connected devices, for fitness, smart homes and other uses.

At the moment, the guidelines are only suggestions and 'best practices' that companies are encouraged to follow, but the agency did call on Congress to consider legislation to cover such data security.

The guidelines were announced by Federal Trade Commission chairwoman Edith Ramirez at the State of the Net conference in Washington (pictured). These guidelines call for increased privacy and security across connected devices, but are currently only suggestions and 'best practices' firms are encouraged to follow

The guidelines were announced by Federal Trade Commission chairwoman Edith Ramirez at the State of the Net conference in Washington.  

'Not only is deeply personal information at stake but as you have more and more devices it means there is more potential for exposure,' she told attendees. 

'If you want these new technologies to flourish, you want to make sure consumers understand what is happening, understand what is being collected, with whom that information is being shared, how this information is being used.'

Although the term ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) first appeared in 2005, there is still no widely accepted definition.

IoT includes gadgets bought by consumers, as well as products and services designed for businesses to help machines ‘communicate’ with each other.

For example, the term IoT can include the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags businesses place on products in stores to track their inventory, or sensors that monitor electricity use in hotels.

For the purposes of the report, the FTC uses the term IoT to refer to devices or sensors - other than computers, smartphones, or tablets - that connect, communicate or transmit information over the web.

It is limited to the gadgets sold to, or used by, consumers. 

As part of the report, the FTC recommends a number of actions. 

These include building security into devices at the outset, training employees about the importance of security, adding measures to stop unauthorised people accessing the device or network, and monitoring connected devices and providing security updates as soon as risks are identified. 

Last year, the FTC studied 12 mobile fitness apps and found they shared data with 76 separate entities.

Ms Ramirez continued: 'If I'm wearing a fitness band that tracks how many calories I consume I wouldn't want to share that data with an insurance company.'

The FTC report made no specific legislative recommendation for IoT but said 'there appeared to be widespread agreement that companies developing IoT products should implement reasonable security.'

The report added: ‘The Commission recognises this industry is in its relatively early stages [and] does not believe that the privacy and security risks, though real, need to be addressed through IoT-specific legislation at this time.

‘However, while IoT specific-legislation is not needed, Congress should enact general data security legislation.’

This interactive image shows how Internet of Things devices  can be used in a 'connected' living room - and other rooms in a smart house. These gadgets are connected using AllJoyn, set up by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2011. The software can be added to smart devices to make them ‘talk’ to other devices running AllJoyn

The guidelines would apply to the billions of devices that connect to the internet including cars, fridges, toothbrushes, fitness trackers, locks, security systems, and more.

But TechFreedom president Berin Szoka said :'At best, this is just another exercise in workshop theatre; at worst, the FTC is trying to regulate the Internet of Things by stealth.'

The report concluded: 'The IoT presents numerous benefits to consumers, and has the potential to change the ways that consumers interact with technology in fundamental ways.

'In the future, the Internet of Things is likely to meld the virtual and physical worlds together in ways that are currently difficult to comprehend. 

To mark Data Privacy Day, a study from internet and mobile security company BullGuard found that 41% of people post content about others online

Today is Data Privacy Day - an international effort focusing on: 'Respecting Privacy, Safeguarding Data and Enabling Trust.'

It is dedicated to helping people better understand how to protect personal information online. 

Commenting on the campaign, Richard Anstey, chief technical officer for EMEA at Intralinks told MailOnline: 'When dealing with very sensitive information, people need to know about very secure measures, such as information rights management. 

'Security is about knowing what the danger is and how to deploy the appropriate level of protection.

'If we want a truly data-secure society we need to start by ensuring people know what value their data has, then they can make informed decision about how to secure it.'

Jason Hart, vice president of cloud services, identity and data Protection at data security firm Gemalto added: 'Mobile devices are becoming a popular target for hackers. 

'This is hardly a surprise given so many of us have between one and three of them, and they are increasingly used to store sensitive work files and personal information.

'The challenge with these devices is that because they connect to the cloud, data ends up being stored in multiple places and this gives the hackers multiple attack points to use. 

'Therefore, unless security controls are in place and companies understand the location of where the data is being stored, there is a greater risk that these devices or their data could be breached.' 

A BullGuard survey has revealed that 'an alarmingly high number' of people don't give much consideration to what they post online.

For example, while 64 per cent of respondents said they give thought to their online reputation 36 per cent said they didn’t. 

A further 77 per cent said they also consider what they post might affect other people, but 23 per cent said it 'barely entered their minds'.

More than 40 per cent said they post content about other people, while 59 per cent said they never do.  

'From a security and privacy perspective, the predicted pervasive introduction of sensors and devices into currently intimate spaces - such as the home, the car, and with wearables and ingestibles, even the body - poses particular challenges.'

It added the Commission will continue to 'enforce laws, educate consumers and businesses, and engage with consumer advocates, industry, academics, and other stakeholders' to promote appropriate security and privacy protections. 

There are also industry-led bodies that are already working on securing and standardising the IoT protocols. 

There are also industry-led bodies that are already working on securing and standardising the IoT protocols for smart gadgets (illustrated in this graphic). For example, the AllSeen Alliance has developed 'a secure, persistent connectivity protocol' between Wi-Fi routers and cloud providers

IoT gadgets include the the August smart lock (pictured left). Fitted to the existing door lock, the battery-powered device is controlled by the August app. To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app (pictured right)

For example, at this year's CES, the AllSeen Alliance announced it had developed 'a secure, persistent connectivity protocol' between Wi-Fi routers and cloud providers.

Alliance members include Qualcomm, Microsoft, and Cisco, among others. 

This protocol is a step towards managing the security and privacy of all smart gadgets that are used in the car and home, and the work is based on an existing open source protocol called AllJoyn.

AllJoyn was set up by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2011.

It is software that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘talk’ to other devices running AllJoyn.

The company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further.

Another device is a smart security alarm called Canary (pictured). It can be connected to smart lights from LiFx. The lights could then flash in the bedroom, to silently alert homeowners to an intruder downstairs

Such IoT gadgets include the the August smart lock. Fitted to an existing door lock, the battery-powered device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the August app.

To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app. 

The lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired Bluetooth device. It then confirms the visitor's identity. 

Using AllJoyn, this lock can also be connected to a smart smoke or security alarm, such as Nest. When the alarm detects smoke, it triggers an event that is picked up by the lock. 

The lock then automatically opens to let people leave the house in a fire quickly. 

Another device is a smart security alarm called Canary. 

It can be connected to smart lights from LiFx. The lights could then flash in the bedroom, for example, to silently alert homeowners to the fact there is an intruder downstairs.
