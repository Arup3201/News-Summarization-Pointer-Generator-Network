A British teenager has miraculously survived after plunging 1,640ft off a mountain while posing for a selfie.

The unnamed 14-year-old was on a school trip in the Austrian resort of Molltaler Gletscher when he tumbled from the 10,242ft peak, landing just a few feet away from deadly rocks.

The boy, from Leeds, slipped over the icy edge, before sliding nearly a third of a mile down the slope. He came to a stop as he hit a ledge below.

A mountain rescuer said: 'A ledge stopped his fall. If it hadn't been there this would have ended tragically.'

The teenager was with five friends and a ski instructor at the top of Mount Scharek when the incident took place.

At the time, he had stepped backwards to take a photo of himself against the scenery. The ski instructor raced down to get him. 

Despite the dramatic fall, the schoolboy escaped with just bumps and bruises on his legs and upper body. He was airlifted to hospital in Schwarzach where he is still being kept under observation and is also said to be suffering from shock.

The rescuer added: 'We got a call from the ski-instructor who said one of the boys had fallen off the mountain.

'As it was, he was conscious and in shock but miraculously hadn't broken any bones or anything else.'  

A hospital spokesman said: 'He was given a check up and despite a few cuts and bruises he was absolutely fine. It's a miracle really.

'He is being kept in for observations and he should be out soon. And I imagine he has got quite an interesting selfie to show off.'

A spokesman for mountain rescue said: 'We strongly urge all visitors to the area to keep away from the mountain edge.'
