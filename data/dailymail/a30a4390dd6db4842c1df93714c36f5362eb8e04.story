Increasing numbers of top-of-the-range vehicles are being stolen every day by thieves who simply drive off after bypassing security devices by hacking onboard computers.

Gangs using ‘keyless’ techniques are estimated to have stolen more than 6,000 vehicles in London alone last year – almost half of all cars and vans stolen.

Most of the vehicles are broken down within hours before being loaded on to containers and shipped to Eastern Europe and Africa. 

Top-of-the-range BMWs and Range Rovers, as well as Ford Fiestas, Transit and Mercedes Sprinter vans, make up 70 per cent of all vehicles stolen in this way. 

Four-wheel-drive vehicles such as Range Rovers are among the most commonly targeted because they can be used in countries with poor roads.

One technique involves breaking into the vehicle and plugging a laptop into the hidden diagnostic socket used by garages to detect and solve faults.

Once connected the thieves can access the vehicle’s electronic information, allowing them to drive it away.

In some cases criminals have intercepted the remote ‘lock’ signal as the owner walks away, allowing them easy access to the vehicle. 

The theft can sometimes take as little as ten seconds, with some vehicles then fetching £10,000 on the black market. 

The trend threatens to destroy years of falling car crime figures as manufacturers create more secure vehicles.

In London, police chiefs are so concerned at the surge that they have launched a week-long crackdown to try and catch those responsible red-handed.

Investigators have discovered the vehicles are driven to remote locations in the Home Counties where they are stripped down.

They are then loaded into shipping containers and exported to clients in Africa, Cyprus, Eastern Europe, the U.S. and even Malaysia and Burma.

Some of the car theft rings are so sophisticated they can steal a car and get it out of the country in less than an hour.

Most of the thefts take place between 10pm and 4am between Sundays and Thursdays, when the owner is least likely to return to the vehicle.

Detective Chief Superintendent Carl Bussey, from the Met Police, said car owners must wise up to the risk of their brand new car being stolen.

He said: ‘We believe that organised crime groups using this technique are responsible for the theft of thousands of vehicles in London.

‘Many of those that we have already arrested in connection with keyless vehicle theft have previous links to other types of serious crime.

‘These people currently view keyless vehicle theft as a low-risk, high-return crime, with the most valued motor engines fetching anything up to £1,000 when sold on the black market, and entire vehicles making up to £10,000.’

Last year 90,000 vehicles were stolen in Britain and the authorities believe and many of these will have been exported.

Experts are concerned that thieves may even be using computer malware to take over vehicle systems via satellite, issuing remote commands for them to unlock and start up.

Many devices can be bought cheaply online, often from websites based in Bulgaria. They are accompanied by video tutorials posted online.

The problem was first exposed several years ago in certain models, but police now suspect that all modern makes are potentially vulnerable.

Police advise car owners to leave their cars in well-lit areas, to consider using steering, gear shift and pedal locks, as well as tracking devices.

Mike Hawes, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Limited, called on the Government to introduce stronger regulation to prevent vehicle diagnostic equipment falling into the wrong hands.

He said: ‘The challenge remains that some forms of keyless theft involve equipment legitimately available to workshops for routine repairs and servicing, and a small minority of individuals are exploiting this to access vehicles illegally.’
