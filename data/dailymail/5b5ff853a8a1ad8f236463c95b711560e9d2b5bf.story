A manhunt is underway today after a music fan died following a savage beating at a festival.

Robert Hart, 26, suffered fatal head injuries after being attacked in front of his girlfriend last Saturday as he danced with her in front of the main stage at the Parklife Weekender Festival in Heaton Park, Manchester.

The attack took place as R&B star Snoop Dogg was due to perform and was thought to have been sparked by an inflatable doll being thrown into the crowd.

Greater Manchester Police have released an e-fit image, left, of a man they are hunting after Robert Hart, right, died in hospital having been punched at the Parklife event in Heaton Park, Manchester on Saturday night

The shocking attack, which was caught on camera, left Robert Hart in a 'critical' condition after he was knocked unconscious. He died in hospital on Wednesday.

Mr Hart, from Macclesfield, Cheshire 
went to stop his girlfriend being hit with the inflatable but he was 
punched to the floor and knocked unconscious.

Two off-duty medic who 
were at the event to watch live music, rushed to his aid and gave Mr 
Hart CPR and he was rushed to hospital but he died four days later in 
hospital after suffering a bleed to the brain.

His parents and girlfriend were thought to be at his bedside.

Police have now issued a e-fit of the prime suspect as detectives urged him to give himself up.

Mr Hart, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, was knocked unconscious and was treated at the scene by two off-duty medical personnel, said Greater Manchester Police.

Detective Inspector Richard Eales said: 'Our immediate thoughts go out to Robert’s family and loved ones. We currently have specially trained officers with them to help through this terrible time.

'We are still in the early stages of this investigation.

'However
 several witnesses have assisted us with vital information concerning 
the description of the offender. We believe a confrontation took place 
following an inflatable doll hitting Robert’s girlfriend.

'We are aware other assaults took place in the park that evening but I am specifically appealing for witnesses who recall seeing the inflatable doll and the attack on Robert immediately thereafter.

'I am keen for those witnesses to come forward and other persons nearby who may have mobile phone footage of the attack or captured an image of the person responsible.

'Finally if you are the man responsible or were with him that evening, please come forward.'

The fatal beating occurred at around 9.15pm when Mr Hart and his girlfriend were in front of the Festival's main stage.

He was initially taken to a medical tent by security officers being being rushed to North Manchester General Hospital.

His condition deteriorated and he was later transferred to Hope Hospital in Salford where he died on Wednesday.

Police said the attacker is mixed race, in his late 20's and around 6ft 1 tall and was muscular with short, dark hair shaved at the sides. He was also wearing shorts and a blue, bomber-style jacket with the letter 'A' in white on the front.

A spokeswoman for Parklife said: 'We pride ourselves on a history of Parklife Weekender without any incidents.

'We regret that an isolated incident has taken place at this year's event.

'However, medics were on the scene within minutes of it taking place. We urge festival-goers to help the police identify the individual involved and contact them if they have any information at all.'

Mr Hart worked at Burton's menswear on Mill Street in Macclesfield town centre while he was studying his A-Levels.

His former colleague, Casey Smith, who still works at the store, said she was 'deeply saddened', by news of his death.

She said: 'I took Rob on at the shop in 2004 and he worked every weekend, and some week days when I could prize him out of his bed. He went off to study at university in 2006, I think it was Liverpool.

'He was a lovely, down-to-earth lad with an excellent sense of humour.

'I was only talking about him the other day. It's really sad.'
