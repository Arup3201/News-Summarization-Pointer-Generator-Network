The White House is apologizing for US soldiers burning of Muslim holy books in a pile of garbage at an American military base in Afghanistan.

Press secretary Jay Carney said it was a 'deeply unfortunate incident' and doesn't reflect the respect the US military has for the religious practices of the Afghan people.

More than 2,000 furious Afghans - 
some chanting ‘die, die foreigners’, other throwing rocks - gathered 
outside the giant US air base at Bagram, 40 miles north of the capital 
Kabul, as reports of the burning spreads.

Military sources told the Associated Press that books were removed from the library of a nearby detention center because they contained extremist messages. Prisoners had been writing in the books as way of communicating.

Carney echoed military officials Tuesday in saying that the Quran burning at Bagram Air Field happened unintentionally, and that an investigation was being undertaken to understand why it did and ensure it didn't happen again.

He said the administration was following the matter closely.

The US commander of Nato troops in Afghanistan, General John Allen, was forced to apologise over the claims that foreign troops had ‘improperly disposed’ of copies of the Koran.

But there were immediate fears the Taliban and other insurgent groups would try to exploit the claims, using it as a rallying call against US, British and fellow Coalition forces.

The protests come as the FBI announced it has removed hundreds of pages of training documents that painted inaccurate or stereotypical views of Islam.

The counter-terrorism training materials referred to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam, as a cult leader and included graphs that implied devout Muslims got more violent throughout history, while Jews and Christians became less violent.

FBI Director Robert Mueller announced the review after Wired Magazine posted copies of some of the offending documents online.

The FBI says, the documents tossed out in the months-long ininvestigation represent less than 1 percent of the bureau's training materials.

Meanwhile, New York City's mayor faced off with the president of Yale University on Monday over efforts by the city's police department to monitor Muslim student groups.

The Associated Press revealed over the weekend that in recent years, the NYPD has kept close watch on Muslim student associations across the Northeast.

The effort that included daily tracking of student websites and blogs, monitoring who was speaking to the groups, and in one case sending an undercover officer on a whitewater rafting trip with students from the City College of New York.

Yale President Richard Levin was among a number of academics who condemned the effort in a statement Monday, while Rutgers University and leaders of student Muslim groups elsewhere called for investigations into the monitoring.

'I am writing to state, in the strongest possible terms, that police surveillance based on religion, nationality, or peacefully expressed political opinions is antithetical to the values of Yale, the academic community, and the United States,' Levin wrote.

Speaking to reporters later Monday, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg dismissed those criticisms as baseless.

'I don't know why keeping the country safe is antithetical to the values of Yale,' he said.

He said it was 'ridiculous' to argue that there was anything wrong with officers keeping an eye on websites that are available to the general public.
