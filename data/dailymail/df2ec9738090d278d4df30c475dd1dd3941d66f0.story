A harrowing recording of the emergency services initial radio response to the Denver shooting has revealed how officers were desperately trying to save the lives of victims in the chaotic aftermath.

The radio call starts off with the operator telling the units: 'They are saying there is hundreds of people just running around.'

As the gravity of the situation becomes clear the operator urgently demands: 'All units respond to the theatre.'

Desperate: A harrowing recording of the emergency services initial radio response to the Denver shooting has revealed how officers were desperately trying to save the lives of victims in the chaotic aftermath

As she relays information to the officers about the shooting in theatre nine, they begin to radio in news of victims they are discovering.

One officer says: 'Somebody is spraying gas in here too' in reference to the smoke grenade James Holmes, 24, allegedly threw into the packed theatre before opening fire.

Another officer radios in: 'I got another person shot here, female. I got people running out the theatre.

Concern about the gas is evident when an officer asks: 'Do we have gas mask available?'

Cordoned off: A decision is made to move all the victims to the north end of the theatre as a perimeter is set up around the building

The operator responds: 'Can any units bring gas masks to theatre 9? We need gas masks.'

Again a panicked voice is heard saying: 'We can't get in the theatre. We need gas masks.'

Officers outside the building then radio in about finding a suspect.

'I need a marked car behind the theatre...suspect in a gas mask,' says one officer and states that the suspect's car is white and in the rear car park.

Another responds: 'Yes we got rifles, gas mask, he's detained right now.' 

Terrifying: Screams can be heard in the background when one officer says: 'I got two victims of the east side north side of the theatre - I need an ambulance real quick'

A decision is made to move all the victims to the north end of the theatre as a perimeter is set up around the building.

Screams can be heard in the background when one officer says: 'I got two victims of the east side north side of the theatre - I need an ambulance real quick.'

Several officers start radioing in asking for medical assistance and the frustration can be heard when one person says 'I got one ambulance - where my ambulances at?

As the chaos continues, with hundreds of people running around, an officer says: 'I am taking one male to hospital in my car.'

Discovery: Officers outside the building then radio in about finding a suspect. 'I need a marked car behind the theatre...suspect in a gas mask,' says one officer and states that the suspect's car is white.

As the police move into the theatre, the distress one responder on the scene feels is evident when he says: 'I got a child victim, I need rescue at the back door of theatre 9 now!'

The film, The Dark Knight Rises, is clearly still playing as the officers move thorough the auditorium and one radios in urgently requesting:

'I need someone to shut this movie off at nine. Have them shut this movie off at nine.'

With dozens of people injured and several dying from their wounds in the auditorium, an officer asks: 'Do I have permission to start taking some of these victims out ...  we have a whole bunch of people out here and no rescue.'

The response he receives is: 'Yeah load them up, get them in the car, get them out of here!'

The officers are told to check behind the screens - presumably for people who had scrambled to safety or for the suspect- because the 'auditoriums are open.'

They are reassured that more ambulances are arriving from other areas.

Information: Police officers took witness statements following the early morning shooting

Police identify a suspect and describe him as wearing a 'Black camouflage outfit, unknown race, wearing a vest, gas mask, long-gun.'

As news of the shooting spreads worried, families beginning to arrive at the scene, wanting to find out which hospital their children are in.

An officer asks: 'I got parents showing up saying they got kids involved that are being transported - do we have a list?'

The operator responds: 'Unfortunately no, we are using any available hospital at this point.'
