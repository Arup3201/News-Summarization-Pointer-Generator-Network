Team news 

Newcastle 

Cheick Tiote will miss Newcastle's  Premier League clash with Liverpool on Saturday after failing to shake off a calf problem.

The Ivory Coast midfielder has not figured for the Magpies since his return from international duty earlier this month, and will sit out once again.

Striker Papiss Cisse is also a doubt after suffering a reaction to the screws used to repair his fractured kneecap, while central defender Mike Williamson will not be risked unless he has fully recovered from a muscle strain.

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Dummett, Haidara, R. Taylor, Coloccini, S. Taylor, Anita, Abeid, Sissoko, Colback, Cabella, Gouffran, Obertan, Ameobi, Aarons, Riviere, Cisse, Perez, Armstrong.

Liverpool 

Liverpool have no fresh injury concerns ahead of Saturday's trip to Newcastle.

Daniel Sturridge (calf), Mamadou Sakho (thigh) and Jon Flanagan (knee) remain unavailable for selection, along with ex-Magpie Jose Enrique, who Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has confirmed is sidelined by a knee issue.

In Sturridge's absence, Rodgers will once again make a call on the best option in attack from Fabio Borini, Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli, who is the only one of the trio to have scored this season and broke an eight-match goal drought earlier this week.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Johnson, Lovren, Skrtel, Moreno, Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Lallana, Balotelli, Sterling, Jones, Manquillo, Toure, Can, Markovic, Lucas, Coutinho, Lambert, Borini.
