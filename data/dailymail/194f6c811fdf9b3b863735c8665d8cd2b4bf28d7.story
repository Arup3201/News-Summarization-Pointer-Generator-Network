The grieving relatives of a British doctor who they claim was murdered in a Syrian prison have unveiled plans to sue president Bashar al-Assad.

Abbas Khan died in jail in the country’s capital Damascus last December having written to his family in south London telling of his mistreatment by his captors.

A jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing at an inquest, held in Britain, in to the 32-year-old’s death last month.

Now his family plan to launch a compensation claim against the Syrian president and want to bring the country's authorities before the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

Dr Khan’s family claim he was murdered, but the Syrian government has always maintained that the orthopaedic surgeon killed himself and was found hanging in a jail cell.

Dr Khan’s sister Sara Khan told the BBC: ‘At the moment, there are individuals who wanted my brother dead and as a family we should be able to find out who these people are and why.

‘We want to take this to the International Criminal Court in The Hague and claim compensation from the Syrian authorities.’

'It is a very complex case and it is not going to be easy, it might take many years.'

Dr Khan was detained just days after travelling to Syria having made the dangerous journey with the intention of helping victims of the war.

An inquest heard how Dr Khan's mother, Fatima Khan, travelled to the war-town country alone in July last year, where she risked her life in  Damascus to find out which prison was holding him

An inquest in London heard how his mother, Fatima Khan, travelled to the war-town country alone in July last year, where she risked her life in  Damascus to find out which prison was holding him.

Mrs Khan, who did not speak any Arabic, went from embassy to embassies and prisons - armed only with chocolates and a photo of her son.

Some of the buildings she went to were shaken by bomb blasts, and vans she travelled in came under sniper fire. 

At the end of July, she saw her son at the Court of Terrorism, where she told him, 'Mummy is here for you', before she threw herself at the judge's feet - begging him for mercy.

But in the end, her efforts were not enough to save her 'angelic' child.

Grieving: A funeral service for Dr Khan was held at The London Central Mosque last December

On the day of his death she was taken by armed men to a high-security prison in Damascus and told Dr Khan was fine when he was given breakfast.

But, two hours later, he was found unwell with foam coming out of his mouth, and a doctor was checking on him. 

During a two-week hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, the jury of seven men and four women heard there was no evidence that Dr Khan, who was captured in Aleppo in November 2012 after travelling from Turkey, had gone to Syria to fight. 

The jury said the medical cause of Dr Khan's death was 'unascertained’. Dr Khan died on December 16, 2013 in an ‘unknown prison or place of detention’ in Damascus, it said.
