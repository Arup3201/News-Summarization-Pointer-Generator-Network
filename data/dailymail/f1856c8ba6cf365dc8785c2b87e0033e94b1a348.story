Police said
the couple were walking home after watching a Seattle Sounders soccer match when they
were attacked for no apparent reason.

Troy Wolff, 46,
and his girlfriend, Kristen Ito, 30, were confronted by a man who pulled out a small knife and
began stabbing Miss Ito repeatedly in the torso on Friday night.

Kathie Hunt,
a friend of Wolff, said he was a genuine person who will be desperately missed.

'It
doesn't surprise me that he spent time protecting people he loved at the
end,' she said. She said
Wolff loved to travel and taught abroad. He also enjoyed the outdoors and
sports.

On his
Facebook page, Wolff posted a photo Friday night from CenturyLink Field. He
wrote: 'Cheap seats, great match.'

The 44-year-old suspect was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in Kings County Jail. There are no other suspects.

Police said
he was not known to the victims.
