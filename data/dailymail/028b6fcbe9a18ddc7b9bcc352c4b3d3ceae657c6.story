The only son of Marion Barry, a former Washington mayor who once left office in disgrace after being caught smoking crack cocaine, is seeking his late father's seat on the D.C. Council. 

Marion Christopher Barry, 34, picked up nominating petitions Monday at the District of Columbia Board of Elections. His father suffered a fatal cardiac arrest last November aged 78.

The son, who currently runs a small construction company, becomes one of 23 candidates bidding to make the ballot for an April special election for the council seat.

The elder Barry represented Ward 8 - the poorest section of the nation's capital - for the last ten years of his life. 

He remained beloved by many though his citywide popularity never fully recovered after 1990 when he was videotaped in an FBI sting taking drags from a crack pipe and arrested on drug charges.

His son, who goes by the name Christopher, has had his own run-ins with the law.

The younger Barry has been arrested three times on drug and traffic charges, most recently last July, when he was jailed after he was caught driving on a revoked license. 

He pleaded guilty to that charge in December and is currently serving nine months' probation and undergoing drug and alcohol treatment.

'That's definitely all behind me. Like most young people, I've gone through my phases and experimented in drugs. 

'I paid a great price for that and I've learned from my mistakes,' Barry said.

'I feel as though that experience has made me more qualified to help people who have gone through rough times in life.'

Barry has worked as a subcontractor on numerous city government projects, including school construction, through his building business.

He said in an interview that he's always had political ambitions even though he hasn't discussed them publicly. 

He said his father urged him to run for the seat one day.

'I always admired him, not just as my father but who he was as a leader, and I always took notes when I was around him,' Barry said. 

'I've been living this for 34 years. It's really a part of my life.'

He has filed as a candidate under the name Marion C. Barry.
