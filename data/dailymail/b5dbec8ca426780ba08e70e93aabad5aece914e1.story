A Wisconsin mother of four has been arrested after police say three of her children were killed in a fire while being home alone.

During a press conference Friday, officials in West Allis said twin 4-year-old boys and a 5-year-old girl died in the house fire Thursday.

According to local authorities, there was no adult in the home at the time the fire ignited and that the mother is now being questioned in connection to the tragedy.

Agents from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the state Department of Justice are investigating the case.

The fire erupted inside a home at 7750 West Hicks Street at around 5.20pm Thursday.

First responders arrived on the scene three minutes after getting a 911 call and discovered the two-story residence engulfed in flames and filled with thick black smoke.

Once firefighters extinguished the inferno and secured the scene, they entered the house, where they discovered the bodies of three young children in a second-floor bedroom.

Acting Police Chief Chuck Padgett said autopsies will be performed on the victims to determine the exact cause of death.

‘The City of West Allis is mourning this loss of life and the mourning is intensified by the fact that they were children,’ said West Allis Mayor Dan Devine during a news conference on Thursday.

The cause of the blaze has yet to be 
determined. Fire officials say smoke detectors were working on the first
and second floors of the home.

Fire
officials say flames burned a large hole through the floor at the 
entrance of the second-story bedroom, which hampered their rescue 
efforts. 

Heartbreaking moment: Neighbors saw the mother of four running on the street towards her ravaged house about two hours after the fire

According to local residents, the mother of the three young victims, who also has a fourth child - an infant who was not home at the time of the fire - returned home at around 7.30pm and was seen running towards her gutted residence, JSOnline.com reported.

The woman was taken into custody for questioning, and police say she is cooperating with the investigation.

A neighbor told the station WISN 12 that the family have been renting the home on West Hicks Street for about a year.

On Friday, police towed away a minivan believed to belong to the woman. Toy trucks and a stuffed animal were left behind on the front lawn of the ravaged house.

The deadly fire comes less than a month after two young boys died when a hme in West Allis caught fire in the middle of the night.
