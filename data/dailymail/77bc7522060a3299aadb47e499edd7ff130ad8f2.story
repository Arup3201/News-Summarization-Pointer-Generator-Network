Lisa Dolan was given a 20-month suspended sentence by a judge at Liverpool Crown Court yesterday

A SINGLE mother caught with £2million worth of  cannabis in her home has been spared jail.

When detectives raided Lisa Dolan’s home and found 450lb of cannabis resin hidden in bags, she told them: ‘It’s not mine – I’m minding it for a couple days for £500.’

The 39-year-old added that she had hidden the vast haul – which made her home in Liverpool ‘positively hum’ with the odour – because it would be ‘easy money’.

But in an extraordinary decision, a judge allowed her to walk free from court with a suspended prison sentence.

After hearing her 13-year-old son would be taken into care if Dolan went to prison – the boy’s father is already behind bars – Judge Stephen Clark took pity on her.

‘We know compassion is a dirty word, but there is still room for it,’ he said.

The case comes after police chiefs were criticised for quietly introducing a softer policy on illegal drug taking. Yesterday anti-drugs campaigners criticised the sentence.

They said it sent out the wrong message at a time of mounting fears about the health effects of super-strong ‘skunk’ cannabis.

Dolan’s terraced house in a run-down estate in Netherton, Merseyside, was raided in November and 2,000 blocks of cannabis were found in packages and bags.

The total weight was 204kg (450lb) with a potential street value of £2million, Liverpool Crown Court was told.

Ben Jones, prosecuting, said the house ‘positively hummed’ with the odour of the cannabis.

‘She must have been aware of the quantity,’ he added.

Dolan, who is believed to be unemployed, initially told police she was ‘minding’ the drugs for a man she barely knew called ‘Jim’ and for only a couple of days.

The court heard that Dolan was the sole carer for her 13-year-old son, who faced being taken into care if she went to prison

However the court was told that she 
had since admitted she was aware of the identity of the person who asked
her to hide them, and a separate prosecution is understood to be in 
progress. Mr Jones said she blamed being behind on loan  repayments and 
financial difficulties from her son’s father being in prison. ‘She said 
she fell to the temptation of easy money,’ he added.

Charlotte Kenny, defending, said Dolan was worried about both her son and her father, who requires kidney dialysis.

‘She did not appreciate the scale of 
the offence,’ she added. ‘Her main concern was to provide for her son 
and she is greatly concerned about him having to go into care.’

Dolan's suspended sentence comes after Judge Peter Bowers let a convicted paedophile and a burglar walk free from court with suspended jail terms

Dolan, who sobbed in the dock, pleaded
guilty to possessing cannabis with intent to supply. Judge Clark told 
her: ‘I don’t know what you were thinking to get yourself involved. I 
presume you were under pressure and felt some loyalty.’

But he said he wasn’t going to send 
her to prison, describing her as a hard-working woman who played a big 
part in helping her family and pointing out she had no previous 
convictions.

‘Your concerns throughout have been 
for your son,’ he said. ‘You realise now how appallingly you let him 
down. I don’t think you will be back before the courts again.’

He imposed a 20-month suspended sentence along with 120 hours’ unpaid work.

Yesterday anti-drug campaigner Mary 
Brett, of Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘This sentence sends out 
completely the wrong message – dealers will feel nothing’s going to 
happen to them.

‘Today’s strong varieties of cannabis 
lead to psychosis and violence, and I would have thought that at the 
very least a short, sharp shock of a jail sentence would be appropriate 
for possessing such a shocking amount.’

New drugs sentencing guidelines 
published last year were branded ‘soft justice’ after it emerged that 
dealers could be spared jail even if they are arrested with as much as 
6kg (13lb) of cannabis.
