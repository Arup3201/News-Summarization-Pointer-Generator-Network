First there were the pictures of debauched racegoers rolling round the paddocks after the Melbourne Cup.

And now there is this jaw-dropping video showing a woman in a tight blue dress, fascinator and high heels so punch-drunk she’s prepared to take on the entire crowd.

The footage, shot at Flemington Racecourse and posted by Gavin Caporn, features her throwing wild punches, collapsing on the floor and eventually being pinned down.

Her astonishing antics provoke a wealth of comments. ‘Oh, she’s terrible,’ one woman says before a male voice advises ‘Just walk away mate,’ to someone on the receiving end of her fist.

Five security guards eventually arrive to remove her.

Shocking: The unidentified black-haired woman, who was wearing a tight blue dress, matching blue hairpiece and black heels, was caught on camera at the Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, Australia

Undignified: The video, posted by a Gavin Caporn, showed the drunk woman stumbling around the grass without a security guard in sight, bumping into random people and falling over while shouting at the crowd

The footage is sure to provoke some 
more heated debate after a Mail Online article showing Melbourne’s 
finest running amok at the event went viral yesterday.

A slew of newspapers and TV shows 
featured the story with many appalled that the behaviour at Flemington 
had attracted such bad international press.

More than 70 racegoers were thrown out of the event after incidents involving alcohol.

Out of those, 39 were forced to leave for being intoxicated, four people were arrested for being drunk in public place and 29 were caught trying to bring alcohol into the racecourse.

Paramedics treated 23 racegoers mainly for alcohol-related problems.

But as the drunken behaviour at the event became the focus of the international press, others were only too keen to highlight Britain’s own less than salubrious record at sporting events.

Debauched scenes from recent race 
meetings such Aintree and even Royal Ascot where a picture of a drunken 
thug swigging a bottle of pink champagne horrified Mail Online readers.

Crowd watches on: A clip emerged today of the female racegoer so drunk that she was flinging wild punches at anybody near her, falling over, exposing her underwear and eventually being hauled away by security

Going nowhere: She is pinned down by a man, while shouts of ‘Get this b***h out of here’ and ‘Where's security?’ are heard. Someone shouts: ‘Calm down sweetheart’ and another jokes: ‘Take your missus home’

Fun's over: The woman shouts at the crowd: 'Ah you dumb f**ks' and another person shouts: 'Just another day at the races'. Then there are cheers as five security guards arrive to take her away from the area

One Australian newspaper accused our ‘trashbag’ nation of ‘chaotic scenes’ and being a ‘frolicking mess’.

‘Back in the Old Dart, Royal Ascot's 
finest must have been choking on their foie gras and desperately 
pondering just how we let it come to this,’ Aaron Langmaid wrote in 
Melbourne’s Herald Sun.

‘We have always done it differently 
Down Under. We've learnt to excuse those regrettable back tattoos, white
leather shoes and bum-skimming skirts. It's cheap entertainment, after 
all.’

He added that Britons ‘sugar-coat’ 
the Wimbledon tennis tournament to be about ‘dining on wild strawberries
draped in freshly whipped cream and watching the greats of the game do 
battle.’

But we ‘fail to mention the 
frolicking mess that is Henman Hill, where cross-eyed tennis fans purge 
themselves of excess liquor before rolling down the mound after yet 
another Brit fails to make the finals’.

He said people must step over 
‘acid-tripping hippies’ at the Notting Hill Carnival and Boat Race fans 
are seen ‘chugging down pints of Stella Artois and blabbering on about 
the Premiership League’.

The paper also lambasted Britain’s 
‘dramatically inconsistent take on public etiquette’ after scenes of 
drunkenness when an alcohol ban was launched in 2008 on the London 
Underground.

In addition it wrote of ‘a shameful 
wake of locals who stumbled out of stations, hitching up their dresses 
and doing up their flies and wobbling off into the night’.

Meanwhile news.com.au asked the 
question: ‘The Melbourne Cup party stopped a nation, but is it the 
British who don't know how to have fun?’

Social networks were abuzz with 
Australians claiming British coverage of the race was hard on them. Alex
Cauchi said: ‘Bit rich of the poms to lecture us on how we handle our 
grog.’

Robyn Westbury added: ‘They're only 
p****d off because they don't have a big day to match ours :) whinging 
poms never happy unless they are whinging..lol’

Commentary: The response to MailOnline's story in the Australian media was far from complimentary

And Pauline O'Brien said: ‘They're only interested cos Charlies here! At least there was no nudity eh Harry??’

The Melbourne Cup attracted 105,000 
people yesterday, including the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall who are on 
the Australia leg of their Jubilee tour.

A two-mile event, the race has become a social, cultural and sporting icon with attendees sporting their finest clothes.

But in time-honoured fashion, as the 
champagne flowed and races were won - or lost - the racegoers became 
ever-more dishevelled, with some kicking off their shoes to feel the 
grass of the race track under their bare feet.

British racing meets have long had a 
reputation for getting a bit messy as the day develops, but the 
hedonistic Melbourne crowds showed the UK that they can party just as 
hard.

Some rolled around in the paddock 
revealing their knickers, others sipped drinks through the mouth of a 
giant horse head, while those who'd got luck somewhere other than at the
tote got stuck in to passionate kissing sessions.

Nonetheless, the day's racing was 
deemed a resounding success, with Amanda Elliott, vice chairman of the 
Victoria Racing Club (VRC) which runs the Melbourne Cup, saying Camilla 
for one declared she was 'absolutely delighted' to be at the race course
and 'could not believe' the crowds.

The Melbourne Cup is one of the 
richest flat races in the world with a total prize money pot of around 
£4 million and attracts riders, owners and horses from across the globe.
