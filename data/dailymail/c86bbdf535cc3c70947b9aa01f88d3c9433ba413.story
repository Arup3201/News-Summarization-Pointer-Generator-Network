This is the moment an armed robber burst into a North Tyneside store with a handgun, stole the store's money then apologised to the shopkeeper before running off.

Police now are hunting the masked raider after the attack, which happened just before 7am yesterday at Diane's Newsagency, in Angle Terrace, Wallsend.

The 46-year-old member of staff, Jeanette Greenwell, from Wallsend, was shocked but otherwise uninjured.

She said the attacker cocked his gun - but before he ran off, he apologised to her.

Mrs Greenwell, who a mother to Danielle, 23, Jamie, 22, and Shane, 15, said: 'I had my head down sorting out paperwork and I heard a customer come in because the chime on the door sounded.

'The next thing I knew when I looked up a man in a balaclava had a gun pointing at me in my face. At first I thought it was a wind up.

'He wanted the money in the till so I handed it over to him. I think he roughly only got away with around £80 because I had only been open an hour, I told him it was all I had in the till.

'I wondered at first whether it was a real gun but when I saw him pull it back, I panicked and started frantically searching in the till.'

'The strange thing was, he said "sorry" to me then ran off. It makes me think that he must have known me because why would you rob someone and then say sorry for it?

'It doesn't make any sense.'

The robber demands all the money in the shop till, which Mrs Greenwell later said totalled about £80

Northumbria Police said money was handed over and the man left the shop with the cash in a small plastic bag.

The suspect was tall and had a slim build. He was wearing a black balaclava over his face, a yellow hoodie with the hood up, blue jeans and dark footwear.

Stills from the CCTV showed the robber to be armed with what appeared to be a gun before he made off with the cash, passing two customers on the way out.

Mrs Greenwell, who is married to Paul, a 44-year-old taxi driver, said: 'One of the customers tried to follow the robber in his car while the other looked after me while I dialled 999.

'It's a really close knit community around here and the owners, Bob and Diane, say they have never had something like this happen in the 30 years that they have run the store.

'You usually know everyone who comes in the shop. The shock hasn't sunk in yet, I'm still waiting for it to hit me but I'll still be returning to work, I've got a mortgage to pay.

Bob Patterson (pictured) said it was the first time he had been robbed  in the 30 years he has owned the store

'I think it's quite risky of the guy to pull a stunt like that all for the sake of £80.'

Police are now appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to contact them as soon as possible.

Police Chief Inspector Steve Readdie, of North Tyneside Area Command, said: 'We have extra officers on patrol in the area to reassure residents and answer any concerns people may have.'

Anyone with information should contact police on 101, extension 69191, quoting log number 166 of 06/02/15 or ring the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
