However much Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez might have in common, and however close their two teams might have been in terms of points prior to this encounter, here was a Merseyside derby that highlighted the gulf that still remains.

It is a gulf in quality and resources on the pitch. A gulf that means Liverpool can boast one of the finest front lines in Europe, all bought and paid for thank you very much, while Everton are still picking up bargains in the loan market.

Take nothing away from Brendan Rodgers and his players here at Anfield. They were magnificent; a superb attacking force that demonstrated to devastating effect that, of the two teams in residence either side of Stanley Park, they are the better equipped to challenge for a Champions League place this season. Perhaps even the title.

But while Rodgers watched Luis Suarez
 and Daniel Sturridge once again combine to destroy another Premier 
League defence, Martinez had to try and respond with his attack all but 
neutralised by the loss of Romelu Lukaku to what looked like a nasty 
ankle injury.

That Martinez
 had to turn to Steven Naismith as a replacement really said as much as 
the fact that Lukaku remains a 20-year-old on loan from Chelsea. Rather 
than throw money at Suarez, Everton’s supporters might have been better 
served donating it to their club.

Lukaku’s
 premature departure does not explain how Everton proved so ineffective 
in containing Liverpool’s forwards when they came here to Anfield having
 lost only twice in the Premier League this season.

But
 a team lacking any real punch at one end will always suffer at the 
other and so it was for an Everton side left crushed by their rampant 
rivals.

There were other 
issues for Martinez. As well as the absence of Sylvain Distin and Seamus
 Coleman in his back four, it was clear that Phil Jagielka, Ross Barkley
 and Steven Pienaar were lacking fitness after their recent injury 
problems.

But this remained
 an uncharacteristic performance from Everton and one that Martinez will
 not be prepared to accept whatever obstacles they had to overcome. He 
expects his team to be organised and disciplined. Not in total disarray.

Gareth
 Barry, another loan signing it is worth remembering, had been brilliant
 for Martinez but he had a night he will certainly want to forget. Not 
only was he at fault for two of Liverpool’s goal, it was his collision 
with Lukaku that left the Belgian forward leaving the field on a 
stretcher.

For the two 
managers it meant this derby was much like their respective exits from 
Swansea City. Joyous for one and bloody uncomfortable for the other.

While
 Rodgers was thanked for guiding the club into the Premier League before
 heading off to Anfield, the circumstances of Martinez’s departure were 
rather more acrimonious.

In
 2009 Martinez planned to marry in the Welsh city, and such was his 
popularity as the football club’s forward-thinking manager he and his 
future wife found that nobody would take their money for organising 
their nuptials. Until, that is, he announced his intention to move to 
Wigan.

Suddenly the 
bills started coming through the letter box and by the time they arrived
 at their wedding day they needed the assistance of South Wales police 
to ensure that there was no trouble at the church.

That
 anger and resentment has now subsided, to be fair, and Swansea 
supporters would probably agree that the two managers who played such an
 important role in their rise to the top flight share certain qualities.

Martinez
 introduced a continental style of play Rodgers also subscribed to when 
he took control at The Liberty Stadium and it is fascinating to see 
these two men now applying those same principles here on Merseyside.

But this was not the best night for making those comparisons.

They
 are similar even if one is Catalan and the other Northern Irish. They 
are virtually the same age, they rank among the sharper dressed Premier 
League managers, and they have an appetite for flair and adventure as 
well as a tactical, methodical approach.

The
 derby back in November at Goodison was a better example of the 
philosophies they share; a 3-3 draw that was memorable for some stunning
 attacking football by both teams.

Here
 at Anfield last night they certainly started with the intent of 
producing a spectacle at the same high-octane level, with both men 
opting for the same 4-2-3-1 formation.

In red and blue there are players to thrill and inspire too. Suarez and Barkley for a start.

Bad night: Romelu Lukaku struggles off the pitch after colliding with Gareth Barry

But
 by the time Suarez had raced away from Jagielka to score Liverpool’s 
fourth, Martinez could only look in in agony; his arms folded, his glare
 fixed on players and his jaw going ten to a dozen on a piece of gum.

Ok. It was not as bad as that day in Swansea. There will be no need for police protection here.

But
 to be an Everton manager on the end of a thumping like this is no fun 
at all. And certainly not the night for celebrating the respective 
qualities of two fine young managers in Liverpool. Better to focus on 
two very fine forwards, from England and Uruguay. As well as one or two 
others in red.
