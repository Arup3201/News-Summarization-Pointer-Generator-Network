Islamic State militants  have publicly beheaded two of their own fighters after they were accused of 'banditry' and spying on behalf of the Syrian government.

The executions took place in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group's police force and brought before a Sharia law court.

One of the men was successfully tried on charges of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money', while the second man was convicted of 'spying and embezzlement', with both being sentenced to being beheaded in the centre of Al-Bukamal, which is on the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq.

News of the executions came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group monitoring violence in Syria using sources on the ground.

The first man, they said, was convicted of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money' - a charge likely to have been linked to the practice of money lending or usury. 

The second militants was accused of 'dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,' according to the Observatory. 

The use of the phrase 'electronic chips' is understood to refer to small geolocation devices that can be hidden inside ISIS-held buildings or vehicles belonging to senior militants.

The devices can then provide Syrian regime warplanes with detailed information on which to base a bombing raid.

Charlie Winter, a programs officer at counter-extremism think tank Quilliam, told The Independent that reports of ISIS executing their own fighters are not unsurprising.

'Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them. They do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime which goes against their interpretation of sharia, such as usury or embezzlement,' he said. 

'Jihadist groups have a strict no corruption policy, meaning that while they can benefit financially from charging bank transactions and claiming a percentage of everyone's monthly income, they don't extort people like some secular groups have done in the past,' he added. 

The news comes as it emerged as many as 30 Britons may now have died fighting for terror groups in Syria.

Researchers believe 24 jihadists have been killed fighting with Islamic State and other groups but think the true figure is higher.

Despite the deaths and mounting political pressure on extremist groups both at home and abroad, there remains little consensus on how prevent radicalisation of more British nationals. 

Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq have released a new video showing fighters speaking in English, French and German making threats against Western soldiers.

Saying they look forward to slaughtering any Western ground troops sent to the region, the terrorists threatened to 'chop off the heads of whoever you may bring'.

None of the men in the clip wear masks, although only three of them speak to the camera. One of the jihadists, identified by the nom de guerre Abu Abdullah al-Britani, speaks in a clear southern English accent, while the other two men identify themselves as French and German nationals respectively.

Showing chilling bravado, the man calling himself  Abu Abdullah al-Britani urges Western nations to send their troops to the region so that ISIS can 'kill every single soldier, Allah permitting.'

'We will take their weaponry as booty and these people will die… You cannot come into Iraq and think that you will take it. No way. We are willing to lay down our blood on this soil,' he adds.

Gesticulating wildly, the Muslim fanatic goes on to say: 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans, chop off the heads of the French, chop off the heads of whoever you may bring.' 

He goes on to insist that the Islamic State have no chose of losing the battle against the West because they are backed by God, before saying 'Know that we are fighting to die... and know that you are fighting for this world and that this is nothing to us.

Referring to Western airstrikes that have targeted ISIS in recent weeks, including those that have forced militants to abandon key locations in and around the besieged Syrian city of Kobane, al-Britani insists that bombing raids 'will not divert us from our plans'.

He says that strikes 'only strengthen us, and give us more purpose to be here' before threatening to take the lives of any Westerner fighting against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. 

Once al-Britani eventually stops talking, a man identified as Abdul Wadoud al-Firansi emerges in front of the camera and speaks in perfect French, with English subtitles appearing below.

Addressing his messages to 'the swine Francois Hollande', al-Firansi reads out religious passages and accuses the French president of using his country's wealth to turn people away from Islam.

'Wait. We are also waiting,' he says. 'Everybody knows how much money you and you coalition have spent and lost in your war against Islam.'

The young militant, who appears to be missing several teeth, goes on to say: 'A great defeat shall befall you because Allah has promised that. You,. the coalition, will become the losers,' he adds.

Al-Firansi goes on to make references to a 1,300-year-old apocalyptic prophecy that predicted a war between an Islamic army and 'infidel horde' in Syria.

Al-Firansi refers to Westerners as 'Romans' throughout his rant, in the hope of drawing similarities between the apocalyptic predictions in the hadith, and the modern reality of a coalition of armies aiming to destroy the terrorists that have been raping and the massacring their way around the Middle East.

He finishes he message with the words: 'The reality is the Islamic State has returned. Victory after victory it gains territory... so die in your rage because this is the era of Islam.'

Militant: Once al-Firansi finishes speaking, another militant identified as Abu Dauoud al-Almani (centre) steps in front of the camera and speaks in German, which is again subtitled in English

Once al-Firansi finishes speaking, another militant identified as Abu Dauoud al-Almani steps in front of the camera and speaks in German, which is again subtitled in English.

He claims the video is being shot in the Syrian town of Dabiq - where the aforementioned apocalyptic prophecy is predicted to play out - and urges Western nations to send their armies to fight ISIS because 'We have been waiting for you for over 1,400 years.'

He also urges his fellow Muslims in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to join ISIS.
