A landowner is selling one of the Lake District's most famous peaks for £1.75m - and is hoping 'some daft Russian' will come along and take it off his hands.

Lord Hugh Lowther, the eight Earl of Lonsdale, is flogging the 3,000ft Blencathra mountain in a bid to pay off a £9m inheritance bill.

But the 64-year-old, who lives there with his third wife Lady Elizabeth, admits he needs some 'show off' to buy the iconic peak - because any prospective buyer won't be able to do anything with it.

Lord Hugh Lowther, the eighth Earl of Lonsdale, pictured with his wife Lady Elizabeth, is selling Blencathra mountain in the Lake District for £1.75m

The iconic mountain, commonly known as the Saddleback, is being sold - complete with a ceremonial lordship - to help pay off a £9m inheritance tax bill

Speaking to the Telegraph, Lord Lonsdale said: 'Who's got the money? We know the Chinese have got it, and the Russians
 have got it.

'We're hoping there will be some daft Russian (who wants 
it) to show off.'

The aristocrat, whose family has owned the peak for 400 years, has already sold a Turner painting, a derelict farm standing and a couple of vacant cottages to try and reduce his inheritance tax bill.

But with just 18 months to pay every penny, Lord Lonsdale decided it was time to sell the peak - with a ceremonial lordship title chucked in for free. 

Despite its stark beauty and prime location, Lord Lonsdale knows selling the peak will be hard work.

As it is part of the Lake District National Park, which is in Cumbria, any buyer will be unable to develop or build on the peak. 

Lord Lonsdale, 64, said he can think of 'better things to spend his money on' but hopes 'some daft Russian' will want the mountain so they can 'show off'

The new owner will also be unable to do anything about the thousands of walkers who cross the peak each year.

Lord Lonsdale admits he can 'think 
of better things' to spend his money on, but hopes an extravagant international might feel otherwise.

If his wish for a 'daft Russian' does not come true, Lord Lonsdale hopes the government or 
National Trust will step in instead.

He told the paper: 'Once the duties are gone, I can have a better way of life. I can
 go and buy myself a super yacht in the south of France or a house in 
the Bahamas. Why not?

The mountain, one of the most renowned landmarks in the Cumbrian national park, would still be protected from development even if it is sold

A favourite among tourists and walkers, is only the second mountain to be put on the market, after Snowdon in 1998

Estate agent John Robson said he hoped someone would buy it, in the same way someone might buy a 'stunning piece of artwork'

'We can still walk on it, and fly over it, and do what the hell we like with it. It's not going anywhere.'

Lord Lonsdale inherited the peak, which covers an area of 2,676 acres, from his father in 2006.

The iconic mountain is commonly known as Saddleback, due 
to the distinctive drop from its peak.

On a clear day, it gives view over to the Isle of Man and North Wales.

But Lord Lonsdale is still embarking on new ground. Blencathra is only the second mountain to be put on the market, since Snowdon went up for sale in 1998.

The peak, which has six separate fell tops, has been in the Lowther family for 400 years

Covering nearly 2,700 acres, the mountain gives stunning views, sometimes as far-reaching as the Isle of Man and North Wales

It will not have a For Sale sign to alert 
potential buyers, but the mountain will be advertised in a glossy 
brochure, before being bought under sealed bids.

Lord Lonsdale, who has several lordships under his belt, is also selling the lordship of the manor of Threlkeld - a ceremonial title, dating back to the 18th Century - to go with the mountain.

John Robson, managing director of Lonsdale Settlement Estates, said: 'It is one of the biggest tourist destinations in this country.

He said: 'We hope someone will buy it in 
the way they would buy a stunning piece of art work. But instead of a 
picture of the landscape you are getting the real thing.

Lord Lonsdale said he will still 'walk on it, fly over it and do what the hell we like with it' when he sells the iconic peak

Lord Lonsdale says he plans to buy a super yacht in the south of France or a house in the Bahamas once he sells Blencathra

'The mountain features in the Wainwright mountain guides. It is a unique opportunity to own something so unusual.

'It is the stand out mountain in the Lake District, with a truly beautiful landscape.'

The Lowther family have a long history and Lord Lonsdale's father, who was the seventh generation to own the land, inherted the estate in 1953, aged 39.

Blencathra's reputation as a tourist attraction has its roots in the 18th century, when people would travel by horseback or carriage along the new Penrith to Keswick turnpike road to enjoy the spectacular views.

It was also a favourite of the fell-walker and guide book author Alfred Wainwright.
