Sean Abbott has returned to training a week after the tragic accident which claimed the life of batsman Phillip Hughes. 

A bouncer delivered by Abbott struck Hughes, 25, in the back of the neck during the Sheffield Shield clash at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Thursday. He died surrounded in hospital by family and friends on Thursday.

Abbott's team, New South Wales, rallied around each other at a training session at the SCG on Tuesday.

A spokeswoman for Cricket NSW said: 'It's the whole squad that really needs everyone's support.

'We want to keep supporting them as a group there were a lot of Phillip's friends in the team.'

The team will fly together to Macksville, Hughes' hometown on the NSW north coast, on Wednesday morning and return Thursday.

The Sydney Cricket Ground will also be open to the public on Tuesday for the wider community to join celebrations of Hughes' life.

As Macksville readies for an influx of 5000 mourners, a member of Hughes' family told Daily Mail Australia they were planning to console Abbott. 

'We can't wait to see Sean Abbott tomorrow and give him a big kiss and hug,' the family member said. 

'We just want to tell him it was freak accident and he cannot think he had anything to do with it.

'No one is blaming him. We want to hug him and tell him that everything is OK.'

Last week, friends and mentors at the Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, the north-western Sydney institution where Abbott grew up belting balls, joined countless Australians in rallying around the up-and-coming-cricketer.

When one of Abbott's team-mates dropped a crucial catch as a youngster, he was always the good sportsman who would pat them on the back and reassure them it would be OK, they said.  

Ian Chatman, who managed Abbott's junior team for about eight years and witnessed his first century, told Daily Mail Australia he was a grounded young man who was 'loved by everyone, and still is.' 

'He was really loved by his team-mates, and he cared about them as well,' said Mr Chatman, who said Abbott would be 'devastated' by last Tuesday's events.

'He was always making sure that you know, if someone dropped a catch, he'd be over there patting them on the back saying, "Don't worry about it, it's okay".'  

Hughes' sister Megan and Australian skipper Michael Clarke both consoled the devastated cricketer in the immediate aftermath of his friend's death. And they were far from alone.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten both spoke in support of the struggling cricketer.

Former Australian national Test captain Adam Gilchrist tweeted: 'May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott'.   

Clarke will act as a pall bearer at Hughes' funeral and shared a photo of the pair on Instagram
