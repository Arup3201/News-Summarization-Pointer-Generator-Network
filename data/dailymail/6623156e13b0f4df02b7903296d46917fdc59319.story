Conservationists have launched an online petition to save a 45-year-old dolphin which they claim is being overworked and unfairly forced to kiss visitors to a marine park. 

Bucky is one of six dolphins which live at Dolphin Marine Magic park in Coffs Harbour, NSW, north of Sydney. Only he and one other dolphin were rescued, the other four were born in captivity.

Conservation group Australia For Dolphins (AFD) has gathered 11,200 signatures for its petition which aims to get the Department of Primary Industries to look into the conditions of the park - as well as the 'cruel' treatment the animals are forced to 'endure'.  

Bucky was rescued at just a year old and has been living at a marine park in Coffs Harbour, NSW, ever since

AFD claims Dolphin Marine Magic doesn't have adequate facilities and has 'strong evidence' that the centre is not complying with its exhibit licence. The park denies the claims.

Dolphin Marine Magic, which was opened in 1970, has been in conflict with original owner Hec Goodall since 2004 when he was 'pushed out' of the management side of the business - but the dispute took a new twist with the launch of the petition.

Critics claim the park's focus has shifted from rescue and rehabilitation to a 'money making enterprise', and say the pools are no longer big enough to house all the marine animals. 

Hec Goodall, who founded Porpoise Pool in 1970 opened the park as a rescue and rehabilitation centre for marine animals

The petition - which has over 11,200 signatures - says: 'At Dolphin Marine Magic dolphins are forced to perform in demeaning shows, swim with and kiss strangers, and even give members of the public 'rides' on a daily basis.

'... Not only that, but the size of the dolphin pool falls well short of legal specifications.' 

Advocacy director of AFD Jordan Sosnowski told Daily Mail Australia they hope this will push the marine park to realign their focus on caring for unwell animals rather than breeding them in captivity for shows.

'We were so happy with the public support we got, its calling on the Department of Primary Industries to undertake an investigation into Dolphin Marine Magic.'

Australia For Dolphins have launched a petition against the park - now called Dolphin Marine Magic - claiming the animals are mistreated

'The facilities are not only too small but we have strong evidence to suggest they're illegal,' said Ms Sosnowski.

Other concerns include the number of shows that dolphins at the park perform, and the level of interaction they are now required to have with visitors each day.

'I think is fairly controversial, and this occurs on a daily basis despite the legal standards stating only minimal handling is allowed,' Ms Sosnowski said. 

Troy Saville, who managed the facility for ten years when it was still the Porpoise Pool, also voiced his concerns about the treatment of the animals.

Mr Goodall has been battling to regain control of the marine centre and has plans to turn it into a hospital and rescue operation once again

'I don’t think that the animals have the same freedom as they did when we were there,' Mr Saville said, speaking of the period he ran the park alongside Mr Goodall.

'The interaction that they're doing is to my mind is probably too much.'

Mr Goodall held the same view, and while he wasn't quite as critical as Mr Saville, said despite the fact that dolphins have a 'natural affinity to become friends with humans' he believed they were 'overworked'.

'I don't agree that three shows a day is necessary, it's only necessary to make money,' Mr Goodall told Daily Mail Australia.

'(And) there's a heck of a lot more interaction than we had.'

Critics have said Bucky (right) and fellow dolphins are forced to perform three times a day to meet demand 

However the current CEO of Dolphin Marine Magic Paige Sinclair disputes these claims, saying the dolphins actually spend less time performing now than they used to.

Ms Sinclair said previous performances called 'Sea Circus Shows' run when Mr Goodall was in charge lasted for over an hour, and 'now they're only 25 minutes'.

She denied claims that dolphins were forced to give visitors 'rides' and said while more people are swimming with the dolphins there are more animals at the park than there used to be.

However CEO of Dolphin Marine Magic said the animals perform less than they used to and denied anyone rides the dolphins

The chief executive also told Daily Mail Australia that her park had already been working with the Department of Primary Industries to evaluate the measurements of the pools at the facility, as she believes she was misinformed about the size of them when she gained control.

'To blatantly lie to people ... and get 11,000 signatures on a petition is just a waste of time for everybody involved,' Ms Sinclair said.

She also revealed that she had been 'fighting this battle' since she took the reins in 2004, and while she had no bad words to say about Mr Goodall said she was 'baffled' by the fact that one of major shareholders is fighting her over the park he founded.

'I don't understand why our major shareholder is trying to cause problems, it just baffles me,' Ms Sinclair said.

There are also  concerns about the high level on interaction visitors have with the dolphins

Despite this Mr Goodall and his team are aiming to take control of the park once again and have big plans to turn the facility into a research centre and hospital for the marine life.

'We felt that the park had the ultimate potential to be a world leader in teaching people about marine animals, in rescue and rehab,' Mr Saville said, before adding he still has such aspirations if he was to regain control of the facility.

'(Right now) the park doesn't realise its potenial, it has got this very commercial ambition.'
