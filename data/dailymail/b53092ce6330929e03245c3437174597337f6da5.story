Burnley manager Sean Dyche has dismissed reports that the club are interested in signing Watford striker Troy Deeney after claiming the Clarets cannot afford his £8 million price tag.

Burnley are in need of reinforcements after returning to the Premier League following their second place finish in the Championship last season, especially since striker striker Sam Vokes has suffered a serious injury.

However, while admiring Deeney's talent, Dyche has ruled out a move for the 26-year-old who has scored 44 league goals over the past two seasons for the Hornets.

Too much! Burnley have ruled out a move for Watford striker Troy Deeney for financial reasons

'Yes. The latest one is that we will sign Deeney for £8million," 
he told Sky Sports News. 'I am not sure where they have got that from 
and I don't know what club they think we are.

'He is among many players I admire but we have a certain brief. We can't spend £8m on players, I assure you.'

Watford are thought to be holding out for a fee of £10 million after rejecting a second £7.5 million bid from Leicester while Aston Villa and QPR also interested.

Harry Redknapp is a known admirer of the prolific striker and called on Rangers owner Tony Fernandes to bring in more players after seeing his side lose 2-0 to Red Bull Leipzig in a pre-season friendly on Saturday.

‘We are 
still short, we have two strikers,’ Redknapp said. ‘We have Bobby and 
Charlie but it is taking time. Hopefully in the next week or so we can 
put that right.

‘We’re trying to get things done. You can’t go into a season with two strikers.’
