It's the snack that came back to bite one party leader – but Nigel Farage fearlessly tucked into a bacon buttie yesterday in front of photographers.

The Ukip chief was canvassing ahead of next week’s by-election in Heywood and Middleton in Greater Manchester, when his deputy leader Paul Nuttall ordered the MEP a bacon sandwich from a takeaway van.

Unlike Ed Miliband – who was subjected to widespread mockery – Mr Farage passed the test, taking sizeable mouthfuls throughout.

As he was speaking to two ladies in a takeaway van, the former stockbroker asked whether they would vote Ukip in the byelection next Thursday before Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of Ukip, ordered a bacon sarnie for the MEP.

Although the ladies said they 'didn’t really know' if they would vote next week, they joyously gave the Ukip leader a 'bacon buttie' to gorge on.

He seemed to enjoy the sandwich, laughing with the journalists and taking good-sized mouthfuls each time, though at times he was not able to make eating the sandwich look as sophisticated as he may have hoped.

The verdict was that he did much better than Ed Miliband.

But when asked whether Danish bacon would be an issue, Mr Farage replies he would be “very worried”.

It came as a Survation poll for The Sun last night showed that Labour (on 50 per cent support) is expected to win the by-election comfortably. 

Ukip is lying second with 31 per cent.
