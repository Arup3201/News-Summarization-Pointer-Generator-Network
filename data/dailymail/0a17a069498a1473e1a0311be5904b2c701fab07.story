A teenager claims he was kept as a caged sex slave by the 'three breasted hoaxer' Alisha Hessler. 

Micheal Squier, 18, said that the model - who claimed to have undergone surgery to have a third breast implanted - carved her name onto his chest on the first night they met in Tampa, Florida, with a steak knife.

The teenager claims Ms Hessler, who also goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, tied him up, flogged him and forced him to sleep in a dog's cage after they met on the internet and bonded over a shared interest in sex fetishes.

A teenager claims he was kept as a caged sex slave by the 'three breasted hoaxer' Alisha Hessler - who claims to have undergone surgery to have a third breast implanted 

Micheal Squier, 18, said that the model - who claimed to have undergone surgery to have a third breast implanted - carved her name onto his chest on the first night they met with a steak knife

He told the Sun: 'She turned me into a slave, beat me and humiliated me. I am physically scarred for life and live with the shame of what she has done to me.'

Ms Hessler claims to have spent £12,000 on surgery to have a third breast implanted, a procedure which she said was filmed for an MTV programme. 

But it soon emerged that the whole story had been a hoax, and that the third breast was merely a prostheses, designed to sit between her two natural breasts. 

She stands by her story that she underwent surgery and that the breast is a genuine implant, and says she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.  

Mr Squier claims that the pair met four months ago on social media, before he moved into her home last month. 

But he said he stayed for just two and half weeks before he fled her 'house of horrors' - which he said includes a torture room filled with sex toys, whips and chains.  

The teenager also said that she tied him to a wooden post outside her home, where she flogged him.

He also revealed that the third breast was a prosthetic, and that she removed it in front of him and stuck it on with glue each day. 

MailOnline has contacted Ms Hessler for comment. 

She told the Sun that she had kept Mr Squier as a slave, but denied ever having sex with him and said that she had never cut him - adding that he had carved her name on to his chest himself.

The only pictures of Hessler's third-breast are self-produced, and no other third-party pictures have emerged. In one YouTube clip, Tridevil's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs.

Surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues, and Tridevil made it known that she 'added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men. 

While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'.

The ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.' 

Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body.

However, Tridevil claims she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the unusual operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret.

She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements. 

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

And she has proudly declared that she been disowned by her mother and sister, who ran out the room in disgust when they saw what she had done.

'My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me,' Tridevil earlier said.
