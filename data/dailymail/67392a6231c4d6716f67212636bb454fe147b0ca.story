The latest residents of the International Space Station have arrived safety after blasting off on a Russian rocket.

A Soyuz capsule carrying American, Russian and Italian astronauts successfully docked with the International Space Station this morning, where the new crew will spend six months carrying out a variety of experiments. 

The docking took place at 2:10 am - less than six hours after the Russian spacecraft lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, which Russia leases in Kazakhstan.

In this image taken from video provided by NASA, the Soyuz TMA-09M carrying three new Expedition 36 crew members approaches the International Space Station on Wednesday morning. The cramped capsule carrying NASA's Karen Nyberg, Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin and Italy's Luca Parmitano orbited the Earth four times before docking with the space station.

This photo from NASA shows the Soyuz rocket on Expedition 36/37 carrying Soyuz Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos). Flight Engineers Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency and Karen Nyberg of NASA, were also onboard as the capsule launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station. Yurchikhin, Nyberg, and, Parmitano, will remain aboard the station until mid-November

A former Army helicopter pilot was selected in May to spend six months on board the International Space Station.

Major Tim Peake’s mission to the International Space Station will see the 41-year-old blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan in November 2015.

Major Peake is the only Briton ever to be accepted into the European Astronaut Corps.

His mission will make him the first UK national to travel and work in space, under the Union Jack, on a British Government-funded mission.

Other British astronauts have either secured private funding – such as Helen Sharman, who flew on a Russian rocket in 1991 – or taken dual citizenship, such as Michael Foale and Piers Sellers, who flew missions on the US space shuttle.

It was the fastest time a capsule has
ever taken to reach the International Space Station because the crew 
took an 'express route' shortcut and managed to reduce the journey time 
by 45 minutes.

Live footage provided by NASA TV showed it soaring into the clear night sky.

About four minutes later, the announcer said the Soyuz was traveling at 4,700 miles per hour (about 7,500 kilometers per hour). 

The cramped capsule carrying NASA's Karen Nyberg, Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin and Italy's Luca Parmitano orbited the Earth four times before docking with the space station.

After docking, the crew spent two hours 
carrying out safety checks and equalizing the air pressure between the 
capsule and the station, allowing safe entry.

The three new arrivals were greeted by 
NASA's Chris Cassidy and Russians Alexander Misurkin and the station's 
commander Pavel Vinogradov, who have been aboard the space station since
late March. 

'It was a pretty cool ride,' Nyberg said upon arrival. 

Cassidy had shaved his head to match Parmitano's look and got a thumbs-up from the Italian.

Photographers take pictures of the launch of Soyuz-FG rocket booster with Soyuz TMA-09M space ship carrying a new crew to the International Space Station. The Soyuz carrying an American, Russian and Italian blasted off Wednesday for a six-hour trip to the International Space Station, where the new crew will spend six months conducting a variety of experiments

Yurchikhin,
54, is a veteran of three previous spaceflights, while the 36-year-old 
Parmitano, a former test pilot, is making his first trip into space.

Nyberg, 43, spent two weeks in space in 2008 as part of a US space shuttle crew.

Shortly after their arrival, the incoming team spoke via video link with relatives and officials back in Baikonur.

Parmitano's mother wept throughout the chat with her son. 

Four spacewalks are planned during the expedition, including what NASA said would be the first by an Italian.

The International Space Station is the biggest orbiting outpost ever built and can sometimes be seen from Earth with the naked eye.

It consists of more than a dozen modules built by the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency.

The crew replaces the previous mission that was led by Commander Chris Hadfield.

During his mission, the Canadian astronaut regularly posted photos of life on board via Twitter, recorded video interviews and even performed a version of David Bowie's Space Oddity.

Earlier this year the first British astronaut was selected by Nasa to take part in future International Space Station missions.

A former Army helicopter pilot called Major Tim Peake was selected in May to spend six months on board the International Space Station.

Major
Peake’s mission will see the 
41-year-old blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur 
in Kazakhstan in November 2015.

Major Peake is the only Briton ever to be accepted into the European Astronaut Corps.

His
mission will make him the first UK national to travel and work in 
space, under the Union Jack, on a British Government-funded mission.

Russia's Soyuz TMA-09M spacecraft blasts off from the Russian leased Kazakh Baikonur cosmodrome on Wednesday. The crew will spend six months aboard the International Space Station with three other astronauts who have been on board since March. The crew will be carrying out various experiments into life in space

The crew on board the Soyuz TMA-09M spacecraft took an 'express route' and arrived at the International Space Station 45 minutes faster than any other mission

Other
British astronauts have either secured private funding – such as Helen 
Sharman, who flew on a Russian rocket in 1991 – or taken dual 
citizenship, such as Michael Foale and Piers Sellers, who flew missions 
on the US space shuttle.

The International Space Station mission is just one of the many missions Nasa is conducting in a bid to learn more about life in space.

In May, a Russian space capsule carrying 
animals including mice, lizards, newts and gerbils  landed back on 
Earth after spending a month in space.

The animals were subjected to various tests, during and after the trip, so 
Russian scientists could test the effects weightlessness had on 
their skeletons, nervous systems, muscles and hearts.

The
Bion-M capsule carrying the animals made the successful landing in the 
Orenburg Region, about 745 miles southeast of Moscow, but all the 
gerbils died, as did the majority of the mice and newts.
