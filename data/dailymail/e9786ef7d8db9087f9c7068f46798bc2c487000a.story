An SUV slammed into the living room of a California home on Saturday, leaving the a gaping hole in the wall and sparking a fire but not injuring the woman inside.

An unidentified 25-year-old driver is believed to have fallen asleep before he plowed his Chevrolet TrailBlazer into the side of a single-family home in Santa Ana in Orange County.

Captain Steve Concialdi of the Orange County Fire Department told KTLA that the homeowner was in another room watching college football when the SUV crashed through the house around 3:45 p.m.

The crash ignited a small fire as flames spread from the vehicle into the wood-frame home. 

The OC Register reports that 25 firefighters responded to keep the blaze from collapsing the home, which was already severely damaged in the crash.

'The vehicle is the only thing holding the roof of the building up,' said Orange County Fire Authority Captain Larry Kurtz.

Officials say they believe the driver either blacked out or fell asleep before the afternoon crash.

Emergency responders removed the man from the car and took him to UC Irvine Medical Center, about five miles away, after he complained of 'moderate' pain.

Police do not believe the driver was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash, and no charges against the driver were yet announced.

The car, however, will need to be carefully removed to avoid collapsing the home.
