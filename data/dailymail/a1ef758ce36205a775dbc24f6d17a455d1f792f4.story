From succulent roast ham to crispy meat tacos, these pictures are enough to make anyone's mouth water.

But viewers would be surprised to know these sumptuous plates of noodles and fried chicken are in fact made entirely from cake.

The deceiving sweet treats are the work of American baker, Debbie Goard, who delivers her masterpieces throughout San Francisco.

Debbie Goard started creating the life-like treats after a comedy club asked her to bake a ham cake, like this Christmas themed treat

The 45-year-old baker, who has been making cakes for 25 years, said most people can hardly believe her work when they see it.

'Virtually every cake I make starts with basic slab cakes, stacked and carved into shape, I use no shaped tins or moulds.'Â 

'People can't believe my work is a cake when they first see it, and the reaction is universally "that's a cake!?"'

Ms Goard has made over 2,000 cakes, sometimes working for as long as 57 hours to finish the creations which start at $200.

'Because these are edible I don't have the luxury of spending too much time perfecting a piece.

Ms Goard says most people are stunned when they bite into her creations which confuse the senses in their appearance, like this chicken wing and celery creation

This French bread and cheese cake is one of Ms Goard's most recent creations which she says in one of her favourites

'Early on in my business I was asked 
to make a ham cake for a comedy club, I think I surprised even myself in
how convincing it was.

'From then on the food themes have been some of my favourites.

'I
tend to dissect real foods more than look at them and I love the 
challenge of finding new ways to recreate the textures and finishes to 
make them hyper realistic.'

Creating
everything from road kill cakes to animal themed sweets, the baker said
her recipe for creating the realistic textures is top secret.

But she revealed her buffalo wing sauce is made from a combination of corn syrups and sugars which, she claims, is taken from a recipe rumoured to have been used to make blood in old Hammer horror films.

'My favourite cake is usually the latest one I've done, I so enjoy trying to improve on my own work,' she said.

'I recently made a French bread/ cheese cake; I think that I was able to really capture the different textures to create a very convincing piece.'

'I am constantly looking at my own work with a very critical eye so each successive cake, I hope to make more realistic than the last.'
