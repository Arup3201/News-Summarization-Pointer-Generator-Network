John McCain told military leaders on Tuesday that he cannot advise women to join the armed forces amid the sexual assault epidemic that has blighted the US military.

Senator McCain, who built his political career on his record as a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, made the damning comments during a Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday that addressed the widespread sexual assaults that have occurred across all branches of the US military.

The Arizona Republican said: 'Just last night, a woman came to me and said her daughter wanted to join the military and could I give my unqualified support for her doing so. I could not.

'At its core, this is an issue about 
defending basic human rights but it's also a long-term threat to the 
strength of our military. We have to ask ourselves: if left uncorrected,
what impact will this problem have on recruitment and retention of 
qualified men and women?

'I cannot overstate my disgust and 
disappointment over continued reports of sexual misconduct in our 
military. We’ve been talking about this issue for years and talk is 
insufficient.'

Military leaders admitted sexual assault in the ranks is 'like a
cancer' that could destroy the force, but 
they rejected efforts by Congress to strip commanders of some 
authority in dealing with cases. 

Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the head of each branch of the 
military testified at a packed hearing for what is viewed as 
an epidemic of sexual assault in the services.

After
recent high-profile cases, including an investigation into an alleged 
sexual assault by three Navy Academy football players, lawmakers have 
moved on legislation to address the scourge of sexual assault.

Michigan senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said the problem of sexual assault 'is of such a scope and magnitude that it has become a stain on our military'.

In previous years Congress has ensured the investigation and prosecution of sexual assaults, Mr Levin said, but more needs to be done.

The committee is considering seven bills to deal with sexual assault.

As important as additional protections would be, Mr Levin said, the problem will not be addressed successfully without a cultural change throughout the military. And that starts at the top of the chain of command.

Impact: Army General Ray Odierno says sexual assaults are destroying the military

Reforms: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand says commanders should not say if a claim goes to trial

'The military services are 
hierarchical organizations: The tone is set from the top of that chain, 
the message comes from the top, and accountability rests at the top,' Mr
Levin, who has not endorsed any of the bills, said.

The military leaders offered no disagreement about the impact on the services.

'Sexual
assault and harassment are like a cancer within the force - a cancer 
that left untreated will destroy the fabric of our force,' Army General 
Ray Odierno said. 'It's imperative that we take a comprehensive approach
to prevent attacks, to protect our people and, where appropriate, to 
prosecute wrongdoing and hold people accountable.'

While
acknowledging the problem and accepting that legislation is inevitable,
military leaders insisted that commanders keep their authority to 
handle sexual assault cases.

'Reducing command responsibility could adversely affect the ability of the commander to enforce professional standards and ultimately, to accomplish the mission,' General Dempsey told the committee.

The four-star chiefs told the committee they support Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's April recommendation to change the Uniform Code of Military Justice and mostly curtail commanding officers of the power to throw out a verdict.

The change, which is included in several of the Senate proposals, is likely to be adopted by the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday in their version of the annual defense policy bill.

But service chiefs expressed concern over making broader changes to the military's legal code that would undercut the ability of commanders to discipline troops.

General Odierno, the Army's chief of 
staff, said a commander's ability to punish quickly, visibly and at the 
unit level is essential to maintaining discipline.

'Maintaining the central role of the commander in our military justice system is absolutely critical,' he said.

One of the bills proposed by New York
senator Kirsten Gillibrand, would go the farthest by removing 
commanders from the process of deciding whether serious crimes, 
including sexual misconduct cases, go to trial.

That judgment would rest with trial counsels who have prosecution experience and hold the rank of colonel or above.

Her
legislation, which has 18 co-sponsors including four Republicans, would
take away a commander's authority to convene a court-martial. That 
responsibility would be given to offices outside the victim's chain of 
command.

Commanders would 
maintain their current authority in the legal process in cases of 
espionage, theft, sedition and conduct unbecoming an officer in her 
bill.

The Air Force's top officer, General Mark Welsh, said airmen should have no doubt about who will hold them accountable.

'Commanders having the authority to hold airmen criminally accountable for misconduct ... is crucial to building combat-ready, disciplined units,' he said.

A Pentagon report estimated that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year, up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2012, based on an anonymous survey of military personnel.

While the number of sexual assaults that members of the military reported rose 6 per cent to 3,374 in 2012, thousands of victims were still unwilling to come forward despite programs to help them.

Barbara Mikulski, a co-sponsor of the Gillibrand bill and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, called the legislation 'bold' and dismissed concerns that it goes too far in overhauling the military justice system.

'I think 26,000 sexual assaults is going too far,' Ms Mikulski said. 'And now there is even a criminal investigation of the football team at the Naval Academy, where we are training the next best.'

The Pentagon said last week that the U.S. Naval Academy is investigating allegations that three football team members sexually assaulted a female midshipman in Annapolis more than a year ago.

A lawyer for the woman claimed she was 'ostracized' on campus after reporting it.

Other recent cases include a soldier 
at the West Point Military Academy in New York being charged with 
secretly photographing women in a bathroom and the arrest of an Air 
Force officer, who led a Sexual Assault Prevention and Response unit, on
charges of groping a woman.

James
Inhofe, the top Republican on the committee, said he was wary of 
proposals to restrict the authority of commanders to discipline their 
troops.

'Fundamentally we cannot abolish sexual assault by legislation alone as you point out. Eliminating sexual assault requires commanders to drive cultural change and achieve accountability,' he said.

The power of a commander under military law to convene courts-martial and uphold or dismiss their verdicts dates back to the Articles of War adopted by the Continental Congress in 1775.

Service members were not allowed to appeal a conviction to a higher military court until much later.

That access to what Mr Hagel has described as a 'robust system of appeal rights' led to his recommendation to take away a commander's power to grant clemency in court-martial cases.

The push by members of Congress to further restrict the authority of commanders stems primarily from a case in which Air Force Lieutenant General James Franklin overturned a guilty verdict against a lieutenant colonel convicted on charges of abusive sexual contact and aggravated sexual assault.

In cautioning against making significant changes to military law without careful consideration,General Welsh told the committee that complete reversals of court-martial findings in Air Force sexual assault cases were rare.

Lieutenant General Franklin's decision is the only one out of 327 cases over the past five years, he said.
