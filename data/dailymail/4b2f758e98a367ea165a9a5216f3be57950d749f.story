A pair of adorable albino squirrels have been spotted playing up a tree in a park by a family returning from the nursery.

Steve and Tammi Ashley were walking through the Jubilee Park in Waterlooville with their daughters Isabel, four and Neve, two, when they spotted the rare creatures.

According to Mr Ashley, the two small squirrels were playing in a tree while under the protection of their white squirrel mother.

The squirrels, nicknamed Pinky and Perky are believed to be the only pair of albino squirrel siblings in Britain.

Mr Ashley, 34, said: 'All of a 
sudden I saw a flash of white in the tree. I looked up and thought I saw
 a cuddly toy - it was white and fluffy.

'Then
 I realised it was a squirrel and another all white one bounded round 
the branch. It was brilliant, my daughters were absolutely delighted.

'My
 youngest kept asking for a kiss, and Isabel asked if she could have 
one. I’ve never seen an albino squirrel before, let alone two.'

The family have been returning to the tree to see whether they can spot the squirrels again.

Mr Ashley said: 'They were hugging, it was absolutely adorable.

'The squirrels are obviously quite young, because their mum was sat on a branch higher up, keeping an eye on them.

'We decided to name them Pinky and Perky because you can really see their red eyes against their white fur.'

While the family were watching the squirrel show, one of the albino rodents decided to go for a run across the grass

Pinky and Perky face an uncertain future as their bright coats mean they are highly visible to predators

Unfortunately, Pinky and Perky's future looks quite bleak as their unusual colour means they can be easily spotted by predators.

Squirrels have about a one in 100,000 chance of being born albinism. As well as the white hair and white skin, albino squirrels have red eyes. They also suffer from vision problems.

Ordinarily, squirrels remain with their mothers until they reach about four months old before making their own way into the wild.

Earlier this month, Lady Sarah Gough, 75, thought she’d seen a ghost when she heard mysterious scratching at a window in her home in Sevenoaks, Kent, only to discover it was an albino squirrel.
