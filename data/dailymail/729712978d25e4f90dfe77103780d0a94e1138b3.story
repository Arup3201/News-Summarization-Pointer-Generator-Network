Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has stars in his eyes on the front page of Marca on Saturday in the form of Lionel Messi and Diego Simeone.

The Spanish paper says ‘Look what’s coming!’ in their headline as they outline two major challenges ahead for the Real manager.

‘The height of rivalry: Ancelotti’s Madrid play for La Liga and the Champions League inside a month against Messi’s Barca and Cholo’s Atletico.’

Ancelotti's job is believed to be under pressure and the high-profile fixtures he faces could decide his future

It’s as tough as it gets in Spain as they face a rampant Barcelona on Sunday as they look to peg back the point they trail their great rivals by before next month’s clash with Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter finals.

AS also focus on the European tie of the round between last year's finalists, looking at Real's determination to make up for their poor record against Atleti this season while the underdogs seek redemption from last year's final.

Real have yet to win a game against Atletico this season despite playing them six times, with the most recent result being a 4-0 triumph for their city rivals.

In Italy, almost every major club - bar Juventus - seem to be in some sort of crisis, if you believe their front pages.

While La Gazzetta dello Sport looks forward to Juve's favourable draw against Monaco in the Champions League quarter-finals with the headline: 'Juve Grand Prix', Corriere dello Sport focus on how AC Milan will be 'left on its own' ahead of a planned fan walkout against Cagliari at the San Siro.
