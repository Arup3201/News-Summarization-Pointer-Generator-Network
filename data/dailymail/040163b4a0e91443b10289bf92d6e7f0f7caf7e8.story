Television presenter Chris Tarrant has described the high-profile arrests of 70s celebrities in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal as a 'witch-hunt'.

The 67-year-old, who recently announced he was stepping down from long-running TV quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, said while those found by a court to be 'like Savile' should be locked up, he also warned about innocent people getting hurt.

Tarrant last year joined a number of people who criticised Jimmy Savile, saying: 'I met him twice and found him deeply unpleasant. God knows why none of it came out before.'

Asked about how he felt about the arrests of 70s entertainers following the Savile investigation, Tarrant has now told The Telegraph: 'I think what is happening is terrifying, it does appear to be a witch-hunt.

'Those like Savile, who behaved about as vilely as a human being can, deserve to be banged up and have the key thrown away.

'But in the meantime there are an awful lot of people who are getting hurt, some of whom are clearly innocent.'

Last week Paul Gambaccini admitted he was the latest celebrity to be arrested by detectives investigating the Savile scandal.

The 64-year-old radio and TV presenter issued a statement denying the ‘historic’ allegations of sexual abuse after frenzied speculation about the identity of the high-profile suspect arrested earlier in the week.

Detectives did not disclose details of the allegations facing Gambaccini. But it indicated in a statement that he is not suspected of committing offences with paedophile Savile.

Operation Yewtree is the national investigation prompted after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile.

Scotland Yard has led the probe, and separated its inquiries into those involving Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving others.

Entertainer Rolf Harris, former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and PR consultant Max Clifford are among the high profile figures already arrested and charged with sex offences following Operation Yewtree. They all deny wrongdoing.

Comedian Jim Davidson, who was arrested in January, learned in the summer that he would not be charged.

Fellow entertainer Freddie Starr remains on police bail, as prosecutors decide whether to charge him. Former pop star Gary Glitter is also waiting to learn his fate after his arrest.

Gambaccini was the 15th suspect to be arrested under Operation Yewtree. Police confirmed another man, aged 74, was arrested as part of the investigation. Both men have been bailed to a date in early January.

After making his name on Tiswas, Tarrant went on to host a number of shows including OTT and Tarrant on TV.

He also joined Capital Radio as a presenter in 1984 and hosted Capital Breakfast from 1987 to 2004.

In 1998 he hosted the hugely popular Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, the most internationally popular television franchise of all time after being aired in more than 100 countries.

Last month however Tarrant announced he had reached a point where he wanted to call it a day after being with the show since its inception.

In the interview with The Telegraph, Tarrant also spoke about his father, who was awarded a Military Cross for his role in the Second World War.

The TV presenter is planning to release a book in May called Dad's War, which details how he discovered that his father had been involved in some of the war's most significant campaigns,  including the Dunkirk evacuation and the D-Day landings, and also took part in some of the most brutal, close-range fighting in Cleve.
