John Balyo, 35, (pictured at his arrest last week) a former DJ for Christian station WCSG, was charged with having sex with a minor. FBI revealed today they found his storage unit containing handcuffs and duct tape

A Christian radio host has admitted to raping a 12-year-old boy, a prosecutors said on Monday.

John Balyo, 35, was arrested last Friday while at the Big Ticket Christian music festival in Gaylord, Michigan. He was a morning show host on Christian station WCSG.

The 35-year-old admitted to raping the child, a Calhoun County prosecutor said at Balyo's arraignment on Monday.

The accused, of Caledonia, Michigan, was denied bail after being charged with first- and second-degree criminal sexual conduct.  He is now facing the rest of his life in prison.

Balyo got married in April and has a stepson, according to the Christian Post.

According to Mlive.com, prosecutor
 David Gilbert said Balyo admitted to 'some' charges which police said 
related to a single incident at a home in Battle Creek on May 17.

The
 DJ allegedly paid resident Ronald Moser, 41, to have sex with a young boy. Authorities who raided Moser's property on June 5 found him at the home with a 12-year-old boy.

According to mlive.com, in a photo album allegedly posted online by Moser, there were ten images of a young boy lying face down on a bed.

His hands and feet were bound and he was wearing only underwear, which had been rolled up to show his buttocks, according to a federal agent.

The albums had titles such as 'very cute boy,' and 'sexy boys', police said.

The FBI said Moser put images online and planned to trade in child 
porn.  It is alleged that Moser ran a website providing sex with underage boys for money.

The investigation into the alleged pedophiles has involved multiple agencies as part of a larger 'Operation Predator'. 

Balyo was fired from his job at WCSG and the station publicly asked for prayers for the former host, his family and alleged victims.

The 35-year-old had been at the radio station for eight years.

In a statement, WCSG said: 'We sincerely grieve over these recent
 events, in particular the tragic impact on victims and their parents. 
The trafficking and exploitation of minors is absolutely deplorable.

'The WCSG family is deeply aching and know you may be hurting as well.'

A spokesman added: 'We know that no one, absolutely no one, 
is immune from falling into the darkness of sin. And yet, we have hope. 
Those who truly follow and live for Jesus Christ know He alone has the 
power to restore broken lives and broken trust.'

Balyo is due back in court on July 7 and faces trial on August 18.
