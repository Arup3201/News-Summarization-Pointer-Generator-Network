Tory donors have threatened to switch their allegiance to UKIP unless David Cameron adopts a tougher stance on Europe.

In yet another blow to his leadership, former Tory treasurer Lord Kalms said he was ‘willing to pack my bags’ and sign up with UKIP unless the Prime Minister adopted more traditional Tory policies.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage is set to seize on discontent among Tory MPs and UKIP’s recent success in the polls with a fund-raising appeal.

Leaving: Senior Torys have said that they are willing to 'pack their bags' and leave for UKIP if the Conservatives don't change their policy

He has been invited by City financier Crispin Odey to pitch to wealthy donors for support.

Lord Kalms, the Dixons tycoon, is one of the most likely to start bankrolling UKIP.

He said Mr Farage was ‘very, very attractive’ and a ‘first-rate guy,’ adding: ‘UKIP deserve all the support they get.’

He told the Sunday Times: ‘I have always been a Conservative but that loyalty is wearing very, very thin.’

‘If UKIP has the right policies, that’s where we’ll go. I am very, very disenchanted and won’t tolerate being dragged down into Europe without some fight.’

Defecting: Nigel Farage revealed that at least one Conservative MP has used a go-between to discuss switching to UKIP

He urged the PM to stop trying ‘to be all things to all men - that means you are nothing to nobody’.

Lord Kalms was stripped of the Tory whip after he said he would lend his vote to UKIP in 2009.

But last year, he donated £5000 to the Conservatives in Harlow, Essex. He and his wife Lady Pamela, have given the Tories £761,287 since 2001.

Three of the most generous donors to the Conservatives have reportedly complained about the PM’s emphasis on gay marriage.

Separately, one former Tory donor Andy Brough, has joined UKIP.

Backing from more heavyweight donors will be welcomed by UKIP after one of its recent bankrollers, Demetri Marchessini, was criticised for writing a book telling women to stop wearing trousers.

A boost in financial support is likely to follow UKIP’s recent success in the local elections, where it won 23 per cent of the vote. It is also on course to come first in the European elections next year.

But the rising profile of the party recently led to a bitter confrontation with protesters in Edinburgh which left the party leader shaken. Mr Farage was forced to barricade himself into a pub after angry Scots turned on him, calling him a ‘racist scumbag’.

Mr Farage has revealed he has now had to rethink his security situation and hired bodyguards. ‘I have to think about security for the first time ever, I’m afraid. Horrible,’ he said.

He added,’ What I’ve done for the last 15 years is to book halls all over the country... and just turn up, park outside, bowl in, do my bit, meet the people afterwards. Sadly that’s going to change.’

A summit to discuss an electoral pact with UKIP is also being planned by the Bow Group - whose president is Sir John Major - and the Conservative Grassroots [corr] body of local parties.

The event, Deal or No Deal, is being held in the Commons on June 24.

Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP who was only given back the whip this month after an unauthorised absence from parliament to perform in a reality TV show, reiterated plans for MPs to seek endorsement from UKIP.

She told Sky’s Murnaghan: ‘It almost seems a nonsense where you have two people who think and have the same values standing against each other.’

Values: Nadine Dorries reiterated plans for MPs to seek endorsement from UKIP as they have the same values

She added ‘Every Conservative MP has to be adopted by their Conservative association and then they could seek endorsement from UKIP with a double logo. After all, we have just recently voted to change the law to allow that to happen.’

In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Farage revealed that UKIP was speaking to ‘about 20’ Tory MPs about standing on a joint ticket.

He also cited two Labour MPs - Kate Hoey and Gisela Stewart - who the party would not stand against as they were considered ‘friends’ in the Eurosceptic movement.

He is also in talks with Tory councillors who want to defect, while one Tory MP had been in touch with a go-between but Mr Farage had vetoed him after taking one look at his voting record and deciding, ‘no, no way’.
