A mother of three has described the heartbreaking last moment she saw her children before her husband murdered them and threw himself off a cliff.

Ruth Fuller, 34, told husband Ceri, 35, she was leaving him because of a ‘schoolgirl crush’ on a university lecturer.

She asked him to give her space while she packed by taking their children Sam, 12, Rebecca, eight, and Charlotte, seven, on a drive away from their home in Milkwall in Gloucestershire, an inquest heard.

Ceri Fuller, pictured on his wedding day to Ruth, was found dead at the foot of the 60ft cliff and his children (l - r) Rebecca, eight, Charlotte, seven and Sam, 12, suffered stab wounds to their necks, an inquest heard

She heard a car door slam but it was 
only much later, when she saw her son’s treasured mobile was left 
behind, that she knew ‘something horrible had happened’, she said.

In fact, her husband had taken the 
children to a secluded beauty spot in Shropshire, where he stabbed them 
to death with a 6.5inch hunting knife before killing himself.

Fuller's fingerprint was found on a hunting knife near the children's bodies

‘I was up early on the Thursday and I 
was telling him I was going soon,’ Mrs Fuller said. ‘I was trying to 
pack a bag. I said, “take the kids for a drive and I will tidy up the 
house”.

‘That was the last time I saw Ceri. All I remember is hearing the car door shut.’

Unaware of the impending tragedy, Mrs 
Fuller left the house and continued to send ‘flirty’ texts to tutor Mark
Lindley-Highfield, 38. She told the hearing the first sign something 
was wrong came when the children’s school called. ‘School rang to ask 
where the kids were and I said they were sick. They had been sick 
recently.’

Mrs Fuller became increasingly worried about where her husband had gone.

‘By this point I was with mum and I was panicking. I realised I didn’t know if the children were at home or at school.

‘I had walked around and looked in their duvets before I left and not seen them.

‘I went home with my dad and there was Ceri’s phone and there was also Sam’s phone, which was unusual,’ she said.

‘At this point, I knew something horrible had happened but I couldn’t admit [it] to myself or mum or dad.’

Distraught, Mrs Fuller attempted to 
kill herself with a kitchen knife, but was held back by her father, the 
inquest heard.

She said: ‘My head was completely broken. I didn’t know 
where the children were and I didn’t know what that meant.

‘I just panicked and ended up having a mental breakdown. I cannot believe he did something so hateful and cruel.’

The children were found dead at a disused quarry in Poles Coppice and Fuller's Land Rover was parked nearby

Ceri Fuller, 35, was found at the bottom of the 60ft cliff in Pontesbury Hill, Shropshire, in July last year

Ruth Fuller said she could not believe her husband Ceri had done something 'so hateful and cruel'

The inquest yesterday found the 
children were unlawfully killed by their father, who then took his own 
life. Andrew Barkley, deputy coroner for Shropshire, called it ‘a scene
of unimaginable horror’.

Ruth Fuller's father Ron Tocknell told the inquest she had appeared 'very disturbed' in the days leading up to her children's deaths

The couple met at university and 
married in 2009, the inquest heard. ‘Possessive’ Fuller, a paper-mill 
worker, once threatened to strangle his wife with a phone cord, and also
allegedly hit one of the children.

Mrs Fuller, an artist, described her  
husband’s tears last July when she admitted her feelings for Mr 
Lindley-Highfield, whom she met at her Open University course.

‘I had admitted I thought he was 
attractive and Ceri didn’t like that,’ she said in a statement read out 
in court. ‘Later he stood in front of me crying, holding his wedding 
ring, and asked me if he should take it with him.

‘I think Ceri was feeling neglected. He used to insist on driving me to and picking me up from my tutorials.

‘I think it was his way of making sure
I came straight home. It was difficult for Ceri to see me becoming more
intelligent, happier and interacting with other people because he was 
so possessive.’

The children’s bodies were found in 
woods near a disused quarry in Poles Coppice near Shrewsbury, four days 
after they went missing on July 12 last year.

Fuller dumped their bodies before 
jumping from a 60ft cliff. Sam died from a single neck wound and his two
sisters suffered multiple stab injuries, some to the chest.

Mr Barkley added: ‘What happened in the coppice that night might never be known.

‘It was a scene of unimaginable horror, the kind of things nightmares are made of.’
