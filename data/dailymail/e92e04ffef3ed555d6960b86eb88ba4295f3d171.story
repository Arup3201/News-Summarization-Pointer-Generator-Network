Confirmation that I had begun what we used to know as 'the change of life' came as no shock to me whatsoever. Actually, it was a huge relief.

I was in my mid-40s and had been experiencing the usual symptoms: unpredictable periods, feeling a bit low, and the occasional hot flush and night sweat.

My wonderful GP did a blood test, confirmed my suspicions, asked whether I wanted Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) pills or patches. And that was that. My childbearing days were over.

The menopause years have been 'the most rewarding of my life'

Believe it or not, I welcomed it. With two sons then in their teens, I had no desire for more children.

Having spent half my life trying to control my fertility - first to avoid being an unmarried mother, then to prevent expansion of my family which I saw as large enough - the menopause was, frankly, very welcome.

And while some women regard ageing and the loss of their fertility as depressing, I have never been one to fuss about growing older and, hopefully, wiser.

That is why I read reports last week from the biologist Dr Aarathi Prasad - arguing that the menopause may soon become a thing of the past, with women 'evolving' out of it - with absolute horror.

Dr Prasad says the menopause dates from a time when generations of women were competing over scarce resources, and it was not ideal for them all to bear children at the same time.

Now, in an age when resources are 
plentiful, life expectancies are longer and women remain healthier at a 
greater age, she says the menopause is not necessary and women could 
soon bear children in their 50s and beyond.

Heaven forbid. While medical science and the cosmetics industry constantly chase the dream of eternal youth, please could our fertility cycle be left to run its natural course?

Menopause is a natural rite of passage, as rich as any other in a woman's life. A good thing, not to be dreaded or avoided, but to be met with courage and a sense of adventure.

This is that moment when you realise you no longer have to worry about getting pregnant or nurturing needy small children; that you have moved into a freer stage of life where your time is more often your own. And believe me, that moment is truly liberating.

Some of the most beautiful and effective women I know are in their 60s, 70s or even their 80s. Helen Mirren, Judi Dench and Joan Bakewell to name but three.

I was deeply touched when I once asked the politician and academic Baroness Shirley Williams about the anxiety so many women feel about losing their fertility as they grow older.

She said: 'Getting older in public life is so secondary. If you see yourself only as a sexual, reproductive being, I'm sure it's hard if that part of life is behind you. But for me, even as a mother, it was only one part. I've always been valued, and valued myself, for other things.'

Her wisdom is a lesson to us all, and one I have tried wholeheartedly to embrace.

We should not be ashamed of growing old: we should embrace our wrinkles and be engaged with and admired for everything we've learned in our lives.

As soon as I had my diagnosis, I took my doctors' advice and popped the HRT pills. My mother had a terrible time at around the same age and had taken HRT for 20 years with heartening results, so I followed her lead.

I was told it would help sustain my energy and assist in stemming the loss of collagen in my skin. This way, my face would remain fresh, my hair thick and glossy, and I would not be plagued by hot flushes during a broadcast.

The different ways in which women react to the menopause is a subject I am deeply interested in, and prompted me to write my book, Is It Me Or Is It Hot in Here? - A Modern Woman's Guide To The Menopause, ten years ago.

'Menopause is a natural rite of 
passage, as rich as any other in a woman's life. A good thing, not to be
dreaded or avoided, but to be met with courage and a sense of 
adventure.'

In the introduction I pointed out how, given today's life spans, many women will be post-menopausal for a third of their lives.

As we bring up our children so much later, we have to deal with that explosive hormonal cocktail; the menopausal woman and the teenage son or daughter.

We also have to decide whether we want to go along with science that keeps us young, either through pills or the surgeon's knife.

We can grow old disgracefully with hair dye as our constant companion, or be graceful and grey in the distinguished manner once only available to men.

For some of the women I spoke to during my research, the menopause was a distressing time. Hot flushes and heavy periods are hardly pleasant experiences. But it rarely lasts long and there's no evidence to say the menopause has a damaging effect on a woman's brainpower.

I remember the actress Julie Walters appearing on a television show to discuss her role as the dance teacher in the film of Billy Elliot. Julie and I are the same age, 63, and it was so refreshing to hear her laugh about her hot flushes during the dance routines.

By this time I was on HRT, which stopped the flushes and night sweats. But after ten years of taking it, I developed breast cancer  - something I firmly believe would not have happened had I let the menopause pass naturally.

Is It Me or Is It Hot in Here? 'Fans, darling, fans,' Katie Boyle once said. 'Always carry an elegant one.'

If I had my time again, I would embrace the changes and welcome the freedom heralded by the absence of periods. I'd do my best to protect my heart with regular exercise and not smoking.

And I'd take the advice given to the former newsreader, Angela Rippon, by Katie Boyle, one of the television stars of the Sixties and Seventies. When asked if she had ever taken HRT, Katie replied: 'No, darling. Fans, darling, fans. Always carry an elegant one.'

I've now been post-menopausal for nearly 20 years and I can truly say they've been the most rewarding of my life.

I've seen my boys grow into smashing young men, accompanied my parents through the ends of their lives, dealt with a life-threatening disease and loved every minute of working harder than ever and having more time to spend with friends.

Another argument Prasad used to bolster her theory that the menopause was obsolete in the modern world was the 'grandmother hypothesis'.

Hormone replacement therapy tablets: Many experiencing menopause use them to ease the effects of menopause

This makes the assumption that the menopause evolved in tribal cultures, because it creates a generation of child-free older women who can help the fertile childbearers look after the families: the maternal grandmother becomes the key person responsible for raising, but not bearing, children.

But in the West, Dr Prasad argues, that system no longer prevails. Instead, older women are increasingly healthy and able to raise their own young families. 

However, the idea that the role of grandparents is now obsolete simply isn't borne out by evidence.

Didn't research published last week by Grandparents Plus and Age UK reveal that the nation's grandparents save families £7.3 billion a year by taking on childcare for their working sons and daughters?

The older generation cares for 1.6 million children, and the hours they put in have risen to 1.7 billion - a 35 per cent rise since 2004.

So it seems the 'grandmother hypothesis' is actually a perfect fit for Western economies, where both parents often need to work but can't afford paid childcare.

Post-menopausal women have a vital place in the world and should feel no need to compete with young women of childbearing age.

I hope Dr Prasad's vision is wrong. A world where the menopause has died out to allow more babies to be born to women aged 50-plus is not one I'd ever welcome.

Evolution should stand still on that score and the menopause should stay as it is - a valuable midlife experience beyond which women can enjoy new freedoms.
