It's a death defying craze favoured by daredevil 'rooftoppers' aiming to take photography to new heights.

But it seems that 'skywalking' - the dangerous art of scaling tall buildings or cranes to take a picture from a vertigo inducing perspective while sometimes performing tricks and stunts in the process - is nothing new.

These stunning images, taken from the archives at the Boston Public Library, show that brave souls were foolishly frolicking around at dizzying heights in the 1930s.

The most striking of the images shows one New York steeplejack showing a complete disregard for his own personal safety and performing a pretty risky handstand while on top of the Statue of Liberty.

Another picture shows the worker clinging on to the tablet that Lady Liberty clutches in her left hand seemingly completely oblivious to the dizzying drop below.

The steeplejack, whose footprints can be seen on the statue's crown in the picture, was working on its restoration in 1938.

Other photographs show men climbing to the very top of the Woolwich Building in New York, and a worker carving part of George Washington's face into the rock at Mount Rushmore.

The photographs were taken between 1917 and 1934.

A later image, taken from 1964 shows that British men had an equally good head for heights. The picture shows two workers fitting lights to the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Somerset.

Like today's 'skywalkers', the men in the photographs balance hundreds of feet up in the air with little or no safety equipment.

But unlike today's daredevils, the men photographed in the early decades of the 20th century weren't there out of choice.

With little attention given to health and safety regulations, the men were expected to climb to the top of some of our most recognisable buildings every day to carry out routine maintenance, cleaning or building work.
