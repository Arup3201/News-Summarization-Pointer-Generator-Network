A 19-year-old Vogue model has appeared in court after allegedly stealing three chocolate bars from a shop in New York.

Roosmarijn de Kok was stopped as she left Whole Foods in Tribeca, Manhattan, on July 18 with three chocolates and bottle of fish oil in her bag which she had not paid for.

She was arrested after a store detective spotted the alleged shoplifting incident and grabbed her before she left.

The Vogue model was stopped by a store detective as she left the shop in Tribeca, Manhattan on July 18

The security worker then 'recovered the items, property which belonged to the store and for which the defendant had no receipt, from the bag,' the New York Post reported.

De Kok, who has previously appeared in Vogue Thailand and has modelled for Urban Outfitters, was charged with misdemeanor petty larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree.

The Dutch model was also told off by a judge at Manhattan Criminal Court for folding her arms during the hearing yesterday, in which she was wearing Saint Laurent.

Her lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, said de Kok forgot she had the chocolates in her bag after buying fat-free yogurt and protein bars from the health food shop.

De Kok's lawyer Sal Strazzullo says the Dutch beauty queen is 'totally innocent' and tried to give back the goods

'While she was about to leave the store … she remembered what she had in her bag. When she turned around, the store detectives were like: "We got you"' he said.

'The complaint states that she attempted to leave — it doesn't state that she did leave. She's totally innocent.'

Prosecutors offered de Kok an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal (ACD), meaning the charges would be dropped if the beauty queen stays out of trouble for a period of time.

But Mr Strazzullo said: 'I don't think she should even have to take an ACD when she didn't do anything wrong.' 

The case continues.
