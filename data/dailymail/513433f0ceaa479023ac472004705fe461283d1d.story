It's fair to say Robin van Persie hasn't scored quite as many goals as he would have liked over the last few months. Maybe he could learn a thing or two from this man... Hristo Stoichkov.

Van Persie bumped into the former Bulgarian footballer while on international duty with Holland, and took a picture for his 6.5 million Twitter followers, alongside the message 'Was very nice to meet Hristo Stoichkov today. Legend!'

Stoichkov is most famous for his 151 appearances in a Barcelona shirt, where he scored 77 goals, and in 2004 he was voted in Pele's list of the 125 greatest living footballers.

Stoichkov scored 38 goals in 84 caps for the Bulgarian national team

The Bulgarian divided football fans during his playing career - he was loved by some but denounced by others, once claiming 'No Bulgarian will ever match my achievements.'

A bold statement, but perhaps one that will ring true.

The pair were in good spirits as they smiled for the photo, and Manchester United fans will be hoping Stoichkov left their striker with a few words of inspiration.
