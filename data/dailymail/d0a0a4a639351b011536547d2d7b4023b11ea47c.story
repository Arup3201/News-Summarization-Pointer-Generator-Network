The husband of the woman named as Fifa president Sepp Blatter's new love today said he had no idea the pair had been romantically linked in press reports.

Unfounded rumours have been circulating after mother-of-two Linda Barras, 49, was pictured arriving with Blatter, 77, at an awards ceremony last week.

When asked about his wife's relationship with Blatter, Christian Barras said he was unaware of the incredible stories circulating in the Swiss press.

Mr Barras, who owns an estate agency in Switzerland, said: 'I know nothing about this. I’m still married to Linda.

'I know that she went to the ceremony. She is a friend of the niece of Sepp Blatter.' 

The brunette, dressed all in black, was seen laughing and joking with Blatter at the Fifa Ballon d’Or gala last Monday night in Zurich, Switzerland.

On her other side was Brazilian footballing legend Pele.

Linda and her husband, who married in 1998 and have two daughters, have known Blatter for several years.

In 2008 the Fifa boss attended La Nuit Des Neiges, a Swiss charity gala event of which Linda was president up until last summer.

The gala evening takes place every February and is in aid of a local and international charity.

It was founded by Linda’s brother-in-law Francois Barras and it was at one of the events that Linda met Christian. She was later asked to become president.

Swiss tabloid newspaper Blick has run a number of articles claiming Linda is Blatter’s new love.

The first article read: 'Blatter's New Love is 28 years younger.'

It continued: 'For almost six years Sepp Blatter has been single. Now the FIFA boss is again in a happy relationship.'

According to the publication, Blatter was also spotted at Zurich airport 'sometime ago' waiting for Mrs Barras.

It read: 'Sometime ago at Zurich airport he (Blatter) sat expectantly in the hall, his driver stayed with the car.

'A photographer discovered the FIFA boss and asked if he was waiting for a well-known football player.

'Blatter then smiled mysteriously - and only replied that he was waiting on someone from the heart.

'A little later an attractive, dark-haired woman took her place in Blatter's sedan - Linda Barras.'

When questioned about his aunt’s 
relationship with Blatter, the grown-up son of Francois said: 'To the 
last of my knowledge I think they (Christian and Linda) are still 
together.

'I think it’s just
 a big misunderstanding what happened and a big mistake on Linda’s part 
in some ways. Yes, they are still together.

'I don’t think she is Sepp Blatter’s new girlfriend at all. She is a friend of Sepp’s. Sepp is a friend of the family.'

Blatter,
 dubbed The Most Powerful Man in Football, has been married three times 
and has one daughter, Corinne, who is mum to his granddaughter, Serena.

He was born in Visp, Switzerland, and has been president of Fifa since 1998.

One of Blatter’s ex-wives, Graziella Blatter-Bianca, said she was 'delighted' he had apparently found a new love.

She said: 'I am very happy for him.

'We
 are still in good contact. I don’t know Linda but I am delighted if he 
has found a new love. Who knows, maybe there is life after Fifa. And 
it’s good for him if he has someone at his side.'

Graziella, who is a life coach, married Blatter in 2002. They separated after less than a year.

She said being married to such a powerful man was not always easy.

She said: 'Of course, you need a lot of understanding and patience. He travels a lot and has to tackle a huge workload. I admire that and think he does a very good job. His work is his calling.'

Fifa refused to comment about the latest allegations surrounding the controversial boss.

A spokeswoman said: 'The president says it's a private matter. It's a personal thing.

'The person accompanying him (to the Ballon d’Or) was a guest of honour. It was his personal guest.'

Linda and Blatter were pictured at The Fifa Ballon d’Or, an annual football award given to the player considered to have performed the best in the previous year.

This year’s winner was Cristiano Ronaldo.
