Festive fun: The crimson-crew spread Christmas cheer by handing out gifts and singing Christmas carols

Ho Ho Ho: Organisers of the London event describe it as 'non-profit, non political, non religious and non sensical Christmas parade'

The holiday themed revelry now takes place in  300 cities around the world, including New York, Vancouver, and Moscow.

The first SantaCon took place in San Francisco in 1994. 

The New York parade is said to be the largest with around 30,000 Santas taking part. 

The crimson-crew  spread Christmas cheer in London by handing out gifts and singing Christmas carols.

Among the mob of red suites and white beards were the odd elf, Christmas tree and even a reindeer. 

Event organisers describe it as 'a non-proﬁt, non-political, non-religious and nonsensical Christmas parade takes place in London one Saturday every December.'

They said: 'There’s no particular reason to dress up in Santa suits, run around, give gifts, sing songs, have strangers sit on our laps and decide who is naughty or nice. But it’s a lot of fun so Santa does it anyway.'

This train load of participants were keeping to the rules of the event by donning their Christmas apparel

The festive parade took in a selection of London landmarks, as well as a number of bars and pubs

The Santas set off at three different meeting points across the north, east and south of the capital before converging into one big festive parade.

The route included Oxford Street, Covent Garden, Hyde Park Corner and Brick Lane. 

Ahead of the event participants were advised of two rules  - Christmas apparel was mandatory and they must not turn into a bad santa.
