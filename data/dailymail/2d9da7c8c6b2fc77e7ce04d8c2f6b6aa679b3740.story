The 2014 Archibald Prize was awarded to Sydney artist Fiona Lowry on Friday for her mesmerising painting of architect Penelope Seidler.

Ms Lowry was one of 54 finalists in the portrait competition who was finally chosen for the $75,000 prize at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

She said she was inspired by the very subject of her winning portrait upon first seeing Ms Seidler at a gallery opening six years ago.

'I was really struck by her beauty and her presence and asked someone who she was. I decided then that I would like to paint her,' Lowry said.

'It is important to me when I am making a work that I take the subject to a place that has memory and history attached to it because I am interested in exploring the subject's interaction with that landscape.'

The portrait, painted with an airbrush and using only a limited palette of soft, pastel colours, is set at the back of Ms Seidler's iconic Killara house, which she designed along with her late husband Harry Seidler in the 1960s.

'It's an incredible space architecturally but it is also loaded with history and memories of life very well lived.

Both Ms Lowry and Ms Seidler attended the event at the Gallery of New South Wales where the winner was announced on Friday

The painting was set in Ms Seidler's backyard and captures the moment that Ms Seidler reflects on a certain view of her home from her backyard

'We spent some time in the bush at the back of the property looking at the waterfall.

'At one point, Penelope looked back at the house towering over us and reflected that it had been some time since she had seen it from this angle. It was that reflection that I wanted to explore with this portrait.'

The president of the board of trustees, Guido Belgiorno-Nettis, who lead the judging process, told the Daily Mail Australia that Ms Lowry was a clear winner from both a technical and and emotional point of view.

'Firstly it's an extraordinary interpretation of Penelope Seidler. Quite a few of us know her as trustees, so we were able to see that quality that she was able to capture,' Mr Belgiorno-Nettis said.

'It is a very penetrating look â€“ a reflective, deep, intense look on her face that I think Fiona was just brilliantly able to capture with her technique of using an airbrush.

'We thought this was an absolutely stand outstanding portrait.'

This is the third time Ms Lowry has been a finalist in the Archibald Prize, coming a close second in last year's competition.

This year she was also a finalist for the Sulman Prize.
