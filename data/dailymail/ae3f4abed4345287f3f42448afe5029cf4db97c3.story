A Romanian migrant who was greeted by Keith Vaz as he arrived in Britain to work is a convicted thug who beat up his girlfriend and threatened to drown her in a lake, it was claimed today.

Victor Spirescu, 30, was treated to Costa Coffee by the Labour MP when he landed in England on New Year's Day after labour market restrictions were relaxed.

He insisted he was here to work and not 'rob your country' when he arrived and is now washing cars outside Aldi in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire.

It was claimed today that he was found guilty of violence in June 2011 and fined for attacking his girlfriend in Bucharest, The Sun reported.

The woman - identified as 26-year-old Ana - said that he punched her to the floor in a park and then hit her repeatedly when she was on the ground. She also claimed he threatened to drown her in a lake.

She told James Beal and Chris Pollard at The Sun that she split up with Spirescu because he had failed to get a job.

Speaking about the attack, she told the newspaper: 'He had never been violent to me before - but in the last couple of months he did not understand that he needed to do something with his life.'

The pair began dating in 2009 but she split up with him seven months later.

Migrant: Spirescu attacked his ex-girlfriend in January 2010 and was fined by a court, it was claimed today

She eventually agreed to meet up with him again in a park in January 2010 after he had tried to contact her up to 40 times. When they met up, she said he launched his attack.

It was reported that Spirescu was fined Â£600 and ordered to pay his ex-girlfriend Â£400 compensation in June 2011 by Bucharest's 3rd District Court following the incident. In addition, he was given a 35 day suspended jail sentence.

Ana claims that she has not received a penny of the payout that the court said she should receive.

Spirescu's mother told The Sun that he was not a violent person.

The Romanian has since moved on and has a 19-year-old fiancee he has left on the small, rundown holding they own in a  village in Transylvania.

Each day, Catalina Curcean chops enough wood to burn so she can stay warm in temperatures as low as minus 25c. There is no running water in the Â£2,000 property.

Mr Spirescu could not be reached for comment today about claims he attacked his ex-girlfriend.

Keith Vaz said he was not aware of the Romanian migrant's background when he met him at Luton Airport on New Year's Day.

'Members of the Home Affairs Select Committee visited Luton on January 1 to look at the preparations at the border for the raising of transitional controls,' he said.

'It is impossible to check the life histories of everyone we meet on our visits.'
