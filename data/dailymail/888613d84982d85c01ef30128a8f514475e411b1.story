Fury: Lord Dannatt has been criticised for citing fallen soldiers to argue against independence

Military veterans have hit back at the suggestion that voting for Scottish independence is disrespectful to dead soldiers after a former head of the Army sparked a political row by urging a No vote in Thursday's referendum.

Lord Dannatt said yesterday that if Scotland left the UK it would be 'letting down' Scottish soldiers who died fighting in Northern Ireland.

But today a group of pro-independence veterans called his comments 'outrageous', saying that by invoking the memories of fallen troops he was 'taking their sacrifice in vain'.

The intervention by Lord Dannatt, who was chief of the general staff between 2006 and 2009, came as the polls showed Yes and No neck-and-neck in the lead-up to the vote this week.

However, his pleas to keep the Union together for the sake of the dead soldiers' memory were quickly disowned by other unionists.

Now a group of 18 veterans of the armed forces - including a 102-year-old Desert Rat - have spoken out against the former general.

'As former UK armed forces personnel, we take the strongest possible exception to the outrageous statement by Lord Richard Dannatt implying that our fallen comrades died in support of a No vote in a Scottish independence referendum.

'How dare he take their sacrifice in vain and try to turn it to political advantage - particularly having presided over the destruction of Scotland's historic regiments.

'People who serve in the armed forces and veterans hold a variety of different views on Scotland's future. We are all voting Yes on Thursday, others will vote No.

'It is that freedom to decide matters democratically which our service men and women have helped safeguard for generations - it is not about bolstering the position of a self-serving Westminster establishment - and the people of Scotland will choose on Thursday.'

The signatories include Second World War veteran Jimmy Sinclair, former Royal Marine Keith Brown, who is now a minister in the Scottish government, and ex-intelligence officer Colin May.

Lord Dannatt wrote in the Sunday Telegraph: 'Do the families of Scottish soldiers who lost their lives between 1969 and 2007 to preserve the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom now just say, "Well, it no longer matters"?

'I cannot speak for them, but I wonder just how much thought, appreciation and recognition is given to the memory of those who have fought and brought this United Kingdom of ours to where it is today, and where it could be in the future.

'And I really worry on behalf of the wives, mothers and friends of those Scottish soldiers who died to keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.

'I worry particularly about the extent that we will be letting them down if Scotland disappears from our country, just on the whim of a few thousand voters willing to gamble on an uncertain future rather than staying within the United Kingdom, whose track record is second to none in Europe.'

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, who is campaigning against independence, distanced himself from the remarks.

'I am unyielding in my admiration and respect for the men and women of the British armed forces and the contribution that Scots have played and continue to play in those forces,' he told Sky News yesterday.

'But many British soldiers have given their lives over the years to defeat fascism and then to defend democracy and let's be absolutely clear: what we are witnessing here in Scotland on Thursday is an exercise in democracy. So I hold no brief for Lord Dannatt this morning.'

The future of the UK's military has been a hot topic in the referendum campaign, with senior figures warning that Scottish independence would gravely weaken Britain's capabilities.

The Scottish government has pledged to ban Trident nuclear missiles from sheltering in Scottish waters, as they do now.
