Period dramas such as Downton Abbey have fuelled the boom in demand for starched collars, the owner of the Barker Group laundry, which specialises in the collars, has claimed

A century ago they were the essential complement to the English stiff upper lip, before falling out of fashion for being, well, rather too stiff.

Now starched collars are enjoying something of a revival – thanks to Downton Abbey.

A laundry in Bournemouth, which claims to offer the world's only traditional starched collar service, says TV period dramas are fuelling a boom in demand for its skills.

The Barker Group now produces around 80,000 stiff collars a year for clients all over the world, who include royalty, the judiciary and the military.

Owner Matthew Barker has supplied collars for movie blockbusters such as Sherlock Holmes and Titanic, as well as TV series including Downton and Poirot.

Mr Barker said: 'The market place that has really grown most significantly in the last five years is theatre, television and film. There are a lot more period dramas now, shows like Downton Abbey.

'Any period drama you see on television where they are wearing starched collars, generally we have supplied them. It's bizarre seeing your product everywhere, but great.'

Pensioner Alice Allen, who had 57 years' experience of making starched collars at a London laundry, was hired to teach Barker Group staff how to hone their skills.

She had worked at a laundry in London making collars from the age of 13 until it closed when she was 80. Mr Barker paid for her to come to Bournemouth on several trips and teach his staff everything she knew.

There are only two people working in the collar-making department of the laundry, but Mr Barker makes sure there are always three people in the business at any one time that have the skills to 'keep the knowledge alive'.

'There are 60 separate steps to the process and if you miss out any one of those elements the finished collar won't be right. Each stage is absolutely crucial,' he said.

'Simplified, it has to be starched, brought back to a particular humidity in the drying out process, go through the roller at 200 degrees and then be ironed and polished to give it a smooth sheen, turned down and then completely aired out.

'We made an adequate collar until about 2002 and then I was introduced to Alice. It was all she had done all her life and she knew her stuff.

'We learnt a huge amount from her. She honed our skills and gave us the edge we have today.

'When I started we were doing ten collars a week, sometimes less, now we do in excess of 1,500 a week for customers in the UK, mainland Europe, America and last year we had our first client from Tokyo.'

A stiff collar is separate from a shirt and is fastened by studs. The starching makes the collar as hard as cardboard and the collar is then polished to give a sharp finish to formal wear.

The idea was to allow gents in the 1800s and early 1900s to wear the same shirt for a week, just changing the collar, without the washing the whole shirt.

The collar starts as a piece of cotton and goes through 60 different stages to become the finished product, with each stage being equally crucial.
