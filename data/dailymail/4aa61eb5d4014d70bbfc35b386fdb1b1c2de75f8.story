A City financier who was made a Tory peer on Friday had given the party more than £330,000 just weeks earlier, it emerged yesterday.

Michael Farmer’s latest donation is believed to take the total value of his gifts to the Conservatives close to £7million.

His appointment sparked a cash-for-honours row, with critics claiming wealthy donors were able to buy places in the legislature.

Hedge fund manager, Michael Farmer, was given a peerage by the Prime Minister last week - just weeks after handing the party more than £300,000

Now the latest Electoral Commission figures have revealed that Farmer – who was appointed as the Tories’ co-treasurer in 2012 to help raise money – had donated £333,500 himself between April and June.

Mr Farmer is known in the City as ‘Mr Copper’ after he made £100million in the international metal markets. He now runs the hedge fund Red Kite Capital Management.

As well as donating several million pounds to the Tory party, the committed Christian has also given money to the think-tank set up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith – the Centre for Social Justice, which works to defend the family unit.

David Cameron has been accused by Labour of standing up for 'the privileged few' after taking millions of pounds from wealthy City donors

Of his political donations, Mr Farmer has previously said: ‘You can call me a City fat cat if you want, but I’m not giving away my hard-earned money for fun. 

'I’m giving it away because I want to fund something I genuinely believe: that Cameron and the Tories will be a far better Government for the country than Labour.’ 

Last week the father-of-three said he was ‘greatly honoured’ to have been nominated by the Prime Minister to become a Conservative peer.

He said he was looking forward ‘to working and supporting the Government in the House of Lords, in particular in its important long-term work for the economy, and in its ongoing reform of our welfare and educational systems’.

Analysis by the Electoral Reform Society found that of the 21 new peers appointed by the three main parties, six were donors, while 16 had previously held some form of political position.

Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: ‘These appointments further cement the impression that to get into the House of Lords, all you have to do is write a fat cheque to a political party or be a party hack.’ 

The appointment of Mr Farmer and his fellow new peers – including former M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose and The Apprentice star Karren Brady – boosted the numbers in the Lords to some 850.

Other donors elevated to the Upper Chamber included jewellery tycoon Ranbir Singh Suri, dubbed the King of Bling, who gave more than £300,000 to the Tories either personally or through his firm.

The Conservatives have strongly defended the appointment of Mr Farmer, describing him as a ‘worthy recipient’ of a peerage. 

Tory sources pointed out Mr Farmer’s philanthropic work and sponsorship of a successful academy school in south London.

A Conservative Party spokesman added: ‘All donations to the Conservative Party are fully and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and published on their website.’

Donations to Ukip have exceeded those to the Liberal Democrats for the first time.

The party was given more than £1.4million in the three months to June – a three-fold increase on the previous period – compared to the Lib Dems’ total of £1.2million.

Most of the Ukip total was accounted for by a single donation from Yorkshire entrepreneur and former Tory donor Paul Sykes, who gave the party just over £1million.

It comes after Ukip reported its membership numbers had surged to nearly 40,000 during the European elections, meaning the party now has nearly as many members as the Lib Dems, who reported more than 43,500 members in their latest figures.

The donations may be seen as reflecting the parties’ respective political fortunes over recent months. While Ukip romped to victory in the European Parliament elections in May, the Lib Dems saw their number of MEPs slashed from 11 to one.

Ukip said the numbers were testament to the fact that the party was ‘replacing the Lib Dems as the third party of British politics’.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘We have got a long way to go in terms of our fundraising but we are getting there.

‘To overhaul the Lib Dems for the first time is another symptom of a very real change that is taking place in British politics.’

The figures were released by the Electoral Commission. They also revealed the Conservative Party has raised £7,185,709 in donations, nearly half of all the money raised by all political parties over the three month period – and almost double the £3.7million raised by Labour.
