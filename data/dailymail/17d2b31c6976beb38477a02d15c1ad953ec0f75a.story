Libyan soldiers involved in a British Army training programme beset by allegations of rape, drunkenness and fighting  have claimed asylum, the Government admitted today.

Hundreds of Libyan cadets were invited to the UK to strengthen the country's besieged security forces, as western leaders scrambled to control the growing anarchy sweeping the north African state.

But the programme was closed down earlier this month after the Libyan soldiers were ordered home in disgrace after a 'totally unacceptable' breakdown of discipline.

On their way home: 300 Libyan troops training at  Bassingbourn Barracks in Cambridgeshire (pictured) have been sent back early following alleged sex attacks

Five cadets were placed in police custody facing sex charges after a series of violations described as 'beyond the pale' by the head of the Army General Sir Nicholas Carter.

Now Deference Secretary Michael Fallon has admitted that a number of the cadets have refused to go home and have instead claimed asylum.

He told MPs a 'very small handful' of Libyan soldiers involved in the training programme had asked to stay.

Mr Fallon told the Commons that of the 328 total originally signed up to the scheme, around 100 left during the course of their training by agreement with the Libyan authorities.

The remainder had now all been returned 'properly' to Libya, he added, apart from five who remain in custody and a 'very small handful' who have claimed asylum.

He was replying to a question from shadow defence minister Kevan Jones who asked how many of the service personnel still remained on UK soil.

Earlier this month, David Cameron insisted no Libyan soldiers involved in the programme should be granted asylum.

The Prime Minister labelled the disciplinary issues at Bassingbourn Barracks  as 'completely unacceptable'.

General Sir Nicholas Carter told MPs the behaviour of the Libyan cadets was 'beyond the pale'

Up to 2,000 soldiers had been due to undergo basic infantry and junior command training at the barracks as part of an agreement reached at last year's G8 summit.

The training agreement was part of a pledge to support Libya's effort to improve security following the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011.

Since then the country has been in a state of flux with two rival governments, disparate tribes and Islamist militia embroiled in conflict. 

Head of the army General Sir Nicholas Carter admitted the behaviour of Libyan soldiers who went on the rampage outside their barracks  was 'beyond the pale'.

His remarks came after the Prime Minister demanded military top brass explain the 'unacceptable' breakdown of discipline  which saw hundreds of Libyan cadets sent home in disgrace amid allegations of rape, drunkenness, fighting and theft.

Mr Cameron said the the Government programme to train up Libya's army would be scrapped and all the trainees based in Britain deported.

Two thousand Libyan cadets – hand-picked by the British Army – were supposed to be given leadership skills in the UK to help their war-torn country. 

But the scheme has been beset by difficulties from the start - with trainees allowed to run amok outside their barracks in Cambridgeshire.

Since the training course began in June, Libyan cadets hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night - while another two  trainees have been charged with raping a man in a park.

General discipline collapsed, with one in ten refusing to obey orders - with one UK trainer reportedly headbutted and another apparently threatened by a Libyan mob.
