Rappers and police are famed for never seeing eye to eye.

So when police in the Midlands interrupted a rapper and his crew while filming a music video, things got pretty heated.

Leicester-based rapper KY and his crew were on location when two police officers approached them and started questioning them about being on 'private property'.

The cameras that were capturing the music video continue to roll as moments later a disagreement begins.

And KY decides the time is right to flex his creative juices and deliver a freestyle rap which will belittle the long arm of the law.

Unimpressed when one of the officers calls him a 'friend', the rapper he insists 'we are far from friends' and adds: 'we're enemies if anything.'

But once the initial tension is distilled, the rapper launches into his freestyle tirade which includes the line: 'They're trying to stop and pull up at my video shoot, but it's cool because they're nothing but dudes, they got bullied in school, that's why they're trying to be rude.' 

The police can be seen laughing nervously in the background before driving off in their car. It seems they did not appreciate KY's freestyle rap demonstration.

Not a police fan: KY looks irritated by the presence of the police as he raps during his freestyle
