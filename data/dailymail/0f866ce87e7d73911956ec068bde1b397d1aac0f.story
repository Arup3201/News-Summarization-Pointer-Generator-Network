Apple boss Tim Cook today paid tribute to Steve Jobs on the first anniversary of his death.

The firm gave over its entire homepage to a short film which highlights Jobs achievements and his key speeches, which became known as 'Jobsnotes'.

The film is followed by a letter from Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, which is signed simply 'Tim'.

On the first anniversary of his death, Apple gave over its entire homepage to a film about Steve Jobs

Cook writes: 'Steve's passing one year ago today was a sad and difficult time for all of us.

'I hope that today everyone will reflect on his extraordinary life and the many ways he made the world a better place."

Jobs died on October 5, 2011, aged 56, just hours after Apple launched the iPhone 4S in an event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California.

He was first diagnosed with a pancreas neuroendocrine tumour in 2003, and underwent a liver transplant in 2009 - although did not immediately admit to it.

In early 2011 announced that he was taking a third leave of absence from Apple for health reasons.

Ill health finally forced him to resign as Apple's chief executive in August 2011, when he became chairman.

However, it was believed Jobs carried on working for the company he created with Steve Wozniak in his parents garage on April 1st 1976 until his final hours.

Tim Cook, who had acted as chief executive three times while Jobs was on medical leave, replaced him.

A makeshift memorial for Steve Jobs at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California set up by fans of the company when he passed away after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

'One of the greatest gifts Steve gave to the world is Apple,' Cook said in his letter.

'No company has ever inspired such creativity or set such high standards for itself.

'Our values originated from Steve and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.

'We share the great privilege and responsibility of carrying his legacy into the future.'

However, the firm has come under fire in recent months after Cook was forced to issue an embarrassing apology for its maps apps, which led many to speculate that the company's standards were slipping.

Cook's message concludes: 'I'm incredibly proud of the work we are doing, delivering products that our customers love and dreaming up new ones that will delight them down the road.

'It's a wonderful tribute to Steve's memory and everything he stood for.'

It is believe the firm, which is now the world's largest in terms of market capitalisation, is putting the final touches to a mini version of its hugely popular iPad.

The iPad mini is expected to be revealed later this month as the firm tries to quell sales of amazon's Kindle and Google's Nexus 7, both of which have smaller screens that the iPad.

Cook's message, signed 'Tim' was displayed after the short film on Apple's site today.
