A French bistro is set to lose its licence after a council launched an investigation into it holding 'sex parties' in the basement.

Bosses of the Le Bourgeois eatery - situated on the ground floor of a 1960s tower block called Eros House in Catford, south London - have been told that its license faces being withdrawn after a raft of complaints from neighbours.

The notoriety of the restaurant has become so widespread even the local MP, Labour's Heidi Alexander has got involved after dozens of locals got in touch with her.

The Metropolitan Police are also vying for the restaurant to lose its licence, and a report from police officers recommending it be closed is set to be handed into Lewisham Council licensing chiefs on Thursday this week.

According to locals the bistro holds regular 'basement sex parties', with strippers and exotic dancers and 'private booths' for regulars.

Locals also reported people openly having sex outside the eatery - whose name translates as 'the middle classes' - with one saying he found hands prints all over his car, suggesting someone had romped on his bonnet.

Speaking this week, Lewisham East MP Heidi Alexander said she was first aware of activities at the restaurant nine months ago.

She said: 'People told me there are strippers inside and there are people having sex at the back of the restaurant.

'Given the length of time that these problems have been going on, I do think some serious action needs to be taken.'

A string of locals have provided statements to police urging the council to withdraw the restaurant's licence because of a steady stream of incidents over the past year.

One man said he ended up leaving his flat at weekends so he could 'get some peace'.

He said in a letter to the Met: 'It is having a detrimental effect to my physical and mental well being and has got to the stage where I have to leave my flat on weekends and look for where I can go to in order that I can have a peaceful weekend.'

Another said: 'On several occasions I saw finger and hand prints places on the bonnet of my car in a compromising position.'

Other residents also vented their anger, with one man saying: 'There are lots of strange people wandering the building, usually very drunk, stinking of alcohol and or carrying bottles/cans of strong alcohol.'

Another said: 'I have been informed by a co-resident that sex activities are going on in the basement... she found used condoms constantly in the basement after parties at Le Bourgeois.'

And yet another wrote to the police to say: 'The noise, fighting, gangs hanging around, drug dealing, shouting and screaming, all from this club, is getting to my wits end.'

Others said the restaurant was a 'haven' for sex parties, with one saying that a 'pool party' held last summer - in which punters turned up in swimming costumes - turned into a 'sexual free for all'.

He said: 'They all turned up in swimming costumes - maybe 20 people and by the end of the night they were outside having sex on cars and on the pavement - it's disgusting.'

Police said that parties - called 'late night adult parties' - are advertised as The Thick Lick - which is slang for a 'sensual massage' which ends up with a pair having sex.

The ads for the parties state that the restaurant will lay on 'male and female performers, exotic dancers, private rooms'.

Jokers wrote online about the restaurant's reputation, with one - calling himself Madras - saying: 'Well, it is a French restaurant - how terribly bourgeois.'

Another said: 'Sounds more like the kind of thing the proletariat would like, not the bourgeois.'

The council's licensing committee will meet on Thursday this week to decide on the fate of the eatery.

Nobody was available for comment from the bistro.
