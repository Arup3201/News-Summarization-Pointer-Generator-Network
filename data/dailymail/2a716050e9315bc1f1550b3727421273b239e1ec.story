Christmas is a time for full-on glamour, but I’m not a fan of plunging necklines which can look desperate on an older woman — unless you’re Joan Collins. However, too much fabric says ‘matronly’ and boring.

How wonderful then that many of this year’s frocks come with a daring twist. Demure and covered at the front, they swoop sexily — in some cases perilously — low at the back.

They’re marvellous fun at drinks parties: chat sweetly to the vicar while letting the chap behind know you’re less buttoned up than he thought.

So which of the sexiest backless dresses on the High Street left me feeling full of Christmas sparkle?

SHIMMERING CHIC

Gold sequin full length dress, £350, Phase-eight.com

I’m becoming seriously addicted to Phase Eight. This beautiful dress is part of their ‘Collection’ and, although it’s expensive, you get what you pay for.

There’s loads of hand-finishing and the stunning sequins — muted enough to gleam elegantly rather than blind you — coupled with the elegant net, silky lining and gorgeous shape make me feel like a million-dollar mermaid.

And — oh joy! — the cleverly positioned back strap, fitted with a cunning loop, enables you to wear a normal bra. Yesterday, I saw a bride emerging from Chelsea Register Office in this dress, and she looked stunning. 5/5

FORGIVING AND FABULOUS 

Coral maxi dress, £130, Honorgold.co.uk; earrings, £278, Dowerandhall.com

I leapt at this hour-glass shaped dress as soon as I saw it on the hanger: it’s such a gorgeous, mood-lifting colour, and not one I’d usually think of wearing.

It’s very well priced, easy to wear and the stretchy lace is not only firm enough to keep me comfortable without a bra, it’s also very forgiving to any droopy bits. It fastens with a pretty diamante clasp, too. 5/5

NO ROOM FOR A BRA 

Bodycon dress, £65, Mistressrocks.com; shoes, £195, Lucychoilondon.com; earrings, £95, Dowerandhall.com

This was the hardest for me to wear: it looks good from a certain distance but it’s so tight and clingy that it would be best on someone younger.

It’s very sexy and fantastic value for a designer lookalike, but you need to avoid it if you’ve any spare flesh. Brilliant for Christmas parties in a red, but make sure you’re chauffeured around — there’s no running for a bus or taxi in the tight skirt. And there’s absolutely no room for a bra — I went for a clever trick from my theatre days, a skin-to-fabric glue called ‘It Stays’. It really does. 3/5

WHAT A LITTLE GEM 

Navy jewel strap full-length dress, £45, Axparis.com; Earrings, £15, Coast-stores.com

Excellent all round this one, and an amazing price. It’s extremely comfortable and the high, elasticised Empire-line waist supported me just enough to make a bra unnecessary. The very pretty neckline is jazzed up with shiny ‘jewels’ and I love the cute little tie at the back, which makes it feel very secure — and sexy. 4/5

HEART STEALER

Teal full-length dress, £69.99, Mango.com; necklace, £45, Coast-stores.com

Another very good price but the material feels rather stiff — there’s not much give in it so it needs to fit well and you wouldn’t want to overindulge on the cheese straws in this one.

It’s tricky bra-wise as the sides are cut away at the back in a heart shape, so it needs the cups-only sticky-on type, but the shape is very flattering. 3/5

SO GLAM - BUT BEWARE OF VPL

Long-sleeved full-length dress, £75, Hedonia.co.uk; sandals, £175, Russellandbromley.co.uk; belt, £60, and earrings, £18, Debenhams.com

Very good value for a glamorous red dress but the material is a bit thin and so clingy that you have to wear knickers without a VPL, or be brave and wear none at all!

The good thing here is that the V at the back isn’t too wide, so you can get away with a sticky-winged bra with this — and the long sleeves are great if you worry about exposed arms. 3/5

A sexily low swoop at the back of the dress is perfect for parties
