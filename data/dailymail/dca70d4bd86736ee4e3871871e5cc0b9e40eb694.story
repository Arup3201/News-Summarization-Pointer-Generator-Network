Scotland hero Shaun Maloney thanked coach Stuart McCall for being the architect of the glorious goal that sank the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park.

The Wigan man savoured perhaps his finest moment in the dark blue of his country — and an unforgettable career highlight — when he curled home a brilliant shot from the fringe of the area with 15 minutes remaining.

It was a sublime finishing touch to the nimblest of moves, with Maloney and Ikechi Anya working a short corner routine before skipper Scott Brown set up his former Celtic team-mate with a back-heel flick.

Maloney revealed it was a routine plotted by former Motherwell manager McCall — Scotland’s third in command — during preparations at their Mar Hall training base.

But the 31-year-old revealed it was very much a case of alright on the night after a series of botched attempts at the move in the build-up to the crunch Euro 2016 qualifier.

‘I was confident that we would score but maybe not in the way we did,’ admitted Maloney.

‘It was a slight variation on what we worked on in training. The way Ireland set up made us change it slightly. We worked on something similar this week and the coach has to take credit for this.

‘It was Stuart McCall, he worked on it. It came off slightly differently to what we had been planning. Stuart and Mark McGhee work pretty hard on these set-pieces and they don’t always come off.

‘It went in zero times in training! These things you practise hundreds of times and you just kind of hope that they (the opposition) switch off and it happens in a match like it did tonight.

‘You get an initial reaction when connecting with the ball, but the difference between that going in and hitting the post is millimetres. You know you have a fair chance of scoring, but it was just pure elation at the time when it went in.

‘I’ve been fortunate to score some special goals — but this is right up there and it meant the world to me and the team. It was a special moment to be part of.

‘There wasn’t much in the game and it wasn’t overly pretty. We always felt there would be one moment either for us or Ireland that would settle the game.’

On a bruising night at Celtic Park, captain Scott Brown insisted Scotland had defied an Irish plan to knock them out of their stride — by fair means or foul.

Martin O’Neill’s side thundered into challenges throughout the match, earning four bookings to the two picked up by Strachan’s side.

Seamus Coleman could well have seen red for clattering through goal hero Maloney in the latter stages but Serbian referee Milorad Mazic allowed play to continue and didn’t return with a second yellow card for the Everton right-back.

That kind of physical confrontation is meat-and-drink to toughened competitors such as Brown, but he expressed pride in the way the entire Scottish team stood tall.

‘I think Ireland’s gameplan was to try and stop us playing football,’ said Brown. ‘But it didn’t work.

‘We still managed to get the ball down in tight situations and play, knock nice little one-twos and create chances for ourselves.

‘Were Ireland lucky to finish with 11 men? I don’t know. There were a few rough tackles but I didn’t get a good eye on them.

‘Overall, it was a good night. It wasn’t the best performance in the world but we got the victory.

‘I think Ireland came up with a plan where they tried to play from back to front. They tried to impose their own gameplan but we kept trying to get the ball down and trying to play.

‘Did we deserve to win? Yeah. Definitely. I think we were the better team from start to finish. We tried to play football and I think that is what the fans keep coming along to see.’

The Scotland camp had protested pre-match that last night’s encounter was not a ‘must-win’ occasion, but Brown did not attempt to downplay the importance of the result.

Poland’s rout of Georgia merely increased the need for victory, with Strachan’s side now sitting alongside Ireland and world champions Germany on seven points after four games.

England visit Parkhead for a high-profile friendly on Tuesday evening before Gibraltar come to Glasgow on Euro 2016 business in March. The return match with O’Neill’s men is in Dublin in June.

‘It is shaping up to be a great group and there is still an awful lot to do,’ said Brown.

‘We just want to keep things going when the qualifiers start again.

‘This has been a great result in front of 60,000 people at Celtic Park. It is huge for us.

‘We have got a winning mentality and we want to continue it. We have another big game on Tuesday night against England.

‘Even though it is a friendly we want to keep the winning mentality that the manager has instilled in us. We follow his lead and we try to get the ball down to play football that entertains the fans who come along.

‘None of like to get beat and you could see that tonight in our performance. All 11 men defended at times and then we worked together to create chances. We were putting pressure on their defence and eventually it paid off.

‘We can do both sides to the game. We can defend and we can play football and counter-attack with pace.’
