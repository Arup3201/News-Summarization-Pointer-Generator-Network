Just days after Paul Ryan was forced into a humiliating U-turn after falsely claiming that he once ran a marathon in under three hours, questions are now being asked about the vice-presidential candidate's claim to be a prolific mountain climber.

Mitt Romney's running mate told his hometown newspaper that he had scaled 'close to 40' of Colorado's 54 'fourteeners' mountains, each of which is at least 14,000ft tall.

Although Mr Ryan made this claim three years ago, it is now under scrutiny after he admitted on Saturday that he hasn't run a marathon in under three hours, as he had boasted last month on a radio show broadcast across the U.S.

Exaggerating? Paul Ryan, pictured on the campaign trail in Adel, Iowa, yesterday, claimed he has scaled 'close to 40' of Colorado's 'fourteeners' range of 54 peaks

The conservative Wisconsin congressman was forced to admit that he misstated his time by more than an hour. It turns out he actually took more than four hours to finish the marathon and not under three, as he had said.

Now experienced climbers are pouring doubt on Mr Ryan's mountain claims, reports TheAtlantic.com.

One expert at climbing website SuperTopo said: 'To have climbed 40 and not be a resident [in Colorado] means that you would have had to devote entire summers to climbing fourteeners, in essence becoming a 'lifestyle' hiker/scrambler.

'I doubt Ryan had the time or dedication to fourteeners to take the required time out from his political career.

'Even if you did four a summer, that would be ten summers devoted to travelling to Colorado for the purpose of high altitude hiking. Even if you live here and can drive to the trail heads, forty is a huge commitment of time and energy.'

The climber added: 'Why does it 
matter that Paul Ryan -as seems likely in light of his marathon 
fabrication - is not a 'mountain man' and is lying about his fourteener 
record?

'Because there is 
no better index of character. It tells of someone's desperation to 
connect to the voters of a swing state, his ability to make stuff up 
without conscience, and ruthless ambition to obtain power through any 
means.

'It also indicates his contempt for the citizens of Colorado. He apparently believes that Colorado voters are clueless and that the press is a lapdog that has lost any ability to check facts.

'Dedicated hikers, scramblers, climbers, hunters, fishermen and other aficionados of the Colorado high peaks do not need to exaggerate their visceral connection to the Colorado high country and need not apply to become a faux mountain man, like Paul Ryan.']

Mr Ryan admitted his actual marathon 
time after Runner's World magazine unearthed evidence he had completed a
single marathon in 1990, and finished in just over four hours.

That time stands in stark contrast to what he had previously said, when he proudly bragged to radio host Hugh Hewitt that he had run a 'two hour and fifty-something' marathon.

That would make for a pace of less 
than seven minutes per mile for the 26.2 mile course - a blazing speed 
for recreational runners.

'Under
three, high twos. I had a two hour and fifty-something,' Mr Ryan 
reportedly told Mr Hewitt, to which the shocked radio-man expressed 
reportedly exclaimed, 'Holy smokes.'

'I was fast when I was younger, yeah,' Mitt Romney's running mate quipped in reply.

The
Ryan campaign told Runner’s World magazine that the House Budget 
Chairman ran one marathon in 1990 when he was 20 years old. That was the
Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota. The running magazine reports 
he finished in four hours, one minute, and 25 seconds.

It turns out Ryan is slower than Sarah Palin, but faster than Al Gore.

Mrs Palin reportedly has a best time of 3:59; John Edwards has run 3:30; George W Bush has run 3:44; while Mr Gore trails the vice presidential bunch with a 4:58.

A spokesman for the Romney/Ryan campaign contacted TheAtlantic.com to defend the vice-presidential candidate's comments on his experience of climbing in Colorado.

Brandon Buck said: 'We're not sure where this started, but he's not said 40 different peaks, it's nearly 40 climbs - with a number of peaks climbed more than once.

'He's been doing them for more than 20 years. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article from  2009 doesn't say 40 separate summits, but instead :

'He is fairly careful about what he eats, performs an intense cross-training routine known as P90X most mornings, and has made close to 40 climbs of Colorado's fourteeners.'

A 'fourteener' is a term unique to mountaineers in the U.S.

It refers to a mountain peak that is more than 14,000ft above sea level, of which there are 53 in Colorado, known as the Colorado Fourteeners.

The tallest is Mount Elbert, which is part of the Sawatch Range and stands at 14,440ft tall.

In 53rd place is Sunshine Peak, which is part of the San Juan Mountains range and is 14,009ft tall.

Other popular fourteeners include the 14,110ft tall Pikes Peak, which inspired the poem 'America the Beautiful' and 14,255ft tall Longs Peak, which resides inside Rocky Mountain National Park.

Colorado is extremely popular with climbers and attracts tens of thousands of skiiers each winter.

Ryan's spokesman tried to clarify his comments, saying he did not climb 40 separate peaks, but has climbed some more than once

Ryan has already been forced to admit previous claim that he ran marathon in under three hours was exaggerated by more than an hour
