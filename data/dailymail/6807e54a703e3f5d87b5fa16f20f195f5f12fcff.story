The annals of war are full of stories of lovelorn soldiers on the front line, dreaming wistfully of a girl back home. 

Evangeline Poteat was one such dream girl ... but rather than consuming the thoughts of a single soldier, she was desired by three.

Now, a collection of 18 love letters sent to the 22-year-old factory worker from the trio of admirers during the Second World War are to go under the hammer.

They reveal three men in love, each fighting on two fronts: on one for their country, and on another for her heart.

Never met: Evangeline Poteat (right) ultimately chose Teal Davis (left), an air-crew chief stationed in Burma - even though they had never met

Under the hammer: A collection of 18 love letters sent to the 22-year-old factory worker from the trio of admirers during the Second World War are to go under the hammer

Love battle: They reveal three men in love, each fighting on two fronts - on one for their country, and on the other for her heart

Two of the men she knew, having dated them before the outbreak of war in her hometown of Bakersville, North Carolina. The third she had never met.

What followed was a war of passion between the three men - though it is unclear if each knew of the others' intentions - fought on paper with pen and ink.

'I know that you think that I am crazy for asking you so many times,' one writes from Camp Cooke, an Army training center in California. 'Did you think the ring idea is OK with you, or is it? I love you.'

Another, also based in California, remembers his high school days with Evangeline, gushing: 'We used to really have a swell time until Uncle Sam nabbed me.'

But it was the third she ultimately chose, thanks to his 11 intimate letters that reveal a man in love - despite never having laid eyes on the object of his affections.

His name was Teal Davis, an air-crew chief stationed in Burma.

Competition: Two of the men she knew, having dated them before the outbreak of war in her hometown of Bakersville, North Carolina. The third she had never met (This is one of Teal's letters from Burma)

Paper battlefield: What followed was a war of passion between the three men - though it is unclear if each knew of the others' intentions - fought on paper with pen and ink

His first dispatch begins with 'Hello, Van.' But as their communications become more intimate, that turns to 'Dearest' and he signs off with 'Always'.

Enigmatically, the collection contains none of Evangeline's responses to any of the men, so the reader is left to imagine what she must have felt.

But what is clear is each man's intentions: they all yearned for the war to end so they could return to marry their sweetheart.

Seventy years on, the letters, revealed by The State newspaper, are being sold by Sally MacNamara Ivey, a collector of historical memorabilia from Portland, Oregon. She bought them from a Portland dealer for $35. How they ended up in Portland - so far from Evangeline's home - is a mystery.

War hero: Teal was awarded the Soldier's Medal for bravery and heroism beyond the call of duty when he and three others rescued a crew member after an oxygen tank exploded, catching a plane on fire

Ivey auctioned the letters on eBay, under the heading 'Handwritten World War II love letters.' She said in the listing: 'I really wanted to see a photo of her after reading these letters, too, because she was quite the beauty according to the three soldiers who wrote to her.'

She remembers being struck by 'how deeply in love' Evangeline and Teal were, despite having never met.

She was introduced to Teal through his sister, a college friend of Evangeline at Appalachian State Teachers College where she was studying to be a teacher in 1943.

Married: Teal, 25, and Evangeline, 23, married on April 21, 1946, in a candlelight wedding at Bakersville Baptist Church. She wore a white-lace gown with an amethyst-and-pearl necklace that belonged to her grandmother

But she didn't actually write to him until 1944, after she had postponed her education to join the war effort, making anti-aircraft shells for the Navy in a munitions factory in Charlotte.

He wrote back on May 15, just three weeks before the Allied troops would storm Normandy in the D-Day invasion.

Rather than discuss the dangers he faces in Burma, Teal instead writes about his love for the North Carolina mountains. 'A fellow never realizes how beautiful his own home country is until he gets halfway around the world from it.

'I was just thinking of the noises you can hear in those mountains early in the mornings and comparing them with here. Over here just walking to work (in knee-deep mud, of course) you hear wild chickens, parrots screeching, monkeys screaming and carrying on, and then comes the roar of airplane engines --- such a combination. ...

'I'll be looking forward to the day when I can meet you in person, but for now a letter will do. Be good, have fun this summer and write soon.

'Sincerely, Teal.'

In his letters - some as long as seven pages - he writes about the monotony of breakfast - how they ate 'french toast, powdered eggs, french toast, powdered eggs'. He tells how he spent evenings watching movies, including The Wizard of Oz or wondering when he'd next hear back from her.

Then, on December 2, 1944, seven months since their first correspondence, Teal sends two photographs of himself, and asks Evangeline the burning question.

'Home or church wedding?' he writes. 'Those big weddings are pretty and all, but a simple little home marriage seems more earnest and sincere. ...

'What I'm trying to say is that I only want to get married once and that's for keeps.'

He continues: 'I'll never be content until I've met you and tried to make some daydreams come true.

'You know, I've quit trying to reason out why I should fall for someone I've never met - it just happened.'

He often quotes song lyrics to describe how he feels when he opens her mail: 'I feel like a feather in the breeze' and 'It rains pennies from heaven.'

He also impresses her with his sense of humour and penchant for word play. In one letter he describes his comrades' reactions to a movie, The Rainbow Road.

Lifetime of happiness: They lived out their days enjoying the quiet life. Teal worked in the post office for more than 20 years, then for more than 25 years at the family's building supplies business

Emotional: Reading their father's letters was an emotional experience for the couple's two children, Larry Davis, 67, and Jane Simmons, 63, who had no idea they existed. They said reading his words as a young man in love with their mother, brought him back to life for a moment

'You know the kind (of movie it is) - lots of girls in sarongs, but not so much sarong on the girls. The way the guys were ohing and ahing there wasn't anything sarong (so wrong) with the picture.'

Teal was awarded the Soldier's Medal for bravery and heroism beyond the call of duty when he and three others rescued a crew member after an oxygen tank exploded, catching a plane on fire. 

By March 1945, it appears he received from her the news he had longed for.

'You asked if I minded you saying that you love me,' he writes. 'Hon, I'm just happy that you can say that.' 

Teal, 25, and Evangeline, 23, married on April 21, 1946, in a candlelight wedding at Bakersville Baptist Church. She wore a white-lace gown with an amethyst-and-pearl necklace  that belonged to her grandmother.

They had two children, Larry, born in 1947, and Jane, in 1951.

They lived out their days enjoying the quiet life. Teal worked in the post office for more than 20 years, then for more than 25 years at the family's building supplies business. 

Evangeline brought up their children before returning to college to get her teaching certificate, then She was a teacher from 1963 until the mid-1980s.

Teal died in 2001 of emphysema. 'Evangeline rarely left his side - only to get chemotherapy for her throat cancer, and for an occasional rest when her family demanded it, wrote The Slate. 

Evangeline suffered a stroke in February 2004. She died a year later. 

Their children, Larry Davis, 67, and Jane Simmons, 63, told The Slate of their surprise that the letters that brought their parents together during World War II still exist and had emerged on eBay. And they have no idea how they ended up in Portland.

Nevertheless, reading their father's words as a young man in love with their mother, brought him back to life for a moment.

'I can hear him,' Larry said. 'But a lot of it is the way I never heard him.'
