Diego Simeone’s Atletico side have been the surprise package of the 2013-14 campaign in Spain.

They are locked on 49 points with Barca, with only the defending champions’ superior goal difference keeping them top of the league, while rivals Real Madrid are five points adrift.

Here, Pete Jenson previews the big match...

Barcelona coach Tata Martino is contemplating leaving Leo Messi on the bench for Saturday night’s potential title decider against Atletico Madrid.

Messi came on as a substitute in midweek and scored twice in 25 minutes against Getafe in the Spanish Cup but 50 days without a game prior to his return has left the Argentine manager pondering his final decision.

Martino said: 'Messi likes to finish games so sometimes the best way to make sure he does not over do it is to have him come off the bench. We are always thinking about the last game, but we have to remember he was out for almost two months before that.

'He looked good on Wednesday but we will decide on Saturday whether or not he starts.'

If any team in the world can afford not to rush Messi back then it’s Barcelona who have averaged a goal every four games without him.

For the first time in their history at this stage of the sesaon Barcelona have five players on more than 10 goals. Pedro, Alexis and Cesc Fabregas have joined Messi and Neymar in double figures and leaving the four-times Ballon d’Or winner on the bench would still leave Barcelona with a front three to frighten any defence.

Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone said he doubted Martino would leave out Messi despite the form of his other strikers. He said: ‘It is possible because Barça has a wonderful squad and thanks to Martino they now have a lot of different and very dangerous options. They have survived without Messi. The other day Pedro scored a hat-trick, then Alexis scored a hat-trick. But I can’t really imagine Messi not playing in this game.’

Martino’s final doubts may turn not just on Messi’s impressive return in midweek but also on his incredible record against Atletico Madrid. Atletico are his favourite victim. He has scored 20 career goals against them – 17 coming in 14 league matches.

In what is the most eagerly anticipated game anywhere in Europe this weekend those sensational Barcelona striking options will be pitted against the meanest defence in La Liga.

Chelsea’s on loan keeper Thibaut Courtois will once again be behind Juanfran, Miranda, Diego Godin and Felipe Luis. 'We need to defend well and hurt them on the counter attack' said the Brazilian left-back who believes Atletico forward Diego Costa could be just as decisive as any of Barcelona’s attackers.

Costa whose 19 goals have him just behind Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga’s second highest scorer, will partner former Barcelona favourite David Villa for a game between two sides separated only by goal difference in the table.

Simeone admitted: ‘Individually they are better than us but we have a very strong group. We feel strong and very competitive.’

Both teams have just one defeat and one draw and Atletico have won every home game played this season. What they have failed to do over the last three years is beat Barça in any of the six league games played between the two sides. 

It is the biggest test of their title credentials but it will also test Barcelona who for all the glorious options going forward still creak at the back especially when defending set-plays. Martino’s team have conceded five times already in the league from corners and corner-kicks will be cheered like goals by the expected 54,000 sell-out crowd.

It has been ten years since neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona won the league. Valencia’s win under Rafa Benitez owed more to persistence and patience than sparkling football. Atletico Madrid’s adventure has so far been a lot more exhilarating with a Europa League and last season’s Copa del Rey win over Real Madrid picked up along the way.

Coach Diego Simeone is facing a former player in one-time River Plate striker Alexis Sanchez as well as fellow countryman Martino in the opposing dug-out.

The Argentine keeping both awake on Friday night, however, will be Messi – Martino wondering whether or not to pick him; and Simone wondering how to stop him.
