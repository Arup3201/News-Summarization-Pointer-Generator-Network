England captain Wayne Rooney says he was glad to see the younger players taking to the international challenge set by Estonia.

The Manchester United forward scored his side's only goal as Roy Hodgson's Three Lions beat Estonia 1-0 in Tallinn, and kept their 100 per cent record in Euro 2016 qualifying intact. 

'We said before the game it would be tough, and they would put men behind the ball, and tonight it was,' Rooney told ITV.

'Thankfully we got the goal, and we managed to get the points. It was close, so I was focusing on trying to get it up and over the wall as quick as I could, and thankfully it's gone in.

'We are playing well. The pleasing thing tonight is, with a young team who knew it was going to be tough, we hung in there and got the goal.

'We saw the game out well, and we are always learning as a team. It's nights like tonight that will help us.' 

It was reported Hodgson was preparing to substitute Rooney for Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert, but the former Everton starlet seemed to be unaware of the swap when asked after the match.

'I've shown over the years that I am always capable of scoring goals, and thankfully I've done that again tonight,' he replied. 

England manager Hodgson denied he was planning to bring Rooney off before the captain's winning goal in the 73rd minute after ITV claimed a form had been handed to the fourth official to make the change.

'I was in discussions with other members of my staff, I don't know about forms going in,' said Hodgson.

'No doubt you're going to produce some evidence in a minute about a form going in, but that wasn't my intention. We were going to put Rickie Lambert on and we were discussing which of the forwards to take off. 

'I hadn't made up my mind, it was probably more likely to be Danny Welbeck and it had to be Danny in the end because he tweaked his ankle.'

Hodgson added Welbeck's 'rolled ankle' was of no concern and that the Arsenal striker should be fine by the weekend. 

The England boss did, however, admit that he found it frustrating to be all square after 45 minutes. 

'To come in at half-time, after playing like that, at 0-0 there was an air of frustration,' Hodgson added.

'We had so many opportunities in and around the box, you think we had to take one, and we didn't.

'Thankfully we took one in the second half and it's four wins in a row, five clean sheets, these are things not to be sniffed at.'
