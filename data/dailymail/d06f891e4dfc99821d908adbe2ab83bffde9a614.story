Vast riches: The family of reclusive heiress Huguette Clark have launched a legal battle to take control of her millions

The family of Huguette Clark have launched a legal battle for her vast fortune after it was revealed the reclusive heiress had signed two wills.

The first document left her estimated $400 million to relatives - while the second cuts them out completely.

The two wills were signed within six weeks of each other while Miss Clark was in a New York hospital in 2005. 

Both wills are typed and appear to have been signed, with a steady hand, by Miss Clark.

Miss Clark's vast wealth came after inheriting part of her father's Montana copper empire.

She had not been seen in 70 years and spent her time in her sprawling apartment block on New York's Fifth Avenue. She died aged 104 in May.

She had made no decision who would inherit her fortune by the time she was 98.  

Her properties included a $100 million beachfront estate in 
Santa Barbara, California, a $20 million country house in New Canaan, 
Connecticut and the three apartments she owned on New York's Fifth 
Avenue, worth up to $100 million.

There was also a collection of precious paintings by Renoir and Monet and a $2.5 million doll house.

On March 7, 2005, Miss Clark signed a will from her hospital bed in New York leaving $5 million to her longtime nurse 
Hadassah Peri.

Everything else went to her 21 closest relatives, who are 
descendants of her father from his first marriage, according to 
court documents filed today.

On April 19, 2005 Clark signed a second will from her room at Beth Israel Hospital on the lower east side of Manhattan.

In this paperwork, Miss Clark cut out 
her family completely. She then revised her nurse's share to $34 
million and half a million each was assigned to her accountant and lawyer.

Her doctor received $100,000 but the largest share went to a charitable 
foundation controlled by the accountant and lawyer. It was intended to set up an art gallery in her Californian mansion Bellosguardo.

According to Miss Clark's 
executors, her attorney and accountant, the second will was already 
filed in court in June, a month after her death. The first will was turned over by the executors voluntarily 
to her family.

Relatives launched a court battle today in an
effort to take the millions out of the hands of Miss Clark's attorney and 
accountant. The family accused the executors of 'plundering' her fortune.

New York lawyers have been examining the management of of 
Miss Clark's fortune by lawyer Wallace Bock, 79, and accountant Irving Kamsler, 
64.

Investigations into Ms Clark’s estate
are currently underway, both by the Manhattan district attorney and the
state attorney general.

It is alleged Mr Bock wrongly accepted large sums of money and gifts from Miss Clark, as well as mismanaging her fortune.

Around the time that the second will was signed, Miss Clark's family claim that her attorney stopped putting through their phone calls.

Relatives have argued that they were much closer to their elderly relative than her lawyer has 
portrayed.

Though the Clark family are spread out across the U.S. and Europe, several family members were in regular contact with her 
over many years, exchanging holiday greetings and letters and having 
phone conversations arranged through her attorney.

At court in New York, the Clark family attorney John R. Morken said: 'Before the court are substantial and gravely serious issues of alleged deceit, undue influence and 
exploitation of a very elderly and extraordinarily wealthy woman at the 
hands of two professionals who, with the help of certain others, took 
control of her life, isolated her from family, and ultimately stripped 
her of her free will, as well as millions of dollars.'

'Despite her reclusive life style, 
Huguette remained true to her family and her all too important family 
name, by remaining in contact with certain of her relatives over the 
years, sharing events in their lives.

'Indeed, she well knew and was 
proud of the fact that she was a Clark, and her family was integral to 
who she was.

'She 
therefore remained close to them, but from a distance, simultaneously 
preserving her desire to communicate with her relatives and her need for
seclusion and solitude.'

'Suddenly
in or about 2004/2005, phone contact ceased, and relatives who were 
speaking to Huguette on the phone were no longer able to,' the lawyer 
added.

The Clark family claim that in 2008, 
on at least one occasion when relatives sought to visit their Aunt 
Huguette to check on her well-being, they were prevented from doing so 
by her lawyer.

Several
relatives had went to court last year to try to have a guardian appointed
to the elderly Miss Clark but the request was denied, according to 
msnbc.com.

Miss
Clark has been the subject of public fascination and an investigation 
after a century of life as a recluse.

The last photograph was taken of 
her more than 80 years ago.

She was born in Paris in 1906, the youngest child of U.S. Senator 
William Andrews Clark, who was known as one of the copper kings.

He was America's second richest man in the early 1900s behind John D Rockefeller.

He
shocked the political and financial world when he was 62 by announcing 
he had secretly married two years earlier and that his 23-year-old wife 
already had a two-year-old daughter.

Huguette Clark was married in 1928, at 22, to William Gower, a law student and Clark family employee. The couple soon separated, had no children, and divorced in less than two years, in the summer of 1930.

When Huguette's father died, his millions were divided equally between his children from both his marriages. When his daughter turned 21, she received $300million or $3.6billion in today's money.

Court documents revealed the amazing details of the millionairess's lifestyle including a bottomless $43m checking account.

The records show $126.3million was spent by her attorney and accountant from her accounts over 15 years.

Miss Clark owned various lavish 
mansions in California and Connecticut, also worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars. But she never visited and left them vacant for more than 50 
years.

A total of $2.5 
million was paid for a French doll house, as the heiress filled her home
with the delicate figurines. Another doll auction company received 21 
payments between 1997 to 2009, totaling $729,000.

A total of $380,000 in cheques was 
spent on November 16, 2009, written by either by Mr Bock or Mr Kamsler 
from Miss Clark's personal account, including one written out to her 
doctor for $50,000. Her nurse Hadassah 
Peri and her husband, each received for $60,000.

Various nurses and personal assistants also got massive sums. Mr Kamsler was not left out. He received a cheque for $60,000, and three weeks later, so did Mr Bock.

In later years, a large sum of money went to cover her ailing health. Beth Israel, which housed Miss Clark for years, received $4.9million for her care between December 1997 and February 2011.

Miss Clark's closet friend outside of Mrs Peri was Suzanne Pierre, the widow of her physician. Mrs Pierre would often serve as her social secretary and get regular payments of around $50,000. In all, she was paid $1.7million.

Mrs Pierre was also gifted with $10million in 2000. She died only weeks before Miss Clark.

Mrs Peri inherited $34 million from her late employer, making her incredibly wealthy in her own right. The Filipino-born mother tended to Miss Clark for 20 years after the nurse was randomly assigned to her by an agency in the 1990s.

Media interest: The Clark family have always been the subject of media 
speculation, particularly Huguette in recent years as many were 
fascinated by her reclusive lifestyle

Mrs Peri earned $131,000 per annum working for the reclusive heiress. The 61-year-old nurse’s 2001 Bentley Arnage sedan cost $204,000, and her Lincoln Navigator SUV was around $42,000.

The mother of three lives in luxury with her husband, with a total of five properties to her name.

They include a three-story brick home in
Manhattan Beach, complete with a swan-filled canal, and a $500,000 
beach house on an exclusive strip of the Jersey Shore.

Mrs Peri emigrated to the U.S. from the Phillipines in 1972.

But the heiress wasn’t only fond of Mrs Peri. She doted upon Mrs Peri’s three children and spared them the experience of New York City dorm life by instead securing two lavish Upper East Side condos for university.

In a statement released after Miss Clark’s death, Mrs Peri said she cared for the heiress every day for 20 years. ‘I was her private duty nurse but also her close friend. I knew her as a kind and generous person, with whom I shared many wonderful moments and whom I loved very much.’

Miss Clark died at the age of 104 in May. She hadn’t been seen in public for some 70 years, and only left her sprawling 42-room Fifth Avenue apartment to go to doctor’s appointments.

Her New York apartment is believed to have a 30ft library, a 40ft drawing room and 40ft living room as well as stunning views of Central Park. It has 42 rooms covering 15,000 square feet in total.

Ms Clark was buried at her family's mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, where the only people present were funeral home employees.

All other family members had been banned.
