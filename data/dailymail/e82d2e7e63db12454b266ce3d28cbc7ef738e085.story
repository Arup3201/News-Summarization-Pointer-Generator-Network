Jamie Oliver today revealed his political side, admitting he was delighted that Ukip are ‘stirring it up’.

The 37-year-old celebrity chef said he believed politics has become ‘more squashed in the middle and samey’ - and although he did not support the Eurosceptic party, they have ‘got my interest’.

Mr Oliver, who has long campaigned for healthy school meals, also told The Sunday Times he was angry that decades of good works by public health employees are wiped out when funding is cut.

The Essex chef has spent eight years meeting with doctors, paediatricians and cardiologists - ‘the most bang-on nutritionists in the country’ - and said they are ‘so disillusioned’ when losing funding.

Mr Oliver’s own campaign against junk food being served in school lunch halls has been held back since he clashed with Education Secretary Michael Gove following his appointment in 2010.

‘I had enough of presenting to the Government because I was not getting anywhere,’ he said, adding that the coalition’s politicians should have understood that ‘everything Labour did was not wrong’.

He also told The Sunday Times: ‘I think the public reacts to clarity… What I love is that UKIP are stirring it up. Now they have stirred it up they have got my interest and I will listen to them.’

Separately, Mr Oliver also said that schools should ban ‘packed lunches’, calling them ‘the enemy’.

The chef said he has looked through every packed lunch in most of the schools he has worked in, and found them to be full of sweets and junk food - with a lack of fruit or vegetables.

He added: 'If I had a magic wand and a wish, I would love to be able to look every British parent in the eye and say: "By the time your kid is 16 they will know how to cook 10 meals to save their life".’
