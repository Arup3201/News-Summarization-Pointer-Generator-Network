Danger: Older people with moderately low blood levels of vitamin D are up to two-thirds more at risk of contracting dementia or Alzheimer's in later life

Older people with low vitamin D levels were more than twice as likely to develop any kind of dementia, warn researchers.

An international team, led by Dr David Llewellyn at the University of Exeter Medical School, found people who were severely deficient were up to 125 per cent more at risk of dementia or Alzheimer’s.

Those with moderately low blood levels of vitamin D were up to two-thirds more at risk.

It is the first large study to investigate the relationship between vitamin D and dementia where the diagnosis was made by an expert team using neuroimaging and other tests.

Previous research suggests people with low vitamin D levels are more likely to go on to experience cognitive problems, but this study confirms a link to a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.

The team studied 1,658 Americans aged 65 and over who were able to walk unaided and were free from dementia, cardiovascular disease and stroke.

The participants were then followed for six years to see who went on to develop Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.

Those who were moderately deficient in vitamin D had a 53 per cent increased risk of developing dementia of any kind, and the risk increased to 125 per cent in severely deficient people.

Similar results were recorded for Alzheimer’s disease, with the moderately deficient group 69 per cent more likely to develop this type of dementia, jumping to a 122 per cent increased risk for those severely deficient.

It found a link with higher dementia rates when vitamin D levels fell to the lowest level, as well as a threshold for good health.

The findings show when blood levels fall below 50 nanomol (nmol) of vitamin per liter of serum, the risk starts to increase.

Vitamin D levels above 50 nmol/L are most strongly associated with good brain health, says the study published in the journal Neurology.

Dr Llewellyn said: “We expected to find an association between low Vitamin D levels and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, but the results were surprising – we actually found that the association was twice as strong as we anticipated.

‘Clinical trials are now needed to establish whether eating foods such as oily fish or taking vitamin D supplements can delay or even prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.

‘We need to be cautious and our latest results do not demonstrate that low vitamin D levels cause dementia.

Trials: Almost 2,000 elderly people were surveyed by the University of Exeter Medical School for six years

‘That said, our findings are very encouraging, and even if a small number of people could benefit, this would have enormous public health implications given the devastating and costly nature of dementia.’

The body makes most of its vitamin D from sunlight on the skin, but older people can be less efficient at converting UV exposure.

Although the vitamin is found in oily fish, and is routinely added to milk, diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream.

Prof Gordon Wilcock, Emeritus Professor of Geratology, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, said ‘This study confirms the suggestion from previous research that there is a link between low vitamin D levels and the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.

Action: Researchers urge health officials to prioritise treatment trials in people with low levels of vitamin D to see if supplements could prevent the onset

‘It emphasises the need for treatment trials in people with low levels of vitamin D to see if supplements could prevent or delay the onset of dementia, or improve memory function after it has deteriorated.

‘One could make a case for checking vitamin D levels in older people who have a poor diet, or who have little exposure to the sun, or alternatively as a part of an older persons’ routine screening programme, because vitamin D is important for other health reasons as well as memory problems and dementia.

‘Dementia is such a devastating disease that preventing or slowing down its progression, if this proves possible with vitamin D supplements, would be extremely important even if the number of people who benefited seems small.’

Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at Alzheimer’s Society charity, said ‘During this hottest of summers, hitting the beach for just 15 minutes of sunshine is enough to boost your vitamin D levels.

‘However, we’re not quite ready to say that sunlight or vitamin D supplements will reduce your risk of dementia.

‘Large scale clinical trials are needed to determine whether increasing vitamin D levels in those with deficiencies can help prevent dementia from developing.’

Dr Simon Ridley, Head of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK charity, said the research showed a link between low vitamin D and dementia, but not that it was the cause.

‘To be certain whether increasing vitamin D could help protect against dementia, we would need to see large-scale clinical trials. ‘Anyone who is considering changing their diet to include vitamin supplements should speak to a doctor.

‘In the meantime, there are a number of ways people can lower their risk of dementia, including eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly, not smoking or drinking too much, and keeping blood pressure and weight in check.’
