This is the tragic human face of the deadly car bomb blasts that ripped across Iraq in one of the deadliest attacks since U.S. troops withdrew from the country.

For many, yesterday's 20 explosions that killed 80 people will have passed unnoticed - seen as just another chapter in the nation's tumultuous recent history.

But for Karim Hamid the tragedy is very real - evident in these graphic pictures as he cradles the corpse of his dead seven-month-old nephew Morteda Faleh.

Co-ordinated: The explosions struck mainly Shiite pilgrims in several cities - a stark reminder of political tensions that once threatened to provoke a new round of sectarian violence

The infant was slaughtered, alongside his father, mother, brother and sister in one of the car bomb attacks to strike Baghdad.

The co-ordinated explosions struck 
mainly Shiite pilgrims in several cities - a stark reminder of political
tensions that once threatened to provoke a new round of sectarian 
violence.

It is this bloodshed that could once again push the country to the brink of civil war.

The pilgrims were headed to the northern Baghdad neighborhood of Kazimiyah to mark the anniversary of the death of a revered Shiite saint who is interred there.

Devastation: A series of car bomb blasts killed at least 63 people across Iraq today

Horrific: It was one of the deadliest attacks since U.S. troops withdrew from the country

The first bomb struck a procession at 
around 5am in the town of Taji, north of Baghdad, killing seven people 
and wounding two, police said.

That was followed by four more 
morning blasts that hit other groups of pilgrims across the capital, 
killing 30 people and wounding more than 70.

‘A
group of pilgrims were walking and passed by a tent offering food and 
drinks when suddenly a car exploded near them,’ said Wathiq Muhana, a 
policeman whose patrol was stationed near the blast in central Karrada 
district.  

‘People were running away covered with blood and bodies were scattered on the ground.’

South of Baghdad, two car bombs exploded minutes apart at dawn in the centre of the city of Hillah, killing 22 people and wounding 53. 

‘When a minibus packed with policemen stopped near the restaurants, a car exploded near the bus,’ said Maitham Sahib, owner of a restaurant in Hilla near the blast. ‘It’s heart breaking. It is just sirens, and screams of wounded people.’            

A parked car bomb also exploded near a group of pilgrims in the Shiite holy city of Karbala, 55 miles south of Baghdad, at about 8am, killing two people and wounding 22 others.

Two nearly simultaneous car bombs also killed seven pilgrims and wounded 34 in the Shiite town of Balad, 50 miles north of Baghdad.

Blasts: The attacks were the third this week targeting the annual pilgrimage

Another person was killed in the northern city of Kirkuk when three more bombs exploded, one of them outside the political office of a prominent ethnic Kurdish leader.

The attacks were the third this week targeting the annual pilgrimage that sees hundreds of thousands of Shiites converge on Baghdad on foot to commemorate the 8th century death of revered Imam Moussa al-Kadhim.

Baghdad military command spokesman Col. Dhia al-Wakeel said the attacks meant to reignite all-out sectarian bloodshed.

He added: 'But Iraqis are fully aware of the terrorism agenda and will not slip into a sectarian conflict.'

Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks but they bore the hallmarks of Sunni insurgents who frequently target Shiite pilgrimages in Iraq.
