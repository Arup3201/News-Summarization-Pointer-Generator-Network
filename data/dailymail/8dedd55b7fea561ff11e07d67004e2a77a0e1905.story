A new documentary about the deadly Trans World Airline Flight 800 featuring interviews with former investigators claims that the official explanation given for the ill-fated flight is wrong.

The flight crashed off the coast of Long Island in 1996, killing all 230 people on board in what is the third-deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history.

The official explanation given by the
 National Transportation Safety Board was that the 
crash was caused by a gas tank explosion, but the documentary gives 'solid proof' there was an external detonation, its co-producer said.

Many eye-witnesses claimed they had seen a streak of fire heading towards the plane before it crashed. Theories have suggested it was a missile strike from a terrorist or U.S. Navy 
vessel, and that the incident was subject to a government 
cover-up.

But now the producers of TWA FLIGHT 800, which premieres on July 17, the anniversary of the crash, on cable network EPIX, said they have more than just eye-witness statements to call on.

'Of course, everyone knows about the eyewitness statements, but we also have corroborating information from the radar data, and the radar data shows a(n) asymmetric explosion coming out of that plane - something that didn't happen in the official theory,' Tom Stalcup told CNN's New Day.

He said many witnesses said that there was an external force and 'there's no evidence' of the explosion in the center wing tank. He added that none of the witnesses had been allowed to testify.

The producers have now submitted a petition signed by former investigators calling for the NTSB  to reopen its investigation, based on the new evidence, Stalcup told CNN.

Among the whistle-blowers who worked on the investigation are Hank Hughes, a senior accident investigator, Bob Young, a TWA investigator, and Jim Speer, an accident investigator for the Airline Pilots Association.

'We weren’t allowed to talk about the TWA 800 investigation when we were inside,' Young said. 'We had to retire first. That took a while.

'What [witnesses] told us doesn’t fit the mechanical failure scenario that was presented to the public at the end of our investigation.'

'The very next day [after the crash], the FBI came to speak to me and said, "you did not see that, you saw nothing",' one investigator said.

The documentary features interviews 
with these key members of the original investigation team, who now claim
 that their investigation was systematically undermined.

'This
 team of investigators who actually handled the wreckage and victims' 
bodies, prove that the officially proposed fuel-air explosion did not 
cause the crash,' said the film's producers.

'They also provide radar and forensic
 evidence proving that one or more ordinance explosions outside the 
aircraft caused the crash.'

The whistleblower team claim that at 
the time they were placed under a gag order by the NTSB, which they 
charged falsified the official conclusion of the cause of the crash, 
reports Fox News.

However, the statement said they did not speculate about the source or sources of any ordinance explosions.

The deadly crash occurred just 12 minutes after take-off from JFK International Airport on the flight bound for Paris, France.

Officials have dismissed allegations of a cover-up, saying evidence strongly points to their conclusion

More than 600 people gave eye-witness 
accounts after seeing the plane crash and the majority described seeing a
 ‘rising streak of light’ moments before the crash' which many believed 
was a missile hitting the plane.

Many witnesses to the accident had 
seen a 'streak of light' that was usually described as ascending, moving
 to a point where a large fireball appeared, with several witnesses 
reporting that the fireball split in two as it descended toward the 
water.

There was intense public interest in 
these witness reports and much speculation that the reported streak of 
light was a missile that had struck TWA 800, causing the airplane to 
explode.

These witness accounts were a major reason for the initiation 
and duration of the FBI's criminal investigation.

Approximately 80 FBI agents conducted 
interviews with potential witnesses daily. They conducted a 16-month 
investigation and concluded that there was no evidence to indicate that 
any criminal act occurred.

The NTSB told CNN that it was aware of the documentary and that the producers intend to file a petition to reopen the investigation.

'As required by NTSB regulation, a petition for reconsideration of board findings ... must be based on the discovery of NEW evidence or on a showing that the board's findings are erroneous,' NTSB spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in a statement.

The documentary - TWA FLIGHT 800 – premieres on July 17, the anniversary of the crash, at 8PM ET on cable network EPIX.
