Defiant: Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg has said his countrymen refused to be afraid of violence and would respond to the attacks with 'more democracy'

Norway's prime minister struck a defiant tone today saying the response to twin attacks that have rocked his country will be 'more democracy'.

Jens Stoltenberg said Norwegians would defend themselves by showing they were not afraid of violence and by participating more broadly in politics.

The vicious attacks on Friday have left the normally placid Norwegians appalled and shaky, but determined to get on with their lives.

Mr Stoltenberg said: 'It's absolutely possible to have an open, democratic, inclusive society, and at the same time have security measures and not be naive.'

Norwegian police have used a sonar boat to recover belongings from the bottom of the lake where a mass shooting took place on Friday.

Officers are still gathering evidence after 68 people were shot dead on Utoya Island during a 90-minute rampage by a lone gunman.

Speaking at a press conference, senior police said two officers and eight special forces officers went to the island after the alert was raised.

Officers described hearing constant gunfire after arriving at the island, near Sundvollen.

Anders Behring Breivik, who has confessed to the attacks, was arrested 'in the normal way' with his hands up, they told the media.

After checking there was only one gunman, police then began an evacuation of more than 600 people.

'We are proud and humbled by everybody who helped on Utoya Island,' they said.

'The police did a remarkable job on the island and afterwards.'

The leader of Norway's Delta Force defended the special operations team, saying the breakdown of a boat did not cause significant delay to reaching the island.

Police have come under scrutiny over how long it took them to get to the scene. Although the island is just 25 miles from Oslo, it was 90 minutes before officers arrived.

Officers were already dealing with the widespread damage from the fertiliser bomb in the downtown government quarter which Breivik claims to have detonated.

When word of the shooting came, they drove rather than take a helicopter because the crew of the only aircraft available was on holiday.

At least 76 people were killed in the shooting at a youth camp and a bomb attack in the government quarter in Oslo.

Breivik claimed to have carried out the attacks because he was trying to save the Western world from Muslim colonisation.

Norwegian media are suggesting that police knew Breivik's identity even before they reach the island after tracing him through a rental car company from which he hired the panel van where the bomb was planted.

Dag Andre Johansen, chief executive of Avis, said Breivik had rented two vehicles, including a Volkswagen Crafter van.

Fascist: A copy of the 1,500-page manifesto Breivik emailed to 250 UK contacts before carrying out the attacks. Claims he was in contact with the far-right EDL have been denied by police

It comes after two security scares in the capital Oslo this morning.

The Oslo Sentral train station was evacuated because of a suspicious suitcase left on a airport-bound bus. Police later said nothing suspicious was found in the suitcase.

Police were also hunting a 'dangerous' individual who had been released from prison on Monday and had claimed to be associated with Breivik. He was later revealed not to be connected to the suspected mass-murderer.

Detectives acted quickly to deny claims Breivik had been in close contact with the fascist English Defence League before carrying out the attacks.

Yesterday, it was revealed he had labelled the group as 'a blessing' and wrote online of his desire to attend rallies.

Anti-fascist group Searchlight claimed Breivik was in touch with the EDL's Norwegian counterpart, the NDL, using the pseudonym Sigurd Jorsalfare after the 12 century King of Norway who led one of the Crusades.

But the EDL has insisted that it has never had 'any official contact' with him and that there is no evidence that he registered as a supporter on the EDL Facebook page.

A rambling 1,500-page manifesto written over nine years by Breivik was sent to 250 UK contacts just 90 minutes before he began his attack, a Belgian MP has also revealed.

The document was sent to 1,003 email addresses at 2.09pm on Friday and, according to anti-Muslim party Vlaams Belang MP Tanguy Veys, around a quarter of those were UK-based.

He told The Guardian: 'I think the UK was the biggest group. There were people from Italy, France, Germany... but the UK was the biggest number.'

Suspect: Breivik claimed to have carried out the attacks to free the Western world from 'Islamification'

Police officially released the first four names of victims yesterday.

Denmark said today that a 43-year-old national, Hanne Balch Fjalestad, had died in the attacks - the first confirmed foreign death.

She was working as a medic on the island and leaves behind four children, including a 20-year-old daughter Anna who survived the shooting.

Many of those killed were involved in the governing Labour Party, which suspects Breivik was against allowing Muslims to immigrate to Norway.

Police identified Gunnar Linakar, 23, a regional secretary of the party's youth wing which organised the camp, and three victims of the bombing: Tove Aashill Knutsen, 56, Hanna M. Orvik Endresen, 61, and Kai Hauge, 33.
