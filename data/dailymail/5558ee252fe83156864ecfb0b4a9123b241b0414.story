Energetic: Jim Murphy, 47, is credited with helping to deliver a No vote in last week’s referendum after he launched a tour of 100 Scottish towns in 100 days

Jim Murphy is being lined up to take on Nicola Sturgeon at the next Holyrood election in a bid to revive Labour’s fortunes in Scotland.

Westminster bosses want the former Scottish Secretary, currently Shadow International Development Secretary, to run for First Minister at the 2016 Holyrood election.

There is disquiet in the party about the performance of current Scottish leader Johann Lamont in the wake of the Yes campaign’s victories in Labour’s heartlands of Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire. 

Insiders claim she may not be leader by the next election. That would offer Mr Murphy the opportunity to stand for the leadership while still an MP – like Alex Salmond did with the SNP in 2004 – and then switch to the Scottish parliament.

Mr Murphy is also likely to take control of the party’s campaign in Scotland at next May’s General Election.

One Westminster source said he could be appointed Shadow Scottish Secretary at Ed Miliband’s next reshuffle, replacing Margaret Curran.

Mr Murphy, a Blairite who represents East Renfrewshire, was a close ally of Mr Miliband’s brother David and he is unlikely to get his dream job of Foreign Secretary if Ed becomes Prime Minister.

But party sources said Mr Miliband recognises the pivotal role Mr Murphy played in the referendum and would be happy to work with him as Scottish leader.

Mr Murphy, 47, is credited with helping to deliver a No vote in last week’s referendum after he launched a tour of 100 towns in 100 days, speaking to thousands from a platform of Irn-Bru crates.

He was forced to temporarily postpone the tour after being pelted with eggs but swiftly returned to the fray.

Meanwhile, recriminations have started in Scottish Labour over the poll results in Glasgow and surrounding areas.

One insider said the Holyrood party was ‘dysfunctional’ and had still not recovered from its 2011 Scottish election humiliation, which saddled the backbenches with ‘dead wood’.

One high-profile Labour politician said: ‘I have never been so grateful for the Tories. They got their supporters out in middle-class areas and saved the Union, while our people were switching to Yes.

‘For the first time ever, I was so happy the turnouts in the schemes were lower than elsewhere.’

Although Glasgow narrowly voted Yes, the turnout was only 75 per cent – the lowest in the country.

But it is still very concerning for Labour that the Yes camp won with 53.49 per cent in Glasgow, 51.07 per cent in North Lanarkshire and 53.96 per cent in West Dunbartonshire.

In Miss Lamont’s own seat of Glasgow Pollok, the Yes vote was 53.9 per cent.

Stiff opposition: Mr Murphy in Musselburgh High Street during his 100 town tour, where he was angrily heckled by a Tesco supermarket worker who spoke out in support of independence for Scotland

Across the country, a poll published by Lord Ashcroft last Friday suggests that 37 per cent of Scots who backed Labour in 2011 voted for separation.

Labour did have some politicians who excelled, most notably Gordon Brown.

Heir apparent: Nicola Sturgeon looks likely to lead the Scottish National Party into the 2016 elections to the regional assembly at Holyrood, Edinburgh

His future is unclear and he has still to decide if he will run again for his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat next year. 

Better Together leader Alistair Darling was asked about his future at the weekend and said: ‘I am going to be making my mind up over the next couple of weeks or so. It would be a huge decision for me, whatever I decide to do.’

One Westminster insider said: ‘After those two, Jim Murphy is the stand-out performer. He is one of the best Scottish politicians for a generation and Ed has a huge degree of respect for what he did.’

The source added: ‘There are questions being asked about Margaret Curran. What did she do? She’s a street fighter, she could have been touring cities and towns. And many people don’t expect Johann to still be leading the party in Scotland in 2016.’

Mr Murphy would need to find a new seat to contest for the Holyrood election, as the MSP for the corresponding constituency – Ken Macintosh – is a close ally who he would want as part of his team.

Glasgow Central MP Anas Sarwar is currently deputy leader of Scottish Labour but if Mr Murphy replaces Miss Lamont, his deputy would need to come from Holyrood.

Rising stars such as Kezia Dugdale, Drew Smith and Jenny Marra would be favourite for this job.
