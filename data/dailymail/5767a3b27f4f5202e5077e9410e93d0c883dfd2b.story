Formula One magnate Bernie Ecclestone is facing the prospect of extradition after being indicted by a German court on bribery charges.

The 82-year-old billionaire could be jailed for five years if convicted.

Prosecutors allege that a £26million payment by the motorsport boss to German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky was made to ensure that a large stake of Formula One was sold below its true value in 2006 to Mr Ecclestone’s preferred bidder.

Mr Ecclestone, left, had been under investigation since former German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky, right, was convicted of corruption for receiving payments from the motor racing chief executive in connection with the sale of shares in the sport in 2006

But he denies the sum was  a bribe, 
instead claiming he  was being blackmailed by the banker over untrue tax
allegations that could have cost him ‘billions’.

Gribkowsky was jailed for accepting the payment and is serving an eight-and-a-half year sentence.

Mr Ecclestone gave evidence during the
banker’s trial, admitting that he gave him large sums of money, but 
denied doing anything illegal.

Now he has been served with an 
indictment by a German judge, and will either have to answer voluntarily
to the charges or be threatened with extradition.

Mr Ecclestone’s team is planning to 
send a response to the judge within the next few weeks. After the 
defence has been weighed against the prosecution case, the judge will 
decide whether to summon him for a court hearing.

Court action: The tycoon's legal team will submit a response within the next few weeks and prosecutors will then decide whether Mr Ecclestone could face trial

He strenuously denies the allegation –
but questions are being raised over whether he can continue his 
dominance of motor racing as Formula One’s chief executive with the 
charges hanging over him.

Mr Ecclestone told the Financial Times
yesterday: ‘I have just spoken to my lawyers and they have received an 
indictment. It’s being translated into English. We are defending it 
properly. It will be an interesting case. It’s a pity it’s happened.’

Mr Ecclestone said it was ‘inevitable’
that the indictment had been issued against him, saying: ‘If someone 
wants to sue you, they can do it and you have to defend it.’

Gribkowsky is alleged to have received
the £26million during a huge sale of Formula One shares in 2006. He 
worked for state-owned Bayerisches Landesbank, which was selling its 48 
per cent share in the motor racing company, and he was a major figure in
arranging the sale.

At his trial in Munich in 2011, the 
disgraced banker admitted corruptly receiving bank commissions and large
payments from an Ecclestone family trust.

Big business: Mr Ecclestone had claimed that the £29million payment was to avoid a UK tax inquiry into the sale of Formula One in 2006 and vehemently denied that they were bribes

He claimed the cash was in return for 
ensuring the shares were sold to CVC, a private equity firm, because it 
would keep Mr Ecclestone as the controller of Formula One.

But the motorsport boss insisted he 
had been ‘pressured’ into paying because Gribkowsky had threatened to 
make false allegations to the UK taxman that an Ecclestone family trust 
in the tax haven of Lichtenstien was fully in Bernie’s control.

Mr Ecclestone claims he did not have control of the trust, so was not evading tax.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
