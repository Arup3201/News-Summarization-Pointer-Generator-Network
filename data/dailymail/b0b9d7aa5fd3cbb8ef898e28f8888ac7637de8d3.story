Swansea are poised to sign Kyle Naughton from Tottenham for around £4million.

The defender has also attracted interest from Leicester but Swansea, poised for a windfall from Manchester City on Wilfried Bony's transfer, have matched Tottenham's valuation.

Naughton, 26, has been pushed further down the pecking order with the arrival of DeAndre Yedlin from Seattle Sounders who trained with his new teammates on Wednesday and will wear the number 12 shirt.

West Bromwich Albion remain interested in a deal for Aaron Lennon but Tottenham do not wish to sell Andros Townsend following his return to form.

Townsend said: 'The club want me here and I want to be here. I'm a Spurs boy. I've been at the club since the age of eight so as long as I'm in the team, as I have been over the last few weeks, I'm not looking to go anywhere.'
