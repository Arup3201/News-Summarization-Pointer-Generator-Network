Officers have spent two days combing the property and its garden for clues as the hunt for the 16-year-old intensified.

Two officers guarded the door to the terraced house a mile from Becky’s home.

The 5ft 4in GCSE student was last seen by her stepmother, before leaving home with a bag containing her mobile phone and laptop.

She left without money or a change of clothes and police have had no positive sightings of her since. Her family did not report her missing for 28 hours.

Becky’s father Darren Galsworthy, 51, and stepmother Angie-Mae, 49, said her disappearance is ‘totally out of character’ and they ‘fear the worst’ as each day passes.

Two people were arrested on Saturday in connection with the disappearance but police refused to reveal their identity, age or gender. 

A neighbour  said they thought the garden was being dug up and added the house is home to a family

Last night, both individuals were still in police custody. It is not known what link, if any, they have to the property in Southmead, in the north of Bristol, which was being searched.

Neighbours said the property was privately rented by a family with two or three children who are reportedly staying in a nearby hotel.

Detectives carried out house-to-house inquiries in the street and showed residents photographs of Becky in the hope of jogging their memories.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said they believed the garden of the house was being dug up. 

It took four officers to lift the unidentified large object into a police van before it was taken away

Meanwhile officers from five police forces were scouring a nature reserve, cemetery, allotments and parks within a 1.2-mile radius of her family home.

Experts from the National Crime Agency, the College of Policing and the charity Missing People have been drafted in. Specialist sniffer dogs from South Wales Police are also being used.

Becky’s family home, to the east of Bristol town centre, has been searched by forensic officers for five days.

On Saturday they removed a barrel-shaped object from the property, larger than the bin-like item taken from the house in Southmead.

In a statement her father and stepmother, who are living in a safe house, said: ‘We continue to hope that she will be found safe and unharmed but we will prepare ourselves for the worst.’

Becky’s stepmother was the last person to see her when she came home at around 10.30am on February 19 after staying with a friend the night before.

The teenager had a shower and changed her clothes before leaving wearing a blue puffa-style jacket at around 11.15am. 

Her family thought she had gone to meet her boyfriend Luke Oberhansli, 17, that day. But she did not reply to messages or return that evening and they called police at 4pm the next day.

Her uncle Joe Galsworthy, who organised two searches for Becky last week, said of the two arrests: ‘It hasn’t exactly filled us with confidence but it has in no way, shape or form dampened our spirits or hope that we will find Becky safe and well… I hope and pray that she makes a safe return.’

Detective Superintendent Liz Tunks, leading the investigation, said the hunt ‘continues unabated’.
