Mauricio Pochettino defended Tottenham’s post-season trip to Australia and insists it stands them in good stead to launch an attack on the top four.

Spurs will face Sydney FC in Australia on May 30, a week after this campaign finishes. 

The decision appears to weaken the club’s stance regarding potential burnout of Harry Kane and the manager held talks with Under 21 boss Gareth Southgate on Wednesday.

But Pochettino is adamant that the trip Down Under will be beneficial, giving his squad an edge in the race for Champions League qualification.

‘It was my decision. It’s important because we’re trying to avoid going on tour during pre-season,’ Pochettino said.

‘It’s never proper for the team to go to Asia or America at the beginning of the season to spend time doing commercial business.’

Tottenham will spend their pre-season at home and are planning to play a series of one-off friendlies rather than join the cluster of Premier League clubs who prefer to train abroad.

‘I’ve had bad experiences of tours, when you’re going far away,’ Pochettino added. ‘Experiences as a player helps as a manager. It can upset your preparations.’
