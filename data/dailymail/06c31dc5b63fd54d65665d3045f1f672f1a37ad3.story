Ian Thorpe's manager has slammed reports the Australian swimming great risks losing the use of his left arm but confirmed he is battling a 'serious' infection in a Sydney hospital.

James Erskine told Channel 9's Today the Olympic legend 'looks like the bionic man' after he contracted an infection post shoulder surgery in Switzerland.

Grave fears are held for the Australian sporting icon, 31, after reports emerged the complication could lead to the loss of use in his left arm.

'If you saw him he’s in good spirits, he’s got drips and antibiotics, drains all that kind of thing so he’s not exactly going to swim in the Commonwealth Games tomorrow,' Erskine told Today.

'I saw him yesterday he’s not in intensive care, he’s a sick boy, he’s not going to get out, roam around and have cups of coffee or meet Prince William in the next day.

'He’s fighting it, he’s got an infection. He’s battling, he’s unlucky and how long it’s going to take to clear up I don’t know.

'There have  been some very serious consequences of these infections and he’s aware of that and that’s why he’s getting the best treatment.'

Erskine said rumours of the gold medalist suffering paralysis in his left arm were 'poetic licence' and 'just nonsense'. 

Thorpe is receiving treatment after undergoing surgery at a hospital near his Swiss home of Ronco sopra Ascona.

A hospital-acquired infection usually first appears three days after admission to a hospital or other health care facility.

The infection, which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites, may develop from surgical procedures, catheters in the urinary tract or blood vessels or from material in the air which is inhaled into the lungs.

These micro-organisms may already be present in the patient's body or come from the environment, contaminated hospital equipment, healthcare workers or other patients.

Common hospital infections are MRSA and C Difficile.

Sometimes the infection can have devastating results and require a limb to be amputated, if the infection cannot be treated.

Some of the common causes of infections are when the hospital: Fails to carry out routine pre-screening for MRSA or C-Difficile prior to surgery; delays in identifying and treating the infection when it has been acquired; fails to treat or monitor the infection appropriately, to provide basic medical care and post-surgical treatment or a clean and safe environment.

Thorpe was flown to Sydney, where he is in intensive care, and yesterday Network Seven reported that he could lose the use of his left arm. 

The troubled swimmer spent time in a rehab facility in February, where he was treated for depression and painkillers after he was found walking around a Sydney street dazed and disoriented.

His management claimed Thorpe had been taking the painkillers due to a shoulder operation earlier in the year.

Ian Thorpe contracted the latest infection after having shoulder surgery in Australia, Thorpe’s onetime coach, Gennadi Touretski told a Swiss news outlet.

Touretski, who prepared the swimmer for his failed 2011 comeback, said he was confident Thorpe would recover from the shoulder infection, but he needed to beat ‘the worse evil – his depression’.

He said when he last saw Thorpe in December, he had completely lost interest in swimming.

Touretski had advised him to play tennis. ‘He absolutely needs to find something that can replace swimming in his life,’ the coach told Ticino News.

Touretski said he was convinced Thorpe would make a full recovery, and hoped there would be a happy ending of this ‘stormy period’.

‘Ian has to protect himself , he must find his angel to guard him ,' said Touretski.

‘The fact that so many people care about him, can only be good for him.

‘This infection will pass, I'm sure. But [he needs to defeat] the worse evil, his depression.’

This morning Thorpe's former Olympic swimming teammate Michal Klim tweeted: 'Sending my thoughts + best wishes to @IanThorpe in overcoming his health issues. Draw on the past that made you our best athlete of all time.'

The five-time Olympic gold medallist has had a difficult time since his glory days at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

Thorpe revealed in his 2013 autobiography, This Is Me: The Autobiography, that he has been battling ‘crippling depression’ for more than a decade. 

In the book, Thorpe wrote about how he had at times considered suicide and confessed to drinking huge quantities of alcohol to deal with his depression.

Despite an ill-fated attempt to qualify for the 2012 Olympics, Thorpe wanted to continue swimming and had been training as recently as August 2013.

He had hoped to gain selection in Australia’s Commonwealth Games team to compete in Scotland this year but a shoulder injury ruined his chances and he conceded that his career was over.

Shortly after London 2012 he moved to Switzerland, but returned to Australia in December last year.

Thorpe had yet to decide on a 
post-swimming career but he made a very successful foray into commentary
 with the BBC at the London Olympics.

Thorpe’s
 manager, James Erskine, told the ABC in February: ‘He made the decision
 [last year] that he would give up competitive swimming. There is plenty
 of things to do in life after swimming. He loves cooking, travel, and 
is a natural for television.

‘[He needs to find something that will] give him the same type of satisfaction [as swimming].

‘There
 wouldn’t be an Australian who is living today who hasn’t got the pride 
and joy of seeing Ian Thorpe swimming and winning gold medals, and who 
wouldn’t wish him well,’ Mr Erskine added.
