John Cantlie, the British hostage being held by ISIS, has been used in a new slickly-produced video released by the insurgents in which he admits that he is likely to be executed.

The photojournalist, who was captured last year while working in Syria, is seen addressing the camera in the propaganda video as he also reveals details of an apparent botched U.S. raid to rescue him and his fellow captives. 

In the lecture-style footage, titled Lend Me Your Ears Episode 6, Mr Cantlie appears to be reading from a prepared script as he sits behind a desk wearing an orange jumpsuit.

It is the seventh video that ISIS has released that shows the British hostage. 

The clip, which lasts for almost nine minutes, opens with the 43-year-old photojournalist giving an account of what he claims was a failed rescue attempt by American forces on July 4 - American Independence Day. 

He goes on to say that he has 'accepted' that he will suffer the 'same fate' as his executed cellmates but that he blames the British and American governments and not the insurgents, who he refers to as the mujahideen.

Asked about this latest video, Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of a further video and are analysing its contents.' 

It comes just days after a video purporting to show the severed head of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig and a mass murder of Syrian soldiers emerged.

Since August, IS has filmed and posted online the deaths of four Western hostages. British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were beheaded on camera by the jihadi organisation.

In the most recent video from the militants, which has been posted online, Mr Cantlie looks gaunt as he delivers his lecture from inside a dark room.

He begins by saying: 'In this programme I will tell you about a failed raid to rescue us and how it feels to be left for dead by your own government.'

It marks a departure from the last video of Mr Cantlie - released last month - which saw him being used as a news reporter from the battle-ravaged city of Kobane. 

In this latest clip, the sixth in the apparent 'series', Mr Cantlie said that he accepts he will most likely face the same fate as his cellmates, but says he blames David Cameron and President Obama

In the latest clip, Mr Cantlie goes on to claim that the Americans staged an 'incredibly complex, risky and expensive' attempt to rescue hostages in July.

He said: 'The raid involved two dozen Delta Force commandos, several Black Hawk helicopters, gunships, Predator drones, F18 Hornet Jets and refuelling aircraft.

'It took weeks of rehearsals and must have cost tens of millions to perform - but we weren't there.

'The Islamic State, anticipating such a move, just put us into cars and moved us to another prison days beforehand.'  

He also admits that he 'long ago' 'accepted' that his fate will be 'overwhelmingly the same as his cellmates'.

But while he says that he blames Prime Minister David Cameron and President Obama for his situation - not his captors.

He also claims that the leaders knew he was being held hostage for 'more than a year' and added that they were aware that they could be beheaded.  

He claimed that the leaders are 'treating their lives like a gamble, like a roll of the dice,' and said that their actions felt like the 'ultimate betrayal'

He said: 'Obama and Cameron act all shocked and appalled each time one of us is killed but they have known this was coming for months. 

'They have known our six names, who was holding us, and the consequences of not negotiating for over a year. 

'So for them to act all shocked each time one of us is executed is a massive lie to the public and our families.

'Long ago I accepted that my fate would be overwhelmingly the same as my cellmates and I am angry about it.'

He claimed that the leaders are 'treating their lives like a gamble, like a roll of the dice,' and said that their actions felt like the 'ultimate betrayal'. 

He also accuses Britain and America of taking military action rather than negotiating the release of hostages through options such as ransom payments.

He says: 'We were left to die. It's the worse feeling in the world being left behind like that. 

'We have been in the longest, paid our dues, watched everyone else go home, never stopped believing and wham! Have some of that. You're not worth negotiating for.'

He focuses on the French government's record for paying out ransom demands, stating that 'since 2008, France has reportedly paid $58 million of ransom payments to different Islamic groups, nearly 10 million a year.'

The British journalist comments: 'Wouldn't it be cheaper to release the Muslim prisoners as asked?'

He also raises the case of Bowe Robert Bergdahl, a US Army soldier who was held captive by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network in Afghanistan from June 2009 until his release in May 2014. 

Mr Cantlie says: 'He was one man. We were six and Islamic State asked for Muslim prisoners in exchange for all of us. Yes, Bergdahl was a soldier and three of us were British but a civilian live, all six of them, not worth discussing?' 

He added: 'We are not big people. We are not special. We are not US soldiers. But we are no more less important than everyone else who went home.'

The footage, seen above, marks a departure from the fifth video that was released of Mr Cantlie, which saw him being used as a news reporter from the battle-ravaged city of Kobane

Towards the end of the video, he says: 'I will continue to speak out against this military action ... for as long as the mujahideen allow me to live.' 

It is not the first time Mr Cantlie's experience in journalism has been utilised by ISIS, as last month his name was put to an article which appeared in a propaganda magazine designed to inflame the feelings of IS followers.

This is the seventh video to feature Mr Cantlie and comes after his sister said last month that she thinks he believes 'two-thirds' of what he says on camera.

Jessica Cantlie also made an emotional appeal for her brother's return, pleading with the terrorists to reopen lines of contact to secure his safe journey home. 

She has also previously appealed for 'direct contact' with the militants holding him.

Last month Mr Cantlie's father died following a public appeal from his hospital bed.

Paul Cantlie, 80, spoke directly to ISIS extremists in a heartfelt video, pleading for his son's return. He died from complications following pneumonia last month. 

Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen today denounced the Islamic State group for declaring a caliphate on territory it seized in Syria and Iraq without the correct mandate.

Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari, who claims to be the groups spiritual guide said their actions are 'driving a wedge' among jihadi groups. 

The clip emerged as the Islamic State released a seventh propaganda video showing British hostage John Cantlie. 

Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari was referring to Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's recent call for followers to 'explode volcanos of jihad everywhere.'

Al-Nadhari said ISIS "forced the nation, all the nation, to pledge allegiance' in absence of 'consultation' with other Jihadi leaders. 

His message was posted on one of Yemeni Al-Qaida's official Twitter pages.

He said: 'They revoked the legitimacy of all the Islamic groups across the Islamic world .... and drove a wedge among Mujahedeen ranks by collecting allegiances from within the Jihadi groups.

'They announced the expansion of their caliphate in a number of countries in which they have no mandate.'

The Islamic State extremists initially fought to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. But other groups, including al-Qaeda central command, disavowed them.

Smaller groups across the region have pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi while the larger al-Qaeda affiliates remain silent regarding al-Baghdadi's outreach. Among the more significant loyalty pledges came from Egypt's Ansar Beit al-Maqdis.

The U.S. considers al-Qaida in Yemen to be one of the most dangerous local branches of the global terror organization because it has been linked to several failed attacks on the U.S. homeland.  

The group is led by Nasser al-Wahishi, a onetime close associate to Osama bin Laden. In the video message, al-Nadhari reiterated the group's allegiance to bin Laden's successor Ayman al-Zawahri, in defiance of al-Baghdadi's outreach initiative.
