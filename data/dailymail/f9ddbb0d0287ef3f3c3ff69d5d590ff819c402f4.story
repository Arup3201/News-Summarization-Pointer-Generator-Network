Camille Muffat, an Olympic swimmer who won gold at London 2012 and is a former world record holder, has reportedly died in the helicopter crash

Ten people including two French Olympians who competed at London 2012 have been killed after two helicopters crashed in midair in Argentina on Monday.

Camille Muffat, 25, a swimmer who won gold in the women's 400m freestyle in 2012, Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine, 28, who won bronze in Beijing in 2008, and sailor Florence Arthaud, 58, are all reported to be among the dead.

They perished alongside five other French nationals who are all thought to have been taking part in survival show Dropped, and two Argentine pilots after a horror-crash.

A statement from local government officials identified the remaining victims as Laurent Sbasnik, Lucie Mei-Dalby, Volodia Guinard, Brice Guilbert and Edouard Gilles, as well as Argentine pilots Juan Carlos Castillo and Roberto Abate. 

The accident happened at around 5pm on Monday shortly after the two aircraft took off in a mountainous region of La Rioja, in Argentina's north west.

Rebecca Adlington and Amir Khan were among those to have paid tribute.

Great Britain's two-time Olympic champion Adlington wrote on Twitter of the 25-year-old on Tuesday: 'So sad and shocked to wake up to hear the tragic death of Camille Muffat. She was an amazing sportswoman, competitor and lovely person.

The Swimmer won a Gold, Silver and Bronze medal at London 2012, finishing ahead of Rebecca Adlington to win the 400m freestyle. A former World record holder over 400m and 800m, she was also a World and European champion.

Florence Arthaud, 57

A sailor who won the Route du Rhum in 1990, Arthaud had survived a car crash aged 17 which left her in a coma.

'My thoughts go out to not only all her friends and family but to all the family and friends of all the 10 victims. Its an extremely sad day.

'RIP Olympic Champion Camille Muffat. You will be dearly missed. X'

Twenty-eight-year-old Vastine claimed light welterweight bronze at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, while 57-year-old Arthaud was considered one of the world's best sailors.

Khan, who secured a lightweight silver medal for GB at the 2004 Olympics before going on to become a pro world champion, told Press Association Sport: 'I'm very sad to hear of the passing of Alexis Vastine.

'I had the pleasure of competing against him in the amateurs and would like to send my deepest condolences to all his family and friends during this difficult time.'

Disel Cuneo, government spokesman for the province, said: 'There are several French nationals among the victims. So far we only know of two Argentine victims.'

Another provincial spokesman, Horacio Alarcon, said that the two helicopters appeared to have collided during filming. 'There are no survivors,' he added.

Camille Muffat was a former world record holder for the 400m  women's freestyle from 2012 until 2013.

She won gold during the 400m freestyle at London 2012, earned silver in the women's 200m freestyle, and a bronze as a member of the women's 4×200m freestyle relay. 

She was the third Frenchwoman in history to earn three medals in a summer or winter Olympic Games and was named the 2012 French Sportswoman of the Year. 

It is thought that the two craft crashed into one another during filming for a survival show which was taking place just after 5pm local time

Alexis Vastine won bronze for boxing in the Light Welterweight category at the Beijing Olympics, and competed at London 2012, but was knocked out in the quarter finals.

Florence Arthaud was regarded as one of the world's best sailors, and won the Route du Rhum, a transatlantic single-handed yacht race that takes place every four years. She took first place in 1990 with her boat Pierre 1er. 

Sylvain Wiltord, a 40-year-old former Arsenal footballer who won two Premier League titles and two FA Cups, was in the show, but was not on board either of the helicopters.

Wiltord tweeted early this morning: 'I am sad for my friends, I'm trembling, I'm horrified, I have no words, I don't want to say anything'.

'The brutal demise of our compatriots is an immense sadness,' said French President Francois Hollande in a statement published on the website of the French daily Liberation. 

Irish boxer Paddy Barnes, who also won Bronze in 2008, tweeted of his shock at hearing about Vastine's death. 

The crash happened close to the village of Villa Castelli in the Andes mountain region of La Rioja province

A spokesman for the local government said that weather appeared to have been clear at the time of the crash, adding that there was no further information on what caused the accident

'RIP Alex Vastine! French Olympic boxer who won a bronze medal in Beijing 2008! Trained with him many times, terrible news!' he wrote.

Alain Bernard, 31, and another swimmer who won gold at the London Olympics is also among the show's survivors.

The group were taking part in a French version of the Swedish survival show Dropped, in which athletic celebrities are abandoned in harsh environments and left to survive.

On the website of Zodiak Media, who produce the show, it says: 'With no food, no map, and no help, [contestants] must make their way through unforgiving landscapes, in a race to find civilisation, and a helicopter to take them to the next location. 

'A daily radio message from the show's host is their only indication as to how far they've gone. Each week, the losing team faces an elimination challenge, until only four contestants remain.'

Mr Alarcon said the weather conditions were good and the cause of the crash was unknown.

No further details have been released on the identities of the victims, thought it has been reported by local news stations that one of the pilots was from the province. 

Images on Argentine television showed the wreckage of the two helicopters lying in flames on the barren scrubland.

The helicopters were flying over Quebrada El Yeso and Quebrada Condado, two locations in the mountain region of La Rioja, located 700 miles north of the capital Buenos Aires.

It is thought that one of the vehicles belonged to the regional government, while the other came from the nearby Santiago del Estero province.
