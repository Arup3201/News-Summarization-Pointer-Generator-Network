Hundreds of girls as young  as 11 are taking up boxing in school, inspired by Nicola Adams’s Olympic gold medal.

Teachers and coaches say interest in the controversial sport has surged among both boys and girls, in PE lessons and at after-school clubs.

And the number of women who box at least once a week has rocketed by nearly 8,000 from 23,200 to 35,100, says Sport England.

But many health experts believe children should not be allowed to box due to the injury risk.

Professor Sheila Hollins, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Blows can cause brain injury and, in extreme cases, acute brain haemorrhage, which can lead to death.’

Boxing virtually disappeared from state schools in the 1960s because of safety fears.

But the Schools Amateur Boxing Association (SABA) says more than 1,000 teachers have now been trained to coach lessons, with hundreds of children aged 11 to 18 competing. In four secondary schools in Manchester, about 240 girls are learning boxing in lessons, with at  least 20 signed up for extra-curricular clubs. 

PE teacher Jimmy Barker, a SABA development officer who runs boxing lessons at North Chadderton School, Manchester, said: ‘When I go into schools and mention Nicola Adams as a role model, it draws the girls in.

‘Some of the girls are more enthused than the boys. 

‘In fact, some of the girls are better than the lads. They’re putting more into the lessons.’

Frank Collinson, general secretary of SABA, said the sport is now far safer, with children training by hitting pads on instructor’s hands and wearing protective equipment.
