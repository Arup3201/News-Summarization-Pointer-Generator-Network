Clint Eastwood just made Mitt Romney's day.

The Dirty Harry star and Oscar-winning director of Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby endorsed the Republican presidential candidate Friday night during a Sun Valley, Idaho fundraiser.

'I think the country needs a boost,' Eastwood told The Associated Press as he joined other Romney supporters for the private campaign event.

In February, Eastwood told Fox News that he wasn't supporting any politician at that time.

Some saw the 'halftime in America' ad he made for the Super Bowl as a nod toward President Barack Obama. Eastwood responded then by saying he was not 'politically affiliated' with the president.

'Now more than ever do we need Gov. Romney. I'm going to be voting for him,' Eastwood told Romney supporters Friday night.

'He just made my day,' Romney said. 'What a guy.'

Standing at Romney's side, Eastwood said
he was filming Mystic River in Massachusetts almost a decade ago when 
he first saw political advertisements featuring Romney, who was running 
for governor at the time.

On his own: The endorsement is a blow to Obama, who celebrates his 51st birthday on Saturday

'I said, God, this guy, he's too handsome to be governor, but he does look like he could be president,' Eastwood joked. 'As the years have gone by I began to think even more so about that.'

Eastwood, 82, said he hoped Romney would restore 'a decent tax system that we need badly ... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as who's paying taxes and who isn't.'

The actor and director instantly 
became Romney highest-profile celebrity supporter. Romney has also 
earned the endorsement of Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight and rock star 
Kid Rock.

A campaign spokesman could not immediately say whether Eastwood would play an active role in the campaign.

About 325 people paid as much as $25,000 apiece to attend the event. Eastwood is a part-time resident of Sun Valley.

The high profile endorsement will come as a blow to President Obama, who celebrates his 51st birthday on Saturday - and who received a cheeky cake from the Republicans as a gift.

The Republican National Committee sent him a vanilla frosted cake with the words: 'Happy birthday Mr President. You didn't bake this.'

It refers to Obama's remarks at a campaign stop in Virginia that entrepreneurs need government to help them be successful. 'If you've got a business - you didn't build that,' he said.

'We do know that hard working, smart entrepreneurs across the country join us in wishing the president a happy birthday and hoping that next year he has more time for baking so the country can get back to job creating,' RNC spokesman Tim Miller told Yahoo News.
