In some quarters it was hailed as a victory for computer ‘nerds’ over the world of celebrity.

Music super couple Jay Z and Beyonce were reportedly outbid in their quest to purchase the most expensive mansion in Beverly Hills by the creator of the popular online video game Minecraft.

Markus ‘Notch’ Persson is thought to have paid $70million for the eight-bedroom house, which boasts 15 bathrooms, a 16-car garage, an infinity pool, wine cellar, private theater and a sweet shop.

And now UK web developer - and passionate Minecraft user - Dan Bovey has paid a fitting tribute to the Swedish billionaire's coup, by recreating a stunning video tour of the property in Minecraft itself.

Imitating the real-life promotional video for the property, the Minecraft version walks the viewer through the luxury cliffside compound, mimicking the original in stunningly close detail.

The video swoops over the pool and garden with its panoramic views of Malibu and downtown LA and hovers over the huge infinity pool, before guiding the viewer through the property's lavish interior.

Bovey, who is currently studying Web Development at Staffordshire University, has painstakingly copied the tour with the software that uses individual blocks to create 3D virtual worlds.

It was reported that Beyoncé and Jay Z had their eyes set on the lavish  compound and were reportedly 'on the verge of closing a deal' earlier this month after visiting the home six times.

Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

They
 can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests 
and caves and are 
given blocks and tools to build towns and cities.

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

It is the top online game on Xbox Live, with more than two billion hours played on Xbox 360 in the last two years - and almost 17 million copies sold in total.

In September, Microsoft snapped up Persson's company, Mojang - and the game - for an estimated £1.5billion. 

There is an annual Minecraft convention, Minecon, which is set to continue. 

But according to TMZ,  Persson - who previously sold his company Mojang to Microsoft for $2.5 billion - won the bidding war and bought the impressive home completely furnished, with each of the 15 bathrooms equipped with Toto Neorest toilets at a price of $5,600 each.

Also included in the sale was an 18-foot onyx dining room table for 24 guests with place settings by Roberto Cavalli at a staggering $3,700 each.

TMZ reported that the 33-year-old pop diva and the 45-year-old rap mogul had been 'the frontrunners in a bidding war'.

There were four offers in total on the mansion and real estate agent Branden Williams was previously expected to close the $70 million deal with Bey and Jay 'by Christmas.'

It is unknown what lead to the turn of events, which found Markus closing the deal 'in a lightning-fast six days,' according to real estate brokers John Aaroe Group.

The impressive residence sits on 23,000 square feet and includes an attached 16-car garage and backyard patio with panoramic views of Malibu and downtown LA. 

Even when inside,  views of the the city's landscape are visible from one of the many floor-to-ceiling windows, and fold-able doors off the living room.

The master bedroom features his and hers walk-in closets with plenty of mirrors and storage space for A-List-worthy wardrobes.

Home movies take on a new meaning in a private theatre with seating for 24, while snacking on treats is right at your fingertips with a sweet shop stocked with cascading candy dispensers.

And the grown-ups can store a substantial amount of bottles in the house's large wine cellar, which would have come in handy if the stars ever hosted a party for their famous mates.
