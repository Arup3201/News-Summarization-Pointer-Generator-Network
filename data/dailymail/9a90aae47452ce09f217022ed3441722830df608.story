The father of a firework factory boss started a fire which destroyed his son's warehouse and the stock inside after he tired to make sausages in the building.

Hung Feng, 72, accidentally sparked the blaze after offering to look after the explosives so that his son, Ho Feng, 48, could go out for the evening.

But his well meant gesture turned into a disaster when the elderly man, who used to be a firework maker himself, tried to cook up some sausages inside the building.

Careless: Hung fen sparked the fire when he tried to cook Lap Cheong, a Chinese sausage, in the building

Fireman believe the flame from his stove set alight boxes which in turn sparked the fireworks and destroyed 200 square metres of building.

Speaking after the fire was brought under control, the business owner said his father should have known better, but that he was glad no one was hurt.

Ho said: 'When I left I know that my father told me he was going to cook some Lap Cheong (Chinese sausages) and as he was a firework maker as well it didn't occur to me that I would need to warn him.

Calamity: Feng promised his son Ho Feng, 48, who owns the building, he would watch over it

Ho Feng added: 'It is a tragedy but at least my father escaped, he ran out just as the far started to take hold and was unhurt.'

It took fire crews in Penggang village, 
in Wuhan in Hubei province two hours to bring the blaze under control, 
but not before the entire building had been destroyed by the explosions 
and the intensity of the blaze.

The blaze that destroyed tens of thousands of pounds worth of fireworks gave locals are spectacular two-hour long firework show.

Unwise: Speaking about his dad, Ho Feng said: 'He was a firework maker as well, it didn't occur to me that I would need to warn him.'
