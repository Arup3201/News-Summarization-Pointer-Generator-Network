On a Sunday it seems the Macclesfield-born forward, who also had spells with Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, likes nothing more than a wild photo shoot complete with 'LAD' buzzer.

The former England international posted a picture of himself laying with a baby tiger as Crouch enjoyed some relaxation with Stoke not in action this weekend.

But, the man himself was quick to reassure fans that it was part of an advertising campaign and not just a glimpse of the rock and roll wild child that lies within.

When asked what 'The Lads' buzzer was, Crouch Tweeted that all would be revealed in time...
