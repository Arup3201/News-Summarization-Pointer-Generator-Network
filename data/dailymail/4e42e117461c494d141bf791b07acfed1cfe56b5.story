A 102-year-old woman has been chosen to sit next to Michelle Obama at the annual State of the Union address in Washington.

Desaline Victor, a naturalized U.S citizen from Miami, Florida, waited for more than three hours to cast her ballot for the President on November 6.

Ms Victor will sit in the First Lady’s box with military families, people who are championing immigration reform and victims of gun violence.

Haitian born Ms Victor, who is known as ‘Granny’ in her local community, expressed her surprise at the opportunity.

She said: ‘I know I’m going to sit with the president’s wife. I did not think I would get here. I am proud.’

White House Officials say that Ms Victor represents the minorities and immigrants who stand to benefit from the policies President Obama will discuss in his speech.

She is also a symbol of the thousands of Americans who struggled to vote in November.

Former farm worker, Ms Victor, came to the government’s attention after she waited hours to vote at her local library where people were waiting up to six hours.

She stood in line for three hours before a voting rights activist reported that an elderly woman was struggling on her feet.

After being asked to return later in the evening, she emerged from the polls wearing an ‘I voted’ sticker causing the crowd to erupt into applause.

The White House said that the ‘spirited and independent centenarian’ had encouraged many to continue waiting rather than giving up on voting.

Ms Victor said that all she wanted to do was vote in the election: ‘The line was shorter at night. I wanted to vote for my guy, my son President Obama.’

Philippe Derose, a North Miami Beach councilman said: ‘She said even if she got dizzy or collapsed on the line, ’This is something I have to do.’

President Obama said in ‘we have to fix that’ in reference to the voting wait issue in his election night speech and is expected to address the voting time issue in the State of the Union address.

The State of the Union is a notable point in the political calendar of the United States.

Given by the President, it reports on the condition of the nation and outlines the agenda for the year.

The Constitution forces the President to do this as it serves as a reminder that he reports to Congress and the American people.

The Constitution says: 'He shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.'

Traditionally the President makes this speech in January or February each year of his term.

He also raised the subject in his 
inauguration speech when he said: ‘Our journey is not complete until no 
citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.’

Ms Victor, who arrived in the U.S in 1989, said that she enjoys attending church services and cooking her own meals.

Victims of gun violence have also been invited to the address, including the mother of a victim of the Newtown, Connecticut school massacre.

Lyn McDonnell, mother of Grace, 7, has been asked to attend by Representative Lois Frankel of West Palm Beach.

Grace’s father gave the President one of his daughter’s drawings which he now keeps in his private study.

Obama has described the painting as a reminder of what he has to do to prevent future attacks.

The shooting took the lives of 26 people including 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary school when Adam Lanza opened fire.

Frankel said that gun gun reform is the most important issue of the moment.

She said: ‘The reality is that it’s going to be pressure from the public that’s going to move some of our colleagues, and that’s the reason so many of us are bringing guests from Newtown.

‘I want my colleagues to look these parents in the eye, and tell them that we can get this done, that we can do something. You cannot look these parents in the eye and say “I’m sorry, there’s nothing we can do.” That’s why these folks are going to be there.’

Frankel sits on the Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, proposing several gun control measures including a ban on high capacity magazines.
