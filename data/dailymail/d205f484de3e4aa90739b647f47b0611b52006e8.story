Hackers in China have managed to penetrate the computer networks of the America's top business-lobbying group, it has been claimed.

All the data held by systems at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, including information about its 3million members, are said to have been left vulnerable after the infiltration.

If true, the hack would be one of the boldest attacks yet in what has become an ongoing battle between Chinese hackers and companies and agencies in the U.S.

Hacked: Networks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce were penetrated by hackers suspected to be working for the Chinese government

But the Chinese embassy in Washington denied that their government was behind the attacks, dubbing the allegations 'irresponsible'.

The security breach, which involved the infiltration of at least 300 internet addresses, was found last year and quietly shut down, the Wall Street Journal reported.

After a tip off from the FBI, computer security experts at the Chamber shut it down by unplugging and destroying some computers.

Nevertheless, it is understood that hackers might have been able to access the network for more than a year before the hack was discovered.

It's not clear how much of the compromised data was actually viewed and losses from data theft is often difficult to assess.

Sources close to the Chamber's investigation said that hackers had focused on four employees working on Asia policy, stealing six weeks' worth of their email records.

People close to the case told the Journal the emails revealed names of key firms and individuals in contact with the Chamber, policy documents, meeting notes, trip reports and schedules.

The Chamber's chief operating officer, David Chavern, told the paper: 'What was unusual about it was that this was clearly somebody very sophisticated, who knew exactly who we are and who targeted specific people and used sophisticated tools to try to gather intelligence.'

Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, denied the infiltration, insisting that hacking is banned under Chinese law and shouldn't be 'politicised'.

He told the Journal the allegation that the attack originated in China 'lacks proof and evidence and is irresponsible.'

But the attack on the Chamber's computer systems is just the latest hacking incident where the finger of suspicion has been pointed at China.

Last month it emerged that Chinese agents were suspected of seizing control of U.S. government satellites on four occasions between 2007 and 2008.

A Congressional report into the attacks said that, while it could not prove for sure China was behind the them, what happened was ‘consistent’ with known Chinese cyber war techniques.

A Landsat-7 earth observation satellite system experienced 12 or more minutes of interference in October 2007 and July 2008.

Hackers also interfered with a Terra AM-1 earth observation satellite twice, for two minutes in June 2008 and nine minutes in October that year.

During the final hack ‘the responsible party achieved all steps required to command the satellite’, but did not do so, said the report by the U.S.-China Economic Security and Review Commission.

Both satellites use the commercially operated Svalbard Satellite Station in Spitsbergen, Norway, that ‘routinely relies on the Internet for data access and file transfers,’ the commission said, indicating this might have been how they were attacked.

The satellites affected were run by Nasa or the U.S. Geological Survey and were mostly used for climate observation.

But the U.S. military and intelligence agencies also use them to communicate, collect intelligence and conduct reconnaissance.
