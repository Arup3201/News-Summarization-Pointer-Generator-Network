Jailed: Conman John Boy Hamer, 40 targeted the elderly  by knocking on their doors claiming they were missing tiles on their roofs

A builder who duped pensioners out of hundreds of pounds for repair work he never carried out was caught after one of his victims spotted him - enjoying a game of bingo.

Conman John Boy Hamer, 40, of Talke, Staffordshire, targeted elderly people, some in their 90s, by knocking on their doors claiming they were missing tiles from their roofs.

Between December 2012 and June 2013 he accepted £580 up front for the repair work but then disappeared.

Police issued an arrest warrant after his victims reported his scam and he was finally caught when an 85-year-old man, whom he had conned, saw him at his local bingo club.

Yesterday Hamer was jailed for five years after conspiracy to commit fraud, theft, fraud, four breaches of an anti-social behaviour order and failing to surrender to bail.

Sentencing him at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Judge Paul Glenn told him: 'Your victims were highly vulnerable.

'Your convictions illustrate on a quite regular basis that you target the elderly and vulnerable.'

The court head police captured Hamer after he bumped into one of his victims at a Hanley bingo hall in Stoke-on-Trent.

Officers tracked him down through his bingo membership details after the OAP recognised him at Gala Bingo.

Two weeks earlier he had paid him £230 for repairs to his roof - only for Hamer to take the money and never carry out the work.

Prosecutor Fiona Cortese said: 'The 85-year-old man recognised Hamer as the defendant banged past him, knocking into a female.

'The defendant was traced through his bingo membership details.

'Hamer had visited his home after claiming he had bought the property next door.

'He said roof slates were dislodged, agreed the £230 fee for the work, and then went with him to a cash machine.

'The defendant took the money and put it in his pocket. The defendant said he was going to get some tools to start the work. He left and did not return.

'The victim was very disappointed to have been taken for a fool.'

The court heard an 87-year-old woman who paid Hamer £100 for roof repairs only for him to disappear when he asked her to fetch a pen.

He also tried to con a 90-year-old man but he refused to pay £35 for repairs to three tiles.

Police arrested Hamer at his home  in 2013.

Officers seized £120, his Gala Bingo membership and several mobile phones which put him in the areas at the times the offences were committed.

Joanne Wallbanks, defending, said: 'He would like the victims to know that he is extremely sorry.'

Hamer was also handed a three-year driving ban because he used vehicles to commit the offences.

Trading standards officials have now urged residents to make sure they get at least two quotes before having work carried out to their homes.

Trading standards leader Gill Heath said: 'We strongly advise people to never go along with suggestions from doorstep traders about home improvement work or repairs.

'Residents should obtain quotes from at least one reputable trader if work is needed.

'People should politely refuse if a doorstep trader says work should be done and call the police if they feel threatened.'
