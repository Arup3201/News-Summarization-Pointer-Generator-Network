Two high school girls who ran away from home over a week ago are now believed to be sex trafficking victims.

Keyanna Monson and Samantha Eldredge, both 16, from Snohomish County, Washington, left their homes on January 28, with a friend of the two saying the girls had several bags packed and mentioned they were leaving town.

The girls did not say where they were going, and just a few days later all their belongings were found in the trunk of a car.

Authorities now believe the two girls may be sex trafficking victims

Janée Call, a close friend of Monson’s mother, told KIRO that authorities said the only thing that was not in the trunk of that car were the backpacks belonging to the two girls.

She also said that Monson's cell phone was discovered after she disappeared as well. 

Call also revealed that Monson had been contacted by older men on sites like Kik and Zoosk, which have been used to lure young girls in past incidents.

Authorities meanwhile think they two girls may be spending time in hotels in and around the Puget Sound area.

'With sex trafficking usually comes a bevy of other crimes-- usually drug abuse, physical abuse, sexual assault-- so pulling them out of that world as quickly as possible is what we’re aiming for,' said Shari Ireton, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Office.

Anyone with information is asked to call 911 immediately, or contact the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office anonymous tip line at (425-388-3845).
