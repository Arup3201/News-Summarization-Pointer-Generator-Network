A father has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after his toddler son was found dead inside a sweltering car while he was passed out drunk inside the home.

Wayne M. Hubert, 32, from Illinois, was charged on Friday, one day after his wife found their 23-month-old son Nathan in their car, where he was trapped in temperatures of up to 135 degrees for more than two hours.

He was also charged with two counts of endangering the welfare of a child because his four-year-old daughter was at home when he was passed out. He was released on $250,000 bail on Saturday.

Tragic: As 23-month-old Nathan Hubert was dying in a sweltering car parked outside his home last Thursday, his father Wayne lay on the floor of the home, passed out and drunk

Booked: He was also charged with two counts of 
endangering the welfare of a child  because his four-year-old daughter 
was at home when he was passed out

The county coroner has said 23-month-old Nathan had a temperature of 104.6 degrees when first responders arrived on Thursday afternoon. The temperature that day was above 90.

Hubert took Nathan out to his vehicle, a black Hyundai Elantra four-door with a dark-colored interior, at about 2:30pm with plans to make a trip, according to O'Fallon Police.

Inside, a charging document says, Hubert 'consumed alcohol to a level which caused him to pass out'.

The boy's mother came home about 5pm and the child was found strapped into his car seat. Only one of the windows in the vehicle was cranked open.

When police arrived at the home, the mother was in the yard cradling her son and wailing. Nathan was pronounced dead at the scene.

Neighbors described Hubert as a loving father. A phone message left for Hubert on Sunday wasn't returned.

Keith Richter, 63, a neighbor who lives across the street from the family said: 'They are fantastic people. From what I could observe, they always seemed to be very 
attentive and well-caring parents

Heartbroken: When police arrived the mother was wailing in the yard of their O'Fallon, Illinois, home with her son in her arms

O’Fallon police Chief John Betten told STLToday.com: 'As a result of that long of an exposure in the 90s for somebody less than two, the consequences were going to be dire.'

Neighbors remember Nathan as a happy, energetic toddler who could be seen laughing and playing with his 32-year-old father outside their home along Joy Drive in the southwest Illinois community of O'Fallon.

accident and that I know, he would never do anything intentionally to 
harm his children.'Non traffic Fatalities of Children.JPG

Nathan was the 13th child to die this summer alone from being left in an overheated car.

On average, 38 children die in the United States each year because they are either forgotten and left inside a vehicle or manage to get inside without anyone knowing and then cannot get back out.

Over the weekend, a three-year-old boy in Florida died after his parents accidentally left him in the car while they were attending a funeral.

Kyrese Anderson was pronounced dead after spending about three hours in the back of the hot car, with his siblings and babysitter just feet away.

Earlier this month, a five-month-old baby girl died after being left in a minivan for hours.

KidsandCars.org suggests parents take precautions to keep them from forgetting about children sitting in rear car seats. For example, leaving a purse or cell phone in the backseat is a good way to ensure that you will look in the back of the vehicle before getting out of it.

Another way is to put a large stuffed animal in the seat when the baby is not in the vehicle. When the baby is in the vehicle, the group suggests you put the stuffed animal in the front seat as a reminder that a baby is in the back.
