A paraplegic woman is suing General Motors after a car seat heater allegedly scorched her buttocks.

Emma Verrill, 26, claims she suffered third-degree burns and needed surgery after sitting in a 2008 Chevrolet Suburban two years ago.

Verrill says in her suit that the car manufacturer didn't adequately test the rear 
seat heaters to prevent them from reaching 'dangerously high 
temperatures that would burn human flesh.'

General Motors denies the heater was defective or that it caused the Texas woman's injuries.

Taking action: Paraplegic Emma Verrill, 26 (pictured) is suing General Motors after a car seat heater allegedly scorched her buttocks in 2012

Paraplegic: Wheelchair-bound Emma Verrill (pictured right and left) is paralyzed from the waist 
down and says she can't feel hot and cold in the lower half of her body

Verrill, who is paralyzed from the waist down, filed the suit in the U.S. District 
Court in Portland, Maine, last month.

The wheelchair-bound woman told Portland Press Herald she she can feel touch but not temperature in her lower body.

She said she didn't know that the seat heater in her friend's vehicle was activated on June 28, 2012, as they drove from New York City to the Connecticut shore.

'I have very limited sensation. I have touch sensation, but I don't have temperature sensation,' she said.

'So if water is too hot or if something is too cold, I can't tell. Because of that, my body can tell me in other ways if there is something that isn't really right.'

Verrill, who was paralyzed after botched spinal surgery at age 15, said she noticed a blister the size of her palm on her buttocks the next day.

The teaching fellow said a doctor had to remove a section of skin from her upper thigh to graft in place of her burned flesh. She said doctors and her friend said the burn was likely to have been caused by the seat heater.

After surgery, Verrill claims she was bedridden for three months and was dependent on her parents in Yarmouth, Maine.

According to Portland Press Herald, General Motors filed a court response denying the heater was defective or that it caused Verrill's injuries.

A US magistrate has ordered both sides to be ready for trial by May 4, 2015. Verrill is seeking unspecified damages.

The lawsuit comes at a time when General Motors has been harshly criticized for safety defects in other vehicles.

This year, the company reportedly had to recall more than 20 million vehicles.

A spokeswoman for consumer advocacy group Center for Auto Safety said they had no record of recalls or lawsuits related to seat heaters in the Suburban line.
