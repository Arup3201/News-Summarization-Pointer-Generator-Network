Diego Costa appears increasingly likely to be released by Spain after he was spared a trip to Madrid and had medical tests in London.

Costa suffered yet another hamstring injury during Chelsea’s 3-2 win at Hull on Sunday, and was checked over by the Spanish FA on Monday.

Spain boss Vicente del Bosque made plans for his absence by calling Juanmi, a 21-year-old striker from Malaga, into the squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Ukraine on Friday and next week’s friendly against Holland.

It will leave Costa free to focus on regaining full fitness for his club’s next game, against Stoke City on Sunday week.

Jose Mourinho said club doctor Paco Biosca was against the idea of an operation but Costa may yet consider corrective surgery at the end of the season in an attempt to solve the hamstring problem which has nagged him for a year.

Loic Remy, who came on for Costa at Hull and scored the winner, is not in the France squad and will have two weeks to convince Mourinho he deserves more game time.

Didier Drogba did not travel to Hull but also expects to be available if Costa is not ready to face Stoke.

‘I know that Diego is the number one,’ said Remy. ‘But when the manager needs me, I give my best for him.’

Costa had scored Chelsea's second goal as they stormed into a 2-0 lead within 10 minutes on Sunday

Hull were able to draw level before half-time and when Costa was subbed off the scores were locked at 2-2
