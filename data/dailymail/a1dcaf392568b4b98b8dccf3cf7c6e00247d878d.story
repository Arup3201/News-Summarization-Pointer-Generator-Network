Not even a bouquet of flowers and a balloon could raise a smile from White Dee today just hours after learning her sickness benefits are apparently going to be cut.

The Department for Work and Pensions has reportedly frozen the reality TV star's £101 a week sickness benefit after she started cashing in on her growing celebrity status.

The Channel 4 Benefits Street star angered taxpayers recently when she was pictured on a jolly to Magaluf where she was she seen downing pints, shots and champagne.

A 
neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I don't know if someone 
ordered the flowers to her house or what they were for, but she said 
thanks and that was that.

'She didn't seem happy at all, just looked quite down and I am not surprised after hearing her benefits had been cut.'

Cheer up Dee! Despite receiving a bouquet of flowers and a balloon on her doorstep today, White Dee looked glum after learning that her benefits 'have been frozen'

The 42-year-old had defiantly insisted ‘I’m not doing anything wrong’ and 
said she would continue taking state handouts until the Prime Minister 
or the Government stops her.

The mother-of-two, real name Deirdre Kelly, has repeatedly claimed that she is too depressed to work and her Magaluf trip was a pick-me-up for which she was not paid.

But, according to The Sun, her Employment and Support Allowance has now been cut by the DWP, who could investigate her to see whether she has stuck to the rules.

Not even a mystery bouquet of flowers and a balloon could raise a smile from Miss Kelly today just hours after learning of the apparent decision.

Her representative Barry Tomes insists all her work has been properly declared to the authorities.

He refused to confirm whether her benefits have been cut but accused the DWP of being 'inefficient and ineffective' in dealing with her changing circumstances.

He told MailOnline: 'I have been in communication with the benefits agency since February when I first took her on, my last communication with them was on May 13. We have not heard anything back from them in all that time.

'Miss Kelly remains available to meet with the job centre team as we have previously told them. They have declined.'

Mr Tomes said it was possible Miss Kelly's benefits had been cut temporarily due to her income rising from one-off media appearances, but the state payments could resume if her earnings drop again.

But Mr Tomes threatened legal action against the government if it emerges the DWP has released any of Ms Kelly's personal details to the media.

He said: 'If we can prove that a public, government department have leaked documents about Dee then we will use the full weight of the law against them because that would be outrageous.'

After Dee appeared at her front door to recieve some gifts yesterday, a neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I don't know if someone ordered the flowers to her house or what they were for, but she said thanks and that was that.

Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) offers financial help for those unable to work due to disability or long-term illness.

Claimants have to undergo an assessment to see the extent of their disability and how it affects their ability to work.

Those whose disability is not severe have to attend regular interviews with an adviser, but those severely affected are not required to attend.

How much claimants get is determined by their circumstances, but the normal rate is up to £108.15 a week, according the Department of Work and Pensions.

Miss Kelly's agent has previously said her depression is regularly reviewed by her doctor, who was consulted about her trips abroad.

'She didn’t seem happy at all, just looked quite down. I am not surprised after hearing her benefits had been cut.

'Now she really does look depressed but everyone agrees its only fair judging on what she’s been doing.'

Miss Kelly, 
whose handouts equate to the take-home pay of someone earning £20,000 a 
year, was getting £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance –
 formerly known as Sickness Benefit – Child Tax Credit and Child 
Benefit, plus £500 a month Housing Benefit.

But she was recently pictured partying in Magaluf in Majorca and enjoying a steak dinner
 at a top restaurant.

‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron,’ she said.

Her
 last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – 
and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000.

Following
 the popularity of Benefits Street, which followed the lives of families 
on James Turner Street in Birmingham, Miss Kelly has had at least six 
offers to front programmes, including one for a cookery show in France.

She has done promotional work abroad, made a rap record and has been DJing at nightclubs in Birmingham.

High life: White Dee, who was paid to go to Magaluf and drink champagne in Magaluf bars like this one, has since had her benefits slashed, it has emerged

She
 has dined out at the city’s upmarket Malmaison hotel brasserie and is 
reported to have agreed a big-money deal to appear on the next Celebrity
 Big Brother.

Miss Kelly told the Sun on Sunday: ‘Yes, I am taking 
casual work. I won’t tell you how much I am earning but it’s not half as
 much as people think.’

In
 exchange for the break, she says, she agreed to be the special guest at
 a pool party, judge a wet T-shirt contest and go on a bar crawl to 
promote a travel firm.

But she said: ‘The pool party was not really my scene and I don’t drink, so the bar crawl was not my thing either.’

She said the shot glasses she was photographed downing were filled with water.

‘I
 wouldn’t say I was miserable, but that doesn’t mean I am not depressed.
 I’m on sickness benefit and trying to get back into full-time work. 

‘Do I have to stop claiming benefits because I spent two days in Majorca?

‘Would people be less upset if I went to Skegness?’

The 
DWP said this morning that it not discuss individual claimants, but has previously said: ‘Where 
there is evidence of benefit fraud, we would not hesitate to 
investigate.’
