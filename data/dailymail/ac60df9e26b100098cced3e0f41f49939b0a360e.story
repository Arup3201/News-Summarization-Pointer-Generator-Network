Britain enjoyed the warmest day of the year so far yesterday with temperatures rising above 26C.

But the warm weather gave way to heavy rain overnight with up to 20mm expected to have fallen in the space of an hour in the south-east from midnight.

Yesterday afternoon, the Met Office confirmed the temperature had hit 26.4C in Herstmonceux, East Sussex.

Meanwhile, it was slightly cooler at 25C on Rio de Janeiro's famous Copacabana beach in Brazil.

At Ascot, racegoers fanned themselves to try and stay cool in the Royal Enclosure and sunbathers were out in force on Brighton beach.

It was not just London and the South East that enjoyed balmy conditions with maximum temperatures of 24C in the Midlands; 22C in Northern Ireland; 21C in Manchester and 20.3C in Scotland.

The pollen count will be high in the next few days as Britain enjoys warmer weather, the Met Office warned today.

Britain has had a relatively low pollen count so far this year because of unsettled weather.

Yolanda Clewlow, Health Manager at the Met Office said: 'We have seen some very high pollen counts during the recent fine weather.

'Further high counts are also expected during periods of warmer, drier weather across most parts of England and Wales.'

The Met Office said the pollen season is split into three phases and we are currently in the 'grass pollen season' which lasts from mid-May through to August.

Tuesday had been tipped to be the 
warmest day of the year but the sunshine struggled to break through the 
cloud, and the highest temperature recorded was 24C in Manchester - 
slightly below 25C on June 6 in Lee-On-Solent, Hampshire.

Further north today, temperatures are remaining lower, with the driest weather expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and northern England. North-west Scotland will be the coolest region.

The warm weather comes as Met Office experts warned that Britain faces a decade of wet summers, as they got together to discuss recent unusual weather patterns.

They blame natural warming in the 
Atlantic for pushing a current of fast-flowing air in the upper 
atmosphere, known as the jet stream, further south.

Scientists say the likelihood of 
successive heavy downpours is increased if Britain is stranded north of 
the jet stream for long stretches of summer.

They claim more traditional summers will return after between five and ten years.

Since 2007, when forecasters suspect 
the phenomenon began, six of the seven summers have been washouts with 
higher than average rainfall. Known as the ‘Atlantic multidecadal 
oscillation’, it is a natural warming or cooling of the ocean over a 
period of several decades.

Britain experienced a series of wet summers when Atlantic conditions were similar in the Fifties, early Sixties, and the 1880s.

The country endured the coldest 
spring since 1962 this year, with a mean temperature across March, April
 and May of 6C (43F), 1.7C below the long-term average.

Meet the horse that looks more like a zebra after being dressed in an animal-print suit to stop him scratching.

Charlie has been dressed up in a black and white striped jacket to keep the flies away. His skin becomes itchy when he is bitten, and the scratches become sore because of the irritation.

His owner Laura Forsyth said: 'It's a fly suit which keeps the flies from biting him.

'The flies get confused when they see stripes so they tend to avoid him. Charlie gets a reaction to flies and becomes extremely uncomfortable as they make him itch and causes him to have sores from where he scratches his bites.

'It protects him from them and covers his back, neck and legs, as well as going round his stomach.

'There's also a mask which I can put over his face if the amount of flies dramatically increases.'

Equestrian clothing company Bucas came up with the stripey design, specifically for horses with allergies to insects.

The £100 suit, which is made from a specially developed light mesh fabric is part of the Buzz-Off Zebra range by Bucas.

Passing motorists stop to look at Charlie in Plompton, North Yorkshire, because of the unusual design of his jacket.
