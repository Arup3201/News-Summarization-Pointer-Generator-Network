Tom Ince has spoken for the first time about the 'dream' opportunity Inter Milan have offered him to follow in his father’s footsteps.

It is 19 years since Paul Ince left Manchester United to join Inter, where he spent two seasons, and now the Serie A giants are interested in signing his son, who can join up for a nominal compensation fee as his contract with Blackpool about to expire.

The England Under 21 international, who spent the second half of last season at Crystal Palace, has options to remain in the Barclays Premier League but it is the prospect of moving to Italy that has captured the imagination and he has a serious decision to make.

Move abroad: Paul Ince joined Inter Milan in 1995 and spent two seasons playing for the Italian giants

‘It is unbelievable to be mentioned with them,’ said Ince. ‘The history that is there with my old man… It is dreams, it really is dreams. The name of Inter, the history, the stature of the club. There are options there. Going abroad wouldn’t faze me.

‘Look at Gareth Bale – it shows that sometimes it is better to make these moves when you are a boy. I have got to make sure that wherever I am next season, I am a better player. There are still things that I need to learn and get better. But that type of interest is fantastic.’ 

The list of English exports to foreign clubs has barely been added to since Joe Cole’s high-profile loan move from Liverpool to Lille in 2011 and Ince believes the whole experience of moving to Italy – if that is what he decides – would have a number of positive spin-offs.

‘You don’t see many English players doing it,’ said Ince. ‘Whether it is the risk of the language, us English are very lazy because we only want to speak our own language and if no one else does then no one cares. Sometimes you have to look at options like that as it opens up new horizons.

‘Learning a different language and culture, but I haven’t ruled out staying in England. Wherever I choose, it will come down to a gut feeling. I have got a great man behind me to help and advise me but, when it comes down to it, it will be my decision.’
