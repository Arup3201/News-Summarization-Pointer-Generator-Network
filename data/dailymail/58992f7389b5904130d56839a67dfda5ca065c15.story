A father has been accused of blowing marijuana smoke into the mouth of his infant child, police said.

Christopher Kling was detained after officers were allegedly shown a smartphone video of him breathing the fumes into the baby's mouth.

Police were called to reports of a disturbance at the home of the 22-year-old's estranged wife in Beaverton, Oregon, just before midnight on Sunday.

Officers were said to have diffused a row over the pairs children when a concerned family friend passed them the video, according to NBC News.

The friend was alleged to have told police that he was concerned for the child's safety and claimed this was not the first time Kling had blown fumes into the infant's mouth. 

The video, which has not been released by police, allegedly shows the baby coughing after ingesting the vapor, according to court papers.

'Children are one of the most vulnerable in our society and often don't have a voice,' police reportedly told NBC News.

'The Beaverton Police Department is grateful for this family friend that decided to be the voice for this infant.'

Kling was charged with three felony counts of application of a controlled substance to a minor yesterday.

He is currently in Washington County Jail where his bail had been set at $1,000.
