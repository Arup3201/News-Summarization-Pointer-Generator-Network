Living in the heart of Tornado Alley - people from Kansas have learned how to prepare for the worst. 

But the state's governor, Sam Brownback, appears to have taken this practice to new limits after officially declaring October 'Zombie Preparedness Month'.

The Republican politician, 58, will sign a formal declaration today encouraging Kansans to ready themselves for all disasters including an invasion of the walking dead.

Warning: Kansas's governor, Sam Brownback, has named October 'Zombie Preparedness Month' (above, a woman takes part in a zombie gathering world record attempt in Sydney) 

At the end of the month Kansans could get the chance to put their plans into action as Halloween descends on October 31 - bringing it with it a high chance of zombies.  

Citizens are being told to arm themselves for a zombie invasion in much the same way they would for a typhoon, flood or other natural disaster, TIME reports. 

A spokesman from the governor's office said: 'We came up with the idea of Zombie Preparedness Month because it is an engaging way to get people on board with emergency preparedness.

'If you’re equipped to handle the zombie apocalypse then you’re prepared for tornadoes, severe storms, fire and any other natural disaster Kansas usually faces.

'If you’re prepared for zombies, you’re prepared for anything.'

Ready yourselves: Kansans have been told to stockpile supplies which they could survive off for three days in the event of an invasion of zombies, like those pictured above from hit TV show The Walking Dead

Nearly three million citizens are being asked to ensure that they have survival supplies which would last them three days in the event of a zombie uprising.

Speaking to The Telegraph, the state's Deputy Emergency Operations manager said: 'You want to make sure you have all the food and water you need.

'You need to work on your zombie alerts. Of course if you look like a zombie you may be able to escape from them. You may want to avoid cemeteries.

'Good cardio fitness is useful if you want to run away and have good running shows. Ladies should get rid of their high heels.' 

Preparing for a zombie uprising appears to be one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans can agree on as it is believed a 31-page document has been produced, outlining the strategy if the worst was to happen.

Kansans are being offered the chance to learn more about zombie preparedness at a lecture in Topeka tomorrow - where a free disaster pack will be given to the first 300 people.

Using zombies as a hypothetical worst-case scenario is not unheard of in the U.S.

In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ran a zombie awareness campaign of its own while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also had an initiative in 2012.
