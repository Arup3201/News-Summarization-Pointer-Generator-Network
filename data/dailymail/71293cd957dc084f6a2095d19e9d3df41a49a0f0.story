A teenage boy claims he has managed to capture a ‘guardian ghost’ on his phone at a Great War cemetery in France.

Mitch Glover, 14, from Leamington Spa, was visiting the Neuville-St Vaast German war cemetery near Arras, in northern France, during a school trip when he took a photograph of the ‘ghost’.

Not until after the school boy came home, did he notice the eerie figure in one of his pictures, which he says looks like a man wearing the uniform of a Scottish regiment.

Can you spot the ghost? MItch Glover, 14, took this image of the Neuville-St Vaast German war cemetery near Arras, in northern France

Mitch was visiting France on a school 
trip when he snapped several iPhone pictures in quick succession of the 
war cemetery near Arras, scene of bloody battles of World War I, nearly a
 hundred years ago.

Number 
three in the series of black-and-white images sees a ghostly white 
figure watching over the grave markers in the left of the frame.

After
 looking into the history of the region, Mitch's family discovered that 
the shape of the apparition could resemble that of the kilt and Tam 
o'Shanter uniform of the historic Seaforth Highlander regiment.

Neuville-St
 Vaast is the largest German cemetery in France, containing 44,833 
burials, and is located a few hundred metres away from Nine Elms 
military cemetery.

Buried at Nine Elms are twelve N.C.O'S. and men of the 114th Seaforth Highlanders who fell on the 9th April, 1917.

‘Our
 school tour was to look at war graves as we are studying poetry of the 
First World War in literature and I am doing history,’ Mitch said.

‘I
 didn't feel anything at the time, I just took it. I took it in a rush. I
 snapped four as I knew I could just choose the best afterwards.

‘It
 was when I got home, I was sat on the sofa flicking through pictures 
when I saw it and immediately ran upstairs to show my mum. She was kinda
 freaked out. It caught my eye and I saw it and went “wow”.

‘It looks like there is someone stood there, I thought it was like a ghost from World War One. A soldier.’

Mitch's
 mother Sue, 50, an antiques dealer, says: ‘He came upstairs, he said “I
 got something on my picture, I think I got a ghost” and I didn't 
believe him at first and asked him to show me.

'My reaction was "oh my". 
It was immediate to me, you could see there was something in that one 
place.

‘We checked his other
 pictures, and it was just on that one, just one. It's stood at ground 
level. Because it is the middle one of the sequence, it takes away the 
idea that there must have been a splodge on there.

‘It
 didn't look like a German soldier. I thought it just looked out of 
place. And then a friend of mine said, do you realise that looks a bit 
Scottish, like World War outfits from the Seaforth Highlanders.

'I
 could see what they meant. It looks like they are holding something in 
one arm. Whether it's a rifle or something one friend said it looks like
 he's stood on guard over them. ‘

The
 Seaforth Highlanders was a historic regiment of the British Army 
associated with large areas of the northern Highlands of Scotland.

During
 the Great War they took part in the retreat from Le Cateau, the Battle 
of the Marne and the subsequent chase of the German forces to the River 
Aisne. In mid-September 1914, the battalion was heavily involved in the 
Battle of the Aisne, suffering heavy casualties including the CO.
