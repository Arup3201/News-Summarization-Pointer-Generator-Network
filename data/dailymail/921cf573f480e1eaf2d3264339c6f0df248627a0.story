They might own vast chateaux, private jets galore and ocean-going super-yachts but all billionaires really want is to be normal.

Jacques Peretti, the man behind a new documentary, The Super Rich And Us, says the world's wealthiest put everyday experiences such as a hassle-free walk along the street above amassing a wardrobe of Rolexes or lavish spending sprees.

Peretti, whose credits also include The Men Who Made Us Spend,  spent months with the world's wealthiest in a bid to find out what makes them tick.

'What's really fascinating is that it's such a closed off world to the rest of us,' he explains. 'The way the world is changing at the moment is moving things very much in their direction. 

'The super rich are no longer just of freak interest - they'll be playing a real role in future. What's interesting is because governments are essentially broke, the onus will fall more on the super rich and corporations to do more. The role is being pushed upon them.'

In the documentary, which will be screened tonight on BBC2, Peretti meets some of the UK's wealthiest residents, among them Air Asia and Tune Hotels boss, Tony Fernandes.

According to Peretti, Mr Fernandes, who is thought to be worth around £650m, doesn't consider himself particularly wealthy. 

'It's kind of interesting that the wealthy never see themselves as wealthy,' he explains. 'Not even billionaires see themselves as wealthy because they're always looking to the next person. 

'Tony Fernandes, who owns Queens Park Rangers football club as well as Air Asia, told me that he wouldn't call himself rich and that I should look at someone like Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.'

Bezos is worth an estimated $29.7bn making him wealthier than Fernandes but considerably poorer than Carlos Slim Helú, the Mexican telecoms magnate who, with his $79.6bn fortune, is the world's wealthiest man.

Regardless of whether their wealth can be counted in the billions or hundreds of millions, Peretti says the majority have surprisingly simple tastes.

'Billionaires are expected to own things like Lear Jets, super-yachts and so on. But if you speak to very wealthy people, they see that as a bit tacky.

'As Tony Fernandes said to me, "Why would I want to spend all my time sitting around on a boat in the ocean? It would be boring!"'

Instead, says Peretti, what the super rich really want are 'experiences'. 'It's about exclusivity and experiences,' he explains.

'They want things that no-one else can have, like flying to the moon. Bentleys, Rolexes and all that stuff is just blingy and tacky. It's the sort of thing that a footballer would have.

'They all have this impish sense of humour about how people view them,' continues Peretti. 'They can be quite eccentric about not doing the things people expect them to do. 

'Tony Fernandes, for instance, likes to go home and have beans on toast.'

The same attitude influences their choice of place to live, with many choosing London partly because the city's tolerant attitude allows them to live a normal life.

'A lot are attracted to London because it's multicultural,' explains Peretti. 'One Russian tycoon told me that, "Here, I can take my kids to school".

'That wouldn't be possible in Moscow because the risk of being robbed or kidnapped or having your money taken away by the government is all too real.

'For people like him, being normal is an impossible luxury. Billionaires love the idea they can get on the bus if they want.'

While they might want to get on the bus like the rest of us, the presence of the super-rich has also had an unexpected consequence in the shape of what Peretti calls 'vertical aspiration'.

'In the 1950s, people would keep up with Joneses, with their neighbours. Now, with the super rich, aspirations have gone through the roof. 

'You feel that you haven't made it if you don't own a super-yachts or spend winter in Verbier. Because of that, credit card spending has gone through the roof.'

Nevertheless, the wealthy, says Peretti, aren't entirely to blame. 'It is not all bad,' he says. 'People paint the super rich as these evil people. They aren't, they're just trying to live their lives.' As normally as possible, it would seem.
