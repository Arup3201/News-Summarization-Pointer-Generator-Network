U.S. Olympian Simon Cho said Friday he agreed to a coach's demand to tamper with a Canadian rival's skates last year.

Cho said he was embarrassed by his 
actions and called his decision to comply the 'biggest mistake of my 
life' and one he regrets.

He
also said he apologized to Olivier Jean, whose skates he sabotaged at 
the 2011 World Team Championship in Poland.

'He sounded
personally understanding,' Cho said of his conversation. Cho said the 
tampering occurred after the U.S. team had already been eliminated from 
competition.

'When he spoke in Korean, I knew he was serious,' Cho, said of his coach Jae Su Chun, at a press conference at his attorney's Salt Lake City office today.

'The
repetitiveness and aggressiveness of how he came at me was very 
intimidating. ... I knew he wasn't going to take no for an answer.'

He maintained Chun was angry at the Canadians and convinced they had aided another team to ensure the U.S. had been eliminated.

Cho said the tampering took just a few
seconds, and was done with a blade bender normally used to ensure a 
skater's blade follows the proper radius in short track.

'I always knew it was wrong that day,' Cho said. 'I was very scared. I was frightened. And I was intimidated.'

He
said Chun at the time said he would take full responsibility if the 
tampering were ever discovered. But when Cho spoke with him about it a 
month ago, he said Chun denied any involvement.

The
allegations are part a scandal involving Chun, also accused by a dozen 
national team members of 'unchecked' verbal, psychological and physical 
abuse.

Cho has not signed 
onto the complaint and continues to skate with the National Racing 
Program under interim coach Jun Hyung Yeo. But said he would not skate 
for Chun.

Cho said fellow skater Jeff Simon witnessed the first request in English.

Cho also said he would not skate again
for Chun, whom he said he personally witnessed douse a skater with 
water and hit him with a notebook.

Cho's comments confirmed several allegations made in the arbitration demand that seeks to permanently remove U.S. coach Chun.

Canadian speed skater Olivier Jean said last month that he suspected his skates had been tampered with in the 2011 team championship in Poland.

He said that at the time, ‘we had our suspicions there was sabotage but we had no proof,’ the Chicago Tribune reported.

He said that before the race, the teams from the U.S. and Canada shared a dressing room.

Jean told Montreal newspaper La Presse at the time: ‘If there had been a plot orchestrated by the coaches, they should have been…shrewd enough to keep it among themselves and not involve athletes, which increases the chance for leaks.’

Chun has denied any wrongdoing but is suspended.

U.S. Speedskating has scheduled a press conference later Friday to discuss the findings of an independent investigation of Chun.

'The
conduct at issue is repugnant and antithetical to the values of the 
Olympic Movement and inconsistent with Team USA's commitment to fair 
play,' Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee, 
said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Friday morning.

'We
regret that an American athlete was involved, and intend to actively 
engage with US Speedskating to ensure that appropriate action is taken.'

Cho, who turns 21 in a few days, couldn't say what would happen with Chun or the other coaches but said he has been 'honest and forthright' with all investigations.

'I hope that I can make up for my mistake and continue to skate in the future,' said Cho, a 2010 Olympic relay bronze medalist and 2011 individual world champion.

On Sunday, after failing to qualify for the U.S. fall World Cup team, Cho said he expected to be banned or suspended because of the charges.

Chun's attorney, Russell Fericks, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Friday.

But on Thursday he said it was his personal opinion that Cho is 'young and impressionable.'

'It is sad that he feels compelled to support the irresponsible canard that Coach Chun instructed him to tamper with another skater's skate,' Fericks said.

Cho's attorney reiterated Friday that his client acted under great pressure.

'He had nothing personally to gain from doing it, and it was an isolated incident completely inconsistent with who Simon is as a person. Simon is admitting his mistake, apologizing to those affected by his actions, and taking responsibility for what he did,' attorney John Wunderli said.
