Prince George is one cute baby, but apparently not cherubic enough to make it on the cover of People without a little photoshopping.

The young royal is the coverboy of this week's magazine in honor of his first birthday, and the staff chose to use a picture taken while he was touring Australia earlier this year.

But when compared to the original photo, the prince seems to have much redder lips. The whites of his eyes also appear whiter in the new version, and one of his eyebrows has also been smoothed.

The magazine has since issued a statement to MailOnline denying any retouching.

Like putting lipstick on a baby: Prince George appears with some bright red lips on this week's cover of People magazine

Happy birthday: The original picture of Prince George was taken while he was touring Australia with his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, earlier this year. He is the cover of this week's issue in honor of his first birthday

Imperfections: In the original photo, the whites of Prince George's eyes aren't as white, and one of his eyebrows isn't smoothed

'PEOPLE did not alter the looks of 
Prince George on our cover in any way.  Some areas may have picked up 
saturation during the press run, further enhanced by the glossy paper 
quality,' a spokesman for the magazine said.

This latest photoshopping scandal comes just a day after Vanity Fair magazine was accused of altering Prince William's balding head.

The magazine used a picture taken of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son while touring Australia earlier this year.

But a comparison of the front cover with the original photo appears to show Prince William's hair looking much thicker than it is.

Vanity Fair was also accused this week of digitally thickening The Duke of Cambridge's hair in its front cover photo, pictured left, from another picture taken in Australia, right

The suggested retouching of the image was spotted by fashion website Racked, which compared the two images side-by-side.

The website then commented: 'Upon comparison it is undeniable that Vanity Fair has photoshopped a little more hair onto that head. Le scandal!'

A Vanity Fair spokesman denied any photoshopping.
