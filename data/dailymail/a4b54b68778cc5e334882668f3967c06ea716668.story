West Ham United

West Ham will be without defender Winston Reid through suspension for Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash against Newcastle.

Midfielders Stewart Downing and Cheikhou Kouyate (both knee) have returned to training.

Forward Diafra Sakho (back) remains doubtful so Andy Carroll could face his former club, while Alex Song, Mark Noble and Enner Valencia are also fitness concerns with minor knocks.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Cresswell, Tomkins, Collins, Jenkinson, Noble, Amalfitano, Nolan, Downing, Valencia, Carroll, Jaaskelainen, Demel, O'Brien, Song, Sakho, Zarate, Jarvis, Vaz Te.

Newcastle United

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is giving nothing away about his walking wounded as he prepares for Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to West Ham.

Central defenders Fabricio Coloccini (calf) and Steven Taylor (knee), and midfielders Cheick Tiote (calf) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) have returned to training, but Pardew is remaining coy over which, if any, of them could be fit for the trip to Upton Park.

Keeper Tim Krul is understood to have picked up a training ground knock and could be a doubt, while midfielder Mehdi Abeid is still out with a toe problem. Also missing are utility man Ryan Taylor, who faces up to four weeks out with the knee problem he sustained against QPR, full-back Davide Santon (also knee) and midfielders Siem de Jong and Gabriel Obertan (both thigh).

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Alnwick, Janmaat, Dummett, Williamson, Coloccini, S. Taylor, Streete, Haidara, Tiote, Anita, Sissoko, Colback, Cabella, Gouffran, Ameobi, Riviere, Cisse, Perez, Armstrong, Ferreyra.
