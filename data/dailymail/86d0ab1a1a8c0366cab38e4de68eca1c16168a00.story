'Tough new stance': Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, is set to announce new rules for dealing with benefit cheats

Benefit cheats face up to ten years in prison under new rules that  mean the offence will be treated as seriously as bank fraud.

Britain’s top prosecutor will today announce that middle-class and ‘professional’ cheats who get ‘one over on the system’ will be sent straight to Crown Court where they will face similar sentences as money launderers.

Keir Starmer, head of the Crown Prosecution Service, said society was hurting as a result of people taking advantage of the benefit system, and he would crack down on perpetrators.

He will announce a ‘tough stance’ for ‘those who flout the system’ and will ensure that for the first time, the overall cost of benefit fraud to the country will be considered when charges are pursued.Mr Starmer said: ‘It’s not only taxpayers that suffer.

‘Benefits exist to protect and support the most vulnerable people in our society and, whenever the system is defrauded, it’s also taking money away from those with a genuine need.

‘The cost to the nation incurred by benefit fraud should be at the forefront of lawyers’ minds when considering whether a prosecution is in the public interest.

‘The loss of money has a significant impact on communities up and down the country.’

Benefit and tax credit fraud costs Britain more than £2billion a year.

Offences of less than £20,000 were previously dealt with in magistrates’ courts, where sentences are restricted to 12 months.

The new guidelines have discarded the financial limit so that small cases will be sent to Crown court, where perpetrators can receive longer sentences.

They will result in more suspects being charged under the Fraud Act, and could be sentenced to ten years in prison.

Under current guidelines, benefit cheats are often charged under social security legislation and face a maximum sentence of seven years.

Mr Starmer said: ‘The guidance for prosecutors is clear that if the evidence demonstrates an element of dishonesty, rather than just knowledge of a fraud, the appropriate charges should be used.

‘This will ensure that following conviction, all options are on the table for magistrates and judges, including custodial sentences.

‘Indeed, prosecutors are also instructed not to shy away from using a range of legislation that carries higher sentences where it is merited.’
