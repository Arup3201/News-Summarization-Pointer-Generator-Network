Britain's three biggest water companies are to lift their hosepipe bans tomorrow, the Mail can reveal.

Anglian Water, Thames Water and Southern Water are to end restrictions because of the ‘exceptional’ rainfall over the last three days, on top of April’s record levels.

It comes as parts of the South including the road, pictured below, leading into Bognor Regis, were left submerged after enduring almost two months’ worth of rain in as many days.

Those reaching for the how to 
emigrate handbook should be aware that scorching weather is predicted 
for the first two weeks of July AND for a two-week spell in August.

Long-range
 weather forecaster David King said London was set to 'swelter' during 
the second week of the Olympics, with temperatures hitting more than 
30C.

Wimbledon will 
also bask in sunshine during the second week of the tournament - but 
only after rain has washed out the first week of tennis.
 Mr King, whose meteorological skills were used by the royal family when
 planning Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding, said: 
'Unfortunately this wet weather and cold easterly wind is going to stay 
with us now until the end of June.

'But
 the heat will arrive in the first week of July and last right through 
to the 15th. Temperatures might even get to 30 by the middle of the 
month.'

And despite the
 recent deluge of rain, Mr King said the hot, dry weather predicted for 
July and August would mean the drought in the South East was likely to 
continue into next year.

The
 72-year-old amateur forecaster, who uses phases of the moon and his 
observations of nature to predict the weather, said by the end of the 
summer the drought would be worse than that of 1976 - when some 
households were even left without tap water.

Mr King, whose forecasts focus on London and the South East, also said there won’t be a repeat of last year’s glorious autumn.

He said: 'The first two weeks of September will be pretty good, but then rain storms will come in.'

Spraying the roadside: A car drives through a 
large puddle on a road amid persistent rain in the village of 
Winchfield, Hampshire

Dangerous: The standing water was a hazard on the road in Winchfield as cars and lorries were forced to slow down to cross it

Hazardous: A lorry prepares to negotiate 
standing water on the A33, which is closed due to flooding in Chineham 
near Basingstoke, Hampshire. The Environment Agency has put 
out more than 40 flood warnings across the country

Be aware: The map on the left shows the rain concentrated in the South East this week while the map on the right shows the majority of yesterday's red flood warnings were located in the South East and East Anglia

Homes were evacuated, schools were 
closed and dozens of areas were put on flood alert, with Bognor and 
Brighton particularly badly hit.

The hosepipe ban started on April 5 
and has been in place for just over two months, but ever since it began 
Britain has been deluged by rain.

April and the Easter holidays were a 
washout for tens of thousands of families, and after a brief respite in 
May the bad weather returned for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations last 
week.

The ban covered the use of hosepipes 
for watering gardens, filling paddling pools and washing cars. Those 
spotted flouting the ban faced fines of up to £1,000.

Ministers are expected to announce 
tomorrow that 15million of the 21million people currently covered by the
 ban will be free to use their hosepipes again. A source told the Mail: 
‘The recent very heavy rain, the record rainfalls in April and the 
reasonable amount of rain in May have all eased the problems.

Four smaller water companies – South 
East Water, Veolia Central, Veolia South East and Sutton and East Surrey
 – are expected to keep the ban in place. The source said this is 
because they rely far more heavily on groundwater pulled from bore holes
 deep underground, where the heavy rain hasn’t yet managed to penetrate.

Residents of Felpham Way, leading into
 Bognor Regis, will have little need of their hosepipes just yet after 
36 hours of continuous rain in the South East turned the road  into a 
river. Floodwater rose almost waist-deep in places,  cars were submerged
 and some residents resorted to boats to get around.

And in the village of Elmer, also in 
West Sussex, emergency teams waded through water and used boats to reach
 250 vulnerable homes to make sure residents were safe following reports
 of flooding up to 6ft deep.

Last night it was the South West’s turn to 
suffer the full force of what is rapidly becoming ‘Monsoon June’.

Devon, Cornwall and South Wales all suffered torrential rain, and up to 60mm is  predicted for today.

The Environment Agency  said there is a
 ‘continued risk’ of surface water flooding from overwhelmed drains 
across parts of London, East and West Sussex, Surrey and Kent.

Last night 30 flood alerts and four 
more serious flood warnings were still in place, with the wet weather 
set to continue for the rest of the week and into the weekend.

Yet as the South suffered a deluge, the North basked in sunshine.

Daytrippers in North Wales enjoyed the
 summer colours of the National Trust’s Bodnant Gardens, while Scotland 
is enjoying unusually dry – if cool – weather for this time of year.

Julian Mayes, a forecaster for 
Meteogroup, explained: ‘The reason it has been so wet in the South is 
because the jet stream has switched from its normal position just to the
 north of Scotland to down over southern England this month, and 
depressions follow that feature.

‘It’s a reversal of the average weather pattern,’ he said.

‘Normally it gets wetter as you go to the North West. This month it gets wetter as you go South.’
