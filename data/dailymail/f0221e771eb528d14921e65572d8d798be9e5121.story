Prolific: Anthony Hughes, who was jailed last February after committing 178 crimes, was caught stealing from the One Stop Shop and Tesco Express just months after his release

A prolific thief who was finally jailed for the first time after committing his 178th crime has continued to offend after stealing from two shops - just months after being released.

Anthony Hughes, 40, had a string of convictions for robbery, theft, burglary, shoplifting and aggravated vehicle theft.

Hughes was only jailed last February after he broke into his neighbour's house twice pinching things including washing up liquid and a new set of blinds.

But just months after being released from jail Hughes was caught stealing £15 worth of alcohol from One Stop Shop and £47 of beer and wine from Tesco in Cambridge.

Jailing him for 21 months in February 2011, Judge Anthony Bate told Cambridge Crown Court he had run out of patience with Hughes' offending.

Judge Bate told Hughes: 'You have a shocking record of offences. I have no confidence that a community order will have any success.

'The only way to tackle your alcohol problem will be in prison where the opportunities of access to alcohol will be minimal.'

Flynn Jennings, who prosecuted Hughes at Cambridge Magistrates' Court in 2006 for being more than twice the drink-drive limit in Cambridge, said he 'clearly has no regard for the law whatsoever'.

He told the court: 'This man has more "disqualified" and "drink-drivings" on his record than I have time to count.'

Hughes, from Trumpington, Cambs, pleaded guilty to the two new offences of theft at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

The court heard he stole £15 worth of alcohol from the One Stop Shop in Ditton Lane, Cambridge on September 7 and £47 of beer and wine from Tesco Express in East Road, Cambridge, on September 30.

His latest two crimes put Hughes in breach of an 18-month conditional discharge which was imposed by magistrates in January.

Hughes was released on unconditional bail and the case was adjourned for one week for further reports to be prepared.
