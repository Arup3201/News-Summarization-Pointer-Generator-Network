A police officer was injured and a cow shot dead yesterday after a three-hour operation to round up a herd of escaped cattle.

Eight of the beasts went on the run when the tractor and trailer being used to transport them overturned on near the M4 in Bradley Stoke, Bristol.

The startled cattle then began wreaking havoc in the surrounding area, damaging cars and gardens.

A policeman was taken to hospital and a cow was shot dead by a firearms officer after a herd of eight cattle went on the run in Bradley Stoke, Bristol, yesterday

The animals escaped after a tractor and trailer that was transporting them overturned near the M4 at 12.15pm

One of the animals was shot dead by a marksman at the request of the farmer who feared it wouldn't survive

Police arrived at the scene to try and round up the animals, but an officer suffered injuries when one of the spooked cows ran into him.

He was taken to a nearby hospital but was released after being assessed by doctors.

Craig Evry, Avon and Somerset police spokesman, said: 'There was an accident involving a trailer on Friday lunch time which led to a number of cows escaping.

'Officers attended the scene to try and round up the cows. One of the officers was injured after a cow ran into him and he was taken to Frenchay Hospital.

'He suffered bruising but escaped more serious injury because he had his body armour on.'

During the incident, which lasted from 12.15pm to 3pm, one of the animals was shot by a firearms officer at the request of the farmer after it became 'distressed' and the farmer believed it wouldn't survive.

A police spokesman was unable to say what had become of the dead cow, but added it would likely be up to the farmer to retrieve the body.

One twitter user messaged an unconfirmed report that the dead beast ended up on a forklift truck

Around the time of the incident, one Twitter user from Bradley Stoke messaged to say there was a dead cow being carried around on a forklift truck. The police were unable to comment on this report.

Twitter user Alex region said: 'Why the f*** is there a dead cow upside down on a forklift truck in the middle of Bradley Stoke?'

At least two police cars attended the incident, along with the firearms officer, and a police helicopter was also scrambled to deal with the runaway herd, although a police spokesman refused to confirm exactly how many officers had been involved.

Shocked residents returned home to find their gardens and cars gutted, including Keith Brett, 59, who was astounded when his CCTV footage showed the cow stampede.

It took officers three hours to round up the herd, by which time they had wrecked gardens and damaged cars

Roads had to be closed and other cars diverted while the farmer and police officers rounded up the cattle

The IT consultant, who lives with his wife, LeenaÂ  had been out for a walk when the cattle arrived outside their home, trampling over their garden and leaving cowpats behind.

He said: 'I couldn't believe it. They came right up to our door. Luckily they didn't panic, or they could have done a lot more damage.'

His wife added: 'It's just unbelievable. We came back from our walk to a total commotion.

'The cows and bulls had walked all the way through our close. There was cow mess everywhere and they had trampled on two cars.'

A number of cars were damaged by the rogue animals, including a Vauxhall Corsa, which was left with a dented bonnet after one of the animals ran over it.

The car owner, Jane Williams, 46, said: 'As I went to turn right at the bottom of the road the cows crossed my path.

'I parked on the road and looked up to the top where I could see some people and the police.

'They were massive animals but they were obviously terrified.

'They came through the side of the drive, smashing up my pots. They bashed into the car and I saw one go up on the car. The damage isn't too bad but it's got to be dealt with.'

Despite the damage, the receptionist saw the funny side, adding: 'It was absolutely amazing, coming up the road to see cows here.

'They churned up some gardens but when you invite cows into your cul-de-sac, what do you expect?'
