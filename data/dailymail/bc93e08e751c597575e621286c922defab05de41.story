Councils in England are demanding greater powers to veto new betting shops, and cut the high stakes on addictive roulette machines.

The powerful Local Government Association said councils were ‘frustrated’ by the proliferation of bookmakers, which they blame for problem gambling and anti-social behaviour.

They are calling for tough new powers to tackle ‘clustering’ of betting shops and reduce the risks from Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) which have been dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling.

Councils in England are demanding greater powers to veto new betting shops, and cut the high stakes on addictive roulette machines

There are already more than 30,000 FOBT machines in the UK.

Research published last week, funded by the industry, conceded that high stakes gambling impairs players’ decision-making and could cause them to spend beyond their means while on a losing streak.

The LGA, which represents all English councils, is calling for a new ‘cumulative impact test’ which would allow planners to reject applications for new betting shops if there is already a cluster of them.

They also call for licencing laws to be updated to include betting, so officials can take issues of problem gambling and anti-social behaviour into account when considering applications.

And lastly, they say the current £100-a-spin maximum stake should be brought in line with maximum stakes for other gambling machines, which is £2 in pubs and £5 in casinos.

The intervention comes after 93 English councils submitted individual requests to reduce the maximum stake and reject applications, for ministers to consider under the Sustainable Communities Act

Tony Page, the LGA’s Licensing Spokesman, said: ‘Councils are not anti-bookies but many are frustrated by limited powers available to them to act on community concerns and limit the number of shops opening up in their area.

‘A new cumulative impact test would rightly give councils the power to veto new shops in areas already saturated by betting shops if firms can’t prove a new shop would benefit the local economy.’

The intervention comes after 93 English councils submitted individual requests to reduce the maximum stake and reject applications, for ministers to consider under the Sustainable Communities Act.

The case for councils to tackle problem betting has become more urgent since it was recommended that Scotland be given far-reaching powers to tackle betting stakes and clustering of shops.

Mr Page said: ‘Concerns about betting shop clustering and proliferation of high-stake FOBTs do not stop at the border. English councils must be handed the same powers.’
