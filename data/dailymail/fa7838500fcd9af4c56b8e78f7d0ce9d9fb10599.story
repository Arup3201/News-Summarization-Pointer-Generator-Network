Rory McIlroy set his sights on more major glory as he made an emotional return to the golf club where his journey to sporting stardom began.

The 22-year-old record-breaking US Open winner said it was fantastic to be among old friends again as he arrived at Holywood Golf Club in County Down with his trophy tucked tightly under his arm.

McIlroy landed back in Northern Ireland last night after what he said had been a whirlwind few days following his triumph at Congressional in Maryland.

Hailing the sacrifices made by his 
parents Gerry and Rosie when he was a young golfer trying to make a name
for himself, he promised to do all he could to ensure they would enjoy 
more major victories in the future.

'It's fantastic to be back here to see all my friends, my family,' he said.

'I
can't thank my parents enough for what they've done for me and winning 
the US Open is only a tiny little bit of my appreciation for what 
they've done, so hopefully there's more trophies for them in the future 
and more things for us to share and celebrate.'

The
homecoming event in Holywood came a year after similar euphoric scenes 
in Portrush, 60 miles up the road, when McIlroy's compatriot and close 
friend Graeme McDowell won the same tournament.

'Graeme inspired me and gave me a lot of belief that I could do the same thing,' McIlroy added.

'If Graeme hadn't won last year I don't know if I would be standing here talking to you as a major champion.'

On his return, McIlroy said that the 
people of Northern Ireland deserve a peaceful future adding that he was 
sad to return home to fresh violence.

He said he hoped to be able to provide some positive worldwide headlines for the place he loves.

East Belfast, only a few miles from 
McIlroy's home in Holywood, Co Down, has been consumed by rioting over 
the last two nights as simmering tensions between loyalists and 
republicans spilled over.

The golfing sensation said his fellow countrymen and women deserve better.

'It's sad to see what's happened the 
last couple of nights. I know that 99.9% of the population don't want to
see that. And if I can just be a little bit of positivity in the news 
then that's great.

'I think everyone just wants to live in peaceful times, and I think Northern Ireland deserves it.'

In a region of numerous divisions, 
many played out in a sport context, McIlroy is one personality with 
legions of fans across communities.

He said he has a responsibility as a 
role model. 'I am very aware of the fact that I am going to be portrayed
as a role model for a lot of young people in Northern Ireland, and 
probably across the world.

'And I have to be very careful in 
what I say and what I do, and as long as I portray the right image for 
other people to look up to, that's all I can really do.'

After
spending two hours inside the clubhouse, where the walls are covered 
with pictures of his triumphs, McIlroy emerged onto the balcony to a 
rapturous welcome from fans waiting below.

He thanked them all for their support
over the 15 years he had been a member, even, he joked, when he was a 
seven-year-old annoying the club professional.

The
crowd then broke into a spontaneous verse of Stand up for the Ulsterman
- a take on the popular chant of Ulster Rugby, McIlroy's favourite 
team.

At that point the 
champion's friends popped the champagne corks and drenched the Major 
winner in bubbly, leaving just a little for the club's most famous 
member to savour.

He then walked outside to pose with the famous trophy on the greens he once trod from dawn to dusk as a boy.

McIlroy
said he owed the fans one after failing in the last round of the US 
Masters at Augusta National in April, despite going into the final round
with a four stroke lead.

'The support's been fantastic,' he said.

'Even before this tournament, at Augusta I knew how much everyone wanted me to win that.

'It
felt like this win was not just for myself, it was for everyone who 
supported me and all I can say is thank you to everyone who believed in 
me after what happened at Augusta.'

McIlroy,
who was accompanied to the club by childhood sweetheart Holly Sweeney, 
conceded soaring expectations of what he can achieve in the game would 
be tough to handle.

'It's going to be difficult,' he said.

'The first couple of weeks will be a 
bit of a challenge, but it's a nice position to be in, to have that 
pressure, to have that expectation.

'As
long I can stay focused on what I need to do, that is play good golf, 
and let everything else take care of itself, then I'll be okay.'

He
also said it was too early in his career to think about long-term 
goals, such as surpassing the 18 Major haul set by Jack Nicklaus or even
Tiger Woods's 14 titles.

'I've got my first one out of the way and now I'm looking for my second and that's all I can really do,' he said.

'I
can't really put a number on it. I've won one very early on in my 
career but at the same time I know how hard these things are to win and 
hopefully I will be able to win more in the future.

'But 18 Majors is an incredible achievement and it would take some very special golf to be able to beat that.'

The
young pretender to Woods's throne - some dub him the Celtic Tiger - 
said he looked forward to the US star's return from injury.

'The game of golf is much better with him there,' he said.

'It
would be great to go down the stretch with him, it would be something 
that I would really enjoy. I would enjoy the challenge and it's 
something that I've dreamt about for a long time.'
