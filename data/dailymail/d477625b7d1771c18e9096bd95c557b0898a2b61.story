They started to turn the town pink yesterday in the search for April Jones.

It began with three ribbons that the missing girl’s mother tied in bows to the front gate of their home.

Then came a few more in the main street, on windscreen wipers, around tree-trunks and lamp-posts, in shop doorways and on lapels and handbags.

By the time the hunt completed its fourth fruitless day yesterday it was impossible to walk more than a few paces in Machynlleth without encountering pink.

Even the landmark clock tower in the heart of town was draped in it.

Thus, in an extraordinary act of solidarity, the five-year-old’s favourite colour became a symbol of hope that she can be safely returned to her family.

The countless ribbons and swatches of pink also underlined a powerful community spirit – rarely encountered in many parts of Britain, but which hallmarked this remarkable little place from the moment hundreds of people came together to offer help in any way they could.

One question is always asked first when friends meet in the street: ‘Any news yet?’ Machynlleth is too big to be called a village but it feels like one.

More than 2,200 people live here and everyone seems to know each other. The butcher is a former mayor; several shopkeepers know April and her family personally; people call the bobbies by their first names. The little market town has deep and historic roots in Wales, and is claimed in some circles to be the principality’s ancient capital.

Yet its eclectic mix of inhabitants gives it a character unlike many other Welsh communities, coloured by the scores of people who visited as tourists and came back to live.

It has an almost bohemian atmosphere and has long been a magnet for hippies, environmentalists, ecologists – anyone with a love of the unspoilt countryside and spectacular mountain backdrops.

The Centre for Alternative Technology, which aims ‘to empower people to live a more sustainable life’, was founded in 1973 on the site of a disused quarry and draws visitors from around the globe.

Yesterday outside the vegan and vegetarian Quarry Café in the main street, Craig Evans sat in the welcome sunshine and pinned a pink ribbon to his pullover. He moved here 20 years ago from Surrey and now considers himself a local. 

He had just volunteered to help search for April but was told by police that such help was no longer needed.

Ignoring the advice, he and a friend spent three hours searching anyway with the friend’s spaniel, examining outbuildings and lock-up garages they believed might not have been checked thoroughly on day one.

‘I actually felt guilty sitting at home doing nothing,’ he told me.

‘Every time before I turn the TV or radio on I get a sick feeling that there’s going to be bad news. Then I think it could be good news. But when there’s no news, I feel I have to do something, anything, to help.’

The ‘pink for April’ initiative took off in response to a Facebook appeal by April’s mother Coral Jones, who asked people to wear pink as a tangible sign that no one was giving up hope. ‘Please keep looking for April,’ she wrote. ‘She needs to come home.’

Some users of the social network site changed their online photographs to pink ribbons to show support.

Poignantly, the campaign mirrored the sea of yellow ribbons that grew around Kate and Gerry McCann’s home at the height of the search for missing Madeleine. Cathy Jenkins, shopping in Machynlleth, said the wait for news had been so agonising that being asked to participate even in something symbolic ‘comes as something of a relief’.

Most of the pink material spreading over Machynlleth yesterday came from Wheeler’s fabric and haberdashery in the centre of town. Sam Wheeler couldn’t make the little pink ribbons fast enough.

About a hundred disappeared in a couple of hours. ‘I’ve lost track of how many we’ve distributed but I think I’ve probably given out every bit of pink in the shop,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t just carry on working as normal. Everyone here is doing something if they can. It’s that kind of place.’

Across the road, 16-year-old sixth 
formers Heini Jones and Rebecca Vaughan were tying a long pink drape 
into a bow around railings at the foot of the clock tower.

Nearby was a ‘kidnapped’ appeal poster showing April in a pretty pink dress.

Both
teenagers are friends of April’s sister Jazmin. ‘It’s just our way of 
showing hope, and that we’re all pulling together and thinking of 
April,’ Heini said.  In the desperate days since April was abducted, 
regular services have been held at both the town’s central churches.

So many people want to pray for April, however, that the doors have remained open all day.

The Rev Kathleen Rogers, vicar of St Peter’s, provided a book for messages of support and goodwill and it has been filling up by the hour.

‘It feels as if the whole town is carrying the weight on its shoulders,’ she said.

‘There is a sense of urgency now but there is still hope. Until someone tells us otherwise, April is alive – and we have to find her.’
