Two young Pennsylvania newlyweds lured a stranger to his death with a Craigslist ad because they wanted to fulfill their long-time fantasy of killing someone together.

Sunbury police said 22-year-old Elytte Barbour was charged Friday night in the death of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara. Barbour's 18-year-old wife, Miranda, was charged Wednesday.

Investigators said Elytte Barbour confessed to police the couple planned the killing. He previously told The Daily Item of Sunbury his wife acted in self-defense when LaFerrara, who was married, groped her after hiring her as a ‘companion.’

Victim: Tryo LaFerrara, 42, pictured here with his wife, Colleen, on their wedding day in 2011, was found butchered in an alley with 20 stab wounds last month

According to authorities, the Selinsgrove couple picked up LaFerrara November 11, three weeks after they got married, for a sexual encounter in a parking lot.

Mr Barbour allegedly choked LaFerrara with a cable cord while his petite, bespectacled spouse repeatedly stabbed him. LaFerrara's body covered in 20 knife wounds was found dumped in an alley.

The Barbours had recently moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after tying the knot October 22.

LaFerra married his girlfriend of eight years, Colleen Keeney, in June 2011. The couple did not have children. According to his obituary, LaFerrara was employed as the senior resident engineer at the Lycoming County Landfill

The couple's arrests comes after Richard Beasley
was given the death penalty in April this year after luring three men 
to an Ohio farm by using Craigslist job posts before killing them in 
cold blood.

Sunbury Police 
Chief Steve Mazzeo said Friday that on November 11, Elytte Barbour told 
detectives that he was hiding under a blanket in the backseat of his 
wife's red Honda CRV when they went to pick up Troy LaFerrara for his 
rendezvous with the 18-year-old married escort.

When
Miranda Barbour gave her husband a signal, Elytte pounced on LaFerrarra
from behind, wrapping a cord around his neck and tightening it as his 
wife knifed the 42-year-old man all over his body. 

Sex worker: The teen-mom's husband said he knew about her habit of meeting men on the internet and sleeping with them for money

Mr Barbour has been charged with criminal homicide, aggravated assault, simple assault and criminal conspiracy and possession of instruments of crime.

The 22-year-old man told police that he and his wife had plotted to kill someone in the past, but without success. It was not until they came across LaFerrara on Craigslist that their plan finally came together.

‘LaFerrara was just the one with whom it worked,’ Elytte Barbour told police.

Earlier
this week, Miranda told police that she drove alone to a department 
store and bought bleach wipes and other cleaning supplies to wash her 
blood-spattered car.

But following his arrest, Elytte Barbour told investigators that he was the one who went to the store.

After cleaning up the gore, the couple drove to a strip club to celebrate Elytte Barbour's 22nd birthday.

According
to Elytte Barbour, his wife has an 18-month-old baby from a man who has
died under what police are now considering suspicious circumstances. 

Police arrested Miranda Barbour after LeFerrara's mutilated body was found in a side street in Sunbury, Pennsylvania.

After
a three-week investigation, officers traced the dead man's cell phone 
call history, they found the teenager was the last person to have spoken
him before his death.

Upon agreeing to be interviewed, Barbour admitted that she had met LaFerrara November 11 after setting up the meeting online.

She told prosecutors that she would regularly use Craigslist to meet men for 'companionship', often being paid for the meetings up to $850, according to her husband.

But in her first interview, the mom of one insisted that, despite setting up the meeting at the Susquehanna Valley Mall, Hummels Wharf, she didn't go through with it because she was too scared.

Later, Barbour’s husband and friend were then interviewed and told officers they knew Barbour she met men who she had encountered online, and that she carried a pocket knife for her own protection.

But just a day after her first questioning, Barbour voluntarily went to Selinsgrove state police barracks and asked to speak with investigators with an attorney present.

In her second version of events, she said she met LaFerrara on Craigslist and after emailing back and forth, the two decided to meet at the mall, police said.

LaFerrara entered Barbour’s vehicle, and once they arrived in Sunbury, LaFerrara told Barbour to pull over, police said.

Original sinner: The first 'Craigslist killer' Richard Beasley, above, was convicted in April after posting job vacancies on the site which used the promise of work on an Ohio farm to lure three men to their deaths

Beasley, 53, was convicted of teaming up with a teenager in 2011 to use the promise of jobs on a southeast Ohio farm to lure the men to their deaths.

A self-proclaimed street preacher, he killed three men, all of who answered a Craigslist ad for a non-existent job.

The slain men were Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Va.; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon. All were looking for a fresh start in life, prosecutors said repeatedly during the trial.

The murderer was sentenced to death in April this year, after hearing the details of his crime, Judge Lynne Callahan said 'I think I'm going to be sick.

Barbour told police that she parked and LaFerrara began to grope her, touch her private areas and put his hands around her throat.

According to the teen, it was then that she reached for the knife and began to stab LaFerrara in a frenzied attack. police said.

She said she blacked out and didn’t remember the amount of the times she stabbed him, according to police. She made no mention of her husband playing a role in the killing, or even being present in the car.

Barbour then drove away with the man 'choking and gasping for air', police said.

She drove around the city and found the alley behind Catawissa Avenue.

Controversial: The site will come under fresh scrutiny after its role in the latest death

She got out of the vehicle and walked around to the passenger’s door, which LaFerrara was leaning against, opened the door and watched him fall out, police said.

Before driving off, the teenager took the man's wallet, the report said.

At a secluded spot, she cleaned away as much of the blood as she could before driving on to join her husband at his birthday party in a strip club.

It is alleged she threw the knife which was used in the attack into the Susquehanna River, which runs through Sunbury and Selinsgrove.
