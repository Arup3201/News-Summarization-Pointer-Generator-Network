She's already won the heart of the nation but the Duchess of Cambridge has shown just why she's so well thought of by giving a glimpse of her compassionate side.

Kate, who is patron of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH) made a private visit to the Treehouse hospice in Ipswich and has paid tribute to the 'remarkable' work of children’s hospices.

In a statement released on EACH’s Twitter account @EACH-hospices to mark Children’s Hospice Week, the Duchess said: 'Around the clock support is crucial for children receiving palliative care.

Private visit: The Duchess of Cambridge, who is patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), met six-year-old Charlie Middleton and his mum Cheryl Middleton during a visit to Treehouse hospice in Ipswich earlier this month

'They and their families often need help every hour of every day, both in hospices and at home.

'As patron of EACH, I have seen first-hand this remarkable and varied work and just how vital the support of staff and volunteers can be to the families of children with life limiting conditions.

'It has been wonderful to see the fantastic public support for Children’s Hospice Week over the last few days. Please continue supporting your local children’s hospice in whatever way you can.'

Children’s Hospice Week has been marked by a #WeCare247 Twitter campaign to highlight the complex round-the-clock care that seriously ill children require.

Compassion: Kate, who is patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), has made a private visit to the Treehouse hospice in Ipswich

Kate visited the hospice privately earlier this month but the pictures have now been revealed.

The Treehouse hospice has six bedrooms for children and young people and accommodation for families to use for overnight stays.

There is 
also a multi-sensory studio, hydrotherapy pool, music room, play areas, 
sensory garden, a woodland walk and specialist outdoor play equipment.

The Duchess looked stylish, as always, wearing a pink paisley Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress, a designer she has turned to many times, whose designs retail for around £300. 

It's a hit: The £292 Diane Von Furstenberg patterned wrap dress the Duchess of Cambridge wore to visit the Blue Mountains in Sydney sold out in eight minutes after photos of Kate appeared online

Kate last wore a £292 new season blue and 
white patterned wrap dress from the high-end designer to visit the Blue 
Mountains town of Winnmalee, just outside of Sydney during her Royal tour there in April.

She paired the dress with £245 
dark-blue suede Russell & Bromley wedge heels and carried a small 
clutch in her hands as she toured the bush fire affected area.

The
 31-year-old is known for making fashion fly off the shelves as fans aim
 to emulate her style, but the blue and white wrap dress sold out at a 
particularly surprising speed of just eight minutes, according to 
fashion website Go Fug Yourself.

Royal duties: Yesterday, the Duchess of Cambridge met Marion Body, who worked at Bletchley Park and knew the Duchess's grandmother
