The NFL is serving up a full slate of pigskin action on Thursday while many fans in the US will be tucking into their Thanksgiving turkeys.

The league decided to go back to the basics this year and all three Thanksgiving tilts will feature divisional rivals from the NFC facing off in match-ups with major implications for the postseason...

Chicago Bears vs Detroit Lions

In the first game of the day, the Chicago Bears  travel about 270 miles east for a game at Ford Field in Detroit against the Lions.

The Bears roll into Motown riding a two-game winning streak and have seemingly righted the ship after they allowed more than 50 points in two consecutive losses to the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers.

Chicago got two touchdowns from running back Matt Forte during a 21-13 win over Tampa Bay on Sunday and the Bears defense recorded a season-high five sacks. Much-maligned quarterback Jay Cutler didn't have a great day at the office (17 completions, 130 yards, one touchdown), but he didn't turn the ball over and let the running game and defense take control.

It would be surprising if Cutler was able to turn in another turnover-free performance against the Lions on Thursday.

Detroit limps into the home game after getting outclassed by the Arizona Cardinals and the Patriots and their top-tier defense will be playing with extra motivation after surrendering 34 points in New England on Sunday. Cutler is no stranger to turning the ball over and Detroit will likely get after him early and often to limit his ability to throw downfield.

The Lions offense, which has been limited to five field goals and only 15 points during the last two games, also needs to get back on track and Chicago is seemingly the perfect opponent to do that against.

Detroit's passing attack should have no problem making mashed potatoes out of Chicago's 29th-ranked secondary and wide receivers Golden Tate and Calvin Johnson will be gobbling up the yards in bunches. Johnson has scored in six of the seven career games he has played on Thanksgiving and averaged nearly five catches and 70 receiving yards against the Bears throughout his career so there's a fairly good chance he'll be rolling like a gravy train with biscuit wheels on Thursday.

During the second game of the day, the 8-3 Philadelphia Eagles travel to Dallas to take on the 8-3 Cowboys in a battle for first place in the NFC East.

Both teams are coming off big wins  and Thursday is the first of two meetings the teams will have in the next three weeks.

The Eagles have been slightly better on offense and Dallas has been a shade better on defense thus far, but the teams are fairly evenly-matched and this game should provide a cornucopia of excitement.

As is often the case in the NFL, this game will likely come down to quarterback play.

Philadelphia's Mark Sanchez will make his fourth start in a row for injured Nick Foles while Tony Romo will be back under center for the third straight game after sitting out for a week because of a back injury.

LeSean McCoy has 879 yards this season, and is making up for lost time after a slow start

Sanchez has filled in admirably for Foles with seven touchdowns and three consecutive 300-yard passing games, but he has tossed six interceptions. He's also had his struggles on Thanksgiving in the past - think butt fumble - and the Cowboys may want to force the former Jet to make plays while focusing their efforts on shutting down LeSean McCoy and Darren Sproles in the running game. The 'Boys aren't great at creating turnovers, but Sanchez will almost certainly toss a pick or two.

On the other hand, Romo is usually good for an interception or two of his own, or least he has been in the past. However Dallas' reliance on DeMarco Murray and its running game has allowed Romo to relax a bit in the pocket and he has responded favourably. The veteran signal-caller has 22 touchdowns and only six interceptions this year and that ratio is the biggest reason why his quarterback rating sits at 80.5, the best mark of his ten-year career.

Romo hasn't thrown an interception in more than a month and has seven scores in his last two games. The Eagles will probably get to him at some point, but the Cowboys should be able to stuff Sanchez and serve Philadelphia its first road loss of the year.

Tony Romo hands off to DeMarco Murray in an all-too familiar sight this year - he has 268 carries

The first two games of the day should be good, but football fans will want to have their popcorn, or pumpkin pie, ready for the evening game at Levi's Stadium.

When the 49ers last played the Seahawks ten months ago for the NFC Championship, the game ended with Seattle stopping a late San Francisco drive to advance to the Super Bowl. It ended with a play in the end zone that caused a beef between Richard Sherman and Michael Crabtree that is still going and made the feisty defensive back a legit star. There was also the whole Erin Andrews situation which resulted out of that game and head coaches Jim Harbaugh and Pete Carroll don't pretend to like one another.

In addition to Thursday's game being a rehashing of all those trimmings, there's also a good chance the losing team won't be headed to the playoffs.

The emergence of the Cardinals atop the division means that Seattle and San Francisco are likely battling for a single spot in the postseason. The teams do play each other again in Week 15 and the winner on Thanksgiving will have a big advantage heading into that match-up because of the earlier head-to-head victory. Both teams will enter Thursday with 7-4 records but one will emerge at 7-5, a mark which would not currently be good enough for a wildcard spot.

Despite a schism with head coach Pete Carroll, Marshawn Lynch keeps pounding away for the Seahawks

Seattle has not displayed the same level of play that won them the Super Bowl last season, but the team is still near the top of the league in defense and their running game ranks best in the NFL. Quarterback Russell Wilson has been able to make up for shortcomings in Seattle's passing game by beating teams with his feet and the Seahawks have won four of its last five games after a rocky start to the year.

San Francisco have won three in a row but the team has struggled against quality opponents  and this will be a huge test for them. The 49ers barely squeaked by a fairly terrible Washington team  and quarterback Colin Kaepernick's play was inconsistent at best. He has only thrown for 300 or more yards once this season and simply has not done enough to justify the massive contract he signed during the offseason.

That said, if Kaepernick can provide a San Francisco treat and help the 49ers eke out a win against the Seahawks the deal will look as if it's worth every penny.
