India have been punished for a slow over-rate during their shambolic fifth-Test defeat by England.

The International Cricket Council has fined India after the Tourists ended three overs short of their target  when time allowances were taken into consideration.

Rules stipulate players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for every over they are behind - with the captain taking a double punishment.

That means India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni relinquishes 60 per cent of his fee with his  team-mates  losing 30 per cent.

Dhoni will be suspended for one match should his side commit another over-rate offence in the next 12 months. 

India accepted the ruling without appeal.

It proves it only gets worse for India, after England turned a 1-0 deficit into a 3-1 triumph on Sunday.
