When you weigh a whopping 36 stone, it’s probably not the brightest idea to go wandering across a frozen lake.

And this moose found itself in a spot of serious trouble when the ice collapsed below and the water began to freeze around it as it struggled to get out.

But help was at hand in the shape of a group of kind-hearted locals.

Armed with just a chainsaw and rope, a team of eight people freed the female moose in a heroic feat.

A terrified moose slipped through ice and was trapped in frozen Muncho Lake for 45 minutes before an incredible rescue

The female moose, weighing nearly 36 stone, bobbed her head above the icy water and awaited to be freed from the ice

Passing travellers, truck drivers and locals came to her rescue using a chainsaw and rope

The animal had been trapped in frozen Muncho Lake in northern British Columbia, Canada for 45 minutes before a group of passing travellers, truck drivers and locals spotted her bobbing head above the ice.

They started off by using a chainsaw to cut the ice around her, and then tied a rope around the trapped moose before they pulled her to safety after 15 minutes and four attempts.

The rescue was caught on camera by Canadian wildlife and nature photographer, Chris Gale, who spied the moose in the lake while he was on a trip with friends Ryan, Jason, and Matthew.

Gale, 31, from Fort Nelson, BC, said: 'Every spring my friends and I go on a river boating trip up the Alaska Highway and as we were driving by Muncho Lake we noticed a bunch of people on the lake and a head of a moose sticking out of the ice.

'In the spring time, when the snow starts to melt, the ice on the lake starts to get rotten. So, as this moose walked out onto the ice, she fell through with no way out.

'I have never seen anything like it.' 

Rescuers cut ice around her and then tied a rope around the trapped animal before a team of eight pulled her out by hand

The rescue took four attempts before she was successfully pulled free from the frozen lake

Lucky to be alive! Once the moose was freed and the rope was cut from her neck she had a few injuries from the incident

Working on perilously thin ice and with a potentially aggressive moose, the rescuers were well aware of the challenging conditions they faced.

Saving the moose was dangerous and the rescuers were all worried about their friend Matthew, who they hoped did not slip through the ice while trying to get the rope around the animal's neck, said Chris.

'The ice was so rotten and the lake was particularly deep in this spot, so we tied a rope around Matthew's waist in case he fell through the surface,' he said. 'We sent him out on the ice as he was the smallest guy and we hoped the ice would support him.

'The moose was scared at first because one of the guys had a chainsaw cutting a trail in the ice, but once we got her out she calmed down and let us cut the rope off.'

Chris said the moose walked into the mountains and stopped to look back 'like she was saying thanks' before continuing her journey

Following the ordeal, many people have hailed Chris and his friends as heroes for saving the animal, he said.

'We were just doing what anyone would do,' said Chris. 'After we got her out of the ice, Matthew cut the rope, and then she simply walked into the mountains stopping to look back at us like she was saying thanks, then she continued on her journey.

'I would just like to say that this kind of thing happens a lot on frozen lakes around the world, we just happened to be in the right place at the right time when this moose fell through, she was lucky.'
