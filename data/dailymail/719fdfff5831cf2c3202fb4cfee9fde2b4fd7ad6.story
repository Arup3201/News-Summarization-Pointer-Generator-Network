Jaguar is to live up to its ‘good to be bad’ reputation by providing a 200mph supercar for the new James Bond movie Spectre.

A host of villainous-looking 4X4 Land Rovers and Range Rovers are also being supplied by British manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover for the agent 007’s latest big screen.

The ‘baddy’s’ Jaguar’s C-X75 prototype will form part of a spectacular chase scene through Rome alongside 007’s already-revealed Aston Martin DB10, one of  just 10 cars being specially created for the movie.

Jaguar is providing a 200mph petrol-electric hybrid supercar for the new James Bond movie Spectre

The ‘baddy’s’ C-X75 prototype will form part of a spectacular chase scene through Rome, it has emerged

The sleek C-X75 vehicles used in filming have been built in collaboration with Williams Advanced Engineering facility in Oxfordshire, England.

For the movie it is likely to be fitted with fitted with Jaguar’s supercharged 5.0-litre V8 engine, instead of using its existing hybrid.

The model had been due to go into full production with a near £1million price-tag but Jaguar pulled the plug because of the recession. Its appearance in the latest Bond movie may persuade bosses to reverse that decision.

At the time the vehicle was unveiled, it was said to have been capable of 0-60mph in less than three seconds.

It was also billed as having exceptionally low fuel consumption, with carbon dioxide emissions will be as low as those from a Toyota Prius family car.   

Just 250 were due to be built between 2013 and 2015 as part of a collaboration with the Williams Formula 1 team, combining race engineering with cutting-edge environmental technology.

The vehicles used for the film have been provided by Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations arm – the firm’s version of ‘Q-branch’ - which builds highly specialised versions of its cars including bespoke commissions, heritage products and branded goods.

This includes high performance production models for both Jaguar and Land Rover, vehicle personalisation products and low volume, high value limited edition models for both brands.

Some shots of blown-up, overturned and on-fire Land Rovers have already surfaced from shooting scenes in the snow in Obertilliach, Austria. 

In the new Spectre movie, a cryptic message from Bond’s past sends him on a trail to uncover the sinister organisation.

While Bond’s boss ‘M’ battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to ‘reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre’, said movie insiders. 

James Bond's car in the new film will be this Aston Martin DB10, which will not be mass produced

The move is named after the fictional Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion, headed by 007’s nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. 

A Jaguar Land Rover spokesman said: ‘Continuing Jaguar Land Rover’s successful involvement with the Bond franchise, Jaguar C-X75, Range Rover Sport SVR and Land Rover Defender Big Foot to feature in new James Bond movie, Spectre.

Scenes including the heavily modified versions of Land Rover Defender & Range Rover Sport SVR have already been filmed in Austria.

The Range Rover Sport SVR is the fastest and most powerful Land Rover ever.

Powered by 550 horse-power 5 litre supercharged petrol engines they can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and on to an electronically limited top speed of 162mph.

The Land Rover Big Foots were constructed by Special Operations with huge 37-inch diameter off-road tyres to tackle the extreme terrain. They also feature bespoke suspension systems and enhanced body protection.

 Daniel Craig turns into a gun-wielding agent on the set of the film, which is due for release in October

Managing director of Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations John Edwards, said: ‘This is an exciting partnership for Jaguar Land Rover and an opportunity to demonstrate the fantastic capabilities of the Special Operations team.’’

Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles have been involved in a succession of Bond films. Most recently in 2012 the rugged Defender 110 Double Cab Pick Up was driven by field agent Eve Moneypenny in the opening sequence to Skyfall.

The movie is directed by Sam Mendes and written by John Logan, Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and is due in cinemas in October.

The new cast was only announced in December, with Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Monica Belushi, Dave Bautista and Andrew Scott lined up to star.

Waltz has been widely expected to assume the role of legendary villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, head of the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion, but the Oscar winning actor insists his part is more complex than speculation suggests.

Asked if he would head the fictional terrorism organisation, Christoph told Collider: ‘No. No. It's more interesting than that.’

Spectre is the 24th James Bond adventure, from Albert R. Broccoli’s EON Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment.
