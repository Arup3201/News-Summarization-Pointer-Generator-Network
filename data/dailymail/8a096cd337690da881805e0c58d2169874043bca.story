It was an excruciating moment that left some wondering whether Joe Biden was acting a little strange.

Having leaned in towards the already awkward-looking teenage daughter of a senator, he tries to kiss her on the head - to which she recoils.

But 13-year-old Margaret Coons insists she doesn't think the Vice-President is creepy.

The incident was among a number of awkward moments at the swearing-in ceremony of the new Congress last week. 

Pained: After posing with the family of Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware (left), Biden leaned down to whisper something to Coons's daughter Margaret. She did not seem to enthused by what he had to say

Turned away: Perhaps the most excruciatingly awkward part of the ceremony was when Biden tried to kiss Coons's daughter Margaret on the head and she turned away 

Miss Coons's father, Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware, said of his daughter: 'No, she doesn't think the vice president is creepy.

'He's known my kids their whole lives. Joe was just being thoughtful.'

He told Fox News Sunday that Mr Biden was simply leaning forward to offer her support for what would be a busy day in the public eye.

He said: 'I could hear him. 

'He was whispering some encouragement to her about how when he was sworn in and his own daughter Ashley was 13 and she felt awkward and uncomfortable and he was encouraging her about how to get through a day with lots of cameras and lots of folks watching.

'He was being Joe. He was being thoughtful and he was being sweet.'

Stale jokes: Biden later used the same line when he met freshman Senator Joni Ernst's (in red) teenage daughter Libby (left) 

Earlier, Biden's humor had taken a somewhat creepier tone when he was introduced to Utah Senator Orrin Hatch's teenage granddaughter Emily.   

Biden commented: 'I hope you have a big fence around the house!'

The comment was made as Biden posed with the 80-year-old Republican senator's large family, on the day he officially became president pro tempore of Congress. 

Biden thought the joke about the girl's good looks so funny, he whipped it out again when he met the daughter of freshman Senator Joni Ernst. 

Pictures from the event show Biden with his arm around the republican's daughter Libby as Senator Ernst places her hand on a Bible to be sworn in.  

Getting close: Biden was pictured with his arm around Libby as her mother was sworn in. The VP probably didn't make a great impression on Ernst, since he called her by her husband's name - Gail (in red tie) - when they met last week

He probably won't be calling Senator Ernst up for favors anytime soon. 

In addition to the strange comment towards her daughter, Biden also got the senator's name wrong at first - calling Joni by her husband's name, Gail. 

Throughout the rest of the day, Biden continued to throw out flattery left and right. 

'As they say in southern Delaware, 'Boy, you married up,'' he told the husband of Maine republican Susan Collins. Biden has spent more than three decades in the senate.
