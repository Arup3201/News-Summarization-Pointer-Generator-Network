The third Georgia victim of a rare flesh-eating bacteria underwent a sixth surgery as doctors begin to rebuild his groin after removing two pound of tissue in an attempt to fight the deadly disease.

Bobby Vaughn, 33, says the infection that set in after he received a cut on his side nearly killed him because he didn't take care of it quickly enough.

The man from Catersville, Georgia, is recovering at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, the same place where Aimee Copeland, 24, lost her leg, her foot and both hands to the disease after it spread rapidly across her body.

Surgeons are beginning to use skin grafts to repair the open wounds that he has after a half-dozen surgeries, he told the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

'They have to rebuild my groin area, he said. 'But I'm feeling much better now.'

Mr Vaughn's condition has improved from 'critical' to 'good' after being admitted to Doctors Hospital, spokeswoman Barclay Bishop told Mail Online.

However, Mr Vaughn, a landscaper, said his stubbornness almost cost him his life.

After he received a small cut on his thigh, near his groin, while cutting weeds, Mr Vaughn said he started to throw up. When the gash swelled, he went to the hospital in Cartersville.

Two pounds of flesh: Mr Vaugh had to endure five surgeries, but doctors believe they have removed the infected tissue

Aimee Copeland, pictured, a 24-year-old graduate student at the University of West Georgia, suffered a nasty cut on her thigh when her zipline broke and she plunged into the Little Tallapoosa River, east of Atlanta.

Doctors stapled the wound shut, but it became infected with a flesh-eating bacteria on May 4.

Surgeons amputated her leg, but by then the disease had spread rapidly.

On Saturday, they also amputated her foot and both hands.

Now she finally appears to be on the mend, despite being in critical condition.

She breathed on her own for 10 hours on Sunday, the first time since being admitted to the hospital.

Lana Kuykendall, 36, pictured with her husband, had been home just 13 hours after giving birth to twins at  Emory University Hospital when she noticed a painful spot on her leg last on May 11.

Mrs Kuykendall is a paramedic and her husband Darren is a firefighter, so they recognized quickly that something was wrong.

Her husband rushed her to Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina.

While they waited to be seen, the couple watched in horror as the spot on Mrs Kuykendall's leg grew a quarter of an inch in one hours.

She has now undergone seven surgeries to remove the infected tissue and is currently listed in critical condition.

Doctors there put him on antibiotics and wanted to keep him for observation. 'Being the man that I am,' Vaughn told the Journal Constitution, he refused and went home.

That's when he took a dramatic turn for the worse. The wound swelled from the size of a peanut to the size of a grapefruit, he said. 

The next day, he went back to the hospital where doctors told him he was close to death. They rushed him into surgery and began cutting out the infected flesh.

Despite the public attention on the horrific disease, Ms Bishop said her hospital, which has a nationally-recognized burn and wound clinic, sees about 50 cases of it each year.

The nation focused on flesh-eating bacterial infection, called necatoriasis fasciitis, as Ms Copeland's terrifying ordeal.

Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat.

The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.

The graduate student caught it after cutting herself on a homemade zip that broke and sent her plunging into Georgia's Little Tallapoosa River at the beginning of this month. 

Her father announced on Sunday that she was able to breathe for 10 hours without a respirator, a new milestone in her long road to recovery. 

Lana Kuykendall, 36, contracted the condition May 11 just hours leaving Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she gave birth to twins.

She is in critical but stable condition after undergoing seven operations to remove dead and infected tissue from her leg.

Doctors say that despite the strange surge in cases of the rare disease, the three infections are not related.

Mr Vaughn said he realized immediately after he received the cut that something was wrong.

'I just out of the blue wasn't feeling real well, and I went over and sat in my truck for a minute, and I was feeling real hot, and I started vomiting, you know, so we just stopped for the day,' he told CBS Atlanta.

Like Miss Copeland and Mrs Kuyrkendal, Mr Vaughn was rushed into emergency surgery, where doctors cut out as much of the infected tissue as they could.

Vaughn said he's slowly recovering after doctors managed to stem the spread of the rare infection.

'I was told I was just a day or two from being dead or losing entire parts of my body,' he told NBC 11.
