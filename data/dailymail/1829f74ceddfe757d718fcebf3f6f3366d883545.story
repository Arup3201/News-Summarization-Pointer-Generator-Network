From a rainbow on the surface of a fruit fly's brain to the last tree to be felled in a once great forest, a series of intriguing photographs showcasing the work of young researchers have gone on show.

The pictures are part of an exhibition at the Cambridge Science Festival, which aims to open up the world of scientific study to the general public.

They have been compiled by researchers from the life sciences subjects at the University of Cambridge.

Beautiful firework? An ultra-magnified image by Mahalia Page, which captures how hair follicles help heal wounds by supplying new cells, is one of a series of images by researchers from the life sciences subjects at the University of Cambridge.

Alexander Hackman is studying the bio-mechanics of how insects clean themselves for his PhD.

His picture might look like an abstract piece of modern art, but it is actually an ultra-magnified image showing a polystyrene particle that is five times smaller than the diameter of a human hair attached to a cleaning hair removed from an ant's antenna.

He created the first of its kind image using a special microscope in a bid to show how insects keep healthy using specialised cleaning devices.

Konrad Wagstyl used a new method to look at the cerebral cortex. The result is The Jigsaw Brain (pictured), which is a colourful image showing how the brain is randomly split into a thousand pieces, to highlight how researchers identify the same areas of different brains

Another picture, taken by Sarah Luke, shows a mighty Belian iron-wood trunk lying on a forest floor in the state of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo, which is all that is left of a site that has been cleared to make way for an oil palm plantation.

‘Malaysia is a leading producer of palm oil and the industry has provided a hugely valuable boost to the economy and many jobs,’ she explained.

‘However, vast areas of forest have been lost, posing major threats to biodiversity.

‘It is unusual to see such a large trunk left abandoned in a plantation, and this offers a particularly poignant reminder of the forest that has been lost.’

Jun Liu's image (pictured) is described as a rainbow 'Milky Way at the brain surface' and shows the blood brain barrier of a fruit fly rendered at super resolution

To create another technicolour image of a brain, Konrad Wagstyl used a new method to look at the cerebral cortex.

The result is The Jigsaw Brain, which is a colourful image showing how the brain is randomly split into a thousand pieces, to highlight how researchers identify the same areas of different brains.

Another image by Mahalia Page shows how hair follicles help heal wounds by supplying new cells and Tobias Waeur produced an image showing the molecular structure of the protein Parkin, which has been shown to cause Parkinson's disease.

The images will be shown at the Cormack Room University Centre in Cambridge between 12.30pm and 3pm tomorrow and entry is free.
