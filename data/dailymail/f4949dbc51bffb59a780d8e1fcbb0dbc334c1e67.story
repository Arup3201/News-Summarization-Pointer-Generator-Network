British viewers will miss the first 15 minutes of Saturday's game due to broadcasting regulations.

He's done it before can he do it again? No, not that… the goal on the comeback or on the debut. 

Luis Suarez will combine his debut and his comeback this Saturday and he will do it in the biggest fixture in world football – theClasico.

Barcelona supporters are hopeful the precedent of last season will mean he makes an instant impact on his return to competitive action. After serving his 10-game ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic, Suarez scored twice in his first match back.

How Barcelona may line up against Real Madrid

That afternoon a Sunderland side still reeling from the mismanagement of Paolo Di Canio and under the temporary stewardship of Kevin Ball were the opponents. It wasn't the Sunderland team beaten by eight goals by Ronald Koeman's Southampton, it was an even worse version and Suarez took full advantage.

He tapped in a Daniel Sturridge cross in the first half and lifted his shirt to reveal the words 'Welcome Benja' to mark the birth of his son Benjamin. So confident was he of scoring again he wore a different 'Welcome Benja' shirt under his Liverpool shirt in the second half and duly scored again from another Sturridge assist.

One of the advantages for him that day was that although he was coming back from a long lay-off he was returning to very familiar surroundings. He had built-up a good understanding with Daniel Sturridge and when the SAS got going again, it was as if Suarez had never been away. 

That will not be the case this time. SNM is a fledgling threesome and apart from training sessions, there has been no opportunity for Barcelona to play Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi together.

What they have been able to do however is ensure that the system employed by the team fits perfectly with the incoming Suarez. 

Messi has played ever so slightly deeper and whoever has played on the right of the front three, where Suarez can expect to be used if he starts the game, has been given license to run into the centre-forward territory which will suit the Uruguayan perfectly.

The omen of the brace on his comeback is not the only precedent that Barca fans are hanging on to. Suarez also has a habit of scoring on his debut. He scored on his league debut and his home debut for Ajax and he hit the back of the net against Stoke on his first Liverpool outing.

He came off the bench on 63 minutes and had notched by minute 79. Dirk Kuyt and Andy Carroll were his fellow strikers in the those early weeks at Anfield. Neymar and Messi will be joining him on the pitch at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.
