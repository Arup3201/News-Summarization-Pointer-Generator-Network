Many boys dream they'll one day play in an NFL team or serve in the Navy.

Running-back Eric Kettani does both - but New England Patriots fans will be disappointed to hear he has been ordered back to duty with the Navy.

Kettani arrived at the USS Klakring, a frigate in Jacksonville, Florida, on Friday after being released from the Patriots practice squad.

‘I love my country and I’m happy to serve it, but I’m also happy to be a New England Patriot,’ the 24-year-old told ESPN.

The Patriots had signed Kettani, who played full-back at Navy, in May 2009 and placed him on the reserve and military list two months later.

Kettani, who was appealing the Navy’s decision, was later activated from that list, released after training camp and signed to the practice squad.

By releasing him instead of returning him to the reserve list they can bring him back if ‘other things get worked out’, Patriots coach Bill Belichick said.

‘Once he’s on reserve, then he’s out for the year,’ he added.

'Playing for the Patriots was a dream, and he was living it. He did sign up for the Navy and I’m sure serving is an honour. But in this one instance, it would have been nice to allow him to keep playing.'

The Patriots filled the practice squad vacancy with defensive back Josh Victorian, who had been released on Wednesday.

Kettani, who stands at 5’11” and weighs 235lbs, was born in Kirtland, Ohio, in 1987 and attended the U.S. Naval Academy.

Military academy players must carry out a five-year commitment following graduation, reported NBC Connecticut.

But they are often given leave to pursue a career in football if they are signed by NFL teams. Kettani was however declined this by the Navy.

‘As our nation is at war, it is important to ensure we maintain our commitment to the nation’s defense,’ a letter from the Navy said.

‘As such, a release from active duty would be inconsistent with that effort.

‘I appreciate your Patriotism and service to our nation and encourage you to pursue your goal to play professional football after completion of your service in the Navy.’
