GCSEs could be replaced by a system of ‘I levels’, with grades numbered from 1 to 8, it has been claimed.

Ofqual – the examinations regulator for England – is also proposing an end to coursework in all core exams except science, while re-sits would be curtailed.

Under the landmark proposals, all end-of-course exams would be sat in the summer – apart from English and maths in November. Pupils would have to wait a full year if they wanted to re-sit them.

Exams regulator Ofqual is proposing an end to course work in all core exams except science

The regulator, which is due to launch a consultation shortly, is said to have decided that a new name was needed for GCSEs because the Welsh Assembly had decided to retain the name for its exams, which will continue to feature modules and course work.

The Times newspaper said that although the title I level – or Intermediate level – does not appear in the consultation paper, it has been discussed by the regulator.

A new grade 8 would replace A* as the highest grade – although fewer would be awarded in order to reflect Education Secretary Michael Gove’s aim of making exams harder while providing greater differentiation between the most able pupils.

Having 8 rather than 1 at the top would leave open the option of introducing a grade 9 if it was felt necessary to make it even more challenging.

The changes – covering English, maths, physics, chemistry, biology, double science, history and geography – would be introduced in schools from 2015, the newspaper said.

Ofqual refused last night to discuss details of the consultation paper, describing the report as ‘speculative’. A spokesman said: ‘We will be consulting shortly.’

According to the newspaper, Ofqual will insist on keeping the A-level brand, because it believes it has international recognition.

Many students currently awarded A*s and As in GCSEs would be expected to achieve grades 7 or 6.

The regulator does not recommend a ‘pass’ grade but the new system implies this would be a grade 4.

The changes are the most radical since the GCSE was introduced in 1986 as a universal qualification, replacing the dual system of O-levels and CSEs aimed at different ability levels

The changes, to be published imminently, apply to new exams in English, maths, physics, chemistry, biology, double science, history and geography, to be introduced in schools from September 2015.

The changes mean hundreds of thousands of teenagers will sit a mixture of new exams and old GCSEs in their early stages.

The biggest change within schools will be to course work, currently performed under exam conditions in classrooms and assessed by teachers, with monitors checking samples of graded work, which accounts for between 25 and 60 per cent of marks for GCSEs.

Critics believe it cuts into valuable teaching time. Course work will be axed entirely for English, maths and history, with a candidate’s speaking and listening skills in English reported separately on their examination certificate.

In geography, Ofqual says fieldwork skills, which are critical to the subject, should be assessed by a written external exam at the end of the course.

Only in science does it propose an element of course work, saying teachers’ assessments of practical laboratory skills should contribute 10 per cent of overall marks.

The changes are the most radical since the GCSE, the General Certificate of Secondary Education, was introduced in 1986 as a universal qualification, replacing the dual system of O-levels and CSEs aimed at different ability levels.

The Department for Education will also publish specifications shortly for the subject content of each of the new qualifications, which exam boards will use to design each syllabus.

For example, the history specification is shorter and much more general than the lengthy list of topics in its draft national curriculum from five to 14, whereas the science required in the new qualifications is set out in much greater detail.
