A 24-year-old cut from his mother's will poisoned and dismembered her before he was caught driving around with her remains according to police.

Ari Liggett, charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday, had a history of threats according to newly released documents in Centennial, Colorado that went so far as placing him on an FBI watch list.

Questioned by police, the former University of Colorado student mentioned his mother’s will and said his ‘definition of right and wrong may be different from what others think,’ according to an affidavit.

Tragic end: The body of Liggett's mother, 56-year-old Beverly Liggett, seen centre after her recent graduation from nursing school, was found in her SUV driven by her son last week

After found driving his mother’s SUV with her remains on October 17, friends of his mother, 56-year-old Beverly Liggett reacted saying the recent nursing school graduate lived in fear of her son after a previous arrest and threat but that she loved him too much to put him away.

'She loved her son very much and went out her way to protect him,' her neighbour Lisa Davis told Our Centennial News. 'So much that she eventually gave her life for
him.'

According to police, Liggett had a history.

Arrested in 2010, Ari was found welding a homemade silencer and mixing dangerous chemical's in his home's backyard that eventually led to the evacuation of a homeless shelter.

Threatening to kill his mother and his sister, his family took him to an unsecured facility and was placed on the FBI's watch list while expressing antisemitism remarks, despite his own Jewish heritage, the Denver Post reports.

Motive: Liggett told police his mother Beverly Liggett, pictured, had recently cut him out of her will

With his latest arrest he told officers his 'definition of right and wrong may differ from what others think, but he knows what society and the law consider to be right and wrong,' according to the affidavit obtained by the Post.

Ms Davis, who said she heard directly of the woman's troubles, said Liggett had been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and Asperger syndrome.

She said the family had tried to find Liggett help but, 'couldn't find a place that would take him.’

'It's just really sad so much more money was spent on police and bomb squad and hazmat,' she said of the spectacle outside the family's home, 'when really it could have been better spent on helping this kid.'

'I saw that Beverly was trapped in this situation,' her boyfriend of five years Seth Masia told 9News. 'The resources didn't exist to extricate her, one way or another it was not going to have a happy ending.'

He said he just never though it would get this out of control.

'It's just tragic, it's just tragic,' Mr Masia said. 'We were planning to grow old together. We were going to have a good life. She deserved a good life.'

Recently having graduated from nursing school with honours, Mr Masia said she worked with handicapped children and loved what she did.

'Her patients loved her,' he said. 'Her employers loved her. She loved her patients.'

Having first met on JDate.com, Mr Masia said 'we were so happy together. She made me laugh. I made her laugh.'

They planned to marry one day.

'She deserves to be remembered with love and admiration and she will be,' he said.

Liggett was arrested two days after he and his mother were reported missing by concerned family members.

Searching the family's home, court documents revealed authorities find of traces of human blood in the freezer and bathtub along with a hand saw and large kitchen knife on the top rack of the dishwasher.

They reported nicks and chips along the edge of the bathtub.

Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson confirmed that the body parts in Liggett's gold Honda CR-V was his mother, a registered nurse.

Family called police to perform a welfare check on the home on Monday evening.

There was no one at home but police were able to verify their whereabouts after tracing credit card transactions.

The car was then apprehended on Wednesday and the 24-year-old was arrested after a police chase which resulted in Liggett crashing the car.

He fled the scene on foot but was captured a short time later, according to the Denver Post.

Liggett, being held in the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office Detention Facility, has his next court appearance scheduled for December 19.

When police searched the home, they found potassium cyanide which is one of the most fast-acting poisons known.

Sheriff Robinson said: 'A preliminary test of that liquid showed a positive for potassium cyanide. It changed our perspective dramatically.

'A detailed missing person's investigation became a complex hazardous material investigation combined with a very complex homicide.'

In 2010, Liggett was arrested and accused of smuggling an unknown substance into a homeless shelter which caused it to be evacuated for seven hours.

The chemical was not able to be identified and he was not charged with a hazardous-material violation.

He was, however, charged with possession of a dangerous weapon after he was found with the silencer a short time later.
