He might be the Prime Minister - but that doesn't mean David Cameron can't do with a little guidance from time to time.

Mr Cameron has revealed that he consults his wife Samantha before taking 'life and death' decisions - including whether to  rescue British hostages.

The Prime Minister said he turned to Mrs Cameron about the matters which keep him awake at night - including 'putting troops potentially in harm's way' - because he valued her opinions.

He said: ‘Samantha is passionate about me continuing what I am doing. The Government has done a good job but it isn’t finished. We have to see it through, that is her strong view.’

He added: ‘She has very good judgment. I talk to Samantha about the most difficult decisions, life and death situations such as rescuing hostages or putting troops potentially in harm’s way.

'You worry a lot. It is a very turbulent night when something like that is going to happen.

‘There is a whole process in Cobra (the emergency committee) and listening to military advice, but in the end I make the decision.’

Mr Cameron made the comments during an exclusive interview with the Mail On Sunday, to mark the launch of his election campaign.  

Praising his wife's organisational skills, he added: ‘If she’d organised Napoleon’s march on Moscow, they would have reached Vladivostok in good time.

'This year she did a lot of the Christmas shopping but I tried to make up for it with some cooking.’ 

Mr Cameron took the decision to send in the SAS to rescue aid worker Helen Johnson in Afghanistan in 2012.

He also agonised in recent years over whether British hostages held by ISIS could be saved.

The Prime Minister has said in the past that he found Mrs Cameron’s advice useful because she took a common sense - rather than political - approach to current affairs.

Last year, the Prime Minister’s wife is said to have pressed him to do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Syria. 

As an ambassador for Save The Children, Mrs Cameron spent time in Lebanon at a refugee camp for those displaced by the civil war.

At the time, the Prime Minister denied that his wife had influenced his thinking.  

The Camerons are due to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary next year. 

Talking about their relationship, he said: ‘We love each other.

'We try not to go to bed on an argument and we spend time together and don’t take it for granted.’ 

In the interview, Mr Cameron also revealed that his new favourite musician to cook to is the folk star Nick Mulvey and that he had also been appointed chief supervisor for their children’s homework.

On the political side, the Prime Minister spoke about his relationship with Washington, revealing that Obama rings and now calls him ‘bro’.
