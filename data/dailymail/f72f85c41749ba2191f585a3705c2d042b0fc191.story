Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last night demanded answers over the case of an NHS whistleblower threatened with the sack after raising concerns about death rates.

The Cabinet minister intervened after the Mail revealed Sandra Haynes Kirkbright could be fired for raising fears that a hospital was fiddling its death figures.

Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, a 'health coder', was suspended after accusing Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust of manipulating records and hiring her in the belief she would do the same.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has intervened over the case of an NHS whistleblower threatened with the sack after raising concerns about death rates

The 50-year-old received a letter from hospital bosses last week saying she had breached her contract by talking to the Press, and warning that she faced a hearing which 'may result in formal disciplinary action, not excluding dismissal'.

The threat was made despite repeated assurances from the Government and NHS bosses that whistleblowers will be protected.

Last night Mr Hunt met urgently with hospital watchdogs to demand an investigation into the case.

Bosses at Wolverhampton were later instructed to postpone any planned action against Mrs Haynes Kirkbright.

In a letter to Mr Hunt last night, David Flory, chief executive of the NHS Trust Development Authority, wrote: 'I have today written to the chief executive of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, David Laughton, asking him to clarify what action the Trust has taken to address the whistleblowing allegations and to assure us that any further action they plan does not impede Mrs Haynes Kirkbright's rights as a whistleblower.

'A disciplinary hearing for Mrs Haynes Kirkbright is due to take place in two weeks' time. I have today instructed the Trust to postpone this hearing.'

Mr Flory also said that bosses at Wolverhampton could face being disciplined themselves.

'Any allegation of wrongdoing, if proven, would result in formal action being taken,' he added.

Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was hired by Royal Wolverhampton in October 2011. She had previously worked at Stafford Hospital and overseen an improvement in coding â€“ an administrative role of recording how patients have been treated.

Bosses offered to almost double her salary to Â£54,000 a year. She now believes this is because they thought she had performed some kind of 'trick' in making death figures at the scandal-hit hospital look better than they really were.

Royal Wolverhampton had scored one of the highest mortality rates in the country, with concerns raised over high deaths at weekends.

Mrs Haynes Kirkbright said the hospital was as bad or worse than Stafford, where as many as 1,200 patients died needlessly.

Immediately after starting her new job, Mrs Haynes Kirkbright raised concerns with her bosses that its coders were 'breaking every rule in the book'. Bosses reacted angrily to her claims, with one instructing her not to put them in writing because 'the Press can get hold of it through Freedom of Information'.

Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was suspended for alleged bullying and harassment nine months after starting work for Wolverhampton.

She denies the claims and, believing they had been made up to silence her, she spoke to the Mail in March last year.

Last night, Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, who is originally from Texas, said she was delighted her case was being examined by watchdogs.

'I feel relieved,' she added. 'It is extremely encouraging that Jeremy Hunt is standing by what he has said about protecting whistleblowers.'
