At least two people were killed and eight injured during a shooting at pub in Sweden last night.

Automatic weapons are believed to have been used in the attack yesterday during the screening of a football match in Biskopsgarden, a suburb of Gothenburg with a history of gang violence.

Detectives said it was too early to speculate on the motive behind the shooting - which happened at about 10.20pm local time (9.20pm GMT) - but there were indications that it was gang-related.

Two dead and eight injured: The shooting took place inside a pub called ‘Var Krog och Bar’ (Our Tavern and Bar) in Biskopsgarden, a suburb of Gothenburg in Sweden, at about 10.20pm local time yesterday

Police spokesman Ulla Brehm said that at least two people were killed at the scene and several others taken to a hospital, adding: ‘There is absolutely nothing that indicates terrorism.’

One witness, who did not wish to be named, told Swedish broadcaster SVT that two men entered the pub and started shooting with automatic weapons.

He said: ‘I didn't have a chance to think about what happened. Then I saw that my friend was bleeding. I tried to stop the bleeding as well as I could with my hand.’

Several people are now being questioned by police. Ms Brehm said the area on Hisingen, an island off Gothenburg, had seen a lot of gang violence and that was a likely explanation for the shooting.

She added: ‘We have had a targeted police operation in this area because we have gang crime here. There have been shootings in the past.’

The attack took place inside a restaurant called ‘Var Krog och Bar’ (Our Tavern and Bar). It opened in 1995 and also has a sports bar and a nightclub open on Fridays and Saturdays.

Gothenburg (known as 'Goteborg' in Swedish) is located in south-western Sweden and is the country's second biggest city. Police said the death toll from the attack was likely to rise.

Ten ambulances were sent to the scene, and the injured are being treated at Sahlgrenska University Hospital - but a spokesman said last night: ‘We cannot say anything.’

Gun violence is not uncommon in Sweden's major cities, but shootings in public places with multiple victims are rare.

On January 30 a man was wounded in a shooting on the square outside the restaurant, although it was not clear last night whether the shootings were linked.
