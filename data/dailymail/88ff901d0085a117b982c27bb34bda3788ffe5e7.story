The mastermind behind a plot to smuggle over £200 million worth of cocaine has been jailed for almost 20 years.

Stephen Brown, 46, organised a project to take the Class A drugs to Ireland over from the Caribbean in July 2007.

Brown, of no fixed address, admitted two counts of conspiracy to supply a controlled drug to another country.

Brown's 'mastermind' operation took a turn for the worse after his crew overloaded their inflatable boat when the drugs were being transferred from a catamaran at sea.

The boat struggled to maintain balance in the nine feet waves as Brown's gang tried to land the cargo in the remote Dunlough Bay off Mizen Head in southwest Cork, July 2007.

The boat eventually sank leaving 62 bales of high-quality cocaine floating in the water.

Brown was jailed today after being extradited from Spain earlier this year, where he had been serving a six and half year sentence for drug smuggling.

Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said: ‘This was a large criminal enterprise which potentially had significant rewards if it had proceeded as planned.

‘Just over 1500kg of cocaine at a high purity, with a street value of over £200 million came from the Caribbean, destined for the Republic of Ireland.

‘But they ended up in the sea before they could be brought here.

‘The Court of Appeal has described this case as one of the utmost gravity.

'You were an organiser of this project, influencing others, and were in charge of sourcing the drugs and must have been expecting a significant financial gain.’

Two years ago, former Scotland Yard drug squad officer Michael Daly, 51, was jailed for 22 years along with Alan John Wells, 58, for 14 years.

Daly’s brother Joe was also sentenced to 25 years over the smuggling plot, as well as Martin Wanden, 47, and convicted killer Perry Wharrie, 52, who were both handed 30-year sentences after a trial in Cork, Ireland.

Wharrie had previously served 17 years for shooting Pc Frank Mason in the back as he tried to stop a bank robbery in Hemel Hempstead, Herts, in 1988, and was released from his life term in 2005.

Gerard Hagan, was handed a reduced 10-year jail term after alerting the coast guards to the sinking boat, which saved Wanden’s life in a dramatic helicopter rescue.

Police suspect that as many as 10 people could have travelled from Britain to west Cork to take part in the pick-up.

Daly was already serving eight years for masterminding an almost identical operation after smuggling £4million worth of cocaine on to a remote beach in Kent.

Other alleged gang members yet to be caught include 49-year-old Robert Ferguson - dubbed ‘The Ferrari Fugitive’ - who is thought to be in hiding in the Spanish Costas.

Another alleged plotter Lee Dryden, 48, has recently been arrested in Portugal and is set to be extradited to the UK.

Brown was sentenced to 19 years and 360 days exactly -  taking into account the five days he spent in custody in Spain awaiting transfer back to the UK.
