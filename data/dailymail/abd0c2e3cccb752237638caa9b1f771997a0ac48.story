Paul Merson launched a scathing attack on Arsenal after they threw away a three goal lead to draw 3-3 with Anderlecht in the Champions League.

Speaking on Sky Sports after the match, the former Gunners midfielder slammed the team's overly-offensive tactics as Arsene Wenger's side squandered a three-goal lead.

On eleven separate occasions he slammed the current side as 'tactically clueless' and berated the mental weakness of the Gunners players.

Here, Sportsmail's Rob Draper analyses where it's going wrong for Arsenal.

THE CONUNDRUM

He can do it. Check the date and note the venue: 21st May, 2005, The Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. Arsene Wenger spent the years running up to that FA Cup final saying that he would never abandon his attacking instincts and his beloved 4-4-2 system.

And yet that day in Cardiff he did. So confused were observers that it took time to work out Arsenal’s formation: yes, he really was playing 4-5-1 with Dennis Bergkamp as a lone striker – and even he was dropping deep to help out.

That day Arsenal had Philippe Senderos at centre back facing a United attack of Wayne Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy with Cristiano Ronaldo on the wing and Paul Scholes and Roy Keane in midfield. And yet they did it; with Thierry Henry injured and with a much weaker team than Manchester United, they eked out their draw and won on penalties.

Likewise, a year later in 2006 in the Champions League final against Barcelona: down to ten men after the sending off of Jens Lehmann, Arsenal defended manfully for 76 minutes, holding on to a 1-0 lead and only succumbing in that final quarter of an hour. So if Wenger could do it then, why can’t Arsenal do it now? And, against Anderlecht, of all teams; not exactly Manchester United or Barcelona.

THE CENTRAL PROBLEM? IT'S THE MIDFIELD, STUPID...

The back four have naturally been the focus of the capitulation on Tuesday night and rightly so in one respect. But while it is true that Arsenal’s defence had an awful night against Anderlecht, the warning signs had been clear in the opening twenty minutes when Dennis Praet had acres of space in which to operate in front of the defence. There is rarely any protection given to Arsenal defenders. Maybe Wenger believes that is the way the modern game has evolved but few seem to share his belief; and it is not what he once believed.

When he was consistently winning trophies, Arsenal were a more pragmatic team than they have been in the last nine years, when one trophy has been gleaned. Now it is all about accumulating dainty, skilful midfield player, who are glorious to watch; back in 1996, among his first recruits for the club were Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, strong midfielders, with height and power. After Petit, there was Gilberto Silva, And that Cup final in 2005 was Vieira’s last game, after which the trophies dried up.

Those midfielders could get forward and contribute to attack but they had a basic defensive mind-set and a protective instinct; neither Mikel Arteta, nor Aaron Ramsey nor Jack Wilshere has that; Mathieu Flamini does, but with neither the athleticism nor the technical ability of his predecessors.

THE DEFENCE? THERE IS NO DEFENCE, BUT...

That said, the back four is clearly weak and insufficient for the task of winning a Premier League title or the Champions League, which brings us back to a familiar refrain at Arsenal about the lack of recruitment. 

Wenger himself predicted before the season began that Per Mertesacker would experience a dip in form after winning the World Cup, as Vieira and Petit did in 1998. So why, when Thomas Vermaelen was sold, was there no replacement signed? 

Calum Chambers may well be a centre half in the future, but at 19 years old, clearly wasn’t ready to be a regular in that position. He is raw and potential to be excellent but is often exposed in his more natural position at right back, Likewise, Nacho Monreal doesn’t always convince at left back, so being asked to play centre half is a big ask.

Wenger’s retort would be that it is tough to recruit a third-choice centre half: a world class defender won’t accept that and anything else would be sub-standard. But that is rather like fisherman complaining about the sea. It’s just part of the job. Entering a season with two recognised senior centre halves was clearly a risk too far; it doesn’t need the clarity of hindsight to say so; plenty said it in August.

THE PHILOSOPHY 

The 2005 FA Cup final should be Arsene Wenger’s reference point. It isn’t of course but it should be. Wenger is coy his footballing inspirations but from outside it always seems as though Johan Cruyff’s attack-minded football is his blueprint, though there has always been a healthy regard for Arrigo Sacchi’s AC Milan, which is why 4-4-2 was once his mantra.

Clearly he will always be an attacking coach and we should applaud him for that. But so wide are the gaps in Arsenal’s midfield at times - successive games at Stamford Bridge over the past ten years come to mind, last season’s 6-0 simply being the worst – it seems been blinded by his own beliefs, like a political leader wedded to an misguided ideology. 

The more Wenger’s teams struggle, the more determined he is to win something without physical defensive players, as if to prove a point. But that wasn’t how he established his name as a manger, not at Arsenal, nor at Monaco, where midfielders Marcel Dib and Jean Philippe Rohr were his engine room.

Perhaps there is hope. Arsenal are in the market for a strong, mobile athletic defensive midfielder. In fact it is their No.1 priority, more so than a centre half. William Carvalho at Sporting looks to be the prototype - he defends and he is huge - but Arsenal don’t believe he is mobile enough so is unlikely to be the answer. Anyway his links to Jorge Mendes, Jose Mourinho’s agent, means Arsenal would struggle to sign him. It is noticeable that Mendes players hardly ever go to Arsenal.

What is clear is that he is the type of players that is required. If Wenger cannot rediscover his roots, the Anderlecht debacle – which can be added to the calamities at Anfield and Stamford Bridge from last season – will repeat. But if he could remodel a side based on axis like Vieira and Petit, imagine what his team could achieve?
