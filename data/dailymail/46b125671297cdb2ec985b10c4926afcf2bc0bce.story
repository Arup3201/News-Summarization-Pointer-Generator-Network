A barber has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a wet shave customer was rushed to hospital with a four-inch gash to his neck.

Daniel Flores, 22, was working at Vic's Barbershop Monday in Imperial Beach, California, when he slashed several times at the throat of 33-year-old Timothy Paul Vaughn then ran out, leaving Vaughn badly bleeding. 

Vaughn, who was left with a large wound on his neck in the incident, was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center in a critical condition but is expected to survive.

It's still unclear what led to the near-fatal shave Monday afternoon at Vic's Barbershop. 

Witnesses say Flores and Vaughn did not argue before the shave. 

The barber allegedly cut the customer's neck more than once before running away from the shop, leaving Vaughn bleeding out on the floor.

When police showed up at the scene, the owner of the shop called Flores' aunt who came to the scene. 

While she was talking with officers, her nephew called from her house and he was soon after arrested a block from that home.

Flores was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder.
