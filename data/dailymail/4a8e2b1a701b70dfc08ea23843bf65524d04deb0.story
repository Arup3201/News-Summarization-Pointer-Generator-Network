A major water company has to spend £7 million every year clearing sewers which have been blocked by foreign objects accidentally flushed down the toilet. 

Among the detritus recovered from Anglian Water's sewers are toys, mobile phones and even some false teeth. 

Such is the extent of the problem, that workers are removing on average one tonne of waste a day. 

Much of the rubbish, such as disposable wipes, needs to be removed by hand and then compacted.  

Emma Staple, spokeswoman for Anglian Water Services, said: “All that should go down is poo, pee and paper.

'The main problem by a long stretch is disposable wipes which people put down the toilet instead of in the bin. It costs around £7 million to clear all these things out of the sewage network.

'That does reflect in customers’ bills and it’s money that would be better spent elsewhere.'

Dentists advise that the owners of false teeth should ensure they are cleaned regularly, but not in the bowl of the toilet where they may escape

Also, very few people are that desperate to talk that they want to listen to the other person while they are ensconced on the throne 

While it is true that certain public toilets require a small coin to proceed, users should be careful with where they leave their flexible friend

When applying Vaseline, it is best practice to move away from the toilet bowl in case the lubricant qualities of the product cause it to slip 

While it might say 'Eau de Toilette' on the bottle, you should not attempt to refill the container from the bowl as it is not the same liquid

Toilet duck may be a popular brand of cleaning product but this frog was rescued from one of Anglian Water's sewers by an engineer

Toy animals should not be flushed down the toilet under any circumstances as it is incredibly cruel and uncaring  

Not even superheroes are safe from taking the porcelain plunge into the nation's sewerage system, blocking up the pipes

Among the items regularly recovered from the nation's sewers are golf balls and wallets, which is an interesting combination 

Despite the decline in popularity of hair curlers since the 1950s they should be only disposed in an environmentally sustainable manner
