T-shirts bearing an ironic slogan from the notorious 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite are being sold online in the run-up to Christmas.

The t-shirts, currently available to buy on Amazon, are emblazoned with a quote from the terror suspect which references her former husband's involvement in the July 7 London bombings.

Lewthwaite is one of the world's most wanted women and was widowed after her husband Germaine Lindsay's 2005 suicide bombing of the London underground - part of a wider plot which killed 52 people.

The t-shirt (pictured) features a statement by Lewthwaite in which she condemned her husband's role in the 2005 London attacks. She has since gone on to become the world's most wanted female terrorist

The t-shirts state: 'Jamal is accountable for his actions 100 (per cent) and I condemn with all my heart what he has done. Samantha Lewthwaite.'

The quote is taken from an interview she gave to the press following revelations of her husband's involvement in the attacks, The Telegraph reported. It refers to him by his second name, Jamal.

The manufacturer's listing states the 'amazing quote t-shirt will not go out of style', adding they make tops that are 'ageless' and are in 'admiration of incredible novelists, playwrights, creative thinkers, and philosophers that are icons to our generation.

'These popular writer tees convey the essence of self-assurance, knowledge, thought, inspiration, wisdom, love, the meaning of life, the universe and all sorts of things.'

Despite her public condemnation of his actions, she is now considered to be the world's most dangerous female terrorist, with links to Al-Shabaab in Somalia.

The  30-year-old, from Buckinghamshire, is believed to be 'alive and well' and living in southern Somalia with a jihadist husband, a wanted al-Qaeda suspect who calls himself Marco Costa.

In a forged Mozambican passport obtained by MailOnline, his picture clearly identifies him as Fahmi Jamal Salim, who has been on the run from Kenyan police since he shot and killed two police officers in Nairobi in 2011.

Lewthwaite and Salim also appear in a 'selfie' taken at their home. Police are using these and pictures of their two children in a countrywide manhunt for the couple.

Counter-terrorism sources in Kenya revealed their updated profile of Lewthwaite last month in response to claims from a Moscow news agency last month that she had been killed by sniper fire while fighting with a Ukrainian volunteer battalion against pro-Russian rebels.

Kenyan intelligence authorities are demanding to see Lewthwaite's body and say they refuse to believe she has been part of any militia outside East Africa.

By marrying Salim, Lewthwaite has joined a family steeped in Muslim extremism and the jihad.

Salim's brother-in-law was notorious al-Qaeda recruiting officer Musa Dheere, shot dead at a roadblock in Mogadishu in 2011 alongside Fazul Mohamed, a terror suspect with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head.

Dheere was wanted for the bombing of American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam in 1998 when several hundred were killed.

Lewthwaite slipped through a British police net through a series of blunders after her former husband's involvement in the London bomb plot.

Lewthwaite claimed to have known nothing of his extremist activities but she next surfaced in 2011 in a Muslim ghetto area of Mombasa where she was assembling bomb-making equipment with other Al-Shabaab suspects.

Several were arrested and are currently standing trial while Lewthwaite fooled local counter-terrorism police with a false South African passport for herself and her two young children by Lindsay.
