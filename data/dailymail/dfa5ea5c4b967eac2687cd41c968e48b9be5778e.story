Three French jihadis urge their fellow countrymen to kill the enemies of Allah, 'spit in their faces and run over them with your cars', in the latest propaganda video from ISIS militants.

In the seven-minute long video, the men symbolically burn their French passports. They appear bearded and without masks, clutching assault rifles and long-bladed knives.

Addressing the camera in French, one of the jihadis exhorts French Muslims to fight unbelievers at home in France if they are unable to travel to Iraq or Syria, saying they have 'cars and weapons available'. The video says it is also possible to kill using poison in either water or food.

Three French jihadis burned their passports in the latest ISIS propaganda video released on the internet

The first unmasked terrorist, described as Abu Osama al-Faranci, addressed the camera holding a rifle

His comrade Abu Maryam al-Faranci, warned the people of France he would cut off their heads 

The video, which has high production values, is subtitled in both Arabic and English.  

The burning of a passport is a common ritual ceremony practiced by new foreign fighters who have left their homelands and travelled to fight for ISIS. It is seen as a sign of loyalty to the group and a renouncement of their nationality and old identity.

Thousands of foreigners are believed to have travelled Iraq and Syria to join ISIS, the militant group also known as Islamic State that has captured a huge area along the borders of the two nations and is imposing brutal rule.

Military forces fighting the militants are being supported by bombing raids by British, US, French and other countries forces. ISIS regularly issues chilling videos showing beheadings of captured prisoners, foreign aid workers and journalists and other atrocities. The videos condemn governments and urge Muslims to follow their extreme version of the religion.

The latest video opens with a masked fighter speaking in fluent French, praising the Muslims who have travelled to Syria and Iraq and denounced the Western ideas of democracy and nationalism.

The camera shows a small group of ISIS fighters standing in a circle around a fire. They smile as they throw their passports into the fire.

Some of the men take their time to slowly place their passport in the fire, while others simply throw their identity documents into the flames. Only four don’t have their faces covered with a scarf.

The French speaking masked fighter declares: 'You have oppressed us, fought our religion and insulted our Prophet (peace be upon him.) And today, we disbelieve in you and your passports, and if you come here we will fight you.'

He urged French Muslims to poison the water and food 'of at least one of the enemies of Allah' 

The group are then shown sitting down, with the three unmasked French men positioned in the middle.

The three French men take it in turns to urge Muslims in France to travel to Syria and Iraq and fight for ISIS.

According the video, which was released by the ISIS propaganda unit Al Hayat Media Center, the men are called Abu Osama al-Faranci, Abu Maryam al-Faranci and Abu Salman al-Faranci.

Abu Osama al-Firanci declares that jihad is 'the path of Allah' and questions why all French Muslims haven’t joined ISIS.

'What are you waiting for?' he says. 'Why do you not perform Hijra? How do you accept to work in the land of Kufr (disbelievers) when Allah has opened a door for you to perform the best of deeds.'

He continues to berate French Muslims for paying taxes and strengthening the economy, insisting the French government use the money to 'fight us, and kill our sisters, our women and our children'.

He urges Muslims to leave France, warning that 'a day may come when the borders will be closed and you will be left only with tears and regret'.

He goes on to praise the French nationals who have travelled to Syria, particularly the pregnant women who have made the dangerous journey. He added: 'The road is easy so there are no excuses for you.'

He even claimed they should 'kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars'

He warned that ISIS had weapons and cars available in France along with potential targets 'ready to be hit'

Another French speaker, Abu Maryam al-Faranci, holding a large sword and an AK-47 assault rifle, boasts that ISIS fighters 'will not hesitate to cut your heads' if the French government keeps bombing Iraq and Syria. He warns that French civilians 'will even fear travelling to the market'.

Abu Maryam calls on French Muslims to wage jihad. He refers to the banning of the niqab in France, declaring 'What are you waiting for? Do you not look around you?'

He claims the Islamic State is 'ruled by the Shariah of Allah and gives every Muslim his due rights.'

The final French fighter, referred to as Abu Salman al-Faransi, urged any French Muslim who cannot travel to Syria to wage jihad at home.

Abu Salman says Muslims in France should target civilians on the streets and to use any means possible to cause maximum suffering.

'Terrorise them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror. There are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit. Even poison is available, so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of Allah,' he says.

He said: 'Kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars. Do whatever you are able to do in order to humiliate them, for they deserve only this.' 

He ends the video by ordering women and children to come and live under Islamic State, vowing there will be 'generations who will fight you O crusaders.'

One of the fighters in the video is seen brandishing a US-made AR-15 assault rifle. 

The video comes just days after a two French nationals were shown on video taking part in a mass systematic execution of 18 Syrian air force soldiers at an unknown site believed to be in the swathe of territory in northern Iraq and Syria captured by ISIS militants.
