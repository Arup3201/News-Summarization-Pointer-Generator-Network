Family matters to Stephen Gallacher. From uncle Bernard, a sporting role model if ever there was, to his parents and his own wife and kids, the boy from Bathgate is surrounded by people who love and support him.

When he makes his Ryder Cup bow at Gleneagles next week, then, he’ll be thinking of the entire clan. Among them grandmother Millie, who passed away within days of Gallacher being named as one of Team Europe captain’s wildcard selections.

‘She knew I was in the team and was proud of me,’ he said: ‘Now I’ll do her proud. It puts things into perspective. Family are more important than anything and things like that happening certainly keep you grounded.

‘I went from the highest of the highs to the lowest of the lows in a day. I’d just got into the team when I heard my gran, who had gone in for a routine operation, was getting kept in - then ultimately passed away on the Sunday.

‘But Bernard was up and the family were all at her bedside. It was a tough time, no doubt, but that’s life.’

Gallacher is away from home this week, playing in the ISPS Handa Wales Open as a warm-up to the main event on a track he knows better than just about anyone on the European Tour; seven top-10 finishes on the PGA Centenary Course suggest a certain affinity with a venue he’s been visiting since he was a nipper.

Still, practice rounds there last week came as something as a shock – illustrating to Gallacher just how enormous next week will be.

How will the rookie, nephew of former Ryder Cup player and captain Bernard, cope with it all? Firstly, by talking to those who have been through it all before.

‘We are meeting Paul McGinley tonight then I will go for dinner with Paul Lawrie tomorrow night,’ said Gallacher, who tees off in the Wales Open on Thursday.

‘We also have a mega-experienced backroom staff, while I’ve spoken to my uncle a couple of times as well - and they are all saying pretty much the same thing. They’ve said that I should go and enjoy it.

‘As for the first tee in a Ryder Cup, you can’t replicate that anywhere. Can it be any more nervous than holing a putt for a birdie or eagle to win a tournament or get into a play-off?

‘Nervousness or excitement is only really how much pressure you put on yourself. I don’t get up and down much but I feel both nervous and excited, excited more than anything, when I play normal events.

‘The reaction to me getting in the team has been more than I expected, to be honest. I don’t know if it’s down to me being the only Scot in the team or that it’s more than 40 years since a Ryder Cup was played here. It’s a bigger animal now. It’s huge.

‘I also live down the road from Gleneagles and there’s a family connection, too, with the Ryder Cup. Me and my wife still have a laugh when we see my face on billboards or trolleys at the airport. It’s a bit surreal but it’s something I’ve got to get used to and embrace.

‘I’m happy to be back at work this week, though. It’s starting to get a bit manic back up the road with it coming up so soon.

‘When you go up to the course now, as I did last week, you see the enormity of the tournament and the enormity of everything behind the scenes, the stands and the hospitality. You realise how big a deal it is.

‘The course is ultimately the same. It’s just how much the infrastructure has changed and the practice area is all merchandise, and all the way down the first 18 is all hospitality. It’s going to be fantastic for the public for viewing. It’s a great stadium course and it’s in fantastic condition.

‘Knowing the course can only help me. I’ve had seven top 10s round there and hit a lot of good shots over the years. When you are standing on tees or walking between shots you are definitely thinking positively.’
