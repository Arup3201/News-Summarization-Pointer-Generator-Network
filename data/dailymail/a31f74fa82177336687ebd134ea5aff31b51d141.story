The Islamist fanatic who held at least a dozen people hostage in Sydney planned to send hundreds of abusive letters to the families of British soldiers who died in Afghanistan, it has emerged.

Man Haron Monis said he wanted to send a 'very nice condolence letter' and '237 baskets of flowers' to British families who lost loved ones in the war since 2001.

But he was blocked from carrying out his plan by a Sydney court in 2010 after sending 'grossly offensive' letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan.

Monis was sentenced to 300 hours community service in September last year for the letters he sent to the families of seven Australian soldiers killed between 2007 and 2009.

In the letters, Monis likened soldiers to murderers and killers, and in one letter said the man was going to hell.

Ini 2010 Monis wrote on his blog that he had sent the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown a letter informing him 'that I would like to send 237 baskets of flowers attached with 237 condolence letters to the families of the British soldiers who have been killed in Afghanistan since October 2001'.

He claims Mr Brown 'on 7th January 2010 has thanked me for that'.

But at a hearing in August 2013, he failed to overturn the order banning him from using the postal service to contact the families of military personnel.

Speaking after the hearing, he said that meant he would not be allowed to send his 'very nice condolence letter' and '237 baskets of flowers' to the families of British soldiers who have been killed in Afghanistan since October 2001.

'Why not? Why shouldn't we offer our condolences?' he asked. 'There is nothing wrong in the letters I have sent.'

He complained it was against his human right and 'if my family are the victims of a terrorist attack, I will not be able to contact them', the Telegraph revealed today.

'My relatives and family are an exception but if any friend in any terrorist attack (is) wounded or killed, first I should ask permission from the Australian Defence Force, then I can contact my friends to offer my condolences.'

Monis said the letters were meant to offer comfort and were different to the ones he had sent to Australian soldiers' families.

He claimed an example would have been: 'I write to you to offer my condolences for the loss of a member of your family.

'I am so sorry that you have gone through a very hard time and I ask God to give you patience for that sad incident.

'I advise first myself and then you to believe in God deeply and by praying to God try to stay calm and strong during the difficult times.

'I hope one day, all nations including British and Afghani nations enjoy peace.'
