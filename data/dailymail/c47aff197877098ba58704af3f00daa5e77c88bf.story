Apple is preparing to launch a smaller version of the multi-million selling iPad, it was claimed yesterday.

The little brother of the tablet device would measure fewer than eight inches across the diagonal – considerably smaller than the current 9.7-inch model – and be cheaper.

It was also suggested what has been dubbed the 'iPad Mini' could be available in the autumn – in time for Christmas.

The competition: Apple's latest iPad on offers a fantastic experience in the hand - put a painful one in the pocket

'Mid-sized' tablets such as Samsung's Galaxy Note have been big sellers - and have begun to eat into Apple's dominance of the tablet market

Apple is notoriously secretive about 
its technical innovations and rumours of the smaller tablet are said to 
have originated from the Far East, where many of the company's devices 
are manufactured.

They were reported by Bloomberg and 
the Wall Street Journal, which quoted  several unnamed sources within 
Apple's supply chain. A UK spokesman last night said: 'Apple does not 
comment on rumour or speculation.'

The current iPad costs upwards of 
£399 and industry insiders said an 'iPad Mini' would be an obvious 
response to competition from rival tablets such as Google's seven-inch 
£159 Nexus 7.

Far Eastern technology blogs also 
hinted that a launch by Apple was imminent. Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu 
predicts that the move would be a devastating blow for Android 
competitors. 'It would be the competitors' worst nightmare,' he said.

The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs,
 who died last October, was vehemently against a smaller iPad, saying in
 2010: 'The reason we won't make a seven-inch tablet isn't because we 
don't want to hit a lower price point, it's because we think the screen 
is too small to express the software.'

The iPad Mini would show that Apple is prepared to break away from former chief exec 
Steve Jobs' deeply-held mantras.

The Nexus packs a high-definition 
screen, the latest 'quad-core' processor, runs the latest version of 
Android, and has a battery life which can handle nine hours of 
continuous video playback.

The firm hopes the tablet will take on 
Apple’s iPad.

It's part of a new generation of iPad rivals, including Microsoft’s Surface tablet which was revealed 
last week, and current Android tablets including Amazon’s Fire.

Two versions will be available, one with
 8GB of storage for $199 and a second with 16GB for $249. By comparison,
 Apple's new iPad, which has a larger 9.7 inch screen, costs $399 for a 
16GB version.

The Windows version of a tablet: The new Surface was unveiled by Microsoft last week

Amazon's Kindle Fire is likely to be hit hard by Apple's new launch - the cheap tablet is also seven inches, but built on unglamorous hardware

Earlier this year, a Samsung official appeared to confirm the existence of a smaller 'iPad Mini', due to be released this year.

The official said to a Korean newspaper, 'The amount of the current contract [between Apple and Samsung] is around $9.7billion.

'The contract is expected to rise to $11billion by the end of this 
year as Apple is planning to release a smaller iPad, probably with a 
7.85-inch screen, and to sell more of its MacBook Air PCs using 
Samsung’s faster solid state drive (SSD) storage.'

Microsoft also recently unveiled its own 'Surface' tablet, a touchscreen running its new Windows 8 software.

Apple's new tablet will also be a concern to Amazon, as their Android-running tablets, such as the Kindle Fire, have 
been runaway successes in the U.S.

Kindle
 Fire is also a seven-inch tablet, built around the old BlackBerry 
PlayBook, but running a customised version of Android focused on selling
 videos, apps and music via Amazon's Marketplace.

Microsoft has previously tried and failed at bringing Windows tablets to the market.

Bill Gates spent the tail-end of the 
1990s trying to convince people that tablets were the wave of the future
 - but Microsoft never quite got either the hardware or software working
 together, and their early efforts - as long ago as 2001 - never 
convinced anyone.

The runaway success of 'mid-sized' devices such as Samsung's Galaxy Note, which has a five-inch screen, has helped Samsung gain ground in the tablet market

On the other hand, the risk to Apple 
is that a different-sized tablet might lead to fragmentation - where 
apps and games need re-configuring by their developers to ensure they 
are compatible on both versions.

This has been Android's biggest issue in the last few years.

Different screen sizes, different 
manufacturers, different versions of the operating system and different
 price-points all lead to choice for the consumer - but at the cost of 
development headaches and an inconsistent experience.
