Floyd Mayweather has never been reluctant to show off the array of fast cars his boxing success has enabled him to buy.

He has posed alongside his own Lamorghini, his Bugatti and his Porsche 911 in previous posts on Instagram. 

And after not posting a picture of one of the cars he owns since January 8th, Mayweather decided it was time to treat his 4.5 million followers to a picture of him with his Ferrari Enzo.

Floyd Mayweather uploaded the above image to his Instagram account of his Ferrari Enzo

Mayweather was photographed enjoying the NBA game between Los Angeles Clippers and Brooklyn Nets

Mayweather posted a picture of him leaning against a Bentley Flying Spur in 2013 

Mayweather's last snap of his cars was to show his three Bugattis, including two Veyrons, and his private jet

Here a few facts about why the value of the Ferrari Enzo will only 'appreciate', as Mayweather wrote:

How many exist: 399

Cost: $1million, or £677,000

Top speed: 218 mph

Horsepower: 650

0-60: 3.7 seconds 

'The value of my Ferrari Enzo only appreciates. Do your research,' wrote Mayweather next to the picture. 

The car is named after Enzo Ferrari, the founder of the world famous car company.

Mayweather was photographed on Thursday watching the NBA match between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Brooklyn Nets.

The Clippers emerged resounding winners with a scoreline of 123-84 and Mayweather will undoubtedly be confident of being equally as emphatic should he end up taking on Manny Pacquiao in the ring.
