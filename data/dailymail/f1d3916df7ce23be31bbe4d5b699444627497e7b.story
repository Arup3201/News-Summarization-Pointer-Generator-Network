Forecasters warned today that extreme
cold will grip the country over the next few day with the possibility of
snow even in London and the south.

The Met Office has maintained its cold weather alert at level three, which means 'severe' conditions.

Some areas have been told to expect temperatures of minus -11C and the Army 
has been put on standby should conditions get even worse.

Around
four inches of snow and ice are forecast for parts of the country due to a 
high-pressure system over Scandinavia which is pushing raw eastern winds towards the UK.

Record low temperatures in Eastern Europe have caused dozens of fatalities with 43 dead in 
Ukraine alone, where the mercury dropped to -33C.

Paul Mott, forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'The nights will be 
really cold throughout the week and there will be the occasional snow 
showers over the eastern counties of England, eastern Scotland and even 
London.'

Mr Mott said the mercury could plummet 
to as low as -10C in rural parts of central England on Thursday night, 
with average day time readings only reaching 3C-4C.

BBC Radio 5 Live said temperatures could fall as low as -11C.

MeteoGroup forecaster Clare
Allen said: 'We've got an easterly wind bringing snow showers off the North Sea. Most areas 
of the UK will see daytime maximum temperatures of 2C and 3C. 
London will be a maximum of 4C, so it's going to be pretty 
cold.'

Devon and Cornwall have already felt 
the brunt of the bad weather. Police in the two counties have warned 
motorists not to travel 
unless it is essential after snowfalls on Exmoor 
and Dartmoor.

The icy blast meant staff at Luton Airport had to defrost a fleet of easyJet planes yesterday before passengers could get 
on, as temperatures dipped below freezing at the airport in 
Bedfordshire.

It warned that low temperatures can be especially dangerous for the young and the elderly or those with chronic disease.

Health chiefs have also started 
warning that as a result of the freezing conditions, more than 1,500 
people a week could be killed by the weather.

The Department of Health's Chief Medical
Officer said that around 1,560 people, many elderly, would die due to 
cold weather each week between now and March in normal winter weather. 
That figure will rise 'substantially', however, due to extreme cold like
that we are currently experiencing.

During last year's big freeze, the death rate in England and Wales shot up by 21 per cent from 9,220 a week to 11,193.

Dame Sally Davies said: 'Mortality 
rises by 19 per cent in winter months in England, amounting to 27,000 
excess deaths or 1,560 more people per week compared with the rest of 
the year. And very severe weather can substantially add to this death 
toll.

'The majority of UK deaths are among 
older people, especially women, and those with underlying health 
problems - but they are not people who would have died anyhow at that 
time.'

The military have been put on alert should conditions deteriorate to a Met Office level 4, which means a 'major cold weather incident'.

When
freezing conditions struck in 2010, members of the armed forces were 
called in to help clear snow from the roads and assist residents in 
particularly hard-hit areas.

Mobilised soldiers will also help clear 
special locations such as doctors’ surgeries, care homes and hospitals.

The cold spell breaks what has so far been one of the warmest winters on record. Forecasters said it was becoming 
increasingly likely that the freezing temperatures would stick around 
and even last through the whole of February.

There are fears that the sudden onset could bring travel chaos and catch many drivers off guard.

AA
spokesman Luke Bodett said: ‘We have had a very mild winter so far and 
motorists need to get into their winter mindset from today. It is going 
to be important not to charge around in the way they may have been used 
to and be prepared for the unexpected.’

The Met Office has briefed government 
departments and local councils about the cold period so that extreme 
weather plans can be put on standby.

Meanwhile, well-prepared residents in a Cornish village have 
bought their own snowplough and gritter after they were cut off for a 
week in a blizzard during previous winters.

The Badgall and Laneast Action
Group (Blag), have raised £2,650 to buy the plough and mechanical salt 
spreader. Two farmers in the area have been designated to operate them 
during heavy snowfall. Blag said residents 'voted with their pockets' 
after being cut off during the last two winters.

Britain has seen very little wintry weather so far this season – but nothing is ever straightforward with our weather.

After three consecutive harsh winters we have reverted to what is seen as more typical winter weather.

Perhaps this year we have felt cheated by above-average temperatures and just a few frosty mornings.

Now the snowdrops have appeared in the garden it seems that spring is not too far away.

Prior
to the winter of 2008-09 there had been only one truly harsh winter in 
the previous 17 years – and that began late in the season.

Cold winds first reached us from Siberia in the final week of January 1995, leading to heavy snow showers.

So could there be a sting in the tail this year?

History says it can happen, even after one of the mildest winters on record.

As
recently as last Wednesday the temperature peaked at 12.1C at Hawarden 
in Flintshire, but a band of heavy rain sweeping into the North Sea by 
Thursday brought cold winds and snow showers to higher ground.

The
prospects for the coming week are for the coldest weather so far, with 
hard frosts overnight, snow flurries and perhaps just the higher ground 
seeing any heavy snow.

Spokesman Paul Stephenson said: 'If 
you're out in the rural areas the main roads are beautifully clear, but 
our parish is split into a hamlet and village either side of a ridge 
with a steep hill on one side and open moorland.

'The situation is that there is just 
not the resources for the Highways to cope with the snow, we just have 
to wait, and the reality is waiting up to a week before there is 
clearance of our road. But we're not trying to emulate the speed and 
ferocity of the Highways team.'

He said there were many retired 
residents in the area so 'we were very keen to mechanise' the removal of
snow rather than relying on manpower.

And motorists were being urged to be 
vigilant against thieves who are cashing in on the cold weather by 
looking for drivers who hate getting into an icy car.

Police said the thieves - usually working in a team of two - park in a side street when people are leaving to go to work.

Many drivers nip outside and de-ice 
their windscreens, and leave their engines running to warm up the car 
while they pop back indoors for one last cup of coffee.

One thief sneaks from their getaway 
car, dives into the motor with the engine running and they both tear off
before the owner can run outside to stop them.

Detectives said in a recent incident - in Northampton - a car owner heard their 
vehicle being driven away at speed after going back into the house for a
moment.

A police spokeswoman said: 'It is 
vital that vehicles are clear of frost and snow before driving, but we 
would always advise motorists to stay with their vehicle whilst 
de-frosting, even if it's parked on their front driveway.

'People may assume that nothing will 
happen in a few minutes, however what might only seem like a few minutes
in the house, can provide the small window of time an opportunistic 
thief needs.

'This type of crime is preventable
and we urge members of the public to allow extra time to safely clear 
their windscreens in the morning.

In Eastern Europe, the death toll 
from Arctic conditions has risen to at least 89, and Russian gas 
provider Gazprom has issued a warning over fuel supplies.

In Ukraine, 43 people have died in the past five days, its emergency 
ministry said, as the former Soviet republic shivered through its 
coldest winter in six years. Overnight temperatures sank as low as -33C 
and hundreds of heated tents have been put up to shelter the homeless. 
   

Poland,
Serbia, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic have all been
badly hit - causing schools to close, roads to
be blocked and power cut.

At least 10 people froze to death in Poland as the cold 
reached -26C yesterday.  Malgorzata Wozniak, a spokeswoman for Poland's 
Interior Ministry, said elderly people and the homeless were among the 
dead.

Police
are now checking unheated empty buildings to corral the homeless into 
shelters. Until now, Poland had been having a mild winter with little 
snow and temperatures just below freezing.
