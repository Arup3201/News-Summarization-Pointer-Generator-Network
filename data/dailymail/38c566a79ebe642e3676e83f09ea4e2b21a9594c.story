Relax - this isn't a nightmarish synthesis of animal and vegetable, but merely a squirrel trying on a pumpkin for size.

The hilarious image was captured by photographer Max Ellis, from Teddington, London, who hung the ghoulish fruit in his garden to spook his Halloween-loving children.

But the hungry critters couldn't resist investigating and got there first.

Boo! An inquisitive squirrel stuck its head into a carved pumpkin, creating this memorable image

Mr Ellis revealed the animals initially appeared hesitant - perhaps put off by the frightening faces - but soon got stuck in.

He said: 'My kids love Halloween and beg to start decorating the house and carving pumpkins from about October 1.

'Obviously cut pumpkins only last a couple of days so I carved a small one to keep them quiet.

'I thought we could have a bit of fun with it making it hover spookily in the back garden.

'The squirrels are very inquisitive and love to investigate everything I put out there.

'A floating pumpkin proved more exciting than you could possibly imagine.'

Mr Eliis and the squirrels have become a web sensation after he posted dozens of unusual scenes with them in his garden.

And his latest work is proving just as popular in the build up to Halloween.

He said it takes hours - and occasionally days - to capture the shot, as he has to wait for his subjects to take up the exact stance needed.

Max uses very little retouching in the shots and the squirrels have never been harmed.

He added: 'They are probably better fed than any other wild squirrels on the planet.'
