Abuse: Grandfather Kevin Howes, 55, arrives at court after leading a campaign of hate against neighbours

A grandfather who led a gang that terrorised a couple for over a year after falsely accusing them of being paedophiles has been jailed for 18 months.

Kevin Howes, 55, and the group of 'cowardly' thugs hurled rocks at the terrified family's windows, smeared faeces across their door and pushed maggots through their letterbox.

The gang also poured glue in their door lock and sprayed foam and paint across the front of their home in Norwich, a court heard yesterday.

Howes, who lived in the same street, whipped up the vicious hate campaign against them.

The 'neighbour from hell' grandfather admitted conspiracy to commit criminal damage after police linked calls and texts from his mobile to the yob attackers.

The devastated couple - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - were finally forced out as they feared for their mental and physical health.

Spencer Bowgen, who has a long history of offending,  admitted two charges of criminal damage for his part in the savage abuse.

Bowgen, 26, of Norwich, threw a rock through the couple's window and poured white paint on their door last September. The lout also admitted stealing an iPad from a Virgin Money lounge.

Bowgen was jailed for 17 months while Howes was sentenced to 18 months.

In a statement read to the court the woman said the onslaught had made her life a misery.

She said: 'A long time ago we used to be friends with Howes. We have no idea why he turned on us and caused us four years of hell.'

The traumatised woman had to go to the doctors to be treated for intense stress from the relentless attacks.

Robert Warner, prosecuting, told the court the couple in Norwich had suffered a 'sustained campaign of attacks'.

They would frequently return from their caravan on the Norfolk coast to find their home had been vandalised.

The officers caught Bowgen on camera at 11.30pm on September 4 throwing a rock through the front window.

Five minutes later he sent a text to Howes asking him to ring him.

Two days later Bowgen was captured at 10.30pm hurling white paint from a jar at the home.

The harassment also included threatening texts warning, 'you are both getting it you dirty child abusers'.

The court heard there was no evidence whatsoever to back up the paedophile accusation.

Mr Warner said Howes directed the louts who admitted criminal damage.

Michael Clare, defending, said Bowgen had had a drinking problem.

Mr Clare said Howes was in court 'to face the music'.

He said: 'As a grandfather he ought to know better.  He knows he only has himself to blame.

'As far as he is concerned this business is finished.'

Judge Peter Jacobs branded the men's behaviour 'cowardly'. 'The effect on the couple has been devastating,' he added.

Judge Jacobs told Howes: 'You made their lives hell. There was not a day when they could come home with any peace of mind at all.

'They were always aware that people were watching them, waiting for them to go out.'

Other members of the gang were jailed in April and May for a total of two-and-a-half years after admitting criminal damage.

Shaun Claxton, 50, was jailed for nine months, Neil Smith, 44, for nine months and David Cullingford, 53, all of Norwich, for a year.
