Tragic: Amina Agboola, two, died last Thursday suffering serious internal injuries

This is the first picture of the two-year-old girl allegedly murdered by her mother’s teenage boyfriend.

Amina Agboola died last Thursday after being taken to Peterborough City Hospital with serious internal injuries.

Mother Sarah Raqueman, 28, was arrested on suspicion of causing or allowing the death of a child and has been released on police bail until December.

Her mother’s boyfriend Dean Harris, 19, was arrested on the same day and charged with murder.

Today a handwritten note 'on the mother's behalf' was left on flowers outside Amina’s family home in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire.

It read:

'On the mother’s behalf:

'Sleep tight my little princess, I love you so much. You was such an amazing little girl.

'I love you, so much my princess xxxxxxxxx'

Three women have set up a Facebook tribute page to Amina and are collecting donations to go towards funeral costs.

One post from the fundraisers read: 'Rest in peace little angel you were taken far too quickly, we will get justice for you xxxx'

Mandy Jayne Batchelor wrote: 'R.I.P Amina, you will be sadly missed, such a little cutie :( xx'

Lois Goodge said: 'Still can’t believe this has happen to you amina..how someone could hurt such a innocent sweet little girl..

Tributes: Flowers and notes have been left outside the house in Cambridgeshire for little Amina

'Princess': One wrote 'a beautiful princess taken so young'. Her mother and mother's boyfriend were arrested

Case: Amina's mother's boyfriend, Dean Harris, 19, has been charged with murder, due to plead in February

'I remember 1st seeing you when you were a baby and thinking what a beautiful little girl you are..to think last time I saw you, you where running about full of giggles, and now your in the hands of the angels'

Harris, Ms Raqueman's former next-door neighbour, is not believed to be the girl’s father but the pair were in a relationship and living together.

He has been remanded in custody until his plea hearing at Cambridge Crown Court on February 28 next year.
