Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho spent the night in Belgium to check on the progress of one of his young loanees, Thorgan Hazard.

The 21-year-old brother of Eden has been in stunning form at loan club Zulte Waregem, winning the 2013 Belgian Player of the Year award back in January. He has 16 goals so far this season.

After finishing in a disappointing third place in the Barclays Premier League, scoring 30 fewer goals than Champions Manchester City, the Portuguese manager may be looking to the younger Hazard to help bolster his attack.

According to reports in Holland, Mourinho
 is going to give Thorgan a chance to impress by bringing the youngster 
along to Chelsea's pre-season tour.

Zulte went down 2-1 to Anderlecht in the Belgian Pro League's play-offs - the top 
six sides play each other twice to decide who is named champions.

After
 two impressive seasons with the club, Hazard is much loved by the Zulte 
fans, who unveiled a banner in tribute to the player on his final game. It said: 
'Arrived as "little brother of..." leaving as OUR golden boy.'

Hazard had been in stunning form during 
the mini-competition, scoring five of his team's goals, including one
 in each of the previous three matches which brought two wins and a draw.

The younger Hazard may yet join older brother Eden in Brazil after he made it onto Marc Wilmots' reserve list for the Belgian team.

Thorgan has just one cap, coming on as a substitute for fellow Chelsea loanee Romelu Lukaku in a friendly against the USA in May last year.
