Georgina Dean outside Norwich Crown Court yesterday. It was heard that Dean wore a medical uniform and claimed to work for medical groups

A fraudster who sold cheap mattresses to elderly people for up to £700, claiming they had magical healing powers.

Georgina Dean, 39, who is also known as Elizabeth, paid home visits to vulnerable pensioners while dressed in a medical uniform, Norwich Crown Court heard.

She found her customers by buying a list of residents over the age of 70 on the internet.

Dean told many of her customers that she was part of a larger medical organisation and that the mattresses she was selling could help heal their ailments and illnesses - telling one victim that it would 'stop Parkinsons' disease'.

In fact the mattresses, which she sold for up to £700, could be bought for just £30 on eBay.

Dean was brought before the court following a 
two-year investigation by officers from Norfolk Trading Standards after 
she targeted vulnerable pensioners in the community as part of her scam.

Judge Anthony Bate told Dean that she deserved to go to jail after she was convicted of two counts of fraudulent trading.

But he suspended the her prison sentence as he ordered her to compensate the victims of her scam.

Dean, of Wymondham, Norfolk, operated under two different trading names, Norfolk Eco and the Green Leaf Group, which she claimed were medical organisations, as she targeted pensioners.

The mattresses could be bought for just £30 on eBay but she was selling them at up to £700, her trial at Norwich Crown Court heard in June.

Jamie Sawyer, prosecuting for Norfolk Trading Standards, said: 'She was a one-man band, acting as a sole trader, although she gave the impression to customers she was part of a larger organisation.'

He added: 'Contrary to what she told many of her customers she had no medical training and was in effect a latter day ‘snake oil’ salesman.'

Mr Sawyer said Dean, who used to wear a medical uniform, got a list of potential customers on the Internet targeting people aged 70 or over.

He said she would arrange a home visit and focus on their medical complaints, which varied from diabetes to arthritis.

The daughter of one victim told the court how it was about 'more than the money', saying that her mother's 'confidence has been shaken' as a result of her encounter with Dean.

Mr Sawyer said: 'She would represent that the mat would assist with these conditions, going so far on one occasion as to state that the mat would stop Parkinson’s disease,' said Mr Sawyer.

Matthew McNiff, defending, yesterday insisted that not all Dean’s customers were elderly and said the sales had been 'infrequent'.

He told Norwich Crown Court: 'There was never any attempt for her to hide her name, her address, her contact details.'

Judge Bate yesterday sentenced Dean to nine months in jail suspended for two years.

The fraudster was brought before Norwich County Court following a two-year investigation by officers from Norfolk Trading Standards after she targeted vulnerable pensioners in the community as part of her scam

He said that she had made £4000 from the scam and ordered her to pay back £500 a month compensation.

Sentencing, he told Dean: 'It could be said you richly deserve to go to prison. However, there is a better prospect of the losers being compensated if you are able to retain your liberty and work the losses off.'

Gary Young, principal trading standards officer at Norfolk County Council, said after the case: 'Georgina Dean deliberately set out to target elderly people with known medical conditions.

'She did this by buying a list of potential customers over the age of 70 from the internet. She then went on to cynically scam them.

'This is about more than the money. Mum’s confidence has been shaken to bits as a result of her encounter with Dean' - Carol, daughter of one of Dean's victims

'Dean earned her victims’ trust by dressing in a medical uniform when she visited them and claiming to be part of medical organisations.'

He added: 'She built up relationships with her “clients” by phoning them at home, appearing to be concerned about their medical problems by asking them further questions, telling them she had something which could help alleviate their condition and arranging a home visit to demonstrate it.

'She also lied to people to make a sale. One of our witnesses gave evidence in court that Dean told them a mattress she was trying to sell them would "stop Parkinson’s disease"

'If these tactics weren’t bad enough, she would demonstrate a mattress but say that it wasn’t currently available - and that there would be new stock shortly.

Norfolk Trading Standards manager Shaun Norris said: 'This sentence is the result of a thorough investigation of the crimes Dean committed and the horrible way she manipulated her victims.

Carol, the daughter of one of Dean’s victims, who is in her late 80s and lives in Norwich, said last night: 'Dean came round, demonstrated a massage pad and mum signed a piece of paper agreeing to pay £220 for unit and paid £100 cash deposit.'

She said they cancelled the order but her mum had lost her deposit.

'That was tough but this is about more than the money. Mum’s confidence has been shaken to bits as a result of her encounter with Dean,' she said.
