The woman who exposed sexist emails by football chief Richard Scudamore said yesterday she blew the whistle because she felt ‘humiliated, belittled and disgusted’.

Rani Abraham, Scuadmore’s former PA, said she felt a duty to reveal his crude messages about women.

In public, Scudamore, the £2.5million-a-year chief executive of the Premier League, likes to be seen as a champion of equality.

Sexist: Premier League boss Richard Scuadmore's former personal assistant Rani Abraham, 41, said she felt a duty to reveal his crude messages about women

But he may face action as a backlash grows to sleazy emails he wrote mocking ‘female irrationality’.

A crunch meeting of football chiefs is to be held Monday and Tuesday, another meeting will be chaired by Football Association director Heather Rabbatts – the most powerful woman in English football - who has already called for Scudamore to consider his position in light of ‘growing evidence of a closed culture of sexism’ at the Premier League.

Scudamore has already apologised for his emails, sent to senior male colleagues, in which there were jokes about ‘big t****d broads’, ‘irrational’ women and one in which he dubbed a former girlfriend a ‘double decker’ – because she was ‘happy for you to play upstairs but her Dad got angry if you went below’.

Miss Abraham, 41, said she had read the emails because they were automatically forwarded to her as part of her job as Scudamore’s PA. She first revealed them in the Sunday Mirror a week ago.

Yesterday she explained to the same paper she had done it because she was shocked by the emails. She
 said: ‘I found it disgusting, vulgar and very disrespectful. I felt I 
didn’t want to see Richard if that was how he felt about women.

‘I was brought up in a family where women were treated with respect.’ She added: ‘Scudamore started talking about China’s one-child policy being a way to stop women becoming more irrational after having children.

‘I thought, he’s had five children. He’s talking about his wife. How does his wife feel? His wife has been humiliated, so have his daughters.’

She said: ‘For those people who’ve attacked me for saying they were just “jokes”, I wonder how they would feel if their wife or girlfriend or daughter had to read messages like that.

‘And how would they feel if those messages were written about their wife or girlfriend or daughter?’ She said she felt the Premier League, ‘with all its money and influence’, was trying to ‘turn the fire on me to deflect from what he’s done’.

Scudamore – described as the most powerful man in English football - has been boss of the Premier League since 1999.

The
 row has thrown a spotlight on his claims that it strives to be ‘at the 
leading edge’ of the ‘whole equality agenda’. He has pledged £2.4million
 to invest in women’s football.

But
 Casey Stoney, England women’s captain, said: ‘We are trying to get to a
 world without discrimination and to have somebody in such a high 
position in football making derogatory comments about females is not 
acceptable.’

And Anna Kessel, chair of Women in 
Football, said: ‘Women are shocked and dismayed both by the content of 
those emails and by the reaction of the football authorities in dealing 
with this matter.’

Dame Tessa Jowell, former Olympics minister, has said his remarks ‘undermine’ his championing of women’s football.

Several other England women internationals have expressed outrage too, while FA chairman Greg Dyke called them ‘totally inappropriate’.

Sponsor Barclays has also expressed its ‘disappointment’ to the Premier League - raising the stakes ahead of Monday’s meeting of the League’s audit and remuneration committee, which has the power to reprimand Scudamore.

The football boss, who lives with his wife Catherine in a £1.8million home in Cirencester, has apologised for his ‘inappropriate’ emails but said the messages were ‘private email exchanges between colleagues and friends’.

Yesterday the Premier League said in a statement: ‘We do not recognise this characterisation of the working environment at the Premier League, nor do we believe that it can be supported by the facts.

‘The chief executive has already apologised for any offence caused and a proper review of all the evidence is now under way within the Premier League’s established and rigorous procedures.

‘This process is not yet concluded and it is therefore not possible to offer comments in detail at this stage.

'However we will make a further statement in due course ‘The Premier League continues to be fully committed to treating all staff fairly and on merit, regardless of gender.’
