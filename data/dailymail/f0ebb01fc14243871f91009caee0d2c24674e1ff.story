Ever since QPR returned to the Barclays Premier League under Harry Redknapp, they have been confronted by the same weary issues. This Rangers team are weak at the knees.

They have spent the last six months staving off the inevitable and the winter of discontent continued at Loftus Road when Southampton scored a winner in the third minute of added time.

This was supposed to be a more rugged, focused Rangers side after their new director of football Les Ferdinand and his two coaches, Chris Ramsey and Kevin Bond, crashed a few heads together in the week. Instead Nedum Onuoha allowed Sadio Mane to hold him off before turning inside the area to fire beyond Robert Green

It will take a major operation to save Rangers now.

Ramsey and Bond will pick the team for Tuesday’s trip to Sunderland as chairman Tony Fernandes works out what he is going to do with this team. 

‘I am keeping the seat warm but I’ve had a taste for management for a long time,’ said Ramsey. 

‘We had a plan for Southampton but the difficulty is making the players believe in it when we keep losing. We will re-evaluate after Tuesday.’

Southampton returned to third, dreaming of Champions League glory again after Arsenal lost the north London derby. 

Ronald Koeman has redefined this club which is focused on European football after a fourth successive away victory in the league.

‘It is not just about the top four, we want to finish in a European position for next season,’ said Koeman. 

‘Maybe seventh is enough. There are key moments in a season and this is one because of the defeat against Swansea last week.’

This was a key game for Rangers and even the prospect of Tim Sherwood sporting a QPR gillet at their next home game, against Arsenal on March 4, will offer no guarantees.

Ramsey said: ‘I socialise with Tim Sherwood, but I haven’t spoken to him about this.’ No-one believed him.

Assuming he still wants the job after QPR’s 15th defeat in the league, Sherwood will discover that there isn’t a great deal to work with on the training ground. On matchday, it is even worse.

Ferdinand and his two coaches picked a team to play on the front foot, flooding it with forward-thinking players as they searched for their first win in the Premier League since December 20.

Adel Taarabt was the pick of them until his tiring frame was forced to make way for Mauro Zarate midway through the second half

There was the odd flicker from Taarabt, notably a jaw-dropping three-point turn followed by a nutmeg on James Ward-Prowse in the first half.

Their best chance to win it came late in the second half when Southampton keeper Fraser Forster fisted over the bar after Charlie Austin diverted Joey Barton’s shot towards goal.

At the back for Rangers the central defenders, Steven Caulker and Richard Dunne, played as if they had never met each other in their lives. When Eljero Elia split them in the opening minutes, Green came flying out of his area to clean up the mess in front of him. Elia beat him to it but the Southampton forward clipped his effort wide.

Graziano Pelle, without a goal in the Premier League since December 20, hit the bar just before the break.

By then Southampton had been forced to reshuffle their defence when young left back Matt Targett was taken to hospital with concussion. ‘It is under control and the message is that it is positive,’ added Koeman. ‘It is his head and neck, but we think he will be OK.’

When Southampton settled, they controlled much of the game. Morgan Schneiderlin, on the bench until Victor Wanyama made way in the second half, gave them purpose from the centre of midfield.

Beyond that they needed a match winner and Mane was that man when he appeared inside the penalty area to leave Green on his knees.
