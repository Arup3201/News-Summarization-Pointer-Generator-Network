'Miracle man': Jonno Miller, 68, battled liver cancer for four years after being told it was terminal

A father-of-three who was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer died in a car crash on the same day he was given the all clear.

Jonno Miller, 68, was hailed by doctors as a 'miracle man' after defying the disease for four years.

He was killed last week when a lorry smashed into his car on the A30, near Tolvaddon Downs, Cornwall - before he could read the letter that told him he was cancer-free.

Mr Miller and his wife Angie, 48, were driving back to their home in Mount's Nay, near Penzance, Cornwall, last Friday when their green Ford Galaxy was in collision with an HGV lorry on a layby.

Mrs Miller, who was driving, survived the accident with minor injuries but Mr Miller, who was sitting in the front seat, was killed instantly. The lorry driver was unhurt. 

Mrs Miller later arrived home to find an unopened letter from the hospital, addressed to her husband, that said his body was cancer-free.

The couple, originally from Northampton had remote Mount's Nay after Mr Miller's diagnosis because he did not want his three children and two stepchildren to see him dying.

He became a patient of specialist Dr. Harry Dalton at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Treliske who decided to persevere with his treatment, despite his terminal diagnosis.  

Mrs Miller said: 'Jonno became known as Dr Dalton's miracle man. His team at Treliske gave me another four years of love and happiness for which I'm eternally grateful.' 

The Millers' lodger and close friend Ciaran Cardell, a fisherman, said: 'He was such a genuine, nice person - he would go out of his way to help anybody. 

'He was the nicest bloke I've ever met and I'm more proud than I can say to call him father - he called me son and I called him dad.

Determined: Dr Dalton at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, pictured, continued with Mr Miller's treatment despite his diagnosis. The Millers moved to rural Cornwall to spare their children the heartache of watcher their father die

'He'll be dearly missed by too many people. Nobody had a bad word to say about him. He was an absolute gentleman.' 

Mr Cardell added: 'He had all sorts of health problems but he laughed his way through them.

'We have always said that he gave the Grim Reaper a good run for his money but he was still taken too early.'
