Eating a daily portion of rice not only makes dieting easier, but is linked to improved all-round health.

New research shows that consumers can improve their diets simply by enjoying white or brown rice as part of their daily meals.

In a study published journal Food and Nutrition Sciences, study leader Dr Theresa Nicklas, of Baylor College of Medicine, looked at rice intake and diets among more than 14,000 US adults.

She said: 'Our results show that adults who eat rice had diets more consistent with what is recommended in dietary guidelines, and they showed higher amounts of potassium, magnesium, iron, folate and fibre while eating less saturated fat and added sugars.

'Eating rice is also associated with eating more servings of fruit, vegetables, meat and beans.'

Rice is naturally sodium free and has only a small amount of fat, of which none is saturated.

In addition to the positive results in studies linking rice consumption with healthier diets, a human clinical trial found that having white or brown rice at a meal increased feelings of fullness more than a calorically equivalent glucose solution control.

The study found that increasing rice intake not only improved general health but also aided dieting as it made people feel more full

Considering the cross-sectional and clinical findings, both enriched white rice and whole grain brown rice should be recommended as part of a healthy diet, said the researchers.

They added that rice provides about 100 calories per half-cup cooked serving and is naturally free of gluten. Brown rice is a 100 percent whole grain food and white rice is enriched with important nutrients, including folic acid and iron.

Both enriched white rice and whole grain brown rice are considered nutrient-rich quality complex carbohydrates and can be part of a sustainable, plant-based diet that promotes optimal health.

Enriched white rice contributes more than 15 vitamins and minerals, including folate and other B vitamins, iron and zinc to the diet.

Brown rice is slightly higher in dietary fibre, magnesium and phosphorus, but lower in B vitamins and iron than enriched, fortified white rice.

Rice is naturally low in sodium and cholesterol free and contains traces of fat and no saturated or trans fats.
