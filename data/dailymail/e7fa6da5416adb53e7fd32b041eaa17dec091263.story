Poor standards: A study has found that English school leavers had poorer literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills than their grandparents (library image)

The collapse in educational standards was caused by the end of the British grammar school system, experts said last night.

A report this month found that English school leavers had poorer literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills than their grandparents –  the only place among 24 wealthy nations where this was the case.

But a new analysis of the data has found that Britain’s over-55s actually outperform their peers in other countries.

Researcher Dr Gijsbert Stoet said this was down to the quality of British schools in the Sixties and early Seventies.

He added: ‘The general decline in performance is due to the ageing process. The UK was the only country where there was a blip.

‘It would seem that primary and secondary education was so good that it still has an effect today.’ Many grammars were replaced with comprehensives in the Seventies. Today, there are just 164 left.

This decline in selective education corresponds with the last  significant intake of grammar pupils whose scores today as over-55s are so high. Those who  left secondary school in 1975 would be 56.

Dr Stoet, a reader in psychology at Glasgow University’s School  of Education, said that in almost every nation studied, individuals showed a general improvement in the three areas until they reached their mid to late-20s. This was  followed by a sustained fall until retirement, which was put down to ‘general cognitive decline due to ageing’.

But the only exception was the UK, where the older generation significantly outperformed contemporaries in other nations.

He said: ‘The school system changed 
from one where children went to a secondary school based on ability, to 
one where they went to any school, irrespective of ability.

‘It
is most likely many factors played a role in our findings but England 
and Northern Ireland did so unusually well [in the 55-plus age group] 
compared to other countries that it makes sense grammar schools were a 
major factor.’

The first 
comprehensives were set up in 1946, and huge expansion began in 1965 
under Harold Wilson’s Labour government. When the Tories took power in 
1970 it was too late to reverse the decline in grammar schools.

By 1975, most local authorities had abandoned the 11-plus exam and adopted the comprehensive system.

There was also a trend away from ‘streaming’ or ‘setting’ pupils according to ability within state schools under Labour after 1997.

Streaming puts some pupils in the top classes for all subjects, and setting places them in classes in each subject according to ability. 

By 2007, the proportion of lessons taught according to ability stood at just 40 per cent, while in some subjects, such as history and geography, nearly three-quarters of lessons took place in mixed-ability classes.

The original report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development looked at core skills among 16 to 65-year-olds.

Those aged 16 to 24 in England and Northern Ireland came 22nd in literacy and 21st in numeracy. But 55 to 65-year-olds were among the best educated in the developed world.

The Tories said the findings showed the last Labour government let academic performance slide, even as marks went up.

Dr Stoet suggested exam marks had 
become ‘more realistic’ since Education Secretary Michael Gove demanded 
an end to grade inflation.

He said underperformance among 16 to 55-year-olds compared to other countries could be explained by the comprehensive system.

Experts have criticised the dumbing down of syllabuses, particularly since the Seventies, and the introduction of trendy teaching methods.

Mr Gove is introducing a curriculum that involves more learning by rote and in-depth study.

Education expert Professor Alan Smithers, of the University of Buckingham, said: ‘Grammar schools picked out highly able children  and brought them together with very good teachers and helped them develop.

‘In English there was an emphasis on grammar and being accurate and maths required the ability to carry out basic calculations. Now there is a more cavalier attitude.’

Robert McCartney, of the National Grammar School Association, added: ‘There is no doubt that the advent of the comprehensive was the beginning of a downward trend in literacy, numeracy and problem solving.’
