This is the first glimpse of Rolls Royce's £250,000 supercar - the Wraith.

The brand new model was spotted in the street as one of the engineers at Rolls Royce was testing it on the road before it goes on sale.

The pictures emerged before it had even made its public debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex on the weekend.

The 6.6 litre model was spotted in Hayling Island in Hampshire by Zac Austin, who was quick to photograph the unusual car.

It can be bought in October for £250,000 and is capable of 0-60 mph in just 4.4 seconds.

Although the company says it cannot 
reveal the waiting list for this particular model, it says the mix of 
prospective owners is 'eclectic'.

The Wraith - a Scottish word for 'apparition' or 'ghost' -  is thought to be aimed at a younger, wealthy market than its more stately models.

Rolls Royce owners include David Beckham, Christina Aguilera, Simon Cowell and Sir Alan Sugar.

With luxurious modifications, it is believed it will particularly appeal to footballers as the latest must-have sports car.

Buyers can even specify modifications like a roof lining with 1,340 tiny LED lamps woven in to replicate the night sky.

Its power comes from a 624bhp, 590lb ft V12 engine that has car enthusiasts keenly anticipating its release.

It also features systems like voice activation commands, adaptive headlights and a keyless opening boot.

On the weekend the Wraith distinguished its official appearance at the famous Goodwood Hillclimb at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

It completed the 1.16-mile course in under 60 seconds, reaching 134 mph as the car accelerated past Goodwood House.
