Jubilant Auburn fans flooded the streets after their team won this year’s Iron Bowl as the underdog-no-more in a shocking finale that has stunned the country's college football fans.

The entire field looked like a sea of orange shakers as the celebration continued long after the climactic finale of one of the biggest Iron Bowls in the bitter rivalry's 78-year history.

Fans were seen throwing toilet paper around in trees and on the streets of Auburn to make their mark as this year's winners.

Jubilant! Auburn fans react at the end of a win over Alabama during the second half of an NCAA college football game in Auburn, Alabama on Saturday. Auburn beat Alabama 34-28

Incredible: Fans rush the stadium grounds after the game-winning touchdown, touted as the second-most stunning and improbable play of Auburn's wild season

That crazy tipped pass for a long 
game-winning touchdown is now the second-most stunning and improbable 
play of Auburn's wild season.

Yes, the Tigers found a way to top ‘The Immaculate Deflection’.

Chris
Davis returned a missed field-goal attempt more than 100 yards for a 
touchdown on the final play to lift No. 4 Auburn to a 34-28 victory over
No. 1 Alabama on Saturday, upending the two-time defending national 
champions' BCS hopes and preserving the Tigers' own.

‘We're a team of destiny,’ Davis said. ‘We won't take no for an answer.’

He
delivered a play that deserves its own nickname. Say the Happiest 
Return? Or the saddest, depending on which side of the Iron Bowl you 
sit. Think of some of the most memorable plays in college football 
history - maybe Stanford-Cal, "The Band is on the Field" or Hail Flutie.
This one by Auburn now has a place on that list.

The Iron Bowl is college football rivalry game played annually by the football teams of the two largest public universities in Alabama, the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and the Auburn University Tigers.

The series is considered one of the best and most hard-fought rivalries in all of sports.

As the rivalry was mainly played in Birmingham, Alabama, for many years, the name of the Iron Bowl comes from Birmingham's historic role in the steel industry.

Auburn has always been the underdog as Alabama leads the series 42–35–1.

Davis caught the ball about 9 yards deep in the end zone after freshman Adam Griffith's 57-yard attempt fell short.

He then sprinted down the left sideline and cut back with nothing but teammates around him in a second straight hard-to-fathom finish for the Tigers (11-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference).

‘I knew when I caught the ball I would have room to run,’ Davis said. ‘I knew they would have big guys on the field to protect on the field goal.

‘When I looked back, I said, "I can't believe this".'

Auburn clinched a spot in the SEC championship game with the stunning victory over the powerhouse from across the state.

The Crimson Tide (11-1, 7-1) several times seemed poised to continue its run toward the first three-peat in modern college football, but couldn't put the Tigers away.

Asked if it was the biggest win of his career, Tigers coach Gus Malzahn said: ‘It ranks right up there.’

But he said he'd ‘probably’ still celebrate just like he has since his high school coaching days: With a Waffle House meal.

‘That's what you coach for, that's what these kids play for, to get a chance to win the SEC championship,’ Malzahn said.

The Tigers put it away just when 
overtime on tap. The public address announcer in the stadium had already
declared the game 28-28 at the end of regulation.

But Alabama got 1 second restored and one more play after a review of T.J. Yeldon's run to the Auburn 39.

That
gave the Tide coach Nick Saban a chance to try the long field goal - 
and now he probably wished he never did, given the stunning result.

‘It was a great game,’ Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron said. ‘Sometimes luck just isn't on your side.

‘It's
one of those crazy plays. It's almost like a video game. That's 
something you do on Madden or NCAA. It's just a wild play.’

A record: According to NCAA records, it was only the fourth time that a missed field goal was returned for 100 yards. The fans are over the moon

The
entire field looked like a sea of orange shakers as the celebration 
continued long after the climactic finale of one of the biggest Iron 
Bowls in the bitter rivalry's 78-year history.

It
lived up to the billing - and then some. According to NCAA records, it 
was only the fourth time that a missed field goal was returned for 100 
yards.

This finale even one-upped Auburn's last-gasp win over Georgia two weeks earlier. A deflected 73-yard touchdown pass from Nick Marshall to Ricardo Louis dubbed "The Immaculate Deflection" with 25 seconds left set up only the second top-five Iron Bowl matchup and first since 1971.

A team that went 3-9 last season and had been destroyed by Alabama 91-14 combined the past two seasons will play for an SEC title and perhaps a trip to the BCS championship game.

Undefeated Ohio State, which was third in the BCS standings this week and figures to move up to second behind Florida State, will have something to say about which teams play for the national title, too. No doubt the Buckeyes, who won their own thriller against Michigan earlier in the day, were celebrating Auburn's win almost as much as the Tigers.

But the Tigers were already making a case to jump the Buckeyes.

Auburn Athletic Director Jay Jacobs told reporters it would be ‘a disservice to college football’ if a one-loss SEC champion was left out of the national title game for Ohio State.
