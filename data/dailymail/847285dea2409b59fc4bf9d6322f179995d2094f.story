Mitt Romney's international trip has won more critics as China and Iran both lashed out against the Republican presidential candidate for his remarks about Israel. 

Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday that Romney risked 'reigniting war' between the Israelis and Palestinians by promising to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed holy city of Jerusalem.

Meanwhile, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the trip to the Jewish state amounted to 'kissing the foot' of Israel.

Criticism: Mitt Romney called Jerusalem the capital of Israel, despite decades diplomatic disputes with the Palestinians over control of the holy city

The newest harsh words for the former Massachusetts governor's three-nation tour are unlikely to hurt Romney, though.

Indeed, criticism from China, the greatest economic rival of the United States, and Iran's Ahmadinejad, one of America's prominent public villains, could even be seen as a boon.

Romney returns to the United States on Wednesday after a trip that President Barack Obama's campaign aides called 'an embarrassing disaster.'

'It’s not that Romney struck out against a major league pitcher. I mean, here he struck out playing tee ball,' mused former deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Colin Kahl.

Last week, Romney angered the British public and drew sharp criticism from Prime Minister David Cameron for questioning whether London was ready for the Olympic games.

His trip to Israel initially included a $50,000-a-plate dinner fundraiser scheduled during a Jewish day of fasting. 

Later, during a fundraiser, he said Israel has prospered economically over the Palestinians because of the 'culture' of its people -- drawing claims of 'racism' from Arabs and even some Jews, who said the remarks played on a dangerous stereotype.

Romney's campaign has strongly denied those accusations.

On Tuesday, Romney's traveling press secretary Rick Gorka told reporters to 'kiss my a**' and 'shove it' when they shouted questions at the presumptive nominee as he left a war monument in Warsaw, Poland.

China's criticism, published in an unsigned editorial by the state-run news service Xinhau, said Romney was making a reckless attempt to win Jewish votes when he called Jerusalem, the disputed city holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims, the capital of Israel and vowed to moved the US embassy there.

Xinhau claimed the assertion 'is likely to worsen the already tense Mideast situation, and even reignite a war between Palestinians and Israelis.'

Romney was also criticized for his 'hawkish' remarks pledging to use 'any and all measures' to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

In Iran, Ahmadinejad used the opportunity of the Israeli trip to take a jab at Romney, a well.

He never mentioned Romney by name, but said the visit was 'kidding the foot' of Israel.

He questioned why the Republican would make 'concessions to get some pennies for (his) campaign?'

Despite the media bluster, Romney's 'gaffes' on his foreign trip will have effectively zero impact on his chances in the November election.

A poll in May found that only one percent of voters said foreign policy was the most important issue in the race.

The foreign trip also garnered front page coverage in several newspapers in the swing states of Florida, Nevada and Ohio -- with on-message stories about his support for Israel, not articles about his slip-ups.
