Emails Hillary
Clinton turned over to a House committee investigating the 2012
attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, show her aides
sometimes used their personal email accounts to communicate with
her through her own private account.

Clinton said during a March 10 press conference that 'the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.'

That, she claimed then, 'meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department' for archiving, where they would turn up in searches conducted in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.

But The New York Times reported on Monday that some of the approximately 300 Clinton emails examined by a congressional committee  suggest otherwise.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton could be waving goodbye to her presidential ambitions if 'email-gate' gets deeper. She spoke at an event hosted by the Center for American Progress on Monday

LOST TO HISTORY? Former State Department Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Huma Abedin (right) was one of her closest aides, and emailed Clinton in a conversation where both women used personal accounts

THE ADDRESS: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis

The emails from Clinton, a presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, do not prove the former
secretary of state ordered a 'stand down,' stopping U.S. forces
from responding to the Benghazi attack or participated in a related cover-up, the newspaper reported,  citing four senior
government officials.

But they do raise new questions about how much of Clinton's correspondence has been lost to history. Federal record retention laws are designed to prevent the kind of archive side-stepping Clinton is accused of carrying on for the four years she led the State Department.

Congress subpoenaed email records last week from 'close to a dozen' people who worked for Hillary Clinton at State.

The Times report is the latest revelation in the saga over
Clinton and her use of a personal email address to conduct
government business, as well as a private computer server to
store that correspondence.

PROBLEMS: Clinton has been dogged by allegations that she purposely hid incriminating emails from the State Department – and from public records requesters – by keeping all her emails on a private server

Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Times that Clinton's
aides primarily used their work email to correspond with her
about government matters, adding that 'only the tiniest fraction
of the more than 1 million emails they sent or received involved
their personal accounts.'

According to the Times, she occasionally exchanged emails with at least four aides via personal accounts while she was
at the State Department, including her foreign policy adviser,
Jake Sullivan; chief of staff, Cheryl Mills; senior adviser,
Philippe Reines; and her personal aide, Huma Abedin.

Abedin used an email address on Clinton's private server in addition to her official 'dot-gov' address. Mills reportedly did the same. 

Clinton has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account, calling it a matter of 'convenience.'

In one email exchange cited by the Times, she asked an aide to assess the performance of a top State official before Congress.

'Did we survive the day?' she wrote.

'Survive, yes,' the adviser responded.

DAMAGE CONTROL? It's not clear what Clinton's inner circle said to her about her turn before the US Senate – the infamous 'What difference does it make?' moment – because the former secretary's emails were outside the State Department's archive system

In separate exchanges weeks later, Sullivan wrote Clinton to reassure her that she wouldn't be held to account in the same way as then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice, who falsely claimed on national television that the death and destruction in Benghazi was the consequence of a protest that spiraled out of control.

'She did make clear our view that this started spontaneously then evolved,' he wrote to Clinton at one point, seeming to reinforce the idea that the Obama administration planned to stick with that assessment..

Later, when the White House began referring to Benghazi as a 'terror attack,' Sullivan told Clinton that in her own publiccomments she had steered clear of the nettles that had snared Rice.

'You never said ‘spontaneous’ or characterized their motivations,' he wrote, according to the Times.

Details on conversations like these are sketchy: The Times wasn't permitted to look at the emails, but relied on descriptions from four different sources.  

COULD IT BE? Housing secretary Julian Castro (right) has been talked about as a potential presidential candidate and would catch momentum if Hillary Clinton's email scandal derailed her campaign hopes

PROBE: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy chairs a special congressional committee looking into the Benghazi attacks, and has subpoenaed emails from 'close to a dozen' current and past Clinton aides

Cheryl Mills (left) was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department and reportedly used an off-the-books email address to trade messages with the then-secretary of state, potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators

BECAUSE I'M HAPPY? Clinton is her party's presumed presidential front-runner, having come in second to Barack Obama in 2008

A spokesman for the Republican-controlled House Select
Committee on Benghazi declined to comment, according to the
newspaper.

Clinton has said she gave copies of all work-related emails
to the State Department, but Republicans, who see her as their
top target in the run-up to the 2016 election, continued to
press for more records.

Last week Republicans asked the State Department to hand
over numerous documents related to Clinton's use of private
email while she was secretary of state and have called on her to
hand over her email server to a third party.

Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who chairs the
House committee investigating Benghazi, has said he does not
think Clinton has given the committee all emails related to the
attack and last week extended the deadline for her to turn them
over.

Clinton claimed March 10 that 'the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses'

@highlight

At least some conversations, though, went through aides' personal addresses

@highlight

That means they happened entirely outside the scope of automatic archiving at the State Department
