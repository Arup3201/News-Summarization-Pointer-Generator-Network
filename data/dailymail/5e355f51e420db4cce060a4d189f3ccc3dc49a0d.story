Joachim Low has said that the Premier League has too many foreigners for England to succeed as national team.

Germany have qualified for every World Cup quarter final since 1938 and Loew said that the collaboration between the Bundesliga and German FA was crucial to the success of the national team.

Speaking ahead of Germany’s World Cup quarter-final against France on Friday, the Germany manager said: ‘If England has a problem, it is that their league has a disadvantage because higher percentage of foreigners, so it becomes difficult for national coach to get things moving.

'We have changed over recent years because lots of young German players in German clubs are given an advantage over foreigners and we’re benefitting from that. In England many foreigners and perhaps that is not always beneficial.

‘I believe we have a good blend in Germany, a strong league with two or three of best teams in Europe. But I’m not unhappy if players are abroad. We can benefit from Sami Khedira and Mesut Ozil having different influences and cultures and coaches. They benefit personally as well and it helps players to mature.’

Loew expects Mats Hummels to have recovered from the flu and is hoping to field a full- strength side despite a mini-epidemic among their squad. ‘About a third of our team were complaining about sore throats,’ said Loew. ‘We were contaminated and we need to see how that develops. Hummels had a fever but all players are able to train. They’re still slightly suffering but there’s no feeling of exhaustion. I hope they stay stable and there is no worsening overnight.’

Loew is expected to play Philipp Lahm in midfield despite calls to switch him to right back with Andre Schurrle and Mario Goetze battling for the final place in the starting eleven.
