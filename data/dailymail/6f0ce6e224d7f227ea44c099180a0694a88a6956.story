It seemed to be the duffest weather forecast since 1987 when poor old Michael Fish told TV viewers: ‘Hurricane? What hurricane?’ – or words to that effect.

After a summit to discuss unusual weather patterns, it was widely reported that we could be locked in a decade of soaking wet summers. We should have known better. Our forecasters are even less reliable than our weather.

More recent predictions said we would suffer a ‘colder-than-average’ July. The reality has so far proved very different, with the longest heatwave for seven years set to continue.

Meteorologists had talked about a cycle of soggy summers

Blistering heat: Emma Highley, 23, went for a swim in Lumb Fall's waterfall and pool hidden away in the Pennines above Hebden bridge, West Yorkshire, to cool off in the hot weather

And despite there being standing room only on beaches, and our  gardens – as well as our throats – being parched, one Met Office expert was still insisting this weekend that the summer could yet be a washout – and this spell of hot weather could be ‘a blip’.

But these are the facts:

Sunshine is here to stay: Despite forecasters' predictions, the UK will bask in more sunshine next week

Busy beach: The seafront at Brighton as Britain basking in another day of hot temperatures - and it is set to last until next week

Summer sun: People relax by the fountains in Marble Arch, central London, as a Met Office level three heatwave warning remains in force

Police and fire services have also warned people to be careful when swimming in open water following several deaths in recent weeks, including that of a 69-year-old woman in the sea off Skegness, Lincolnshire, on Friday.

So how could our forecasters have got it so wrong? 

Reports of a gloomy forecast came after a
climate summit at the Met Office HQ in Exeter last month, when 
Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office’s Hadley Centre for 
climate research, said the country may be involved in ‘a cycle of wetter
summers’.

A week later, the Met Office’s June 27 forecast predicted a cool and wet month – despite the fact that we are now, happily, on course for the driest July since records began in 1910. The Met Office said the comments had been misinterpreted and denied that there had been a prediction. So on Friday I managed to catch up with Prof Belcher at Reading University to seek an explanation.

Prof Belcher, who heads the university’s meteorology department was doing his best to enjoy the heatwave, rolling up his shirt sleeves, and wearing slacks and trainers. Living on the edge, he even opened his window.

Perhaps it was my Hawaiian shirt, lobster-red forehead and flip-flops but he was beyond tight-lipped when I offered him a courtesy sombrero and beachball.

Our other gift – a Zoom lolly – might have lured him but sadly it had long since melted into a sticky mess.

‘No,’ he said tersely, as I invited him to embrace summer with The Mail on Sunday, before escaping to the shadows behind the university bike shed.

Even though temperatures are forecast to touch 95F this week, scientists and weathermen still fear our summers could be   doomed – blaming the rain on warmer North Atlantic sea temperatures.

Professor Belcher’s colleague Dr Peter Stott – a leading climate change expert who also took part in June’s meeting – said he still believed 2013 could prove to be a washout.

He said: ‘There is a difference between climate and weather. This heatwave could just be a blip and will soon be over in any case – in about two weeks. And if we have a really wet August, this could still go down as a wet summer.’

But he added: ‘There are other factors involved so it’s very hard to predict. Land temperatures are – because of climate change – generally rising.’

Blaze near the beach: A fire, at the beauty spot of Ham Common, on Poole Harbour, Dorset, burned for several hours, destroying giant swathes of protected nature reserve

Heath fire: Sunbathers were forced to flee a beach in Poole, Dorset, as a fire breaked out close to where they were lying. Firefighters said the blaze was a suspected arson attack

Britain's roads struggled to cope with an extra seven million motorists yesterday as sun-seekers headed for the coast and theme parks.

Some areas saw tailbacks of up to 20 miles, with the South of England hit hardest.

About 100,000 sunseekers packed Bournemouth’s seven-mile beach and there were similar scenes at Brighton.

The great getaway coincided with the start of the school holidays in many areas.

‘Our breakdown call-outs are up by about 
10 per cent and most of the calls are to cars which have overheated,’ 
said the RAC. ‘Clearly, everybody has been heading to the beach.’

Heat melts tarmac: A melted road surface in the centre of Cambridge after a prolonged spell of hot weather across Britain. It has gathered around the raised central reservation, which was recently resurfaced for £300,000

Meltdown: Britain has basked in several consecutive days of temperatures higher than 30C - and in Cambridge the road has melted

Meanwhile, a fleet of snow gritters were in action across Hampshire yesterday. A fine stone dust was being sprayed on the roads to stop them warping after the asphalt became sticky in the heat.

However, the scorching hot weather has taken its toll on the UK. Soaring temperatures are believed to have caused up to 760 premature deaths, and the British Red Cross has launched two call centres in Norwich and Ipswich to check on elderly and vulnerable people in the region.

There have been grass fires in several areas of London, mountain blazes in the Welsh valleys. and a large area of Tentsmuir Forest in Fife has been devastated.

l A post-mortem is under way after a teenage girl collapsed at Hinksey Park, Oxford, which was packed with families enjoying the sunshine. The girl was airlifted to the John Radcliffe Hospital but could not be saved.
