Hundreds of seabirds have been washed up along the south-west coast after dying of exhaustion in the recent storms.

The bodies of almost 500 birds, mostly guillemots and razorbills, have been recovered from the beaches of Cornwall, Devon and Dorset after they perished at sea.

Experts at the Dorset Wildlife Trust said consistent gale-force storms in the English Channel during the past month had made it very hard for the creatures to hunt and feed.

The malnutrition coupled with flying in ferocious winds meant they became exhausted and died.

Birds fared even worse across the Channel, where 15,000 puffins were found dead on the shores of France.

The French League for the Protection of Birds said the tragedy could have a devastating effect on the coming breeding season.

The majority of the dead birds have washed up at sheltered Chesil Cove in Dorset, having being swept across Lyme Bay by south westerly winds.

Some conservationists have claimed the birds have been killed by a pollutant similar to palm oil but this has been ruled out by the Dorset Wildlife Trust (DWT).

Mark Smith, of the DWT, said: 'We have probably had 600 birds washed up along the south west coast over the last few days.

'Of these about 130 have been found alive and taken to an RSPCA centre.

'We have had a few puffins but most of the birds have been guillemots and a few razorbills.

'About 300 of them have been found on Chesil Beach. Portland sticks out in the Channel like a giant hand which grabs anything blown from the south west.

'We are putting the deaths down to sheer exhaustion brought about by the adverse weather conditions.

'These birds were exhausted, under weight and suffering from malnutrition as they haven't been able to feed or hunt.

'About 20 per cent of them have had a dark oiling on them but it is impossible to say of this was before or after death.

'It is a similar substance that was around six weeks ago which turned out to be a non-toxic waxy substance that wasn't palm oil.

'In France and the Channel Islands there have been over 11,000 puffins that have washed up dead and none of them were covered in any oil.'

Mr Smith said the birds could have died at any time in the last two weeks and were now being washed ashore.

Lumps of a waxy, white substance have also been discovered along the beaches.

Conservationist Steve Trewhella is attempting to get the mystery pollution analysed to find out what it is and where it came from.

He said: 'There are hundreds of large lumps of what I believe may be palm or vegetable oil all over the beach.

'It is rancid, very smelly and without doubt a risk to humans, pets and any wildlife that may encounter it.

'Warning signs should have been put up alerting people to this pollution.'
