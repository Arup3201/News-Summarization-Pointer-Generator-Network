A selfie-obsessed woman who spent £8,900 on plastic surgery to look picture perfect now earns a living helping people make a fortune using social media.

Triana Lavey, 38, helps her clients make thousands by promoting big brands in their social media feeds.

In a bid to take better selfies and 'look like a supermodel' she had a chin implant, nose job and cheek-defining fat grafts.

Business of a selfie: Triana Lavey, 38, makes her clients thousands by including other company's products in their social media presence. In a bid to take better selfies and look like a supermodel she had a chin implant, nose job and cheek-defining fat grafts

But now she has turned her attention to helping others build online followings - and the larger their social media reach, the more companies pay to feature in the selfies they post.

Clients of the company she works for, uFluencer, can earn between £60,000 and £120,000 a month by including big-name brands in their selfies.

The people she works with include young singers who have huge YouTube followings among teens such as That's Heart, Brandon Berg, Becca Lamin and ItsJudyTime, who are all listed on the company's website.

The 'Ufluencers', as the company cites them on its website, also include Alphacat, who has 3.5m followers, and ItsJudyTime and Sam Pottorff, who have both amassed over 3m followers.

Triana 's bio on the company's website, which employs seven others, states: 'Triana’s experience spans over a decade working as a talent producer and manager for numerous top-tier production companies, including Core Media Group, Relativity Media, and Fremantle, on programs that have aired on NBC, VH1, Showtime, TLC, Animal Planet, and Bravo.'

Triana, from Los Angeles in California, USA, revealed all of her clients are either already well versed in - or coached - how to pose for the perfect selfie.

She believes the ideal pose is for the picture to look fun and organic with their personality resonating through the image - all while looking interested in the product they are paid to promote.

Though Triana underwent surgery to look good in her own selfies she doesn't believe other people have to do the same - they just need to feel confident in front of the camera.

She said: 'We're living in an exciting time - the future is now with regards to social media and I couldn't be happier to be a part of it.

'Advertisers and brands are learning very quickly that eyes are turning away from traditional media and are looking towards digital entertainment.

'Our clients are enjoying the shift by making a business out of their social media presence.

'uFluencer clients are commanding rates in the tens of thousands for a strategically posted selfie with the advertiser's hashtag on it.

'With the massive following they have acquired, advertisers look to them as the tastemakers of their generation and are willing to pay top dollar for a coveted mention of their product in a video or a single post on Instagram.'

She's taught them well! Triana says that her clients are well versed in how to capture the perfect selfie

She added: 'A good selfie is a fun, organic moment documented in a single photo.

'I love selfies that capture someone's personality and show us what they were feeling at that exact moment.'

Triana last month revealed to ABC's Nightline that she 'hated' the way she looked in Facebook and Instagram photographs with her 'weak chin' being the main concern.

 implant, nose job and cheek-defining fat grafts. Two years on, she says
 she's overjoyed with the results.

'I now have the face that I always thought that I had,' the brunette exclaimed. 'I look like myself, but Photoshopped.'

Selfie fan: She added: 'A good selfie is a fun, organic moment documented in a single photo,' she said

Selfie obsessed? 'I love selfies that capture someone's personality and show us what they were feeling at that exact moment,' she said

Justifying
 the need for surgery, she added: 'Your social media presence is just as 
important as your real-life presence. It’s a legitimate form of 
promoting yourself.

'Not everyone is born beautiful and if you can get a little help from a nip-tuck then more power to you.'

While she's ruled out more surgery, Ms Lavey still has regular Botox injections to ensure she looks her best.

'Botox to me is a necessity,' she said. 'It's kind of like in my bills like rent, food, gasoline, medical insurance . . . [then] Botox.'

Ms Lavey noted that before sites like Facebook and Instagram became popular she didn't care so much about the way she looked.

But over the years she became increasingly obsessed with her appearance as unflattering shots cropped up on her profile.
