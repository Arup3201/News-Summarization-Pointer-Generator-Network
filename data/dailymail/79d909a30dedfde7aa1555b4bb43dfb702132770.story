Taskforce: David Cameron asked ministers to draw up ways to confront extremist views in schools, universities and prisons

David Cameron yesterday vowed to ‘drain the swamp’ that has produced a ‘conveyor belt’ of violent Islamic extremists in Britain.

Responding in the Commons to the Tory backbencher and former Army colonel Bob Stewart, the Prime Minister said he wanted to target militants within mosques and universities who were guilty of radicalising potential terrorists.

Mr Stewart, a former commander of UN forces in Bosnia during the Balkans conflict, addressing Mr Cameron, said: ‘Terrorists hide, come from and are sustained by groups of people around them.

‘Could I ask if you will ensure that the taskforce for tackling extremism puts quite a lot of effort to trying to isolate these misguided people away from those that allow them to operate and sustain them?’

Mr Cameron replied: ‘I think you are absolutely right. It is not simply enough to target and go after violent extremists after they’ve become violent. We have to drain the swamp in which they inhabit.

‘And that means looking at the process of radicalisation on our campuses, it means looking at Islamic centres that have been taken over by extremists and gone wrong, it means looking at those mosques who are struggling to throw out the extremists and to help them in the work they are doing.

‘It means going through all of these elements of the conveyor belt to radicalisation and making sure we deal with them.’

Statement: The attack on Drummer Lee Rigby was a betrayal of Islam, the Prime Minister told MPs as he promised to do more to tackle extremism

David Cameron said his new taskforce on extremism and radicalisation would face some tough questions, including:

Mr Cameron was delivering a Commons 
statement on fresh measures to crack down on extremism in the aftermath 
of the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby.

Most significantly, he insisted the 
main political parties must come to an agreement on what should be done 
about the Communications Data Bill, which gives police and security 
services greater access to internet communications.

He said 95 per cent of serious crimes 
now involved the use of modern communications technology and it was 
vital to update the law.

Such a change is opposed by the Lib Dems and 
has been branded a ‘snooper’s charter’ by critics.

A new Government committee on tackling
radicalisation will consider moves to help mosques that want to expel 
extremists and recruit imams who understand Britain.

And it will look at tightening the 
rules on charities which critics say allow extremist groups to flourish,
and at powers to disrupt groups that incite hatred or violence.
