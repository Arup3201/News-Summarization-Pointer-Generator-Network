Despite capitulating defensively at Tottenham, Chelsea managed to cling on to top spot in the Premier League. 

They now find themselves level on points with Manchester City, with the title race primed to become as keenly-contested as last season. 

But Liverpool's pursuit wasn't quite as close as this battle between the champions and Jose Mourinho's Blues.

The pair are not only level on points, but on goals scored, goals conceded, wins, draws and defeats. 

In an astonishing quirk, Chelsea lead the way by alphabetic virtue. 

If this were to be the case at the end of the season, both sides would need to play-off in a one-off clash to determine who lifts the Premier League crown. 

The match would be played at a neutral venue chosen by the Premier League Board of Directors and agreed by both clubs as soon as viable after the season finishes. 

A play-off remains highly unlikely, but would serve as an exciting crescendo for supporters up and down the country.

The FA rules state: 'If at the end of the season either the League champions or the clubs to be relegated or the question of qualification for other competitions cannot be determined because two or more clubs are equal on points, goal difference and goals scored, the clubs concerned shall play off one or more deciding League matches on neutral grounds, the format, timing and venue of which shall be determined by the Board.'

A play-off has never been played before, although league officials did plan for a title-decider between Manchester United and Newcastle at the end of the 1995-96 season.

The match would have taken place on either May 16 or 21 at Wembley but United beat Middlesbrough on the final day of the season and Newcastle drew at Tottenham, leaving the Red Devils four points clear at the top of the table.

If a play-off were to happen this season a venue away from London would likely be chosen.
