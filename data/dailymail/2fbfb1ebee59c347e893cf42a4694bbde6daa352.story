Commuters are facing five days of travel disruption as rail workers stage a series of strikes in three separate disputes over issues including pay, pensions and jobs.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union will take industrial action against London Underground (LU), Transport for London (TfL) and the Heathrow Express in the coming weeks.

Underground workers will walk out for 48 hours from 9pm on April 28 and again for three days from 9pm on May 5 in the long-running row over Tube ticket office closures.

Disruption: Following a tube strike in February, commuters are facing five days of travel disruption as rail workers stage a series of strikes starting later this month

Repeat: The latest round of strikes comes after a two-day strike in February caused transport issues across London, and a second planned strike was called off at the eleventh hour

The latest round of strikes comes after a two-day strike in February caused transport issues across London, and a second planned strike was called off at the eleventh hour.

TfL said it would review ticket office closures station by station, which could result in some ticket offices remaining open.

The
concession gave them a two-month breathing space for further talks, but these have now failed - leading to the latest round of strikes.

The first two days of action will take place ahead of a May Day event in London in memory of former RMT leader Bob Crow, and Tony Benn, who died within days of each other last month.

Dispute: The RMT is also staging a strike at the Heathrow Express train service for 48 hours from 3am on April 29 in a row over jobs, pay and cuts

RMT members at TfL, who work in admin roles, will strike for 48 hours from 9pm on April 28 in a dispute over pensions.

The union is also staging a strike at the Heathrow Express train service for 48 hours from 3am on April 29 in a row over jobs, pay and cuts.

The union said plans to re-organise the workforce to save £6 million over the next five years threatened 201 jobs.

'RMT does not buy for a moment the case for handing out savage cuts to Heathrow Express when Heathrow is generating hand-outs to shareholders of over £600 million,' said RMT acting general secretary Mick Cash.

Action: Commuters are pictured walking at Waterloo station in London, England, in an attempt to avoid the crowded tube trains during February's strike

Alternative: Commuters board the extra buses put on to help ease the disruption caused by the last strike at Stratford Station

However, Keith Greenfield, managing director of Heathrow Express, said he hoped that an agreement with the union could be reached.

'We remain eager to continue our productive discussions with RMT union reps and we still hope they choose to resolve the dispute around the table rather than through damaging industrial action,' he said.

'A strike is not the answer. It will increase costs when we are trying to reduce them, taking us further away from what we need to do to secure our business for the future.

'However, we will not let it stop us providing an excellent service for our customers. We have a robust contingency plan that will enable us to run regular trains for as long as any industrial action lasts.'

The union continues to be opposed to plans to close Tube ticket offices on London Underground, saying hundreds of jobs will be lost.

LU maintains that only three per cent of tickets are bought at offices now, and has pledged to switch staff to other areas of stations.
