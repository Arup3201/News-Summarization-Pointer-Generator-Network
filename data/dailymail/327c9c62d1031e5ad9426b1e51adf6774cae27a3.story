Didier Drogba has announced his retirement from international football.

The 36-year-old Chelsea forward posted a statement on his Twitter account confirming he had played his last game for the Ivory Coast.

He said: 'It is with much sadness that I have decided to retire from international football.

'These past 12 years in the national team have been full of emotions. 

Record holder: Drogba scored 65 goals in his 104 caps for Ivory Coast, more than any other player

ACN: Didier Drogba and the Ivory Coast finished runners-up in the 2012 African Cup of Nations

Matches: 104

Goals: 65

World Cups played in: Three

African Cup of Nations played in: Five

Captain since: 2006 

'From my first call up to my last match I have always tried to give my best for my country.

'I am very proud to have been captain of this team for 8 years and to have contributed to placing my country on the world stage of football taking part in 3 World Cups and 2 African Cup of Nations finals.

'I cannot convey enough thanks to the fans for all the love and support during these years. All my goals, all my caps, all our victories are for you - I love you.

'I also owe much gratitude to my team mates - the players with whom I have shared all these emotions and I wish you all much success for the future and a very warm welcome to the new manager.' 

Drogba played 104 games for his country and scored 65 goals, making him their all-time record goal-scorer. Only Kolo Toure and Didier Zokora have played more games for the Ivory Coast.
