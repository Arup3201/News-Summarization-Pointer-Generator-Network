Residents who were expecting an ‘upmarket store’ to set up shop in their leafy village have been left furious after discovering that discount chain Netto is moving in.

Villagers in historic Lymm in Cheshire, who were promised a luxury supermarket as part of a new retail development, had believed a high-end chain such as Waitrose or M&S might be opening its doors.

But after keeping the villagers guessing for almost ten months as to the identity of the store, it emerged that the Danish discount chain, famed for its value goods, would be moving on to the site.

The announcement was met with outrage by residents of the picturesque village, who set up a petition demanding their council oppose the move.

Rob Jones, who has spearheaded the campaign against the discount store, said: ‘The development was described to residents as an upmarket supermarket and that the client wanted to remain anonymous until a later stage.

‘The applicant it would appear is Netto – not a high-end supermarket as promised.’

The plans for the new food store had originally been unveiled last May by the developers, The Brookhouse Group, which boasted of an ‘upmarket store’ creating 35 jobs with parking space for 57 cars.

A public exhibition was also held detailing artists’ impressions. Planning permission was approved but the identity of the retail chain was still kept under wraps.

However, last week residents discovered they were not getting the supermarket they hoped for, after Netto bosses applied for an operating and liquor licence to the Labour-run Warrington Council.

Netto is a Danish discount supermarket which traded in the UK under its own name until it was bought out by Asda in 2010. It launched its first ‘new look’ store in Leeds last year, in a joint venture with Sainsbury’s, promising ‘the best of the low-price discount model with a unique Scandinavian twist’.

Netto is a Danish discount supermarket which traded in the UK under its own name until it was bought out by ASDA in 2010 before returning in November 2014 in a joint venture with Sainsbury's.

Its first 'new look' store was launched in Leeds last November, promising customers 'the best of the low-price discount model with a unique Scandinavian twist'.

Stores offer shoppers more than 2,000 products, according to an online statement. 

Each week, Netto highlights special limited-edition 'Spot Deals' - which have included two sirloin steaks for £3.69 and Andolini Proscecco for £5.50 a bottle - on both food and non-food items. 

In addition to its own branded products, Netto stocks '100 of the most popular brands that people expect to buy in their weekly shop'.

In a statement released in November, the company said that 15 stores would be launched over the coming year. 

The supermarket in Lymm is expected to open later this year. 

Lymm resident Colin Fuller said locals were ‘hoodwinked’ and called for a public inquiry. He said: ‘They very clearly led us to believe it would be a high-end supermarket. We have been misled and conned.’

Conservative Councillor Sheila Woodyatt said: ‘I am not happy as I would have preferred something more upmarket. I just hoped it would be Waitrose or Booths.

‘I know it makes me sound like a terrible snob.’

Almost 200 people have now signed a petition against the store, which is due to open later this year.

The historic village, where the average house price is nearly £300,000, is home to a number of high-profile residents including Coronation Street star Chris Bisson and football legend Sir Bobby Charlton.

Lib Dem councillor Ian Marks said: ‘There is a clear impression that high quality meant an upmarket store – therefore the belief was that it would be a Booths, M&S or Waitrose. Netto is not what people expected.’

A spokesman for Warrington Council said ‘no final recommendation has been made’.

A Netto spokeman said they would ‘surprise our new customers in Lymm’. He added: ‘We’re confident we’ll replicate the success we’ve seen at our other UK sites.’
