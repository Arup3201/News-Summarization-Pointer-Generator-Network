An entire team of senior A&E doctors have resigned from a hospital earmarked for cuts.

Four consultants at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, quit their jobs on Friday, following alleged rows with management.

On the same day a consultant at nearby Worcestershire Royal Hospital also resigned.

It means Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust will have to fill five vacancies in just a matter of months as the doctors work out their notice periods.

Bosses are scrambling to find new staff at a time of unprecedented pressure on A&E departments and a shortage of consultants – a problem which has been highlighted by The Mail on Sunday’s Stop the Casualty Closures campaign.

The shock resignations are a blow to campaigners hoping to save A&E services on the site and follow an apparent breakdown in relations between doctors and managers.

It is understood all four handed in their notices on Friday after being interviewed and accepting offers at neighbouring Warwick Hospital.

The crisis has led MPs to seek assurances from the trust that its A&E will remain fully staffed.

The Alexandra survived a proposed downgrading in 2012 after an independent review warned that Worcestershire Royal could not cope with an extra 6,000 ambulances turning up on its doorstep each year if it closed.

A further review by West Midlands Clinical Senate is due to report this month. Campaigners fear this latest setback could influence a decision, especially if the trust is unable to recruit new A&E consultants or locums in time.

Karen Lumley, MP for Redditch County, said she and other MPs in the area were seeking an urgent response from the Health Secretary.

‘There is always natural wastage of staff but this is different,’ she added. ‘I am shocked and astonished that we have got to this stage. It is the trust’s responsibility to ensure the A&E is staffed properly.’

Dr Richard Taylor, co-leader of political party National Health Action, said: ‘This has been dragging on for years, leaving A&E consultants in limbo over their future amid fears the Alexandra will lose its A&E department. It’s not surprising they’ve decided to find secure, alternative jobs at another hospital.’

Neal Stote, of the Save The Alex Campaign, said: ‘This is devastating news. How has the trust allowed five members of staff to leave on the same day? There’s obviously an underlying problem with the capability of the trust to retain its staff.’

A spokesman for the trust said: ‘While there will always be differences of clinical opinion, all clinicians have had an opportunity to have their say and the final proposed model was endorsed by an Independent Clinical Review Panel in early 2014, subject to some further modifications.’
