The wife of a Labour MP famed for her cleavage-heavy selfies has discovered they have been stolen and used to attract men on dating websites.

But rather than being angry Mrs Danczuk, who is married to Simon Danczuk, 47, has said she is 'flattered' and hopes the women using them 'find love'.

Her face is being used on at least two profiles, one under the name Karen and another for a Lizzie, and said that a friends had spotted them online.

Theft: These pictures of Karen Danczuk have been stolen and used on these dating websites - but she says she hopes the women 'find love'

Shock: One of her pictures appears under the name Karen and another for a Lizzie, and she said  friends had spotted them online

Mrs Danczuk's selfies have become famous, so much so she is selling them on eBay for £10.

The 31-year-old mother of two and Rochdale councillor, has sold hundreds of the prints, which are all personally signed, scented and sent by her. 

Mrs Danczuk is not looking for love herself having married Mr Danczuk in 2012, and the couple have two sons, Milton, six, and Maurice, four.

She told The Sun: 'I couldn't believe it. I think Simon was a bit more freaked out than me — I take it more as a compliment. I hope they find love.'

Earlier this week the councillor posted grabs of the sites on her Twitter feed.

She wrote: 'OMG someone is on a dating website pretending to be me! What happen if they agree to meet a man ha ha? KD'.

The post was accompanied by a screen grab of a profile on the Flurv dating app, which was using the name Karen and featured a picture from her Twitter page.

Cllr Danczuk also posted a screen grab from another profile also using a picture of her from a different dating site.

It was under the name Lizzie Thompson and the photo showed the politician in sunglasses and a low cut top.

She tweeted: 'Morning! I'm on another dating website this time I'm call Lizzie Thompson! Deary me lol. Should I be flattered? KD'.

A fellow Twitter user Sam Goddard replied: 'Would be interesting to see what would happen if this person actually got a date and had to meet someone'.

Another user under the name @TeddyJames- tweeted: 'That's pathetic and creepy! You should report them! LOL'. 

The mother of two has posted more than 60 selfies in the last six months to her more than 25,000 followers.

Her husband has defended his wife, posting on Twitter: 'Proud of my wife — brains and beauty!'

Partners: Mrs Danczuk married Labour MP Simon Danczuk  in 2012 and the couple, of Rochdale, have two young sons

And Mrs Danczuk, who owns a deli with a husband, said the pictures were 'not meant to be sexy.'

She added: 'I've never done a full bikini shot and a lot of my pictures are make-up free. This is something I just do in my own time. 

'I'm very expressive as a person and I think these pictures just help to build up a picture of me. It's where we are as a society. 

'It's a way of taking the blankness out of life when people are often too standoffish. At the end of the day it is just a postcard.

'A lady even said to me the other day it was "so nice for Rochdale to be associated with glamour."'
