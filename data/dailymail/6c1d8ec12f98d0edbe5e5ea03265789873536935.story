Their art bridges the gap between the living and dead, but taxidermists don't consider their jobs morbid. 

These necromancers exude a tender protectiveness over their glass-eyed mounts - an intimate relationship explored by photographer Mike McGregor in his haunting Preserve series.

McGregor snapped the portraits at businesses in the Northeastern U.S. states close to his home.

'The
 hands-on nature of their work captured me. A grizzly might require five hours of nailing and fittings and then another five hours of combing and
 back-combing, identical to the work my stylists perform before a shoot 
with a fashion model,' he said.

'A neat stack of two identical lion pelts can yield
 a lioness that causes childhood nightmares or one that embodies feline 
grace and dignity.'

Growing up around hunters, McGregor remembers the many mounts on the walls of his uncles’ living rooms and always having a freezer filled with generic white wrapped packages ID’d with illegible sharpie scratch.

Although McGregor veered toward the arts, his childhood fascination with sport hunting is reflected in his dark, but beautiful, images.

Ferocious: Dominick Trione from True-Life Taxidermy in Middletown, NY, could never get this close to a Crocodylus acutus or American crocodile if it was alive

In drag: This antelope pops through a plume of peacock feathers

Full frontal: Tony Bochichio from True-Life Taxidermy in Middletown, NY, grips the sullen face of a Syncerus caffer or African buffalo

Fishy: Mark Van Leuven from Buckshot Taxidermy in Sussex, NJ, with the Lepomis macrochirus or bluegill - a species of freshwater fish sometimes referred to as bream, brim or copper nose

Twilight: Katie Innamorato from Innamorato Studios in New Paltz, NY, embraces a skinned Canis lupus or gray wolf

Intimate: Nick Redman from Northeast Taxidermy in Middletown, CT, holds the snout of a Antidorcas marsupialis or antelope

Plucked: Charlie Zgrodek of True-Life Taxidermy in Middletown, NY, holding a droopy Phasianus colchicus or common pheasant

Natural expressions: Experienced taxidermists transform generic headlight-stares into realistic, moment-in-time expressions. This gorilla looks like it's bracing to challenge the alpha male

Part of the herd: Casey Gysin from True-Life Taxidermy in Middletown, NY, surrounded by stuffed animals including the Equus quagga or plains zebra

Royal: Marcus Ribera from Northeast Taxidermy in Middletown, CT, handles the Loxodonta africana or African bush elephant

Purrrrrfection:Taxidermists often flip open different books to get animal expressions and angles perfect

Captive audience: Kurt Fox of Fox Studios in Coldspring, NY, might be holding the reins, but this Equus caballus or wild horse isn't going anywhere

Antique: Mike McGregor was amazed at how each animal¿s back-story bubbled up as the taxidermist manipulated their facial expressions, including this mounted rhino head

Bambi-esque: Tom Delfeico from True-Life Taxidermy in Middletown, NY, gently strokes the Raphicerus campestris or steenbok, a common small antelope of southern and eastern Africa

Preserved: Taxidermists boil the skulls or horns of animals to remove the skin and meat to prevent a bug infestation

Fierce: Blake Freeman from True-Life Taxidermy in Middletown, NY, cuddles with a large Ursus americanus or American black bear

Back to nature: Frank Zitz from Frank J. Zitz & Co. in Rhinebeck, NY, surrounded by a range of animals including the elegant Struthio camelus or ostrich

Whitening: After boiling the skin off, taxidermists put the skull in a bleach bath to whiten them. The bleach also removes the last of the oils

King of the jungle: Joseph Pitruzzello from Northeast Taxidermy in Middletown, CT, gets up close and personal with the Panthera leo or lion

Baby got back: Pascual Perez from Northeast Taxidermy in Middletown, CT, face to face with the Ursus arctos horribilis or grizzly bear
