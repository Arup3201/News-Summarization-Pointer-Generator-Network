Support: Daventry MP Chris Heaton-Harris has said he will help Ian Taylor to get the signs changed

A Tory MP has agreed to help in a father's campaign to rebrand 'mother and child' parking spaces to be gender neutral.

Ian Taylor, 53, is struggling with his local council in Daventry, Northamptonshire, and the operators of a car park near his home to have the signs changed and achieve 'sexual equality'.

And Chris Heaton-Harris is now said to be investigating whether the signs, which show the outline of a woman holding hands with a child, could breach laws on sex discrimination.

Mr Taylor, who has two children, said: 'When I first noticed the signs had gone up I wrote to the district 
council thinking they were responsible.

'It turned out they weren’t, but they said they couldn’t see a problem with what the signs say.

'I
 then wrote to [car park owners] Colliers International 
three times asking if they could do something about the signs, but I 
have never heard a response.

'Because of this lack of action I’ve now written to newspapers, the MP, and other interested parties.

'I’ve already had a message back from Chris Heaton-Harris MP saying he’ll look into the matter.

'We’re
 supposed to have sexual equality in this country, and that goes both 
ways. This is an objective problem - there’s no debate really.

'Everywhere else you see signs that say ‘parent and child’ why can’t they just put them up here?'

Mr Heaton-Harris today told MailOnline that the objections were 'a fair point', and that he would raise the issue with the leader of chief executive of Daventry District Council on Mr Taylor's behalf.

He said: 'Is it as important as unemployment or world peace? Probably not. But it is a fair point.'

A spokesman for Colliers International last night said the firm did not own the site, but managed it on behalf of a client.

A spokesman said: ‘We have been in contact with Mr Taylor several times over the last few weeks and are liaising with both the client and the local council to get these signs changed.’
