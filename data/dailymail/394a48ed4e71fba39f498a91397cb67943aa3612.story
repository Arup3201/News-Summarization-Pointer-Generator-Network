Free man: Robert Lund in the dock in Albi, south west France. Lund, 55, originally from Darwen, Lancashire, was found guilty of killing his wife Evelyn and dumping her body in a lake

A British killer who beat his millionaire wife to death and dumped her body in a lake has been released after serving nine years in prison in France.

Expat Robert Lund, 63, was jailed for 12 years for the manslaughter of wife Evelyn, who vanished from their French farmhouse on December 29, 1999.

The 52-year-old’s decomposing body was only found two years later on the back seat of her car in a lake 15 miles from home, when a drought caused the water level to fall by 30ft.

Lund, from Darwen, Lancashire, was not arrested until 2005, and was first convicted of killing her in 2007.

He appealed the verdict but was jailed for a second time in 2009 by a higher court in Toulouse, south-west France.

He failed in a last-ditch legal bid to clear his name in 2011, so he could claim hundreds of thousands of pounds of his ex-wife’s life insurance, which was transferred to him shortly before she died.

During his final appeal hearing, the court was told how the couple moved from England to the remote village of Rayssac in 1997 after Evelyn’s first husband died of cancer.

Lund insisted throughout the trial that she died in a tragic accident after suffering depression when her ‘idyllic new life’ in France turned sour.

He told the court: 'England had bad memories for her, so we moved to France. The farmhouse we found was just right, and we thought it would be a nice place to live.

'I hoped it would make her happy. When my wife and I moved to France we thought everything would be ideal.'

But he claimed his wife became depressed and began drinking heavily when she decided she no longer wanted to live in France.

Once she hurled a carving knife at him, and on another occasion she tried to throw herself out of a speeding car, he claimed.

He added: 'When she drank, she was extremely violent. I believe that my wife’s problem was depression and she drank because of the depression and it’s a spiral that’s very difficult to get out of.'

She died after driving home drunk from a friend’s house plunging her car into a lake, he said.

But prosecutor Henri Renier branded Lund ‘a liar and a manipulator’.

He said: 'She was a wealthy woman and he wanted her life insurance.

'When she came home on the night she died, they had an argument, he killed her and tried to cover it up by pretending she had disappeared.'

Police had found traces of blood found on Mrs Lund’s clothing and the back seat of her Toyota car, proving she had died as a result of violence, he told the court.

Mr Renier added: 'When her body entered the water she was breathing so little that she did not inhale any water, which indicates that she had already been knocked unconscious.'

During his first two trials, Mrs Lund’s daughter Elizabeth Camden, 42, said her mother had told her marrying Lund had been the ‘worst mistake of her life’.

Mrs Camden said: 'He was aggressive and violent towards her mother and had once left her covered in bruises and unable to get out of bed for a week.

'I warned her about marrying Lund. I told her she shouldn’t do that. Later she telephoned and said I had been right.'

Lund has told a French newspaper that he was freed on 14 September.

He continues to protest his innocence, and says he hopes for another retrial.
