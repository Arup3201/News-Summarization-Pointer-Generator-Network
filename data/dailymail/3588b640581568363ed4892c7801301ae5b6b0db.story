The makers of 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' have forced a Texas restaurant to change its name because it was too similar in appearance to the 2006 Will Ferrell comedy.  

Ricky Bobby’s Sports Saloon -- which opened last summer and is owned by Houston-based strip club operator Rick's Cabaret International -- has changed its name to Pole-Position Sports Saloon and Restaurant, and Columbia Pictures, which owns the movie, will collect $20,000 from the lawsuit. 

Before: Ricky Bobby's Sports Saloon was 'uniquely identifiable with the movie,' film execs said

After: The Pole Position Sports Saloon and Restaurant is the new name after the owners settled a $20,000 lawsuit brought by Columbia Pictures

The racy racing-themed restaurant features scantly clad waitresses, 'smokin hotties,' as well as a sign that read, 'If you ain't first' - both movie references.

The Hollywood executives felt that those examples were 'uniquely identifiable' with the 2006 film 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' and filed the lawsuit in Houston federal court in March, The Star-Telegram reported.

In the movie, the NASCAR-driving title character, played by Will Ferrell, lives by the mantra passed down to him by his father, 'If you ain't first, you're last.' The comedy co-stars John C. Reilly and documents Ricky Bobby's fall from grace and his comeback.

Ironically, Ferrell's character says in the 2006 film, 'that there is trademarked, not to be used without written permission of Ricky Bobby Inc.'

An official with Rick's Cabaret 
International said he will not comment on legal matters. Columbia 
Pictures did not respond to phone calls from the Star-Telegram seeking a
 comment.

The settlement was announced by Rick's Cabaret International during a quarterly sales call in July.

The movie earned approximately $47 million during its opening weekend in 2006, marking the second highest opening weekend ever for an original comedy, Columbia Pictures said in the lawsuit.
