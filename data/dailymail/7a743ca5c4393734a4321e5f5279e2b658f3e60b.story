Sex is the top topic on voyeuristic site Pencourage.com, where subscribers post anonymous diary entries online

Imagine you sit down in a coffee shop and notice a private handwritten journal left abandoned on the table. Would you be able to control your temptation to open it? Or would your curiosity get the better of you?

If you’d 
look away like a good citizen, you’re in the minority. A recent 
experiment that created this exact scenario found one in five people 
surreptitiously picked up the journal and read through the very private 
entries – which included details of sex fantasies and loss of a parent.

The experiment, which was carried out by anonymous social media site Pencourage.com, found that 60% picked up the journal and read it, 77% of whom were women. Only 30% of 
people turned a blind eye and a mere 10% handed it in.

The 
experiment illustrates why Pencourage, which allows subscribers to post 
200-word diary entries without revealing their identity, is proving a 
big hit with us nosy Brits.

The voyeuristic site has racked up over half a million page views with more than 3,000 subscribers creating online diaries in which users share their deepest, darkest and often most embarrassing secrets.

Every day, the writer can upload 200 words to tell their story. They can also pin relevant websites to each journal entry, store pictures appropriate to their stories and upload songs or videos that remind them of the times they are writing about.

But most importantly, subscribers can write about whatever they want - from their affair with the boss to the friend they secretly despise - without anyone discovering their true identity. Usernames and emails are private to everyone, including the website’s staff.

Diarists also often ask advice from their unknown followers about what to do or how to cope in situations.

There are now 23,000 real-life diary entries on the site, which has been dubbed the ‘anti-social network’. Unlike Facebook, where users attempt to portray themselves in the best possible light, Pencourage is a platform for sharing the unadulterated truth.

A recent poll found that 33% of social media users admitted to dishonesty, with a quarter (24%) of women stating they lie or exaggerate on social media between 1-3 times per month, 7% between 3-6 times and a staggeringly untruthful 1% more than 25 times.

On Pencourage.com subscribers post their most private thoughts online but their identity remains unknown

The most common topic respondents lied or exaggerated about was what they were doing (29%), for example, pretending they were doing something exciting when in fact they were home alone. Just under a quarter of respondents (24%) said they lied about how much they drink. One in five fibbed about what they were up to on holiday and about their career. And a cheeky 17% lied about their relationship status.

So why all the smoke and mirrors? The survey found that the top reasons for lying were: ‘I worry people see me as boring’; ‘I feel jealous of other people’s exciting posts’; ‘I don’t have anything to say otherwise’ and ‘I want to impress someone/everyone’.

On refreshingly honest Pencourage, however, no such life airbrushing occurs. One entry about a casual liaison reads: ‘Condom malfunction stopped the activity as soon as we realised but not quite soon enough.’ Not exactly the sort of details posted on Facebook.

Another frank entry reads: ‘I wish after everything I could be happy with myself. But with my ex having driven me crazy, secretly going after my sister throughout the one and half years we were together, it's made me feel fat, ugly, insecure and stupid.’

If Facebook makes you feel you have to compete in the perfect life competition you never chose to enter, Pencourage might just be that dose of unadulterated reality you've been waiting for.

USERNAME: Waiting For a Life

Extract 1: Something strange is going on

As you know, Jon (my ex) came and
stayed with me a few days whilst Hubby was away. It was so good to spend time
with Jon. It reminded me why I loved him and what we once had together and for
a millisecond I was transported back to those days and was wondering why we
split up - but I soon came to.

The Pencourage homepage is bursting with secrets waiting to be read

It seems, however, that Jon stayed in that dream state. He rang today and left
a message saying he very much likes Mr Waiting but that if I ever felt.

I was shocked and super angry. What on earth does he think he's up to? Telling
me that I am even more beautiful than before, that I am a Lady and have a
"real sophistication" doesn't mean I am going to go running to him.

Sure, he has money galore, looks that stop women in the street, manners of a
true gentleman and tastes in culture that make me want to swoon but then
there's Mr W.

Extract 2: Waiting for a life

I woke up this morning with dread
in my mind. It is such an awful feeling. It is worse than a panic attack (for
me) because it is all consuming and lasts for weeks sometimes.

I know what it is about and have looked for help to shake it off but no one
seems to be able to help. Even meditation doesn't help.

It is all about the fact that I feel like I am an empty shell, that I have
lived my life in fast forward, that it has been so packed up with experiences
that now it has come to a stand still. My childhood has consumed 'me' and there
is no way to escape the issue that I have nothing, NOTHING, to look forward to.

Oh sure I have the odd bit and bob but there is nothing that will change my
life, turn it on its head, and I seem to need that. I know I should be content
with what I have but I feel .....
I don't know. Words don't cover it.
