Natascha Kampusch's father Ludwig Koch claims a second man was involved in his daughter's kidnapping and accuses Austrian police of covering up errors

The father of Natascha Kampusch has accused her kidnapper’s best friend of being his accomplice in a book that also claims Austrian authorities covered up a catalogue of police errors in the case.

A secret FBI report into police 
cover-ups over the kidnapping is due to be made public this month.

Justice officials were 
forced to call in neutral investigators from the US agency after 
Natascha’s father Ludwig Koch accused local police of widespread 
political corruption.

He says the strategy to 'avoid a police scandal' allowed the kidnapper’s alleged accomplice Ernst Holzapfel to escape.

Natascha was snatched off the streets of a Vienna suburb in 1998 as a 10-year-old girl on her way to school.

She escaped eight-and-a-half years 
later after enduring years of confinement in a basement cell and sexual 
abuse at the hands of her abductor Wolfgang Priklopil.

Holzapfel claimed he was 'only a business associate of Priklopil, and had little to do with him privately'.

But Koch discovered that the pair
 had nicknames for each other - 'Woody' for Holzapfel and 'Wolfi' for 
Priklopil - and went on skiing holidays together, spent every New
 Year’s Eve together, met regularly in the evenings to go to bars and 
play billiards.

Holzapfel's sister Margit 
Wendelberger even had a relationship with Priklopil and a child by him, according to police files.

She denies the claims - but cannot explain why she dealt with his funeral arrangements and legal affairs or why her daughter inherited one of his three properties.

Koch's claims were detailed in his 
best-selling book Missing, based on 57,000 police files put in the 
public domain by his lawyer.

Natascha’s father claims that police 
were ordered to cover up bungles in the original investigation to 
protect the discredited interior minister Liese Prokop from a political 
scandal in an election year.

'It may sound unbelievable but 
everything in the book is taken directly from the more than 57,000 
police files that were leaked to my legal team,' said Koch.

'It’s not my words. They are facts and evidence from those files.'

Priklopil took his secrets to the 
grave when he hurled himself under a train just hours after Natascha 
escaped while he was making a phone call.

His body was
 never properly autopsied and was cremated within hours to be buried in 
the Holzapfel family plot.

Now Natascha’s father is expecting the FBI report to strengthen his civil case against Holzapfel.

'What Ludwig has said all along and 
what he says in the book is that the police always knew someone else was
 involved,' explained one family friend.

'The first time they investigated, the police were lazy and incompetent.

'Then when she escaped they covered it up because it was too scandalous to admit.

'Now he hopes the truth will finally be dragged kicking and screaming into the daylight.

Koch said: 'The FBI 
report can’t come to any conclusion other than the fact that there was 
massive interference and errors in the case.

'I can’t do more than I have. But win 
or lose, I will have made sure that the information I have has been 
recorded for the history books - where the ultimate judgement will take 
place.'

He says that the evidence leading to Holzapfel after Natasha’s escape - along with evidence that would have led to Priklopil being identified days after the abduction - was ignored.

This included a record of telephone 
calls the pair had made to each other and Holzapfel’s role in helping 
Priklopil escape police shortly before his alleged suicide.

The
 pair met in Priklopil’s car at a shopping centre in Vienna as thousands
 of police officers combed the streets looking for him.

Holzapfel is believed to be the last person to have seen him alive.

The
 book also claims that Holzapfel removed items including computer and 
storage disks from Priklopil's house on the day of the escape while 
police officers stood around outside.

Priklopil also took items from his safe that had vanished by the time he had completed his meeting with Holzapfel.

DNA evidence that showed a third person was in Holzapfel’s car in the two hours after the meeting before it was seized by police.

Holzapfel claims what Koch says is a conspiracy theory and produced a suicide note from his dead friend to prove it.

A police expert, however, claims that the suicide note could not have been written by Priklopil - and more - that it had actually been written by Holzapfel.

When police finally tracked Holzapfel down on the day of Natascha’s escape, they said he started to sweat and appeared nervous.

He then asked: 'Has he killed her?' before police told him why they were there.

And Koch says that, although 
Holzapfel claims he did not know Natascha other than seeing her once 
when his friend came to borrow a trailer, they spoke 100 times on the 
phone after her escape and Holzapfel's wife made her a pink 18th 
birthday cake while she was in captivity.

Natascha
 told her sisters he had even given her a bottle of Baileys as a  
birthday present while Holzapfel’s neighbour gave a statement to say he 
had seen Natascha at his house.

Koch’s
 lawyer Dietmar Heck said: 'We aim to prove [Holzapfel] was involved, 
and even if the court don’t accept that then we believe they have to 
accept that he must have known she was a victim of Priklopil.'

He
 said the files show that Holzapfel knew his friend possessed child 
pornography, knew that he had a tendency to be cruel and was a racist 
who admired Hitler.

Ernst Holzapfel, pictured at a 2006 press conference, claimed to be only a business associate of Priklopil and said he had little to do with him privately

He claims that Holzapfel knew that Priklopi hated foreigners because of his own Mediterranean looks that made it difficult for him to get a girlfriend - the same looks that were described by the witness to the kidnapping.

It is claimed that Holzapfel knew that the kidnap van matched exactly the one that his friend owned, knew that he had no alibi on the day of the kidnapping, and had even asked him what he was going to say to the police when they turned up to question him.

While the interior ministry tried to sweep it all under the carpet, a media frenzy around Natascha led to clashes between her medical team and her lawyers, who tried to get her out to honour contracts with the media. 

At one point there was almost a fight
 between lawyers and doctors as one side tried to drag her away and the 
other tried to get her back into the hospital.

During
 this time, her family were banned from seeing her. Only her lawyers, 
her doctors - and Holzapfel - were allowed to visit her in hospital.

When
 Natasha vanished, Ludwig Koch demanded the investigation not be closed,
 came up with new leads and was frequently in the media appealing for 
help from the public.

Koch
 has won the backing of senior Austrian officials including Herwig 
Haidinger, 59, who was the head of the Austrian equivalent of the CIA at
 the time of the kidnapping investigation.

Natascha was held prisoner at this house in Strasshof and Holzapfel claimed he only met her once when Priklopil borrowed a trailer from him

Also backing him are Ludwig Adamovich, the former head of the country’s constitutional court and Johann Rzeszut, the former president of the Austrian High Court.

Rzeszut said: 'In 43 years in the legal business I have never seen a scandal like this one.'

Koch said: 'People may call me a crank but with people on my team like these it must show there is truth in what I claim.'

Austrian lawyer Dietmar Heck said: 'The contents of the police files are explosive and prove clearly that Wolfgang Priklopil the kidnapper was not alone - and that there was a second man.'
