Prosecution lawyers in the Jodi Arias murder trial have challenged the defendant over phone records and diary entries they say contradict her claims her boyfriend was a pedophile.

Arias, who maintains she was acting in self-defense when she shot Travis Alexander and stabbed him 27 times, has said she walked in on Mr Alexander looking at photographs of young boys.

The defendant has said during her testimony that she fled in disgust. Prosecution lawyers have now pressed her to explain why phone records show five calls between the couple on the same day she allegedly ran away in horror.

Prosecutor Juan Martinez also pointed out that Arias and Mr Alexander exchanged text messages throughout the afternoon and evening at the time Arias claims she found her partner looking at the photographs.

Arias stuck by her earlier testimony, according to an ABC News report.

The prosecution had started their portion 
of the Jodi Arias murder trial on Thursday by aggressively questioning 
her about different stories that they believe she lied about on the 
stand.

They used her own journal entries to 
argue that she lied about a specific explicit sex romp with boyfriend 
Travis Alexander that involved Tootsie pops and Pop Rocks.

Mr Martinez went on to attack her scandalous claims that Mr Alexander was sexually 
attracted to young boys, examining the timeline of the texts that they 
sent one another on the day that she supposedly walked in on him 
pleasuring himself to pictures of minors.

The supposed incident took place months before Arias shot and stabbed Alexander, killing him reportedly in self defense.

Earlier in the trial during her questioning by her defense attorney, Arias said that the reason she missed her friend Lonnie Dworkin's baptism was because she and Alexander were having sex and using the candy as props.

Mr Martinez was verbally sparring with Arias as he pushed her to look at her own journal entries where she gave an alternate reason for missing Mr Dworkin's baptism.

In doing so, Mr Martinez is likely planning on showing that Arias lied about her sex life with Mr Alexander to the court, bringing into question what else she lies about.

At one point, he focused on her 'selective memory' because he said that she said she didn't recall certain points from the trial but was 'able to remember the drink you ordered from Starbucks five years ago'.

'You can tell us what kind of sex you had with Mr Alexander many years ago but you can't remember what you said yesterday or a few days ago?' he said during his quick succession of questions.

She admitted that she had trouble with her memory when she was under stress.

Another issue that he addressed during the first portion of the questioning was the timeline surrounding her damaged finger.

Earlier in the trial, she stated that she and Mr Alexander got in a physical altercation in January 2008 when he threw her on the floor and allegedly kicked her in the ribs and finger.

She told the court that she didn't want to see a doctor for fear of getting Mr Alexander in trouble so they made a makeshift splint, but the finger- her left ring finger- did not heal and is still damaged to this day.

Mr Martinez showed a journal entry that was made after the alleged fight and it made no reference to the fight. He also showed a picture that was taken months after the fight where her hand does not appear damaged.

After the fact: The picture on the screen was taken months after she was supposedly kicked by Alexander when he allegedly damaged her finger, but her finger does not look damaged in the picture

Alternate story: The court was also shown video of an interrogation when she told an investigator that fictitious intruders attacked her and caused the hand injury

He also used a videotaped interview 
that she had with Detective Esteban Flores who was investigating Mr 
Alexander's murder where she said that her finger was damaged on June 4-
the night that she killed Mr Alexander. At that time, however, she was 
making up a story about how two intruders broke into Mr Alexander's 
home, attacking and killing him.

'Whatever you told us in the past is somewhat suspect,' Mr Martinez said in court.

Much of the afternoon was spent parsing over the texts that Mr Alexander and Arias exchanged on the day when she alleged that she caught him pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys.

That allegedly occurred on January 21, 2008. The next day, she claims they had the violent altercation that she says resulted in her left ring finger being damaged.

One of the main points of Mr Martinez' inquiry is her personal journal, where two days after the alleged fight and three days after the supposed discovery of Mr Alexander's alleged sexual interest in boys, she wrote: 'I haven't written because there is nothing noteworthy to report.'

The prosecution comes after eight days where Arias was questioned about her relationship and eventual murder of Mr Alexander.

The
questioning style was predictably nicer during that time than it was 
today, however, since it was her defense attorney Kirk Nurmi doing the 
asking.

Her story: Arias' defense is based entirely around the fact that she killed Alexander in self-defense- which she tearfully told the court on Wednesday- and that she lied multiple times to investigators because she was trying to avoid jail

Contemplation: Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi was a much more gentle questioner when he examined Arias

Wednesday was arguably most explosive day of her murder trial, when Arias testified that there was a 'huge gap' in her memory from June 4, 2008 - the day that Alexander died at his Mesa, Arizona home.

Arias told jurors that she and Alexander had been taking naked pictures in his shower when she dropped his camera, causing him to erupt in a rage, body-slamming her against the tiles and threatening to kill her.

She went on to say that she does not remember stabbing him 27 times but does remember 'accidentally' shooting him.

The trial continues.
