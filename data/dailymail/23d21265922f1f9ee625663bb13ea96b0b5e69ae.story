Far-right political group Britain First is being investigated over claims it is misusing an image of the Queen's crown on its merchandise.

A crown appears on top of an emblem which features on the BNP splinter group's hoodies, caps and beanie hats as well as election leaflets.

It is an offence under both the Trades Descriptions Act 1968 and the Trade Marks Act 1994 to use the image without authorisation.

The far-right political group Britain First, whose leader Paul Golding is pictured, are being investigated over misuse of the image of the Crown on their merchandise

An image on top of the group's badge bears a striking resemblance to the St Edward's Crown, which can only be used with the Queen's authority

The Metropolitan Police has confirmed it is investigating the organisation at the request of the Cabinet Office, which is in charge of who can use royal symbols.

Britain First was formed in 2011 when a number of figures from the British National Party broke away to form their own group.

They have since been accused of inciting racial hatred during their campaigns against the building of mosques and what it calls the 'Islamification' of the UK.

The group's leader Paul Golding is expected to be questioned in relation to the authorised use of the image of St Edward's Crown, one of the most important of the Crown Jewels.

The Cabinet Office had reportedly written to the group asking them to remove the image from their merchandise, but referred the issue to the police when it received no response.

Mr Golding appeared defiant when informed of the police probe, telling the Independent: 'I wish them [the police] the best of luck with their politically-motivated quest.'

A Buckingham House spokesman told the paper that they are aware of the investigation, but it was being dealt with by the Cabinet Office.

The image is a representation of St Edward's Crown, one of the most famous of the British monarchy's Crown Jewels, which is kept in the Tower of London

The image is used to denote royal authority and features on the badges of police and the armed forces. Organisations such as the Royal Regiment of Scotland (pictured) are authorised to use the symbol

Trading laws mean it is illegal to give the false impression that goods are approved by the Queen or to use any 'device, emblem or title' wrongly suggesting a product has links to the Royal Family.

The image of St Edward's Crown replaced the Tudor Crown in 1953 as the image used to show royal authority.

It has since appeared on coats of arms and badges of the military as well as police and other authorities both in Britain and the Commonwealth.

Britain First was last month accused of using the death of former television star Lynda Bellingham to attract visitors to its website.

Facebook users clicked 'like' on pictures of Ms Bellingham, unaware that they had been posted by the group.

Posts on the group’s Facebook site include comments such as calls for British Muslims to be ‘wiped out’ and all non-whites to be deported.
