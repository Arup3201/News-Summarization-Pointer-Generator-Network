Just six per cent of army uniforms were made in Britain last year under manufacturing contracts worth £5million while £75million worth of production was outsourced to India, China and Eastern Europe.

Struggling defence companies in the UK have been forced to lay off staff and open factories overseas in a drive to cut costs or risk losing contracts.

Senior Tory MP Patrick Mercer - a former Army colonel and former security spokesman - claimed there was a security risk involved with making the kit abroad and said 'every soldier should have a uniform made in Britain'.

The staggering figures were released by the Ministry of Defence under a Freedom of Information Act request by Mail Online.

Military kit: Just six per cent of army uniforms were made in Britain last year with the work being outsourced to India, China and Eastern Europe

In total, the Ministry of Defence 
spent £80.6million on kit last year. £42.5million of this was spent 
across the European Union, £5million on the Indian sub-continent, 
£1.5million in north Africa and £27million in the Far East - with most 
of that money going to China.

In contrast, in the US, the law states military uniforms must be made in the United States by US firms.

Last year, a £12million contract to make new camouflage uniforms was handed to the Chinese in a huge snub for UK firms.

Junior defence equipment minister Peter Luff confirmed that the multi-terrain pattern uniforms were being supplied by a British company who had subcontracted the work to China.

Contracts to manufacture specialist badges, buttons and ceremonial uniforms are kept in the UK, in deals worth £2.5million, according to MoD figures.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said they could not confirm exactly where their uniforms are manufactured because they simply don't know.

The department has handed out contracts to supply uniform to 30 companies in Britain over the last year and western Europe and they in turn outsource production around the globe.

Uniforms: The Ministry of Defence spent £80.6million on kit for all of the armed forces last year

Not made in Britain: While army uniforms are being manufactured around the world, in the US all kit has to be made by American companies. Prince Harry can be seen (centre) marking with these troops.

Try and Lilly, which was established in 1864, make military headwear and have axed half of their staff in the last 10 years and outsourced manufacturing to stay afloat.

The Liverpool company still manufacture a small number of bespoke handmade hats for the armed forces on Merseyside but larger orders are made in Eastern Europe to cut costs.

Emma Graham, business development and marketing manager for the company, said: 'We never used to manufacture outside the UK until about 10 years ago when price competition came in.

'In order to keep competing we had to outsource to Eastern Europe. Over time you see contracts drifting away and a change had to be made.

'It is taking jobs away from the UK - our workforce has roughly halved in the last ten years and we have gone from around 30 workers to just 15.'

Dwindling: The majority of large uniform orders are now made outside Britain, a freedom of information request revealed

In contrast, many weapons used by the British army are made by UK defence firms.

For example, the SA80 small arms and the L115A3 long-range 'sniper' rifle are manufactured in Britain.

However, other arms such as the Heckler & Koch 40mm Grenade Machine Gun, which is used by armies around the world, is manufactured in Germany.

Military aircraft are also frequently manufactured overseas. For example, the Eurofighter Typhoon was made by a consortium of Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom defence companies.

The Panavia Tornado was also jointly made and manufactured with Germany and Italy.

The Ministry of Defence said that the majority of large uniform orders are made outside Britain.

A spokesman said: 'Most volume production is sub-contracted by the companies to the major volume production areas of the world; notably the Far East.

'However, some volume production also takes place in Eastern Europe and North Africa. Provided certain environmental and labour standards, which are defined in the contracts, are achieved the Ministry of Defence does not restrict unreasonably where such sub-contracted work is carried out.'

Mr Mercer said: 'I completely understand the need to find the cheapest contracts but you would think the uniforms of our armed forces should be made in the UK.

'If only for security reasons, every soldier should have a uniform that is made in Britain.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'More than half the clothing manufacturing contracts are awarded to companies based in the EU but items may be produced in more than one country.

'Prime contractors are contractually obliged to carry out regular inspections of factories or facilities used by their supply chain to ensure they meet minimum industry standards.'
