Britain is to propose an ‘emergency brake’ that could be applied to prevent large numbers of immigrants arriving from Europe.

A system that would allow the UK to impose a block on incomers from particular countries if numbers become too big is being backed by senior ministers.

Initial negotiations are already under way over what would be a fundamental reform of the EU’s founding principle of free movement of people between countries, Government sources say.

The idea is winning support in Germany and France, which have also seen large influxes of migrant workers from poorer states that have joined the EU.

Senior figures in some of the newer EU states are also said to be open to reform, having seen their economies ‘hollowed out’ by the departure of better educated workers to richer countries.

The ‘emergency brake’ on inflows from European countries would be applied if numbers exceeded expectations.

The proposal will be a central demand of David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU if he wins next year’s general election. It would allow the UK or other countries to bar any further arrivals for a fixed period.

This could prevent a repeat of what happened in 2004, when Labour opted not to impose transitional controls on EU migrants from countries, including Poland, which had joined the EU. The Home Office predicted the decision would lead to around 13,000 additional immigrants a year coming to Britain. But that year, net migration leapt by nearly 130,000.

More recently, the UK has seen a surge in arrivals from southern European countries still mired in economic misery.

Conservative ministers are understood to be prepared to use Britain’s veto to prevent any further expansion of the EU bloc unless free movement is reformed.

They also want new rules to apply to all new member states stipulating their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed.

Suggestion: Home Secretary Theresa May said she and Mr Cameron have suggested that new EU countries should not enjoy full free movement rights until their economy is at a certain level

This is designed to prevent the overwhelming incentive for people to move from poor countries to richer ones. Home Secretary Theresa May, speaking at a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, said: ‘We can control far more of the immigration from outside the EU than inside it.

‘But this is an area where David Cameron and I have said we need to look to the future to talk about the rules, particularly for countries coming into the EU in the future, and putting some sort of brake on their access to full free movement.

‘For example, one idea we’ve suggested is they shouldn’t have full free movement rights until their GDP, their economy, is at a certain level compared to other economies within the EU.’
