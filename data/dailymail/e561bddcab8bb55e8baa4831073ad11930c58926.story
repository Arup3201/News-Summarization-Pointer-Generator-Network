An armed robber is being sought by police following a smash and grab raid in which he threatened staff with a handgun before stealing a haul of Rolex watches and hijacking a taxi to flee the scene.

Thousands of pounds worth of Rolex watches were stolen in the raid at the family-run Laing The Jeweller's in Edinburgh city centre this morning. 

The incident occurred at about 9.30am and police said the suspect stormed the premises with a handgun before making off with a number of 'high value items'.

Officers remain at the scene of the store (above) while investigations continue to trace the suspect. Police said the suspect fled the scene on foot before getting into a private hire car and being driven away from the city

He then fled the scene on foot before entering a private hire car, in which he was driven to the Pilton area of Edinburgh. It is understood there may have been a passenger in the taxi at the time of the car hijacking.

Police said the suspect was last seen when he got out of the vehicle in Pilton Drive North. 

It is believed he is still armed and may have been joined by a number of accomplices.

Police said no one at the jewellers, which was founded in 1840 and sells high quality rings and luxury watches, was injured. However, several members of staff were said to be shaken after the incident.

Police Scotland has now dispatched officers across the city, particularly in the Pilton area, in the hunt for the suspect.

A spokesman said: 'We can confirm we were called to Frederick Street this morning to reports of a robbery taking place.

'Inquiries are still at a very early stage and are ongoing.'

Laing confirmed the incident on Twitter this morning, writing: 'We can confirm that an incident took place at our Frederick St store this morning. This is currently being investigated by Police Scotland.'

A spokesman for the business also told MailOnline: 'Following the incident in our Frederick Street store this morning, we can thankfully confirm that no-one was injured and some valuable items were stolen.

'It has been a stressful experience for our staff so we have taken the decision to close the store for business for the rest of today and let the police focus on their investigations.' 

Laing said no one was injured in the raid but said staff were left shocked and it had been a 'stressful experience'. Police have cordoned off the upmarket store, which will remain closed for the remainder of today

Laing The Jewellers took to Twitter this morning to confirm the incident, which is being investigated by police

Businesses across Scotland took to Twitter to offer support to Laing which suffered the armed raid today

It was met with response from other businesses across the city, including Hamilton and Inches which said: 'Thinking about our colleagues at @LaingEdinburgh after the awful robbery this morning. We hope everyone is okay.'

Eric n Smith, diamond ring designers, added: '@LaingEdinburgh Sorry to read about what happened this morning. Hope you're all OK.' 

The suspect is described as being a man in his early 30s, 5ft 10ins tall and wearing a dark padded hooded jacket, blue trousers, a blue and white scarf and carrying a black and white rucksack.

Detective sergeant Raymond Gray said: 'This robbery left the staff badly shaken but thankfully unhurt.

'We are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the man, or has information about the crime, so that we can trace him as soon as possible.' 

It is not the first time the jewellers has been targeted.

In January last year, a man walked into the store and grabbed a handful of watches – believed to be worth more than £17,000 – before fleeing the shop.

However, the heist was foiled when Ray Mallon, the mayor of Middlesbrough, wrestled the suspect crook to the ground outside the store.

He held the man in a headlock until police arrived and made the arrest.

Speaking at the time, Mr Mallon said: 'I was looking at some watches in the window of a jewellers shop when I noticed a commotion inside. Suddenly a man came sprinting out the door with two assistants chasing after him.

'What happened next was instinctive, it took me back to the old days.

'I stepped across the man and we grabbed hold of each other and wrestled for a few seconds. I managed to get him in a headlock and we ended up on the ground.'

Anyone with information about today's incident which could help police should call 101.
