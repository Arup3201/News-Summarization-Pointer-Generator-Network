A poignant tweet from slain journalist Kenji Goto has provided a powerful message for those mourning his loss after he was beheaded by Islamic State militants. 

The Japanese hostage, 47, is believed to have been killed by a fighter known as Jihadi John after a propaganda video purporting to show his execution was released on Saturday night.

Social media users have now embraced a tweet posted by the freelancer four years ago which offers an insight into his time spent reporting in Syria and Iraq.

It said: 'Closing my eyes and holding still. It's the end if I get mad or scream. It's close to a prayer. Hate is not for humans. Judgment lies with God. That's what I learned from my Arabic brothers and sisters.'

The message of tolerance, posted in September 2010, now has more than 20,000 retweets on Goto's account.

It has resonated with thousands of Japanese Twitter users who have expressed admiration for Goto's reporting about the suffering of children in Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq. 

The journalist's mother and brother have spoken of their loss following confirmation that he had passed away, although the authenticity of the video has yet to be proven.

'Kenji has died, and my heart is broken. Facing such a tragic death, I'm just speechless,' Goto's mother Junko Ishido said.

She added  that her son's death showed he was a kind gentle man, trying to save another hostage.

'I was hoping Kenji might be able to come home,' said Goto's brother, Junichi Goto, in a separate interview.

'I was hoping he would return and thank everyone for his rescue, but that's impossible, and I'm bitterly disappointed.' 

Mr Goto's Twitter account was verified  by his friend Toshi Maeda, who heads Tokyo-based venture Pacific Bridge, which created the mobile-video application Goto used for  his reports.

'He was like a brother to me,' he said. 'He was an inspiration. He was a friend and a colleague,' said Mr Maeda.

This is an alternative translation of Mr Goto's tolerant tweet from the Wall Street Journal 

Yuki Watabe, a 15-year-old high school student in Sapporo, northern Japan, was among those who retweeted the message. 

'He was such a wonderful person,' he said. 'He had a strong sense of doing the right thing.' 

An English translation of the tweet, originally sent in Japanese, was also circulating on Twitter.

Mr Goto was shown with another hostage and his friend, Haruna Yukawa, in a video purportedly by the Islamic State group last month.

Despite negotiations by the Japanese and Jordanian governments, Goto was depicted as dead in a weekend video released on social media accounts affiliated with IS. 

Yukawa was shown apparently dead in an earlier post.
