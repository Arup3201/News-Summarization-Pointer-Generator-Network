Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling will today end their bitter feud in a desperate attempt to salvage the campaign against Scottish independence.

The Labour grandees will appear together at a rally in Dundee to shore up support for Scotland remaining in the UK after Mr Darling's disastrous television debate performance.

The pair fell out after the former chancellor accused the former prime minister of 'hopeless' leadership and 'appalling behaviour' during his time in Downing Street.

But they are thought to have agreed an 'uneasy truce' in hope of boosting the campaign.

Former British Prime Minister  Gordon Brown has made an 'uneasy truce' with Alistair Darling

The future of the 300-year-old union was thrown into doubt as First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond bounced back in the television clash on Monday night.

David Cameron yesterday angered Scots after Downing Street admitted he did not watch the debate. Aides confessed the Prime Minister, on holiday in Cornwall, only watched clips and had seen only 'highlights' of the first debate earlier this month. Supporters of independence said this showed many Westminster politicians do not really care what happens to Scotland.

Angus MacNeil, SNP MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (the Western Isles), said: 'The reality is that like many MPs, Mr Cameron is not really bothered what goes on in Scotland and if we leave. The only thing that bothers him is that he does not want it to happen on his watch.'

A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: 'Perhaps David Cameron is distancing himself from the faltering No campaign.'

A source close to Mr Salmond said: 'David Cameron may not have been paying attention, but the London establishment is now starting to wake up to the fact this referendum campaign is going right down to the wire, and it is the Yes campaign which has all the momentum.'

An average 834,000 Scots watched the debate on BBC One, and a further 1.5million tuned in to BBC Two in the rest of the UK. But many are thought to have been put off by the two campaign leaders shouting over each other.

'Uneasy truce': Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling fell out after the former chancellor accused the former prime minister of 'hopeless' leadership and 'appalling behaviour' during his time in Downing Street

A snap poll found 71 per cent of those questioned thought Mr Salmond won the debate, compared with 29 per cent for Mr Darling, however it did not find a change in voting intentions.

Mr Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, yesterday insisted his camp had the momentum coming out of the second and final debate.

He said: 'I'm not complacent – a lot can happen in the next three weeks – but we have momentum. I've always said I thought this would be a fight right down to the wire, but I am increasingly confident.'

Mr Salmond was widely seen to have needed a win in the debate to help his campaign, which has consistently lagged in the polls.

He has repeatedly called for a debate between him and Mr Cameron. He said: 'Let's have the real leader of the No campaign, David Cameron. Let's see if he can do any better than Alistair Darling did. I don't think he will.'

Mr Cameron, who returns from his holiday at Polzeath today, has already been accused of complacency over the Iraq crisis. 

Downing Street denied Mr Cameron had failed to engage with the Scottish referendum campaign. A spokesman said: 'The key moment is when people go to vote on September 18.'

Mr Brown and Mr Darling's once close relationship ended when the former chancellor gave an interview in 2008 describing the financial outlook as the worst for 60 years. The pair hardly spoke to each other after Labour was kicked out of office.
