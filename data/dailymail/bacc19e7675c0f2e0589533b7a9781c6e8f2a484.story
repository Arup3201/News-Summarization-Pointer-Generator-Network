The challenge of focusing on the job in hand will have never been greater for Scott Quigg, who defends his WBA super-bantamweight world title in Manchester on Saturday knowing that one of the biggest domestic fights in recent years is just around the corner.

A slip against Stephane Jamoye would carry unimaginable consequences for the 25-year-old, such is the prospect of a unification bout against Northern Ireland’s Carl Frampton, the protege of Barry McGuigan and holder of the IBF belt.

Talks between the pair’s representatives have stalled in the past. Quigg’s promoter Eddie Hearn has made Frampton offers well into six figures, while the McGuigans have criticised Hearn’s use of social media in the negotiating dance.

Frampton beat Kiko Martinez in Belfast last weekend to win the IBF world title and Hearn has called on McGuigan ‘to lock himself in a room with me and not come out until we have an agreement — it is our obligation to the sport to make this fight happen’.

Quigg, unbeaten in 30 bouts, won’t be complacent, saying: ‘Those fights won’t happen unless I take care of business on Saturday.’

Hearn is understood to be exploring dates and venues for next spring for Quigg-Frampton, and Quigg said: ‘I am 100 per cent confident if that fight happens that I will have my hand raised at the end.’
