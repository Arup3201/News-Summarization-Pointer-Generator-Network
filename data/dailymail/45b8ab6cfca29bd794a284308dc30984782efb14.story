This must be the ultimate toy for the rich boy who never grew up - a lifesize Airfix-style kit of a classic Aston Martin racer.

Anyone who whiled away their childhoods piecing together the flimsy plastic replicas of World War II aircraft or historic vehicles will recognise the individual body parts waiting to be snapped out of their frame for assembly.

This, though, will cost its buyer some £25,000 when it comes up for auction at the Goodwood Revival festival next month.

Designed as a tribute to the Aston Martin DBR1 that won the 1959 Le Mans 24-Hour Endurance Race, the piece measures almost 21ft long by 11ft tall.

It was handmade by the Hertfordshire-based Evanta Motor Company, which specialises in creating modern-day versions of classic cars.

It includes a composite-material DBR1 body-shell in two parts, in Aston Martin Californian Sage Green with race livery, lights, screens, four 16" Aston Martin wire wheels with Dunlop race tyres and Aston Martin’s three-eared spinners.

There is also a ‘Mota Lita’ 15-inch wood-rimmed steering wheel, a pair of race seats upholstered in Aston Martin-style weave material with leather-bound headrest, a machined aluminium gear knob and gear lever, and a full dashboard finished in textured satin black and assembled using Smiths gauges and period switches.

It even comes with a replica of the Le Mans trophy and an Aston Martin peaked cap signed by the Aston’s two drivers in the famous 1959 race: American Carroll Shelby and Briton Roy Salvadori, both of whom died earlier this year.

The event was regarded as Aston Martin’s finest win, coming after a poor start to the 1959 World Sportscar Championship season.

A second DBR1 driven by Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frere was runner-up.

Ant Anstead, Evanta’s managing director said: 'Aston Martin’s sole Le Mans win of 1959 is a huge part of British motorsport.

'The loss of drivers Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori, and chief engineer Ted Cutting, this year is saddening. We wanted to offer a tribute to these three great men, and to such a beautiful and iconic car.

'And what could be a more fun and fitting tribute than every boy’s dream toy: a life-size model.'

Toby Wilson, Head of the Automobilia Department at Bonhams, which will sell the car, said: 'This piece of artwork is utterly unique, and the attention to detail is fascinating.

'It would be a fantastic centre piece to the collection of any racing enthusiast, and would undoubtedly be a great talking point among friends for years to come.'
