Israel faced being dragged into the Syrian civil war on Monday night after it destroyed an armoured vehicle of president Bashar Assad’s army.

In the first direct confrontation between the countries since the uprising broke out, an Israeli tank scored a 'direct hit' in retaliation for mortar shells that have landed on Israeli-held territory.

Israel has tried to avoid getting sucked into the conflict, but it has grown increasingly worried after a series of stray mortars have struck territory in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.

Israeli military officials say they believe the mortar fire is spillover from intense fighting near the frontier between the Syrian army and rebel forces trying to oust Assad, and not an overt attempt to hit the Jewish state.

But a senior Israeli official said Israel is starting to question that assessment. 'We thought it was spillover, but today we’re not sure,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the issue is still being debated among intelligence commanders.

Syria’s civil war also shook the country’s northern neighbour Turkey, after a Syrian fighter jet bombed a rebel-held area near the frontier, killing at least six people, a Turkish official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.

Israeli officials have long feared that 
the embattled Assad might try to draw Israel into the fighting in an act
of desperation.

In a statement, the military said Israeli tanks targeted the 'source of fire' in Syria after the mortar shell landed in an open area of the Golan Heights. It confirmed 'direct hits' on the targets.

Israeli military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity under army guidelines, said an armoured vehicle carrying 'Syrian mobile artillery' was hit. There was no immediate word on casualties on the Syrian side, but Israeli officials said the vehicle was believed to belong to the Syrian government.

A number of mortar shells have landed in the Golan over the past week, and early this month, Syrian tanks accidentally crossed into a buffer zone along the frontier of the Golan for the first time in nearly 40 years. Israel captured the Golan, a strategic plateau, from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and subsequently annexed it.

After weeks of standing still, Israel responded for the first time on Sunday, firing what it called a 'warning shot' into Syria after another mortar shell strayed across the frontier and landed near an Israeli military post. Israel also warned of a tougher response if the attacks persisted.
