Dozens of tourists were sent running to safety Friday night as a massive fire broke out in the kitchen of TGIFriday’s restaurant near Rockefeller Center.

The flames started in the basement of the building on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th streets before quickly rising up through the roof of the six-floor building and sending a plume of smoke rising into the air above midtown Manhattan, authorities said.

The blaze rose to three alarms just after 9.00 p.m., and well over 100 firefighters were trying to beat back the fire at one point, according to reports.

Fire officials told WABC the inferno did not engulf the building, but rather traveled through it’s ventilation system.

At least 25 fire companies soon flooded Fifth Avenue and brought traffic to a halt.

Pictures posted to Twitter from people on the scene show the flames shooting high into the sky and Fifth Avenue littered with fire trucks, hoses – it has been completely shut down.

The smoke could be seen as far away as Queens and New Jersey, people in Long Island City reported smelling the fire, according to the New York Daily News.

Transit officials were forced to reroute 11 bus lines that would normally traverse the major thoroughfare, an MTA official told WCBS.

The fire was reportedly brought under control within an hour.

Building records cited by the station showed there are kitchens in the basement and on the fourth floor. 

Dining areas stretch from the first to the third floors. Offices occupy the fifth and six floors.

No injuries were immediately reported, but a source told WNBC dozens of patrons were evacuated when the fire broke out.

Fifth Avenue is lined with luxury retailers and high-end restaurants on the blocks surrounding the burning TGI Friday's.

It is normally packed on Friday nights with tourists shuffling between Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central park and St patrick's Cathedral.
