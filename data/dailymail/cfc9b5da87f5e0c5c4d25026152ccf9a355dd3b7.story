A derelict seven-storey building collapsed suddenly onto a busy street in West London leaving a Tube station without power and forcing the evacuation of a bus station.

Witnesses have told how it sounded ‘like a bomb going off’ when part of the 125ft high office block in Hounslow High Street fell to the ground – showering a busy road in rubble – yesterday afternoon.

Hounslow West Tube Station was left without power during rush hour following the incident and a nearby bus station had to be evacuated by police over concerns for safety.

Witnesses said it sounded 'like a bomb going off' when part of the 125ft high office block in Hounslow High Street fell to the ground - showering a road in rubble and cutting off the power supply to Hounslow West Tube

Part of the seven-storey office block's front was left hanging off at an awkward angle and debris was left strewn across the main road following the incident which is believed to have been a sudden accident

Despite Hounslow House being scheduled for demolition, it is thought the huge collapse was an accident which may have been caused by a crane plunging into the front of it.

Part of the office block’s front was left hanging off at an awkward angle and debris was left strewn across the main road following the incident.

Sam Gibbs, who was just yards from the building as it collapsed, described it as ‘terrifying’.

‘My whole office shook,’ he said.

A nearby resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘I know they’ve been working on that site for a while now, because my car is constantly covered in dust.

‘But that can’t have been a controlled demolition - the bang was so loud it sounded like a bomb going off.

‘There was rubble all over the road - it’s a wonder nobody was killed.

‘I heard the building was hit by a 
crane. I’m not sure whether it was an accident or not, but if it wasn’t 
an accident, nobody should be allowed to demolish a building that way.

‘It was so dangerous.’

Despite the office block, which is called Hounslow House, being scheduled for demolition to make way for a new development, it is thought the collapse was an accident which may have been caused by a crane hitting it

Hounslow House was in the process of being knocked down to make way for a possible housing development when the unexpected collapse occurred. Police confirmed no one was injured when the front of the block fell

Others took to Twitter to share news of the incident including Colin Tutty who wrote: 'A crane has hit a building in Hounslow.'

Hounslow House is in the process of being knocked down to make way for a possible housing development - dubbed Tesco Tower after the supermarket’s interest in the site.

Police, firefighters, paramedics and a specialist hazardous team were all called to the scene but officers confirmed there were no reported injuries.

A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said: ‘We were called to the scene at 4:40pm to a building site, where a disused office block had partially collapsed.

‘There were no reported injuries.’

A spokesman for the London Ambulance Service confirmed an ambulance crew, duty officer and the hazardous area response team were also sent but said 'nobody required any treatment.'.

It is understood GBM Demolition, a Lincolnshire-based company, was carrying out the demolition process at the site. However, while no cause has yet been given for the incident, it is thought to have been an unexpected collapse.

GMB Demolition said a statement would be given shortly when contacted by MailOnline.
