Rafael Nadal sensed a changing of the guard despite giving Dominic Thiem a clay-court lesson in their second-round clash at the French Open.

Twenty-year-old Austrian Thiem is one of the brightest talents in the men's game but he will know just how far he still has to go after a 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 loss on Court Philippe Chatrier.

Despite the ease of his victory, Nadal was hugely impressed by Thiem and said: 'I think that our generation is now on the way out.

Too good: The eight-time champion brushed aside his Austrian opponent in straight sets in Paris

'(Andy) 
Murray, (Novak) Djokovic, (David) Ferrer, and (Tomas) Berdych and 
others, (Jo-Wilfried) Tsonga, as well, we have been here for a long 
while.

'A generation is walking away and others will replace us. It will not come overnight, but it will come.

'I
 think that this player has a huge potential and could be one of the 
ones who's going to replace us. His tennis style is really good. What he
 could work on is his footwork and how he moves on the court. That's 
all.'

Thiem really set tongues wagging earlier this month when he beat Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka in Madrid.

That made him the youngest man to beat a top-three player since Juan Martin del Potro in 2009.

Fist pump: The Spaniard celebrates his brisk victory on Court Philippe Chatrier

The
 Austrian, who shares a coach with Ernests Gulbis, is determined to 
learn from his experience, saying: 'It was a great feeling to play on 
this court.

'I expected it, everything that came after. I knew that it's going to be the biggest challenge in my tennis career.

'It's
 really important to play against these guys a lot, because it's more 
important than every practice, I think. I hope I can take a lot with me 
from this match.'

Nadal's
 only defeat at Roland Garros since he won the title on his debut in 
2005 came against Robin Soderling in 2009 and he is bidding to become 
the first man to lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires five times in a row.

But the Spaniard's build-up, with losses in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Rome, put his status as favourite very much in question.

Thiem
 said with a smile: 'I think everybody wants this crisis, which 
everybody says he has. I think there are only a few players who can hurt
 him in this tournament.'

Tricky: The 20-year-old Austrian Dominic Thiem gave Nadal all he had but was outclassed

Nadal
 has been open about the doubts that have crept into his mind since his 
Australian Open final loss to Wawrinka but he gave himself high marks 
for Thursday's performance.

The Spaniard said: 'I think it was a dangerous match. I played the way that I would like to play.'

Fourth
 seed David Ferrer, who lost his first grand slam final to Nadal 12 
months ago, eased through with a 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Italy's 
Simone Bolelli.

There
 was also an impressive victory for American Donald Young, who had never
 won a match at Roland Garros before this year but knocked out 26th seed
 Feliciano Lopez 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3.

The
 24-year-old hails from Chicago like 18-year-old Taylor Townsend, who at
 her first grand slam posted one of the stand-out wins of Wednesday 
against 20th seed Alize Cornet.

Reversing the slide: American Donald Young picked up his second win at Roland Garros against Feliciano Lopez

Young
 said: 'I have known her since she was born. Her and her sisters, it's 
more like a brother/sister type thing than friends because I have known 
them forever.

'I've
 seen her grow up and it's great to see her playing well and winning 
matches. And to be at this level, it's awesome. I'm really excited for 
her.'

Young
 next plays Wawrinka's conqueror Guillermo Garcia-Lopez while there were
 also wins for French duo Richard Gasquet and Gael Monfils, the latter 
now preparing to meet fellow crowd-pleaser Fabio Fognini.

Meanwhile,
 there will be a clash of the giants between 6ft 11in Ivo Karlovic, who 
is playing the best clay-court tennis of his life aged 35, and 6ft 8in 
Kevin Anderson.

In
 Friday's third-round matches, second seed Novak Djokovic has a 
potentially tricky clash against Marin Cilic while Roger Federer meets 
Russian Dmitry Tursunov.
