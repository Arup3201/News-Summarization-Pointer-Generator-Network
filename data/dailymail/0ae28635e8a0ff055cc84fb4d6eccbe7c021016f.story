She may have just published a best-selling book, worked on a collection with Simply Be and be gearing up to return to our screens on The Only Way Is Essex, but that hasn't distracted Gemma Collins from doing what she loves the most.

The bubbly blonde, who embraces her curves and acts as a mouthpiece for plus-size women everywhere, has launched a capsule collection from her very own Gemma Collins range.

Gemma has added a high summer collection to the eponymous plus-size clothing line she first launched last year.

She's back! Following two hugely successful clothing collections that have seen Gemma Collins using her knowledge and experience of the niche plus-size market, she has unveiled a third (Tuscany dress: £75)

The reality star from Romford,
32, says she had so much fun designing for curvy women she has added what she describes as 'fresh, flirty and amazing slinky' clothing to her Gemma Collins range.

Speaking about her new collection, she said: 'There is such a massive gap in the 
market for bigger women as most clothing ranges only offer sizes 8 to 16.

Flirty and fun: She had so much fun designing for curvy women, she has added, what she describes as 'fresh, flirty and amazing slinky' clothing to her Gemma Collins range. (L) Somerset dress, £65, (R) Johannesburg, £35

'I
had such an amazing time working on the latest range – I don’t want 
curvy girls to feel like they should hide away.

'Fashion is all about 
having fun and celebrating your curves with bright colours and prints.'

Key pieces of her range include the vintage-inspired 
lace Bruge dress, the slinky rose-print Tuscany maxi dress, the dip-hem studded Brittany dress designed for the beach and the 
sparkly Egypt dress and matching ‘Istanbul’ waterfall cardigan designed for 
glamorous nights out.

Day to night: Gemma wanted her glitzy glam range to take her from the pool to the bar on her holidays (L) Istanbul, £55 (R) Egypt, £55 

And she loves her designs so much that she has packed every single one into her suitcase ready for her summer holiday.

Speaking to MailOnline, Gemma shared her tips for looking glamorous by the pool.

She said: 'I make sure I wear an amazing kaftan and a good lip gloss.

'I take fresh swimwear with me, plus amazing underwear and gorge wedges. I've packed all my collection so I can mix it up day to night.'

And whilst her co-stars may be following a strict exercise and diet regime before they jet off abroad, Gemma says she isn't following the iconic TOWIE 'no carbs before marbs' diet.

'I haven't been following it at all you know, I'll never give up the el carbio but I have been training four times a week,' she revealed.

With the training helping her to stay focused and motivated, Gemma has grand plans for the future and can't wait to expand her fashion empire.

She said: 'Omg, I have loads of plans for the future! The collection is available to buy in the USA, I'm opening the first plus-size boutique in Brentwood and I'm planning on visiting America and styling the size sexy girls all over the world.'

Rome in Green, £60

Moscow in Nude, £65

Dallas, £30

The Gemma Collins’ Summer Collection is available now from the all new website - www.gemmacollinsofficial.com with prices starting £30.
