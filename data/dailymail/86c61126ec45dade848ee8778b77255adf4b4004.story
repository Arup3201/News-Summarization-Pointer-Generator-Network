A video of two sweet-tempered twin girls locking eyes for the first time has surfaced online and it is absolutely precious.

The video begins with the two girls, called Paula and Alyssa, laying on their parents' bed on their stomachs, facing each other.

Propped up by body pillows, the two appear to recognise the other for the first time, before engaging in a conversation that no one else can understand, occasionally reaching out and grabbing onto each other's hands. 

Their 30-year-old parents, Paul and Ally, admit that though life with twins can be extremely challenging, it's moments like this that also make it very fun and rewarding.

The environment at home is all hands on deck and mum and dad are equally as involved in every aspect of the twins' day. 

'It's a two people job,' the couple said in an email. 'They eat at the same time, they go to sleep at the same time.

Dad, Paul, captured the heartwarming moment when the two realised they had a little playmate for life

Although life with twins can be difficult, their parents admit that moments like these make it all worth it

'They copy each other, but they have very different personalities, though both love to laugh and have a great sense of humour.' 

And they also have similar milestones, since they develop the same - making it that much easier for proud papa Paul to capture this first-time moment on camera.

'It was so awesome to see them realising that they have a little playmate who's just the same as them,' the couple wrote.

'They have similar milestones, since they develop at the same time,' the girls' parents wrote 

The two 'lit up' when they looked at each other, which is when dad, Paul, ran for the camera and began filming

'Every time we would place the babies on their tummies after their meals, we'd see if they would interact and they didn't really,' mum Alyssa added.

'As soon as their dad saw them lock eyes on each other and light up when seeing each other, he knew it was a moment that couldn't have been missed.

'They were filled with love in their eyes and so were we.'
