An extremist cleric linked to Al Qaeda bomb plots in London was on the run in Lebanon last night.

Omar Bakri Mohammad, who is barred from Britain, is wanted over sectarian violence that has cost at least 30 lives.

The Syrian-born radical is suspected of masterminding a series of car bombings and violent clashes in Tripoli on the Lebanese coast.

On the run: Hate preacher Omar Bakri has fled his home in Tripoli, northern Lebanon, after it was raided by authorities looking to arrest him in connection with terrorism

British intelligence officers are said
 to be helping the hunt for the 55-year-old, who once described the 
London suicide bombers of 2005 as the ‘fantastic four’.

Michael Adebolajo, the fanatical killer of soldier Lee Rigby at Woolwich, is an associate from his 20 years living in London.

Bakri
 founded the radical al-Muhajiroun group in Tottenham, North London, 
which is said to have inspired and helped prepare attacks in the UK.

He
 moved to Lebanon in 2005 when anti-terrorist officers began 
investigating his activities. Although he denies any connection to 
atrocities in Britain, he recently admitted that a UK fighter in Syria, 
who blew himself up in a suicide truck bombing, had been his driver 
here.

The Lebanese 
authorities said Bakri, who holds Syrian and Lebanese nationality, was 
wanted on charges relating to endangering national security.

Security 
forces in Tripoli are cracking down on those involved in the clashes 
between the Sunni majority and minority Alawite community in the 
northern city.

Lebanese army soldiers patrol the streets of the Sunni neighbourhood of Bab Tabbaneh and the neighbouring Jabal Mohsen, which is mostly populated by followers of the Alawite sect, in the northern port city of Tripoli

The two communities are deeply divided over the war in 
neighbouring Syria, where they back different sides. Syria’s president 
Bashar al-Assad is an Alawite and members of the Shia sect occupy key 
positions in the government and security forces.

The
 Lebanese army said it arrested 75 people during yesterday’s operation 
in Tripoli, which saw troops moving into the main conflict areas – the 
Sunni district of Bab al-Tabbana and the neighbouring Alawite district 
of Jabal Muhsin. But when the soldiers stormed Bakri’s three-bedroomed 
home in the city centre, they found that he had already fled.

The
 house was said to have been under surveillance for months and Bakri is 
suspected of being tipped off that he was about to be arrested.

He
 has strongly denied any links to the unrest in Lebanon and claims he 
derives a living from selling CDs of his Islamic sermons on holy war. 
Last month he told the Mail: ‘I have quite a following. All over, people
 are following me now so I don’t need any money from UK.

‘But
 if I wanted it, then I’m certain that in just a few days followers 
could raise a million pounds for me. And I have plenty of people here in
 Lebanon who can get the money to me.’

Bakri,
 who claimed asylum in Britain after being kicked out of Saudi Arabia, 
came to prominence in 2004 when he led a protest at the US embassy in 
London in which the name of Osama Bin Laden was chanted and an American 
flag set on fire.

He was also under investigation by Scotland Yard over his allegedly inflammatory language. No charges were brought.

In an internet sermon, he told  listeners they were obliged to join the Mujahidin.

He
 has claimed British people were to blame for the terror attacks in the 
capital because they ‘did not make enough effort to stop its own 
government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan’.
