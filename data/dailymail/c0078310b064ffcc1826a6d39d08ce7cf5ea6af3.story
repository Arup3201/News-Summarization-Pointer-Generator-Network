A 'cowardly' killer who stabbed a City worker in the back in a case of mistaken identity outside a crowded pub has been jailed for 23 years today.

Aytach Lisani, 33, plunged a knife into the back of 34-year-old Christopher Foster in an alleyway in Borough, south London last November, after mistaking him for another man.

Mr Foster, who worked for a law firm and was a single father to his four year-old daughter, had been enjoying a last drink with an old school friend when he was attacked from behind.

He suffered catastrophic internal injuries and died an hour later in hospital.

Lisani, who was at the head of a seven-strong group searching for the intended target, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to murder on the first day of his trial at the Old Bailey.

Today Judge Gerald Gordon sentenced Lisani to life imprisonment with a minimum of 23 years before parole.

Sentencing him, he said: ‘You accept being the man who can be seen on the CCTV making your way up the alleyway were Christopher Foster was innocently standing with his friend.

‘You thrust a large knife forcefully into his back, thereby killing him, not only destroying his own life but also wrecking the lives of his young daughter and his close family.

‘Mr Foster was a complete stranger to the revenge that was being sought.

‘This was the use of a knife in a public place with other innocent people around.

‘It is quite difficult to square the man who committed the cowardly acts you did that night with a man who has reached the age of 33 without conviction or caution.’

Before the sentence was passed, Mr Foster’s mother Jean entered the witness box to read a moving statement about the impact of his death.

She described Christopher Foster as ‘a son to be proud of, a brother to look up to, a loyal friend and devoted loving father.’

Mrs Foster said: ‘He left a lasting impression on those he met wherever he went. He was a kind and generous person.

‘Sometimes he would dress up as a highwayman for Children in Need. He really was a good person to have around.’

Mr Foster had won custody of his young daughter Christina in June 2010 and was planning to visit her at his parent’s house the day after he was killed, the court heard.

Mrs Foster added: ‘He was such a good father, a real hands-on dad. Christina will never see her father again.

'Nobody sees what Christina goes through, it has been heartbreaking hearing her pleas for daddy to come back.

‘I had to sit her down and tell her that her daddy had died. The precious person in Christina’s life has been taken away from her.’

Mrs Foster said that she and her husband were still fighting an expensive battle for guardianship in the family courts.

Billy Dove, who admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, and was jailed for six-and-a-half years 

‘We have not been able to properly grieve for our son as we have been consumed with trying not to lose our granddaughter too', she said. 

‘Our fight in the family court will continue into the New Year and beyond. The end of this trial is not the end of our anguish.’

‘We feel robbed of our son. Our hopes and dreams have been shattered and filled with fears and worries. I cannot even begin to describe the void in our lives, a void that will never be filled.’

Five other men accused of playing a part in the attack were cleared of murder after the prosecution dropped the charge.

However, three of them admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. 

Rocky Djelal, 34, was jailed for six years; Billy Dove, 30, for six and a half years; and Ali Lisani, 38 for seven and a half years. 

The judge told them: 'You have each pleaded guilty to being a party to a conspiracy to cause (the intended target) grievous bodily harm.

'You were each part of a group who were all together by the time you turned the corner and made your way up the alleyway alongside St Christopher's Inn in pursuit.

'That was in revenge for an earlier attack on your friend Salih.

'You Dove set the ball rolling with your call to Salih tipping him off to the presence of [the intended target].

'You Ali Lisani were armed with a baseball bat.

'The Crown accept you are not to be held responsible for the murder in any way save for being party to the creation of the circumstances that enabled the murder to happen.

'But it is inconceivable that anyone involved in that conspiracy did not realise others of the group might be armed with some form of weapon bearing in mind the purpose of the attack and what it was revenge for.'

Mr Foster was stabbed outside the St Christopher's Inn pub, pictured, while enjoying his last drink with a friend 

Ricky Huggins, a 30 year-old jobbing actor who had been due to appear as an extra in Our Kind of Traitor starring Ewan McGregor, and property consultant Mohammed Aalamani, also 30, were both cleared of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and walked free from court.

A seventh suspect, Aydin Salih, is believed to have fled to Cyprus.

The murder took place outside St Christopher’s Inn in Borough High Street during the early hours of 30 November 2013. 

Mr Foster, who had worked for ten years as an office porter at international law firm Pinsent Masons in the City of London, was standing outside with his friend Danny Murphy.

His attackers had wrongly believed him to be another man, who they blamed for an attack on Aydin Salih, the cousin of Aytach Lisani and an associate of others in the group, the court heard.

Salih, who is in Cyprus, was treated at St Thomas's Hospital after he was attacked on September 20 last year, the court was told. 

Prosecutor David Fisher QC: ‘They were having a last drink outside as were a number of people.

‘The atmosphere in that alleyway was good but events were interrupted by a group of approximately seven men whose faces were obscured with hoods and scarves they were wearing.

‘Christopher Foster had his back to the group until the very last minute when he turned.

‘The two men decided to go into the pub but before they could do so Christopher Foster was stabbed once in his back.

‘Both men managed to get into the pub but Christopher Foster had been seriously injured and collapsed.

‘Emergency services were called but despite the efforts of doctors and paramedics both at the scene and at hospital Mr Foster died about an hour and a half after he had been stabbed.’

Mr Fisher said the victim was a ‘totally innocent man’ who had been mistaken for another man who cannot be named because of a court order.

He continued: ‘Christopher Foster had not said or done anything at all that could begin to explain why he was stabbed.’
