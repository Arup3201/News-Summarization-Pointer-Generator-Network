Luis Suarez might still not be able to play competitive football for his new club Barcelona, but the Uruguayan striker is still getting in on the action with his teammates.

The former Liverpool star joined up with Neymar, Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique in an advert for Replay's Hyperflex jeans.

Suarez, who is still awaiting his first competitive game for Barca after being banned for four months for biting Giorgio Chielini during the World Cup, is aptly seen sitting sitting on a bench at the start of the advert.

While male and female models show of the flexibility of the new jeans, Pique and Iniesta begin stretching, bare-foot and dressed identically.

Neymar also features heavily during the advert, before the four players, alongside a very brief appearance from Ivan Rakitic, head and volley the ball, showing how freely they can move in the jeans.

Suarez is the last to strike, and Barcelona will hope he can repeat the powerful acrobatic volley when he returns against Real Madrid later this month.
