Have you paid your credit card bill this month? An hour in the company of The Repo Man is enough to convince anyone never to buy anything ‘on tick’ again.

You don’t want Sean James turning up on the doorstep to take your car away. A Gulf War veteran, 37 years old and built like the side of a Centurion tank, James has a no-nonsense approach to repossessions.

In his tow-truck, James parks on the drive of a house where finance repayments haven’t been made.

Reaching into a car as the driver pulls up, James grabs the keys, soaks up a barrage of abuse and then drives off with the vehicle in tow. It must feel like being mugged by a grizzly bear.

Grizzly: Sean James in C4's The Repo Man

He doesn’t just take cars. If the payments are late, James will take anything — ‘teeth-whitening machines, stone crushers, walk-in chillers, foot-binding machines, we’ve done them all,’ he says.

This doesn’t make him popular. James can’t see why — his victims borrowed money, and chose not to repay. He once collected a Range Rover from a luxury home, and was told by the indignant family: ‘We’ve just come back from a holiday at Disneyland, and now you’ve ruined it!’

And it’s not as if he uses excessive force. ‘People always think I take too much of a hard stance,’ he protests, ‘but they haven’t been run over, they haven’t been told: “We’re going to kill your kids.” ’

He seems to enjoy the rough and tumble of his job, which is handy since some debtors try vigorously to hang on to their goods, using baseball bats, golf clubs, hammers, pickaxe handles and even shotguns.

In the cab of his tow truck, James lets off steam: he rants about the number of immigrant faces he saw last time he visited hospital, and the injustice of paying 20 per cent taxes. ‘We don’t live in a civilised country at all,’ he said bleakly. ‘The human race is s***.’

So it is surprising to watch him caring for his two sons at home, feeding the baby in his high-chair and building Lego spaceships with his older boy.

He clearly dotes on them, and they worship him: ‘He’s like no other dad, he’s always there for me, he’s just really cool basically,’ says ten-year-old Lucas.

And it’s even more unexpected when James reveals he has a second job: painting ‘muriels’, as he calls them, on children’s bedroom walls. The grizzly bear is just a big cuddly teddy — but don’t count on seeing his soft side if he comes for your car.

The flash red Ferrari of education executive Lorraine Donegan might be at risk of repossession in Waterloo Road, as the school goes through one of its frequent financial sticky patches.

The new term of this long-running drama was heaving with excitements — drug-taking, death threats, kidney failure and a 14-year-old having a sex change.

And that was before break.

My favourite scene harked back to more innocent days. Waiting for their English teacher to turn up in class, the pupils took a breather from peddling pills and realigning their genders, and chucked paper aeroplanes around instead.

If someone could teach them how to flick ink pellets, this disaffected bunch might actually start to enjoy education.

Not enjoyable: The Politician's Husband stars David Tennant and Emily Watson

There was nothing to enjoy about The Politician’s Husband. Like the Sunday night period drama The Village, this is a good story concept, ground down into a miserable grey paste.

The characters are uniformly nasty, the cynicism is depressing and the bedroom scenes are brutal. And so much of it wasn’t credible.

Why was David Tennant’s character, ex-Minister Aiden Hoynes, hanging around internet cafes in a hoodie, looking like a terrorist, when he could have sent his anonymous tweets from a pay-as-you-go mobile phone?

Why did he stage his conspiratorial chats right under the Chief Whip’s nose?

Most of all, after that hideous rape scene before the opening credits, why didn’t Emily Watson’s character crack him over the head with a wine bottle and kick him out of the house?

‘We can all do things we’re not proud of,’ Tennant muttered.

And he said it like he was talking about this whole show.
