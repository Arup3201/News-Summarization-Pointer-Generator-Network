President Barack Obama inserted himself into the Arab-Israeli conflict on Friday, issuing a statementÂ  that encouraged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to minimize civilian deaths in its ground push into Hamas-ruled Gaza.

At he same time, he assured him that the U.S. supports Israel's right to self-defense.

'No nation should accept rockets being fired into its borders or terrorists tunneling into its territory,' Obama told reporters in the White House press briefing room.

Half a world away, Israeli troops advanced into Hamas-ruled Gaza while Hamas militants scurried through terror tunnels .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized a deeper incursion into Gaza on Friday, aiming to destroy rocket launching sites and tunnels; Israeli troops fired volleys of tank shells and clashed with Palestinian fighters in a high-stakes ground offensive meant to weaken the enclave's Hamas rulers

Obama said he spoke by phone to Netanyahu earlier in the day over the sounds of sirens going off in the background in Tel Aviv, and told him Secretary of State John Kerry is prepared to travel to the region.

'I also made clear that the United States and our friends and allies are deeply concerned about the risks of further escalation and the loss of more innocent life,' Obama said.

'And that's why we've indicated although we support military efforts by the Israelis to make sure that rockets are not being fired into their territory, we also have said that our understanding is the current military ground operations are designed to deal with the tunnels.'

'And we are hopeful,' he added, 'that Israel will continue to approach this process in a way that minimizes civilian casualties.'

Israel's ground incursion followed a 10-day campaign of more than 2,000 airstrikes that had failed to halt relentless but largely ineffective Hamas rocket fire on Israeli cities.

Israel stepped up its campaign after the Islamic militant group refused to accept an Egyptian truce offer.

Netanyahu said he told his military to prepare for a possible 'significant' expansion of the operation.

Rep. Ed Royce, the California Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, took aim at Hamas, saying that the U.S.-designated terror group 'has rejected multiple offers for a ceasefire, and has continued to attack Israel, including through the use of advanced Iranian-origin missiles.'

'While Hamas deliberately targets Israeli civilians, Israel engages in far-reaching efforts to operate in a way that minimizes the potential for civilian casualties as it attempts to suppress these missiles.'
