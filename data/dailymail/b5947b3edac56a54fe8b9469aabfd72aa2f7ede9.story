The All Blacks have taunted England by claiming their Twickenham performance was a backward step and Stuart Lancaster’s men must play a more attacking game to be world beaters.

England lost 24-21 to the world champions, making it four successive defeats following last summer’s 3-0 whitewash, and the final scoreline flattered the hosts.

Jonny May’s stunning try raised hopes of an England win but they ran out of steam badly in the second half.

New Zealand No 8 Kieran Read, the world player of the year, said: ‘They took us on up front but they didn’t show as much as they did in June (when England lost the series 3-0).

‘They started well, then maybe went away from their strength. They scored a great try by passing the ball but later on they closed up a bit. They will learn a lot from this game.’

Read’s team-mate, fly half Aaron Cruden, agreed that England — who will consider starting George Ford at No 10 against South Africa on Saturday with Owen Farrell at inside centre — went into their shells in the second half.

‘At the start of the second half we felt we got a bit of dominance and England went away from using the ball a bit,’ Cruden said.

‘They reverted a lot to kicking and trying to put pressure on us that way. In the first half they were chancing their arm a bit. They turned down a shot at goal and kicked to the corner.

‘In the second half they reverted to being forward-orientated and kicking the ball. We were expecting them to use the ball more, but we adapted well.’

Lancaster has several selection dilemmas — including the make-up of the back row — ahead of the Springboks, who were surprise losers to Ireland in Dublin.

But despite the latest setback the head coach is adamant his injury-hit side is on track 11 games away from the start of next year’s World Cup.

‘I don’t think in any games we’ve played we’ve felt we’ve been dominated,’ Lancaster said.

‘The first half of the third Test [in New Zealand] is probably the only time. We don’t think the gap is very big at all.’
