A Cairns grandmother was charged with wilful damage to property after she allegedly placed a sticker on a pole.

Four police officers raided the home of Myra Gold, 60, on August 24.

The sticker, which was found by police on a pole at Raintree Shopping Centre, said 'G20 benefits the 1%'.

Ms Gold told Daily Mail Australia the raid was an attack on freedom of speech. 

'It's almost like the Thought Police,' she said.

Ms Gold is accused of placing a tiny sticker, similar to this one, on a pole near Raintree Shopping Centre in Cairns.

As many as 800 extra police are being sent to Cairns to guard the G20 finance ministers' meeting, held on September 20 and 21 at the city's Convention Centre. 

The finance ministers of the G20 - an influential international body - will hold a meeting in Cairns at the weekend.

As many as 800 extra police are set to arrive in Cairns early this week.

'Over in Europe when they have things like this, they have thousands of people turn up to protest,' she said.

'They're allowed to protest. They understand people have a different different view.'

Ms Gold said she has no memory of placing the sticker on the pole. 

She said she never expected this could happen to her. 

'(It) was quite stunning,' she said.

Ms Gold is scheduled to appear in court on October 1.

A spokeswoman for Queensland police refused to comment further because the matter is before a court.
