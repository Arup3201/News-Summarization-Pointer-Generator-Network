The unconventional couple met over Facebook last year after Joan's first husband David passed away in 2011

Joan said: 'I never thought I'd tie the knot again in my lifetime but I just follow my heart.

'Now I'm looking forward to spending the rest of my life with him. I know it's meant to be because we're so right for each other'

Joan was 19 when she met first husband David at a dance in 1965 and the love-struck pair quickly tied the knot.

A devoted wife, she cared for him for 15 years as he battled heart and lung disease, cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes and Alzheimer's.

She said: 'Before David died he told me to get a breast implants and a toy boy after he passed away.

'I was shocked, but I knew he wanted me to enjoy my life. He told me I'd earned it. I know he would be proud of me now.'

Phil popped the question on a romantic holiday in the Canary Islands, and the couple are planning a traditional church wedding, though they have yet to decide on a date for the big day

Joan approached cosmetic surgeon Kevin Hancock for her breast implants and said the transformation had given her a new lease of life.

Her case was so unusual, the story of her new body appeared newspapers and she was inundated with more than 500 messages on Facebook from admirers including Phil, who is only a few years older than her grandson.

She said: 'From the first moment I met Phil I felt butterflies and we just clicked. We are so much in love and our sex life is great - I'm certainly not too old for that.

'Like with David, I knew straight away that Phil was someone I could spend my life with.

'We're like two peas in a pod - it's like we've been together for years.'

The pair, who live together in the home Joan shared with her late husband David, enjoy an active sex life

Phil added: 'Joan has an amazing figure and acts so much younger than her age. I've had relationships with older women in the past but Joan is completely on my wavelength.

'She's amazing and I want to spend all my time with her. It's like my mum says, age is just a number.

Although they are yet to set a date and decide on an engagement ring, the couple is already making plans - but the age-gap may make it difficult to agree on some things.

Besotted Phil says: 'Joan has an amazing figure and acts so much younger than her age', while Joan is just as smitten saying: 'I know it's meant to be because we're so right for each other'

Incredibly, it's Joan who wants a blow-out hen do, complete with stripper, while Phil is more likely to stay at home for a quiet stag.

And Joan would like a romantic Michael Buble song for their first dance but isn't too sure the choice will go down with Phil - who prefers 'ravey' music.

Joan said: 'My first wedding to David was arranged quite quickly so we didn't have a big celebration.

'But this time I want a big white wedding with a beautiful wedding dress.

'Phil and I have want a nice church and a manor house.;

She added: 'All our family are looking forward to the wedding - and Phil's parents are really happy he's settling down.'
