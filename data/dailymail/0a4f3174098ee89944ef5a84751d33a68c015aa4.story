A young Los Angeles TV news anchor has been diagnosed with a brain tumor.

KTTV's 'Good Day LA' team announced on this morning's program that entertainment anchor Julie Chang found the tumor when she underwent a CT scan after a surfing accident recently.

Longtime host Steve Edwards read a statement from Chang in which she thanked her viewers for their support and said she'd be back soon 'stronger and who knows... maybe smarter!'

'LA, thank you,' she said. 'If it wasn't for my move to Southern California, I would've never taken up surfing, which in a way, may have saved my life.'

Chang suffered a black eye about two months ago when her surfboard struck her in the face.

The accident prompted a scan in which doctors spotted the tumor in the young woman's brain. She is set to undergo surgery this week.

'In the next few days and weeks, the tumor will go, the hair will grow back... and I will recover with the warmth you have given me since my first day here on Fox 11,' Chang said in the statement.

Chang relocated to LA about a year ago, after four years at WNYW in New York City, where she was an entertainment reporter.

Previously, she was a general assignment reporter at WPIX.

She added in her statement: 'I have bottled up all the love from my Good Day LA family to take with me into the operating room, so please know that I will be OK.'

Chang is originally from South Korea, but moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, when she was nine years old. At the age of fifteen, her family returned to Korea, but Chang stayed in the United States.

She graduated from the University of Michigan with a B. A. in economics, Chang also attended Oxford University, in Oxford, England, before embarking on a career in journalism.

The reporter has been recognized for her work with a New York State Associated Press Award and a 2007 Emmy nomination.
