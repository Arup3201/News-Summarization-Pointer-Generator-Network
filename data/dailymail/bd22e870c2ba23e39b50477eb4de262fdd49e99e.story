Alan Walker, 67, was spared prison after a 13-year-old boy was injured when he fired his shotgun

A terrorised pensioner has been spared prison after he shot a 13-year-old boy to defend his home.

Alan Walker, 67, from Thorneywood, Nottingham, pleaded guilty to wounding the boy, who had smashed his window and possessing the gun. 

Walker, who is fighting bowel cancer, pulled the trigger on his  shotgun, and the boy was caught by pellets from the exploding cartridges.

Nottingham Crown Court heard yesterday Walker had only moved to the house two weeks before.

Carol, his wife, of 42 years, had died from cancer in 2007 and he moved from their marital home in Boston, Lincolnshire, to be near his grown-up sons who all lived in Nottingham.

But the day after moving in to his new home at the end of November, last year, Walker began to be targeted by youths.

The bungalow had been empty for a year before it was bought by Walker for £125,000. 

During that, youths in the area had used his garden as a short cut to other streets on the estate.

Walker told the youths walking through his garden that they were trespassing - but they responded by pelting the pensioner with apples.

In the following days, there were further incidents of trespass with Mr Walker later admitting to police that he and the youths had 'exchanged words'.

On December 6 Mr Walker was at home when the front window of his lounge was smashed. He called police and had the window replaced.

On December 13, Walker sat in darkness in his living room as the situation escalated and he could take no more.

His dining room window was smashed, as was a window on the Volkswagen car on his driveway.

The pensioner's car was attacked and his front windows smashed at his home in Thorneywood, Nottingham

Walker was standing back from his window when he fired the shotgun, the velocity of the shots absorbed by the glass window, and the pellets spreading 25 centimetres, hitting the boy across the road. 

After the incident, Walker called police and then his son, breaking down as he told him 'I shot him with a gun', the court heard.

Walker told police he feared for his own safety when he fired the gun. 

Michael Evans, defending, told the court Mr Walker had been plagued by anti-social behaviour from almost the moment he moved to his new home.

Mr Evans added: 'Life in that house turned out to be a nightmare, like something out of a horror movie. He sat in darkened rooms hoping people would think he was out. He was terrified and could not sleep.

'On the night he fired that gun his car had been attacked and his front windows smashed. He genuinely believed people were going to come into his house and attack him with weapons.

'On that night he was terrified for his own safety. His motivation was to protect himself. He couldn't take any more. Then to be placed in custody for the first time at his time of life was a truly terrifying experience.'

Dawn Pritchard, for the prosecution, said: 'The pellets of course did have a lethal potential.'

Walker had a wide knowledge of firearms and shooting was his hobby.

'If he wanted to kill someone, he no doubt could have,' added Miss Pritchard.

Judge Michael Stokes QC gave Walker an 18-month prison sentence, to run currently on both charges, suspended for one year, at Nottingham Crown Court

His victim, who cannot be named, told his mother he had been 'blown up' before he was taken to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre.

His injuries were pellet wounds and not life-threatening. He was kept in hospital for two days with non-life threatening shotgun pellet injuries to his hand and head. He is currently subject to a Youth Rehabilitation Order. 

After the incident, Walker was arrested and charged with attempted murder  and spent ten nights in custody before he was granted bail.

In July, Walker, appeared at Nottingham Crown Court to two lesser offences - possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and unlawful wounding. The pleas were accepted by the prosecution.  

Judge Michael Stokes QC gave Walker, who cried in the dock, an 18-month prison sentence, to run currently on both charges, suspended for one year.

He said the pensioner was plainly convinced he was in danger that night, overacted and took hold of the gun.

'Anyone who fires a gun in these circumstances, in a built-up area, is really creating a tremendous risk of serious injury.

'However, I am perfectly satisfied, that when you did what you did you genuinely believed you were in danger.

'You were alone, feeling isolated, emotionally very distressed, believing you were going to be attacked and acted as you did in that frame of mind.' 

Afterwards Walker, whose gun licence was revoked, said he had given up shooting as a sport and was keen to revive his previous past-time of ballroom room dancing.

He said: 'I have spent months convinced I was going to jail. The thought petrified me. At the time I fired that gun my life was all over the place.

I had lost my wife, got cancer and moved to a strange town to be near my family. But I accept I should never had fired the gun even though I was in fear for my life.'
