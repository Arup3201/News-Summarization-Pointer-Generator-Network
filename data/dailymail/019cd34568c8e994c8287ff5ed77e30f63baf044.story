A man and woman have both been charged over the death of a young man whose badly burnt body was found stuffed in a suitcase in a park.

The body of Dane McNeill, 20, was found by a council worker at Picnic Point in south-west Sydney shortly before 5.30am on July 21.

Mr McNeill, who was reported missing by his family three days before he was found, was so severely charred it was difficult to initially identify him and his age.

Detectives arrested a 24-year-old man  at a home at Bankstown about 8am on Wednesday. He has since been charged with murder and conspiracy to murder and was refused bail.

A 24-year-old woman was also arrested on Wednesday at a home at Liverpool just after 10am. She was charged late on Wednesday afternoon. 

The woman is believed to be pregnant and also has a two-year-old child, Daily Telegraph reports.  

A third man in custody for an unrelated matter is expected to be charged this month.

It is understood the pregnant woman is the girlfriend of one of her co-accused.

A woman,  24, was also arrested by police on Wednesday morning and was charged later that day

His family have spoken out about their heartbreak over the loss of Dane and their deep sadness that he 'fell into the wrong crowd' in the months before his death.

Every New Year's Eve, he made an effort hug to his mum when the clock struck 12.

It was the haunting absence of this routine show of affection a week ago that made the occasion almost too much to bear.

'Dane's mum really missed that. Come 12 o'clock and he wasn't there - it was hard,' father Peter McNeill told AAP.

On Wednesday, the Sydney family welcomed the bittersweet news that two people had been charged over their 20-year-old loved one's murder.  

Mr McNeill - an ice hockey star in his childhood - had lost his way with drugs six months before his death.

He had twice been busted for drugs and on one occasion was caught by police with ice and three knives in a suburban Sydney street.

When police searched his padlocked car on May 20 last year, they found digital scales, a black wallet with crystal meth-filled capsules and a drug tick book with names and dollar amounts. 

The Narellan man later pleaded guilty in court to a string of drug charges a month before his alleged murder.

If anything can come from his son's death, his father hopes it's a message about the impact of ice.

'I think it's really important the rest of the people out there realise the dangers of this drug,' he said.

'He was a good boy mixed up in ice. It was out of his control, basically.'

'He got mixed up in this ice epidemic... Guys, take it easy. You don't need it,' his father told Nine News.  

Police allege that Mr McNeill was assaulted at an address in Heckenberg on July 18 and kept captive overnight

The 24-year-old man has since been charged with murder and conspiracy to murder and was refused bail

Mr McNeill's family and girlfriend, Jade Patterson, are preparing themselves for the next milestone without him - his 21st birthday in March.

Ms Patterson hopes that now arrests have been made, Mr McNeill can 'now be at peace.

'He didn't deserve what they [allegedly] did to him,' she told SMH. 

'He was a beautiful boy with a heart of gold ... no matter what though, nothing will change what I'm feeling or bring Dane back.'
