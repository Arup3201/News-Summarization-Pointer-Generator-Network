A father has organised his own funeral, pre-booked a burial plot and made memory boxes for his young children because he has just months to live.

Andrew Hickie, 42, father to James, six, and Alexandra, four, has skin cancer which has spread around his body.

Yet the council worker, who is married to Victoria, 39, has vowed to remain optimistic and enjoy the limited time he has left.

He is also keen to raise awareness of the dangers of skin cancer.

Mr Hickie, from Kenton Bankfoot, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'The speed of the cancer progression has been devastating for me, my family, friends and colleagues.'

Skin cancer cases have soared seven-fold in the past 40 years.

The shock rise is blamed on the legacy of sunshine package holidays which became popular in the 1960s.

Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn in their youth, experts said this week.

And they warned the continuing obsession with sporting a tan will mean the toll keeps rising.

Sunbeds were singled out for criticism for fuelling the huge increase in all types of skin cancer, especially among young women.

New figures from Cancer Research UK show that more than 13,000 people a year develop malignant melanoma – the most deadly type of skin cancer.

The total is expected to surge to 20,000 a year by 2027. In 1975 the figure was just 1,800.

Malignant melanoma has become the fifth most common cancer in Britain, killing more than 2,000 people a year.

It is also the most common cancer in women in their 20s.

If caught early, it is treatable. If it spreads, even chemotherapy has little effect.

'I remain positive about the time ahead to try and prolong my life and will enjoy every day. My main sadness is the time I will miss with my family in time to come, something one takes for granted, like walking my daughter down the aisle or seeing my son become a man.'

Mr Hickie's nightmare began in August 2012 after an innocuous small blister tucked under a toe on his left foot turned out to be melanoma.

Medics removed the tumour and Mr Hickie lost two toes as a result of the surgery at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary.

He continued to get regular checkups 
and things were going well as 10 months later he was promoted to service
 director for economic and housing growth at Gateshead Council.

However,
 within the first week of starting his new role he found a lump on his 
groin and a subsequent CT scan revealed that the cancer had spread to 
his abdomen, right lung and some lymph nodes.

Mr
 Hickie had an operation to remove his left groin lymph glands and was 
recently told that the cancer had spread to his skull and soft tissue 
behind his left eye.

There is now no cure and he has lost 95 per cent vision in one eye.

Mr Hickie was part of a clinical trial
 at the Sir Bobby Robson Unit, but was removed from the programme as he 
was not responding to treatment.

He
 is currently undergoing intensive radiotherapy and hopes to receive the
 life-extending drug Ipilimubab with the aim of giving him a few 
precious extra years with his family.

Mr
 Hickie said: 'It is the hardest conversation you can ever have telling 
your children what's happening. There are two things that upset me the 
most.

Mr Hickie said telling his children was the hardest conversation and he is devastated that he won't be able to see them grow up past their 10th birthday. He's also been very moved by the kindness towards his family

Look out for new moles, freckles or patches of skin that have suddenly changed colour or size and get them checked by a doctor.

In particular pay attention to moles which are asymmetrical – the sides being different.

You should also get moles checked out by medics if they are wider than 6mm across, which is a quarter of an inch.

Moles which have jagged edges or show uneven colour should also be seen by a doctor, experts say.

Other signs include moles or spots which are itchy or bleed and sores that will not heal.

'The first is the children, as I won't be able to see them grow up and probably won't see them past their 10th birthday.

The second is the general human kindness that has been shown towards me and my family, as it has been a huge support.

'I'm able to handle my situation because I have a very positive mindset and I am determined to get through this without dwelling on things. I live each day as it comes.'

Over the last few weeks, he has been undertaking the heartbreaking tasks of sorting his will, organising his own funeral arrangements and making memory boxes for his children.

'It's going to be very difficult for my wife on her own and I want to put things together to make it as easy for her as possible,' he said.

He continues to look to the future and has a number of milestones that he wants to reach, including going to see his favourite football team Arsenal play in the FA Cup final at Wembley next month, celebrate his ninth wedding anniversary on May 28, and see his wife turn 40 on July 5.

He added: 'My family, friends, neighbours, work, children's school and medical staff have all been so supportive and have helped me immensely. I am so proud that I have been part of my children's formative years as it is really important to be there when they are a young age. To see how they've developed fills me with joy.'
