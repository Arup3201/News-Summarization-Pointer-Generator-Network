This is the comical letter that a schoolboy penned to his teacher after being told off for talking during a German lesson.

Rather than being apologetic and remorseful the defiant 13-year-old brazenly tells his language master, 'I am not sorry.'

In the hastily written note, scrawled on a scrunched up piece of lined paper, he says he was only speaking to a friend for a 'few seconds' was not 'constantly talking.'

The teen, who has not been named, added 'I do not like German' and signed off the letter with 'I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch.'

The hilarious letter was uploaded to Twitter by the boy's brother, and was retweeted thousands of times in just 12 hours.

The picture was uploaded with the caption 'My brother had to write an apology to Mrs *****. Look what he's put down.'

The boy is a pupil at Oldmachar Academy, in Aberdeen, Scotland.

The full note reads: 'I turned around and talked to ****** for a few seconds. I was not talking constantly. Also, everyone else was talking too and I got this work for speaking to ****** for a second.

'I don't think it's fair and I'm not sorry.. I already done the work. I do not enjoy German.

'I need to write to that line down there but I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch yesterday.'

The cheeky chap's father said: 'He does hate German. I had no idea that he had written this letter and this is all news to me.

'I turned around and talked to ****** for a few seconds. I was not talking constantly. Also, everyone else was talking too and I got this work for speaking to ****** for a second.

'I don't think it's fair and I'm not sorry.. I already done the work. I do not enjoy German.

'I need to write to that line down there but I have nothing else to say for myself so I'll just tell you I had chips for lunch yesterday.'

'I don't know if he would have had the guts to hand it in.' 

Twitter users found the letter hilarious, and it has so far received over 2,000 'favourites'.

One user wrote: 'At least Mrs ***** knows what he had for lunch. That's something anyway.'

Another added: 'This is sensational.'

Someone else wrote: 'That's brilliant.'

Other examples of hilarious letters written by children include one from a student which read: 'Dear Mrs Storz. You are the best music teacher ever because my last music teacher choked a boy.'

One letter from one pupil to another reads: 'Dear Brody. Miss P made me write you this note. All I want to say sorry for is not being sorry because

I tried to feel sorry but I don't.'

There was no one available at the school for comment.
