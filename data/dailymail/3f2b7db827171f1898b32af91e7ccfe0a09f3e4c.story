David Cameron spent thousands of pounds of public money on a 140-mile helicopter flight to Lincoln instead of taking a car or train.

The Prime Minister snubbed public transport and travelled by military aircraft to attend a question-and-answer session with factory workers.

Last night green campaigners said there was ‘no justification’ for using a helicopter for such a short journey.

David Cameron answers questions for workers at 
Siemens' factory in Lincoln: The Prime Minister spent thousands of 
pounds of taxpayers' money on a 140-mile helicopter flight there rather 
than going by car or train

Travelling in style: It is not known how much 
the RAF helicopter would have cost - but it is likely to have run into 
the tens of thousands. A similar train journey costs just £67 for standard class return ticket

It is believed that the flight by RAF helicopter was only a little more than an hour faster than taking a train.

On Tuesday, Mr Cameron was driven to 
RAF Northolt, near Uxbridge, West London, in his ministerial car, a 
journey of around 35 minutes.

He was then flown by military 
helicopter to RAF Waddington, near Lincoln – a flight of less than an 
hour – where he was met by another car to take the 13-minute journey to a
Siemens factory.

A similar train journey from London to
Lincoln, changing at Newark North Gate, takes around two hours and 
costs £67, or around £120 for a first-class ticket.

It is not known how much using the RAF helicopter would have cost, but it is likely to have been several thousand pounds.

Working dad: It has been speculated that the PM 
may have chosen to fly to Lincoln so that he was able to take his 
daughter Florence to nursery and help with the school run for his other 
children while his wife is away

Following the question-and-answer 
session, Mr Cameron was asked how he travelled to Lincoln, where 
travellers have long complained of poor rail links.

He said: ‘Today, I’ve been flying 
around, but I use trains, cars, boats, planes, helicopters – all manner 
of means. But I know here in Lincoln you want to see more direct 
services. There’s the one but we need more.’

'It's amazeballs': Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott used his Twitter account to mock Mr Cameron's choice of transport

Natalie Bennett, the leader of the 
Green Party, said: ‘Clearly, he should have taken a train for 
environmental reasons. It’s an immense sum of money.’

Steve McCabe, Labour MP for Birmingham
Selly Oak, said: ‘People stuck on trains and in traffic queues in the 
sweltering heat will be appalled to find out that David Cameron was 
spending thousands of pounds of their money on a helicopter to ferry him
to a publicity stunt.

'Once again it just shows just how out of touch 
the Tories are.’

Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister will use the most appropriate form of travel.’

Asked why an RAF helicopter was deemed
to be the most appropriate mode of transport on this occasion, he 
replied: ‘Because it was. I’m not a travel agent.

‘The Prime Minister travels in a range
of different means, of course dependent on the event he is going to. We
publish the costs of ministerial travel. Everything is as 
cost-effective as possible.’

Asked if he had travelled by helicopter to avoid sitting on a hot train, the spokesman said: ‘I didn’t have a thermometer.’

Former deputy prime minister John 
Prescott made fun of the flight on Twitter, despite the fact that he was
once flown by helicopter to a Grand Prix at Silverstone, paid for by 
the Motorsports Association.

Mr Prescott, who also took his 
chauffeur-driven car the short distance from a Bournemouth hotel to the 
Labour Party conference, tweeted a link to a train ticket website 
yesterday, saying: ‘David Cameron, you really should try this. It’s 
amazeballs.’
