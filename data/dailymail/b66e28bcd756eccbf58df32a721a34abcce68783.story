Retiring: Colin Skipp, who plays Tony Archer, with Patricia Gallimore as Pat Archer in 1999

He is the longest serving soap star in Britain, entertaining listeners with exploits as Tony Archer for more than four decades.

So Archers fans will be saddened to learn Colin Skipp is finally hanging up his muddy wellies. The actor, who started on the radio show in 1967, revealed yesterday that he is retiring to spend more time with his family after a series of heart attacks.

'I'm sorry to be leaving The Archers after more than 40 happy years in the programme. But sadly ill health has made it extremely difficult for me to continue playing Tony,' he said.

Mr Skipp has featured in many of the most memorable storylines in The Archers.

In the early days, his character was a mischievous lad, but he was tamed after marrying his wife Pat.

The relationship became difficult in the 1980s when she embraced politics and became involved in the women's movement but converting Bridge Farm to organic production unified them and saved the marriage.

Tony also faced tragedy, having to come to terms with his son John's death in a tractor accident in 1998, and health problems of his own, suffering a heart attack at 60.

While Mr Skipp is retiring, his character will remain, played by David Troughton, who has appeared in Doctor Who and Outnumbered.

Mr Skipp added: 'While at 60 years of age, Tony quickly recovered from his heart attack, I had more problems at 74 coping with several real-life heart attacks, resulting in major heart surgery.

'I shall miss my trips to Ambridge, working with a superb cast, directors, everyone in the office and studio - and my lovely radio family, Pat, Louiza and Tom.

'However, I'm looking forward to spending time with my own wife, daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter. I send best wishes to David Troughton, the new Tony, and hope the part will give him as much pleasure as it gave me.'

Mr Troughton, who starts on January 7, is coincidentally a cousin of Judy Bennett, who plays Tony Archer's cousin Shula Hebden Lloyd in the show.

He said: 'This came totally out of the blue but I was extremely pleased and privileged to be asked to take over such an important part in the longest running series in the world.

'I wish Colin all the best in his retirement and I'll do my very best to fill his muddy wellington boots.' Mr Skipp is the longest serving soap actor in Britain, even though Barbara Knox first appeared as Rita Tanner in Coronation Street three years before he joined The Archers.

She however, has not featured on her show continuously.

Sean O'Connor, editor of the Radio 4 series, said: 'We're so sorry to say goodbye to Colin Skipp, who has been at the core of The Archers family for so many years. He has created a vibrant, warm and iconic character. He'll be hugely missed by everybody working on the programme and, I'm sure, by listeners too.

'However, we're thrilled to welcome David Troughton to fill Colin's Wellies and very excited to see where he and the writers will take Tony and the Bridge Farm Archers in the future.'
