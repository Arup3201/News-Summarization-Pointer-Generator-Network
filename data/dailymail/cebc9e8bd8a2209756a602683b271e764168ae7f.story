Australia has been dubbed the dirtiest country in the developed world and the Saudi Arabia of the South Pacific.   

The claims were made in reference to the federal government's decision to repeal a carbon tax on the nation's worst greenhouse gas polluters in a US-based technology magazine, Future Tense.

The 1,700 word article, titled The Saudi Arabia of the South Pacific and published on Slate.com, reads like a comprehensive list of how Australia became the worst polluter in the world and lists things that are wrong with the country's climate policy.

An article for US-based technology magazine, Future Tense, lists reasons why Australia became the worst polluter in the world, including a now-repealed decision to dump dredge on the Great Barrier Reef

'Australians like to think of themselves as green. Their island country boasts some 3 million square miles of breathtaking landscape. They've had environmental regulations on the books since colonial times,' the article read.

'In 2007 they elected a party and a prime minister running on a 'pro-climate' platform, with promises to sign the Kyoto Protocol and pass sweeping environmental reforms.

'And yet, seven years later, Australia has thrown its environmentalism out the window - and into the landfill.'

Brisbane is set to host the G-20 economic summit in November and the article claims Australian leaders plan to use their powers as host of the event to keep climate change off the agenda.

Future Tense says Australia has thrown its environmentalism out the window and into the landfill, partly due to Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his government dismantling key environmental policies 

'Did we mention that Australians' per-capita carbon emissions are the highest of any major developed country in the world? Welcome to the Saudi Arabia of the South Pacific,' the article reads.

The authors also draw on the now-repealed-decision to dump coal mine dredge near the heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef and the government's plan to open up the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area to commercial logging. 

'Let's see, Australian leaders must wake up wondering every morning: 'What natural wonder could we trash today?',' they said.

'Beautiful as it is, it's a harsh land in which to make a home. It's often on fire, usually in drought, and when the streams aren't bone dry, they're flooding - all natural disasters that are already being exacerbated by global warming.

'Let's hope that the rapacious policies of the current government represent only a temporary bout of insanity.' 

The decision to axe the carbon, introduced by the former Labor government, was a key election promise made by Prime Minister Tony Abbott during the 2013 election campaign.

It was repealed in July - two years after it was introduced. 

Mr Abbott planned to replace the carbon tax with industry incentives to use cleaner energy.
