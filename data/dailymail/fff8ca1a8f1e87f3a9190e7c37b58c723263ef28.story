He was one of the greatest engineers of British history, designing and building 25 railway lines, over 100 bridges and three ships including the Great Western and Great Britain.

She is an award-winning mechanical engineer, a star graduate from the University of Bristol, and one of a few women in her field.

And now, Morwenna Wilson, the great-great granddaughter of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, has been charged with renovating the area around King's Cross station, built by Brunel's contemporaries in 1851-52.

Morwenna Wilson, 31, the great-great granddaughter of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, has been put in charge of a team of architects and engineers renovating the area around King's Cross Station

At just 31 years old, Ms Wilson will lead a team of architects and engineers tasked with giving a modern-day twist to the oldÂ  Victorian structures around the station and bringing them back to life.

Brunel was one of the greatest engineers of his time, building 25 railway lines and more than 100 bridges

Speaking about her ancestor to The Times, she said: 'He was an inspiration. It definitely runs in the family. My grandfather was also an engineer.'

Studying at the University of Bristol, she was perfectly placed to admire the brilliance of great-great grandfather.

In 1833 Brunel was commissioned to work on the Great Western Railway linking London to Bristol, and accomplished many engineering feats during its construction, including the viaducts at Hanwell and Chippenham, the Maidenhead Bridge, the Box Tunnel and Bristol Temple Meads Station.

Earlier, in 1931, his designs won a competition to build the Clifton Suspension Bridge across the River Avon which flows through the city.

While he was responsible for several architectural feats in London, such as Thames Tunnel from Rotherhithe to Wapping, he wasn't actually the genius behind King's Cross.

The station was in fact designed by his contemporary, George Turnbull, and later details were added by Lewis Cubitt.

Brunel would be proud to know that, 155 
years on from his death, his descendent is carrying on with the work he 
and his contemporaries started.

When the work on King's Cross is completed it will house more than 18 restaurants, 2,000 new homes, 23 office spaces and a collection of outdoor venues.

Women are woefully under-represented in the construction industry, making up just 11 per cent of the workforce, compared with 50 per cent in finance, 46 per cent of doctors and 27 per cent of police.

Among one of his most spectacular achievement is the Clifton Suspension Bridge over the River Avon

While most of his work was completed in the west of England, he designed bridges across the UK inlcuding this one across the River Dee in Balmoral, Scotland

It's something she is keen to change. She said: 'It's not just about being a builder on site. It's about celebrating practical achievements.

'One of the things I enjoy most about my job is that I am creating tangible things. I can show people and say "I was part of this."'

Another female engineer keen to engage women is Roma Agrawal, a 30-year-old structural engineer who worked on the Shard skyscraper in London and appeared as one of the inspirational women on the recent M&S poster campaign.

She said there was still an element of everyday sexism on building sites, but added: 'As the number of women on site is steadily increasing, it's only a matter of time before that gets stamped out.'

Brunel was a stand-out even in a field of greats, accomplishing a huge amount in a relatively short lifespan

Over the course of his relatively short life, from 1806 to 1859, Brunel was responsible for building over 25 railway lines, more than 100 bridges, eight piers and docks, and three enormous steamships.

He was a stand-out even in a field which included greats like George Stevenson - so-called father of the railways - and Thomas Cubitt - who helped build large parts of London, including Finsbury, Islington and Belgravia.

He constructed the Great Western Railway, linking London to Bristol, built the famous Bristol Meads Station, and designed five revolutionary suspension bridges including the Clifton Suspension Bridge over the River Avon.

While he is best known for his work on the railways, he was also an accomplished ship builder.

He built the the 'Great Western', which launched in 1837 and was the first steamship to ferry regular passenger journies across the Atlantic Ocean.

The 'Great Britain', launched in 1843, was the world's first iron-hulled, steam-powered passenger liner to use a screw-propellar, which made ti far more efficient.

The 'Great Eastern', launched in 1859, was designed in cooperation with John Scott Russell, and was by far the biggest ship ever built, but was so expensive it drove its owner into bankruptcy.
