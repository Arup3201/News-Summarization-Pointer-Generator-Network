Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan who was sacked by Myer this week after it was discovered he lied on his CV had previously lied his way into a job at the Australia Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry

The man who was fired from Myer on Monday after it was revealed that he had lied about his credentials was reported to police in January for doing the same thing to another company.

Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan was hired by the Australian Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry (AACCI) in December after he provided references and credentials that turned out to be false.

A spokesman for the chamber said he had used the name 'Jeffrey Flanagan' when he was hired.

The name he used for the job at Myer was 'Andrew Flanagan' - but the spokesman confirmed to the MailOnline : 'It is the same guy'.

'The references he had at the time sounded like great references, but when people looked into it further, they realised that things didn't add up, his claims didn't match what was on his resume,' he said.

The spokesperson said that Mr Flanagan provided the AACCI with different references to the ones he gave Myer and that they were 'more suited to our needs'.

'I'd say he's stupid and smart. He's playing the game, he tailored his resume, which everyone does, but he went way overboard with having the right references and obviously the references were bogus.'

The spokesperson did not know how Mr Flanagan was recruited for the role, which was a national one and would have seen him fly across the country, but added that the job had been advertised on Seek.

Mr Flanagan was hired in December 2013 but took a holiday immediately afterwards. He 'wasn't operational until early January, and was asked to resign in mid to late January.'

The AACCI then reported the whole incident to the police, the spokesman said.

Mr Flanagan also managed to dupe the Australia Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry, fooling them with a fake CV last December

Andrew Flanagan was fired from Myer on Monday on his first day as general manager of strategy and business development.

He claimed he had held the position of managing director and vice-president of Asia Pacific for Inditex, the Spanish company that owns popular fashion chain, Zara.

However, Inditex contacted Myer on Monday, just hours after Mr Flanagan started work at the company, to inform Myer that Mr Flanagan had never worked for them.

Mr Flanagan was interviewed by the recruitment company several times and transcripts of those interviews were sent to Myer. Quest also conducted reference checks, contacting local and overseas referees.

It is unclear how Mr Flanagan fooled Myer, Quest and the other companies interested in employing him.

The Australian Financial Review reported that Mr Flanagan appears to be from Searcy in Arkansas and now lives in Melbourne.

Myer hired Mr Flanagan as general manager of strategy and business development and he began working for the company on Monday, but was fired before the end of the day

Myer CEO Bernie Brooks was not the only one to be fooled, several other companies considered Mr Flanagan for roles at their companies on the basis of his falsified resume
