New face: Former CNN anchor Piers Morgan is joining MailOnline as Editor-at-Large (US)

MailOnline, the world’s biggest English language newspaper website, today announced that Piers Morgan has joined the website as Editor-at-Large (US). 

Piers, one of the best known journalistic faces on both sides of the Atlantic, joins MailOnline from CNN where he was host of Piers Morgan Live from 2011 until 2014.

He will write several times each week, bringing his own experience and perspective to bear on the big US stories of the moment.

He will continue contributing a weekly column to the Mail on Sunday newspaper and hosting Piers Morgan’s Life Stories on ITV in Britain.

He will also be pursuing new television ventures in the US.

Piers said of his appointment: ‘I am very excited to take on the role of Editor-at-Large (US) at MailOnline, which has become the most successful and dynamic platform in the world of news.

‘The site is an addictive pleasure, that offers an extraordinarily wide and diverse range of stories from all around the world. It’s become my first stop for news each morning and multiple times throughout the day – as it has for many others, which is why 180 million people now visit MailOnline every month, 60 million of them from here in America alone.

‘News should never be boring and MailOnline tells the stories of the day in a compelling, informative and entertaining way that grabs the interest of its readers. As Editor-at-Large (US) I plan on breaking down the biggest stories that matter to Americans and analyzing them in a way that will generate discussion and create debate.

‘Writing was my first love as a journalist and being able to write on such a powerful, far-reaching and ambitious global platform is an opportunity I couldn’t turn down.’

Martin Clarke, Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of MailOnline said: ‘Piers is a fantastic addition to MailOnline.

‘He has vast experience as an editor and presenter and certainly knows how to generate conversation and create debate so we’re delighted that he will be joining us as our first ever Editor-at-Large.’

Piers Morgan has had a successful and varied career. Starting at the Wimbledon News, he joined The Sun as a columnist in 1989.

In 1994, when he was just 28 years old, Rupert Murdoch appointed him Editor of The News of the World. He was its youngest ever Editor and the youngest national newspaper editor in Britain in over 50 years.

After two years at The News of the World he joined the Daily Mirror, where he was Editor-in-Chief from 1995 until 2004. In 2002 the paper won Newspaper of the Year at the British Press Awards for its coverage of the September 11 attacks on America.

After departing from the Mirror, Piers became a best-selling author, media columnist and host of his own interview shows on ITV and the BBC. He also appeared as a judge alongside his good friend Simon Cowell on Britain’s Got Talent.

In America he is most famous for hosting Piers Morgan Live on CNN from 2011 to 2014 and NBC's America’s Got Talent from 2006 until 2011. He also won NBC's Celebrity Apprentice in 2009.

Piers has been writing a column for the Mail on Sunday since 2004 and in 2009 he launched Piers Morgan’s Life Stories, which has consistently been the number one rated talk show in Britain for the past five years. He has also published a number of books.

Piers, who lives in Los Angeles and London, commences work with MailOnline immediately.
