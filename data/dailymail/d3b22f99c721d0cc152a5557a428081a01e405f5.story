According to the Seattle Times, this is the second train fatality on Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad property in Washington's King County this year.

The Las Vegas music community has paid tribute to the talented musician.

'Jersey Boys' music director Keith Thompson told the Las Vegas Sun that Ray was a particularly gifted jazz guitarist who could play any genre.

'We at "Jersey Boys" are in shock, total shock, about Jeff’s death,' Thompson said in a phone conversation today. 'He was a complete and total delight to work with and be around and was one of the most positive, upbeat, joyous people I’ve known in the business... He loved "Jersey Boys" and being part of this show.'

Ray previously lived in Harlem, New York and fronted a quintet called The Onus.
