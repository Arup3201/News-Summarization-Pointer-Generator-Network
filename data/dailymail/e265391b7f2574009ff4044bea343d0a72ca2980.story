Miner: Foreman Trevor Steeples was overcome by methane gas while 2,300ft underground at Daw Mill in June 2006

A judge today ordered Britain’s biggest mining firm to pay £1.2 million in fines and costs after he heard how four miners died following safety breaches in four separate incidents.

UK Coal admitted offences under health and safety laws in relation to the deaths of Trevor Steeples, Paul Hunt, Anthony Garrigan and Paul Milner.

Mr Steeples, Mr Hunt and Mr Garrigan died following incidents at Daw Mill colliery, near Coventry in 2006 and 2007.

Mr Milner died after an incident at the now-closed Welbeck Colliery, in Nottinghamshire, in 2007.

Mr Justice MacDuff said at Sheffield Crown Court he would not impose a penalty so high it would cripple a company suffering real financial problems.

He said UK Coal would be fined £112,500 in relation to each incident and would pay a further £187,500 in costs in each case.

But he urged the families of the dead men to focus on the total combined financial penalty for the firm.

The judge said: 'These were, of course, dreadful accidents. They were preventable accidents.

'However, unlike most criminal acts, there was no intention to kill or injure.

'But the law rightly demands a high duty of care by employers for the safety of their employees and other workers.

'Mining is and will remain a dangerous occupation. These accidents all occurred in the depths of the earth.'

'This is not easy work - neither in conception nor in execution. But safety is paramount in the modern world.

'Long gone are the days of 60 and more years ago, when men were allowed to die and suffer dreadful injury in pursuit of profits for coal owners.'

Prosecutor Rex Tedd told an earlier 
hearing that the miners were in the habit of riding the train rather 
than taking a long walk to the coal face but management did nothing to 
stop the practice.

He said: 'The practice continued 
because there was no practical alternative given the gruelling nature of
the journey which otherwise had to be done on foot.'

The judge today told the court: 'In each
of the cases the death would have been prevented if proper safe systems
of working had been in place - and if those systems had been enforced.'

But he added: 'I am not sure that that is entirely true in respect of the death of Mr Steeples. In his case the major cause of death was dereliction of duty by a number of his colleagues who, unbeknown to senior management, unaccountably, and probably unforeseeably, failed in their duties.'

Paul Hunt, 45, a contractor, of Swadlingcote, Derbyshire died after falling off an underground train at Daw Mill.

He was riding on the leading car facing backwards as it reached the surface following the one-in-four climb.

The driver nearly stalled the train then put on speed which jolted the cars throwing off Mr Hunt.

'He was dislodged and fell to the track and was struck by the train with tragic results,' said Rex Tedd, prosecuting.

Trevor Steeples, 46, a foreman, was overcome by methane gas while 2,300ft underground at Daw Mill in June, 2006.

Anthony Garrigan, 42, of Thorne, near Doncaster was killed at Daw Mill when he was trapped under a 100-tonne rock fall.

Changes had been made to the roof of a tunnel and short support bolts used which put stress on the sides.

Previous rock falls had been reported but the information was not passed to the Mining Inspectorate until the tragedy.

Two months before his death, a miner received deep cuts to his arm as he leaped clear of a fall.

Mr Garrigan, a contractor, was due to operate a bulldozer but it was under repair so he was switched to a three-man team.

The others were drilling when the rock fell and buried him. despite 'exceptional' rescue efforts he died.

A fourth miner Paul Milner, 44, was fatally injured at Welbeck Colliery when a shaft gave way trapping him under a rock.

Production on the seam had stopped and a salvaging operation was taking place after a new code of practice had been drawn up.

Mr Tedd said the code, which provided for temporary roof supports, was 'ignored' on site.

The judge said he had a difficult task as UK Coal was suffering financially and had seen its share price fall from £5 to 29p in the time since the accidents.

He also said the firm had made a 'massive investment in safety measures' since new senior management took over.

He said there had been an enormous improvement in the defendant’s safety record.

The judge said: 'Coal mining used to be a part of the fabric of our society - particularly here in South Yorkshire.

'In spite of the privatisation of the mines and the closure of so many of them in recent years, coal is still needed.

'UK Coal is an important contributor to the economy of the United Kingdom.

'Coal mined within the defendant’s mines makes a significant contribution to the generation of the nation’s electricity.'

He
said the company was 'trading on the edge of viability'.

He said: 'It 
would be in no one’s interest if the company ceased to trade or if it 
had to reduce further the scope of its operations.'

Anne
Steeples the mother of Trevor Steeples said after the hearing:

'Our 
family are relieved that UK Coal has been fined over the tragic deaths 
of four men but are bitterly disappointed at the outcome of the trial 
regarding Trevor’s death.

'Somebody was to blame. We know who they are and they will have to live with this knowledge for the rest of their lives.'

During
sentencing the judge remarked that the cause of Mr Steeples’ death was 
'dereliction of duty' by a 'number of his colleagues who unbeknown to 
senior management unaccountably and probably unforseeably failed in 
their duties.

'One of those fellow workmen made false recordings of oxygen and methane levels upon which reliance was placed.

'These dishonestly recorded that he had taken readings when he had not.

'I
know that he lost his job as a consequence. Another fellow workman a 
ventilation officer who had all the approriate training and 
qualifications negligently authorised the use of of a fan which far from
improving matters was in fact positioned so as to prevent the 
circulation of fresh air.

'This was a major contributor to the asphyxiating conditions in which the the unfortunate Mr Steeles found himself.'

In respect of the other three deaths the judge said risk were taken, codes of practice not enforced and safe systems of working were either 'not in place or were not followed',

Bob Leeming, HM Inspector of Mines said afterwards: 'We are concerned about safety in pits.

'Over the last five-and-a-half years there have been 16 fatalities whereas before Trevor’s death there was only one in five years.

'The series of fatal accidents we have had have caused us great concern and we are putting pressure on the industry to reverse that trend.
