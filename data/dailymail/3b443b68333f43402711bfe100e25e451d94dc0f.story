The people of the East Midlands are officially the fattest in Britain with more hospital admissions for obesity-related illnesses than anywhere else in the country.

The city of Derby has the highest proportion of residents needing weight reduction surgery - such as gastric bands and stomach-stapling.

Official figures revealed 80 people in every 100,000 go under the knife in a drastic effort to cut their weight.

Meanwhile, the Nottinghamshire district of Bassetlaw has the most obesity-linked hospital admissions.

An incredible 2,878 per 100,000 people in the town, as well as nearby Worksop and Retford, were admitted for health problems arising from extreme weight.

The figure was almost six times the national average of 502 hospital admissions per 100,000 people for obesity-related illnesses.

A record 729 people are being treated in hospital every day because they are overweight, according to figures published by the NHS Information Centre.

In the last three years the annual total has doubled to 266,666 people - up from just 23,777 10 years ago.

Last year 173,803 of the people admitted to hospital were women, compared with just 92,828 men, the data revealed.

In contrast, Bournemouth and Poole has 
the lowest rate of hospital admissions among the overweight - with just 
173 per 100,000 admitted to hospital last year.

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National 
Obesity Forum and Chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, said the 
statistics were not surprising, because the Government had failed to get
to grips with Britain's weight problem.

'The figures are totally shocking but
it is not surprising in any way. We have been trying to cope with 
obesity in the last 15 years but we have done nothing but stand and 
watch the rates go up and up,' he said.

'Although the Government is trying to tell us the figures are evening off, in inner cities where there is deprivation it is getting worse. There it is more difficult and expensive to find healthy food so people don't.

'There is also a great fall off in people taking physical activity - all these things put people in danger of obesity.

'The Government would have you believe it is on track to stop obesity. But in one famous example they said in 2004 they would stop obesity in children by 2010 - then two years later they had to admit it was impossible.'
