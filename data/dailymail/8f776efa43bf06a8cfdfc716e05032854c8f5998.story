When most people hear the phrase 'smoking rock', they would probably immediately think of the scourge of crack cocaine, the glassy appearance of the drug crystal meth, or perhaps red-hot lava.

Their first impression is unlikely to be of a Chinese piece of stone that can, according to its proud owner, inhale a cigarette in under five minutes.

Mystery surrounds the nicotine-addicted rock, which was put on show by collector Luo Yuanshui, from Longyan in southeast China's Fujian Province.

Astonishingly, this Chinese rock can smoke a cigarette in under five minutes, according to its rock collector owner

Cigarettes, with variations for length and brand, take around six minutes to burn down naturally if left unsmoked.

Mr Luo says his puffing pebble knocks an incredible minute off that time, somehow.

One of the pictures shows a male and female staring at the rock in utter amazement.

He said he found the 2.2kg rock in the mountains of Shangyou. Naturally, his first instinct was to find a hole and pop one of his cigarettes in to see if it would smoke it.

He was amazed to discover it did.

The oddity is an unidentified red-coloured rock and is fitted with an instructional plaque and a handy ashtray so the marble-boro can neatly indulge in its vice.

The mystery of nature: Luo demonstrates the incredible process to two enthralled, gaping onlookers
