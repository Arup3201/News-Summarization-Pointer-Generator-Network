A Mauritania court has condemned a man to be shot to death for insulting the Islamic prophet of Mohammad, a human rights group claims. 

Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir, 28, was arrested a year ago for writing an article about the Prophet Mohammad and the caste system, an extremely sensitive subject in a country with deep social and racial divisions.

It comes as the country's president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz continues to deny the practice of slavery still exists, despite widespread evidence of it and other human rights abuses occurring within the West African nation.

The prosecution asked for the death penalty to be carried out in accordance with Islamic sharia law and recommended he be shot. 

He claims his article has been misinterpreted and was reported to have fainted in court when the verdict was handed down.

Mauritania, a poor country straddling Arab and black Africa, last applied the death penalty in 1987. 

Separately, a court in the southern town of Rosso began proceedings on Wednesday against anti-slavery campaigner Biram Ould Dah Ould Abeiday and six members of his organisation for 'inciting violence, disrupting public order, contempt for authorities and membership of a non-recognised organisation'.

Mauritania became the last country worldwide to legally abolish slavery in 1981 and still has the highest prevalence worldwide of slavery per head of population, according to the Global Slavery Index 2013. 

Perceived slights against the Prophet have a history of causing offence among Muslim populations, and can carry with them harsh and brutal punishments.

British writer Salman Rushdie's 1988 book The Satanic Verses caused such anger among some Muslim populations a fatwa calling for his death was issued by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

The outrage and widespread chaos over the book has lasted 25 years. Here Pakistani Muslims are pictured protesting against Salman Rushdie and Britain in 2007. Five years later, the bounty was raised

It led to several failed attempts to assassinate Rushdie and forced the award-winning writer into hiding.

Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese translator, was stabbed to death in the face at work, a Norwegian publisher shot and an Italian publisher knifed.

In late 2005 and early 2006, protests were across the globe in outrage over a series of cartoons in a Danish newspaper depicting the Prophet.

Several Western embassies were attacked and people killed in demonstrations which turned violent, while plots to attack or even kill editor Flemming Rose and cartoonist Kurt Westergaard were subsequently unearthed.
