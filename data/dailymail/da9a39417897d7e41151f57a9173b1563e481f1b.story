A teenager nicknamed 'Baldy' by bullies was left with unsightly bald patches at the back of her head, the result of a compelling but rare disorder.

May Brown, from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk began pulling her own hair out at the age of 11.

By the time she was 16 she had several bald patches on the top of her head.

For years, the now 17-year-old tried to hide her disorder.

She endured cruel taunts and bullying from classmates - who tugged at her hair and called her 'Baldy'. 

She is now speaking out to raise awareness of the rare condition trichotillomania, which compels her to tear out her hair.  

May Brown, 17, was left bald at the top of her head due to suffering trichotillomania, which caused her to pull out her own hair compulsively

She began pulling out her hair at age 11. By the age of 16 she had a bald patches on her crown (pictured left and right) and was taunted by bullies that called her 'Baldy'

She hid her condition from everyone but her family for years, hiding her bald patches with hairclips, different hairstyles and hats

The rare disorder causes people to pull their hair out from their heads, as well as from their eyebrows and eyelashes.

May, a student who documented her struggle in a YouTube video, said: 'I've had enough of keeping my trichotillomania a secret for so many years and felt it was time to come clean.

'At school, I was teased for my bald patches and was an easy target for bullies. I hope speaking out raises more awareness about the condition so that others 'trichers' don't suffer in silence.'

May's symptoms first became apparent when she was just 9-years-old and began pulling her eyebrow hair out.

She said: 'I was watching TV one day and was constantly pulling my eyebrow hair out, not realizing what the outcome would turn out like.

'When I later looked in the mirror, I had actually pulled so much out that I had no eyebrows left.'

May's trichotillomania briefly stopped until she started secondary school, when she began tearing hair from her scalp.

She said: 'I somehow stopped pulling up until I was 11-years-old and then began to tear hair from my head.

Trichotillomania is a condition where a person feels compelled to pull their hair out.

They may pull out the hair on their head or in other places, such as their eyebrows or eyelashes.

Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a psychological condition where you are unable to stop yourself carrying out a particular action.

It is not known what causes trichotillomania but there are several theories.

Some experts think hair pulling is a type of addiction. The more you pull your hair out, the more you want to keep doing it.

Trichotillomania may be a reflection of a mental health problem. Psychological and behavioural theories suggest that hair pulling may be a way of relieving stress or anxiety.

In some cases, trichotillomania may be a form of self-harm, where you deliberately injure yourself as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress.

The most effective treatment is therapy to change your hair-pulling behaviour, combined with a network of emotional support.

Visit your GP if you are pulling your hair out or if you notice that your child is.

'I used to pull during school lessons - classmates would snigger and make comments.

'Because of this, I somehow stopped myself from pulling my hair in public to not bring attention to myself.

'But I would still pull in private so that within a couple of years, I had no hair left on the top of my head.

'Anything can set my trichotillomania off - from a school essay I'm stressed about it or if I over-think during a sleepless night. A lot of the time I don't even realise I'm pulling.'

The state of her hair made her an easy target for school bullies.

She said: 'I was called 'Baldy' by classmates. I had many comments from bullies like "Haircut go wrong?" or sarcastic remarks such as "I really like your hair".

'I remember one point a bully tugged my hair so that they could fully see my bald patch and have the chance to mock me.'

May attempted to conceal her bald patches with different hair accessories and styles.

She said: 'I would wear hearbands, hair slides and hats to hide my baldness.

'I remember I used to get told off in school for always wearing the same hat. Some of my teachers were fed up with me for wearing it so much.'

Until this year, May was too embarrassed to reveal her condition to her friends and family. It was only her sister and parents who were aware of her trichotillomania.

But in January, the Youtube blogger - who runs the channel MayBrown21 - decided to upload a video in which she confessed to the world.

The inspiring teen said: 'I decided to make a YouTube video explaining that I have trichotillomania as I wanted to tell my secret to everybody I knew.

'It was sort of a New Year's Resolution to not hide in silence anymore.

She chronicled her experiences on Youtube. In January, she released a video on Youtube confessing to having the condition. She says she has received messages of support since

'Since uploading the video, I have had so much support from everyone. I'm always receiving messages from other sufferers around the world asking for advice and telling me their Trich stories,' she said

'Even though it was literally the hardest thing I had ever done, I thought it would be much easier to upload one video than tell people face-to-face.

'But since uploading the video, I have had so much support from everyone. I'm always receiving messages from other sufferers around the world asking for advice and telling me their trich stories.'

A spokesman for Trichotillomania Support, a resource for people with the disorder, said: 'Trichotillomania can often affect shy people who are afraid or nervous to ask for help.

'It is important that sufferers know they are not alone and they should not be ashamed of asking for support.

'Any individual with the condition can call the Trichotillomania Support helpline.

'Athough it is often only in exceptional cases that people are able to stop pulling their hair altogether, there are ways in which you can learn to manage your Trichotillomania.'
