Princess Diana's car stole the show as it went on display at a festival intended to celebrate the most ordinary of cars.

Bringing something certainly extraordinary to the exhibition, the dark red Austin Mini Metro L was photographed many times while the teenager was dating Prince Charles in the early 1980s.

And the car was centre of attention once again at the first ever Festival of the Unexceptional.

Perhaps the Princess's first motor, which she drove as 19-year-old Lady Diana Spencer until she sold it in June 1981, the Mini was affectionately known as her 'courting car'.

At the time Diana worked as a nanny at the Young England kindergarten in Pimlico, and lived in a flat in Earl's Court, west London.

It has had three owners since it left the Royal fleet, and has clocked-up a very modest 30,000 miles. It now belongs to the Coventry Transport Museum.

Now rarely seen on British roads, the retro 
1980 model is one of the first Austin Mini Metros, designed to be a
 slightly bigger alternative to the classic Mini.

The car show held near Silverstone celebrated the best examples of the most ordinary cars of late 1960s to mid-1980s Britain.

Organisers,
 Hagerty Insurance, said: 'Let's celebrate, preserve and enjoy these 
threatened and endangered pieces of our beige, brown and plaid 
automotive heritage.

'There are twice as many Ferraris on the road in the UK than Austin Allegros!

'We've
 brought together the 50 best examples of a wide range of models - an 
award of dubious value will go to the overall winner.'
