This tiny scrap of land may be the smallest park in Britain - if not the in the world.

The Councillor Gerald Lee Park, in Darlington, County Durham, is a tiny patch of private land measuring 450 square feet.

The park, which is named after the town’s new mayor, is nestled beneath an advertising billboard.

It was created when a group of residents in Darlington decided to turn the site into an ‘environmentally aware space’ featuring plants, free drainage and a recycled bench.

The Councillor Gerald Lee Park will soon be pitted against Prince’s Park in Burntwood, Staffordshire, in a bid to be named Britain’s Smallest Park.

There is currently an ongoing debate between residents of Burntwood and Portland in Oregan over which park is the smallest in the world.

The park in America, which is two-feet in diameter with soil and some vegetation, has the backing of the Guinness Book of World Records.

The one in Burntwood is just 15 feet by 30 feet, but they are disputing whether Portland’s is a park at all due to its minuscule size.

Residents in Darlington wanted to put the tiny park on the map, and now it could stand a chance to win the accolade of Britain's smallest park

Paul Harman, Labour Councillor for Darlington, said: ‘The idea to do this started as a joke.

‘Councillor Gerald Lee decided to go forward with this because it will put the area on the map.

‘It means something very important indeed.

‘Little pieces of land like this owned by the council costs an enormous amount to maintain and what this will do is encourage local people to look after them and love them.

‘It is about the people in our area being positive and taking control.

‘Any rivalry in becoming the smallest park in Britain, and maybe even the world, will encourage people to love where they live and this is great.’

The park, at the corner of South Feethams and Victoria Embankment, has been created by members of the South Terrace Residents Association in conjunction with Guerilla Gardeners Darlington Division.

The project was also backed by fellow resident and local Labour councillor Paul Harman, who suggested naming the park after Conservative councillor Gerald Lee in recognition of his contribution to environmental issues in Darlington.

Councillor Lee said: ‘It is a lovely idea and it is great to see people taking ownership of little green spaces for the benefit of the community.’
