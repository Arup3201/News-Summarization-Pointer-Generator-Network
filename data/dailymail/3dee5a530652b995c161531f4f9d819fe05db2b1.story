John Lennon's killer, Mark Chapman is up for parole for the seventh time and could have his hearing as early as Tuesday.

The 57-year-old inmate Wende Correctional Facility is scheduled to be interviewed by members of the parole board this week.

New York Department of Corrections member Linda Foglia has said that the board would make a decision on whether to release Lennon's murderer by Friday.

Chapman shot Lennon in December 1980 outside the Manhattan apartment building where the 40-year old former Beatle lived.

He was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.

Chapman was transferred in May from the Attica Correctional Facility in western New York to the nearby Wende Correctional Facility.

Both are maximum security. The prison system doesn't disclose why inmates are transferred.

Chapman was denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008.

He was last up for parole in 2010, but this was denied because his 'discretionary release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community,' said the New York State Division of Parole.

Chapman is currently being held in protective custody in a single-person cell and is allowed out for three hours each day.

Following his transfer from Attica, Chapman applied to participate in a program called 'family reunion' which allows incarcerated inmates to spend more time with their family members.

On his application for parole in 2010, Chapman said that he killed the much-loved musician because he wanted 'instant notoriety.'

'I made a horrible decision to end another human being's life, for reasons of selfishness, and that was my decision at that time,' said Mark David Chapman in 2010.

'I felt that by killing John Lennon I would become somebody, and instead of that I became a murderer and murderers are not somebodies.'

Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, in previous years has submitted a letter requesting that parole be denied. Her attorney reiterated her position in an email toÂ CNN Saturday.
