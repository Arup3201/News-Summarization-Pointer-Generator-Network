One of England's most gifted ever players has made a spectacular return to football, after it emerged Paul Gascoigne has agreed to join Bournemouth Sunday League outfit Abbey according to the Bournemouth Echo.

The 47-year-old, who last played professionally for Boston United in 2004, informed Abbey manager Chris Foster of his decision during a chat at his apartment in Sandbanks a couple of weeks ago, with the latter expressing his delight at signing the former England star for his Division Four side.

He said: 'I have picked him up a few times and spoken to him about signing for us. Although he laughed it off, he didn't say no.

'I dropped him off at his flat a couple of weeks ago and he asked me to go to the shop to get him some cigarettes. When I got back, I was invited in and we had a good chat about various things.

'I gave him the cigarettes and pulled out the signing-on form at the same time. He signed it there and then. I was chuffed to bits and ran to the car as fast as I could. I was skipping like a 14-year-old!

'I texted some of the other lads and told them I had a real scoop of a signing. They thought it was either Taffy Richardson or Tommy Killick.'

Gazza has played at some of the biggest stadiums in the world after spells with the likes of Scottish giants Rangers and Newcastle, but his much-anticipated debut for Abbey could come in somewhat contrasting surroundings as their first two league games take place at Branksome Rec and Somerford Rec.

When asked about whether Gascoigne faced a fight on his hands to earn a place in Abbey's starting line-up Foster added: 'If he feels he is fit enough to play, he can play wherever he likes – at that includes in goal!

'I have said I will put a fixture sheet through his door and have offered to pick him up whenever he is willing to come. I don't know what his availability will be.

'My ambition is to get him there for every game. He might play every game or he might play one. It would be an honour to have him involved.'
