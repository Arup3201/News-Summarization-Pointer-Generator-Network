Videos that apparently show prisoners being repeatedly kicked and punched have sparked mass street protests in Georgia after they were aired on television.

Hundreds of protesters blocked traffic 
in the centre of Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, overnight after two government opposition television stations aired the graphic videos.

They appear to show guards brutally abusing 
prisoners and even raping them with
police truncheons and broom handles.

kicked and punched have sparked mass street protests in Georgia

Horrific: In the video guards appear to be brutally abusing prisoners and even raping them with police truncheons and broom handles

Parts of the video show a half-naked man pleading for mercy while other prisoners are forced to line up and await their own beating.

At one point, an inmate is reported to have said: 'Please don't film this, I'll do anything.'

The prison abuse videos were broadcast 
by Maestro and Channel 9 television stations, which said they received the 
footage filmed this year from a former prison official, who is currently
abroad.

The official, Vladimir Bedukadze, told 
Channel 9 that the guards abused 
prisoners on direct orders from the nation's interior minister. 
Bedukadze didn't offer any proof for his claims.

The public outrage over the horrific images has led to harsh accusations between the government and the opposition over the state of the prison service ahead of parliamentary elections. 

A cabinet minister in charge of the 
country's penitentiary system has been forced to step down while prosecutors revealed 12 prison officials have been arrested over the allegations.

Anger: Georgia's prisons minister was forced to resign today over videos showing the alleged beating and raping of convicts

Georgia President Mikheil Saakashvili, whose party is facing a tough opposition challenge in the upcoming parliamentary elections, quickly pledged to punish all the culprits and completely reshuffle prison personnel.

He said: 'Everyone who has masterminded it, everyone who has perpetrated it, everyone who has done it and allowed it to happen deserves the strictest - I repeat, the strictest - punishment.'

The president later discussed the incident with top government officials, saying that hundreds of prison guards in all Georgian prisons would be temporarily suspended pending an official probe and immediately replaced by police officers.

He said the nation's penitentiaries have suffered a 'systemic failure'. 

Public outrage: The protest in Tbilisi continued throughout last night and today as public anger mounted over the footage

Distressing: Many were left in tears and speechless after the brutal and shocking footage was aired

Scandal: The prison videos come just days before the parliamentary elections

Channel 9 that the guards abused 
prisoners on direct orders from the nation's interior minister

But the Interior Ministry today blamed Saakashvili's political foes for staging the videos - claiming prison officials were paid for orchestrating and filming the abuse by an inmate with connections to opposition leader Bidzina Ivanishvili.

Ivanishvili, Georgia's richest man and the head of the leading opposition party Georgian Dream, rejected the Interior Ministry claims. 

Ivanishvili, who owns Channel 9, and his supporters have 
faced an array of legal actions by authorities clearly concerned about 
his party gaining ground in polls in recent months.

The multibillionaire
said the prison video confirmed his longtime suspicions, stating: 'I knew very 
well that we had such violent authorities.'

Saakashvili, who has led Georgia since 2004, has remained popular thanks to his economic reforms, anti-corruption efforts and moves to integrate closer into the West.

The opposition has also accused Saakashvili of a systematic clampdown on dissent and independent media.
