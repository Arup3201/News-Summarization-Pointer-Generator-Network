Heavy fighting erupted in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk today as rebels were accused of jeopardising a fragile, nine-day-old truce between the government and separatist fighters.

Large clouds of thick black smoke could be seen billowing over the  city as sustained shelling and automatic gunfire rang out throughout the day.

There have been reports of a number of civilian casualties as Donetsk council described the situation in the city as 'critical' and as peace plans came under yet more pressure.

The Ukraine government accused the rebels of jeopardising the truce by intensifying their attacks on government positions in eastern parts of the country, the scene of five months of deadly combat.

Sunday's fighting appeared to be concentrated near Donetsk airport where the Ukrainian military said it had driven back an assault by insurgent fighters on Friday.

Journalists from Agence France-Presse were forced to duck for cover on the roof of a building near the airport when they became caught up in the gunfire.

'The terrorist actions are threatening the realisation of the Ukrainian president's peace plan,' said security spokesman Volodymyr Polyovy.

He also hit out at comments by two rebel leaders who both signed the 12-point truce deal in Minsk on September 5, but who declared on Sunday they were mere 'observers' at the talks.

The fighting broke out amid efforts to draw up a longer term peace deal to end a conflict that has cost more than 2,700 lives and set off the worst crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War

The ceasefire is seen as a first step in efforts to draw up a longer term peace deal to end a conflict that has cost more than 2,700 lives and set off the worst crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War.

President Petro Poroshenko has pledged to offer the eastern regions some limited self-rule, although the separatists say they want nothing less than full independence.

Rebels and government forces also swapped dozens of captives on Sunday in the latest exchange agreed under the accord.

But the insurgents said Kiev's forces were still firing at them.

'From our side, nobody is shooting but they are breaking the rules, everybody in the world knows it,' said a rebel commander defending a checkpoint near a village south of Donetsk.

NATO and Kiev say at least 1,000 Russian soldiers and possibly many more remain on Ukrainian soil although the Kremlin denies this.

Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk accused Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday of seeking to 'eliminate' Ukraine as an independent country with the goal of resurrecting the Soviet Union. 

Poroshenko heads to Washington this week to meet President Barack Obama, seeking to secure a 'special status' with the United States.

Obama has rejected direct military involvement but has unveiled tougher economic sanctions on Moscow.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Washington of trying to use the crisis to 'break economic ties between the EU and Russia'. 

On Saturday, Russia sent a 220-truck convoy it said was carrying aid to the residents of rebel-held Lugansk, who have been struggling without water and power for weeks.

Ukraine - which did not give permission for the convoy to cross - had expressed fears the trucks may be carrying supplies for insurgents and bitterly protested a similar delivery last month.
