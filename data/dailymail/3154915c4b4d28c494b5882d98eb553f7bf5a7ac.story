From the outside it looks like the grim skeletal remains of a once magical castle, but in fact this deserted Chinese replica of Disneyland never opened its doors.

What was meant to be ‘the largest amusement park in Asia’, had construction cut short over a decade ago after funding was withdrawn.

And now the ruins of ‘Wonderland’ sit in the middle of a 100-acre corn field, just a 45 minute drive from the centre of Beijing.

Work on the potential tourist haven started in 1998 but was halted due to disagreements over property prices with farmers and the local government.

Now the farmers that used to own the land have returned to grow their crops once again, with the decaying building site filling the skyline.

Photographer David Gray visited the magical kingdom-turned-ghost park and said: ‘Pulling off the express-way and into the car park, I expected to be stopped by the usual confrontational security guards.

‘But there was absolutely no one to be 
seen. I walked through one of the few entrances not boarded up, and 
instantly started coughing.

‘In front of me were large empty rooms and discarded furniture, all covered in a thick layer of dust, along with an eerie silence that gave the place a haunted feeling – an emotion not normally associated with a children’s playground.’

Local farmers told the photographer that they have returned to use the land because they say its safe to think the developers are never coming back.

‘This I can believe’, added Gray on his blog, ‘As the absence of any security (something very rare in China) leads one to think that even the developers have given up on what is already there.

‘All these structures of rusting steel and decaying cement, are another sad example of property development in China involving wasted money, wasted resources and the uprooting of farmers and their families.

‘It is a reflection of the country’s property market which many analysts say the government must keep tightening steps in place.

‘The worry is a massive increase in inflation and a speculative bubble that might burst, considering that property sales contribute to around 10 per cent of China’s growth’, Gray continued.
