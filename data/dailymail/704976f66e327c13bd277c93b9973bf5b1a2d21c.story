Dinyal New, mother of Lamar Broussard mourns his loss on Jan. 20, 2014. Her younger son Lee Weathersby was killed on New Year's Day

A mother in Oakland has lost both her sons to gun violence within a space of three weeks.

Dinyal New’s oldest son, 19-year-old Lamar Broussard, was shot and killed on Sunday, near the intersection of 100th Avenue and Longfellow in East Oakland, California.

The Laney College student, who aspired to be a musician, was ambushed and killed along with his best friend Derrick Harris while riding in a car.

However, her youngest son, 13-year-old Lee Weathersby, was gunned down on New Year’s Day, on 104th Avenue near Walnut Street, less than a mile away. He had been walking home from the Oakland Boys & Girls Club.

The 41-year-old social worker’s assistant, told SFGate that she was struggling with her faith in God.‘I have no more kids,’ she said. ‘I’m still numb about Lee, so I don’t know if my heart has enough room to handle Lamar’s death. This is like a dream right now.

‘I know there is a God, but I’m like, “Why would he give a mother so much pain to handle within 19 days?” This is really had one me.’

Ms New appealed for anyone to come forward with information about both deaths, and has pleaded with the community to not seek retribution. She said she was unaware if the shootings were related but added that no one outside the family knew Lee and Lamar were related.

‘Somebody’s failing these kids,’ she added. ‘They feel like it’s ok to murder these kids. They have no remorse or understanding afterwards.’

Lee Weathersby Jr, Lee’s father and Lamar’s stepfather, paid tribute to his sons, saying: ‘They were good boys, both of them.’

He added: ‘We’re not supposed to be burying our children. It’s supposed to be the other way round.’Tameka Rothchild, Mr Harris’s mother, told NBC Bay Area: ‘I love my son, and unfortunately people out here are heartless.

‘They don’t have no morals. They don’t have no type of values. They don’t care about a human being.’Oakland police have not identified any suspects in either shooting.
