While parts of the country bathed in brilliant sunshine yesterday, sections of Essex and south London were under water following torrential flooding.

Properties in Canvey Island were affected, while roads were blocked by flood water in Southend, Rayleigh, Castle Point, Wickford and Ramsden Heath.

Essex Police urged motorists to avoid unnecessary journeys and drive with caution.

The Environment Agency issued a flood 
warning, meaning flooding is expected, for the River Roach, Prittle 
Brook and Eastwood Brook in Southend.

Meanwhile,
 the Lambeth Country Show at Brockwell Park in Brixton, south London, 
was abandoned after torrential rain. 

Organisers said: 'Sadly, we 
have had to close the event. We thank you for coming this weekend but 
ask could you leave the park in a sensible manner.'

However,
 temperatures are likely to soar again this week, with the mercury 
possibly topping 30C (86F) for a three-day spell from Wednesday.

But the hot and humid weather could spark more thundery downpours.

The stormy weather caused travel disruption at London's Heathrow Airport as airlines were forced to cancel 20 per cent of flights for a two-hour period.

Up to 1.2in (3cm) an hour fell in some places - more than the average monthly rainfall for the whole of July.

Meanwhile Westonbirt in Gloucestershire experienced 3.1in (7.9cm) overnight on Friday and through Saturday.

Weather warnings remained in place yesterday, with the Met Office issuing a yellow 'be alert' notice for rain in eastern England and Scotland.

Alert: The Met Office has issued a 'yellow' warning of rain for eastern England and Scotland yesterday

It has forecasted thundery showers with torrential rain, lightning, hail and strong gusts. Central and western areas are largely dry and clear.

The wet weekend has also prompted flood warnings from the Environment Agency, which had yesterday morning issued 37 flood alerts.

While temperatures will be high in the UK this week, they are unlikely to beat Friday’s year-high of 32.3C (90F) recorded in Gravesend, Kent.

Gemma Prebble, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said the worst of the bad weather is over.

Ms Prebble said it is likely to be very warm for all of next week, saying: ‘By Tuesday there will be highs of 28C (82.4F) in the South East.

‘And on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday it will possibly be up to 30C (86F) in the South East.’

The heat is again likely to bring with it the risk of heavy showers and thunder storms, especially in the South, on Wednesday and Thursday.

The warm spell is likely to stretch on into the following week, but some families will be preoccupied with recovering from the impact of Saturday's storms.

A family of four were forced out of their home after their semi-detached bungalow in Holland on Sea in Essex was struck by lightning.

The roof of another property in Chelmsford collapsed after it was hit, and fire crews across Essex and Kent dealt with other fires started by lightning.

Some 27 patients on a ward at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, Somerset, also had to be moved when heavy rain brought down part of a ceiling.

An almighty storm saw forks of lightning to hit a family home last night, leaving it engulfed in flames.

Firemen were called to the house in Laughton-en-le-Morthen, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, just before 6pm on Saturday.

The dramatic scenes were captured on camera by neighbours and many thought their own homes had been caught up in fierce bolts.

A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I saw it all happen. It took about 15 minutes from when the lightning hit for the house to catch on fire.

‘I've never witnessed anything like it. I got in and I thought “wow, that was close”. There was an almighty blue ball of flash.

‘We started rushing around the house turning everything off. I just thought “oh my God, my house is shaking”. I seriously thought it had hit my house.

‘The lightning hit quite a few times in the space of five minutes and hit the railings outside too. What people didn't see was the terror on people's faces.

Huge amount of damage: Crews used an aerial ladder platform to put out the fire in Laughton-en-le-Morthen, which ripped through the roof

‘There was just a huge bang and the blue flash was unbelievable. I've not seen anything like it in my life - and I've done a lot of travelling in my time.’

Crews used an aerial ladder platform to put out the fire, which ripped through the roof of the home in the small village.

Homeowner Richard Lowe said his wife Kerry and their three children aged ten, eight and three were out of the house shopping when the bolts struck.

Mr Lowe, who was also out visiting friends, said: ‘I'm still in shock. But no one has been hurt and things can be replaced. It's not really sunk in yet.’

Meanwhile, two families away on holiday had a miraculous escape when their unoccupied homes were destroyed in separate lightning strikes.

Damage: Emergency services dealing with the fallout from the storms arrived to find a home in Hardwicke, Gloucestershire, had been hit on the roof

Emergency services dealing with the fallout from the storms arrived to find a home in Hardwicke, Gloucestershire, had been hit on the roof.

One of the houses was struck in the early hours of Saturday, with the lightning bolt destroying the roof and debris crushing a nearby Honda Jazz.

Craig Smith, a neighbour, said: ‘I saw an almighty flash and mortar flying up in the air. They are a lovely family and they'll be gutted when they get home.

‘I'm just glad they weren't home when it all happened. It happened so close to our house that I just can't fathom it.’

Smoking: A house in Ampney Crucis, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire, was struck yesterday as a huge storm swept across the Cotswolds

Fire crews had to carry out makeshift repairs on the property to make it safe and watertight.

Another house 20 miles away, in Ampney Crucis, near Cirencester, was struck on Saturday afternoon as a huge storm swept across the Cotswolds.

The bolt, as well as destroying the roof, started a major fire in the upper levels of the house, which destroyed the loft and gutted the upper floors.

A neighbour said: ‘We heard the most enormous electric storm. It got struck by a massive bolt of lightning. The windows blew out and the roof caught on fire. It's very, very sad. The family were on holiday in Cornwall and they had to come back to sort it all out and find a new place to live.'
