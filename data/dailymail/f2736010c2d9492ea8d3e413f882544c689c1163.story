Loves the Surface, but tweets with the iPad: Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Microsoft's tablet was marred by her choice of Twitter client

Oprah Winfrey has been vocal about her love for Microsoft's new Surface tablet, claiming earlier this month that it was one of her favourite things.

But that didn't stop the chat show queen sending a tweet claiming she'd bought 12 as Christmas gifts - via the Twitter app on her iPad.

Microsoft has spent $1.5billion and enlisted a string of celebrities to help market their latest gadget - a rival to Apple's offering.

Gwen Stefani, Jessica Alba and Oprah have all endorsed Windows 8 and its mobile phone equivalent, with the latter putting the Surface on her list of 48 favourite things, TechCrunch reported.

However, the latest PR gaffe seems to suggest that however much Oprah promotes Microsoft's latest tech offering, she likes Apple's version even more.

But Oprah's choice of platform highlights the dearth of decent Twitter apps for Surface operating system Windows RT, TechCrunch suggests.

Twitter itself is yet to release an official Twitter client in the Windows Store, but the social messaging site's apps remain among the most popular programs on other platforms.

It is thought that Twitter's delay in releasing an official Windows RT app is a sign that big app developers are not allocating the same resources to Windows Store apps.

But even if Oprah had not been able to track down one of the several third-party Twitter apps that have been published for the Surface, she could have still accessed the Twitter website to send her tweet.

Instead, it appears she used Twitter's official app on the iPad to send the tweet.

Oprah's slip is just the latest blow to Microsoft after the launch of the Surface was marred by a string of negative reviews and, two weeks later, resignation of the head of its Windows division.

The tablet, which is on the market for between £399 and £559, was met with a lukewarm response, with reviewers criticising its lack of apps and branding it 'a compromise'.

Even the most positive review, from technology magazine Wired, would only go so far as describing the tablet as 'quite good'.

The price is the same as the cheapest iPad, pitching Microsoft into a head to head battle with Apple, which has a far greater consumer electronics pedigree.

The chaos which met the product launch was underlined by the departure of Steven Sinofsky, head of Microsoft's Windows unit, a 23-year Microsoft veteran widely tipped as the company's next chief executive.

MailOnline contacted Microsoft for a comment on the Oprah gaffe, but by the time of publication had received no response.
