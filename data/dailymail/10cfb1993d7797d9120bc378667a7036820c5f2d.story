BlackBerry has officially unveiled its next-generation touchscreen smartphone as it ramps up attempts to claw back its share of the market.

Over the past year, BlackBerry has lost 7.5 per cent of its share in the UK to rivals Android, iOS and Windows Phone.

The BlackBerry Z30 comes with a 5-inch screen and the largest battery ever to be built into a BlackBerry handset, which the company claims makes the device last for around 25 hours.

New antenna technology has also been added, designed to boost signal in areas where reception is low.

BlackBerry’s announcement comes just days before Apple’s new iPhones hits shelves on Friday.

Findings from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech show BlackBerry was the third most popular operating system this time last year.

However, the Candian-based firm now owns just 3.5 per cent of the share in the UK, down from 11 per cent.

With the majority of rivals releasing full-touchsreen devices, BlackBerry has had to take a further step away from its trademark physical QWERTY design seen on previous models.

The five-inch Super AMOLED Display is 
powered by a 1.7 GHz processor with quadcore graphics that 'makes 
browsing web pages faster and games more detailed.'

BlackBerry's Z30 also has the firm's Priority Hub built in, which works in a similar way to the notification centres of Android and iOS but with more advanced features.

The Z30 handset, pictured, is the second full touchscreen device to be sold by BlackBerry. The Canadian-based firm is hoping the device will boost flagging sales. Findings from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech show BlackBerry now owns just 3.5 per cent of the share in the UK, down from 11 per cent

In the UK, Android has 55.2 per cent of the market share.

This is ahead of iOS with 31.1 per cent.

Windows Phone makes up 9.2 per cent of smartphone OS sales - up from 4.2 per during the same period last year.

BlackBerry now accounts for 3.5 per cent, down from 11 per cent last year.

For example, the hub is said to be 
able to find and filter messages from a person's favourite contacts by 
'learning what conversations and what people are important'.

In
theory, the more a phone is used, the better the hub becomes at knowing
which messages should be flagged and which can wait.

This includes post
and messages across social networks.

BlackBerry Messenger conversations now appear in any app.

Users can swipe to dismiss them, or click to open them in the BBM app.

The new antenna on the BlackBerry Z30 is said to tune reception in low-signal areas to make sure the user gets the fastest speeds possible.

BlackBerry also claims that the new technology means fewer dropped calls.

Elsewhere, the handset has a 2880 mAh battery - dubbed 'the largest battery ever built into a BlackBerry smartphone' - and combined with battery enhancements made to the BlackBerry 10 OS version 10.2, is said to be capable of lasting up to 25 hours.

Carlo Chiarello, for BlackBerry, said: 'The new BlackBerry Z30 smartphone builds on the solid foundation and engaging user experience of the BlackBerry 10 platform with features like the powerful BlackBerry Hub, its exceptional touchscreen keyboard and industry leading browser.

'The smartphone rounds out the BlackBerry 10 portfolio and is designed for people looking for a smartphone that excels at communications, messaging and productivity.

'Having apps like the full Documents To Go suite that comes pre-installed, together with its 5” touch display, the BlackBerry Z30 smartphone gives you a best in class productivity experience on the go.'

The Z30 will be available from select networks and retailers in the UK and Middle East from the beginning of next week.

It will then be rolled out to other regions before the end of the year.
