New Jersey Governor Chris Christie got a break from traffic scandals and budget woes today when he was declared Father of the Year - though his 18-year-old daughter, Sarah, didn't look too impressed.

The National Father's Day Committee crowned the Republican governor at a ceremony in Manhattan. Other honorees included football Hall of Famer Curtis Martin, shoe designer Vince Camuto and Bloomingdale's CEO Tony Spring.

The famously combative Christie joked that when his four kids, ages 10 to 20, found out he'd been chosen for the honor, they reacted with disbelief.

'The response was universal. They just
 blankly stared back at me and said, "Really?"' Christie told attendees 
gathered in a hotel ballroom.

'And I felt very warm about that.'

And
 Sarah Christie for one seemed to be serious, judging by the bored look 
on her face as she was photographed attending the event with her dad.

Christie often mentions his kids at public events, joking about their argumentative dinner table conversations.

He
 said he was also surprised by the award and, in a more serious tone, 
thanked his kids for putting up with 'me and my crazy life.'

'For
 me, today is really recognition for the best thing that I get to do in 
my life. I get recognized and criticized and praised for all kinds of 
other things, but the most important thing that I get to do every day is
 to be a father to my four children,' he said.

Still,
 Christie couldn't quite escape the George Washington Bridge scandal 
that has cast a shadow on his 2016 presidential ambitions.

Contenders: There honorees, from left, were Robert Reed, the 2014 All Star Dad; Mr Christie, Vince Camuto, CEO of the Camuto Group; Tony Spring, chairman and CEO of Bloomingdale's; and former New York Jets football player Curtis Martin

As she introduced the governor, joking about his 'small personality' and 'modesty,' awards presenter Norah O'Donnell of CBS took a dig at the scandal, describing Christie as 'governor of New Jersey - you know, that state right across the GW Bridge.'

The governor took the remarks in stride, however, playfully raising his eyebrows.

Later he joked that while in New York, he would refer to New Jersey as 'the place on the other side of the Lincoln Tunnel.'

Previous recipients of the award include former presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan.
