An outgoing Connecticut fire captain stole some vintage photos of a young victim of the historic Hartford circus fire from the walls of the firehouse and burned them at his own home, saying he could not retire knowing the little girl was being displayed in such an inappropriate way.

William Pond, the now-former Captain of the Hartford Fire Department, said he felt the pictures of the dead eight-year-old were 'publicly displayed in this horrific manner', particularly because the girl was naked.

The victim was Eleanor Cook, who was one of more than 167 people who died in the massive tent fire at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Hartford in July 1944, according to NBC News.

The images of Cook's body are believed to have been part of a display of photos from the scene of the disaster, which had been at the Engine 14 firehouse location for years.

Over 700 were injured in the horrific big top blaze, which lead to an overhaul of fire procedure changes and is considered one of the worst fires in U.S. history.

What Capt. Pond chose to do with the photos was recently revealed in an email that he sent to the incoming Captain, Carlos Huertas, which was obtained by NBC.

Pond explained in the email how he first felt the images were inappropriate when he started at the firehouse as a young man, and that his feelings continued up until becoming captain in 2011.

'When originally assigned to engine 14 in the summer of 1990 I objected to the naked deceased pictures of Eleanor Cook displayed in the hallway,' Pond said in the email.

'I objected verbally to every house Captain through my career where my efforts proved fruitless. 

'My first order of business as house Captain was to remove them from display.'

Pond said he believed he had to do more than just pull he photos down, the emails said.  

'I removed them today and at my home prayed for peace for Eleanor and burned them in my fireplace. 

'I hope you understand and also the Cook family had no knowledge that there [sic] loved one was publicly displayed in this horrific manor [sic].'

He added that he thought 'this poor girls [sic] soul would never rest' if the photos were put back up after he retired.

Pond retired over 18 months ago, however the email has only just come to light.

However, at the time, his judgement was not appreciated by Capt Huertas, Pond's successor, who criticized Pond for acting inappropriately.

He said Pond 'exercised poor judgment in removing the photos'.

'He has demonstrated a lack of professionalism in his decision to take matters in to his own hands and circumvented the process put forth to better handle the situation,' Huertas told NBC.

Huertas also said that while Pond likely thought he was destroying originals, the photos turned out to be copies with 'no intrinsic value'.

During the fire on July 6, 1944, there were 7,000 people at the circus.

Most of those in attendance were women and children. 

The Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus was the largest in the country at the time, and their big top could seat 9,000 people. 

The big top had been waterproofed with paraffin wax, which was a common waterproofing method.

The cause of the fire has never been properly proven, but was suspected to have been caused by a cigarette.

Several years after the tragedy, while being investigated on other arson charges, Robert Dale Segeewho, who was an adolescent at the time, confessed to starting the blaze, but was never tried  and later recanted his confession.

John B. Stewart, the former Hartford fire chief, was 14 years old at the time of the fire.

He remembers being outside the tent when it erupted.

'I looked up, and I heard screaming, and we saw the thick black smoke,' he told NBC.

The disaster lead to strict fire department changes when it came to circus tents.

Only flame retardant tents were allowed to be used, and fire extinguishers had to be every 50-100 feet away. 

Connecticut police and the local fire department had to present at all events as well.
