Nearly six months after allegedly leaving her newborn baby to die in a garbage can, a Salt Lake City woman has been ruled incompetent to stand trial because she has an IQ of 51. 

Since Alicia Englert's two-day-old daughter was found in her neighbor's trash bin in August, there has been an ongoing debate on the 23-year-old's mental state at the time of the incident. 

Englert maintained an online dating profile throughout her pregnancy and online photos appear to show her drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing in the months before her daughter was born. 

But based on court-ordered evaluations and the testimony of two mental health experts, Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills ruled on Monday that Englert is mentally disabled and has an IQ too low for her to legally stand trial on a felony attempted murder charge.

Court-ordered evaluations found that Alicia Englert, 23, is mentally disabled and has an IQ of 51 - too low for her to legally stand trial for allegedly leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can near Salt Lake City

Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills said Englert will enter treatment. The judge set a new hearing date for June 8 to re-assess whether she's become competent for trial

Utah law says a defendant must have an IQ of 70 to face trial. Below 70 is considered an 'intellectual disability', licensed psychologist Karen Malm told Fox 13.

Though Malm did not conduct Englert's competency evaluation, she told Fox 13 that the score of 51 suggests that Englert functions at a level of a ten- to 12-year-old child. 

Englert was able to finish high school, but a single in-depth conversation shows she didn't function at typical adult level, lawyer Josie Brumfield said.

In a Wechsler IQ Test, an 'average classification' score is between 90 and 109. 

An attorney for Englert's parents called for the charge to be dismissed. 

'She doesn't understand the gravity of what took place, and the finding of incompetency confirms that,' Jessica Peterson said. 

Judge Hruby-Mills said Englert will enter treatment. The judge set a new hearing date for June 8 to re-assess whether she's become competent for trial.  

Prosecutors will take another look at the case to decide what happens next, Salt Lake County District Sim Gill said.

Court documents say Englert gave birth in a bathroom at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns and left the baby girl without food or medical care for a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash on August 26 

In some cases, defendants are able to face charges after treatment, but sometimes the setback for prosecutors is permanent, he said.

Court documents say Englert gave birth in a bathroom at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns and left the baby girl without food or medical care for a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash on August 26, 2014.

Prosecutors say the infant would have died if she had not been found by a neighbor who thought she heard a cat purring in the garbage. 

The baby was suffering from hypothermia, respiratory distress and a blood-borne infection when she was found.

Englert's father, Robert said at the time that his daughter had a learning disability and didn't understand the pregnancy or the implications of abandoning the baby.

Her baby was flown to a hospital and placed on a ventilator, but she recovered and is being adopted.

Judge Hruby-Mills granted a supervised 90-minute goodbye visit for Englert and her family in December, a fairly common allowance for parents whose rights are terminated after their children are taken into state custody.  

Fox 13 reported on Englert's 'Meet Me :)' online dating profile, which stated she didn't have any children.

In full, her 'About Me' section read, 'hi my name is alicia im 23 years old I work full time I have brown hair im 5'1 I have no kids I do drink but only on the weekends I have my own car I still live with my mom and dad for now!!! if you want to know more just ask ;)'

Jessica Peterson, an attorney for Englert's parents, said the woman 'doesn't understand the gravity of what took place' and that the competency exam findings comfirm that

Her profile appears to still be active, though most of the information has been deleted.   

Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Gill said.

Englert's lawyer argues that she had a difficult childhood - her mother went to prison when she was about 18 months old. 

'She kind of got lost in the cracks, really didn't get any help or treatment,' Brumfield said. 

Englert has not entered a plea. She appeared in court on Monday with her parents wearing a black jacket and green blouse, and did not take questions from reporters. 

She remained free on bail after Monday's hearing, and state authorities will evaluate Englert to decide what form her treatment will take, Brumfield said.

But Robert Englert, said in September that his daughter had only just started to realize what she had done.

'She doesn't even realize that it's a crime and it's bad,' Englert told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'Even when the police were taking her to jail, she thought they were taking her to her room.'
