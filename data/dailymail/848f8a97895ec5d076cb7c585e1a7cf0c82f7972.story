The tattered remains of a little pair of pink pants have washed up on a beach, similar in style to those worn by two-year-old Cayleigh Harrison when she went missing nearby.

Cayleigh vanished in April during a family trip to the beach in Rockport, Massachusetts. The piece of clothing was found last Friday by a public works employee who found them caught up in fishing gear.

The mother and father of Cayleigh, say her four-year-old sister saw a man take her away and have 
maintained suspicion that their daughter was kidnapped.

Clue: A tattered pair of pink pants have been found similar to those worn by two-year-old Caleigh Harrison when she went missing from a beach in Rockport, Massachusetts in April

'The pants are consistent in size, color, and style with those that 
Caleigh Harrison was wearing when she disappeared while playing on 
Rockport’s Long Beach,' State Police spokesman David Procopio said in a 
statement.

Police had been combing Good Harbor Beach in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in search of clues
to the little girl's disappearance, but gave up their search a week 
later saying that Caleigh was likely dragged out to sea.

The pants were found last week caught up in debris thrown ashore by Hurricane Sandy.

Anthony Harrison and Alison Hammond went on the Nancy Grace
show in May to share a drawing Caleigh's sister Elizabeth made of the 
man who they believe kidnapped their two-year-old daughter.

Caleigh was last seen by her mother on a footbridge linking Long Beach and Cape Hedge Beach in Rockport, Massachusetts.

The
spot is near an estuary that was emptying into the ocean as the tide 
went out. Seas were reported to be 10 to 12 feet with strong rip 
currents.

The sisters 
were playing with a ball that bounced over a wall. Their mother went to 
retrieve it and when she returned, Caleigh was gone.

Holding on to Hope: Anthony Harrison and Alison Hammond went on the Nancy Grace show to share a drawing Caleigh's sister Elizabeth made of the man who may have kidnapped Caleigh

Who to Believe? Officials say there is no evidence of foul play, but Elizabeth, 4, drew this photo of the 'abductor'

Police conducted an extensive search of the beach, deploying half a dozen divers to comb the water during a week-long hunt.

They do not suspect any foul play, but since the search had turned up no clues, the girl's family has held onto their suspicion that she was kidnapped.

'It was a pretty big search and they had a lot of resources there, and I don’t think she’s in the water,' Anthony Harrison said on television.

He told Nancy Grace that a few days 
after the disappearance, Caleigh's sister Elizabeth claimed she saw a 
mysterious man on the beach.

'She mentions a man. It’s a little 
bit scattered because she is four years old, but she did after a while 
mention a man on the beach that took her sister,' Mr Harrison said.

'It’s kind of hard to take a four-year-old’s word for it, but we’re looking into it.'

Missing: But the search yielded no clues as to Caleigh's whereabouts

Elizabeth calls the alleged abductor the 'mean man' and describes him as wearing black shorts, having facial hair and smoking a cigarette.

Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio said in May they are prepared to follow any lead thoroughly.

'As we previously stated, we found no evidence to support the abduction theory,' he said in a statement released to the press after the family appeared on the Nancy Grace show.

'That does not mean that we can say with 100 percent certainty that foul play did not occur, but rather, only that we have found no evidence of it, including no evidence of a mysterious man on the beach.'
