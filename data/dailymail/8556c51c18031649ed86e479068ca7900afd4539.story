Western Australia hasn’t been a good place for sharks and whales to visit recently, with the state government trialling their controversial shark cull program.

But one baby humpback was lucky to have encountered a group of fishermen from New Zealand when it was caught in cray pot lines near Geraldton, off Australia’s western coast.

It took serious guts for one of the boat’s crew members to swim out and free the baby whale, which looks more like a large shark.

The whale appeared distressed to begin with – attempting to swim lower to get under the net, before releasing air from its blowhole.

Once the ship’s skipper swam away from the boat towards the struggling whale and attempted to liberate it, the baby humpback remained near the man and appeared to be slightly more relaxed.

With the men on the boat cheering him on, the skipper attempted to cut the baby humpback free from the net.

He struggled to release the whale, despite the suggestions from the men still on the boat.

'Cut it closer,’ the man holding the camera directed.

'Don't try and get it off, mate, just cut the line.’

The boat’s skipper attempted to cut the whale free from the rope with a knife, leaving some of the rope remaining – so as not to distress it by getting too close and allowing it to swim free.

Eventually, the whale swims free and the men on the boat congratulate the man who did the hard work of actually releasing the baby humpback.

'That's it, go free baby!' the man holding the camera cheers.

'Well done little fella,’ he then said.

Speaking with New Zealand’s 3 News, the skipper’s father says his son wouldn’t have had a second thought about jumping into the water to rescue the struggling baby whale.

‘If he'd thought about it, he wouldn’t have done it. The whale was in the shit, so he jumped in and did it,’ Paddy Brogan said.

Mr Brogan also added that his son, who has been working as a skipper for around six years, said releasing the whale was a wonderful feeling.
