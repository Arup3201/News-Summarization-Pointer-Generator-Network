An RAC mechanic who was crushed by the Jaguar as he was worked underneath it was saved by a team of rugby players who were able to lift the one-tonne car off him.

Jason Hutchings had raised the S-type car on a jack, only for the car to slip and pin him to the ground in the car park of Canterbury Rugby Club, Kent, leaving him unconscious with several broken bones.

The father-of-two was only saved thanks to the members of the club who hauled the heavy car off him after the accident.

Mr Hutchings, 38, fractured his vertebrae, broke several ribs and suffered multiple fractures of his collarbone when the car fell on top of him.

He was airlifted to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, where he remains on oxygen a week later.

'Without the help of the guys at the rugby club I would be dead,' said Mr Hutchings.

'It was a big car - it must have weighed a tonne and I just thought they would never, ever be able to lift it off me, it was impossible.

'But they did and I am eternally grateful to them.'

He added: 'All I remember is thinking there is no way I'm going to get out of this. I thought 'that's it, it's over'.

'I don't believe it was a fault with the equipment. It was just one of those things. I'll go back to work but I'll just be a bit more conscious about what I am doing.'

Mr Hutchings had been using a locking trolley jack, axl stand and wheel chock to support the car, but it had slipped off the jack.

He said: 'It's one of those things, the car slipped off the jack, it was on a slope. It was not me being incompetent nor was it an equipment fault, it can happen to anyone.' 

Mr Hutchings hopes to be discharged from hospital this weekend and back home in Faversham, with wife Karen, 40, and their daughters Caitlin, six, and Morgan, four.

And after working for the RAC for nearly nine years, he says the experience will not put him off returning to work.

'I just want to thank everyone for their help. I wouldn't be here without them all,' he said.

Rugby club chairman Giles Hilton said: 'It's pretty fortunate that we were there.

'We'll have to remind any future RAC workmen to only come on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when the players are training.

'But jokes aside, we are very pleased with the actions the guys took, and presumably it was those actions that saved this man's life.

'I am incredibly proud of the club and the swift move that members took to make sure this man survived.'

RAC spokesman Pete Williams also thanked the players on behalf of the roadside recovery service.

'We are very grateful to members of the club and the public who helped and actually lifted the vehicle off the patrolman,' he said.

'Our thoughts are with him and his family and we are providing every support. A full investigation into the incident is under way.'

The Health and Safety Executive said it will also be investigating the incident.
