England’s Euro-flops flipped the hand-wringers into overdrive, like a Le Mans-style dash for their favourite hobby horse as soon as Manchester City’s fate was sealed in Barcelona.

Winter breaks, possession statistics, revenue streams, what’s your poison? Or any other hell-in-a-handcart issue which is about to bring down our national game.

Two years in three without a team in the Champions League quarter-finals is a worrying trend and the Barclays Premier League will lose its cherished four-team party invite if it cannot be reversed.

There is no English presence in the Europa League either after Everton’s harsh lesson in Kiev on Thursday night.

Yet in Germany, a similar debate is unfolding because Bayern Munich are the Bundesliga’s sole representatives in the last eight, two years after Bayern and Borussia Dortmund contested the Champions League final at Wembley and nine months after the World Cup triumph.

‘There is no time to rest, no time to ease off,’ said Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German FA. 

‘We have to keep at it if we are to remain at the top.’

In England, the usual excuses were aired but it is to be hoped the big clubs are looking at what they might do to improve as well as grumbling about how the system is stacked against them.

Too many games? 

Let’s start with the favourite complaint of the managers who overlook how the extra income from the Champions League should improve their squad, if spent wisely.

Besides, who has the most games? Barcelona have played 44 to City’s 42 this season, Chelsea 44 to Paris Saint-Germain’s 45 and Arsenal played 45 to Monaco’s 44. Lionel Messi has played 3,531 minutes for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo 3,323 for Real Madrid, while Alexis Sanchez has played 3,326 for Arsenal and Eden Hazard 3,539 for Chelsea.

It’s more intense in England, they say. No easy games, more physical, no respite. Well, it always has been this way.

It was in the 1970s when Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa were winning the European Cup and it was in 2008 when Manchester United and Chelsea were in the final in Moscow and half of the last eight were from the Premier League.

The intensity of English football used to be considered an advantage with improved fitness and hardened minds. Modern players may run more but usually on better pitches, with lighter balls.

 In fact, footballers have never had it quite so good. At the top of the Premier League they have the best money can buy in terms of physical care from the moment they step into the academy building. But tell them they are tired and they might feel tired.

When competition ends, touring begins. Tottenham will visit Australia in May. 

Southampton were skiing in Switzerland earlier this month. Manchester City flew to Abu Dhabi before returning to lose at home to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup.

Chelsea had two days off and a free week to prepare before they were knocked out of Europe by PSG.

The wrong type of football? 

The competitive tempo which gives English football its appeal will never nurture a player like Andrea Pirlo, and yet all-action midfielders thrive in the domestic game, living on mistakes which rarely occur against the best European teams.

This is perhaps most keenly felt at international level. Only one English outfield player started for Manchester City in the Nou Camp, and it was not all James Milner’s fault. City have a foreign team and a Chilean manager.

Arsenal have not subscribed to traditional English values for years. Few pass the ball better than Arsene Wenger’s teams and few have played in the Champions League with such regularity without winning it.

James Milner was the only English outfield player to start for City against Barcelona on Wednesday night

Barcelona can mesmerise in possession, but it is four years since they made a final.

In the 2010 semis, they lost to an Inter Milan team that did not want to know the ball. 

It is about finding ways to win, which is what Chelsea were doing when they surrounded the referee against PSG.

Since West Ham won the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1965, through the domination of Liverpool and into the renaissance led by Manchester United and maintained by Chelsea, English clubs have been successful with fast, aggressive football and spirited, well-balanced sides.

In the past two years, our strongest teams have dipped. The Chelsea side first built by Mourinho is being rebuilt and the new model is not yet as good. 

United are in post-Fergie turmoil, Arsenal are left short by the same old problems and City are still trying to learn what it takes. 

There are also the restrictions of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules but English clubs do not want for income, thanks to a bumper television deal, which is about to get even bigger.

Money is not the problem. It guarantees nothing in any case. Real Madrid spent a fortune chasing their 10th European Cup.

Chelsea were the last English to to win the Champions League, defeating Bayern Munich on penalties in 2012

It took them more than a decade because they became obsessed with superstars and forgot about the team.

In England wealth confuses strategy. Clubs have realigned for the Moneyball generation with sporting directors, finance experts and sports scientists involved in transfers while coaches are marginalised.

The upshot? 

Squads lack balance and big-money investments sit on the bench because managers cannot — or will not — accommodate them.

What is United’s recruitment strategy? Are City about to sack Manuel Pellegrini and start again? Will Wenger ever change his approach? 

Yes, a winter break might be helpful, as would the complete restructure of the English league system.

And yes, it would be nice if English players could pass the ball, and clubs should invest in youth development until they can.

But if our Euro-flops are to flip and rule the Champions League again, they must use their millions more carefully and build better teams.
