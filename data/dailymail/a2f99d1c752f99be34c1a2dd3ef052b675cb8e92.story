Move over rats and squirrels, an increasing numbers of big cats and wildlife are giving up their natural habitat to come and live in the sprawling cities.

A new study led by WCS-India scientist Vidya Athreaya finds that certain landscapes of western India completely devoid of wilderness and with high human populations are crawling with a different kind of backyard wildlife: leopards.

The study found as many as five adult large carnivores, including leopards and striped hyenas, per 100 square kilometres, a density never before reported in a human-dominated landscape.

Spot on: Leopards are loving the urban environment, forsaking the tough life in the jungle

The study, called Big Cats in Our Backyards, appeared in the March 6 edition of the journal PLoS One.

Using camera traps, the authors founds that leopards often ranged close to houses at night though remained largely undetected by the public.

Despite this close proximity between leopards and people, there are few instances of attacks in this region.

The authors also photographed rusty spotted cat, small Indian civet, Indian fox, jungle cat, jackal, mongoose – and a variety of people from the local communities. The research took place in western Maharashtra, India.

‘Human attacks by leopards were rare despite a potentially volatile situation considering that the leopard has been involved in serious conflict, including human deaths in adjoining areas,’ said big cat expert Ullas Karanth of WCS.

‘The results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both humans and wildlife to each other's presence.’

The authors say that the findings show that conservationists must look outside of protected areas for a more holistic approach to safeguarding wildlife in a variety of landscapes.

The study was located in the Ahmednagar district of western Maharashtra, India.

According to Wildlife Conservation Society big cat expert Ullas Karanth: ‘The results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both humans and wildlife to each other’s presence.’

The findings also suggest that conservationists must look outside of protected areas for a more holistic approach to studying wildlife and their expanding habitats.

During the last twenty years, there has been an increasing awareness of the ability of some large predators like wolves and pumas to live in very human-dominated environments in the developed world.

Most examples of large carnivores in urban landscapes are from countries with a low human population density although in the case of mountain lions in Southern California,

It has been seen that part of their home ranges overlap with densely populated urban landscapes.

Recent results from Africa show comparable densities for lions, cheetahs and jackals inside and outside the protected areas, although the human population density there was low.

Very little is known about the ecology of ‘urban’ carnivores in densely populated countries where the potential for conflict can be very high.

For instance, India has a high diversity of large carnivores, many of which share spaces with one of the highest human and livestock populations in the world.

The most common is the leopard, which is frequently reported from many human dominated landscapes across India where it is involved in a wide range of conflict situations, often with fatal outcomes for humans.
