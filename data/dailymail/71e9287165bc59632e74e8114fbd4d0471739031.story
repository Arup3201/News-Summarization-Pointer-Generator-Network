Astronomers have found a planet just 13 light years from Earth that is ripe for life, with just the right mild temperatures to allow liquid water on its surface.

And the ‘super-Earth’ is all the more interesting because it originated from another galaxy, meaning it could play host to extragalactic life.

The star it orbits - Kapteyn’s star - was flung into the Milky Way when its previous galaxy was torn apart by our own.

Two planets have been found in orbit around a star just 13 light years from Earth, known as Kapteyn's star, and one of them named Kapteyn b (the innermost planet in this illustration) may play host to life. The red-hue colour tries to reproduce the colour of the ambient light a human might perceive on planets around such red stars

The planet is one of two discovered around Kapteyn’s star.

Scientists believe it was born in a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed and destroyed by our own Milky Way galaxy.

At only 13 light years away from Earth Kapteyn's star is the 25th nearest star to the sun.

Based on the data collected, the planet Kapetyn b is at least five times as massive as the Earth and it orbits the star every 48 days.

This means the planet is warm enough for liquid water to be present on its surface.

The second planet, Kapteyn c is a more massive super-Earth and quite different: its year lasts for 121 days and astronomers think it's too cold to support liquid water.

At the moment, only a few properties of the planets are known: approximate masses, orbital periods, and distances to the star.

By measuring the atmosphere of these planets with next-generation instruments, scientists will try to find out whether they can bear water.

The surviving core of the dwarf remains in the form of Omega Centauri, a globular cluster of very ancient stars some 16,000 light years from the sun.

Details of the research are published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters.

'Finding a stable planetary system with a potentially habitable planet 
orbiting one of the very nearest stars in the sky is mind blowing,' says US
 co-author Dr Pamela Arriagada, from the Carnegie Institution.

'This
 is one more piece of evidence that nearly all stars have planets, and 
that potentially habitable planets in our galaxy are as common as grains
 of sand on a beach.'

Astronomers
 have calculated that Kapteyn’s star’s planets could be 11.5 billion 
years old - more than twice the age of Earth and only about 2 billion 
years younger than the universe itself.

One
 of the worlds, Kapteyn b, is five times heavier than Earth, making it a
 super-Earth, and orbits in the star’s habitable zone where conditions
 are mild enough to permit watery oceans.

Whether
 life has evolved there remains open to speculation - but given the 
planet’s age it could be far more advanced than on Earth.

'It does make you wonder what kind of life could have evolved on those planets over such a long time,' says Dr Guillem Anglada-Escude, one of the scientists from Queen Mary University of London involved in the discovery.

The astronomers used new data from the HARPS spectrometer at the ESO's La Silla observatory in Chile to measure tiny periodic changes in the star to find and measure the planets. The study also used data from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii (pictured) and the Magellan/Las Campanas Observatory in Chile

Kapteyn's star and its planets likely come from a dwarf galaxy now merged with the Milky Way (illustrated here after the event). The star is now in the vicinity of the sun but is currently moving in the opposite direction to the rotation of the other stars in our galaxy

The second planet, Kapteyn c, is more massive than its sibling and thought to be too cold to support liquid water.

Kapteyn’s star, a red dwarf cooler than the Sun, was named after Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn who discovered it at the end of the 19th century.

It can be seen in the southern constellation of Pictor with an amateur telescope and sits in the galactic halo, an extended cloud of stars orbiting the Milky Way.

Astronomers found the planets by using specialised instruments on telescopes in Chile and Hawaii to measure tiny 'wobbles' of the star caused by their gravity.

Shifts in the 'colour' of star light due to the wobbles allowed them to work out properties of the planets such as their masses and orbital periods.

'We were surprised to find planets orbiting Kapteyn’s star,' says Dr Anglada-Escude.

'Previous data showed some moderate excess of variability, so we were looking for very short period planets when the new signals showed up loud and clear.'
