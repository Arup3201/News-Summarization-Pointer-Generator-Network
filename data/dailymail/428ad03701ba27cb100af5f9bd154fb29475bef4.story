Hunted: An artist's impression shows a primitive Yeti emerging from a cave

They have long been thought to be merely the stuff of legend.

But Russian officials say they have found ‘indisputable evidence’ that yetis exist – and are living in Siberia.

The bold claim follows an international conference and expedition to track down the Abominable Snowman in the Mount Shoria area.

However, doubt has already been cast on the ‘find’ – as the team has no convincing photographic or DNA evidence. Their claim appears to be based on bent branches, a single unclear footprint and a small sample of grey ‘hair’, found in a cave.

The administration of the Kemerovo region, where the cave is situated, yesterday announced that ‘indisputable evidence’ had been found.

But critics said the expedition was more about making the area a tourist destination than true science.

Researchers who led the search said that they are closer than ever to catching one the creatures.

'During the expedition to the Azasskaya cave, conference participants gathered indisputable proof that the Shoria mountains are inhabited by the Snow Man,' the Kemerovo region administration announced yesterday.

'They found his footprints, his supposed bed, and various markers with which the Yeti uses to denote his territory.'

The markers appeared to be mainly broken trees and some Russian media reports have treated the Yeti claims with considerable scepticism.

Despite this, the local government officials professed themselves either certain or 95 per cent certain of the existence of Yeti in a highland area known as Mount Shoria.

The researchers themselves were less 
keen than the officials to claim the Yeti is definitely real. They 
stressed that the hair sample should be analysed for DNA - a process now
 underway - before any claims were made.

A bed of sticks they claimed that the Yeti had slept on is not thought to have contained hair samples.

Despite this, Dr Igor Burtsev, leader of the international event - the first of its kind for half a century, claimed it would not be long before people everywhere would appreciate the Yeti's existence.

'We are close to finally finding the Abominable Snowman,' he said.

He claims around 30 Yetis live in the Kemerovo region, adding that they are Neandethal men who have survived to this day.

It is clear that since the fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago there have been increased 'sightings' of Yeti, and it is claimed more than a dozen villagers and hunters in this vast mountainous region close to the town of Tashtagol have given written accounts of either seeing the beasts themselves or finding their tracks.

There are also reports of the Yeti - claimed to be around 7ft-tall - stealing livestock from remote farms.

The
 first accounts of Yetis emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists 
who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas.

They
 depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and 
carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound.

The
 term Abominable Snowman was developed in 1921 following a book by 
Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury called Mount Everest The 
Reconnaissance.

Popular 
interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists 
began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the Yeti. 
They reported seeing strange markings in the snow.

The
 Daily Mail led a trip called the the Snowman Expedition in 1954 to 
Everest. During the trip mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson 
photographed ancient paintings of Yetis and large footprints in the 
snow.

A number of hair 
samples were also found that were believed to have come from a Yeti 
scalp.

British
 mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when 
scaling Annapurna in 1970. He said that while searching for a campsite 
he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a Yeti's call. 
That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp.

It is understood none of these local eye-witnesses gave evidence directly to the session, though participants heard other accounts from around the globe.

'We were shown some twisted willow branches that are referred to as markers - they were convincing evidence of this hominoid,' said Canadian Yeti researcher, John Binderangel, who has spent three decades hunting for conclusive proof of the Yeti.

'There were also some tracks, but we're not quite sure what to make of them.'

An American housewife told the conference she regularly feeds Yeti in her back garden in Michegan but was unable to produce a single photograph of an elusive creature rumoured to exist for thousands of years.

One cynical Russian media report summed up the mission as 'we haven't actually found anything, but we very, very much wanted to have found something'.

Shortly before the 'experts' arrived, another hunt to the same cave to find the Yeti was led by the 'Beast of the East' - former Russian heavyweight boxing champion Nikolai Valuyev. It ended in failure, though locals saw it as a key plank in the region's bid to boost tourism.

'Valuyev did not manage to meet the Yeti itself but on the way he discovered 'traces' such as broken tree branches,' said a spokesman.

'I saw lots of journalists but no Yetis,' admitted the boxer.

Dmitry Islamov, Vice Governor of Kemerovo Region on Economics and Regional Development said: 'It doesn't matter that the Kuzbass might not have Yetis. The main thing is that when people come to the Shoria Mountains, they truly enjoy its unique nature.'
