Divers equipped with sonar and underwater cameras are scouring the ocean for Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott, who authorities believe was 'strangled' or 'suffocated' a week ago by an aspiring 
actor and martial arts instructor.

'We truly believe she’s in the ocean, and we’re just waiting for her to 
come back to shore,' said Dawn Downey of Westboro, a family friend.

Though the search was briefly called off, authorities have no focused their efforts on the waters around Peirce Island in nearby Pourtsmouth.

Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young told reporters that 'credible information' led authorities to the 27-acre island that separates the city from the Piscataqua River.

Though marine patrol officials have sonar and underwater imaging systems, the river's currents and eddies have slowed their 
efforts.

'The search in that area may last several more days,' Young said. 'We have
 not discussed an end date. We have discussed continuing this until we 
find her.'

Authorities in Maine and Massachusetts have also been asked to watch their shorelines in case  Marriott's body washes up.

Aspiring
 actor and model Seth Mazzaglia, 29, of Dover, was ordered to be held 
without bail on Monday on a second-degree murder charge in connection 
with the death of 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough,
 Massachusetts.

Officials announced charges against him on Saturday, after family and friends spent several days searching for her.

Mazzaglia was arraigned by video feed and did not speak. His next hearing is set for October 29.

Authorities will not say what led to the arrest but simply it was due to evidence collected.

On Saturday night, hundreds of friends and family members attended an emotional candlelit vigil for Lizzi at the Bay State Commons.

Her devastated father Robert Marriott and best friend Meghan Hoyt were among those pictured at the solemn evening held in tribute to the young student.

During a press conference to 
announce Mazzaglia's arrest, Assistant Attorney General James Vara said 
that the Dover Police Department have gathered enough credible 
information to believe that Marriott is dead - although they have not 
located her body.

Together
 with Portsmouth and state police, authorities in Denver have been 
searching the area around Prescott Park and Pierce Island since around 
7.30pm on Saturday.

But by Sunday afternoon, the crime scene tape had been removed, and where the shoreline had been off-limits, people could be seen walking their dogs.

The assistant attorney general also 
announced that Marriott's car, a 2001 tan-colored Mazda tribute had been
 located and in addition Vera confirmed that there were no threats in 
existence to other students at the University of New Hampshire.

'I
 want to confirm there are no threats to the other students at UNH,' he 
said. 'This is unrelated other than the fact she's a student at the 
university.'

Claiming that the ongoing 
investigation precluded him from discussing details, Vera admitted that 
Marriott and Mazzaglia knew each other.

'This is still an active and ongoing investigation,' said Vara.

'We will continue with any and all resources available to us.'

The announcement of the arrest and declaration that Marriott was in all probability dead came at 1pm yesterday, and family members were informed they should 'stand down' their search for their loved one.

Marriott's aunt, Rebecca Tyning, confirmed that authorities told them to stop their search before the afternoon announcement.

In a phone interview with Foster's Daily Democrat, Tyning called the announcement of her niece's death 'surreal'.

Marriott was a marine biology major who lived with her aunt in Chester. She was a 2011 graduate of Westborough High School in Massachusetts.

She had attended a class at the university on Tuesday night and made plans to visit a friend in Dover. Police tracked down the friends, who said Lizzi never arrived that evening.

Authorities have also analyzed her cell phone records - and those of her friends - and discovered she texted a friend at 10.11pm on Tuesday, saying she was on her way to Dover.

But that was the last activity on her phone and her bank accounts have not been accessed since.

The suspect, Seth J. Mazzaglia is listed as living at apartment 341 in the complex of 1 Mill Street in Dover.

His website indicates that he is an 'experienced actor, writer and fight choreographer' who stands 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 220 pounds.

He claims that his 'special skills and talents' include a third degree black belt in Okinawan karate and that he is proficient with a samurai sword, butterfly swords and other hand held weapons.

Robert Modee, who is a Kittery, Maine, martial arts instructor, confirmed that Mazzaglia is an expert in karate and that he trained with the suspect for almost 20-years.

'He's been with me, training with me, since he was probably 10 or 12 years old,' Modee said.

Indeed, just before his arrest, Mazzaglia had been giving martial arts lessons to children at the Kittery Community Center said Modee.

'I don't understand what's going on right now,' Modee said. 'I'm completely floored with all this. I don't even know what to think.'

As well as his expertise in hand-to-hand combat, Mazzaglia claimed to have performed in 17 theater productions between 2000 and 2010.

In 2005, Mazzaglia played the role of Richie Valens in a July performance of The Buddy Holly Story, at Seacoast Repertory Theater.

One former cast member, Brett Wulfson said she remembered Mazzaglia as a pleasant man, 'very involved with self-defense'.

In addition, Mazzaglia claims to have a 750 hour certification in massage therapy awarded by McIntosh College in 2007.

Marriott was a 2011 graduate of Westborough High School in Massachusetts. She lived with an aunt in Chester and commuted to the Durham campus. A message seeking comment was left with her parents, Robert and Melissa Marriott of Westborough, Mass.

Before today's tragic news Lizzi's grandmother, Susan Marriott, had been desperately tending the phone's at the Chester home where her granddaughter lived 
while other family members were out handing out fliers and searching for
 her.

'She
 is a good student and she's hard-working,' her grandmother said. 'She 
is a person that doesn't have a multitude of friends but she has good 
friends, a small group of good friends.'
