Police investigating allegations of football spot-fixing are set to review a yellow-card tackle by a former Premier League player who is among six people arrested over the claims of illegality.

Blackburn Rovers striker DJ Campbell was arrested yesterday by the National Crime Agency as part of the investigation.

According to reports, officers may review the yellow card he received for a tackle committed 
in the first half of Blackburn's league game against Ipswich Town last 
Tuesday.

Five people, including Campbell, have been bailed until April, and a sixth is still being questioned, the NCA has said.

Police are likely to review this tackle by DJ Campbell, for which he received a yellow card, during the game between Ipswich Town and Blackburn Rovers last Tuesday, it has been reported

The 32-year-old, who joined Rovers on a 
free transfer in the summer, was arrested by the NCA after it acted on 
information passed by the Sun on Sunday newspaper.

In a statement, Blackburn Rovers FC 
said: 'Following reports in today's national media, Blackburn Rovers can
confirm that striker DJ Campbell has been arrested.

'The club will be making no further comment on what is now an ongoing legal matter.'

The
tabloid reported that an undercover investigator met former Portsmouth 
player Sam Sodje, who allegedly said he could arrange for footballers in
the Championship to get themselves a yellow card in return for tens of 
thousands of pounds.

The
34-year-old claimed he could rig Premier League games and even allegedly said he 
was preparing to fix matches at next year's World Cup in Brazil, the 
newspaper reported.

In a 
video recorded by the undercover reporter from the Sun on Sunday, Sodje apparently 
admitted punching an opponent in the groin to get sent off for a £70,000
pay-out.

It also 
alleged that Oldham Athletic player Cristian Montano failed to get a 
yellow card in return for money in a match against Wolverhampton 
Wanderers on October 22 and offered to take part in another rigging 
incident.

In today's edition of The Sun,
it was reported that Campbell was arrested yesterday a day after he 
came on as a substitute against QPR in his team's Championship game.

The newspaper claimed that detectives 
were likely to review a yellow card he received for a tackle committed 
in the first half of Blackburn's league game against Ipswich Town last 
Tuesday.

London-born 
Campbell began his League career at Brentford and went on to play in the
Premier League for three clubs - Birmingham, Blackpool and QPR.

He signed for Blackburn Rovers in July after previously joining the club on loan from QPR last February.

One of the suspects was reported to be Sodje's brother Akpo, 33, who plays for Tranmere Rovers.

The League One club said: 'Tranmere Rovers Football Club are aware of Sunday newspaper allegations regarding Akpo Sodje.

'As this is an ongoing investigation, the club will make no further comment at this time.'

Responding
to the claims about Sam Sodje yesterday, Portsmouth FC spokesman Colin 
Farmery said: 'If these serious allegations are true, then we are 
extremely shocked and saddened by them, as match-fixing of any type goes
to the heart of the integrity of the game.

'The
player in question no longer plays for the club and we have not been 
contacted by the authorities, but of course we would co-operate fully 
with any inquiry.'

Oldham 
said in a statement: 'Oldham Athletic Football Club has been made aware 
of the incident and allegation surrounding one of its players, Cristian 
Montano. The club will commence an immediate internal investigation to 
establish all the relevant facts of the case.

'The
club is co-operating with other agencies in this matter and cannot 
comment on specific facts at this stage. The club will not be issuing 
any further statements at this time.'

An
NCA spokeswoman said: 'An active NCA investigation is now under way and
we are working closely with the Football Association and the Gambling 
Commission.'

The NCA is already carrying out a separate investigation into an alleged international illegal betting syndicate.

Michael Boateng and Hakeem Adelakun, both 22, were charged last week with conspiracy to defraud contrary to common law.

The
pair, who played for Conference South club Whitehawk FC in Brighton, will appear in court on Wednesday.

Two
other men, Chann Sankaran, 33, from Hastings, East Sussex, and Krishna 
Sanjey Ganeshan, 43, from Singapore, were charged last month with 
plotting to defraud bookmakers and will also appear in court this week.

Speaking
about the latest reports, Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey 
said: 'We treat any allegations of criminal activity in our competitions
with the utmost seriousness.'

In
a statement, the Football Association said: 'The FA is aware of the 
National Crime Agency investigation and is working closely with the NCA 
and other authorities. We will make no further comment at this time.'

A
Gambling Commission spokesman said: 'The Gambling Commission has 
responded quickly in supporting this ongoing National Crime Agency 
investigation and continues to liaise with both the NCA and the Football
Association.'

The 
Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said: 'These allegations, if
proven, unfortunately demonstrate the real issue football faces in 
terms of corruption and highlights the necessity of the work carried out
by the PFA and other stakeholders in the game in educating players of 
these risks.

'We take the issue of integrity very seriously and will continue in our efforts to eradicate this evil from our game.

'In
terms of these specific reports, due to the ongoing investigation by 
the National Crime Agency, we are unable to comment further at this 
time.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
