Thierry Henry has told French football fans to stop complaining and enjoy Zlatan Ibrahimovic as long as the Swedish striker remains in Ligue 1.

The 33-year-old forward drew criticism for his foul-mouthed outburst, during which he gave a scathing assessment of a referee's performance in Paris Saint-Germain's defeat by Bordeaux and called France 'a s*** country'.

But Henry, who was a team-mate with Ibrahimovic at Barcelona, thinks French fans should cut the Swede some slack. 

'Zlatan is an extraordinary guy. He is incredibly kind and we laughed a lot together,' Henry told L'Equipe .

'The people in France should make up their mind about what they really want. First they were complaining about the lack of big stars in Ligue 1 and now they have a player of Ibrahimovic's stature, they are complaining about him again.

'He is an amazing player, someone really special who has marked an era. He has won league titles wherever he went.

'Of course, he can be quite temperamental. He says what he thinks, but that has never bothered me. There are not a lot of players with his character. People in France should enjoy Ibrahimovic while it lasts.'
