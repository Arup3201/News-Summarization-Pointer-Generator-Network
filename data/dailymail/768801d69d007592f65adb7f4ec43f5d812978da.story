Mo Farah was already celebrating as he broke the tape to become the first British winner of the Great North Run for almost 30 years.

He might have even dipped under the 60min mark were it not for a 'mobot' at the finish.

Training partner Mike Kigen was only a heartbeat behind, but Farah, who had failed to win any of his past three road races, seemed unaware and both recorded one hour dead. The pair, who share a management company, admitted working together during the race but denied Kigen had let his friend win.

The two ran side by side for most of the 13.1 miles from Newcastle to South Shields, with the Kenyan urging Farah on. As they embarked on the final mile Kigen encouraged his training partner.

'He was saying, 'Let's go, let's go',' said Farah. 'We had a chat before the race and I said, 'What we should do is try and go off, leave everybody else and work together to see what we can do'.

'Mike is a great athlete and in great shape. There were a couple of times I was struggling but I managed to get back to him.

'I knew if it came down to the finish I could use my sprint finish but today he actually did test me and I believe he could have run a lot faster if he had people to go with. If it wasn't for how high he thinks of me, he could have really had a go at one point.' This was another historic victory for Farah after a punishing but ultimately victorious year. Road racing, he has admitted, has been more testing than anticipated.

Joy: Farah puts the trophy on top of his head as he recovers from his deflation from the London Marathon

He finished a deflated eighth in the London Marathon. He has also collapsed twice this year, setbacks he admitted gave rise to mental doubts.

'It's been a tough year,' he said, 'but to turn it around is incredible. I've learned you can push your body and do more.'

The 31-year-old was narrowly beaten in a sprint finish on his Great North Run debut last year but said he learned from that defeat. He wore a woollen hat in 2013 but there was no need for headgear this time with barely a cloud in the sky over Tyneside.

The weather was kind and so were the race organisers. Instead of Ethiopia's Kenenisa Bekele, who got the better of him last time, there was his less prolific brother Tariku while London Marathon winner Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda was below his best.

The biggest threat was Kigen who opened a small gap on several occasions but did not extend his lead, even around the 10-mile mark when Farah appeared to be struggling.

There were suggestions that Kigen did not press his advantage. 'My aim was not to give him too much gap and just work,' said Farah, who denied Kigen was slowing to allow him to catch up.

Kigen insisted he gave maximum effort. 'I was slowing because I was tired but the last 400 metres was tough for me,' he said. 'That's why Mo won. I'm happy with second.'

On an historic day for the event, which celebrated an incredible one millionth finisher, Farah broke his own half-marathon national record and became the first British winner since 1985.

The name of Steve Kenyon, who won when Farah was two-years-old, was unknown to yesterday's victor and the only records music fan Kenyon is interested in now are those he sells from his stall in Bolton town centre.

'We haven't had a British winner in 29 years so it's great to change that,' said Farah. 'I didn't know we were so close to going under 60 minutes. The aim was to win the race rather than run a fast time so it's great we did both.'

The reigning Olympic, world and European champion over 5,000m and 10,000m now has his sights on next year's Beijing world championships. But first there is a holiday on Sir Richard Branson's Necker Island. 'It will be nice to have a rest,' said Farah.

In the women's race, Kenyan Mary Keitany won in 1:05.39, breaking Paula Radcliffe's course record set in 2003. Britain's Gemma Steel was second with a personal best of 1:08.13. Shelly Woods won the wheelchair race for the sixth time in 50min 34sec.
