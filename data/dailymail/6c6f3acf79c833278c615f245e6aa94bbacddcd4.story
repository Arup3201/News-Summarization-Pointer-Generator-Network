A military judge will not allow an Army psychiatrist to tell jurors that he shot Fort Hood soldiers to protect Taliban leaders in Afghanistan.

The judge said today that Maj. Nidal Hasan's 'defense of others' strategy fails as a matter of law.

Col. Tara Osborn said no soldiers at the Texas Army post on Nov. 5, 2009, posed an immediate threat to anyone in Afghanistan.

She said the legitimacy of the Afghanistan war is not an issue at Hasan's trial, which hasn't started.

Hasan, 42, is an American-born 
Muslim. He faces the death penalty or life without parole if convicted 
in the rampage that left 13 dead and nearly three dozen wounded.

Hasan is accused of killing 13 people
 and wounding 32 others in an attack on soldiers at a readiness 
facility, many of whom were getting ready to deploy to Iraq or 
Afghanistan.

Maj. Nidal Hasan didn't elaborate 
when he announced his 'defense of others' strategy on June 3, shortly 
after a military judge agreed to allow him to represent himself.

But it was the first time Hasan hinted at his reasoning behind the attack on the Texas Army post.

It was revealed also last month, that Hasan has been paid $278,000 since the shooting on November 5, 2009.

Soldiers injured in the horrific attack at the Texas army base are fighting to receive the same pay and medical benefits as those injured in combat, but the Department of Defense confirmed that Major Nidal Hasan has continued to be paid.

The Army said that under the Military Code of Justice, unless Hasan is found guilty, his salary cannot be suspended.
