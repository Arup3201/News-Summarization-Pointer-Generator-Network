Britain will be blanketed in up to three inches of snow in the coming days as the latest band of wintry showers sweep across the country.

Forecasters are predicting the snow for central and southern England as a weather front moves in from the North West.

Up to three inches of snow are expected to fall this evening on the Midlands, Lincolnshire and East Anglia. London, the South and parts of Yorkshire are due to get up to 1.5inches.

Temperatures will plunge as low as 
minus 7c (19f) in central and eastern England tomorrow night, and 
daytime levels will struggle to rise above minus 1c (30f) in some parts 
of the country.

Forecasters are warning that low temperatures will cause a ‘slow thaw’ leaving the snow on the ground well into the weekend.

The cold snap is expected to have 
relaxed its grip by Sunday, although night-time temperatures will still 
fall below zero in parts of England into next week.

Despite freezing conditions over most of England, much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are experiencing milder weather.

Today is expected to be dry and bright
in most parts of England and Wales but temperatures are only 
expected to rise to around 3C.

Tim Hewson, chief forecaster at the Met Office said: 'We are expecting snow across parts of the country later tomorrow and Friday. However, the Atlantic weather system bringing the mix of rain, sleet and snow is due to stall over the UK and we find ourselves in the battleground Britain scenario once again.

'Whilst there is uncertainty regarding where the heaviest and most persistent snow will fall, accumulations of up to about 10cm are possible in the worst affected regions. As a result there could be some disruption to travel.'

The freezing temperatures have also brought tragedy.

It has emerged that a man died after he jumped in a freezing pond to save his dog over the weekend.

The body of Tim Waddingham, 53, was 
found in a pond near the Wildwood Golf and Country Club in Cranleigh, 
Surrey, on Sunday afternoon.

Mr Waddington, a classic car restoration expert from Rudgwick, in West 
Sussex, was overcome by the cold and drowned - while his pet dog 
managed to scramble free.

The areas worst hit with snow are expected to be 
East Anglia and the Midlands with southern areas of England set to 
experience a light dusting. The north and west will be milder and could have rain.

The adverse weather conditions have seen the Met Office issue a level-three severe cold weather alert lasting until Friday.

Victoria Kettley, forecaster for MeteoGroup said there was still some uncertainly over exactly how much snow will fall.

She
said: ‘Scotland and Northern Ireland will see a front move in during 
today which could bring some snow in western Scotland - possibly a 
couple of centimetres on higher ground.

‘It
will push south east overnight and edge into Northumberland and Cumbria
by tomorrow morning. There could be rain, sleet and snow on high ground
as the leading edge of the front pushes through, as well as the risk of
freezing rain.’

Ms 
Kettley predicted the weather system would continue to push southwards 
during today before finally reaching the South East on Friday.

‘Some
weather models are showing significant snow for the Midlands of up to 
6cm on Friday, but it is uncertain if the precipitation the front is 
bringing will fall as rain, sleet, or snow,’ she added.

However, as the front passes over the UK bringing the unsettled weather, temperatures are expected to show a slight increase.

It warns: ‘There is a 100 per cent probability of severe cold weather and icy conditions until 10am on Friday in parts of England. This weather could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients.’

Meanwhile severe ‘yellow’ weather 
warnings, instructing the public to be aware of icy roads, remains in 
place in London and the South East, the East, the South West, the 
Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber and North East England.

Drivers have been reminded that roads will still pose a risk even if the temperatures begin to warm.

MeteoGroup
forecaster Nick Prebble said: ‘Road temperatures in winter can be a 
couple of degrees centigrade lower than the air temperature, so there’s 
still a risk of ice on the roads over the weekend and potentially into 
next week.’

The thick 
blanket of snow that fell over parts of the UK at the weekend caused 
major travel disruption with a spike in road crashes and breakdowns.

A
handful of schools were also forced to close due to the adverse weather
conditions, while Heathrow Airport axed half of all flights on Sunday 
night.

Joshua’s father Jeff said the boy had epilepsy when he was younger and doctors believe he may have had a fit. School friends built a snowman in honour of Joshua.

The body of a man in his 50s who is believed to have frozen to death was found in a park in Hull on Monday. The overnight temperature was minus 7c (19f).
