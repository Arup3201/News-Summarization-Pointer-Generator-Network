A Mexican metro driver has been caught on video playing FarmVille on his tablet computer while at the controls of a train.

Passenger Carlo Segura Linares took the video, which shows the train driver playing the game while driving through Mexico City, on his mobile phone after getting on to the train.

The video, which has now been posted online, shows the man playing the game between the stations of Cuatro Caminos and Tasquena in the Mexican capital.

Mr Linares said: 'I couldn't believe it when I got onto the train and saw this guy that was supposed to be driving playing Farmville on his tablet.

'I grabbed my phone straightaway because I knew no one would believe me, and I wanted to make sure everybody realised how we were putting lives at risk with idiots like this.'

In a message alongside the video posted online, Mr Linares wrote: 'Look at this, this is our security, this is our safety in the hands of this idiot who feels he would rather play Farmville.

'Can you believe it? I wonder what his bosses will say when they see it on Facebook.'

Mr Linares said he was most shocked when the driver appeared to shut the doors only to open them again a short while later, which allowed him to continue playing the game uninterrupted for a few more seconds.

The driver has now been suspended after the video was widely shared on social media.

The company issued a statement on its website which read: 'With regards to the video currently circulating on social media networks showing a driver at work, we can confirm that proceedings have been started and he is currently suspended.

'The driver was not matching the standards we regard as acceptable, or following the guidelines as laid down in our manuals and protocols for staff working in the public transport system.'

The Mexico City Metro is one of the 
largest underground systems in the world. In 2012, the system served 
1.609 billion passengers, placing it as the metro with the eighth 
highest number of passengers.

FarmVille is an interactive online game which requires people to harvest fruits, vegetables and raise animals on a virtual farm

FarmVille is an online game where the primary aim is to become an agricultural entrepreneur.

Starting
 with an empty farm and a fixed amount of 'farm coins', each player sets
 about earning points by ploughing land or buying items.

Virtual cash is earned as the player progresses through the game's levels, and by trading crops and animals on the market.

Although FarmVille can be played for free, a small proportion of players spend real money to make virtual purchases.

In 2011, at the height of the game's popularity, its maker Zynga was valued at between £4.4billion and £5.6billion.

The company at the time was just three years old.
