A former judge has appeared in court for breaching the rules of a restraining order by sending ''threatening and abusive' text messages to his ex-wife.

Lincoln Crawford OBE is also accused of breaking the rules of the order imposed in 2006 by contacting his ex-wife via letter and email.

Last week he denied harassment in breach of a restraining order, and will appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on December 3.

Former Judge Lincoln Crawford is accused of breaching a restraining order imposed by a judge in 2006

Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court heard that the 66-year-old sent 'numerous' messages to mother of his children between February and July this year.

Seven years ago the former judge received an 18-month conditional discharge after allegedly stalking Bronwen Jenkins and her partner.

Crawford persuaded JPs to impose an order banning the press from identifying him, a ruling that was overturned by the High Court in 2008.

Following his 2005 charge, the former judge continued working as a Recorder and was paid up to Â£500 a day until the court case in February 2006.

Crawford came to Britain immigrated from Trinidad aged 18, and worked as a security guard to fund his studies before qualifying as a lawyer and being called to the Bar in 1977.

He was awarded the OBE in 1998 and earned a string of public appointments including at the Parole Board, the Prince's Trust, the Independent Adoption Service and Commission for Racial Equality.
