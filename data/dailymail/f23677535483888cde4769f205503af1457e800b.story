It might be the happiest place on earth, but your wallet won't be feeling any happier after splashing out even more to 'experience the magic' of Disney.

The cost of going to the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World just got more expensive.

Although Disney won't specify the reasons behind the increase, the Florida parks are home to the 
company's new high-tech wristband-based ticketing and ride reservation 
system, called MyMagic+ which cost the company $1.5 billion.

Better start saving: The price of a one-day ticket to Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom is now $99. That's a $4 increase from the previous price hike announced in June 2013. The price hike went into effect Sunday

Extra costs: MyMagic+, includes wristbands, dubbed MagicBands, which are outfitted with radio-frequency identification chips that interact with scanners throughout the park

Known as MagicBands, they function as all-in-one theme-park tickets, hotel-room keys and credit cards.

The bracelets allow reservations to be made for individual rides to be made from home for as many as three attractions a day in a single theme park — or four in the Magic Kingdom.

MyMagic+, which Disney began developing more than five years ago cost close to $1.5 billion according to the Orlando Sentinel and is likely to be a major factor behind this weeks price increase.

Disney expects to recoup the large 
investment by encouraging guests to spend more on things like souvenirs 
and foods and by getting them to spend longer in the parks.

Is it worth it? Walt Disney Co. faces growing questions from Wall Street about when the company will see financial returns from the sweeping technology project, which Disney hopes will ultimately get visitors planning more of their vacations in advance and spending more time and money on its property

How it works: MyMagic+ is designed to allow visitors to book ride times weeks before their vacations, and the MagicBands act as all-in-one park tickets, room keys and credit cards

By collecting more personal data about visitors, from their favorite characters to their spending habits, Disney hopes to develop more effective sales offers customized for individual families.

Not only did the annual increase on admission take place earlier than expected, but the news was quietly released less than 24 hours before the changes took effect.

Previously, Disney has announced such information on its official blog.

The price increase also comes shortly before Magic Kingdom will complete its New Fantasyland expansion by opening of the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train; that opening will occur in time for early summer crowds.

Disney World has raised the one-day ticket price to the Magic Kingdom by $4 so that it now costs $99 before taxes for visitors over age 9.

Costly: Some analysts estimate that Disney has spent more than $1 billion on MyMagic+, which Disney once hoped to have fully launched last year

Single-day tickets for the resort's other parks — Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom — also went up by $4. It now costs $94 to get into those parks for visitors over age 9.

For children under age 10, the cost is $93 to get into the Magic Kingdom and $88 to enter the other parks.

Disney spokeswoman Kim Prunty says the pricing reflects the high quality of the parks.

She also says that most guests buy multi-day tickets, which are considerably cheaper per day

This is the second price hike in less than a year.

'It's all about supply and demand,' writes Deb Wills, editor-in-chief of AllEars.net, an unofficial Disney planning and fan site. 'Attendance is going up, not down; so as long as people keep paying the prices, Disney (any business) will keep raising them.'

Magic Kingdom: While last year's price hikes hit visitors to Walt Disney World as well as Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure in Anaheim, the latest increase appears confined to Florida

The prices are hard to swallow  especially may be a bit hard to swallow, since Disney posted record profits during its previous fiscal quarter. It’s also hard for families, since they also have to pay for high-priced food and expensive souvenirs.

Universal Orlando also raised its prices last summer where a one-day, one-park ticket is $92.
