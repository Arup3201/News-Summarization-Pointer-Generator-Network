Cash-strapped Britons are throwing children's birthday parties costing up to Â£500 because of pressure to impress other parents, a report has found.

Research shows nearly half (41 per cent) of parents are really too hard-up to give their children a birthday party.

But more than a quarter (27 per cent) are still driven to organise one because of 'playground peer pressure' among parents, as well as friends and family.

And more than a third (36 per cent) are splashing out between 80 pounds and a staggering 500 pounds per party in a bid to impress their guests.

The report also found the trend for taking cakes and party bags into school for classmates is piling even more pressure on parents' already low incomes.

It means 46 per cent of hard-hit families are forced to start saving more than a month in advance of their children's birthday.

Others have to prepare for the big day by slashing household costs (21 per cent) or going without new clothes for themselves and their children (27 per cent).

The pressure to take elaborate cakes in to school for classmates is adding to the stress levels of parents

Family support service leaders Family Action surveyed 2,052 adults for the Birthdays on the Breadline report.

Chief executive David Holmes said: 'Paying for children's parties is clearly causing financial stress for many families, even before the costs of birthday presents are taken into account.

'This stress is magnified for low income families who may find themselves spending the equivalent of a week's living costs for the whole family on a party for a single child.

'If you then add the extra financial pressures low income families in particular face from low wage rises and the squeeze on welfare, paying for children's parties is no cause for celebration.

'Money management programmes such as Money for Life help make parents more resilient to social and financial pressures by building their self-esteem and money skills.'

The report is released in partnership with Lloyds Banking Group's Money for Life programme, which focuses on the importance money management.

A spokesman added: 'This report shows money management is an increasingly vital life skill with families facing all sorts of unexpected financial pressures.'
