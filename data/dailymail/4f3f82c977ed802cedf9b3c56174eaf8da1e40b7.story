Neymar insists his head was never turned by Manchester City's interest in him before signing for Barcelona from Santos in June 2013.

Neymar's signature had been coveted from teams across Europe and City led the way from England but ahead of the  Champions League second leg clash at the Nou Camp between the two teams, the Brazil striker is adamant only one side interested him.

‘Barcelona was the only club I ever wanted to join,' Neymar said. 'I knew that Manchester City had interest in me, but I never had any intention to join them.

'I am sure that I could have got a bigger contract and more money there - but we never even got that far - when a club with the history and tradition of Barcelona want you then you don't listen to anybody else.'

Barcelona hold a 2-1 advantage from the first leg of their Champions League tie against City, with both goals coming from Luis Suarez at the Etihad.

Luis Enrique's side could have had an even greater lead had Lionel Messi not missed a penalty in the latter stages of the game and Neymar warned City his team know their advantage is far from secure.

He also rejected claims that it is a good time to take on City after their 1-0 defeat in the Premier League to Burnley on Saturday.

Neymar rejected talk that it could be a good time to play City due to their recent patchy form in England

‘We got a good result in Manchester, but the job is not done,' Neymar said. 'Yes we have put ourselves in a strong position, but we know Manchester City can score goals. 

'They might not be on their best form in England, but teams raise their game for Barcelona and we must be careful of that.'
