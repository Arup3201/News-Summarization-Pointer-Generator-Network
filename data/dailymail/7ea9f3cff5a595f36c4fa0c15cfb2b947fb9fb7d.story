Classy? Anthony Bourdain originally laid into the New Mexico treat called Frito Pie but has since apologized for the toilet humor he used to describe it

After enraging the entire state of New Mexico by ridiculing one of its favorite dishes, TV chef Anthony Bourdain has turned heel and apologized for his sharp-tongued comments.

The chef and writer used toilet humor to describe the snacks sold at Santa Fe's famous Five & Dime General Store's on a recent episode of his show Parts Unknown. He now says he 'got it wrong.'

'It may have felt like s*** but was shockingly tasty,' Bourdain said.

A spokesperson for the controversial chef said the comments would be edited out.

'He admits that "we got it wrong" about the chile,' Reynolds said in an email. 'And we'll try to correct it for future airings.'

A Frito pie consists of a bag of Fritos which then has chili and cheese mixed in with it.

Bourdain described the western delicacy as ‘feeling like holding a warm crap in a bag’ and ‘colostomy pie.’

The
store manager of the Five & Dime where Bourdain ate wasn't happy 
after the celebrity chef was so quick to dismiss his food.

Bourdain
had described the dish as tasting as if it were made with canned Hormel
Chili and a ‘day-glow orange cheese-like substance.’

Mike
Collins said Bourdain is 'completely wrong' about the store's Frito 
pie, which he says is homemade from chile grown in New Mexico and 
remains extremely popular with his customers.

Bourdain also upset locals by claiming that the local dish wasn't even a New Mexico meal, but rather a Texas creation.

He said the New Mexicans should have left the recipe to the Texans, although he also admitted that it was delicious.

In the CNN documentary series ‘Anthony 
Bourdain: Parts Unknown’ the chef travels the world on a mission to 
discover regional flavors, with a dash of geopolitical insight.

The show gave CNN its first Primetime Emmys when it won for outstanding informational series and outstanding cinematography for a nonfiction series at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards on Sept. 15.

In the episode on New Mexico, Bourdain took a close look at the mash-up of cultures that comprise the state's food - a combination of Spanish, Mediterranean, Mexican, Pueblo and even chuck-wagon influences.
