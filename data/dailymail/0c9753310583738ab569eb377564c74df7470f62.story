Ministers should spend up to £1billion of taxpayers’ money to persuade lonely older people to use the internet, an influential think-tank said yesterday.

Encouraging the elderly to log on would ease the isolation of those who live alone while saving many millions for the NHS and in state-subsidised care home places, according to the Policy Exchange.

The cost of internet education for the more than six million people who do not know how to use it would amount to £875million – or £141 each – said the think-tank, which has close links to David Cameron. But the savings would be almost double that.

At present, four in ten over-65s do not have access to the internet. The report said everyone in Britain should have the skills and confidence to go online by 2020.

It added that one in ten patients who visit their GP do so because they are lonely rather than due to illness. Isolated people are more likely to need emergency hospital beds or admission to care homes.

The number of people aged 85 or over is set to double in the next 20 years, with many living hundreds of miles from family members.

Report author Eddie Copeland said: ‘In an increasingly isolated and fast moving world it is vital that everyone in society is able to use the internet and understand its benefits.

‘From alleviating social isolation, bringing together communities, paying bills and now accessing public services, online can improve lives.’

He added: ‘Being able to simply write an email or access a social networking site could provide older people with a way to stay connected to their friends and families, who may live hundreds of miles away.

‘Maintaining these important relationships will help an ageing society vulnerable to loneliness.'

Some 29 per cent of people over 65 have still never used the internet, according to figures by the Office for National Statistics issued in the first quarter of this year.

Among over-75s nearly two in three, three million people, have never used the internet.
