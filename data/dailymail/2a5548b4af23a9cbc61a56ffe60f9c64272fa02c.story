David Cameron has pledged to offer MPs a vote on repealing the fox hunting ban if he wins the election and declared that he has the ‘countryside in my blood’.

In an article for the Countryside Alliance magazine the Prime Minister makes a direct pitch to rural voters, insisting he understands their concerns and is proud of the country’s ‘rural identity’.

He also points to his own ‘rural heritage’ and writes of feeling ‘most at home’ in the countryside, enjoying country walks and bike rides with his family and feeding the animals ‘at the next door farm’.

The Prime Minister - at a hat factory in his Witney constituency today - has made a direct pitch to rural voters, insisting he understands their concerns and is proud of the country’s ‘rural identity’

And he says he makes political decisions ‘while tending my muddy veg patch.’

Mr Cameron says there is a ‘rural way of life which a born and bred Londoner might struggle to understand’ and spells out his personal opposition to the hunting ban.

‘I have always been a strong supporter of country sports. It is my firm belief that people should have the freedom to hunt, so I share the frustration that many people feel about the Hunting Act and the way it was brought in by the last government.’

‘The Hunting Act has done nothing for animal welfare. A Conservative government will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal the Hunting Act on a free vote, with a government bill in government time.’

The pledge mirrors that made in the last Tory manifesto in 2010. Early last year, Mr Cameron admitted he had been forced to abandon any attempt to relax the law on hunting with dogs.

The Lib Dems opposed the change as did a small number of Tory MPs known as ‘Blue Foxes’. Ministers concluded that any vote would likely to fail in the Commons and so set back the cause. Hunting foxes and other wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales was banned by Labour in 2004.

In the article, Mr Cameron says he feels most at home in the countryside having been brought up in the village of Peasemore in Berkshire.

He says he feels a ‘noticeable emotional shift’ when he arrives in his West Oxfordshire constituency on Friday after a week in London.

‘We spend a lot of time outdoors as a family: walking, running, gardening, cycling and riding. We all help feed the animals at the next door farm and eagerly anticipate lambing time each year. Decisions get mulled over while tending my muddy veg patch.’

And he writes of his family’s ‘annual pilgrimage’ to North Cornwall ‘a place I’ve been going to even since I was a child’.

‘It feels only right that Truro hospital was where our youngest daughter, Florence, was born, cementing Cornwall in our family history.’

‘Walking the coastal paths, fishing off the Doom Bar at low tide, or having a barbecue at Daymer Bay, looking across the estuary towards Padstow: this is the stuff that memories are made of.’

The Tories are hopeful of picking up several seats in the South West of England from the Lib Dems.

Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘With Britain facing a cost-of-living crisis because of his failing plan, David Cameron’s continued focus on fox hunting shows how out of touch he is.

‘The Tories should get over their narrow obsession with fox hunting and accept that Labour’s ban is widely supported.’

Tim Bonner, director of campaigns for the Countryside Alliance, said: ‘The Hunting Act has failed and there is a clear need to revisit it, so we welcome David Cameron's pledge of a free vote on its repeal.’

Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports said: ‘The Hunting Act is a testimony to the fact that we are a nation of animal lovers and we have an international reputation for our hatred of cruelty in the name of sport.’
