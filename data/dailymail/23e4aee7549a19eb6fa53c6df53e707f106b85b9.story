Abercrombie & Fitch's longtime CEO Michael Jeffries is retiring, effective immediately, as the once-hip teen clothing chain's sales continue to decline.

Jeffries, 70, is also retiring from the retailer's board of directors. He has served as CEO since February 1992, according to CapitalIQ.

'I believe now is the right time for new leadership to take the company forward in the next phase of its development,' Jeffries said in a statement.

Abercrombie & Fitch's sales have slumped as its target shoppers have turned to the runway-inspired styles of fast-fashion brands such as H&M, Zara and Forever 21.

The company has even worked on stripping its once-prized Abercrombie logo off products as teens are now seeking more individuality in their clothing.

For the fall season, the company reduced its logoed merchandise by half and previously announced plans to try and have a very minimal North American logo business in the spring.

In another bid to boost its image, the company recently launched its first collection featuring the color black, which Jeffries had previously banned, deeming it too 'formal.' 

The brand has also suffered due to criticism of its policy of not carrying women's clothing in XL or XXL sizes and for controversial comments Mr Jeffries made in 2006, which resurfaced last year.

'In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,' he told Salon at the time.

'Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.'

He added: 'Those companies that are in trouble are trying to target everybody: young, old, fat, skinny.'

Abercrombie & Fitch has taken other measures to alter its reputation this year.

In May, the company announced that it would ease up on the fragrance that is sprayed throughout the stores and get rid of the heavy, daylight-obscuring shutters on the windows in 240 stores around the U.S. 

Abercrombie & Fitch has also increased its emphasis on online shopping as it looks to reshape itself.

In other moves, the chain said that current Non-Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez will become executive chairman. He has served as non-executive chairman since January.

Abercrombie & Fitch Co. also said that its board has created an Office of the Chairman that will include Martinez, Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Ramsden, Christos Angelides, Brand President of Abercrombie & Fitch and Fran Horowitz, Brand President of Hollister.

The Office of the Chairman will be led by Martinez and will oversee Abercrombie & Fitch's strategic direction. It will also be responsible for managing the company's day-to-day operations until a new CEO is appointed.

The retailer - whose brands include abercrombie, Hollister Co. Gilly Hicks and its namesake - said that it has started a search for a new CEO.

Abercrombie & Fitch had 834 stores in the U.S. and 166 stores across Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East at the third quarter's end.

Shares of the New Albany, Ohio-based company rose 6.7 per cent in Tuesday premarket trading.
