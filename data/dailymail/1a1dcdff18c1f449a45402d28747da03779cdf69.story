Thousands of people have once again leveled contempt at polarizing Texas cheerleader Kendall Jones over an online competition she set up to find the 'hottest' male hunter.

The 19-year-old - who has been bombarded with death threats and hate from all over the world due to her proud Facebook posts about killing rare and exotic animals - said that she received over 3,000 submissions for the contest and personally decided upon an 'American Idol-style Top 12'.

But it wasn't the nominees or even the winner - North Carolina's Trey Moore - that people cared about, and rather the fact Jones was once again celebrating the slaughter of animals in the name of sport.

'(Applause) for the day your gun fails and the lion tears u apart,' one furious critic, Paul Norton, posted to Jones' Facebook page.

Packing heat: Kendall Jones, 19, has only further incensed her detractors by starting up a search for the hottest hunter

'Sick and ignorant': Critics say such a competition is nothing but a celebration of slaughtering animals for fun

Big game: Most of the nominees are seen pictured with the rare animals they have shot dead

Winner: Trey Moore, from North Carolina, was voted in as the winner of Hot Hunter 2014

Kendall Jones wrote in announcing Trey Moore as winner: 'Congrats Trey and good luck hunting in 2015!!'

Stiff competition: Over 3,000 men are said to have applied to be part of the search

Fair game: While some animals are common for hunting, like deer, others are more exotic

Hot hunters: Jones later revealed her real inspiration for starting the contest

Jones, a cheerleader at Texas Tech, claims her motivation for initiating the competition was to expose the sexism she has suffered.

'The real reason I did this whole competition was to prove that what really pisses off  the anti-hunting crowd is not that I hunt, or that I pose with my trophies, or that I'm proud of my achievements ... its the fact that I'm a girl and I'm doing those things,' she wrote.

'Well I'm here to tell you, I'm NEVER going to stop. 

'I'm proud to hunt, proud to cheer, proud to wear makeup, and especially PROUD TO BE ME!'

However this seemed to only further infuriate her detractors. 

Facebook user Calvin Fox wrote: 'Let's hunt you for your blonde locks they would look so much better on my head than yours!!'

Jennifer Skean added: 'You may love your makeup but it doesn't hide the monster you are.'

Bianca Dye wrote: 'You are DISGUSTING!' 

'American Idol-style': Jones narrowed nominees down to this Top 12

Hate: Scores of photos like this are being circulated online by critics of Jones, who they call a monster

While many flared up against Jones, others, many of whom said they were hunters, took a more diplomatic approach.

'I don't care the slightest bit that you're a women. I'm just an average guy who cares about the fact that you're just willing to kill an animal that just simply doesn't need to be killed,' wrote one man, Matt Phillips.

'I do understand that ppl r going to kill chickens, cows, and a few other things to keep our society flowing. I understand that hunting deer is acceptable. but do you really need to kill a lion/cheetah?'

Another man, Rick Nally, took a similar approach, but was just as outraged.

'I am a hunter have been since I could tote a Daisy BB gun,' he wrote.

'I truly believe these people will have to answer to the man above for killing these beautiful creatures.....I was taught if you ain't going to eat it, don't shoot it, unless you are protecting yourself.....what warped pleasure would you get from killing these beautiful cats? or an elephant, rhino.....etc?'

Chris Seilhamer added: 'I don't care that you hunt... but do it because you'll use the meat... not for pure sport. You're also killing endangered animals. You're not a hunter... you're an idiot and a complete douche for enticing people and being antagonistic.'

Jones has long maintained that she is careful to only hunt in areas where it is legal and many of her pictures have been taken on safari trips in Africa.

Her and her family claim to give the meat from their kill to local villages.

Gone: Facebook has also removed this image of her with an elephant. It said it removes 'content that promotes poaching of endangered species... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse'

'[Roosevelt]
 was a hunter too, right? He killed the same species that hunters now 
chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure.

'Yet,
 how can it be possible that someone can love the earth, and take from 
the Earth in the name of conservation? For some folks, they'll never 
understand. For the rest of us...we were born that way. God Bless 
Teddy,' wrote Jones.

Jones, whose Facebook indicates

 she 'is looking to host a TV show in January 2015,' said here isn't 
always space for threatened species like elephants or lions.

'Controlling the male lion population 
is important within large fenced areas like these,' Jones writes.

'Funds
 from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but 
also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their 
property.'

Big 5: Jones says her first kill was a rare African white rhino, part of her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (rhino, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and lion)

Legal: The young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she's doing is fine, since she pays the governments of African countries to kill the animals

Jones' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras, hugging a dead leopard, and smiling beside elephants she had killed.

One
 particular photo, in which she posed alongside an extremely 
endangered rhinoceros, had her critics especially steaming, but the 
Texas Tech cheerleader says it was alive and well.

'The
 vet drew blood, took DNA samples, took body and head measurements, 
treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics. I felt very lucky to 
be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the White Rhino
 population through conservation,' she wrote.

However,
 Jones has in her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (lion, 
elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros) shot a 
white rhino, which number around 20,000.

Because
 of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her 
dubious standing as a conservationist, some critics say Jones should be 
banned from hunting in Africa completely.

Pride: Jones learned how to hunt after she went with her father to Africa for his own hunts at age 9

'Cruelty': Critics say she is not 
a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures

Boasts: 'This time I got my leopard,' she wrote a safari when she was 14.  'And also took down a hippo'

A second petition, this one on change.org and originating from South Africa, is hoping to do just that.

'Kendall
 Jones is an American born hunter who has entered the continent and has 
been hunting African wildlife under the facade of conservation,' reads 
the petition.

It 
continues: 'She has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television 
hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless African animals as
 a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms.'

But she also has her supporters. A Facebook account, Support Kendall Jones, has also started.

'Support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in Africa,' reads the page.
