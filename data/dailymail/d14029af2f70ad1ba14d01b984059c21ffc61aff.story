The world's oldest living man resides in New York City - and says it runs in the family.

Alexander Imich, 111, lives in the Upper West Side. He received the Guinness World Record after Italian man Arturo Licata died before his 112th birthday, according to data collected by the Gerontology Research Group.

In a video interview with Reuters, Imich simply credited his long lifespan to 'good genes.'

Imich has also suggested that it may be because he and his wife never had any children during their marriage.

That's the secret! Imich said 'My father lived to his 90s, so I got good genes and was living a hygienic life too'

Long life: Dr. Alexander Imich, pictured, was born on February 4, 1903

'My father lived to his 90s, so I got good genes and was living a hygienic life too.'

Imich also alluded to having other aspirations.

'There are things I would like to achieve,' he said. 'But I'm not quite clear about what and how.'

Speaking to NBC 4, Imich expressed shock at receiving the record.

He said: 'I have no idea how this happened.'

Imich was born in Poland on February 4, 1903.

Though a New York Times report details how Imich experienced anti-Semitism while pursuing a career, he eventually studied chemistry and later parapsychology.

Not the oldest! Though Dr. Alexander Imich may be the world's oldest living man, there are 66 women in the world older than him

That report said Imich 'participated in numerous inexplicable encounters' after he became interested in a Polish medium and eventually published 'Incredible Tales of the Paranormal' at age 92.

He emigrated to the U.S in 1951 with his wife Wela and settled in Connecticut, the paper says, and moved to New York after her death in 1986.

Speaking to the Times, Imich listed some other possible reasons for his lifespan.They included not having children, participating in athletics, and abstaining from alcohol.

Though Imich may be the world's oldest living man, there are 66 women in the world older than him, according to the Gerontology Research Group's data, with the oldest being 116-year-old Misao Okawa.
