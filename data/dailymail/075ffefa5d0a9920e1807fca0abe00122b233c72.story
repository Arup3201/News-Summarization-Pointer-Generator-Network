A retired Maine couple has won the state lottery after the same numbers they have played for decades were once drawn before - but they forgot to buy a ticket.

Jeanne Gagnon, 66, of St David, finally struck it rich after winning the February 19 Megabucks jackpot worth $3million, and husband Robert, 67, is finally out of the dog house.

‘I had all the numbers, Jeanne Gagnon told the Bangor Daily News. ‘But my husband forgot to pick up a ticket that day.’

Winners!: Jeanne and Robert Gagnon finally won the lottery 37 years after their numbers were first drawn

‘And I’ve been hearing about it ever since,’ Robert Gagnon told the paper while shaking his head.

The couple has been playing the same numbers – 2, 4, 11, 17, 18, 28 – since the lottery began in 1985, and Jeanne Gagnon has even kept lottery numbers taped inside her ‘lottery wallet’ since then.

She could not believe her eyes when her son gave her the winning numbers.

‘Two weeks ago he gave me a piece of paper with the numbers and I said, ‘Are you kidding? I think we have it,’ she recalled to the paper.

Her husband of 47 years had already gone to bed for the evening, but the son insisted she wake him to share the good news.

The excited couple went to the local deli where they have always bought their tickets to claim the prize bright and early the following morning, but were told they would have to go to state capitol Augusta for an official claim.

After 27 years, they were forced to wait several more days after a high school basketball tournament claimed all the hotel rooms in the small town, and a vicious ice storm crippled local travel.

Avid players: Jeanne Gagnon said she plans to keep playing the lottery because 'you can't win if you don't play'

Robert Gagnon was undeterred though, and even suggested they both go down and sleep in their truck.

‘She did not want that,’ he said.

She also did not want a lump sum.

‘If we had taken the lump sum we would have lost $700,000 right off to taxes,’ said Jeanne Gagnon. ‘I wasn’t having that.’

The pair opted for annual payments totalling $70,000 each, which will be set aside into an estate that ensures their disabled son is always taken care of, she explained.

The only new toys the retirees expect to buy are a tractor-powered snowblower and new garage to house it in, they said.

They also plan to keep playing the lottery, Jeanne Gagnon told the St. John Valley Times.‘You can't win if you don't play.’
