In what was described as a victory against art 'snobbery', 80 pieces of his work - including eight rarely unseen landscapes - will be displayed at the Tate Britain in June.

Lowry is loved for his ‘matchstick men’ depictions of everyday life in North of England in the first half of 20th-century Britain.

But a major retrospective of his work has not been shown in the capital since his death in 1976.

Lowry's The Football Match is a typical example of the artist's depictions of everyday life in the north of England

His art has previously been dismissed as
the work of a ‘Sunday painter’ by high-brow critics, with some saying 
he could ‘barely paint’.

The Tate holds 23 Lowry pieces - 16 paper drawings are readily available to visitors but only one painting, Industrial Landscape (1955), has been on display in London in the past 20 years.

The gallery has previously been criticised by actor Sir Ian McKellen and Oasis star Noel Gallagher for being biased against the Lancaster-born artist.

Sir Ian told a 2011 documentary it was ‘a shame, verging on the iniquitous, that foreign visitors to London shouldn’t have access to the painter English people like more than most others’.

In the same film, artist Dame Paula Rego described reaction to him as ‘a great snobbery’.

Yesterday Art historians TJ Clark and Anne Wagner, who worked on the exhibition, said it was time to ‘reassess’ Lowry’s place in British art.

Mr Clark said: ‘It is absolutely extraordinary to me that the image of him as an amateur, as truly someone who could barely paint, just won’t die.

‘Coded into that is a deep conviction of the metropolitan elite that someone who spends their life painting that subject matter can’t be taken seriously.’

Tate Britain Director Penelope Curtis said the exhibition would be ‘serious, authentic and not cynical’ and Lowry needed to be ‘reconciled to art history’.

Sir Ian would be invited to the opening, she added.

The artist’s painting of Piccadilly Circus in London sold for £5.6million at Christie’s in November 2011.
