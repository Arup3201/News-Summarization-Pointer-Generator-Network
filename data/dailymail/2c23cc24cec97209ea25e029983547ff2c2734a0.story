A proposal is typically a private and emotional moment, with a very nervous man tentatively asking his partner for her hand in marriage.

But one man decided to buck the stereotype by proposing to his girlfriend in front of thousands - and over Twitter.

Curt Buthman, from Los Angeles, uploaded a short video of him asking his partner Marsha Collier to marry him while she conducted an online discussion with Twitter users about customer service.

'Please?' Curt Buthman took to Twitter to pop the question to his girlfriend of two years, Marsha Collier

Marsha Collier was shocked when her boyfriend used Vine to propose to her - and promised to share the wedding on Twitter

The creative consultant's Vine clip - an app that allows users to upload videos of up to six seconds - certainly caught her attention and her heart, and she immediately accepted his very modern proposal.

When she was bombarded with the 
question she initially tweeted: 'Um, wow!! OMG RT @curtbuthman: 
@marshacollier I love you! #WillYouMarryMe <3 #custserv'

But then the LA businesswoman quickly accepted his 
proposal, writing: 'Um, uh, YES @curtbuthman - I will MARRY YOU! 
#custserv' - much to the delight of her audience.

The loved-up pair made sure to use 
the hashtag #custserv, which brought it to the attention of anyone who 
wanted to take part in the regular online conversation about customer 
service.

But this soon changed to #WillYouMarryMe as users celebrated the unconventional engagement.

The daughter of Marsha Collier seemed unsurprised - but delighted - that her mother would get engaged using technology

Ms Collier, author of the For Dummies series on eBay and eCommerce, was flooded with congratulations from her 70,000 followers, while many applauded her fiance for his bold move.

She then apologised to her Twitter users for interrupting the scheduled online chat, saying that her new fiance had brought in the ring - which was a family heirloom - into her office.

The couple, who have been together 
for two years, celebrated with pizza and promised that there impending 
wedding would include her Twitter followers too.

As users begged her to live stream their future nuptials, she wrote: 'Whatever we do - the wedding will be on Twitter somehow!'

A Twitter user called Susan Dickman, 
who appeared to be the daughter of Ms Collier, wrote: 'My mother would 
get engaged over Twitter!' before welcoming her stepfather into the 
family.

Twitter users exploded with joy about the surprise question.

One called Shauna Shines wrote: 'Romance isn't dead, it's on Twitter!' while another called StereotypeSteve wrote: 'Social media changing the world! Love anywhere can happen. And that is pretty dope. Weird to some. Awesome to me.'

Ms Collier, an avid Twitter fan, seemed 
to approve of the unique method of proposing, tweeting that the question
 brought a whole new meaning to 'social media engagement'.

Their engagement is not the first to happen over social media.

DJ Deadmau5, real name Joel Thomas Zimmerman, asked girlfriend and tattoo-artist Kat Von D, to marry him over the social media site in December.

The celebrity tattoo artist very proudly accepted her 31-year-old boyfriend's proposal after he wrote:

'I can't wait for Christmas so.... Katherine Von Drachenberg, will you marry me?'

He posted a picture of the ring, a diamond flanked by two skulls which is being customised for his bride-to-be

Kat, 30, promptly tweeted in response: 'Mi corazon! Thank you all for the lovely congratulations! Please excuse me while I go squeeze the hell out of my fiance!'
