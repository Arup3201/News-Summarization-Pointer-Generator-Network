A teenager has been jailed for life after he stabbed a man to death outside an off licence in a row over a cigarette.

Kai Steele, 18, was found guilty of murdering 26-year-old Alex Scott after he stabbed him twice in the chest when an argument erupted in an alleyway in south-east London last year.

Mr Scott had been on a night out with friends, where they had spent the early evening drinking and gambling, before making their way to the off licence at about 9.30pm on August 10, 2013.

A court was told Mr Scott collapsed on the pavement some 20 seconds after he threw the first punch - when a youth asked him for a cigarette.

Steele, who was just 17 at the time of the fatal attack, denied the charges at the Old Bailey but was told by Judge Timothy Pontius he would serve a minimum of 18 years in prison.

He said: 'This is yet another example of an utterly needless and unjustified waste of a human life  from a senseless decision by a teenage boy to put a knife in his pocket before leaving home.

'As is so often the case, that knife was not taken out with any intention in the defendant's mind to use it to cause anyone serious injury, still less to kill.

'Violence did break out, he did take out the knife and inflicted fatal wounds with such force they penetrated the aorta of Alex Scott. 

'His family lost a brother and son who was much loved for all his faults. I accept Alex Scott was not completely blameless. His attitude was aggressive and he was clearly worse for drink. 

'However the evidence does not establish the defendant was provoked, rather he was too ready to see Alex Scott's behaviour as an invitation to fight.

'The use of a knife can never be described as a reasonable defensive response to a punch.'

He continued: 'This murder was neither planned nor premeditated but arose, as so often the case in the context of street violence, in a matter of moments.

'That fact makes it all the more tragic that a human life was lost simply because a knife was needlessly carried and so what would have begun and ended with the trading of a few punches instead led to a murder.'

He added had Steele, who wore a grey tracksuit and appeared impassive in the dock, been a month older at the time of the attack, the sentence would have been much more severe. 

His co-defendant Dillon Beckford, 18, was acquitted of the same offence last week on the direction of Judge Pontius.

Yesterday, prosecutor Simon Denison QC told the court that Steele had a series of past convictions for violent crimes, including muggings, dating back to when he was 12 or 13 years old.

An impact statement from Mr Scott's mother, Rachel Van Dyke, said: 'His death was totally unnecessary and I know nothing is ever going to bring Alex back. 

'The only thing I can hope for now is the person responsible gets their just desserts.

'Nothing can ever replace Alex. He was funny, outgoing, he had a good heart and would do anything for anybody.' 

At the opening of the trial, Mr Denison told the court: 'Alex Scott was 26 when he was killed in August last year. His death was as sudden as it was violent and wholly unnecessary.

'Another life taken away in an instant by the use of a knife that was taken on to the street for no reason.

'At about 9.30pm that evening he was outside an off-licence in Eltham Road, south-east London, with a group of friends.

'They were all heavy drinkers and had spent the early evening drinking and gambling at the bookies nearby.'

He said 'words were needlessly exchanged' between Steele, his friend Dillon Beckford and the victim and his friends which led to a fight in a nearby alleyway.

Mr Denison went on: 'Alex Scott played his part by being unnecessarily confrontational and he appears to have thrown the first punch, but there was absolutely no need or justification for what happened next.

'Kai Steele took out a knife that he had in his jacket and he lunged at Alex Scott twice. He stabbed him twice in the left side of his chest.

'Either blow could have killed him. One penetrated the aorta and the other penetrated his heart. 

'Twenty or so seconds after he threw the first punch, Alex Scott collapsed on the pavement, where he died.' 

Following the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway said the murder 'had its origins in a fairly minor verbal confrontation'.

'Kai Steele stabbed him in an instant with a knife that he decided to take on to the street that day for no reason or justification,' she said.

'Alex's death was wholly avoidable and came about through Kai Steele choosing to carry a knife. 

'I hope that the sentence today will act as a deterrent if someone is considering taking a knife or weapon out with them. My thoughts are with Alex's family and friends.'
