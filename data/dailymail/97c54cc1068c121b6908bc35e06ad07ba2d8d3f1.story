Few games successfully turn the ability to remain patient into entertainment.

However, patience is by far Dishonored’s strongest virtue, a game that whisks you away to an enchanting world, before trapping you there and not letting go.

You play Corvo, a trusted guard who has been framed for killing the city of Dunwall’s beloved empress and abducting her girl.

Blown away: Corvo has loads of powers, many of which have deadly results

Thus the familiar story of redemption, revenge and retribution ensues. But what makes this so unforgettable, is the way Dishonored tells the tale.

Playing in a first-person perspective, you can approach missions with remarkable freedom.

Either go in all guns-blazing, amassing a huge body count, or use the silent approach and take your targets down non-lethally.

How you choose to go about your missions directly impacts the state of the city.

Many residents of Dunwall have been infected with the plague, and bloodbaths serve to worsen matters – turning the city into a darker, more dangerous place.

Approach tasks more mercifully, and fewer residents become infected, and Dunwall takes on a very different appearance.

The levels are brilliantly designed – each one offering true sandbox-style gameplay to allow execution of objectives to suit your gameplay style.

This is complimented by Corvo’s impressive armoury and magical abilities.

If you see a sewer, for example, Corvo can possess a rat and crawl through – perhaps finding a new way to reach his target.

There may also be roof access, which can be exploited with his ‘blink’ teleport ability, and numerous underground tunnels.

All guns blazing: If stealth is not your thing, then you can cause complete chaos

There are often so many ways to complete an assassination that you’ll spend hours trying to figure out the best way to do it.

On finding your target, the game frequently gives you the chance to kill or spare them – the latter resulting in a grisly punishment.

Although presented with a main objective, there are often many side quests to get involved in.

These serve only to give you a greater sense of purpose and never interrupt the narrative.

You’ll be awarded with Runes and other items that you can use to upgrade and unlock new powers – reinforcing the incentive to complete them.

There’s more than a slight nod to Deus Ex, Hitman and the Elder Scrolls games in the way Dishonored plays.

However, although some may have felt daunted by the sheer amount of optional missions offered in the aforementioned, Dishonored gets the balance just right.

It’s easy to lose yourself in the world, which is not surprising, given that the visual design director is Viktor Antonov – the genius behind Half-Life 2's unique look.

There’s an elegant, Tudor-like feel to the open surroundings, beautifully brought to life with the Unreal engine with very little slowdown.

Have mercy? Whether this target lives or dies is left entirely up to you

Populated by the City Watch, who bear a striking resemblance to the Combine in Valve's classic, and it’s easy to see Dunwall as a Dickinsion City 17, overrun with rats.

Sadly, the game’s strongest hand is in the early levels, and – following a rather obvious plot twist – you’ll see less of these beautiful archetypical surroundings, and more dingy grey fortresses.

It’s in these indoor areas where your powers may feel slightly constrained. You’ll often use one just because you haven’t for a while, or be prompted through the level’s design to use a certain one.

Blinking, in particular, can be quite a fiddly affair.

Enemy AI is a mixed bag, too. Although they are unforgiving and are programmed to mob you on sight, many will not see you when stood just a few metres away.

Also, characters can get jammed in doorways, which can break the otherwise immersive experience.

However, these are relatively small gripes in a game that just misses out on classic status, offering some of the best stealth-action gaming in decades.
