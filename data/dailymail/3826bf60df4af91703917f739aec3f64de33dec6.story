Not even a thousands of online supporters could save a 92-year-old World War II veteran from his vengeful daughter.

John Potter has revealed that his own daughter will evict him next week from the house in Zaleski, Ohio, that he built himself 56 years ago.

Online donors raised $138,000 for Mr Potter to buy back the home from Janice Cottrill, but she rejected his offers and demanded twice what the property is worth, he said.

As a result, Potter expects a judge will kicked him out of his own house.

In 2004 Mr 
Potter was battling a serious illness when he handed his general power 
of attorney rights to Cottrill.

Unbeknownst
 to Mr Potter, she allegedly used that power to convey the deed to the one-story, 
three-bedroom home he built 56-years ago to herself.

Ms Contrill has not said why she is so insistent about kicking her own father out of the house he built.

ABC News reports she rejected his purchase offers and demanded he pay her twice the appraised value of the home.

'To me the situation is just so heartbreaking,' Potter's granddaughter Jaclyn Fraley told ABC.

Mr Potter says appraisers told hm the home was worth just less than $50,000 - far less than he thought.

Jaclyn Fraley, 35, hasn¿t spoken to her mother and stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to place her grandfather in a nursing home

Mr Potter said his first offer to buy
 the home for appraised value was greeted with a counter offer for 
$85,000 - plus $4,000 in eviction fees and $11,500 in attorney fees.

Mr Potter raised the offer to $66,000 on June 13, but never heard back from his daughter.

‘I laid awake at night trying to figure 
out what in the world I could have done to these people to make them so 
angry at me,’ he told a local TV station earlier this year.

He didn't want to agree to his 
daughter's demands because he didn't want to give her more money than 
the house is worth, he said.

Last month, Mr Potter says was 'amazed' by the more than 5,000 people who have donated toward his original $125,000 goal.

'I never knew people could love an old man so much,' he told his granddaughter.

Potter turns 92 this week and his grand-daughter says she would love to be able to give him back the rights to his home for his birthday

After Mr Potter's daughter sent him an eviction notice earlier this year, Ms Fraley organized the desperate fundraiser for him in April while sharing with the public his dire situation.

Donations immediately poured in from 
around the world from those touched by the military veteran in Zaleski, 
Ohio whom they too called 'grandpa.'

'When
 I got out of the army and got on my feet on the ground, I rented a 
power shovel and dug a hole in the ground, built a basement and built a 
house on top of it,' he told ABC of the home.

When Mr Potter learned of the deed transfer in 2010 he switched power of attorney to his granddaughter, Jaclyn, who's now 35.

She hasn’t spoken to her mother and 
stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to sell her 
grandfather's home and place him in a nursing home.

Mr Potter has already attempted to 
sue to get his home back, arguing that his daughter had transferred the 
deed to herself illegally.

He
 initially won a county court ruling, but last year an appeals court 
ruled that because the statute of limitations of four years had passed 
on the accusation of fraud the deed could not be handed back to Mr 
Potter.

Early this 
year, Janice Cottrill and her husband Dean sent her father an eviction 
notice, saying she they had terminated his ‘existing lease.’

Ms
 Fraley said her grandfather and her mom had argued over visitation 
rights for Mr Potter's autistic son, Joe, who Mrs Cottrill took over 
custody for in 2008.

With an eviction hearing due to take place on June 12, time was steadily running out for the aging vet who fought against the Japanese in the Pacific and also worked as a train dispatcher for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.
