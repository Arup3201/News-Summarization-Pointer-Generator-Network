Unlikely trio: Turning the phrase 'fighting like cats and dogs' on its head, these heartwarming images show the bond between a Yorkie and two abandoned kittens

Chance discovery: Houston-based photographer Robyn Arouty stumbled across the animals recently in a neighbor's yard

In one shot the dog is seen lovingly licking one of the kittens and in another she sits on guard with her ears pricked.

Ms Arouty suspects the Yorkie had recently given birth and was that's where her maternal instincts came from.

However,  there were no puppies to be found. 

On finding the unconventional family, Ms Arouty called a friend at a local animal  shelter.

She said it took a bit of time to get close to the possessive Yorkie, but eventually the pup warmed up and realized she wasn't a threat.

By the end of the photography session, the furry animal dished out a 'big kiss' on Ms Arouty's cheek.

'I know that was her way of saying, "Thank you."' the photographer told the Huffington Post.

The animals have since been taken in by Buster's Friends Rescue and adoption applications  are now being accepted.

The Yorkie has been named Duchess, while her kittens have been christened William and Kate - giving them a regal edge.

Ms Arouty believes that something needs to be done to curb the number of stray animals in Houston.

'We have a severe overpopulation problem... and I lend my skills to raise awareness and find animals homes or the help they need,' she concluded.
