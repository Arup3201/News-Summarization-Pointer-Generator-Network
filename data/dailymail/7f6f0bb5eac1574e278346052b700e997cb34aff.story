Mack Holz loves singing and dancing so much, he has been dubbed the Billy Elliot of the bush.

The 11-year old lives in Lightening Ridge, in north-west New South Wales, an area with scarce opportunities for children passionate about the arts.

'Mack was passionate about this from the day he was born' said Dianne Holz, Mack's mother.

'We have always had a pretty large tree-house, and since a very early age Mack was up there or on the trampoline, singing and dancing. Even when he's doing the dishes, Mack will be singing along'.

 In year three, Mack received a life-changing opening.

'There's a class called the Moorambilla Voices. When Mack made it through the auditions, I think it was the happiest day of his life.'

The classes are run by Michele Leonard, one of Australia’s foremost choral conductors.

Ms Leonard tours various rural communities, holding workshops and scouting for a yearly musical performance which features 130 kids from surrounding rural communities.

'The workshops are open to anyone, but Michele is looking out for the kids that have a spark. Mack was lucky to have been interested in performance since he was a kid, which gave him an edge over the kids who had less experience.'

The classes allow Mack and like minded children to  work on their dreams together, under the guidance of Leonard and her lifetime of experience.

'It's had an incredible effect on his life. Mack has the confidence to believe in his ability. It has allowed him to be who he's supposed to be, and for that we're forever grateful.' 

Ms Holz said that Mack mostly keeps his performances separated from school.

'As a child, it's difficult to be different. In our communities, most of the kids just play rugby. Mack is strong enough to be proud of what he does, but he mostly keeps from dancing at school.' 

Speaking on the show Outback Choir, Mack explained ‘I chose not to be too into dance at school because then you might lose some friends or something-they might ditch you,' he said.

'Not many people go for dancing or singing.’ 

Mack explains that a Billy Elliot musical he went to in Sydney changed his life. Since then, he earned his current epithet.

When asked about how Mack feels about the Billy Elliot comparison, Ms Holz said,

'While most of the other kids look up to sports stars around here, Mack aspires to Billy. So naturally, he finds the comparison very flattering.'

Mack will feature on ABC'S Outback Choir, which screens Sunday, 30 November at 7.40pm 

 

Mack's mother Dianne says the classes have given Mack 'the confidence to believe in his ability. It has allowed him to be who he's supposed to be, and for that we're forever grateful'
