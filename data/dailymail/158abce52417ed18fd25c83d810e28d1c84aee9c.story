Test case: Unemployed people queue outside a French job centre. Six jobless people are claiming compensation from job agency Pole Emploi for failing to get them work

Six jobless French people are suing the country's employment agency for more than £1.5 million because they have not found any work.

In what is set to become a test case which will have widespread implications across Europe, all of the group are being supported by the biggest trade union in the country.

It comes as France's Socialist government struggles to cope with a spiralling unemployment rate which currently sees more than 3.2 million without work.

While most blame President Francois Hollande's economic policies for this, the six claimants want the equivalent of £257,000 each from their job centres.

They say they have not been provided them with enough leads or interviews where they can impress prospective bosses.

Florent Hennequin, a lawyer for the claimants, said that a 'breach in contract' between them and their job centre has 'already been recognised' in early proceedings.

Last September one of his clients, a 54-year-old former executive, said he had been forced to work part time delivering papers because he could not find a well-paid professional job.

Despite being registered as unemployed 
with his local job centre in the Paris suburbs for four years, he has 
received 'only three appointments' to discuss a job 'despite repeated 
requests'. None have led to any full-time work.

The Paris Administrative Court has since ordered the job centre to 'meet its obligations', which should mean showing a more proactive role in helping the man.

Mr Hennequin said his client's case could not be dealt with as a simple administrative manner, so 'we're using the routine judicial route, with an appeal for compensation' from the state employment agency, which is called Pole Emploi.

Representatives of the CGT trade union and lawyers for the jobseekers delivered their claim for compensation at the Pole Emploi headquarters in Paris at 10am today.

'If they reject it or fail to respond, we will get the administrative court involved' said Mr Hennequin.

President Hollande is, like many of his predecessors, committed to creating state-subsidised jobs, which come with generous perks

This has led to an expectation among thousands that they should immediately get a tax payer funded job if they cannot find one in the public sector.

But despite the cost of the vastly inflated public sector becoming untenable, French governments have steadfastly refused to reduce the vast amount of money it takes to employ someone in France.

With the explosion in the unemployment figures, Pole Emploi has been unable to cope with the millions seeking work.

A parliamentary report last month said it was 'too inefficient' for the task, and said its work should be 'simplified' by cutting down on red tape.

If the claimants are successful in their compensation claim, then the case will become of huge interest to other unemployed people in the European Union, including those in Britain.
