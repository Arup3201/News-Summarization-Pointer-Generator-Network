The telescope has come a long way since its humble origins in the 17th century.

The world’s largest telescope is due to be completed in March and can already capture far more than one of the first ones invented by Galileo Galilei that saw sunspots and valleys on the surface of the moon.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile’s Atacama desert reaches farther 
beyond Earth's skies than any other radio telescope and has already
captured incredible images different from anything seen before by 
visible-light and infrared telescopes.

Remote: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile's Atacama desert is one of the world's largest astronomy projects

When finished, it will be up to ten times sharper than NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.

Even now, ALMA can already show the detailed 
structures of clouds of cold gases and debris that only look like ink 
stains with other telescopes.

David Rabanus, ALMA’s instrument group manager, said: ‘What surprises me is what is being observed. Until now, we haven't had such a capable observatory.

‘We've never been able to observe with such resolution, such accuracy.’

Many parts make up a whole: When completed, 66 radio antennae will combine as a single giant telescope pointing skyward. So far, 43 have been set up

Cosmic: The telescope captured this incredible image of a pair of distorted colliding spiral galaxies about 70 million light-years away, in the constellation of Corvus (The Crow)

ALMA has even been able to detect sugar molecules in the gas surrounding a star about 400 light years away.

It is the telescope’s location in one of the harshest places on earth that makes this possible.

The 16,400-foot (5,000-metre) altitude, thin air and mercurial climate in the Atacama desert can be unbearable.

Visitors must breathe oxygen from a tank just to keep from fainting while winds reach 62 mph (100 km) and temperatures drop to 10 below zero (minus 25 degrees Celsius).

The telescope has also revealed a never before seen unexpected spiral structure in the material around an old star

Close up: The radio antennas pick up wavelengths of light longer than anything visible to the human eye

For astronomers, however, the lack of humidity, low interference from other radio signals and closeness to the upper atmosphere combine to make this the perfect spot for the telescope.

Jointly funded and managed by the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan and Taiwan, the $1.5 billion project is an engineering triumph that launches Chile, already home to some of the world's largest optical telescopes, to the forefront of ground-based space exploration.

Jose Maza, a University of Chile astronomy professor said: ‘We're talking about the United Nations of astronomy joined for a billion dollar adventure.

‘Scientists are like kids playing with very expensive toys and these ones are technological developments that could change the world.’

The telescope will consist of 66 radio antennae, 43 of which have already been set up as a single giant telescope pointing skyward.

Inhospitable: The telescope is being built in Chile's Atacama desert at an altitude of 16,400-feet. Temperatures plummet at night and winds reach 62mph

When finished, the telescope will be up to ten times sharper than NASA's Hubble Space Telescope

Test run: A transporter truck lifts a box that weighs as much as an antenna, as part of a transport test. The trucks travel 22 miles over five hours to reach the plateau

ALMA's parts are shipped from all over the world and assembled at a warehouse 9,514 feet (2,900 meters) above sea level.

The dishes are hauled up to their final destination by two custom-made 28-wheel transporters that travel 22 miles over five hours to reach the plateau.

Each antenna is perched on a rotating steel pedestal with precisely installed copper lining to protect from lightning.

The structures, 40 feet (12-meter) tall, lean closer together or farther apart as astronomers zoom in or get wider views.

The ALMA correlator is the fastest computer ever used at an astronomical site.

A board covered by scientists' notes hangs in the Operations Support Facility. As many as 500 people at a time live at 9,500 feet above sea level

As many as 500 people at a time live at 9,500 feet above sea level in shipping containers modified as trailers.

Alcohol is banned due to the sensitivity of the equipment, and those caught drinking after trips to the nearby city of San Pedro de Atacama must sleep at the security checkpoint while they sober up.

Their shifts can last 12 hours daily for eight straight days.

German astronomer Rainer Mauersberger, who works at the site, explained: ‘This project has to do with the origin of our life and our future.

'It's about how can we predict our future climates, the evolution of the earth, the sun, our species.

'We know more about our universe, our culture, than we ever dreamt of 100 years ago. Our prediction is that the real surprises here will come with things that we can't even begin to imagine.'
