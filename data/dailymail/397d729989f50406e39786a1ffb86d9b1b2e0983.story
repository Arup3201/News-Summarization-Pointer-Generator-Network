The dean of a Florida business school has died after he was run over by his own car while trying to stop it being towed away.

Elias Konwufine, 39, climbed onto the truck that was making off with his vehicle on Wednesday but lost his balance and fell off, under the wheels of his own car.

The tragic accident happened at around 6:25 p.m. outside the married father-of-three's home in Lauderhill, west of Fort Lauderdale, where he was parked illegally on the grass.

He was pronounced dead at Broward Health Medical Center three hours after the fatal fall.

No charges have been filed and cause of death has not been determined, according to Lauderhill Police Captain Rick Rocco.

'We're going back to the scene to see if there were any video recordings,' he said.

'The car was picked up from the rear end so the front wheels were slightly turned. (It was) not following true behind the truck, it's kind of like on an opposite angle, so this guy gets run over by his own car as the tow truck driver's going forward.'

Dr Konwufine's family and friends are devastated after the accident and are planning to sue the tow truck company, Capitol Towing.

'There was no reason for this. There is no justification,' a relative told WSVN TV. 'We don't know what we are going to do without him.'

Konwufine's friend, Shoghi Ndobe, told NBC Miami that he 'really wants justice, especially with the tow company.'

He said the dean, who had two doctorates by the time he was 37, was 'a wonderful person,' and added that he was 'in disbelief about what happened.'

The Capitol Towing employee who was driving the vehicle at the time told NBC he too was in shock.

'I've been doing this 15 years and it hurt,' the man, who only wanted to be identified as Ken, told NBC. 'I'm upset about it.'

He said: 'When I turned around, I saw him get back off the truck.'

Then he said he later felt 'a bump, not knowing he fell off the truck. His car ran him over.'

Konwufine's school, Keiser University, described his death as a 'tremendous loss.'

'Keiser University is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Elias Konwufine,' it said in a statement.

'Dr Konwufine touched and positively shaped the lives of his students, alumni and colleagues in special ways, every day, and collectively our hearts remain heavy as we cope with this tremendous loss.'
