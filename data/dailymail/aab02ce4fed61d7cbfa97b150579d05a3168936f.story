As Aaron Hernandez's old New England Patriot teammates prepare for Sunday's Super Bowl, the former tight end is getting ready for his Massachusetts murder trial to finally start.

A jury of 13 women and five men was seated by Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Monday after more than two weeks of jury selection.

Six of the 18 jurors will be randomly selected as alternates just before deliberations start.

Hernandez is charged with killing Odin Lloyd of Boston in June 2013. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. He has pleaded not guilty.

The judge said because of the blizzard approaching the region, opening statements have been rescheduled for Thursday, though they could be postponed further because of the weather.

On Monday afternoon, Garsh continued to screen additional potential jurors in case one of the 18 seated is unable to serve.

Sunday's Super Bowl will be the Patriots' first appearance since 2012, when Hernandez caught a touchdown pass in Super Bowl XLVI.

At the time he seemed to be a man with a bright future. At age 23 he had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the team.

He and his fiancee had started a family and were living in a mansion in the Boston suburbs with their 8-month-old daughter.

But prosecutors at his trial will paint a different picture of him as a killer who orchestrated the shooting of semiprofessional football player Lloyd.

He was arrested on 26 June 2013, just days after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park near his North Attleborough mansion. The Patriots cut him less than two hours after he was arrested.

Hernandez, now 25, is also charged with killing two men in Boston in 2012 because he felt disrespected after one of them spilled a drink on him at a nightclub.

He pleaded not guilty after being charged in those shootings in May, and the case has not yet gone to trial.

Lloyd, 27, played for the Boston Bandits football team and was dating the sister of Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee. Prosecutors say he and Hernandez were friendly and had been at a nightclub together a couple of days before he was killed.

Prosecutors have said Hernandez and two friends from his hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, picked up Lloyd at his home in Boston's Dorchester section around 2:30 a.m. on June 17, 2013.

Those men, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately.

From Dorchester, prosecutors say the four men drove to North Attleborough in a rented Nissan Altima, stopping along the way to buy bubble gum at a gas station. An hour after he left his house, prosecutors say Lloyd was dead, shot multiple times by a .45-caliber Glock.

They have not said who pulled the trigger, but say Hernandez orchestrated the killing. The murder weapon has never been found.

Prosecutors have said toll booth, video surveillance, GPS and cellphone records clearly place Hernandez in the car with Lloyd at the time of his murder, and have said video from the security system inside Hernandez's own home shows him walking through his house with a gun minutes after the killing.

Christopher Dearborn, a professor at Suffolk University Law School, says that while the Bristol County District Attorney's office has a lot of circumstantial evidence, its challenge is to offer a motive to jurors.

Prosecutors have said a possible motive was that Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where the 2012 shooting took place. But Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh last month ruled they may not introduce anything having to do with the 2012 killing in the Lloyd murder trial.

The lack of a clear motive is the biggest weakness in the prosecution's case, Dearborn said.

'You need to give a jury a reason why, or they're going to have pause,' Dearborn said. 'I don't think they have a motive that they can present in concrete fashion with witnesses that can support a motive.'

Hernandez's legal team is likely to focus on the holes, Dearborn said.

'We don't have a weapon. We don't have a confession. We don't have eyewitnesses,' he said.

Hernandez's team does not have to offer a defense or explanation, or even deliver an opening statement. But Dearborn said he expects to hear one.

'They will absolutely have to have their own narrative,' he said. 'That narrative will probably suggest alternatives.'

Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee has been charged with perjury for allegedly lying to a grand jury — including when she said she could not remember what she did with a box prosecutors believe she disposed of after getting what they called a coded message from Hernandez. She has pleaded not guilty.

In the run-up to the trial, Jenkins was often seen in court, and the judge this month granted a request from Hernandez's legal team that she be allowed to attend the trial to support him even though she is listed as a potential prosecution witness.

But two days before the trial began, the district attorney petitioned the judge to grant Jenkins immunity, which would compel her to testify. The court has not said yet whether it was granted.

Jenkins has not been seen in the courtroom since.
