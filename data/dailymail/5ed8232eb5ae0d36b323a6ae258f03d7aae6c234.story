ISIS has released a slickly produced new video warning the United States of the carnage it wants to inflict in Iraq if President Obama deploys troops to the war-torn nation as he attempts to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the terror group.

Resembling a blockbuster movie trailer, the disturbing 52-second video entitled 'Flames of War' shows militants blowing up tanks in dramatic slow motion, wounded US soldiers apparently being executed and the White House in the sights of a shaky camera.

It then shows a clip of the president from before the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq saying that combat troops will never return to the Middle Eastern nation, before the video ends with a text overlay that reads, 'Flames of War -- fighting has just begun ... Coming soon.'

Threatening: The video is widely seen as a response to the Obama administration's decision to consider deploying troops to Iraq

The video's timing, released yesterday, suggests it was a direct response to General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who told the Senate Armed Services Committee that fighting in Iraq may require the use of ground troops.

The video was released by the al-Hayat Media Center, which has become known for its propaganda videos for ISIS which include high-production values, CGI explosions and slow motion footage.

The video also appears to mock the United States by including an image of the infamous 'Mission Accomplished' banner that made an appearance on board USS Abraham Lincoln during George W. Bush's victory speech in 2003 following the US-led invasion of Iraq.

President Bush's former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld also makes an appearance in the video, walking through Iraq during the occupation.

Destruction: During the video ISIS soldiers are seen to unleash multiple and successful strikes on US troops and tanks in the Middle East

Blast: The video - which bears all the hallmarks of a highly produced Hollywood trailer shows the destruction of US military targets at the hands of ISIS

That image is then followed by a picture of the White House at night, filmed by a moving camera from what is presumably a car driving past. 

The movie is just the latest heavily edited video from ISIS, that has included gruesome footage of the beheadings of two American journalists and a British aid worker.

General Dempsey told a U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday that American troops might soon provide Iraqi forces with 'close combat advising' in the fight against the ISIS terror army.

That clarification of the Pentagon's mission in the Middle East could mean that U.S. soldiers and Marines are embedded with Iraqi army units, helping them conduct warfare.

Slow motion: ISIS militants are seen to heroically survive American attacks and retaliate with superior force in the video

Gen. Martin Dempsey, who chairs the military's joint chiefs of staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the American military is currently serving a purely advisory role. But in certain circumstances, he said, they might provide 'close combat advising.'

Citing a hypothetically urgent mission focused on 'retaking Mosul' as anti-war protesters provided frequent interruptions, he said he could envision U.S. troops 'accompanying that mission.' 

Asked by New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte whether the president has ruled out the use of American ground forces in a combat role, Dempsey responded, 'Yes. But he has told me as well to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.'

He said that if needed, he 'would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces.'

Mocking: The video attacks President George W. Bush's assertion in 2003 that the invasion of Iraq was completed

Ominous: The video shows a brief and shaky clip of a car driving past the White House filming it - clearly threatening the home of the US president 

In his opening statement, he said that 'if we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets, I will recommend that to the president.'

ISIL is an alternate name for ISIS. 

President Obama has maintained that American forces won't have a combat mission in Iraq.

But Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe said Tuesday that he's not convinced the White House is true to its word.

'It will take an army to beat an army, but instead the President presented a limited counter-terrorism strategy,' Inhofe said during the hearing.

'His claim of "no boots on the ground" is an insult to the men and women in Iraq today who are serving in harm’s way. We already have boots on the ground in Irbil and in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.'

Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel faced multiple questions from lawmakers in the first high-stakes hearing examining Obama's expanded military campaign to counter the relentless terrorist threat from Middle East extremists.

The U.S. military conducted strikes near Baghdad against ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. ISIS has seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria. 

Obama is seeking congressional support to train and equip vetted Syrian moderates fighting both the Islamic militants and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.

Dempsey said the United States is prepared to strike Islamic targets in Syria.

'This will not look like "shock and awe" because that is not how ISIL is organized. But it will be persistent and sustainable,' Dempsey said, referring to the air bombardment at the start of the Iraq war in March 2003.

Hagel seconded him.

'Because ISIL operates freely across the Iraqi-Syrian border, and maintains a safe haven in Syria, our actions will not be restrained by a border in name only,' he said. 

Doing Obama's bidding: Hagel, shown with the president after a Medal of Honor ceremony on Monday, is responsible for implementing his policies -- and taking blame if they fail or if 'mission creep' kicks in

Several lawmakers have their doubts about the United States being pulled into a larger war, with increasing numbers of American troops. The president has already dispatched more than 1,000 Americans three years after combat forces left Iraq.

Many Republicans and Democrats have expressed reservations about the ability to identify moderates in a country awash with rebel formations and shifting alliances. The Islamic State grew out of the al-Qaeda movement, but the two are now fighting. In some instances, the moderate Free Syrian Army has teamed with al-Qaeda's local franchise, the Nusra Front.

Hagel said the U.S. will monitor them closely to ensure that weapons don't fall into the wrong hands.

'There will always be risk in a program like this, but we believe that risk is justified by the imperative of destroying ISIL – and the necessity of having capable partners on the ground in Syria,' the defense secretary said.

Anti-war protesters filled the front rows at the hearing, chanting 'No more war! No more war! No military solution!' at the start of the session and repeatedly interrupting testimony.

'War is not the answer!' one activist yelled as Hagel was introduced. Committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, snapped.

'Would you please now leave? I'm asking you to please leave. You're acting very warlike yourself,' Levin told them.

Hagel said the involvement will not be 'an easy or brief effort. We are at war with ISIL, as we are with al-Qaeda.'
