A chance encounter has led to a lifetime's work for two American brothers, who are dedicated to helping a South African orphanage.

The brothers first got involved with the center when Northwestern University graduate Nick Grava decided to miss his flight home so he could work at the children's home.

Before long, Nick had become managing director, and his brother Chris had joined him in trying to increase funding for the 30 youngsters, many of whom lost parents to HIV and Aids.

The brothers recently released a heartwarming video, filmed on a GoPro camera, that showed the children greeting Chris after a six-month break.

The delightful video shows the children crowding around the brothers, laughing and smiling as they are thrown into the air or spun around, and dancing in the yard.

The video was released as part of a campaign to try to raise $12,000 for charity Intsikelelo to keep the orphanage running for another year.

When political science graduate Nick, who studied in Illinois, first visited it in 2012, it could barely cover its basic expenses, such as diapers for the babies, or pay for the caregivers.

Nick, who had been visiting his brother who was studying in South Africa for a semester, saw the challenging circumstances as a chance to do some good. 

He now works full time at the center and his brother Chris travels there regularly to help out.

Partnerships and strong links were made with the local community and towns back in the U.S, and they helped set up the charity Intsikelelo, which means blessing and is the name many residents refer to Nick by.

As well as raising funds to keep the children clothed, fed and healthy, the charity helps provide them with an education.

'We bring in six to ten volunteers on a daily basis to tutor them in school. We also work to bring counselors from Cape Town to work with the kids,' Chris told Ellen TV.

He added that the brothers were also trying to challenge the stereotype of orphans sitting around miserably.

'Every time they talk about orphans, it’s sad and miserable. Meanwhile, you get there, and it’s so much different,' he said.

'It’s like that every day. The kids are so pumped to see you and happy. It takes nothing to blow their mind … it’s a party.'

Intsikelelo is currently raising funds to cover the running costs for the next 12 months. Thanks to the video and a Crowd Rise site, the brothers have been able to raise awareness - and much-needed funds.

By Tuesday, nearly $9,000 had been donated to help pay for the basic necessities. The brothers hope that over time other donations can be found to pay for new beds and furniture, and a computer laboratory.
