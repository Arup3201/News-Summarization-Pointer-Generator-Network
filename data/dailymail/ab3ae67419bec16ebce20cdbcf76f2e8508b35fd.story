With their ears pricked up and tails wagging, these excited hounds are raring to go as they bound through the autumn countryside as part of their exercise regime ahead of the new hunting season.

With the season traditionally starting on November 1, huntsman Andrew German, of the Cheshire Forest Hunt, made sure the dogs were prepped and ready as they raced through fields and over beds of orange autumn leaves .

Although a ban on fox hunting has been in force since February 2005 many supporters of fox hunting are continuing to call for a repeal of the ban, saying the current law is hard to interpret and enforce.

The Hunting Act of 2004 bans the hunting of wild mammals, notably foxes, deer and hares, with dogs in England and Wales, although dogs are allowed to follow an artificial scent.

A trail of scent is set out in such as way to mirror the movements of hunting live quarry, although with no live prey the progress of the hunt is less predictable and of a slower pace than that of a drag hunt.

A combination of oil and either animal meat or urine is used, with the scent being dragged across the land for 10 or so miles.

Hunting in its current form can be traced back to the 16th century.

Proponents of fox hunting view it as an important part of rural culture and useful for reasons of conservation and pest control, while opponents argue that it is cruel and unnecessary.

Under the Hunting Act a person also commits an offence if he knowingly permits land which belongs to him to be entered or used in the course of hunting wild mammals, or allows a dog belonging to him to be used for hunting.

Anyone found guilty under the Hunting Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine.

The pursuit of foxes with hounds was banned in Scotland in 2002, although it remains legal in Northern Ireland.

Throughout the 1800s and early 1900s hunts in Cheshire hunt were divided and reunited. In 1947 Mr Philip Hunter founded the Cheshire Forest Hunt, taking over vacant land and buying sporting rights from the North Cheshire hunt.
