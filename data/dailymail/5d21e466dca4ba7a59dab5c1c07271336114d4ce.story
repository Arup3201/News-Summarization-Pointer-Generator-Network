A controversial judge who jailed a rapist for just 45 days has stepped down
 from the case after saying the 14-year-old 
victim 'wasn't the victim she claimed to be'.

Defendant Sir Young, 20, was given the 'lenient' sentence for raping a fellow pupil at Booker T. Washington High 
School in Dallas, America - despite a possible 20-year jail term for the crime.

But State District Judge Jeanine Howard caused further outrage when she appeared to make comments about the girl's promiscuity - even though Young had pleaded guilty to the rape.

Now the judge - who also came under fire for giving Young community service in a rape crisis centre - has removed herself from the case.

The judge had told The Dallas Morning 
News: 'She wasn't the victim she claimed to be. He is not your typical sex offender.

'There are rape cases that deserve life. There are rape cases that deserve 20 years.

'Every now and then you have one of those that deserve probation. This is one of those and I stand by it.'

Prosecutor Josh Healy said Young's 
victim, who is now 17, had been left in tears by the ruling.

He said she
 and her family told him they were 'shocked'  and 'extremely 
disappointed'.

But Judge Howard told the newspaper she gave the sentence because medical records indicated the 
girl had three sexual partners and had given birth to a baby - something the victim's family denies.

Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said his prosecutors had pushed for five years' prison time.

He
 also said the judge did not order Young to follow standard sex 
offender requirements, such as attending treatment, undergoing an 
evaluation or staying away from children.

Prosecutors will now ask the new judge on the case to re-evaluate Young's probation, potentially giving him stricter conditions, according to the paper.

Judge Howard's outspoken comments were not the first time she had been criticised over the case.

The judge was also forced 
into an embarrassing U-turn after the chief of the local rape crisis 
centre refused to allow Young to carry out the community service portion
 of his sentence there.

Bobbie Villareal, executive director of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center, told WFAA.com: 'I’m sure she probably thought that it was his way of giving back perhaps.

'But it’s just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision.'

Ms
 Villareal slammed the 'lenient' conditions passed down by Judge Howard,
 who is known in legal circles for her creative approach to sentencing.

She said: 'It is a deterrent to all survivors when you see a very lenient sentence like this passed down.

'It
 sends a devastating message to survivors of sexual assault. That 
victim’s family definitely didn’t feel like there was justice for her 
and for other survivors of sexual assault.'

Young's sentence of deferred adjudication probation means that if he meets various terms laid down by Judge Howard, he will not have a permanent criminal record.

As well as the community service order, he must also spend 45 days in jail and a further 24 hours in jail every October 4 - the date of the rape - for the duration of his probation.

Changes: Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room where the rape happened

The court heard that the pair were kissing in a practice room at the performing arts school, but that she had told him to stop when he began rubbing her body, the paper reported.

Ignoring her pleas, he instead pulled off her leggings and raped her.

'I didn’t want to do anything other than kiss,' the victim told the court.

She said she had told Young 'no' and 'stop' before and during the attack.

Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room and installed CCTV cameras.
