Frolicking in the sand this baby elephant is clearly giving the sun-seeking tourists a run for their money as she plays on the beach of a Thai island paradise.

Amused holidaymakers caught the Asian elephant calf pulling poses worthy of a swimwear model - only without her trunks - as she dried off in the sunshine after taking a dip in the Indian Ocean.

The young elephant, named Lucky, had been enjoying a bath in the warm waters when she was captured on camera by British tourist John Lindie, from Glasgow.

A lucky shot: The Asian elephant calf, named Lucky, was playing on the beach on the island of Phuket after enjoying a bath in the warm waters of the India Ocean

Mr Lindie, a marketing manager, had been staying on the island of Phuket with his wife Clare as the couple celebrated her 30th birthday.

He said: 'Just beyond the hotel grounds was the beach leading into the Indian Ocean and Lucky - the name of the elephant in the picture - was being taken down by her guardian to have an early morning swim.

'She lived in a nearby nature sanctuary with her parents and the guardian told us that Lucky's parents had been rescued from a known poachers area on mainland Thailand and taken to their new safe location.

'The pictures were actually very fortuitous, Lucky and her parents lived in a nearby nature sanctuary and I happened to be up early one morning while Lucky was being given her bath and I was "lucky" enough to capture her as she dried off by frolicking in the sand, and she seemed so happy.

'I had taken my camera to try and get some pictures of the storm as it came in and was very lucky to end up with some fantastic images of Lucky who seemed oblivious to the storm that was brewing in the background.'
