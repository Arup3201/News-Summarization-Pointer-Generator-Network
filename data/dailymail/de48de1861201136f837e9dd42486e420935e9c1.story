Joanne Berry, 30, posed on websites such as Cougar Shag declaring she liked role play

A woman today told of her terror when a stranger burst into her home, saying he was there to carry out 'a fantasy rape' on her.

Joanne Berry, 30, from Grove Park, south-east London, is accused of arranging for the woman, her work colleague, to be ‘raped’ by men she tricked on online sex chat rooms.

No rape took place but the men she duped into going to the alleged victim’s home were led to believe she would willingly participate in such a fantasy, the court heard.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, described how she was at home on April 29, 2012, when she heard a bang on the front door.

She told a jury at Maidstone Crown Court: 'I opened the door and there was a male there that I didn’t recognise.

'He asked if I was (the victim’s name) and I said yes.

'And the next thing I knew he had pushed the door open and was trying to force his way into my property.

'I had my hand on the door and I was pushed back. I was absolutely petrified.

'My sister was in the house and I just screamed for help.'

She said when the man, Dean Hicks, heard her scream he looked 'startled' and asked her, ‘Is this a wind up?’

She told the court: 'He said he had been chatting to someone on the internet who he believed was me.

'He said the person wanted him to come to the property and carry out a fantasy rape by knocking on my front door and then trying to push his way in.

'He said once he had carried out the "rape" he was to get information about Joanne Berry from me.

'That’s when I thought she must be behind it. He said he was told a password to make sure that I was the right person.

'The password was "feathers".

'I told Joanne once that whenever I see a white feather I always think of my grandparents, like they are my guardian angels.'

The woman said Mr Hicks told her she should phone the police, who came to see her later that day.

He told court how he went to meet the alleged victim for 'kinky sex' but was horrified when he realised they had both been set up and that she
 was not expecting him.

Maidstone Crown Court heard he had chatted with a woman on a 
website called Cougar Shag and that she had told him she liked 
'dominant' sex and 'rape'.

When Berry was arrested her computer was found to contain conversations with several men describing violent rape fantasies

Mr Hicks said when he first knocked on the door of the address he was given there was no answer.'

I went back to the car, I messaged her saying "this isn't right,
 what's going on?" She said "well knock again, shout, knock louder, make
 a scene, make it like you're really angry".'

Mr
 Hicks told the jury that after returning to his car and messaging the 
woman - said to be Berry - she told him 'the curtains are moving, you 
can see me'.

He added: 'I went
 back to the door and this time somebody answered. She opened the door 
six inches and I put my foot on the step.

'A woman said "what do you want?". I saw her face and I knew the poor girl was scared witless.

'She looked pure panic stricken, that is not what I was expecting. I was expecting a wink or a nod to carry on.'

Mr Hicks said he returned to his car again and messaged the woman (allegedly Berry) for a second time, asking what was going on.

He said this time he got a confused reply.

'It was the first time I'd gone to meet up with someone I've been
 talking to online,' he said.

'I guess I was hoping to get sex at the end of it. I 
suppose I was groomed, that's the way it felt.'

Mr Hicks said he returned to the alleged victim's house later that day - April 29, 2012 - with a letter of apology.

She
 told him she would call the police and he said 'yes, please do' and 
waited in his car for three hours until officers turned up.

He
 said he gave the police the log-in details for the Cougar Shag website 
but they didn't follow it up straight away and by the time they did, 
three months later, the relevant messages had been deleted.

Earlier the woman told the court how Berry had confided in her in March 2012 that she had been raped by two men.

She said Berry would send her up to 12 texts a day and she had tried to support her and encouraged her to go to the police.

She said: 'She kept mentioning her dead sister saying that I reminded her of her. As time went on it made me feel uncomfortable.

'I was beginning to think that she was substituting me for her sister.'

On April 13, 2012, the victim received a text message from Berry implying she was going to kill herself.

Concerned, the woman alerted police but then became angry when Berry gave police a false address.

She told the court: 'I was angry and disappointed in what she had done. I said to her that she needed professional help and I needed to step back from the situation.

'I realised she had no intention of killing hersef. That was all about attention.'

The woman told her manager at work what had happened and Berry was sent home.

The alleged victim said: 'She blamed me for it. She texted me and said she had thought she could trust me.'

She told the court about a further incident on May 23, 2012, when a man approached her on her driveway as she arrived home from work at 5.45pm.

She said: 'He asked if I was (victim’s name). I just knew what it was about. I panicked and told him to get the hell away from me.

'He said "I’m not here to hurt you".

'He said he had been on a chat line talking to someone he believed was me and I had invited him round.

'He said it was called UK Chat. I absolutely panicked. I got indoors as soon as I could and I locked the door and phoned the police. I thought he had it in mind to rape me.'

Berry is charged with putting the victim in fear of violence, committing an offence of assault with the intent of committing a relevant sexual offence, the common assault of the victim and attempting to cause the victim to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.

The prosecution claims Berry committed the offences by procurement. Berry, a temporary office administrator, denies all four charges.

The trial continues.
