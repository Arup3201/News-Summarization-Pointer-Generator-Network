Six thousands troops in Afghanistan have celebrated the last Christmas that British forces will spend in Helmand province.

Servicemen and women wore festive hats, jumpers, onesies, tinsel and fake beards while tucking into more than four tonnes of turkey, gammon and trimmings flown in for the occasion - a meal which takes more than six months of planning.

They also had a visit from Father Christmas in a Chinook helicopter and sang carols, ran a half marathon in festive gear and recorded heartfelt video messages for their families.

Merry Christmas! About 6,000 troops in Afghanistan wore festive hats as they tucked into a festive feast with all the trimmings, many of them at Camp Bastion

Festive: Troops celebrated the holiday away from their families in this photo taken by their colleague, Sergeant Dan Bardsley. Many have young children back home

Cheer: The Christmas dinner haul for the soldiers included two tonnes of turkey, one and a quarter tonnes of gammon, half a tonne of sprouts and 8,400 mince pies

Touching: Many of the servicemen and women sent heart-warming video messages to friends and family in Britain. One joked Camp Bastion was at least hot and sunny

Senior Logistics Officer Major Luke 
Dance from Oxford, who is serving in Joint Force Support, Camp Bastion, said: 'Being away from home at Christmas is always 
difficult for any soldier.

'We
 have an important job to do here, but we try to make sure that as many 
people as possible get to sit down and have a traditional Christmas 
lunch.

'It's a good morale boost and the small details help to bring a little bit of home to Afghanistan.'

Many of the troops were at Camp Bastion, Britain's main base in the troubled nation. Hundreds 
of personnel attended Christmas eve carol services followed by Midnight Mass in several tented chapels across the camp.

As Britain slept this morning, 
hundreds of runners ran a half 
marathon round the British and American sectors, sporting everything 
from Christmas cracker body suits to Father Christmas onesies.

Father Christmas - aka Regimental Sergeant Major Scott Hawke - waved from a Chinook helicopter swooping 
overhead, then fired a 105mm 
artillery gun to set the runners on their way. Later he appeared on a lorry dressed still in costume and delivered presents.

And they're off! 'Santa' fired a heavy-duty artillery gun to signal the start of a half marathon round the British and American sections of Camp Bastion this morning

Feast: Troops enjoyed two tonnes of turkey, one and a quarter tonnes of gammon, half a tonne of Brussels sprouts and to cap it all, the Queen's speech

The Tactical Air Transport Detachment at Kandahar Airfield also had an unusual radar blip from the man in red.

Commanding officer at the airfield John Turner thanked the public for their support, adding: 'We've got some events to bring Christmas to the troops
 here such as carol singing round a tree... the Queen's speech, 
Christmas type films, all of those sort of activities that troops would 
normally do back home to make things a bit more homely.

'In
 terms of our operations over Christmas there's no change to our normal 
tempo. Every day is a normal day on operations so troops will be working
 as per normal but outside of their normal activity we're squeezing in 
those Christmas events for them.'

Troops gave heartfelt messages on 
camera while dressed in Reindeer ears, tinsel, Santa hats and beards. 
One even jogged while delivering a message in a Father Christmas onesie.

The Domestic Fire Section at Camp Bastion donned festive jumpers to sing We Wish You a Merry Christmas.

Lance Corporal Laina Beardsall jumped out
 from behind a Christmas tree and said: I just want to wish my family and 
friends back in England a very very merry Christmas. Not to rub it in 
your face but it's lovely and sunny here in Afghanistan - I hope the 
weather's not too bad back in England! Love you lots.'

Dave Small said: 'Merry Christmas, 
especially to my wife Karen and my littl'un, Kayla. Happy first 
Christmas darling. I love you lots. I'll see you soon.'

Getting in the spirit: Festive costume among the British troops ranged from token Santa hats to a full-on elf onesie at the Christmas Eve carol concert

Simon
 Cameron from 39 Royal Engineers said: 'A merry Christmas to my wife, my
 son Keyan and a merry Christmas to all. Ho ho ho ho!'

A
 colleague added: 'I'd like to wish a merry Christmas to my family. 
Really sorry I can't be there, but I'll phone you as soon as I can. Love
 you all.'

Another, Jack 
Walsh, said: 'I'd just like to wish a merry Christmas to all my friends 
and family back home. I hope you have a lovely day and I'll see you in 
March.'

Major Andrew Gifford
 said: 'I'd like to say a special merry Christmas to my wife Sharon and a
 special shout out to my colleagues in Hampshire Police.'

And
 John Orchard said: 'I'd like to say a very merry Christmas to all my 
friends and family back home on the Isle of Wight and my lovely 
girlfriend Abigail in Lincoln. I'll see you very soon.'

Thousands of personnel also enjoyed Christmas meals elsewhere in world, including on ships and land in Cyprus, the Falklands Islands and Gibraltar.

HMS Illustrious, whose recent deployment was extended to deliver critical humanitarian aid to the Philippines, made special arrangements for Christmas.

The Ship's Commander Logistics, Phil Hally, said: 'When our deployment was extended we arranged for Christmas boxes to be sent out for every member of the Ship's Company.

'Everyone plays their part in the preparations, with officers helping to peel potatoes and serve, but leaving it to the professionals to cook the turkeys.

'Although it isn't the same as having Christmas at home with our loved ones, Christmas lunch at sea in this iconic ship really isn't a bad second best!'

A drawdown is already under way in Afghanistan and all combat troops are due to have left by the end of 2014.
