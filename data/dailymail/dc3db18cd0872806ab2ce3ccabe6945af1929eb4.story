The key with breastfeeding seems to be to stick with it six months or so to see any benefit in terms of weight loss

Looking at pictures of Kate Middleton playing volleyball at Olympic Park, just 89 days after Prince George’s birth was truly mind blowing.  Her flat stomach was proudly on display in her J Brand skinny jeans and 4-inch heeled wedges – this was a woman who knew she looked incredible. So just how did she do it?

Well, according to US weekly, sources insist her weight loss has not been intentional. 'Kate's hardly done anything to lose the weight….(she’s) still breastfeeding and the small weight she gained while pregnant has just melted off. A few weeks after George was born, you could hardly tell she had just given birth.'

Breastfeeding – the magic bullet of weight loss. Just breast feed and the weight will melt away. But is it really true? Or merely part of a world-wide, government supported conspiracy to get women to adhere to the adage that breast is best?

As I limped out of Chelsea Westminister Hospital after giving birth, I can vividly recall the encouraging words of my midwife, ‘yes, you’ve got a bit of a tum, but with breast feeding you will lose that right away.’ 

Waddling home, two sizes bigger than I had ever been before, that statement was a great comfort in the weeks ahead. Indeed, it became my mantra – repeated on a loop in my mind every time I caught unintentional glimpses of my new form in the mirror.

Indeed, I had high hopes for the power of breast feeding, having heard legendary tales of weight dropping off due to the power of the calorie-burning bosom.  I kept hearing again and again; ‘Breastfeeding is a super work out. It burns between 500-700 calories per day.’ I thought for once in my life, there would be a simple and easy solution to dropping pounds: God’s reward for feeding my baby the natural way.

Supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio openly attributed her postpartum slim-down to Pilates, spinning, surfing, and breastfeeding.  And celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson, whose clients include Gwyneth Paltrow and Kim Kardashian says, that when it comes to dropping baby weight, 'My number one thing is that I’m a big breastfeeding advocate.'

Heidi Klum, who lost 30lbs in six months after her pregnancy, credited breastfeeding for her rapid post-natal weight loss (that and taking nude pictures of herself every week to track her body changing). Um, not happening, like ever.

The Duchess of Cambridge showed off an incredibly flat stomach just weeks after giving birth to her first  child, leading many to question how she had managed to shed the weight

In any case, I certainly had a lot of reasons to be optimistic. However, despite going on a healthy diet, the weight was really sticking.

I felt like a walrus laying down fat for winter.

I started to ask other mums and baby experts about whether or not breastfeeding is indeed the golden ticket to weight loss that they’d hoped for – and the results were somewhat surprising.

Dr Marilyn Glenville PhD (www.marilynglenville.com) is one of the UK’s leading nutritionists specialising in women’s health.  She tells me, ‘In theory, breastfeeding does burn calories (about 750 extra calories a day) but not everyone reacts the same way.  The extra weight you put on in pregnancy can be used to produce breast milk and the weight loss can be more noticeable if you breastfeed for longer than three months.'

And as for my personal experience she says, 'Your story is not unusual in that some women do not experience weight loss and their appetite can increase during breastfeeding making them gain more weight. The evidence seems to show that the longer you breastfeed the better the weight loss.

'The weight loss seems to take effect between three to six months after the birth as your body uses more of your fat stores and your appetite can decrease at this point as the baby is having less feeds.’

I reached out to the lactation experts Medela – the makers of the world’s most popular breast pump, figuring they had a vested interest in this.

They said, ‘Plenty of research shows that breastfeeding certainly does support weight loss, however the key is that it is not always within the first few weeks as people hope for. In the first few months very little will happen as the body is trying to figure out how to cope with supply and demand, and how much energy expenditure they will invest in their milk supply.

They backed these claims up with several academic studies, including one that measured the weight loss of breastfeeders vs. formula feeders.

They found greater weight loss in breastfeeding women (a loss of 4.4 kg vs 2.4 kg), but this was mainly lost between three and six months.’ Their conclusion was that 'lactation enhances weight loss postpartum if breastfeeding continues for at least 6 months.’

So the key seems to be, you have to stick with it six months or so to see any benefit in terms of weight loss. However, that statistic must also be balanced with the fact that for some women, you can’t lose all your baby weight until you actually stop. In fact, several experts agreed that breast feeding can slow you weight loss down at the end.

Tanya Zuckerbrot, author of The F-Factor Diet says, 'A lot of women say it helps with a lot of the weight up front, but the last 10 pounds, if you’re breast-feeding, are very hard to lose.'

Jane Munro a midwife and professional advisor to the Royal College of Midwives says she’s not sure where all these breast feeding/weight loss promises originated. ‘There are definitive reasons as to why breast feeding is the best option for babies. However, as for breast feeding leading to weight loss, there isn’t real evidence behind it. No one has proven a strong association between breast feeding and weight loss. I think some women have found that to be their experience and have told other women about it – but there isn’t really the academic evidence to prove it one way or the other.’

As for the assurance I’d had from my own mid-wife Jane added, ‘Some midwives might suggest that it helps you lose weight, but we certainly don’t put any recommendations out about that. It’s entirely possible that midwives hear this from some of the women they look after and therefore this can end up being part of the midwife’s conversation from that point on.’

Nutritionist Zoe Harcombe, author of the bestselling Harcombe Diet (which is suitable for breast feeding women), scoffs at the claims that breast feeding is the key to weight loss. She says, ‘There was an academic study of 315 women in Brazil over two years. The average weight loss at six months was 2.5kg, 3kg at 12 months (i.e. only a further 1/2 kg in six months) and only 1.9kg at 18 months (i.e. a slight regain). That’s a 0.077kg difference at 24 months. That's 77 grams! That's like taking your rings off and cutting your toe nails before weighing!’

She adds, ‘The majority of studies reported little or no association between breastfeeding and weight change, Breastfeeding is without a doubt the single best nutritional start you can give your baby – and that's the best reason to do it!'

Ultimately it would be ridiculous to base your decision of whether or not to breastfeed based on whether or not it helps with weight loss. After all, there are far more important factors to consider and at this stage in the game, it’s not really all about you. Having said that, I wish I had known this beforehand; I might have said no to a pizza or two.

Indeed, whilst breastfeeding may not be the golden ticket I was hoping for, I’m not giving up. Chubster or no, I know it’s good for my baby girl, who clearly loves it. In fact, I’ve just ordered a brand new, hands free, double action breast pump, known as the ‘the Rolls-Royce’ of breast pumps.
