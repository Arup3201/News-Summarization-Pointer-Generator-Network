As Christmas cheer starts to wear off, it seems that Brits nationwide are preparing to put their New Year's resolutions into action and make some serious life changes.

Dubbed 'Massive Monday', today will see more extra-marital affairs begin to bubble and job applications written than any other day of the year.

New research reveals that spending time with loved ones over Christmas, coupled with trepidation about the year ahead causes the spike in life changes.

'Christmas and New Year is a week of lockdown when there is no excuse for avoiding family time.

'Marriages are often stretched to breaking point over the festive period and thousands of unhappily married people look for a new partner during this time,' claims a new study.

Today is typically one of the first days back to work and back to freedom and spouses take this opportunity to explore all the things they couldn't under the watchful eye of their partner, claims the research.

IllicitEncounters.com, who carried out the study, see 25 per cent higher levels of activity during this time compared with the rest of the year.

Another survey by divorcedpot.co.uk found that 1.8million couples argued over the Christmas break and one in ten blamed this on the extra time spent with their partner, while one in four blamed it on the excessive alcohol consumption.

As well as relationship doubts, one in three Brits want to change jobs for better job satisfaction or more money - recruiters even dub today 'Massive Monday' as CVs fly in.

In the past, it was more common to have a 'job for life' and 'to work your way up the ladder' within one company or sector until it was time to retire.

However, young workers aged 18-29 are twice as likely to drastically change career directions, with nearly two in three saying they have already changed careers at least once or are planning to in the near future.

This seems to be a growing trend across generations; as opportunities for reinvention become more feasible, older workers are making changes in their careers too.

More than four out of five people over the age of 50 who relaunched their career did so over the age of 40, while more than one in ten havenâ€™t changed careers yet, but still plan to before they retire, found a study by Scottish Widows.

Professor Wendy Loretto, of University of Edinburgh Business School, said: 'As people adapt to all of the factors changing our career environments - from the unstable financial climate, technological innovations, and an ageing working population - they are realising the need to be more self-reliant in achieving their ultimate aspirations, and this often means reinventing themselves to start on a new path.'

Another key factor affecting people 
seeking to embark on extra-marital relationships and hunt for new jobs is Seasonal Affective 
Disorder (SAD).

During
 the winter months, symptoms including lack of energy, withdrawal from 
friends, family and social activities, decreased sexual interest in 
their partner can all lead to depression and lack of pleasure.

People 
suffering from this might seek an extra-marital affair or exciting new job as a way to 
counter-act the effects of S.A.D, claims IllicitEncounters.com
