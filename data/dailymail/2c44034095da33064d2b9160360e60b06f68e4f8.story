A second wild wallaby has been found and captured after being spotted hopping around Highgate Cemetery.

The first was caught two weeks ago by the RSPCA. It had suffered a broken foot, and died during surgery last Thursday.

A second wallaby was found in the cemetery - the final resting place of Karl Marx - on Friday and was treated for a sore foot and has now been rehomed.

Discovery: A second wild wallaby has been captured after being spotted hopping around Highgate Cemetery

Happy ending: The animal was found in the cemetery - the final resting place of Karl Marx - on Friday and was treated for a sore foot. It has now been rehomed

It is believed that someone dumped both marsupials in Highgate Woods and that they made their way to the famous cemetery.

The chairman of the Highgate Cemetery Ian Dungavell said: 'We felt she should be taken away and re-homed. 

'She had a sore paw - not as badly damaged as her friend - but we wanted a vet to look at her.

Capture: The first wallaby was caught two weeks ago by the RSPCA after venturing into a children's playground in Hampstead, London

Tragic: It had suffered a broken foot during its escapades, and died during surgery last Thursday

'She had some treatment, has made a 
good recovery and has since been rehoused some where privately with 
people who can look after her.'

He
said staff and visitors would miss the wallaby, but that the cemetery 
was not a good long-term place for the Aussie mammals to live.

He added: 'It was interesting to have her here but this is a burial ground, not a nature park. 

Unusual surroundings: It is believed that someone dumped both marsupials in Highgate Woods and that they made their way to the famous cemetery

'People are coming here to pay their respects to deceased relatives and friends and we felt a wallaby could perhaps be a distraction, It was a matter of balance.

'We have plenty of bird life, hedgehogs, spiders - they may not be as attention grabbing as a wallaby but we felt the cemetery wasn’t a really good long-term home. 

'It was unusual having her around, and I can understand why people were so enthused. I’m sure the staff and volunteers here will miss her.'
