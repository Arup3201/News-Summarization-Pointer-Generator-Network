The eccentric Australian billionaire behind plans to recreate the Titanic has revealed his latest project - a Jurassic Park style theme park filled with robotic dinosaurs.

Clive Palmer has ordered more than 100 mechanical dinosaurs from China, to install in his Palmer Coolum Resort.

He already has a life sized T-Rex, with a 20-metre long and 3.5-metre high Deinosuchus, a crocodile-like creature, due to arrive by the end of next month.

The 20-metre long, 3.5-metre high Deinosuchus undergoing final construction in China. It will be one of 165 robotic dinosaurs shipped to the Australian Palmer Coolum resort.

A life sized T-Rex has already been installed at the resort, where the Australian PGA is set to held later this year.

The Deinosuchus, whose name 
translates as ‘terrible crocodile’, was one of the biggest prehistoric 
crocodiles that ever lived.

Apart from its sheer size, the Deinosuchus 
is very similar to today’s crocodiles, illustrating how little evolution
has taken place in the species over millions of years.

Today’s saltwater crocodiles possess the strongest bite of any living animal with a maximum force of over 16,000 newtons.

The bite force of the fearsome Deinosuchus is believed to have exceeded 18,000 newtons.

The animals, which will be displayed in the woodlands around the resort, will sway their tails, heave their chests and blink.

'At
@PalmerCoolum resort we'll have the world's biggest dinosaur exhibit, 
with 165 animatronic dinosaurs,' the mining magnate tweeted.

Mr Palmer made an application to the 
Sunshine Coast Council last year to turn part of the Coolum resort's 
golf course into a dinosaur park.

The first dinosaur to be installed, called Jeff, widely seen as a dig at Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney, oversaw  the 2012 PGA Championship at Coolum.

Mr
Palmer said the next shipment would include a 1200 kilogram 
brachiosaurus and a 7 metre tall mamenchisaurus - both tall plant-eating
reptiles.

'The Deinosuchus, whose name translates as 'terrible crocodile', was one of the biggest prehistoric crocodiles that ever lived,' the statement announcing the latest addition said.

'Apart from its sheer size, the Deinosuchus is very similar to today's crocodiles, illustrating how little evolution has taken place in the species over millions of years.'

The
first remains of a Deinosuchus were discovered in North Carolina in the
1850s, but fossils of the massive predator have been found in Mexico 
and ten US states, including Texas, Montana, and many along the east 
coas

The massive reptile will begin the journey to his new home in Coolum this weekend and is expected to arrive by the end of April.

Earlier this year the mining magnate from Australia has 
announced plans to build an exact replica of the original Titanic ship 
with a view to offering holiday cruises on the ill-fated liner's 
original route from Southampton to New York.

The original: The Titanic, pictured here leaving Belfast in 1912 for sea trials, was dubbed the 'unsinkable ship' before it sank off the coast of America killing more than 1300 passengers

The
nine-deck, 840-room ship will be constructed to the same dimensions as 
the Belfast-built White Star Liner - 270 metres long, 53 metres high and
weighing 40,000 tonnes. 

Built
in China, Titanic II will also remain faithful to the classifications 
of the original ship with passengers able to buy first, second and third
class tickets.

A maiden voyage is planned for 2016 from Southampton to New York.

Palmer said: 'Since we announced our plan in April we've had a huge amount of 
interest, particularly from people wanting to know how they can secure a
booking for the maiden voyage, along with commercial sponsors.'

Titanic II will seek to closely match the design of original vessel, which sank on the fifth day of its maiden voyage in April 1912, killing more than 1,500 passengers and crew.

It will boast the same interiors, and even the same onboard gymnasium, complete with Edwardian exercise machines.

The
grand staircase, smoking room, Cafe Parisien and various dining rooms 
will also be recreated, as will the reading and writing room, the 
swimming pool and Moorish-influenced Turkish baths.

More
than 1,300 passengers perished when the Titanic hit an iceberg on its 
maiden voyage on April 12, 1912.

Earlier this year, a memorial cruise 
carrying relatives of Titanic victims among its 1,309 passengers, the 
same number as on the doomed ship – set sail from Southampton for the 
Titanic’s wreck site.
