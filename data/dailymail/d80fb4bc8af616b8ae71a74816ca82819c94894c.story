Following reports the average person looks at their phone 110 times a day, a doctor has warned that too much smartphone use could actually be damaging our spines.

Slumping over phones and tablets reading messages or playing games - dubbed 'iSlouching' - can cause the head to sit further forward and add pressure to a person's spine.

Florida-based Dr. Matt Herba claims that many people, especially children, are already reporting neck problems and, long-term, this damage could become permanent.Â 

Slumping over phones and tablets - dubbed 'iSlouching' - can cause the head to sit further forward and add pressure to a person's spine. Florida-based Dr. Matt Herba claims many people, especially children, are already reporting neck problems and this damage could become permanent

A study published in the International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics found 53 per cent of mobile phone users suffer numbness or neck aches - dubbed 'text neck'.

Another study by San Francisco State University discovered 83 per cent of people have experienced 'some hand and neck pain during texting'.

These people also displayed other signs of tension, like holding their breath and increased heart rates.

'Studies now show that as the head starts to go forward, it can add up to 10 pounds of pressure to the spine,' said Dr. Herba, a chiropractor from Winter Springs, Florida.

He told News 13 young people are experiencing neck pain from leaning forward over their mobiles, and this could lead to irreversible damage to the cartilage and tissue between the vertebrae.

The report also found orthodontists are 
seeing a rise in children grinding their teeth, and damaging their jaw, while 
playing games - dubbed 'iGrinding'.

Long-term, Herba believes this will lead to increasing back and neck pain among older people, and as it can take years for the symptoms to be fully revealed, advises people to limit the amount of time they spend using their devices now.

Mobile operator O2 added: 'O2 is aware 
continuous or excessive texting or game playing with a mobile phone can 
have the potential to cause harm.

'Users must be aware of the risks of repetitive strain injury (RSI), for example. RSI is an umbrella term referring to various kinds of injuries to muscles, tendons or nerves caused by repetitive movement of a part of the body.

'It has not been scientifically proven that texting and playing games on a mobile phone can cause RSI, however, we recommend that you do not grip the phone tightly and hold the phone up in front of you to reduce flexing of the neck.'
