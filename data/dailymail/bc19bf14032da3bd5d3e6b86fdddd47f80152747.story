David Cameron last night condemned the ‘appalling’ and ‘chilling’ slaughter of innocent civilians in Sri Lanka as he and Prince Charles arrived there for the Commonwealth summit.

The Prime Minister flew into a diplomatic firestorm after demanding that President Mahinda Rajapaksa hold a new inquiry into his regime’s human rights abuses.

But Mr Cameron’s hosts hit back, accusing him of behaving like a colonial bully.

The Prime Minister is due to defy Mr Rajapaksa today by becoming the first world leader to visit Jaffna in the Tamil north of the country since Sri Lanka became independent in 1948.

He will then meet Mr Rajapaksa and warn that he has ‘serious questions to answer’ about the murder of 40,000 civilians at the end of the civil war in 2009.

Mr Cameron has faced pressure to boycott the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital. But he seized on footage smuggled out of Sri Lanka, which showed the regime shelling civilians in a supposed no-fire zone and the execution  of prisoners.

'These are chilling images of appalling acts and they need to be properly investigated,’ he said. ‘There are legitimate accusations of war crimes that need to be properly investigated.’

He said the footage screened by Channel 4 has been ‘verified’ as true by the United Nations.Mr Cameron added that the Tamil Tiger terrorist group, which specialised in suicide bombings, ‘did appalling things as well’.

But he said the onus was on Mr Rajapaksa to come clean ‘about how the long war ended and the appalling scenes we’ve seen on television of thousands of innocent civilians being killed at the end of that war’.

Mr Cameron added: ‘Part of my message to President Rajapaksa is he should be seizing the opportunity to win the peace.’

Mr Rajapaksa hit back, insisting he has ‘nothing to hide’ and seeking to justify the killings on the grounds that violence has now ended. ‘I will be meeting him and I will also have to ask some questions,’ he said. ‘If anyone wants to complain about a human rights violation in Sri Lanka – whether it be torture, whether it be rape – we have a system.

‘People were getting killed for 30 years. At least after 2009 we have stopped it. There is no killing in Sri Lanka today.’

Sri Lanka’s information minister said the Prime Minister only condemned human rights abuses there in order to pander to Tamil voters in the UK.

Keheliya Rambukwella added: ‘We are a sovereign nation. You think someone can just make a demand from Sri Lanka! We are not a colony. We are an independent state.’

Mr Cameron denied that he was lecturing a former colony. ‘We are two sovereign governments, this is 2013, and we should have these sorts of frank conversations,’ he said.

Mr Cameron is due to visit a refugee camp and a Tamil newspaper that has suffered censorship and oppression by the regime, but Downing Street aides believe Sri Lankan officials may try to prevent him going to the north of the country.
