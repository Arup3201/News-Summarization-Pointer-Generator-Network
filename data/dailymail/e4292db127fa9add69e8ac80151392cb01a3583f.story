Two tigers have been clocking up some serious air 
miles after being flown 14,000 miles to London to take part in an 
international breeding program.

It is hoped the two Sumatran tigers, one from the
 USA and one from Australia, will breed now they've touched down at Heathrow airport to start 
their new lives at London Zoo.

The tigers flew to their new home in
 under 24 hours to avoid the pilots having to ground 
the planes for the animals to be fed.

There are fewer than 300 Sumatran tigers in the wild and the breed is critically endangered.

Melati, a female from Perth Zoo in 
Australia arrived last month and Jae-Jae, a male tiger from Akron Zoo in
 Ohio, arrived last weekend.

The female was brought to the zoo first, giving her time to mark her territory before the male was introduced two weeks later.

The tigers were accompanied by a dedicated zookeeper from London Zoo 
though space was made on board for items from the tigers’ luggage, 
including around 10 pounds of meat and 2 gallons of water

To ensure the safety of the tigers on 
board, bespoke travelling crates were created for the wild cats, 
equipped with infrared cameras to allow each tiger’s on-board keeper to 
monitor their well being throughout the journey.

ZSL London Zoo’s curator of mammals, 
Malcolm Fitzpatrick said: 'We’re all really excited by the arrival of 
Jae Jae and Melati at ZSL London Zoo and they’re both settling in really
 well.

Jae-Jae in his new home. The tigers will be the first residents of the zoo's new Tiger Territory when it opens in spring next year. The zoo coordinates the global
 breeding programme for Sumatran tigers

'It’s no simple feat moving tigers 
around the world, and we enlisted the help of DHL to deliver our 
precious cargo for us – not only were Jae Jae and Melati treated like 
royalty, DHL completely rescheduled their flight plan to get them here 
on time.'

The tigers will be the first residents of the zoo's new Tiger Territory when it opens in spring next year.

The zoo coordinates the global
 breeding programme for Sumatran tigers, which uses a system called the 
studbook to match animals.

The studbook holder is responsible for 
pairing well-matched animals and recording details such as birth place 
and parentage to ensure a healthy and genetically-diverse population of 
animals in the breeding programme.

Phil Couchman, CEO of DHL Express UK 
& Ireland which transported the tigers said: 'This is an extremely 
worthwhile cause and a massive logistical operation for DHL – our 
priority throughout the operation has been the safety and well being of 
the tigers.
