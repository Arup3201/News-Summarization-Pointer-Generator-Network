Richard Hill, 34, said he left the boy alone for an hour and a half to walk to an IHOP half a mile away

A father has been charged with child neglect after leaving his seven-year-old son home alone with burning candles which caused a house fire.

Richard Hill, 34, said he left the boy alone for about an hour and a half on Sunday night while he walked to a nearby IHOP, and returned to find his home burned down.

The boy was able to escape the blaze, which happened at about 12.35am, and ran half a mile to a local convenience store to warn Sheriff's deputies.

The house had been lit with candles since
 Friday after the power was switched off, according to a Brevard County 
Fire Rescue spokesman.

The State Fire Marshal's Office said the fire happened after a candle in one of the bedrooms ignited the blaze.

The boy's 13-year-old sister Tamiah Martin, who was staying with their grandmother, told Bay News 9: '(We) used to walk to the store a couple of times together, and I'm pretty happy that we did because if not, he wouldn't have made it to the store by himself.'

The home's roof partially collapsed during the fire, and the structure was declared a total loss.

Neighbor Devon Peoples said: 'I looked out of my window, and I saw the boy running down the street. So, I walked out because when I looked out the window, I saw him and then I looked and I saw the fire.'

The boy was able to escape the blaze, which started in one of the bedrooms at around 12.35am, and ran half a mile to the local convenience  store to get help

Hill is expected to make a first appearance at the Brevard County Jail on Monday afternoon.
