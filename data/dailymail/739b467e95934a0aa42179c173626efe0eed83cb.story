Tamara Ecclestone loves bags. Particularly Hermes Birkin bags.

But even her billionaire father - Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, Britain's fourth richest man  sometimes feels her bag-buying habit is getting out of hand.

Speaking to InStyle magazine, the socialite - whose estimated worth is £300m - said: 'Sometimes he's like, "Another handbag, Tamara? That's a bit nuts"...I think he's glad that I'm not hurting other people. I've never been to rehab. It could be worse.'

Ecclestone, 28, is standing inside her legendary walk-in wardrobe, a multi-room experience in her Chelsea home that is stuffed to bursting with designer garments, accessories, shoes and bags.

In the shoe section there are over 120 pairs of Louboutin heels - an average cost of £500 each.

And she has a glass cabinet reserved exclusively for some 30 Hermes Birkins in every colour of the rainbow - bags which routinely sell for between £5,000 and £100,000.

But soon Ecclestone will be packing all her glittering possessions into boxes (or, rather, she'll be paying someone else to do it), and leaving the house that has a swimming pool in the sitting room...for one that has a nightclub in her basement, a bowling alley and a million pound bathtub.

She and her dogs - Alvin, Puggle Socky, Buster, Hob Nob and Duke - will be relocating to the £45m Kensington mansion (complete with £18m of refurbishments) she bought for herself and her now ex-boyfriend, stockbroker Omar Khyami, 38.

Tamara plans to give her collection of some 30 Hermes Birkin bags - which sell for between £6,000 and £100,000 - to a daughter if she has one

The couple broke up in August after she discovered he had been involved in a sex tape, but Ecclestone is just relieved the couple didn't get married or have any children, and is excited about the future.

Explaining that will 'never ever ever' speak to Khyami again, she said: 'It's a new beginning. Perfect timing. And when I'm ready, I'll meet a new man.'

The glamorous party girl is, in the meantime, preparing to launch her own range of beauty products, SHOW Beauty, next year.

But for now, her clothes and bags are
 keeping her warm at night, even though her mother, former Croat model 
Slavica, says her daughter's wardrobe appalls her.

She
 said: 'My mum walks into my wardrobe and goes, "You're sick, Tamara! 
This isn’t normal!' Which it probably isn't, but...it makes me so 
happy.'

As for the new wardrobe in the new house, Ecclestone's dressing room and private bathroom will be spread over an entire wing at the back of the first floor

The centrepiece is the £1 million stone bathtub, carved out of white crystal. The bath, which will require reinforced floors to support its two-ton weight, will be illuminated from underneath and semi-transparent.

The other half of the wing will  be dedicated to the model's exhaustive designer wardrobe.

Miss Ecclestone, who once said that she had 'lost count' of the number of £5,000 Hermes Birkin handbags she owned, will have her clothes stored in six rows of wardrobe racks, dedicated to either 'eveningwear', 'casual/gym wear' or 'everyday'.

The room will feature a lingerie cabinet, handbags on a conveyor rack and two TVs.
