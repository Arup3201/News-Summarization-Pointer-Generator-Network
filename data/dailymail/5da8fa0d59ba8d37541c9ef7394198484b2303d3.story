These spectacular sprawling landscapes are beautiful all day - but appear even more magical when bathed in light at sunrise and sunset.

Photographer Chip Phillips, 42, said he will never see anything as 'amazing' as one foggy sunrise over the Palouse region, Washington, America.

On his travels across thousands of miles, the married father-of-one documented frosty mornings, glowing sundowns and even a double rainbow. Mr Phillips said although the area is within 15 minutes of his home in Redmond, he never tires of seeing it.

'The Palouse always takes my breath away, especially when the light is very good.The region can be very peaceful. I find that most of the time I am the only one photographing, especially in the lesser known areas, which is magical,' he said.

'All of these shots took me many attempts to capture the images when the conditions were just right. I drove thousands of miles across the area in search of new locations, and visited and re-visited the more known spots to get the most spectacular light.

'I love that each of the photos presents the landscape in unique light, but my favourite is probably the foggy sunrise. The conditions were so amazing that morning and I don't believe that I will ever see anything like that up there again in my lifetime.

'It was definitely one of the highlights of my career.'
