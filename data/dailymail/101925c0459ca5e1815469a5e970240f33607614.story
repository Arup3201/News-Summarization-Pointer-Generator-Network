No wonder Manchester United can't wait for Wayne Rooney to return in the Manchester derby on Sunday. The Etihad is a particularly happy hunting ground for the England striker with seven of his record 11 derby goals coming there – including his last five against City.

So while Manuel Pellegrini's men will boast home advantage, the Premier League title and a better team than their neighbours, United's players inside the away dressing-room will see Rooney and still believe they can win.

Nobody has scored more Manchester derby goals than Rooney – 11 in 22 appearances. There will be international talent worth hundreds of millions on show but none is proven in this special fixture than Rooney.

The 29-year-old will return from a three-match suspension to wear the captain's armband for the first time ever in a Manchester derby and his return can't come soon enough for United who have failed to win their last two games without him and are off the pace for a top-four finish.

Some of his best moments in a United shirt have come against the emerging enemy from across the city – the special atmosphere clearly fires him up.

Most famous of course was his spectacular overhead kick against City in February 2011, which was voted the best goal of the first 20 years of the Premier League. It was important too – the winning goal in a 2-1 United victory at Old Trafford, but it's by no means his only derby highlight.

After drawing a blank in his first derby, Rooney sent out a warning to City fans for future years by converting a Gary Neville cross to score in a 2-0 United win at the Etihad in 2005.

The change in City's ownership in 2008 was always likely to tilt the balance of power away from United, who had been completely dominant in Manchester before then.

But Rooney more than any other Red seemed to thrive on the challenge.

In the first derby of the “Abu Dhabi era”, Rooney scored the only goal at The Etihad in 2008 and United went on to retain the Premier League.

City have become serial trophy-winners themselves since then but Rooney has always been the one player they have failed to control.

He followed up his wonder-goal in 2011 by scoring four times against City the following year.

He struck twice in an FA Cup tie in January and twice more in a Premier League game in December. Ironically, both games at The Etihad ended with United winning 3-2.

His last derby goal was less celebrated though, a weak consolation in a 4-1 defeat during the dark days of David Moyes.

There were those who thought Louis van Gaal's arrival in the summer might be a threat to Rooney. After all Robin van Persie was Van Gaal's World Cup captain for Holland.

It hasn't worked out like that though. After much deliberation, the new United manager turned to Rooney to be his captain as successor to Nemanja Vidic.

Van Gaal felt United's captain should be British and ingrained in the values of the club. Though Rooney is from Liverpool rather than Manchester, he has been at Old Trafford for a decade and set to pass Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time goalscoring record one day.

A red card against West Ham for kicking Stewart Downing to prevent a counter-attack was unwise. But nothing in United's results since then has suggested that Rooney won't walk straight back into the team as captain and leader.

Falcao has taken time to adjust following his loan move from Monaco and been hit by minor injuries that often accompany a return from a long-term injury, his knee.

Rooney's last goal in a Manchester derby came in United's 4-1 thrashing at the Etihad last season

Juan Mata has failed to convince in a No10 role and was taken off by Van Gaal against Chelsea before United scored the equaliser.

So Rooney is set to face City – a foot problem early in the week seems to have been overcome - and remains one of the first names on van Gaal's team sheet, either up top alongside van Persie or as a No10 behind the Dutchman and Falcao.

Rooney's will-to-win was epitomised by his reaction to losing at City last season. He had just broken the record for derby goals but it was no consolation following a 4-1 loss.

'Not good enough,' he said afterwards. 'We have to improve, stop giving these sloppy goals away and capitalise on some of our good play.'

That is exactly what he will be trying to do on Sunday and given his Etihad record, City will be wary.
