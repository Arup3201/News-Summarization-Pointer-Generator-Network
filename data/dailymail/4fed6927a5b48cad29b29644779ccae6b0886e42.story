With only six weeks left until the birth of her first child, Savannah Guthrie is letting the weight-gain rules fly out the window.

The 42-year-old NBC host reveals in her Today.com blog that after gaining 30lbs since falling pregnant last November, she sought advice from her OB/GYN, worried she was in 'weight-gain overtime.'

'I asked my doctor: Should I worry that I've already whizzed past the recommended 25-30lb weight gain? "You're pregnant," he shrugged. "Don't worry about it."'

No weight worries: Ms Guthrie, pictured earlier this month, recently revealed that she has so far gained 30lbs during her pregnancy, which her OB/GYN advised her not to 'worry' about

Ms Guthrie, who stands at a statuesque 5'10, writes that, for her, one of the 'joys' of being pregnant is the relief of putting her weight-worries to bed for a while.

'Unbutton those jeans and glory in the elastic waistband. There is no point in sucking in your stomach, or squeezing into a dress, or trying to look good in a bathing suit,' she muses.

Ms Guthrie admits, however, that she is still well-aware it 'isn't healthy' to pile on too much blubber during pregnancy, and furthermore, that she doesn't want to 'dig a weight gain hole so deep' that she can't exercise her way out of it once the baby is born.

The expectant mother notes that the average unborn baby weighs between 2-3lbs at 30 weeks old, the stage of her own pregnancy.

'The other 28 pounds is boobs, clearly, and who knows what else: blood and fluid and placenta and what have you,' Ms Guthrie speculates, adding that the pregnancy weight-gain rule is only a 'recommendation,' and that if a woman looks and feels healthy, perhaps she should relax.

 Gaining too much weight during pregnancy
 increases the risk of various complications, including gestational 
diabetes and high blood pressure.It can also increase the baby's risk of health problems at birth and childhood obesity.Women
 of a normal weight before pregnancy are advised to gain about 25 to 
30lbs, according to The Institute of Medicine, but for overweight or 
obese woman, that recommendation falls to between 11 and 25lbs.

'You know what we don't need?' she writes. 'Another big heaping serving of guilt weighing us down.'

Ms Guthrie didn't go public with her pregnancy announcement until March, when she was already five months along.

One of her first tasks when she returned from her 'Babymoon' to her job at the Today show, was to talk about her changing body.

As she looked at herself in a mirror, Ms Guthrie said: 'I love my baby bump. I love the fact that I'm 42 years old and lucky enough to get this chance, and the human body is remarkable.

'I'm divinely inspired, I think, to be able to create life. So right now, I'm just loving that my body is able to do this and produce life.'

Wedded bliss: Ms Guthrie married her husband Michael Feldman at their 'surprise' wedding in March (pictured) and publicly announced her pregnancy a few days later 

Ms Guthrie is married to Michael Feldman, a 45-year-old Washington D.C. communications strategist, who she met in 2008, and got engaged to last May.

They tied the knot in March outside Ms Guthrie's home town of Tucson, Arizona, without publicizing the event to media.

The couple have chosen not find out the sex of their baby until it is born in August, and it has not yet been revealed who will fill in for Savannah on the Today show during her maternity leave.
