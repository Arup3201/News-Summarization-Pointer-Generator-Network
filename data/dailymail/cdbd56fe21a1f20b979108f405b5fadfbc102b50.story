A Channel 4 documentary which explored the hidden world of dog fighting has received more than 4,000 complaints from viewers who were outraged by bloody scenes of alleged animal cruelty.

Going to the Dogs, which aired last night, sought to expose the culture associated with the controversial sport, which animal charities and police warn is on the rise.

But the programme came under heavy criticism today for glamourising the issue - with the RSPCA now calling for the broadcaster to hand over footage so it can investigate those taking part.

Going to the Dogs: Dylan Duffus is shown talks to professional 
dogfighters in the documentary film, which has received thousands of complaints
 since it was aired on Channel 4

After it was aired, Channel 4, which said 470,000 watched the programme, was inundated with complaints from viewers who were horrified by a real-life dog fight between two ferocious pit bull terriers.

The channel received 2,000 complaints in less than 24 hours, as well as 600 complaints before the show was aired. In addition to this, another 1,000 complaints were sent to the broadcaster via an automatic template on protestors' websites.

Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom also said it had received more than 1,000 complaints over animal cruelty allegations.

Now the RSPCA is calling for the broadcaster to hand over footage of the show so it can investigate those involved in the murky underworld of the sport.

In a statement it said: 'Overall we believe that ‘Going to the Dogs’ was ill-conceived, irresponsible and has done to nothing to help animals, fought or farmed.

'The RSPCA will continue its work to investigate and uncover illegal dog fighting and we are calling on Channel 4 to hand over the footage and reveal the identities of the dog fighters so that we can fully investigate this cruelty.'

The programme, which was produced by Latimer Films, saw filmmaker Dylan Duffus, a former gang member, interview those involved in dog fighting - something which in recent years has been described as a growing 
problem in the UK's inner-city areas.

But those who were interviewed had their identities concealed
 for the cameras, as they spoke openly about their dogs, how they train 
them for fights and how they deal with injured and dying animals.

The programme looked into the hidden criminal world associated with dog 
fighting but was accused of glamourising the controversial sport

Footage
 was shown of a savage dog fight, battery farming, 
the shooting of racehorses and of a game
 shoot - all of which were slammed by animal rights activists.

There were also interviews with those involved in pheasant shooting and sports such as horse racing, which avoid the kind of 
hostility that dog fighting attracts.

RSPCA criticised the show for comparing these different sports with dog fighting, saying it was a 'disingenuous red herring designed only to court controversy'. 

There was also outrage on Twitter during and after the show was aired.

‏@JeanHaines said: 'I couldn't watch "Going to the Dogs" and I'm angry that @Channel4 gave air time to an illegal practise, what next?'

While ‏@emmafc74 wrote: 'PLEASE EMAIL CHANNEL 4. Abs.disgusting programme, turned off after 10 mins.Sickening.'

'We believe that ‘Going to the Dogs’ was ill-conceived, irresponsible and has done to nothing to help animals, fought or farmed'

But Channel 4 defended its decision to broadcast the show, saying it was 'proud' to have shed light on an important issue.

Yesterday, the channel refused to budge after an animal rights activist garnered nearly 22,000 supporters in a campaign to have the programme removed from the schedule.

Adrian Newsome from Macclesfield took his campaign not to air the 
show to Change.org and soon had thousands supporting him.

The petition blurb read: 'We as dog lovers do not want to watch such programmes like this they are not showing it to stop dog fighting they are showing it to get ratings!' (sic)

A spokesman for Channel 4 said: 'Channel 4 are proud of this authored film which sheds light on an underground activity believed to be on the increase.

'The film raises important issues about animal welfare and blood sports in general and highlights man’s conflicted relationship with dogs and other animals. The audience was made aware of the content in advance of TX.'

The outcome of a dog fight is a source of pride between rival gangs and firearms and drugs are never far away.

 young men are apparently being attracted and while there are hot spots,
 including South Wales, it's a growing national problem.

The simple idea is for the two to maul each other until one is dead or incapacitated. 

A spokesman for the production company has not yet responded to a request for a comment.
