A lesbian college student has launched a fundraising campaign to pay for her tuition after her parents learned she was gay and cut her off.

Kate Koenig, 19, said her 'homophobic' parents refused to pay for her classes at the University of Pittsburgh after her father opened her mail last year and learned about her sexuality.

Determined not to let their decision affect her education, Koenig is now hoping to raise $15,000 to cover her tuition, living expenses and her medication for asthma and allergies on GoFundMe.

Koenig, who said her parents also took issue with her female-to-male transgender boyfriend, explained that her extended family are also homophobic, meaning she has no one she can turn to.

Plea: Kate Koenig, 19, has launched a fundraising campaign online to help her fund her degree at the University of Pittsburgh after her 'homophobic' parents found out she was gay when they opened her mail

'Going to 
Pitt is a dream of mine and I couldn't bear the thought of not being 
able to stay there,' she wrote on the page. 'I will be immensely grateful if your 
contributions allow me to stay at Pitt. I'm praying every day for a 
miracle to help make this possible.'

Koenig, who
 wants to be a writer, said she is a good student who has repeatedly 
made the Dean's List for academic excellence and that she does not want 
to give up her students in English, History and German.

She
 explained that her parents found out she was gay just before she 
started her first year at Pittsburgh in September last year and that, by
 that point, they had already paid for her first semester.

They later agreed to co-sign a loan with her for the second term but have refused to do the same for the upcoming academic year.

She explained 
on her fundraising page that she has money saved from a summer job and 
$6,500 in loans but was unable to get any other financial help or 
scholarships to cover the costs.

Together: She dismissed claims that dating Will meant she was straight, saying: ' I am still gay. Being in a "straight" relationship does not take away my sexuality'. The couple have been together over a year

As she is 
unable to afford the whole year at the university, she said she will be 
studying classes at a community college in the fall before heading back 
to Pitt for the spring semester.

But
 on Thursday, she revealed that she had also been let go from her job at
 Costco because they had 'overhired' and were firing all their newest 
employees.

To help her reach her goal, she set up the fundraising page and is using a hashtag '#KeepKateInCollege' to spread the word.

By Friday afternoon, the website had raised more than $5,000.

Koenig is currently staying with friends and spends a lot of time thinking where she will stay next.

Her Facebook page and social media profiles show that she has received a lot of support from her boyfriend's parents.Â 

Struggle: This week, she shared a document showing she had been fired from Costco because the company had overhired. She lamented that it was her main source of income to supplement her loans

Support: Koenig is pictured with Will and his family who have given their support to Kate and her campaign

On her 
GoFundMe page, Koenig, who identifies as gay and pansexual, explained 
that her parents have also taken issue with her boyfriend, Will, who is 
transgender.

In response to comments about this, she added: 'So many are claiming that I am straight and this is just my attempt to make a fake gay story for money.

'Regardless of if I am dating him or anyone else in the LGBT community I am still gay. Being in a "straight" relationship does not take away my sexuality.'

She added: 'I did not openly come out. My father went through my mail.'
