Men are are obsessed by their appearance and modern life - including the wider and more accepted use of porn - is to blame.

Comedian Alex Brooker has investigated the rise of the vain, metrosexual man for a new documentary and discovered that peer pressure, pornography and an omnipresent media are having far-reaching effects.

In the programme, which airs tonight, the 27-year-old admits that he is ashamed of his physique so embarks on a series of extreme weight-loss solutions. But along the way, he discovers he is far from alone, with most men having some hang-ups about their imperfect body.

Indeed, more and more young men are embarking on extreme diets, punishing exercise regimes and undergoing cosmetic surgery.

A major factor that is thought to be contributing to men's poor body image is the wide use of pornography.

The rise of the 'metrosexual man' has seen a whole new industry of men's magazine and products develop

Alex's
 friend agrees, saying that pornography 'distorts people's reality' and that
 'even though it isn't real, it does give you insecurities'.

Alex
 then meets well-known, muscly porn actor Demetri XXX, who explains that the porn 
industry's audience and demands have changed over the past decade.

'Before I started working, there were no really handsome or fit guys doing what I do,' he said.

'But since I started working there's been more pressure to look good. It' not just about women.

'[Also] it's not just men that watch us now - women and couples watch it together 
too -  so men feel more insecure.'

Pornography 
producer Justin Ribeiro Dos Santos agrees: 'As an industry, we have a 
massive influence over how men feel about their bodies.

'Porn is now watched by so many people that, along with other media, we are changing how people feel about themselves.'

This
 could be said to be reflected in the increasing number of men going 
under the knife.

'When
 I first started doing surgery around 10 to 15 per cent of my clientele 
were men,' London-based cosmetic surgeon Dr Grant Hamlet told Alex.

'But over the past six or seven years, it has grown to 60 per cent.'

Indeed Dr Grant has himself undergone surgery to give himself a ripped torso.

Physically 'perfect' celebrities such as David Beckham were also blamed for rise in insecure males

In the documentary, called 'Alex Brooker: My Perfect Body', the comedian also interviews his younger brother Elliot, 16, who, along with friends has started to pump iron at his local gym.

When
 asked why they have decided to get a gym membership, they say that they 
want to 'look good, be healthy and get girls'. They have even altered their diet to increase their protein intake and maximise their muscles.

They
 discuss the fact that their generation was born into a 
world where an obsession with posting 'selfies' on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter are the norm.

The
 teenage friends say that most of their friends doctor their photographs using software such as Photoshop before
 they post them online because it is 'so important' to make sure a person 
look good in today's society.

According to recent research, a growing minority of men dislike their body, with one in three admitting they would give a year of their life up to improve their appearance.

Teenagers in the documentary said their friends 'doctored' photos  to look perfect before they posted them on Facebook

Another study found that 80 per cent of men are unhappy with the way they look and 70 per cent are even ashamed of their body.

Two in five men are also thought to be on a diet at any one time.

Even more alarming statistics suggest that up to 70 per cent of teenage boys are unhappy with their body.

And since 2000, the number of male anorexics have shot up by 27 per cent - twice as fast as the growth rate in females.

The documentary also finds that the popularity of advertising that employs perfectly honed male celebrities such as David Beckham, is also contributing to the male obsession with appearance.

Indeed for the first time ever, men's health magazine's have overtaken men's lifestyle publications.

There is also a burgeoning industry in men's fitness DVDs.

One man in the programme said 'If you're fat, you're seen as lazy or a loser. Being fat is a sign of being unsuccessful.'

Finally, the fact that men, unlike women, can be very vocal about their friend's insecurities compounds the problem.

One woman in the documentary said: 'A 
woman wouldn't dream of pointing out a girlfriend's imperfections but 
men see a mate's belly as excuse to tease.'
