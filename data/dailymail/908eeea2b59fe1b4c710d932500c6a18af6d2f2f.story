For Bob and Sally Dowler, the week ahead will not pass easily.

Thursday is the 11th anniversary of the day their 13-year-old daughter, Milly, was abducted and murdered as she returned from school.

It would be six months before her body was found in a wood 25 miles away from their home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey.

And it would be longer still, a full nine years, until Levi Bellfield, the former club doorman who killed her, would finally be convicted of her murder. But for the Dowler family even that would bring no closure.

In July 2011, less than a fortnight after the trial ended, the Guardian reported that News of the World journalists had intercepted and deleted voicemails on Milly’s mobile phone.

The claim was especially toxic because her parents had thought at the time that it might have been her deleting the messages, giving them false hope that she was still alive.

For the Guardian this ‘false hope moment’ would prove to be the spark it had been looking for to detonate the phone-hacking scandal.

Such was the scale of public outrage that within days Rupert Murdoch had closed down the 168-year-old Sunday tabloid.

Soon afterwards Rebekah Brooks, News International’s chief executive and a former editor of the paper, was forced to resign.

News International paid the Dowlers £2million compensation with Murdoch personally donating an additional £1million to charities of their choice.

But it quickly emerged that the battle centred around Milly’s parents was not just against the newspaper behind the hacking of their daughter’s phone, but an entire industry.

Riding on the back of public sympathy for their plight, the Hacked Off campaign was by now in full cry.

Launched by self-appointed media watchdog the Media Standards Trust, its aim was to force a full-scale public inquiry into hacking and Press standards generally.

To amplify its voice, the celebrity victims of media intrusion were put at the forefront of the campaign – Hugh Grant, J K Rowling and Steve Coogan.

But when it came to putting pressure on the politicians, the involvement of the Dowlers would prove critical.

A month after the Dowlers had given evidence at Leveson, a senior News International executive accused the Guardian of 'sexing' up its story about News of the World journalists deleting messages from Milly Dowler's phone

Within a week of the Guardian story the couple, accompanied by representatives of Hacked Off, had met all three party leaders.

The Prime Minister then announced the Leveson Inquiry.

When it convened in November 2011, there again were Hacked Off’s roster of celebrity victims, led by Grant, by now their cheerleader-in-chief.

The Dowlers also attended, giving heartbreaking testimony. Mrs Dowler recounted the night of March 24, 2002, when she rang her daughter’s mobile phone and found fresh space was available on its previously full voicemail account.

She shouted to her husband: ‘She’s picked up her voicemail, Bob. She’s alive!’

The previously automated response had reverted to Milly’s own greeting. The sound of her daughter’s voice led Mrs Dowler to believe Milly had deleted some messages (something later blamed on the actions of News of the World journalists).

A month after the Dowlers had given evidence at Leveson, a senior News International executive accused the Guardian of ‘sexing’ up its story about News of the World journalists deleting messages from Milly Dowler’s phone.

Lord Leveson said the messages were probably deleted automatically by the mobile network operator

‘The Metropolitan Police has now confirmed that the News of the World was not to blame for deleting the specific mobile phone messages of Milly Dowler that gave false hope too her parents that she was alive,’ he said.

The Guardian was forced to print an apology.

The following May, Scotland Yard’s Chief Inspector John MacDonald said in a statement to the Leveson Inquiry: ‘We cannot conclusively say whether any voicemails were manually deleted.’

And in his report, Lord Leveson accepted as much, saying the voicemail messages were in fact probably deleted automatically by the mobile network operator.

‘The inquiry does conclude on the lower standard of proof of the balance of probabilities that tampering with or illegal interception of Milly Dowler’s voicemail was not the cause of the “false hope moment”,’ he wrote.

Yet Hacked Off and its supporters dismissed the revelation as a minor detail.

After all they had got their inquiry and the report they wanted. All they needed now was to force the political parties to accept the Leveson recommendations in their entirety – and once again the Dowlers’ name was key.

Last week it emerged that the campaign group had made extraordinary threats against Labour in an attempt to ‘sabotage’ cross-party agreement on Press reform.

The group threatened to publish a statement in which victims of phone hacking led by the Dowlers would condemn Ed Miliband, Harriet Harman and Nick Clegg in the strongest terms for agreeing to a ‘dirty deal’.

Concerns about Hacked Off’s motives were heightened yesterday after a secret dossier drawn up by the group was leaked to the Mail on Sunday.

In it there is a discussion of how the Dowlers can be used to pressurise the Prime Minister. It concludes: ‘It is in their name that we act.’

Given the events of the past few days, some might argue that Hacked Off should remind itself of that final phrase.
