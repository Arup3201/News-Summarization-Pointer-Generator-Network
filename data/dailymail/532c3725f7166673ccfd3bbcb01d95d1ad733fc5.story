President Barack Obama's persistent sore throat - which saw him whisked to a military hospital by motorcade for a CAT scan on Saturday - was caused by acid reflux,  the White House has said.

Obama, 53, reportedly underwent a fiber optic exam  by an ear, nose and throat specialist at the Washington residence on Saturday morning after complaining of a sore throat for two weeks.

He was then driven via motorcade to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where a CAT scan was performed. The results came back normal, it is said.

Now, Obama's physician Dr Ronny Jackson, director of the White House Medical Unit, has revealed that the exams' combined results show  that the president is suffering from acid reflux.

'The president's symptoms are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux and will be treated accordingly,' Mr Jackson said, without elaborating on subsequent treatment.

Acid reflux is caused when  the muscle fibers in the lower esophagus do not close properly, causing the contents of the stomach to flow back up the esophagus. This often leads to severe heartburn.

Other symptoms include nausea after eating, coughing and difficulty swallowing. Treatments involve avoiding certain foods and using over-the-counter or prescription medications, like antacids.

In a statement, Mr Jackson said the fiber optic exam, carried out at the White House shortly after Obama awoke, revealed 'soft tissue swelling' in the back of the president's throat.

Hospital: Following the fiber optic exam, two medical experts determined 'further evaluation with a routine CT scan was prudent'. Above, Obama with aide Bobby Schmuck (right) outside the Walter Reed center in July

He and the unidentified ENT specialist from the Fort Belvoir Medical Center in Northern Virginia then determined that 'further evaluation with a routine CT scan was prudent', he said.

The scan results came back normal, he added.

However, ABC News's Chief Medial and Health Editor, Dr Richard Besser, said that Obama's hospital tests 'did not hold true with what you'd normally see' in the case of a sore throat.

Acid reflux is caused when the muscle fibers in the lower esophagus do not close properly, causing the contents of the stomach to flow back up the esophagus.

This often leads to severe heartburn and a sore throat. Other symptoms include nausea after eating, coughing and difficulty swallowing.

There are many risk factors for the condition.

Smoking, alcohol and hiatal hernia all increase the risk of developing acid reflux, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

For treatment, sufferers are often told to avoid certain foods and use over-the-counter or prescription medications, like antacids.

'Normally for a sore throat, initially you'll do a test for strep. If it goes on for a couple of weeks, you might do a scope, but not a CT,' he said.

'It may be that he is a former smoker, he's the president of the United States - you'll often see presidents get extra testing.' 

Obama's departure to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at 2pm caught reporters off guard. It is unusual for a president to seek medical care outside of the White House.

The president was reportedly at the hospital for half an hour, before being driven back to the residence in the rainy weather.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr Jackson had suggested Obama have the diagnostic test done on Saturday afternoon because he had free time in his schedule.

Rain had kept Obama off the golf course, where he spends most Saturdays when the weather permits, said Mr Earnest. 

'The quickly scheduled test is a matter of convenience for the president, not a matter of urgency,' Earnest said. In May, Obama had a physical exam and was said to be in excellent health. 

Although Mr Jackson did not give a cause for Obama's case of acid reflux, there are many risk factors for the condition.

These include smoking, the use of alcohol and hiatal hernia, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

Mr Besser said the type of treatment the president will receive in coming days depends on the severity of his symptoms and how long he has been experiencing them.

For a 'slow approach', 'you would have him raise the head of his bed, stop smoking, if he's still smoking, cut down on alcohol and cut back on those foods that are causing problems,' he said.

He added that Obama would be prescribed medication only if the above steps did not work.
