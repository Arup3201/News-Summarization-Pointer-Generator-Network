Manchester United's players will be worked into the ground during 'enormously intense' 75-minute bursts by Louis van Gaal when the Dutchman takes charge in July.

That is the message from Robin van Persie, who expects the Holland coach to repair the damage left behind by David Moyes during a disastrous campaign in charge.

United finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to win any major silverware but their under-performing flops will be strenuously put through their paces when Van Gaal rocks up at Carrington.

Out of breath? Robin van Persie has warned Man United players of the intensity of Louis van Gaal's sessions

Main man: Van Persie revealed that individual training bursts are usually 75 minutes long

Having a little chat: Van Gaal doesn't take any prisoners and was pictured talking with Nigel De Jong in training

Talking it through: Van Gaal puts an arm around Van Persie in a bid to try and get his message across

Don't argue! Van Persie will be Holland's captain when they kick off their tournament in June

Van Persie - who will be Van Gaal's captain when the World Cup kicks off next month - laid bare the volume of training the 62-year-old demands.

'Every training session is very intense. He is on our backs every minute. There is no space to relax, he demands full focus,' Van Persie told The Sun.

'We work very hard for a maximum 1.25 hour, never longer. But these 75 minutes are enormously intense.'

Van Gaal's arrival at Old Trafford is certain to ruffle some feathers. He is renowned for an uncompromising nature.

That means dependable players - see Van Persie - are looked after well. It could be that the striker is made United skipper when the season begins in August, and he is certainly making the right noises.

Van Persie cut a frustrated figure in spells last season under Moyes and there was talk of the former Arsenal man moving on. The new arrival, however, has ended all speculation.

'I never had a relationship with a coach like I have with Van Gaal - it's very special,' the forward added.

His comments show just how high Van Persie regards the international boss, but also points towards difficulties with Moyes and Arsene Wenger while at the Emirates Stadium before a Â£24million move up north in 2012.

What do you mean?! Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and the rest will be put through their paces in pre-season
