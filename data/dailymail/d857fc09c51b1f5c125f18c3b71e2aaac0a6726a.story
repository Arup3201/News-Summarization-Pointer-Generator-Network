I am covered top-to-toe in a gloopy mess of tomato juice and mud. Pieces of tomato and tomato skin are stuck to my skin. There are infinite pips in my hair, ears, and various other crevices.

I have just taken part in a La Tomatina-style fight in the far corner of the Glastonbury Festival site.

This is where only the bravest of the brave venture, knowing that they will come out smothered - to face either ridiculous queues for a shower, or a day-long baby wipe session, afterwards.

Yet I am laughing joyously like a child in a sandpit, safe in the knowledge that I will be heading back to my very own bathroom and incredibly comfortable double bed.

In fact, in an ultimate act of smug rebellion, on arrival back at Snoozebox, the newest and closest pop-up hotel to the famous festival site, I decide to do a mud slide and get as dirty as possible.

Because I can.

The luxury of a fully-functioning private bathroom and plush bed is just one awesome perk that comes with staying in a Snoozebox at Glastonbury.

The pop-up consists of around 30 adjoining compact rooms.

They each feature everything you might need for a stress-free stay, including wifi, LCD TV, air conditioning and heating, en-suite wet-room with hot shower, personal safe, power sockets, fresh towels and sheets daily (thanks to a turn-down service), and complimentary toiletries.

Outside, a paved pathway leads to a greenhouse-marquee structure that they call the 'social area' - basically a reception/breakfast room with tables, chairs and sofas perfect for catching up with everyone. There, you will find at least one or two chirpy and helpful staff, seemingly at any hour.

Aside from providing great company, the Snoozebox team serve a hot breakfast each morning, ferry guests to and from the festival site in a swanky BMW at a phone call's notice, and are always on hand with any hot or cold snacks, booze or soft drinks that anyone requires – including prosecco and delicious Rebel Kitchen coconut mylks (perfect for a hangover). It is all included in the package.

It should be, too. Those staying at Snoozebox for the full five days of the festival will be investing almost £2,000 for the privilege - but will save a considerable amount on food and drink (especially alcohol). The festival ticket is not included.

I embrace the haven fully. Each day, I get up for breakfast, head out to the festival at around midday, head back to Snoozebox for a rest, snack and pre-drinks at around 5 or 6 - and dash back out to see some awesome music and creative arts at about 8 or 9. Even if you miss the 1.30am shuttle curfew, a cab back to the hotel is around £6, or a 15-20 minute walk up the road.

It is worth bearing in mind that the site for the pop-up is based just outside the north-east corner of the (absolutely massive) festival site. So allow yourself a good hour to get from A to B.

The distance strikes a fine balance between not-too-far-to-get-to and far-enough-away-for-some-genuine-privacy-and-peace. This makes it ideal for festival fans, artists and music professionals alike. Every now and again, somewhat surreally, I spot a face at breakfast who I will be watching on the Pyramid stage later that day.

Furthermore, it seems that extensive walking is, in general, a done-thing at Glastonbury, wherever you may be residing. The size of the site is immense - and it needs to be to cater for the prolific and diverse stalls and entertainment on offer.

There is an abundance of experiences, 
aside from some of the finest music acts in the world. You
 can easily ignore the bands entirely, but still have an awesome time.

But in five days, it is impossible to explore the whole place, or see and enjoy everything fully - which is bittersweet.

There is a circus, plus comedy and cabaret tents - where you find acrobats, jokers and dancers. Children's tents provide fun and games for the little ones, and you find hippies strumming guitars and embracing environmental issues at the Stone Circle and Greenpeace areas.

While Kasabian totally outdo themselves with a faultless headline set of back-to-back anthems, complete with a Noel Fielding cameo, I end up falling equally head-over-heels for an altogether more surreal area - the dark and very adult south-east corner.

Shangri-La - or, more specifically, its sub-section Shangri Hell - is an installation staffed entirely by method actors. Mullet-haired bouncers at a metal club called 66Sick will only let you in if you know the best guitar amp to buy. Elsewhere, there are inked-up goths manning a dive called No Tattoo No Entry - who will only allow you access if, you guessed it, you flash them a tattoo. 

The best club is a
 place called the HR Department, where a woman at front desk will ask 
if you have an appointment, before letting you in. The DJ is dressed 
like Richard Ayoade from the IT crowd doing paperwork between tracks. 
'Staff' and ravers alike pass files and folders back and forth, and 
every now and again the 'fire alarm' will go off, and everyone will be
 'evacuated'.

Great fun - but is is lovely to come home to cosy comfort after such a mad night.

Despite the genuine pilgrimage of the walk it takes to get there, I end up making the journey three or four times, happy that I am burning off all those calories from the insanely delicious (though pricey - £7 for a chicken wrap, for example) festival food on offer.

In letting you take time out from the festival site in the morning and evening, Snoozebox allows you to experience more, not less, of Glastonbury.

The combination of hot food, comfortable rest, companionship and camaraderie recharges batteries to the point that you can keep going till 6 or 7am each night - all the way to Sunday.

If you can stomach the price, there is no longer any reason to camp.
