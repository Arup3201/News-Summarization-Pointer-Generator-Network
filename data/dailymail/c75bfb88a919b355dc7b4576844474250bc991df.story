Chinese officials used a presidential visit to smuggle ivory out of Tanzania, an environmental watchdog has said.

Diplomats and businessmen bought so much illegal ivory during the visit by President Xi Jinping in 2013 that local prices doubled, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) found.

Ivory is a highly prized status symbol in China, which is the biggest importer of smuggled tusks. Tanzania is the largest source of poached ivory.

Chinese-led criminal gangs conspired with corrupt Tanzanian officials to traffic thousands of kilos of ivory, some of which was loaded in diplomatic bags on Xi's plane during the presidential visit, the EIA report said.

The illicit trade began to explode in China in 2008, when Beijing was permitted to purchase 62 tons of ivory under the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species.

The purchase was presented as a way to keep alive China's traditional artisan ivory carving industry.

A state-owned enterprise was authorized to sell the legal ivory to about 200 licensed factories and vendors.

But, after legal pieces started showing up in shops, ivory soon became a status symbol in China.

Carved ivory has historically been highly prized in China, and its scarcity has turned it into an investment choice akin to gold and silver.

Critics say the legal stockpile of ivory has provided a convenient cover for a thriving black market in recent years.

Although there have been efforts in Beijing to end the illegal trade, the licensing system in China is flawed and enforcement is lax, said Grace Ge Gabriel, Asian regional director for International Fund for Animal Welfare.
