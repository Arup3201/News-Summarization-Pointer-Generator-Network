These are the images that define credit crunch Britain - or so says a photographer who travelled 16,000 miles visiting towns and cities across the country to see how one of the biggest fiscal meltdowns in living memory affected the average person on the street.

Snapper Si Barber embarked on an investigative project to document the real people of the UK and compiled them in a new book which takes its title from David Cameron's much maligned policy idea, 'The Big Society'

The photographer began his journey after the collapse of Northern Rock and the start of the financial crisis in 2007. Over the next five years Barber took pictures of Morris Dancers behind safety signs, tattooed EDL activists and lines of trolleys outside closed down shops.

Changing nation: Morris dancers in Norfolk were

used for inhaling the addictive drug

Hard times: Barber stopped by at a Kwik Save store in Blackpool, Lancashire, the chain was a victim of the credit crunch, going into administration in 2007 before reopening in 2012

Religious message: In Salford, the face of Hollywood actress Claudia Schiffer, appearing in an advert for luxury cosmetics brand L'Oreal, was obscured by a painting of a hijab

Speaking at the end of his journey, Barber said: 'I started at the same time David Cameron launched his Big Society project, as a polemic.

'I have spent the past few years zipping around the country, looking for things to picture.

The results as shocking as they are revealing. Barber’s collection displays a mixture of endearing photographs and more startling ones of religious graffiti and home made drug tools' funerals.

Si said: 'The picture of the make shift crack pipe, made out of a Coke can, was taken in leafy Cambridge, a five minute walk from King’s college. It really is surprising what it going on.

'At times it was quite depressing. And there were lots of surprises. It was almost as if I was the one going around blind.

'My ambition is to run my Big Society as long as David Cameron’s is running his. To show the reality.

Sign of the times: Barber saw many derelict houses on his travels around the UK, but this building in Peterborough struck a chord

Under watch: This CCTV camera outside a bedroom in Kings Lynn, Norfolk was significant to Barber because the town was the first in the UK to install the cameras in 1987

David Cameron launched his Big Society in 2010 as a scheme to empower communities, something he said he was 'great passion.'

The Prime Minister wanted dormant bank accounts to be used to help fund post offices, libraries and other community facilities, which would be organised and run by local people.

But while Cameron's idea has been brushed under the carpet in recent years, Barber has quietly been photographing the state of the country.

He said: 'The Big Society pictures not the movers or the shakers, but those surviving the will of the powerful. The shop workers made to dance for their employers each morning. 

'The prostitutes stumbling around the 
darkened streets of Bradford looking for punters. The skivers and the 
dead squaddies, the lucky and the losers.'

Queen of hearts: This picture of a tribute to the late Lady Diana shows how her death moved modern Britain. To this day, tourists still come to London to leave tributes to the iconic Royal

Divisive: Pictures of an English Defence League activist, left, with the cross of St George tattooed onto his shaven head features in the collection showing a sinister side to the political divide in Britain. Those images sit alongside more light-hearted portraits, like one of a conker enthusiast, right, at the world championships in Ashton

Land protest: Farmers in Cumbria use a scarecrow to protest against imported food and crops. The British agriculture industry was heavily affected by the global financial crisis

Some of Si’s pictures have more of a lighthearted tone and capture quirks and traditions which make Great Britain interesting, including tribute acts, tattoos and conker hats.

Si has produced a book full of his work which contains more then 70 images and he is still going- snapping iconic pictures of Brits, to add to his large collection.

Si said: 'I love taking photographs and it is amazing the characters I have encountered along the way. I want to keep showing the truth behind the Big Society.'
