When Czech artist Jakub Hadrava was asked to help transform a dilapidated village church, he knew he would have his work cut out.

Thankfully he came up with a frightfully good idea.

Mr Hadrava has helped secure the future of the 14th century St George's church in Lukova after creating a spooky art installation that features a collection of hooded 'ghosts' that line the pews and aisles.

Czech artist Jakub Hadrava was commissioned to create artwork that would attract visitors to St George's church in Lukova

Since his work was added to the medieval building over the summer, the church has seen a huge influx of tourists from counties as far away as Brazil, Australia and Germany.

The thousands of visitors who have turned up have now left behind enough money to get much needed repair work done to the church. 

The church, which is in the north-western Bohemia region of the Czech Republic, had initially fallen into disrepair in 1968 after the roof collapsed during a funeral service.

The ghosts are made out of plaster and fill the pews and the aisle of the church which was built in 1352

Hadrava said the figures represent the ghosts of Sudeten Germans who lived in Lukova before World War Two and who came to pray at this church every Sunday

Convinced that this was an omen, locals in the area abandoned it, preferring to carry out sermons and masses outside.

But after four decades local artist Mr Hadrava was brought in to attract visitors and investment.

Renovation work has now started and local council officials are confident the church's future is now secure.

Jakub said: 'I wanted to make the church more attractive for visitors and try to raise some money for renovation work.

'The figures represent the ghosts of Sudeten Germans who lived in Lukova before World War Two and who came to pray at this church every Sunday.

'I hope to show the world that this place had a past and it was a normal part of everyday life, but that fate has a huge influence on our lives.'

Hadrava's instalation is now drawing in crowds from all over the world, raising funds for the church's repair

The church manager said the attraction was proving popular with visitors from Germany and the UK

Voluntary church manager Petr Koukl, 59, said: 'Foreigners are particularly interested in the church and there have been many visitors from Germany, the UK, Australia and even Brazil.

'It is a beautiful building with original pillars from the 14th century.

'Unfortunately, many things have over the years being stolen.

'But the money we make from visitors is allowing us to eventually restore the church to what it once was.'

Local Radomir Sedlacek, 59, said: 'It's certainly hair-raising, let's hope it will continue to be cash-raising too.'
