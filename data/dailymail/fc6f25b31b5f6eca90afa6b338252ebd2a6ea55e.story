The day before Stefan Zeestraten was killed in a car crash – he was making furniture in preparation for his daughter’s arrival in three weeks but now his partner, Gemma Nicholson, must face parenthood for the first time alone.

Heartfelt tributes are flowing on a memorial Facebook page dedicated to the 24-year-old New Zealand dairy farmer with many expressing condolences to his devastated partner of four years.

Mr Zeestraten’s friend Grant Jackson said the Winton community, who farewelled Mr Zeestraten at a service today, was in deep shock at the loss of the first-time expectant father who had everything ahead of him.

Mr Zeestraten's friend Grant Jackson said the Winton community was in deep shock at the loss of the first time expectant father who had everything ahead of him

‘He was at a turning point in his life, he was three weeks away from becoming a dad and he was really looking forward to that,’ he told stuff.co.nz. ‘In fact the day before we lost him he spent the day putting together children's furniture for the upcoming arrival.’

Mr Zeestraten left early from a barbecue at his cousin's house in Winton on Monday after feeling unwell and began his short 2km trip in his four-wheel-drive Toyota Land Cruiser when he hit a power pole at about midnight.

Mr Jackson said although it was unknown what caused the crash, his family and friends could guarantee it was not an alcohol – related incident.

‘One thing you can speculate is that it was because of black ice, it was one of the best frosts in Southland this winter that night, but there was no way alcohol was involved because Stefan wasn't drinking because he felt that crook,’ he said.

He described the successful farm manager, whose family emigrated to New Zealand almost 17 years ago from Holland, as mature beyond his years.

‘He never had a bad thing to say about anyone. Even if we tried to think of anything negative about Stefan, we can't, he's just one of those guys who is that perfect,’ he said.
