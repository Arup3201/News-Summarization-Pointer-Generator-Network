A new season offers players a fresh start, a chance to banish a nightmare campaign from the previous year or show the world that they are not just a flash in the pan. It’s time to rescue careers and build some others.

Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea)

Both Courtois and Petr Cech have a point to prove, but after all the trophies Cech has won I would say the pressure is on Courtois. He has done everything he can on loan but now he has to prove he is the present and future. One slip and Cech will be breathing down his neck.

Target: Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois has to reproduce the type of form that caught in the eye in Spain

Kyle Walker (Tottenham)

Two years ago Walker was the PFA Young Player of the Year and an England regular but he has not played for his country for nearly a year. He has had injury problems but his game has not developed as quickly as he’d have liked and he needs to improve defensively.

Improvements: Tottenham's Kyle Walker still has to work on his defensive play

Phil Jones (Man Utd)

He arrived as the next Duncan Edwards but he has not lived up to that billing so far. It doesn’t help that his role in the team is undefined and injuries have hindered his progress, but if manager Louis van Gaal shows belief in him as a pure centre back, he can prosper.

Belief: Manchester United defender Phil Jones could prosper with a run at centre back

Test: Defender Chris Smalling has failed to build on an impressive start at Manchester United

Chris Smalling (Man Utd)

Similar to Jones, Smalling has not pushed on as he might have hoped. Their lack of development left England with a gaping defensive hole at the World Cup — they were not ready. But Van Gaal improved Holland’s defence and he can do the same with Smalling.

Tom Ince (Hull City)

A lot has been said about the young Ince but now he has to live up to the hype. His loan move to Palace didn’t really work last season but you have to admire him for turning down Inter Milan for the chance to play regularly at Hull. If he doesn’t, shine, he’ll be back in the Championship.

Jack Colback (Newcastle)

He was impressive at Sunderland last year but it takes a brave man to cross the Wear to Newcastle, especially on a free. Sol Campbell faced bitter abuse when he joined Arsenal from Spurs, let’s hope Jack does not suffer as much. The only way to keep people quiet is to play well.

Big opportunity: Midfielder Jack Rodwell can finally fulfill his potential at Sunderland

Jack Rodwell (Sunderland)

He has been considered a hot prospect for too long and now he has a chance to prove his worth. His career stalled when he left Everton for Man City, so with regular football this season he can show us his undoubted talent. He needs to lose his reputation of being injury-prone.

Joe Cole (Aston Villa)

His homecoming at West Ham never really went to plan, so much so his boyhood club were happy to release him in the summer. Now at Villa, he has to show he’s still got the ability that once made him one of the most exciting English midfielders of his generation.

Ability: Veteran Joe Cole still has the talent to light up the Premier League

Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton)

When you spend the summer sulking because you can’t move clubs, you have to prove you are worth the hassle. Whether he stays at Southampton or gets his move to Tottenham, Schneiderlin needs to knuckle down and forget about all of this.

Jack Wilshere (Arsenal)

The biggest problem for Jack has been staying fit. He takes the game to the opposition and to do that you need to be in supreme condition. Because he’s so talented he’s been able to get by but after a good pre-season, now he can show that explosive pace again.

Point to prove: Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has to rediscover his explosive pace

Challenge: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge now has to show he can lead the line without Luis Suarez

Focus: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers must build on second place finish last season

Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool)

After the season he had last time out, you might not think he has much to prove. But now he has to show he can lead the line without Luis Suarez. There’s no doubting his ability but he needs to become Liverpool’s No1 goalscorer, Mr Reliable.

Brendan Rodgers (Liverpool, manager)

Rodgers said last year it wasn’t just about Luis Suarez, it was about a team — now he has to prove it. He plays to win and always encourages his teams to attack. I enjoy watching his sides go forward but he needs to show last season was not a one-off.

Roy Keane (Aston Villa, asst manager)

It’s back to the day-to-day life of football now for Roy and it will be fascinating to see how he gets on, particularly with Paul Lambert. He’s not making decisions, so it will be a new perspective and he really needs a positive experience in club management after some failures.

Upheaval: Morgan Schneiderlin must knuckle down at Southampton... or Tottenham

Big call: Tom Ince made a bold decision to snub Inter Milan and sign for Hull City

Perspective: New Aston Villa No 2 Roy Keane needs to make a positive impact
