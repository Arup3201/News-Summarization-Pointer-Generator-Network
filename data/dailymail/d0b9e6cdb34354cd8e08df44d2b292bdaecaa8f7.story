Eva Mendes is undoubtedly one of the most desirable women in the world, and has even managed to bag one of Hollywood's hottest men to boot.

The 39-year-old, who has just launched her own clothing line, is gracing the cover of The Edit magazine this month. In the interview, she opens up about the launch of her eponymous 
fashion line, the style rules she lives by and her love for fellow actress
Penelope Cruz and director, Pedro Almodóvar.

This week’s edition of Net-a-Porter’s digital publication features the American actress looking stunning in in new-season pieces by Dolce & Gabbana, Anna Sui, Gucci and Alexander McQueen.

With smokey eye make-up and her hair piled high on her head in a bouffant style, Eva smoulders in the Gothic-style shoot which also features clothes by Moschino, Valentino and Alessandra Rich.

Eva is about to embark on her first 
fashion venture, a line which is exclusive to retailer New York & 
Company. She explains, “I’m particular about who I lend my name to.” Before agreeing to it, she sought the advice of her mother and sisters: 'Everybody 
was like, "This is amazing!"'

Directly inspired from Mendes’ own retro-chic style, the
line starts at just $24.95 (£15.50) for one of her  a seamless 
camisole and goes up to $159.95 (£100) for her statement piece, the Milano one-button coat in on-trend pale pink.

There are
also jewellery pieces, belts and Eva’s number one must-have, a 
colourful printed scarf, which are all priced at around $20 (£12).

Eva
explains that when it comes to her own style she focuses on the little 
details, such as a pair of treasured earrings which belonged to her late
grandmother: 'I get fixated on things.'

Always
elegant on the red carpet, she says that for 
eveningwear, she adheres to two basic rules: 'If you go short, no 
cleavage or anything super-fitted; if you’re covered from head to toe, 
you can go as fitted as you like.’ 

Raised as a Catholic, Mendes entertained the notion of becoming a nun and an astronaut before she began her career in Hollywood as an actress.

She reflects, 'At the beginning it was tricky – I had to choose between paying the rent sometimes and having artistic integrity. [But] I’ve always worked with great people'

Of her her turn as Romina in The Place Beyond the Pines, she says: 'It was the first time I felt like I’d played a real person.'

Eva explains: 'When I saw the film, I thought, "Oh my God, that’s a real woman with real struggles and torture behind her eyes." That was big for me.’

Filming The Place Beyond the Pines also introduced her to boyfriend Ryan Gosling; the two became close on set and have just finished working on Gosling’s directional debut How to Catch a Monster. Eva, who plays Cat, describes the experience as simply, 'incredible'.

Of Gosling himself, Eva will only say, 'I’m such a weirdo. I literally lose my ability to speak… I live in a very protective kind of bubble that I’ve created for myself.'

The only signs that their relationship is going strong, are their two dogs sitting by her side, Hugo (Eva’s) and George (Gosling’s), who she describes as 'my loves'.
