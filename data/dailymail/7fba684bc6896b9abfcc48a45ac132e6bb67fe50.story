For all of the exotic and far-reaching places on the globe, from the highest of peaks to the most remote beaches, a humble British train is among the most adventurous places to pop the question.

Travel guide Wanderlust has listed 10 top locations to ask your loved one to be your one and only one that will ensure your proposal story will be one that lives on forever just in time for Valentine's Day, and the Belmond Royal Scotsman train is the UK's only inclusion. 

On the list at a not shabby at all eighth place, the Royal Scotsman is not just any train but a brilliant way to see the Highlands and beyond. 

It is listed by the website behind a top three that includes hot-air ballooning over the temples of Bagan in Burma, Iguazu Falls on the borders of Brazil and Argentina and the Unesco World Heritage-listed parks of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.

The Belmond Royal Scotsman train has been listed among the most adventurous places in the world to propose

'The Royal Scotsman train is known as one of the most lavish ways to travel in Europe,' raves Wanderlust. 'Mahogany clads the train interior and tartan furnishings speckle the decks.

'Choose from five different itineraries, and just wait for that perfect moment to pop the question... while exploring castles in the Highlands, perhaps, or searching for Nessie at Loch Ness? The train itself, coupled with the incredible Scottish wilderness, makes any journey spectacular.' 

Talk about getting a marriage off on the right track. 

As with anything connected to nuptials, even a proposal, the Royal Scotsman isn't a cheap location to get down on one knee with prices ranging from £930 for the two-day 'Majestic England' trip between London and Edinburgh to £9200 for the eight-day Grand Tour of Britain that goes to Scotland, England and Wales.

Other set journeys on board the nine-car train include the 'Classic' that goes to the Highlands, castles, the village of Plockton and the Cairngorms, the 'Western' covering Loch Lomond, Ben Nevis, Morar and Isle of Bute, the 'Highlands' overlooking stunning scenery and visiting a famed distillery.

The dining car of the Royal Scotsman with its mahogany and tartan design - could this be the ideal table at which to pop the question? 

The Scotsman traverses some of the most picturesque landscapes in Britain with prices costing from £930 for Edinburgh to London trip

Options for getting down on one knee include the dining cars, named Victory and Raven, the observation car or one of the scenic locations it visits. 

'Indulge in afternoon tea while sharing stories with fellow guests as the train journeys on,' goes the Royal Scotsman's promotional spiel. 'Nightfall brings cocktails and candlelit dinners before retiring to your cosy cabin to dream of the next day's adventures.'

If that hasn't inspired you or your love of trains isn't worthy of such an auspicious occasion though, here are some more options from Wanderlust. 

How about in At.mosphere, two levels below the observation deck of the world's tallest building the Burj Khalifa in Dubai? 

Hot air ballooning over Bagan in Burma is No 1 on Wanderlust's most adventurous places to propose marriage

Ballooning is a popular and spectacular way of seeing the ancient city with a range of tour operators offering flights from about £210 

Iguacu Falls in Brazil and Argentina is best seen from a helicopter which can cost from £147 for a panoramic flight through Viator

Or in Finland with the sparkling ring worth several weeks pay sparkling in the colours of the Northern Lights? 

Some more unusual options include not Paris but the Alps villages of Le Monal, Wanderlust's 'most romantic place in France'.

Also listed ahead of the Scotsman is Sungai Lebam, in the wetlands area of the Malaysian Peninsula, where a private boat tour among the mangroves in the moonlight is about as romance-inducing as it gets. 

Behind hitting the rails in the Highlands is the peak of Morocco's snow-capped Mount Toubkal, north Africa's highest mountain, and the 27-mile-long Matanuska Glacier in Alaska, 'home to some spectacular features like ice falls, moulins, crevasses and ice caves'.

Not Paris but the hamlet of Le Monal is the 'most romantic place in France,' says Wanderlust in their list of top places to propose

North Africa's highest peak, Mount Toubkal in Morocco is also one of its most beautiful and romantic - perfect to pop the question

And rounding out the list, the 27 mile-long and four miles wide Matanuska Glacier in Alaska, the largest glacier in the US accessible by car
