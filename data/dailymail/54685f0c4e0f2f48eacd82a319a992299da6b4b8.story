We all know someone in the office who could do with washing under their arms, but more than a million lucky Britons could go without deodorant... and remain daisy fresh.

These fragrant folk don't produce smelly B.O (body odour) due to a genetic defect, researchers say.

Despite this nearly eight out of 10 of them still wear deodorant because it is seen as the 'cultural norm'.

It's the pits: Most of us have been exposed to appalling body odour at some point, but one in 50 don't smell

Scientists say they are wasting their money and a simple gene test would show purchasing the personal hygiene product is unnecessary.

A study of 6,495 women found 117 - about one in 50 - carry a rare mutated version of a gene known as ABCC11 which means they do not produce any underarm odour.

Although 26 said they do not use a deodorant 78 per cent do on all or most days, reports the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.

Professor Ian Day, of the University of Bristol, said: 'An important finding of this study relates to those individuals who, according to their genotype, do not produce underarm odour.

'One quarter of these individuals must 
consciously or subconsciously recognise that they do not produce odour 
and do not use deodorant, whereas most odour producers do use deodorant.

Although one in 50 don't need deodorants, 80 per cent of them still use them

'However, three-quarters of those who do not produce an odour regularly use deodorants. We believe these people simply follow socio-cultural norms.

'This contrasts with the situation in North East Asia, where most people do not need to use deodorant and they don't.'

The research was based on a sample of women who are part of the wider Children of the 90s study at the University of Bristol.

People who carry the variant are also more likely to have dry, rather than sticky, ear wax and checking this is a good indicator of whether or not a person produces underarm odour.

Researcher Dr Santiago Rodriguez added: 'These findings have some potential for using genetics in the choice of personal hygiene products.

'A simple gene test might strengthen self awareness and save some unnecessary purchases and chemical exposures for non odour producers.'

Previous studies have shown there is a link between a genetic variant located in the ABCC11 gene and underarm odour.

Some glands produce sweat which, combined with bacteria, result in underarm odour. The production of odour depends on the existence of an active ABCC11 gene. But the gene is known to be inactive in some people.

About five per cent of people who produce an odour do not use deodorant.
