Roy Hodgson is poised to recall Theo Walcott to the England squad even through the Arsenal winger has not started a game since suffering a serious knee injury in January.

Walcott was on the bench for Arsenal’s 3-3 draw against Anderlecht on Tuesday, but has only played 10 minutes of football – against Burnley earlier this month – since damaging his cruciate knee ligaments in the FA Cup against Tottenham.

But Hodgson, who names his squad on Wednesday, is keen to bring him back to the international fold for the games against Slovenia and Scotland.

Having missed the World Cup and not played for his country for more than a year, Walcott will go with Arsene Wenger’s blessing as the Arsenal boss is keen to bring him up to speed as quickly as possible.

‘I’m happy for him to go with England, he needs competition and games,’ said the Frenchman. ‘For us, he needs hard training. Will I use him from the bench against Anderlecht? I haven’t decided yet.’ 

Wenger is also keen to tie Walcott down to a new contract - his second new contract in two years. 

The 25-year-old enters the final year of his contract at the end of the season, a scenario Arsenal are keen to avoid, and they have held initial discussions regarding an extension.

Wenger confirmed: ‘We are starting to sit down with him. He has one and a half years to go in December. It is never an easy job with him.

'It should be his best years from now because he is 25, so hopefully we can profit from that.

‘He is a unique player, a player who has been here a long time and who gives us something different. He has been tremendous for the last few seasons. To have him back can only be a bonus for me.’
