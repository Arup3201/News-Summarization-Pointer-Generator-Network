Liverpool fans will be licking their lips at the prospect of signings galore to strengthen their squad for an assault on the Champions League.

After guiding the Reds to a second-place finish in the Premier League, Brendan Rodgers is keen to bring in new faces with the likes of Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Alberto Moreno all linked with a move to Anfield.

But... a note of caution. Rodgers has made 14 signings since taking charge of Liverpool back in 2012, and only a couple of those have wowed the Kop.

Sportsmail's Sunni Upal assesses the Liverpool manager's signings so far.

The only way is up: Brendan Rodgers is looking to strengthen the Liverpool squad this summer

Fabio Borini (from Roma, £10.5million)

The Italian is a player Rodgers is keen on after the pair spent time together at Chelsea.

Borini arrived at Anfield as a 21-year-old who looked to have a big future, but he managed just one goal in the first part of the 2012-2013 season, against Gomel in a Europa League qualifier. It was a nightmare first season and injury threatened to curtail it in February.

The Italian returned ahead of schedule and finally scored his first Premier League goal in a 6-0 thrashing of Newcastle.

Having impressed for Italy at the European U21 Championship, Borini spent last season on loan at Sunderland. With his transfer fee not exactly on the small side, it would be easy to label him as a flop.

However, after scoring four goals in five games to help Sunderland to safety, there are indications the Italian could still make his mark in a red shirt.

VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT

Potential: Fabio Borini celebrates after scoring against Gomel in the Europa League

Joe Allen (from Swansea, £15million)

In an episode of the documentary series Being Liverpool, Rodgers referred to Allen as the 'Welsh Xavi'. Initially, the midfielder's range of passing was impressive but he soon lost his way and his only goals during his first season came against Oldham in the FA Cup and Zenit in the Europa League.

Having rarely featured at the start of last season after falling behind Jordan Henderson in the pecking order, Allen has had to fight his way back into the team. One game in particular stands out, and that was the 3-0 win at Old Trafford, during which he was brilliant.

The 24-year-old finished the campaign with a regular run in the team and finally scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool in a 3-3 draw at Crystal Palace.

Next season he must continue his end-of-season form.

VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT

On the mark: Joe Allen was given an extended run in the team at the end of last season

Oussama Assaidi (from Heerenveen, £2.4million)

The Moroccan struggled to break into the first team at Anfield during his first season, playing just four games in the Premier League. Assaidi spent last season on loan at Stoke where he made much of an impact. 

His last-minute winner for Stoke against Chelsea was appreciated by Liverpool fans, but, realistically, the chances of him breaking through at Anfield are very slim.

VERDICT - MISS

Outcast: Oussama Assaidi spent last season on loan at Stoke after failing to impress

Samed Yesil (from Bayer Leverkusen, £1million)

The German was highly rated by Rodgers and quickly pounced upon. Still only 20 years old, Yesil hasn't forced his way into first-team reckoning.

An anterior cruciate ligament injury ruined his season in the Under21 Premier League last year and he missed a lot of the season. There is still time for Yesil to show what he can do.

VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT

Talent: Samed Yesil, pictured playing in the Capital One Cup, was signed for £1million from Leverkusen

Daniel Sturridge (from Chelsea, £12million)

Instant hit. There's no better way to win over fans than to score goals. Sturridge did that straight away, registering in his first three games in a red shirt. 

After arriving in January, he scored 11 goals in the second half of the 2012-2013 season. Last year, though, he really made his mark. 

With Luis Suarez suspended for the first part of the season, Sturridge quickly lifted the mood with six goals in his first five games. When the Uruguayan returned the pair, labelled the 'SAS', were unstoppable. Sturridge finished the season with 25 goals in all competitions after finally being given an extended run as a striker.

VERDICT - HIT

Revelation: Daniel Sturridge was one of the hottest striker in Europe last season

Philippe Coutinho (from Inter, £8.5million)

Now, that price seems a bargain. The Brazilian is very similar to a Kop favourite from the recent past, Luis Garcia. His trickery, vision and incisive passing fit in very well with Rodgers' system.

One thing often overlooked, though, is big goals he scores, as Garcia did so often. Coutinho's deflected effort at Fulham brought Liverpool level before Steven Gerrard's injury-time penalty secured a 3-2 win. Talking of 3-2 victories, who scored the winner against Manchester City in April? Yep, Coutinho.

VERDICT - HIT

Vital: Philippe Coutinho scored the winner against Manchester City in a 3-2 win at Anfield

Tiago Ilori (from Sporting Lisbon, £7million)

Signed for £7million last summer, Ilori arrived at Anfield as a young central defender with huge promise. The 21-year-old is yet to earn his opportunity in the first team and spent the end of last season on loan at Granada. With Liverpool's defensive problems, Ilori could fight his wat into contention.

Push for the first team: Tiago Ilori (left) spent the end of last season on loan at Granada

Aly Cissokho (from Valencia, season-long loan)

With Jose Enrique compromised by a knee injury, Rodgers moved to bring in the French left back on loan as cover. But Cissokho was never solid enough and soon fell behind Jon Flanagan, who is more naturally comfortable at right back.

VERDICT - MISS

Cover: On-loan left-back Aly Cissokho lost his place to youngster Jon Flanagan

Victor Moses (from Chelsea, season-long loan)

Jose Mourinho had no idea that he was loaning out Moses to a title rival and a team that finished above his Chelsea side. Moses started well with a goal at Swansea, but his opportunities were limited. That was largely due to the emergence of Raheem Sterling.

VERDICT - MISS

Limited: Victor Moses was kept out of the Liverpool team by Raheem Sterling

Mamadou Sakho (from Paris Saint-Germain, £18million)

When the Frenchman arrived on Merseyside, Liverpool hailed Sakho as a 'marquee signing'. It has been a strange first season for Sakho. He has found himself in and out of the team, almost on rotation with Daniel Agger.

While Sakho still looks clumsy in possession and leaves fans with their heart in mouth every time he makes a challenge, there is talent there. After all, he captained Paris Saint-Germain as a teenager and is likely to start for France at the World Cup.

VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT

Solid as a rock? Mamadou Sakho was hailed as a 'marquee signing' when he arrived at Anfield

Kolo Toure (from Manchester City, free)

This initially looked like a good piece of business by Rodgers to bring in an experienced, hardened Premier League veteran on the cheap. 

But a couple of clangers in early 2014, most notably the own goal against Fulham and passing the ball across his own box to Victor Anichebe against West Brom, have reminded people how error prone he is.

At 33 years of age, Toure is unlikely to be find himself as a starter again.

VERDICT - MISS

Costly: Free signing Kolo Toure made a number of huge errors in the early part of 2014

Simon Mignolet (from Sunderland, £9million)

The Belgian had big shoes to fill at Liverpool. He stepped straight into a void left by Pepe Reina, who was first-choice goalkeeper at Anfield for eight years. Mignolet had a debut that dreams are made of, saving a penalty in the 89th minute to preserve Liverpool's 1-0 lead over Stoke.

Mignolet is an excellent shot stopper but, much like his back four, prone to mistakes. He rarely looked comfortable when claiming crosses and his howler to let in Alvaro Negredo's shot consigned Liverpool to a 2-1 defeat by Manchester City in December. Looking back at the final standings in the title race, those points seem pretty costly now.

VERDICT - RESERVING JUDGEMENT

Dream: Simon Mignolet saved a penalty on his Anfield debut that secured Liverpool three points

Iago Aspas (from Celta Vigo, £7.2million)

Due to the excellence of Suarez and Sturridge, Aspas really hasn't had a look in since September. Having said that, the Spaniard was given a decent run at the start of the season with Suarez suspended but couldn't score. In fact, his only goal all season came in the FA Cup against Oldham. With Liverpool looking to strengthen and Lambert's seemingly imminent arrival, there is only one way Aspas is heading in the pecking order.

VERDICT - MISS

Solitary: Iago Aspas's only goal last season came in the FA Cup against Oldham

Luis Alberto (from Sevilla, £6.8million)

Alberto had the kind of season that left many wondering what his favoured role is. A forward? A midfielder? winger? No 10? The Spaniard has made just nine Premier League appearances this season with most of those being from the bench. He is still only 21, but will have to work incredibly hard just to get noticed next season with a number of signings expected.

VERDICT - MISS

Bit part: Luis Alberto featured in just nine Premier League games for Liverpool last season
