Chelsea midfielder Marko Marin has agreed to yet another loan deal after joining Belgian champions Anderlecht.

Since his arrival at Stamford Bridge from Werder Bremen in 2012, the Germany international has made just six Premier League appearances for the Blues.

Following a loan spell with Sevilla last season, Marin was shipped out to Fiorentina for the first half of this term but failed to make an impact for Vincenzo Montella's side.

The 25-year-old made just four  appearances for the Italian club - all in the Europa League - and will ply his trade in the Belgian Pro League for the rest of this season.

But despite Marin's recent lack of first team football, Anderlecht's general manager Herman Van Holsbeeck was excited about his arrival.

'RSC Anderlecht goes for quality and not quantity,' he said.

'The arrival of Marko Marin is a win-win situation for both parties. Here he can play at the highest level and help the purple and white achieve its ambitions.'

The German international will make his third loan move since joining Chelsea from Werder Bremen in 2012
