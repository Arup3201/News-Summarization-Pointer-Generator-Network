David Cameron was all smiles as he stepped out of Downing Street to welcome news of the royal birth.

But the Prime Minister’s beaming address to the nation triggered speculation he has lost a front tooth.

Mr Cameron looked gap-toothed as he declared the birth ‘an important moment in the life of our nation’.

Mind the gap: Viewers watching David Cameron's statement on the royal baby thought it looked like he was missing a tooth

Senior government sources insisted the PM had not suffered a chipped tooth in the hours before news broke that the Duchess of Cornwall had given birth to a boy.

But viewers watching his statement were struck by what appeared to be a hole where his top left incisor should be.

It triggered speculation on Twitter about what had happened to Mr Cameron during an afternoon working in his Downing Street office.

Delight: The Prime Minister said a 'proud nation is celebrating with a very proud and happy couple'

Punch-up: Some Twitter users wondered if Mr Cameron had come off worse in a fight with Labour leader Ed Miliband

Distracting: Even people focussed on the news of the royal baby could not take their eyes off the PM's mouth

Shortly after news broke last night that a prince had been born, Mr Cameron emerged from Number 10 to add to the wave of congratulations.

The PM said: ‘It is wonderful news from St Mary’s, Paddington, and I am sure that right across the country, and indeed right across the Commonwealth, people will be celebrating and wishing the royal couple well.

‘It is an important moment in the life of our nation but I suppose above all it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy.

‘It has been a remarkable few years for our Royal Family - a royal wedding that captured people’s hearts, that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee and now this royal birth - all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service.

‘They can know that a proud nation is celebrating with a very proud and happy couple tonight.’

Questions: The Prime Miinster's appearance outside Number 10 sparked a flurry of speculation about his teeth

But viewers were distracted by what appeared to be a missing tooth.

Twitter user Jay Said it wrote: ‘Since when did David Cameron have a gap tooth?’

Mark Muir added: ‘David Cameron sporting a sore lip and a chipped tooth. Wonder what’s happened there?’

Becky Watson said: ‘Okay, this is very exciting, but was David Cameron missing a tooth in that BBC interview?! This truly is a good day.’

However it is believed Mr Cameron’s teeth are all where they should be, and the video clip was just a trick of the light on a small chip he sustained many years ago.

'They've always been like that for years,' said a source.
