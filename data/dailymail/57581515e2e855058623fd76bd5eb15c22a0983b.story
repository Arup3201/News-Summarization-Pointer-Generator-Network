A mother-of-two has made it her mission to brighten up other people's lives - by anonymously leaving gifts for strangers to find.

The generous woman has taken to carrying out good deeds around her hometown - which include leaving unused scratchcards on supermarket shelves and paying for other people's orders in cafes.

The mother, from Leyland, Lancashire, has even set up a Facebook and Twitter account to further her cause - but prefers to keep her identity a secret, even from her own husband.

Mystery mother: Spreading goodwill in her hometown of Leyland, Lancashire, a mother-of-two leaves an envelope containing money to pay for a coffee in a postbox outside a cafe 

She said: 'I've only told one friend, and that was to see what she thought and to help me come up with ideas. 

'I want to remain anonymous - I'm not interested in any glory, I just hope people enjoy it and it inspires others. 

'I read about other people doing it elsewhere in the country and I thought why not do it in my local town? 

'I don't have lots of money, I'm keeping it to simple things, but it's a nice thing that people aren't expecting.

She has launched a Facebook and Twitter page called Leyland RAOK (Random Acts of Kindness) - where details of her good deeds are posted.

Her hope is that she will inspire others by her charitable behaviour - ahead of National Random Acts of Kindness week, which starts on Monday.

Speaking about one of the deed, she added: 'We felt very conspicuous doing it. In the supermarket I made sure I had a bit of shopping with me and that no-one else was down the aisle, but it felt strange getting things out. 

'But then I thought that people mess about on their phones and with shopping lists all the time. Then at the car park I had no idea how much parking cost. I had an envelope and I had to pretend I was looking at the charges.

'I waited till it was quiet and nobody was looking, then I went and stuck the envelope on the machine. Then I realised I'd forgot to put the money in. Imagine how bad that would have looked!'

The mystery woman added: 'I'm enjoying it and it's nice to get feedback, but people are bound to be suspicious. 

'I saw a lady go up to the parking meter, look at the envelope and not open it. I'd probably be the same though, wondering what was going on. 

'But people should be on the look out, I'm aiming to do this long-term with a few things every week. The hardest part will be coming up with ideas.'

Her kindness is already rubbing off on others - as she discovered after leaving money to pay for a meal inside a postbox outside the Cowshed cafe in Buckshaw Village, Lancashire.

Kerry Booth, manager of The Cowshed, was handed the envelope to pay for the next customer's order. 

'We thought it was absolutely wonderful and we were very pleased to be able to pass the envelope on to two ladies who came in,' said Ms Booth. 

The cafe manager then decided to carry out her own act of kindness by donating the money to a children's hospice. 

Last week, another random act of kindness hit the spotlight after a passenger on a train left a heart-warming letter and £5 note to a young mother after being moved by her parenting skills.

Ken Saunders, 50, said he felt compelled to write the message praising single mother Samantha Welch as a ‘credit to her generation’, after watching her look after her three-year-old son Rylan.
