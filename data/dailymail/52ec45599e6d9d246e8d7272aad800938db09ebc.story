The man accused of killing one-punch victim Raynor Manalad will be the first person dealt with under new laws which could see him jailed for a minimum of eight years.

Hugh Garth, 21, stands accused of striking the 21-year-old nursing graduate while the pair were celebrating a birthday party early on Saturday morning. If convicted, Garth could face a minimum jail sentence of eight years.

He was today refused bail in a Sydney court where his charges were upgraded to assault causing death while intoxicated and causing grievous bodily harm. He will reappear in July.

'A beautiful sunset' Raynor Manalad was a recent university graduate with his whole career ahead of him, before he was killed by a single punch to the face

Tragic: Raynor Manalad was at a house party celebrating a 21st birthday party when he was hit by a punch to the face shortly after midnight on Saturday

Police will allege that during an argument with his girlfriend at the house party in Rooty Hill, Garth king-hit Raynor Manalad in the head while the victim tried to quell the conflict.

He was transported to hospital, but died the following day.

Mr Manalad was a recent Australian Catholic University graduate with his whole life ahead of him.

His death is the third of its kind to claim a young life in Sydney since 18-year-old Thomas Kelly and Daniel Christie died on the streets of Kings Cross.

And like both of them, it appears Mr Manalad was yet another innocent victim.

Friends and family have called for justice on Facebook declaring his death is yet another senseless act of violence.

'RIP Ray brother. Didn't know you well enough but through everything I've seen and heard the past few days you were loved by all. Heart goes out to all the family and loved ones. Rest well bro,'Â  Jeremy Nool posted to Facebook.

Another friend, Alyssa, described him as 'a beautiful sunset.'

'Hearing about your passing hits me like a ton of bricks. I cannot believe that you are gone. It hurts that you are no longer alive because you where the person who would always keep the peace in the group.'

The mother of the man accused of the killing is still in shock, first made aware of her son's arrest when approached by Channel Nine on Monday.

'I was watching 60 minutes, on the news Saturday, and that's when my heart was pumping,' she said.

She also said the severity of the situation was 'hard' for her to deal with.

Since the deaths of Thomas Kelly and Daniel Christie, both 18, and a number of other serious assaults on Sydney's streets, new laws have been introduced to help curb alcohol-fueled attacks.

The New South Wales government also introduced earlier lock-out and closing times for some of Sydney's busiest bars.

Mr Christie was walking along the same street as Thomas when he was attacked by 25-year-old Shaun McNeil on New Year's Eve.

Mr Christie had been in a critical condition for 11 days before his family made the decision to turn off his life support.

In December last year, Michael McEwen, 23, was attacked by up to three men at Bondi when he was punched to the ground and allegedly stomped on.

All these incidences were the catalyst for new mandatory minimum sentencing laws imposed against people who commit such crimes.

It was announced that anyone convicted of reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding a member of the public or a police officer while intoxicated can expect a minimum sentence of three to five years and a maximum penalty of up to 16 years.

Former premier Barry O'Farrell said the new laws, which included a curfew on trading hours to 3am across the city, sent out 'the possible strongest message' that drug and alcohol-fuelled violence will no longer be tolerated.
