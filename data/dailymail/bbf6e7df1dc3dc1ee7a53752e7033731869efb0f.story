Matthew Fludgate, 36, has been struck off by the National College for Teaching

A teacher who slept with his teenage pupil after the school prom has been banned from the classroom for life.

Matthew Fludgate, 36, who taught at St Edmund Campion School, in Erdington, Birmingham, had sex with the 18-year-old in a hotel room after the party in May 2010.

The former head of PE at the Catholic school was also accused of sending flirtatious text messages to another pupil, signed off with a series of kisses.

In June 2011, Fludgate was found not guilty of charges of rape, sexual assault and another serious sexual offence by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court.

But he has now been found guilty of ‘unacceptable professional conduct’ by the National College for Teaching (NCT), resulting in a lifelong ban from working as a teacher in any school, sixth form or college.

A spokesman for the NCT said: 'The panel has found that Mr Fludgate has been responsible for having sexual intercourse with a pupil, which, like the panel, I consider to be serious sexual misconduct.

'Mr Fludgate has not shown insight into his actions.

'In my view therefore this is a case in which a review period would not be appropriate and as such I have decided that it would be proportionate in all the circumstances for the prohibition order to be without provision for a review period.'

Speaking after the crown court verdict, Floodgate said the abuse allegations had destroyed his life. The court had been told that he had met with students at a Walkabout bar after the prom, despite the school telling teachers they were not to go out with students after the party.

The former teacher said the allegations of rape and sexual assault destroyed his life but he was acquitted of all charges at a trial in Birmingham Crown Court in 2011

The prosecution in the 2011 case, who told the court Fludgate had recently ended a relationship with a fellow teacher, claimed he later took an 18-year-old pupil, who was drunk, to a room he had booked earlier, in Birmingham's Broad Street Premier Inn, and forced her to have sex.

But Fludgate said the teenager had come to the hotel after she had told him she had nowhere to stay that night and that they had consensual sex.

He was dismissed from the school for gross misconduct following a disciplinary hearing held in March 2012.
