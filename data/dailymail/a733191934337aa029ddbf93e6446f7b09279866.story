The new mother recently had a Twitter rant about how 'huge' her hips and bottom are, and claimed to be starting a 'no carb diet' to shed the pounds.

And now, it has been revealed that the reality TV star's newfound insecurity may well have been sparked by two famous supermodels.

Is this picture to blame? Kim Kardashian was reportedly left feeling 'huge' standing next to Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell at Riccardo Tisci's birthday party in Ibiza and is now on a gruelling liquid diet 

A source told Heat magazine that 33-year-old Kim felt insecure standing next to Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell at Riccardo Tisci's star-studded birthday party last week in Ibiza.

'Kim was mortified by how huge she looked next to the models. She's been raging about it, saying she felt obese and short beside these women who are half as wide, but a foot taller,' said the source. 

'In the pictures, you can see she was trying to hide behind them and Kanye.' 

The source also revealed that Kim is on an 'extreme liquid diet' to get back to her pre-baby body and her trainer, Joey Gonzalez from Barry's Bootcamp, said that she's been coming in 'quite regularly lately'.

Barry's Bootcamp is a work-out class favoured by every A-lister from Jessica Alba to Victoria Beckham and is famed for helping attendees burn 1,000 calories per session.

Working hard: A source revealed to Heat magazine that Kim is on an 'extreme liquid diet' to get back to her pre-baby body and her trainer, Joey Gonzalez from Barry's Bootcamp, said that she's been coming in to his classes 'quite regularly lately'

Trying hard: Kim famously lost 50lb after giving birth to North in June 2013. She told her Twitter followers at the time she was on the Atkin's Diet and often she was seen at a Sherman Oaks, California gym

Kim has made no secret of her desire to shift the pounds. The star - who in a July episode of her E! show said she weighed 125 pounds - embarked on a frustrated Twitter rant about her weight gain, vowing to shed some pounds by cutting out carbs and doing 'crazy workouts.'

'Do any of u moms see their bodies just not the same? A different shape?' the 33-year-old reality star wrote in one of her posts. 'Ughhhh my hips & butt are huge now! they were big to begin with!'

The mother of North West, aged one, started the Twitter discussion with: 'Off to an intense workout. Can't seem to shake this last 15-20 lbs of baby weight. no more excuses. my baby is 1 years old! UGH.' That post was made at 7:41 am.

Six minutes later the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star added, 'I'm not gonna call it baby weight bc thats an excuse. i just gained weight & that's it. why is it so much harder to lose after baby though!!' 

Sharing her struggles: Just months after North was born, the then-blonde star showed the world that she had dropped a substantial amount of weight

The E! favorite then added seven minutes later, 'Just need to get down to my weight a few years ago. Not gonna complain anymore. Starting diet TODAY! No carbs. crazy workouts. Whos with me?'

The wife of Kanye West did not take a break.

Three minutes later she added, 'I think after having a baby u get so excited u lost a lot of weight then u get comfortable & eat how you used & it creeps back up.'

Seconds later she wrote, 'Ok no more tweeting and procrastinating! LOL Glad some of u moms can relate. I'm reading the comments! For real....of to the gym!'

One minute later she tweeted yet again, 'Wish me luck on the dieting...its soooo hard for me!' 

She seems frustrated: The E! star made four tweets in 10 minutes about her struggle with staying slim

Kim famously lost 50lb after giving birth to North in June 2013. She told her Twitter followers at the time she was on the Atkin's Diet and often she was seen at a Sherman Oaks, California gym. 

The star has long shared her weight struggles with the world.

When gaining weight with baby North she confessed on her E! show that all she wanted to do was hide. Comparisons to Shamu the whale were especially hurtful, she confessed.

Once she got her waistline back in the fall, Kim stripped down to a white bathing suit for a memorable selfie that showed off her round bottom but toned legs.
