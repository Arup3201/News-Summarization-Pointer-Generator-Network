A former Miami University student has escaped criminal charges after he distributed a flier on how to get away with raping female students.

The case drew national outrage in October after the shocking notice titled 'Top Ten Ways to Get Away With Rape' was found in a freshman co-ed dorm bathroom at the Ohio college.

The flier told readers that 'practice makes perfect. The more you rape, the better you get at it.' It also said: 'If you're afraid that the girl will identify you, slit her throat.'

The student pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, but a Butler County judge sealed records in the case, keeping the student's name secret, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer.

After The Enquirer challenged the judge's move to seal records in the case, the student was allowed to withdraw his plea and Prosecutor Michael Gmoser asked to drop the charges.

Judge Rob Lyons said sealing the case was something he routinely does for students.

According to The Enquirer, Lyons of Butler County Area I Court in Oxford allowed the student to withdraw his plea in a hearing on December 13.

Butler County prosecutors then decided against pursuing the case, and Lyons said he dismissed the charge.

The judge then sealed the criminal case a second time at the request of the student's defense attorney, Dennis Deters, to correct a mistake he made in November.

That mistake was among several violations The Enquirer alleged in its challenge to sealing the case. 

The Enquirer asked the Ohio Supreme Court to order Lyons to rescind his sealing order and open the file. The case is pending.

The newspaper sued after the student initially pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct.

It also claimed that Lyons could not issue a blanket order sealing every document in the case, that he didn’t hold a required hearing the first time around, and that he failed to consider any less-restrictive means of limiting public access to the records, which is required by the Ohio Supreme Court.

'Safety for all and fair justice for suspects are among our most important expectations of government,' Enquirer Editor and Vice President Carolyn Washburn said.

'In this case – a situation in which someone encouraged the heinous crime of rape – all of the handling of the only suspect happened in secret, including a decision to no longer prosecute.

'That does not make the community feel safe. And it does not allow the community to watch our elected judges and prosecutors to ensure justice was appropriately handled.'

Lyons wouldn't say whether he or prosecutors came up with the idea to hold the second hearing.An assistant for Gmoser is representing Lyons in the Enquirer suit.

Lyons said the charge against the student was 'insignificant' though he described the behavior behind it as 'offensive.'

Sealing the case the first time around was routine, he said.

'If you went to any college town, the number of sealings is very high because we have such a high degree of students that get convictions,' he told the newspaper.

'You've got kids with indiscretions that want their records sealed before they start applying for graduate school or go to the job market. Literally every week I have a stack of sealing entries.'

According to The Enquirer, Lyons' private law firm advertises that it can help seal criminal records.Lyons has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to dismiss The Enquirer's suit.

Deters and Gmoser declined to talk to The Enquirer about the case for the story.

The Enquirer's lawyer Jack Greiner said that the student was prosecuted as an adult and should therefore be identified.

'It goes to the heart of the public's right to know. The public is denied the right to observe the proceeding,' Greiner said.

'The judge's after-the-fact effort to rewrite history by allowing this individual to withdraw his guilty plea for no reason other than to allow the judge to cover up his initial illegal sealing order is appalling. It is why people become cynical about the system,' he added.
