England produced an error-strewn display which promised so much but ultimately delivered less than it should have done as Stuart Lancaster’s men developed a severe case of white-line fever.

The 12 point win means Lancaster’s side have an excellent chance of claiming an unlikely Championship title if they can see off France more convincingly than Ireland beat Scotland or Wales beat Italy.

But they will be kicking themselves at an incredibly wasteful display which saw no fewer than six gilt-edged try-scoring opportunities wasted as passes went astray and support runners were ignored.

England did score three tries to Scotland’s one, leaving their points difference four points to the good over nearest title rivals Ireland, but they could so easily have been out of sight if they’d kept their composure with the line at their mercy.

Jonathan Joseph, George Ford and Jack Nowell all crossed for Lancaster’s men, with Nowell’s late score adding some gloss to the scoreline. But Lancaster and his men will know this should have been so much more convincing.

The Calcutta Cup may be theirs, but this was far from the dominant, clinical performance England craved after the no-show in Dublin a fortnight ago.

Rarely can a side have dominated an opening 20 minutes of international rugby so completely but to so little effect. Time after time Scotland’s defence was torn to ribbons only for the England player in possession to run clumsily into contact, seemingly without any awareness of support runners or the need to shift the point of attack.

Luther Burrell started the pattern after just two minutes when he completely ignored Anthony Watson on his right to blunder head down into Scotland full back Stuart Hogg, who pulled off the first of three fine tackles. In truth, England should have scored with something to spare.

With five minutes on the clock, and Scotland seemingly on the ropes already, England piled into Scotland territory again and fly half George Ford whipped a cleverly delayed pass to Jonathan Joseph and the Bath centre hot-stepped his way over.

Ford added the extras to make it 7-0 and it looked for all the world as if England were set to take the visitors for a cricket score. After three slow starts in succession, finally Lancaster’s men had the momentum early in the game. No excuses now.

But, despite their dominance and superior attacking edge, England were simply unable to convert chances.

Mike Brown, making a welcome return from the concussion he suffered against Italy a month ago, latched on to a smart break down the short side from Ben Youngs after sharp work from Jack Nowell.

The England full back pinned his ears back from 20 metres but Hogg had his measure on an arcing run and again the chance was lost as the ball was turned over.

Nowell – who looked sharp throughout – was at fault next when he made a powerful break through the middle of Scotland’s defence only to ignore support runners on both sides and slip ineffectively into Hogg’s grasp. It was another chance lost and England could hardly believe they were just seven points ahead after a first quarter that promised so much but ultimately delivered little.

If England have serious pretentions to challenge the world’s top sides on a consistent basis they simply cannot afford to waste chances like this.

As Scotland sensed they’d somehow weathered the early storm, centre Mark Bennett forced his way over the line after 23 minutes on his side’s first serious incursion into England’s 22. Greig Laidlaw kicked the conversion and somehow Scotland were level at 7-7.

As the half wore on, Scotland’s confidence grew. Joe Marler was penalised twice for boring in with England’s scrum dominant while Dylan Hartley’s line-out radar was once again out of kilter. It came as no surprise when the England hooker was substituted early in the second half.

Ford and Laidlaw exchanged penalties before Brown was forced into emergency defensive action when Scotland wing Dougie Fife cut through England’s defence and look to be bound for a try. But Brown took him down, only for another penalty to be conceded, with Laidlaw kicked, as Scotland took a three-point lead in at half time.

England again started the second-half brightly and Ford went over within two minutes of the re-start when Chris Robshaw passed behind England’s first line of attackers and the fly half scurried in behind the Scotland defence. Referee Romain Poite chose not to refer his decision to the video referee despite suggestions of crossing.

Another penalty from the excellent Ford saw Lancaster’s men into a 20-13 lead on 51 minutes but old habits die hard and Tom Youngs, on for the ineffective Hartley, became the latest England latest player to qualify as a master butcher when he scythed through Scotland’s defence only to throw yet another pass to nowhere. England’s profligacy was astonishing to witness, for all the wrong reasons.

Brown looked to have scored on 62 minutes but – you guessed it – James Haskell’s pass was rightly deemed forward and England had their second try chalked off for a forward pass. Watson had crossed in the first half only for Ford’s earlier pass to Burrell to be called forward. Nowell dotted down late on to make it three tries to one.
