Alan Pardew will reward the Newcastle players who saved his job by allowing them to go on a Christmas jaunt to Amsterdam.

The Magpies boss has given his squad the green light to hit the Dutch capital following their fine run of form.

United – who traditionally enjoy a fancy-dress bash every December – will be led on their European getaway by the Dutch quartet of Tim Krul, Daryl Janmaat, Siem de Jong and Vurnon Anita.

Indeed, De Jong only signed for Newcastle from Ajax during the summer after leading them to the Eredivise title, while Anita joined from the Amsterdam club two years ago.

Newcastle will head off on their festive party after taking on current league leaders Chelsea at St James’ Park a week on Saturday.

Twelve months ago they celebrated Christmas following a 1-0 win at Manchester United with the likes of Krul dressed as a gangster, Steven Taylor as The Joker and Sammy Ameobi a Teenage Mutant Hero Turtle.

Pardew’s players have thus far avoided any scrapes during their yearly jolly and the manager will be hoping they are again on their best behaviour ahead of a busy December.

Following the visit of Chelsea they face Arsenal, Spurs – in the League Cup quarter-final – and Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby.

Newcastle are up to fifth in the Premier League following their fifth straight league win - against QPR on Saturday. Five weeks ago they were in the bottom three and Pardew’s position was under intense scrutiny.

But the 53-year-old has been thrilled with the response of his players, insisting he always had faith in the squad.

‘As a manager when you’re on the training ground you see and think, “this could be something”,’ he said. Then you have a run of disappointments even though we played quite well. Then you start questioning your own eyes and management experience.

‘But we felt there was something here. Suddenly we have hit the ground, got a win and just built on that. The spirit in the group is just fantastic.

‘From where we were, the run we’ve been on is very difficult to achieve. But that is down to the belief we have here, among the players and the staff.’

Jack Colback has appeared in every minute of United’s six wins on the spin in all competitions and the former Sunderland midfielder – a free-transfer arrival in the summer – believes his new club should be populating the top eight.

‘Momentum is how football works,’ he said. ‘We were not fantastic against QPR, but with the spirit around the place we always believe that at the very least we are not going to get beaten.

‘That is a massive thing and we maybe didn't have it at the start of the season. Everyone is pulling in the right direction and knows their role.

‘There have been a lot of players come in because of injury and they have all done fantastically well. Everyone is playing well. We are getting our rewards for that now.

‘That is great and it is nice to give something back for the fans. This is a big club with big expectations and we should be up there challenging within the top eight.’
