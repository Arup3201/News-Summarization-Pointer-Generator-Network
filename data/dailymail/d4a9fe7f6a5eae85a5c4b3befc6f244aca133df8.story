The Chateau Laroze 2007 has been flying off the shelves of the German supermarket chain

It is not the first place you would think to go for fine wine – but budget store Lidl says it has been overwhelmed with demand for a £19.99 claret.

The supermarket, perhaps  better known for discount lager than classy Bordeaux, is stocking a reputable St Emilion Grand Cru as part of a push for affluent  shoppers trying to bag a bargain.

The Château Laroze 2007 is the most expensive wine ever sold by the German-owned chain.

Lidl’s ‘Wine Cellar’ also includes a 2011 Châteauneuf du Pape at £12.49 and a 2011 Sancerre at £9.99.

The wines were chosen by a panel including Master of Wine Richard Bampfield, who gave the Château Laroze an ‘outstanding’ score of 90 out of 100.

The
current owners of Château Laroze, an obscure, St. Emilion classified 
growth, are the Meslin family, who can trace their roots back to the 
Gurchy family, who created the business in 1882, according to the Wine 
Cellar Insider website.

The 27 hectare Bordeaux vineyard of 
Chateau Laroze is planted with 68 per cent Merlot, 26 per cent Cabernet 
Franc and 6 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon.

In the Chateau Laroze blog, the owner describes the wine as having sex appeal.

Guy Meslin wrote in 2009: 'If any wine has sex-appeal, this one does. All the ingredients are melded and in place.

'The wood is nicely blended in and quite flattering, and nicely sets off the very fresh fruity hints.

'The tannins are not especially powerful, but contribute sheer silk and velvet.

'The finish prolongs all this with an emphasis on the aromatic freshness.'

The supermarket launched its wine range after realising customers were willing to spend money on the finer things

He said: 'This is a Grand Cru Classé 
which means it is at the top of the Bordeaux quality hierarchy and one 
has to expect to pay more for it.

'This is very fine, showing the 
fragrant aromas of St Emilion, a depth of flavour unusual for the 
vintage and a wonderful long finish, the hallmark of a great Bordeaux.'

Lidl is alone in selling the Château Laroze 2007 – it is only available from wholesalers otherwise.

Lidl increased its share of the groceries market by 10 per cent between October and January.

Aldi increased its share by 28 per cent and Iceland by 9.6 per cent over the same period.

Ben Hulme, Lidl wine manager, said: 
'Since the recession hit, we’ve seen a shift in customer spending habits
with many people, even those from more affluent backgrounds, finding 
smart ways to continue enjoying fine wines and good food at home. We 
want to offer people the opportunity to enjoy really good wines at 
prices that aren’t ridiculous.'
