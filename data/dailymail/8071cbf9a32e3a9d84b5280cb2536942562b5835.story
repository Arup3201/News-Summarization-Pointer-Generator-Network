Bagpuss must be the best loved pink-and-white cat in television history.

His enduring popularity is one of the reasons the little stop-motion animation series made by my father Oliver Postgate and his creative partner Peter Firmin is still being voted Britain's favourite children's TV series decades after it was first broadcast.

But he very nearly wasn't pink and white at all. Peter, whose idea it was to make a series about a magical cat whose thoughts could be seen, wanted Bagpuss to be marmalade and white but when the special fluffy fabric came back from the dyers something had gone wrong: the stripes weren't remotely orange, they were pink.

Peter, however, decided to go with the creative flow - something he and my father did a lot - and pressed ahead. And so it was that Bagpuss 'the most important, the most beautiful, the most magical... saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world' was born.

By the time Bagpuss was first broadcast in 1974, I was a sophisticated ten-year-old, so it didn't matter at all to me that the human star of the show was Emily Firmin, the youngest of Peter's six daughters and my regular friend and playmate.

Besides, I'd already had my own go in front of my father's camera, playing a guard in another of their TV shows, Pogles' Wood.

I'm now a cartoonist-turned-illustrator-turned-writer, and spend part of my time looking after Smallfilms, the company my father created in the 50s and through which he and Peter made such much-loved children's classics as Ivor The Engine, Noggin The Nog and The Clangers, as well as Bagpuss.

Bagpuss was shot in the big barn at Peter's farm - a dusty, mysterious but definitely magical place - using a camera that Dad had modified to shoot a single frame at a time using bits of Meccano.

That habit of making do and mending is very much at the heart of Bagpuss, with each of the 13 episodes beginning with a lost object that Emily had found and Dad's narration kicking off each story with the magical words...

'Bagpuss, dear Bagpuss,

'Old fat, furry cat-puss,

'Wake up and look at this thing that I bring.'

And with that Bagpuss would wake up, the picture turned from sepia to colour and the mice from the mouse-organ would get busily to work, cheerily cleaning up the lost object, while Bagpuss told a story, helped and hindered by Madeleine the rag-doll, Gabriel the banjo-playing toad and Professor Yaffle, the blustering and fearsomely intellectual wooden woodpecker.

Along the way, there'd be some sort of lovely folk-song too, beautifully sung by John Faulkner and Sandra Kerr, who respectively provided the voices for Gabriel and Madeleine.

Dad, who'd been to drama school as well as art college, had the most wonderful voice for telling stories, a voice that I've learned, since he died in 2008 aged 83, was woven into the childhoods of millions of children who grew up in the 60s and 70s.

For Bagpuss, he provided the voices of the narrator, Bagpuss and Professor Yaffle, the latter being secretly based on the great radical philosopher, Bertrand Russell, who my father knew as a child. Dad's own father, my grandfather, was Raymond Postgate, who somehow managed to combine being a highly regarded left-wing historian with setting up the annual restaurant guidebook The Good Food Guide, and Russell had been a regular visitor to their north London home.

Russell's high-minded, slightly halting delivery had clearly left its mark on Dad but the decision to give Yaffle similar vocal characteristics was an affectionate one for he and Dad shared many similar views, particularly when it came to pacifism and nuclear disarmament.

Some of these views he secretly passed on to Bagpuss, a fact he took great pleasure in revealing when the University of Kent presented Peter and him with honorary degrees at Canterbury Cathedral in 1987. They'd taken Bagpuss along as guest of honour, with Dad proudly announcing to the assembled throng that the pink-and-white cat was definitely 'a Miaow-ist'.

In 1999 Bagpuss was voted Best Children's TV Programme in a BBC poll, an accolade that delighted Dad and Peter and caused sales of merchandise - and particularly of pink-and-white cats - to go through the roof. Suddenly, after decades of just scraping by, they had some money.

Characteristically, they spent a big chunk of it paying for a new wing to be built for a Romanian children's hospice. Dad said it was what Bagpuss would have wanted.

Bagpuss may have been filmed in a converted Kent barn but, for its 40th anniversary, we've just had it digitally restored. All 13 episodes look absolutely wonderful - Dad would have been proud and I know Peter is because he still lives just down the road, as does Emily, who is now an artist.

Although Peter technically retired last year, at 85 he's busier than ever, and we're working on a new series of The Clangers. I'm writing the scripts and Peter is the design consultant, and he's already creating various bits and bobs.

 3 Months the original series ran for, from 12 February 1974 until 7 May 1974

13  The total number  of episodes made  - but they ended  up being shown on rotation for 26 weeks a year over the next 13 years

40m Pounds has been contributed to the UK economy so far by merchandise featuring the pink-and-white cat

15 minutes is the total length of each episode - and the first 2 minutes and  51 seconds of each is identical

We have no immediate plans to make new episodes of Bagpuss, although I'm regularly asked about it. I'm very wary; it's so idiosyncratic, so very much Dad and Peter's creation. But I haven't totally rejected a proposal from an American company.

An American company? I can hear shrieks of horror from Bagpuss's millions of loyal British fans. But Americans do understand Bagpuss - make do and mend is a big thing in the States and I can see an old clapboard shop somewhere on the coast of Maine with a large pink-and-white cat presiding, a little sleepily, over all sorts of gently paced, slightly wistful fun.

He'd still be baggy and just a bit loose at the seams but the important thing is that Emily would still love him. Because it wouldn't be Bagpuss if she didn't.

Happy Birthday Bagpuss, a book of projects to make, is out now from Collins & Brown, Â£11.99.
