These incredible photographs show a daredevil tackling an ascent even the hardiest of climber would baulk at - an ice cavern

Tim Emmett, 32, delved into the 130ft deep cave, which have walls towering to 33ft high.

He was joined by photographer Jonathan Griffith, 30, for their trip to the Mer de Glace glacier, in Chamonix, France.

Mr Emmett is a rock and ice climber, base jumper, wingsuit flyer, surfer, skier, snowboarder, inspirational speaker and stuntman who travels the world undertaking extreme challenges.

Fearless: Mr Emmett hangs suspended under the ice during his perilous climb. It is the latest in a long line of perilous adventures he has undertaken

Mr Griffith, who lives in Charmonix, said: 
'It's pretty chilly and quite surreal. The ice is incredibly clear and 
looks like it has been polished because it's so smooth.

'There is no sun - just a very cold mass of trapped air. It makes a change to normal ice climbing.'

He added: 'It was pretty noisy because there is a subglacial river that terminates there.'

The Mer de Glace is a glacier located on the northern slopes of the Mont Blanc massif, in the Alps. At seven kilometres long and 200 metres deep, it is the longest glacier in France.

Lat year Mr Emmett tackled a notorious ice route behind a Canadian waterfall. The ascent has a wall of ice hanging 45-degrees over a rock face.

Along with climber Will Gadd, he spent two weeks meticulously plotting their ascent of the Helmcken Falls in Canada - ominously dubbed the world's hardest climb.

The photographer who captured the images said: 
'It's pretty chilly and quite surreal. The ice is incredibly clear and 
looks like it has been polished because it's so smooth'

They had to battle deadly ice spray - which could freeze them to death in minutes - temperatures as low as minus 25C and the knowledge that one mistake would send them plunging into a 100ft deep ice hole below.

Mr Griffith was one of the climbers who said he feared he would be killed after he was attacked by Sherpas on Everest in April.

He said his group were punched, kicked and had stones thrown at them by up to 150 Sherpas in an extraordinary confrontation as they headed towards the summit of the worldâ€™s highest mountain.

The Nepalese Sherpas accused them of kicking ice down on them and breaking mountain etiquette by stepping over their ropes.

Stark beauty: Although it look serene, the cave is incredibly loud because a of the roar of a sub-glacial river that terminates there

At seven kilometres long and 200 metres deep, the Mer de Glaceis the longest glacier in France
