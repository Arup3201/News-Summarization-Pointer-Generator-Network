'Today it was tough because the semi-finals you have to approach with caution so I ran from the front and controlled the race,' Rudisha told BBC Sport. 'I feel my body is responding well and I'm feeling better which is pleasing. 

'I am expecting another good race in the final, there are some really tough guys in there.' 

Berwick runner Learmonth, 22, told BBC Sport it was a dream come true to grab a spot in Thursday's final.

'My whole aim was to get to the final,' he said. 'My legs were dying but I'm in the Commonwealth final and that's what matters. The Hampden roar pulled me over the line - I can't explain the energy and the buzz it gives you.'
