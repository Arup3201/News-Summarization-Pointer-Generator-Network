Incessant rain in Bristol washed out England's first Royal London Series match against India on Monday.

Alex Hales' one-day international debut will therefore have to wait until Wednesday in Cardiff, after a miserable forecast proved unerringly accurate.

England captain Alastair Cook confirmed on the eve of the first of five fixtures that Hales is to be his new opening partner, with Ian Bell dropping down to number three.

But he never even got close to officially announcing his team as rain set in two hours before the scheduled 10.30am start at Nevil Road and was still falling at 1.30pm.

At that point, umpires Paul Reiffel and Rob Bailey decided there was no prospect of even a minimum 20-overs-per-side match taking place.

Hales' ODI debut can therefore be pencilled in for the SWALEC Stadium this week, as England try to identify a formula for success against India and beyond - with next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand already very much in mind.
