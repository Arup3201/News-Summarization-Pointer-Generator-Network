England's abject defeat by New Zealand in Wellington ranks as one of their darkest days not only at a World Cup but in the country's entire history of playing the international game.

While England have not been expected to mount a serious challenge for the World Cup, nobody can defend a performance of such ineptitude, following so soon after last week's limp surrender to the tournament's other co-hosts, Australia.  

These are the shocking stats which prove just how low the team coached by Peter Moores and led on the field by Eoin Morgan have slumped.

226 - balls remaining when New Zealand wrapped up their stunning eight-wicket victory.

77 - runs scored by New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum during his onslaught.

308.00 - McCullum's strike rate. He scored his 77 off just 25 balls, including eight fours and seven sixes.

105 - runs scored by New Zealand during their first seven overs; England scored 36 in the same time.

20 - overs it took England to surpass McCullum's individual total.

6 - England batsmen dismissed in single figures: Ian Bell, James Taylor, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad and Steven Finn. James Anderson was left stranded on one not out.

9 - boundaries hit by England in their entire innings, which lasted 33.2 overs; McCullum hit 15 on his own.

4.25 - economy rate PER BALL of Steven Finn - the equivalent of being hit for a boundary every delivery.

49 - runs conceded by Finn in just two overs. He was hit for three fours and six sixes.

13 - extras scored in England's innings, which is more than their entire last six batsmen's totals combined.

7 - wickets taken by New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. 

2 - wickets taken by all four of England's bowlers. Both fell to Chris Woakes. 

5.61 - run rate of England's most economical bowler (or least expensive) so far in the tournament - Woakes.

19 - runs scored by Eoin Morgan in his last eight games, including four ducks in his last six innings.

56 - days between Alastair Cook's sacking as England captain and the start of the World Cup.

293 - runs scored by Kevin Pietersen, who was sacked by England despite top-scoring in last winter's Ashes whitewash - in this year's Big Bash. Only one batsman scored more.
