There will be a time when Vincent Kompany looks back on his career at Manchester City and reflects on some towering performances.

At the Etihad on Sunday, with the formidable presence of Chelsea striker Diego Costa keeping him on his toes in a bruising and compelling clash, this will rank among them.

Kompany lives for days like this, captaining his team into battle and emerging with the upper hand against one of the most prolific forwards in world football. 

Vincent Kompany put in another towering performance for Manchester City against Chelsea on Sunday

The Belgian captain and Diego Costa were involved in a titanic battle... which Kompany got the better of

Costa was kept quiet by Kompany, stopping him scoring his eighth Premier League goal

Costa had scored seven in his opening four games in the Barclays Premier League since his move from Atletico Madrid. It was Kompany’s job to stop him scoring the eighth.

The only thing missing was a win but, in the circumstances — down to 10 men after the dismissal of Pablo Zabaleta — one point will suffice. If Kompany had been on the winning team, no one would have begrudged him.

This was a colossal performance, restricting the leading scorer in the Barclays Premier League to just two shots. One hit the post, when Chelsea were leading 1-0, but that was the biggest scare.

Kompany’s timing was exceptional. He was immaculate, hooking the ball off Willian, Eden Hazard or Costa and then striding forward into areas usually occupied by Yaya Toure or Fernandinho. 

Eliaquim Mangala was also impressive for City on his debut in England

Between Kompany and Mangala, making his debut for City, they roughed up Costa, trying to provoke the striker. Someone, someday will make him blow a gasket.

City’s captain was ready for him in a clash that had threatened to boil over from the moment Fernandinho was shown the first yellow card.

That was 11 minutes in, with Fernandinho cautioned by Mike Dean for a reckless challenge that set the tone. In all, seven players were booked, including Costa. Chelsea’s forward was subdued, well short of the threat he provided in the opening four games against Burnley, Leicester, Everton and Swansea. Here at the Etihad he came up against two who have marked some of the best forwards in the world.

No disrespect to the central defensive partnerships of Jason Shackell and Michael Duff (Burnley), Wes Morgan and Liam Moore (Leicester), Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin (Everton) plus Ashley Williams and Jordi Amat (Swansea), but this was a tougher test and he struggled to impose himself after his manager, Jose Mourinho, revealed in the week that the striker is struggling with a hamstring injury. 

Costa was in sublime form before Sunday, netting seven goals against weak defences

A couple of years ago, when Kompany was in his pomp, he turned in what is rightly regarded as the finest performance he has ever given in a City shirt.

Against the champions, Kompany kept Manchester United’s forward line quiet at one end and scored with a header at the other to set up a 1-0 win. Two games later City were crowned champions.

That is the target for this team, for Kompany to guide them through this tricky period and make a fist of it at the top of the table.

They haven’t won since August 25, when the champions blew Liverpool away at the Etihad and all was well with the world. That seems a long time ago for City, but at least Kompany can still prove a point.

Kompany is approaching his form from 2012, when he lead City to their first Premier League title
