There has been a lot of talk, as ever, about Wayne Rooney in a World Cup year but the words of two former Manchester United midfielders spoke volumes last summer.

When Rooney's long-term credentials for both England and Manchester United were questioned, Roy Keane simply said: ‘If you think Wayne Rooney’s gone, then you are sadly mistaken.'

Paul Scholes, after wondering aloud whether Rooney's glory days were behind him, then gazed into his crystal ball: 'I don't think Wayne will be able to play centre forward until he's 34 or 35. But he could play centre midfield, possibly, into his mid-thirties.

Wayne Rooney strikes to score his second goal in Boxing Day's fixture against Newcastle at Old Trafford

In his new role Rooney has been likened to former Manchester United central midfielder Paul Scholes

In United's last three games Rooney has now been directly involved in five of their seven goals, scoring three.

'He's got all the ability to take over my old position at Manchester United.'

Now, under Louis Van Gaal, Scholes' premonition is coming into fruition. He has started the last three games as a central midfielder and has been directly involved in five of United's seven goals, scoring three.

Rooney is still United's most important player, still the soul and spirit of his team. He has now been dining at the top table of English football for some 14 years but he still seems to work harder, cover more ground and expend more energy than those around him.

If truth be told, not everybody at Old Trafford felt entirely comfortable with the prospect of Rooney wearing the captain's armband. Some felt he was granted preferential treatment by David Moyes and privately licked their lips with glee after the appointment of Louis van Gaal, presuming the Dutchman would favour Robin van Persie. Never presume.

Rooney's ability was questioned during the World Cup last summer, but appears to be enjoying his new role

Rooney is now well accustomed to the questions that surround his longevity as an elite footballer. And he continues to embarass those who ask them.

For some, Rooney is still not quite the player we wanted him to be. Nobody stirs the debate quite like him. He could drop a crisp packet on the floor and be blamed for climate change. The perception of Rooney veers from one extreme to another with unreasonable frequency. We lament his failure to reach the Ronaldo/Messi stratosphere when we should recognise his consistent excellence for club and country.

It is now nine Premier League goals for the season and he remains the one player that appears most eminently capable of lifting this United team when he feels the need.

Just like Paul Scholes, Rooney's Premier League record for Manchester United is phenomenally impressive 

As a captain, Rooney continues to mature. Privately, he was disappointed that he let his team-mates down with a wild hack on Stewart Downing in October, bringing a red card and a three match ban. That one instance, however, must be considered in the context of a player that has received only three yellow cards in his last 41 appearances for club and country.

His contribution to the United cause is unquestionable. Rooney has now scored or assisted 97 goals in his last 101 Premier League games at Old Trafford, scoring 68 and creating 29. It is a remarkable statistic and almost makes you question whether Rooney's considerable qualities have been underestimated in recent times. If his future is to lie in central midfield, it will bring a long over-due goal threat. A decade has passed since United last possessed a central midfield player that scored more than 10 goals in a single Premier League season. It was Scholes, in the 2004-05 campaign.

Rooney's passing accuracy against Newcastle on Friday was reminiscent of former Reds midfielder Scholes

Against Newcastle on Boxing Day, Rooney showcased the technique and vision that Van Gaal so clearly appreciates, recording a 90.2 per cent passing accuracy but even more impressive is the 85.7 per cent success in his opponents' half, underlining the damage he can do in the final third with that majestic chipped pass to create Robin van Persie's goal. It was a ball that Scholes would have been proud to play.

This was Rooney at his lung-busting, committed best but allaying all that dedication with his technical poise. For a long time, many have asked whether his endurance would be impaired by his powerful physique.

Van Gaal provided an emphatic answer to that after yesterday's performance: 'He has the lung capacity to run 90 minutes as a midfielder.'

To quote Keane once more: ‘If you think Wayne Rooney’s gone, then you are sadly mistaken.'
