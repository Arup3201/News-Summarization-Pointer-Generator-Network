It is the airline that is famed for hitting passengers with a huge fee if they forget to print their own boarding pass. But now Ryanair is going high-tech.

The budget airline has launched an app that will allow passengers to store their boarding pass on their phone and avoid having to print it out at all.

Ryanair has long talked about its wish to
 get rid of check-in desks altogether and to that end has charged 
passengers who go to the airport without their boarding pass already 
printed.

Charm offensive: The new technology is part of Ryanair's attempts to improve its service, along with allocated seating and increased cabin baggage allowance

Now, passengers can download their boarding pass on to their phone and show the digital version at check-in, rather than printing out a paper copy.

The boarding passes will be available offline and more than one can be carried on a single phone.

The app, which was officially launched
 today but has been available since Friday, is currently being offered in 
English, Italian and Spanish and the company said further language versions
 would follow.

It also 
allows passengers to view live flight information, make flight 
bookings, choose their seats, and add baggage to their booking.

Passengers must check in online up to one week - but no less than four hours - before their flight.

The only snag? You have to be in possession of a smartphone. If not, you will have to print your boarding pass at home or face a €15 (£12) fee at the airport.

And, if your phone runs out of battery before you reach the airport, you will still have to pay the €15 fee to have your boarding pass printed out at check-in.

Plus, 10 per cent of airports that Ryanair flies to do not offer mobile check-in services. The company said that these airports would be listed on its website.

The new app means passengers with smartphones no longer have to print their boarding pass - but they have to make sure their phone doesn't run out of battery before they reach the airport

Ryanair’s chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs, said: ‘We’ve worked hard to develop a product which we’re proud of and which will make travelling with Ryanair even better and our customers can expect regular app updates that will make it an even more useful travel tool.

‘Our ‘Always Getting Better’ programme has delivered better services, more choice and enhanced inflight and digital experiences for our customers and we look forward to making further improvements for the 84m people who will fly with us this year.’

The latest technology is part of Ryanair’s attempts to improve its image after issuing its first profit warning in over a decade last year.

It introduced allocated seating, increased its cabin baggage allowance and cut the fee for printing a boarding pass, which used to cost €60 (£48).

Not foolproof: Anyone whose phone dies before they reach the airport will have to pay a 15 euro (£12) fee to print their boarding pass at the airport

Last month, in a desperate attempt to appeal to family travellers, Ryanair announced its new family product, Ryanair Family Extra, offering families a range of discounts on travel and an improved service on all flights.

With the new plans, families are offered fifty per cent allocated seating discounts on children’s seats, fifty per cent off checked-in bags for children and discounted priority boarding.

They also announced fifty per cent off travel insurance for children, reduced infant fees (now £20), a free 5kg infant bag allowance.

Appealing to their passengers travelling with very young children, Ryanair bosses announced that there will now be bottle warming and baby changing facilities on board every plane (something most parents expect).

Families will also be allowed two free pieces of infant equipment, such as buggies, booster seats, car seats or travel cots in the hold.

As an extra added bonus, regular fliers will get a Fly & Save bonus – giving them twenty per cent off their third family flight when their family fly twice.

Change of heart? In 2012, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary called a passenger who was charged £236 to print five boarding passes 'stupid' and an 'idiot'

In 2012, the airline’s chief executive Michael O’Leary called a passenger who forgot to print her boarding pass an ‘idiot’. He claimed that 99.98 per cent of Ryanair passengers printed their boarding pass in advance and said: ‘To those who don’t, who say quite politely: ‘B***** off'.'

Passenger Suzy McLeod was charged €300 (£236) to print out five boarding passes before a flight from Alicante to Bristol.

The Ryanair boss branded her 'stupid' and an 'idiot' for failing to comply with the agreement at the time of booking.

Mrs McLeod, 35, from Newbury, Berkshire, criticised Ryanair’s rule and said she was unable to print her family’s passes while they were in Spain for 15 days last month. Passengers could not print out boarding passes more than 14 days in advance.

She was backed by more than 350,000 Facebook users after complaining of her ‘unfair’ treatment by the Irish no-frills airline, which has been frequently criticised for its extra charges.

But Mr O’Leary said she should have printed the passes at an internet cafe or asked a friend to print and fax them to her.

Instead, he said, ‘she then comes home and gets on Twitter, God help us all, and somehow we are going to change our policies. No, we’re not’.
