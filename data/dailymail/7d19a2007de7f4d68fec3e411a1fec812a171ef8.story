Britain would commit ‘economic suicide’ if it left the European Union, Nick Clegg warned today as he issued a rallying cry to voters, companies, charities and even the policy to defeat eurosceptics.

The Deputy Prime Minister pleaded with pro-Europeans to speak out in favour of the EU before it is too late and Britain finds it has ‘stumbled out’ of Brussels.

He urged people drop pro-EU views into conversation and flood Twitter and Facebook with messages, arguing ‘anyone and everyone who can see that there is strength in numbers in today’s world’.

Rallying cry: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged pro-Europeans to speak out

Warning: Mr Clegg used a speech at the Buhler Sortex factory to concede that a referendum on Europe was now inevitable

David Cameron has promised to renegotiate links with Brussels and put it to a public vote by the end of 2017 if he is in power after the next election.

In a major speech today, Mr Clegg claimed the Prime Minister’s timetable was ‘chosen for internal party management’ and says it would be better for a referendum to be in response to the next change to EU rules.

However, he now accepted a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was inevitable.

Mr Clegg has written to more than 100 organisations, including business and trade groups and charities, pleading with them to speak out in support of the EU.

Timing: The Lib Dem leader said it would be better for a referendum to be in response to the next change to EU rules

I am writing to you ahead of a speech I will be giving tomorrow arguing the case for Britain’s continued membership of the European Union.

Every day British businesses, families, charities and organisations of all kinds benefit from Britain being in the EU - whether through trade, jobs or our influence in tackling the big global issues that matter. Yet as the debate on this issue intensifies, the pro-European case is increasingly being drowned out. 

I want to use my speech as a rallying cry to ask people like you, who believe that Britain is stronger in than out, to speak up about what we gain from the EU and what we risk losing  if we leave.

This is not a party political issue. I am not urging you to support the Liberal Democrats.

Yes, Europe needs reform. But we need to lead from the front and work at that from within Europe. If we want Europe to deliver for Britain we need to stay in the room and win the argument.

If you believe the European Union offers the best future for Britain – join in the debate. Let people know how much this matters to your work.

You can also tweet to let people know why you think we are better off IN at #whyiamIN.

Together let’s stand up for a proud Britain leading in a better EU.

Best wishes

Nick Clegg

Speaking in Docklands, East London, Mr Clegg said: ‘I am not asking you to get involved in the party politics. I’m not asking you to support the Lib Dems.

‘But I am asking you to be part of a coalition for the national interest – standing up for Britain remaining in Europe; for a Britain that is richer, safer, greener and stronger in the world.’

He said every company that buys or sells ‘across the channel’, groups representing business interests, big banks and small family firms all had an interest in staying in the EU.

He said he was also calling on ‘the hundreds and thousands of Brits who’ve relocated to France, Spain, Greece’ to speak out.

In a surprise move he also called on ‘the police;  the charities who pick up the pieces when men, women and children are trafficked across our borders; the human rights organisations that want to make sure British citizens stay signed up to the protections in EU law…

‘The green groups who want a UK that can lead the way on climate change; the farmers and fisherman who need a level playing field in Europe; the millions of British consumers who get better, cheaper products because we’re a member of the EU; and anyone and everyone who can see that there is strength in numbers in today’s world.’

He urged them all to tweet using the hashtag #whyIamIN, post messages on Facebook and personal websites, write to the Government, write to the newspapers and drop it in to conversations with family and friends.

Mr Clegg said Mr Cameron’s strategy for a renegotiation of the relationship with Brussels was doomed because it would not be accepted by his party.

Characterising the plan, with its 2017 deadline, as a political fix to end internal Tory divisions in the run-up to the 2015 general election, Mr Clegg said the Prime Minister was ‘playing with fire’ and ‘it is Britain that will get burned’.

He added: ‘I don't think it's very complicated to imagine circumstances in which you could reform here, have a little smidgen of repatriation there, a treaty wording change there.

‘That's not really the issue. The issue is I don't believe that will ever meet the test which is actually being set by the vast part of the Conservative Party, which is that they don't just want another treaty change with a bit of reform, they want a complete semi-detachment or indeed total exit of the European Union.

‘That's why I think the whole strategy is flawed, because it is raising expectations, certainly among the ranks of the Conservative party, which will not be met by that process.’

Taking sides: Mr Clegg called for a 'fundamental and visceral debate about what side are you on in this basic divide'

Mr Clegg believes next year's European elections will be fought as a proxy for the choice between remaining in or leaving the 28-member block.

Most European elections have been a ‘mid-term plebiscite on the performance of the government of the day’ but this contest would be more ‘fundamental’.

He said: ‘Now is the time to have a much more fundamental and visceral debate about what side are you on in this basic divide - are you basically for leading the reform of the European Union by being committed to it, or are you half out the door, or do you advocate exit altogether.’

Mr Clegg said among the reforms he would like to see would be an end to the ‘bonkers’ situation where the European Parliament alternates between Brussels and Strasbourg.

‘Some of its working practices, not least its second seat in Strasbourg, are totally bonkers and should be changed,’ he said.

However, Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Eurosceptic campaign group Business for Britain, said: 'Nick Clegg has shown today that he is out of touch with how the majority of the British people, including thousands of British business people, feel about the European Union.

'If he thinks that the EU Parliament alternating between Brussels and Strasbourg is the only 'bonkers' aspect that needs changing, he should go and speak to the bosses at companies across Britain, drowning in a sea of absurd EU directives and regulations.'

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady praised Mr Clegg for highlighting some of the workplace rights that are enshrined in EU law.

'His views are in stark contrast with the Prime Minister who wants to offer the dismal choice between leaving the EU or staying in a Europe stripped of rights at work,' she added.
