Google has apologised after its mapping service renamed a road in Berlin after Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

The intersection, usually called Theodor-Heuss-Platz, temporarily regained its Nazi-era name - Adolf-Hitler-Platz.

The area carried Hitler's name after he came to power in 1933 until the end of the Second World War.

Previously, it was known as Reichskanzlerplatz and in 1963 it was renamed after Theodor Heuss - the country's first president.

Local media reported the mistake remained on Google Maps for a couple of hours.

Google spokeswoman Lena Wagner said Friday the company quickly took down the name after the error was discovered.

Google says it's not clear how the error occurred, but that 'we apologize for this mistake.'

Scores of streets and squares were named after Hitler during his 1933-1945 dictatorship.

The intersection in question, in western Berlin, sits on what the Nazis envisioned as the capital's main east-west axis for a redesign of the city that was never completed.
