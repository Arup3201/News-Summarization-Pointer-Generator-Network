Tiger Woods shrugged off any doubts over his fitness by warning that he is back to his best just days before the start of The Open.

The former world No 1, who had surgery in March to cure a back injury, said: ‘This is how it used to feel.

'I had been playing with the injury and had my good weeks and bad weeks. Now they are all good.’

VIDEO Don't give up on Tiger - Watson  

Woods won The Open the last time it was played at Royal Liverpool in 2006 - two months after the death of his father, Earl.

He said memories were flooding back on Saturday after he warmed up by playing the first five and last four holes before the rain fell.

After weeks of rehab, Woods insisted he is ready to win the famous Claret Jug at Hoylake for the second time. ‘I am only going to get stronger. As the weeks go on I am getting stronger and faster. It goes to show you my rehab worked.

‘I was at a point where I could not get out of bed. That was tough to deal with. But not now.’
