Millions of holidaymakers crossing the English Channel face long delays under ‘unworkable’ new immigration laws, travel chiefs warned yesterday.

Home Secretary Theresa May wants ferry and rail firms to carry out stringent exit checks to improve border security and identify illegal immigrants.

Staff at firms including Eurostar, Eurotunnel and P&O face taking on the role of border guards by scanning all passports and checking that photographs match the passengers before they board.

Stringent checks: Theresa May is urging ferry and rail ports to step up security and passport checks

They say it could take tourists up to six times as long to check in, putting them at risk of missing their trains or boats.

The travel industry says the  rules – some of which were only made law last week – may even be illegal under European Union free movement laws.

The Government is committed to introducing 100 per cent exit checks by April 2015, but critics claim it is to make the Coalition look tough on immigration.

It follows the collapse of a £500 million scheme called  e-Borders that was meant to put details of all passengers on a database before they travel.

Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe claimed the new rules had been ‘poorly thought out’.

Guy Platten of the UK Chamber of Shipping called for ‘a regime that intercepts illegals without obstructing everyone else’.

Maritime industry leaders will meet Mrs May tomorrow. The Home Office said: ‘We are working closely with carriers and rail, maritime and air port operators.’
