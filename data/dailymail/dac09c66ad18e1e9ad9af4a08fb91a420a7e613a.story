The New York City cab driver who killed a five-year-old girl and a 25-year-old man after mounting a curb and crashing through a bus stop on Friday has been stripped of his taxi license, it is reported.

The unidentified male driver, 44, was traveling along the snowy Grand Concourse service road near 170th Street in the Bronx on Friday evening when he swerved on to the sidewalk, police said. 

His green taxi struck and killed Kadeem Brown and little Tierre Clark, who were part of a group of people waiting at a bus stop.  Tierre's mother, 39, and a 55-year-old man were also hit by the cab.

The grief-stricken mother, who has two older children and has not been named, is said to be in a stable condition at the borough's Lincoln Hospital, while the man is being treated for critical injuries.

Earlier impact: Seconds before the incident, the driver had struck a Subaru (pictured), which was parked around 100 feet south of 170th Street, causing minor injuries to the woman driving it, police said Saturday

Now, it has emerged that the driver - who was transported to Jacobi Medical Center with minor injuries following the crash - has had his Taxi and Limousine Commission license taken away by officials.

This is while 'police investigate if he was having a medical episode when he crashed' his 2007 Toyota Camry green cab into the four unsuspecting victims, authorities told the New York Daily News.

It comes as Kadeem and Tierre's families have paid tribute to their deceased loved ones following the horror smash, which occurred at the bustling Grand Concourse at around 6.30pm on Friday.

Speaking to the newspaper, Kadeem's mother, Macia Johnson, 53, described her late son as a 'very good, hardworking kid' who worked as a security guard, but longed to travel and be a chef. 

She also revealed that Kadeem's sister had wailed, 'He went out and he never came back, my brother, my poor brother!,' when she heard he had died on the sidewalk after being struck by the cab.

Meanwhile, Tierre's grandmother, Liz Romani, paid tribute to her granddaughter, who  had 'loved to sing and dance' and had a particular fondness for the singer-songwriter, Mary Jane Blige.

Shocked: Witnesses reported hearing loud screams as the vehicle crashed through the bus stop in the Bronx. Ronald Luis (pictured), who saw the tragedy occur at around 6.30pm, said: 'I heard a lot of people screaming'

Speaking through tears, 58-year-old Ms Romani told the newspaper: '[Tierre] would just be walking down the street and break into song, she loved whatever popular music was out.'

She added that the snowy, icy conditions were no excuse for the cab driver's deadly actions.

Seconds before Friday's crash, the driver had struck a Subaru, which was parked around 100 feet south of 170th Street, causing minor injuries to the woman driving it, police told CBS New York.

Despite the impact, he reportedly continued driving another 100 feet or so, before jumping a curb and crashing into the group waiting at the bus stop. He finally smashed into the wall of a building. 

Witnesses reported hearing loud screams as the tragedy unfolded.

Passerby Ronald Luis said: 'I heard a lot of people screaming, so that’s what really caught my attention. And when I looked back, that’s when I saw the car drive onto the sidewalk.'

Speaking to ABC 7, the 18-year-old added: 'It was frantic, very scary, never seen anything like it.'

Emergency crews arrived at the bustling Grand Concourse, where they discovered Mr Brown and Miss Clark lying unresponsive on the ground. Mr Brown, who lived nearby, was pronounced dead.

Stuck: It remains unclear how the crash happened. Above, the cab is pictured on the sidewalk in Mount Eden

Witnesses watched in shock as medics desperately tried to revive the youngster by carrying out CPR on her small body and rushing her to hospital. But despite their best efforts, she shortly died.

'On this side they were pressing on her chest - the little girl. I’m guessing also she couldn’t breathe. I wasn’t sure,' witness Raymond Fermin told CBS, describing Mr Brown as 'already gone'.

'[Mr Brown] was lying on the sidewalk in front of the green taxi,' 18-year-old Mr Fermin continued. 'He was face-down, dead. They weren’t even treating him. They just put a white sheet over him.' 

It remains unclear  how the crash happened. The cab's front was left completely smashed in. Police and the Taxi and Limousine Commission are investigating, the New York Daily News reported
