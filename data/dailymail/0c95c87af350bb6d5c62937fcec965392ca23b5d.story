Three star athletes at a rural Georgia high school have turned themselves in over allegations they took part in the brutal sexual assault of a fellow female student at their senior prom.

Fields Chapman, Andrew Haynes and Avery Johnson also all 18-years-old, are accused of sexually assaulting the teen girl May 10 at a raging alcohol-fueled party held at a rented log cabin just outside Calhoun, where all four reside.

Gilmer County authorities said the trio inserted a foreign object ‘causing tearing and severe trauma’ into their victim while other students watched but did nothing to stop the attack. It has also been revealed that no parents were present for the party.

The quarterback: Fields Chapman faces multiple counts related to the sexual assault, 28 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and was revealed to have been on probation the night of the alleged attack

The unidentified victim claimed to police the next day that she passed out in an upstairs bathroom and claimed she had been raped after blacking out, sources told WSB.

She reported the sexual assault from a hospital bed where she was being treated for her injuries, but admitted she could not remember her attackers names or faces.

About two dozen high schools and other young adults were at the party, according to the station. Many of them brought beer and liquor to the cabin.

Chapman, Haynes and Johnson each faces counts of aggravated sexual battery, sexual assault and sodomy for the attack, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Chapman also faces 28 separate counts of sexual exploitation of a minor after police found more than two-dozen sexually explicit photos of an underage girl performing various sex acts at the party, sources told the paper.

All three were indicted Monday by a grand jury.

The baseball player: Avery Johnson faces the same charges as Haynes, all three were barred from their graduation ceremony

The girl in the pictures is not believed to be the one sexually assaulted that night, District Attorney Alison Sosebee told the AJC.

The teens, who graduated last month, do not face charges of rape because investigators have been unable to prove they actually had sexual intercourse with their victim, according to WRCB.

Haynes and Chapman had each been arrested several months prior to the May incident for underage drinking, and Chapman was on probation at the time of the alleged assault, the AJC reported.

More than 50 witnesses have been interviewed during the investigation, authorities said, and the local sheriff plans to charge anyone found to have been consuming alcohol despite being under the age of 21, he previously announced.

‘Alcohol and teenagers just do not go together,’ an official said at a previous press conference.The allegations led to all three of the accused to be barred from attending their graduation ceremony despite having graduated, according to reports.

Chapman played quarterback for the Calhoun High School football team. Haynes was a tight end and Johnson was a pitcher and third baseman for the baseball team.

The students were well known athletes and appear to have popular among their peers.

Reactions to the allegations ranged from shock to disappointment.

‘A party is a party, but that’s just ridiculous what happened after it,’ student Jessie Kincaid told WSB. ‘That’s taking it too far,’ said another.

‘One thing about having fun, but there’s another about breaking the law,’ said a third student.

A parent called the situation ‘a shame,’ in comments to the station.

All three of the suspects have bonded out of jail and await their next court date.
