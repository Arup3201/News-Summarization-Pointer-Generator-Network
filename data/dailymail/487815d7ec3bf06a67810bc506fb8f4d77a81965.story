Rio Ferdinand will not replace Clint Hill as QPR captain when he joins the Loftus Road club.

Ferdinand is finalising his move to west London and is expected to sign soon.

The former Manchester United and England captain is close to agreeing a one-year deal with QPR after leaving Old Trafford at the end of last season.

The move will see him reunited with Harry Redknapp, for whom he first signed as a schoolboy when he joined West Ham 21 years ago.

And Redknapp said: ‘It’s a terrific deal. Rio will be a great player for us with his knowledge and his experience of the game.’

But despite his experience at the top of the game, Redknapp will not make him captain. It is understood Clint Hill will have that honour.
