If you've got a question about anything to do with London and the Olympics, you might want to think twice before asking Boris Johnson after looking at these pictures...

The capital's mayor appeared completely bamboozled when he took charge of an information kiosk  in Spitalfields, east London, this afternoon.

Posing for photographs at the window of the brand new information 'pod', setup to help Olympic visitors with information, bumbling Boris picked up a pamphlet about the area.

Bamboozled: With air of bewildered puzzlement etched across his face, he leafed through the pocket-sized tourist advice brochure from behind the desk

But, after some mumbling and head-scratching, the city's Dear Mayor appeared to finally make sense of what he was reading, regained his composure and got back into character as London's favourite tour guide.

An onlooker said: 'It was classic Boris. He didn't seem to know what was going on. But he made a joke of it. Perhaps it was all part of his act.'

Young ambassadors will be stationed at 43 pods across the capital to provide a welcoming face of London during the Olympics.

Meanwhile no more than a javelin throw away, two luxury cruise liners glided into nearby Royal Albert Dock and moored to provide accommodation for thousands of Olympic workers.

The Braemar and the Gemini, which are stationed close to the ExCeL Centre Olympic venue and have a combined capacity of 2,000, will host bus drivers and security staff.

According to owner Fred Olsen Cruise Lines's website, the Braemar's public rooms feature 'polished wood, gleaming brass 
fittings, subtle lighting and attractive fabrics'.

It adds: '[The ship's] cascading 
decks at the stern provide plenty of spaces for sun-bathing, while the 
vessel also has two open-air swimming pools with a poolside bar and twin
jacuzzis.'

Its sister ship, The Gemini has a number of bars, a swimming pool, jacuzzi and even a spa and gymnasium.
