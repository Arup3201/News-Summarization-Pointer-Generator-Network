A banned driver who was chased by police when they spotted him driving recorded a 'selfie video' at the wheel documenting the high speed pursuit.

Salim Shah raced through the streets of Burnley pursued by police and recorded the last 33 seconds of the chase on his mobile phone. 

The 23-year-old, who is recorded saying goodbye to a female friend, says into the camera: 'As you can see, I am being chased by police..'

He added: 'I love you. I'm going to prison now. Will probably be out in about six months or something.'

Stills from the video selfie recorded by Shah show him behind the wheel and with the blue lights of police cars apparently behind him as he records the final 33 seconds of the high speed police chase, lasting 17 minutes

The chase through Burnley lasted 17 minutes and started after police spotted him on the Eastbound M65 near Burnley at about 9.45pm.

Pursuit-trained officers tried to stop it on Blackburn Road, Accrington, but Shah carried on and the chase ensured, with police using their emergency lights and sirens.

The car stopped with the front seat passenger getting out and the person in the back seat falling out of the car and close to the back wheels. 

The chase then continued, with Shah racing through 30mph at up to 60mph, driving through three sets of red traffic lights and Give Way junctions. 

He almost hit other vehicles and then went down a small, narrow alleyway at speed, making very sharp turns on blind bends. Police had to slow to 10mph to make these bends. 

Shah then dumped the car and tried to run off but was found hiding in nearby undergrowth. He then said to officers: 'It was a good chase, wasn't it.' 

Shah, who had been banned from driving, recorded the 33 second video as he sped through Burnley 

Shah was given a suspended sentence for disqualified driving, just two months before.

At a hearing at Burnley Crown Court he admitted dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, no insurance and possessing cannabis. 

Shah, who has previous convictions for banned driving, taking a car without consent and driving without due card and attention, was disqualified for two-and-half years and must take an extended retest.

Salim Shah recorded the video during a police chase

He was sentenced to 16 months behind bars.  

Kimberley Obrusik, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant's mobile phone had been used during this incident to make a 33 second video. The phone was held in a cradle on the dashboard and the defendant's face can be seen clearly within it, still driving. It was the final 33 seconds of the chase.'

Shah later told police he had borrowed the car from a friend and his actions had been a spur of the moment thing. 

He claimed his driving was careless rather than dangerous as the roads were 'quite quiet.' 

The court heard in July, he was given 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 18 months and banned for 18 months, after being convicted of driving while disqualified and failing to stop after an accident.

Laura Barbour told the court that Shah had been given bad news on the day of the incident, September 16. 

He had been on his way to see the woman involved. Miss Barbour said the offences showed 'an enormous amount of immaturity'. 

She added: 'He has had the opportunity to do a little growing up. He has now spent nearly six weeks in custody and he has found that a very difficult experience. It has sharpened his mind.'

Shah claimed he smoked cannabis to self-medicate as he suffered from arthritis. 

Shah, who had created a detailed business plan in custody, intended to start a small business when he was out of prison.  

Shah was spotted by police driving on the M65 Eastbound near Burnley when he had been banned previously

Shah was sentenced to 16 months in prison at a hearing at Burnley Crown Court where he admitted dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualfied, without insurance and possessing cannabis which was found in the car

He had a job offer as an assistant manager of a company which supplied fresh produce.

Miss Recorder Suzanne Goddard, QC, said Shah knew perfectly well what he was doing. 

She added: ' It was a quite deliberate course of driving. The word stupid runs immediately to mind.'
