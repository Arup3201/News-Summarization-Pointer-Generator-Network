Campaigning MP Simon Danczuk and his selfie-loving wife Karen have been spotted dining together on a 'date night' - but the couple seemed more interested in checking their phones than in engaging in conversation.

The Danczuks both had their handsets out as they waited for their dinner to arrive at an Indian restaurant in Victoria, not far from the House of Commons in central London.

Mrs Danczuk is known for sharing a vast number of revealing selfies on her Twitter account, chronicling every aspect of her life for her online fans.

Engrossed: The couple appeared to be more interested in their screens than in each other

But her husband has been less successful in his social media usage - last work, it emerged that he had accidentally favourited hard-core porn using his iPhone.

The Rochdale MP blamed the gaffe on a faulty phone charger, but freely admitted that he has watched porn in the past because he is a 'man of the world'.

Mr and Mrs Danczuk dined at Paradise, an Indian and Pakistani restaurant where main courses cost around Â£8, on Friday night.

They sat in the window as they both used their phones, before Mrs Danczuk jokingly tried to apply lipstick on her husband's face.

Affection: The couple were seen kissing as they enjoyed dinner at the Paradise restaurant in Victoria

Mrs Danczuk did not appear to share any selfies from her evening out, even though she is usually keen to let followers know what she is up to.

The Rochdale councillor frequently posts photographs of herself after exercise sessions, trying on new clothes and attending events.

Mr Danczuk, who is seeking re-election to his seat in the upcoming general election, was embarrassed last week when a 'technological accident' led him to click on a pornographic tweet with his iPhone.

But yesterday, he insisted that the mistake was not a big deal, saying: 'Let's be truthful about this. If I am being asked have I ever used porn, then the answer is yes.

Notorious: Karen Danczuk frequently takes revealing selfies which she shares with fans on Twitter

'I am a man of the world. I wouldn't deny that sort of thing. I think we should not be too sanctimonious about this.'

His wife joked on Twitter: 'Anyone seriously offended by a bit of porn favouriting?? Come on, if you're not watching it yourself you really need to. It's healthy.'

Mr Danczuk has a reputation as a maverick voice within the Labour party, and caused a stir last week when he suggested that Ed Miliband was seen as being more out-of-touch than David Cameron.
