A Canadian engineer has defied gravity in a human-powered helicopter to scoop a long-standing international aeronautical prize.

The team from the University of Toronto has made aviation history to win the long standing AHS Sikorsky Prize with a flight lasting 64 seconds and reaching an altitude of 3.3 metres.

Todd Reichert, 31, provided the pedal power for the crazy aircraft to make the first ever sustained flight of a human-powered helicopter.

A team from the University of Toronto has won the long standing AHS Sikorsky Prize with a flight lasting 64 seconds and reaching an altitude of 3.3 metres. Todd Reichert (pictured) provided the pedal power for the crazy aircraft to make the first ever sustained flight of a human-powered helicopter

The AHS Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition began in 1980 to find the first successful human-powered helicopter that can fly over three metres in height while hovering for at least one minute in an area of ten square metres.

The $250,000 prize has not been awarded since the competition began and creative engineers have been competing for the title for over three decades - with very few coming close to winning.

AeroVelo, a team made up of past and present students from the University of Toronto, competed with a team from Maryland University in a bid to take the coveted prize.

The team's helicopter, nicknamed Atlas, measures 47 metres across but weighs just 54 kilograms.

The super light-weight frame is made of carbon fibre tubes that connect the four rotors to the central bike, used to power the hand-made aircraft.

It relies on the pilot's physical strength to keep it airborne.

Mr Reichert said: 'As you spin your legs, you're spinning the rotors.

'It's very much an exercise in mental and physical control, at the same time as an all-out physical effort,' according to The Ottawa Citizen.

Despite the huge amount of physical exertion, he described hovering in the air as an 'incredible feeling'.

Mr Reichert said: 'This isn't something that you're going 
to commute to work in any time soon, but it's an exercise in really 
pushing the limits on what's physically possible, and what you can do 
with lightweight materials and really creative design.'

'Winning this competition really is a catalyst to keep doing the things we love.

'Our goal is to take on projects that really inspire people to follow big dreams'

The small Canadian team worked on the helicopter for more than a year and endured plenty of slow changes to perfect the prize-winning design as well as two crashes that wiped out their work each time.

The team's chief structural engineer, Cameron Robertson, said: 'I hope that this inspires not only our fellow Canadians, but also global citizens to do more with less.'

The team said: 'We came into this very confident that
we were capable of winning this prize.

'We realized that 
the prize was a lot more difficult than we originally anticipated, but 
at every step we were able to overcome the difficulty and get even 
closer and closer to the prize.'

Dozens of students at the university worked on the AeroVelo Atlas project.

Professor David Zingg of the university's engineering department, said: 'This
is a tremendous accomplishment.

'It 
is a great technological achievement, requiring ingenuity, knowledge, 
and experience in a number of challenging technical areas.

'Through 
accomplishing such a challenging feat, Todd and Cameron have provided 
tremendous inspiration for young engineers both in Canada and around the
world.'

Mr Reichert and Mr Robertson have set up a company called AeroVelo and plan on developing different human-powered vehicles.

They hope that human-powered vehicles will be seen as a viable alternative or supplement to those burning fossil fuels.

It is not the duo's first record-breaking win.

In 2010 they created a human-powered ornithopter called Snowbird - an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings - and made aviation history by achieving human-powered bird-like flight.

The Canadian team are the first to win the AHS Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition which began in 1980. The team including Mr Reichert (pictured) managed to fly over three metres in height while hovering for at least one minute in an area of ten square metres to scoop the $250,000 prize
