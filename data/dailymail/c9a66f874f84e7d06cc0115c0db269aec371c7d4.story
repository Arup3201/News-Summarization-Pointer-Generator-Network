The surge 
of thousands of unaccompanied children illegally crossing the border 
from Mexico is being fueled by misperceptions about U.S. immigration 
policy rather than growing violence in Central American, according to a 
leaked report.

The
 report was compiled by the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) last 
week. The organization focuses on the collection and distribution of 
tactical intelligence concerning the southwest border and is run jointly
 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection.

‘Of
 the 230 migrants interviewed, 219 cited the primary reason for 
migrating to the United States was the perception of U.S. immigration 
laws granting free passes or permisos to UAC (unaccompanied children) 
and adult females OTMs (other than Mexicans) traveling with minors,’ 
said the report, which was leaked to Breitbart Texas.

The surge of thousands of unaccompanied children illegally crossing the border from Mexico is being fueled by misperceptions about U.S. immigration policy rather than growing violence in Central American, according to a leaked EPIC report

Human
 smugglers - known as coyotes - are exploiting perceived changes to U.S.
 immigration law after the Obama administration decided in 2012 to 
practice prosecutorial discretion in cases where individuals were 
brought into the U.S. illegally as minors.

‘These
 cartels have seen a weakness in the system. They've seen statements 
coming from the administration that they have used in order to just 
frankly increase the number of people coming over,’ Rep. Mario 
Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., told reporters on Tuesday.

‘It's
 a critical situation and if we don't deal with it urgently but well- 
done right- then we're facing a crisis of just huge proportions,’ said 
Diaz-Balart, who recently visited Central America.

The
 intelligence assessment, meant only for law enforcement, also cited 
data from the United Nations office on Drugs and Crime Statistics saying
 despite an explosion in the number of illegal minors, crime data 
actually showed a dip in violence in Guatemala, El Salvador and most 
significantly Honduras.

Homeland Security projects that if current trends continue, as many as 90,000 illegal children will enter the U.S. by the end of this year and nearly double that,160,000, next year, according to a draft chart circulated on Capital Hill

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., has warned that drug cartels in Central America are exploiting a weakness in the U.S. immigration system

Homeland
 Security projects that if current trends continue, as many as 90,000 
illegal children will enter the U.S. by the end of this year and nearly 
double that,160,000, next year, according to a draft chart circulated on
 Capital Hill and obtained by Fox News.

Homeland
 Security officials have previously stressed that a combination of 
factors, including a bad economy and security concerns, are behind the 
unprecedented surge.

Earlier
 this month, the federal government launched a $1 million media campaign
 to try and combat the surge by urging Central American parents not to 
send their children to the U.S. as illegals.

The
 message aimed primarily at Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador is 
two-part: The trip to the United States is extremely dangerous, and 
immigrants who make it here will not be allowed to stay.

‘We
 have to stem the flow,’ said U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, who launched the campaign while standing 
beside the Rio Grande.

As
 part of the Dangers Awareness Campaign, a catchy Spanish song was 
commissioned to discourage families in Central America from sending 
their children with smugglers to cross the U.S. border through Mexico.

That
 song - La Bestia - has subsequently become a major radio hit in Central
 America, with its legion of fans unaware it was created to 'teach' them
 something.

La
 Bestia - translated as The Beast - refers to the notoriously dangerous 
freight train that migrants ride from Southern Mexico - risking robbery,
 kidnapping, rape, and murder - just to make it to the U.S. border.

The track features lyrics such as: 'Migrants from everywhere, entrenched along the rail ties.

'Far away from where they come, further away from where they go.

'They call her the Beast from the South, this wretched train of death.

'With the devil in the boiler, whistles, roars, twists and turns.'

The song is just one part of the Dangers Awareness Campaign which will employ hundreds of billboards
 and some 6,500 public service announcements for radio and television 
stations in the target countries.

The television and radio spots all finish with a similar parting message: 'They are our future. Protect them'

One
 offering has an image of a child's footprints in the desert running 
toward the horizon with the message in Spanish: ‘I thought it would be 
easy for my son to get papers in the USA. ... I was wrong.’

A television spot slated to air in Guatemala shows a teenage boy preparing to leave home for the U.S.

His
 mother pleads with him not to go. He confides to his uncle - already in
 the U.S. - in a letter that she's warning him about the dangers of the 
gangs on the train that immigrants ride through Mexico, the cartels that
 kidnap and the dayslong walk in the desert.

Ultimately, he writes his uncle, ‘he who doesn't take a chance, doesn't win.’

The
 next image is of the boy dead on the cracked desert floor. A voice-over
 says smugglers' claims that new arrivals will easily get papers are 
false.

The television and radio spots all finish with a similar parting message: ‘They are our future. Protect them.’

‘We
 want a relative that is about to send $5,000, $6,000 to a relative in 
El Salvador to see this message and say, “Oh my god, they're saying that
 the journey is more dangerous,'" said CBP spokesman Jaime Ruiz. ‘We try
 to counter the version of the smuggler.’

Ruiz
 said the campaign is scheduled to run for 11 weeks. He will be 
traveling to cities with large immigrant communities in the U.S. as well
 to reach the parents or relatives on this side of the border who may 
help fund a child's trip.

‘Families
 need to understand that the journey north has become much more 
treacherous and there are no “permisos” for those crossing the border 
illegally,’ said Kerlikowske. 

‘Children,
 especially, are easy prey for coyotes and transnational criminal 
organizations and they can be subjected to robbery, violence, sexual 
assault, sex trafficking or forced labor.’
