An NHS hospital was forced to pay £1,800 for a nurse to cover a Bank Holiday shift, a shock investigation has revealed.

Another trust paid an astonishing £2,500 to an agency for a locum doctor to work the same day. 

The statistics, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, come at a time when the NHS is under increasing financial pressure.

They reveal the extent to which short-staffed hospitals are relying on locums to get through public holidays. 

Many cost up to £150 an hour – as in the case of the nurse hired for £1,800.

In one hospital, half of the doctors who worked on May 5 were locums, according to the investigation by Sky News. 

Almost a third of the nursing staff at another trust were supplied by a private agency.

Experts warn that using locums who are not familiar with the hospitals they are working in can put patients at risk.

They are demanding a review of the rates of pay given to private agencies. 

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘These figures are truly shocking. Many (of the nurses) will never have been to that ward before and will probably never be there again.

‘It says nothing about continuity of care. Even finding your way around the ward, the geography, it makes life really difficult. 

'Agency nurses do not provide good value for money…and the employers who use these extraordinary levels should be held to account for it.’

Hospitals turn to external agency workers at critical times, such as when A&E use peaks over bank holidays and when staff are off sick. 

But critics say better organised trusts which have higher staffing levels per patient are less reliant on them.

The 48-hour working week restrictions introduced under European law in August 2009 also pushed up annual spending on locum doctors, especially in hospitals providing 24-hour acute care.

Dr Carter said hospitals were being ‘held over a barrel’ by locum agencies. ‘This is public money that is not being well spent,’ he added. ‘This is something that should be looked at with the utmost urgency.’

Eighty of the 150 NHS trusts in England contacted by Sky News supplied information on how many locums they employed and at what rates on May 5.

University Hospitals Bristol, which runs Bristol Royal Infirmary (pictured) paid £1,800 for a nurse on a shift of just over 12 hours, an investigation has revealed

At the Heart of England trust in the West Midlands, half of the doctors working that day were temporary, the figures show.

At Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals almost a third of nurses were from a private agency. 

There was a similar proportion of agency nurses at Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals in Berkshire.

The figures also show that hospitals are paying huge sums to cover key shifts. 

University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay paid an agency £2,500 for a locum doctor to work a single shift. 

Seven weeks later, it was rated as inadequate in an inspection by the Care Quality Commission and placed in special measures.

University Hospitals Bristol paid £1,800 for a nurse on a shift of just over 12 hours – the equivalent of almost £150 an hour – and just under £1,800 for a shift by a locum doctor. 

Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust paid almost as much – £1,798 – for a middle-grade nurse specialising in mental health. 

That is almost a month’s pay for the average nurse. The money is paid to the agencies, which keep some and then pass the rest to the nurses. 

Last month, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured, held talks with NHS bosses on how to fill a £2billion gap in its funding

The percentages they receive vary from case to case.

In January, the Daily Mail revealed some understaffed A&E units were paying GPs £1,500 a shift to work evenings and weekends. 

Separate figures published in April suggested that the NHS has spent £2billion on agency staff since 2010/11.

Last month, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt held talks with NHS bosses on how to fill a £2billion gap in its funding. 

Senior sources warned the ageing population, the cost of new drugs and the rising pensions bill for staff had left the Health Service in England with the shortfall for next year.

A Department of Health spokesman said yesterday: ‘We now have 6,700 more doctors and 6,200 more nurses directly employed by NHS organisations than in 2010. 

'The figures…are not a full picture of staffing in the NHS, but we encourage all trusts to maintain a tight grip on their staff costs and we will hold poor performers to account.’
