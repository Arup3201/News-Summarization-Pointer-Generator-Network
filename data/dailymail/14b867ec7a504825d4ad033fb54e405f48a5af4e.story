A 'thoroughly deceitful' benefit cheat
was jailed today after he was secretly filmed playing golf - despite 
claiming he could barely walk.

Robert Cave told the Department of 
Work and Pensions that a degenerative condition meant he struggled to 
carry out minor tasks such as lifting pans from the cooker to the sink.

But a court heard that in reality, the
50-year-old was enjoying rounds of golf two or three times a week at 
his £600 per year club, regularly taking part in competitions, and had 
got his handicap down to an impressive 15 - on a 3.8-mile golf course.

Cave first applied for disability benefit in 1996 he said walking was extremely painful and it took him two minutes to walk 10 yards.

He also claimed it took him 10-15 minutes to lever himself out of bed.

Cheat: Robert Cave has been warned by a judge that he faces jail after he was secretly filmed playing golf while claiming disability benefit

Energetic: Cave, 50, looks like he has the perfect swing as he goes to hit the golf ball. He had previously claimed that walking was extremely painful and it took him two minutes to walk 10 yards

Good shot: A court heard that Cave played golf two or three times a week, had a handicap of 15 and regularly played in competitions

In 2007 he reported he could not walk more than 50 metres without stopping and found it hard to lift pans from the cooker to the sink.

But following a tip-off, Department of Works and Pensions investigators began to monitor Cave.

That led to him being secretly filmed playing at the 18-hole Norwood Park golf course, Southwell, Nottinghamshire, in October, 2009.

A video played in court had showed him hitting balls on the driving range and on the third hole of the course, which is  3.8 miles in length. Ninety per cent of the time he used a buggy to get round the course.

Judge Andrew Hamilton, sentencing, said the case was one of the worst he had dealt with.

He added: 'He is thoroughly deceitful 
and dishonest man. You don’t get a golf handicap of 15 overnight. He 
must have been playing regularly over a long period of time to do that.

'I think this is a most flagrant 
breach. I can’t imagine a more flagrant breach. I can imagine the public
annoyance and fury at the disgraceful dishonesty of this man. It is 
utterly appalling.'

Cave, 50, earlier pleaded guilty at 
Nottingham Crown Court to failing to notify an improvement in his 
capabilities between April 2006 and January 2010.

During that time he pocketed £12,500 in disability living allowance.

Judge Hamilton also poured scorn on 
Cave’s claim that his condition was causing his elbows to crumble, 
adding: 'A golf club requires considerable use of an elbow, both of 
them.'

Cave was also filmed lifting garden fence panels outside his home in Mansfield and carrying flattened boxes to his car.

Judge Hamilton also poured scorn on 
Cave’s claim that his condition was causing his elbows to crumble, 
adding: 'A golf club requires considerable use of an elbow, both of 
them.'

And he hit out at the sentencing 
guidelines for the scale of offending in Cave’s case, describing them as
'horrendously low'. Judge Hamilton said the maximum sentence he would 
have bee able to impose was 26 weeks in jail, with a 10 percent 
reduction for a guilty plea.

John Hallissey, prosecuting, told the 
court that since making his original claim, the DWP asked Cave every 
year if there had been any change in circumstance that might affect his 
entitlement to benefits.

However, he failed to tell them that 
his condition had improved thanks to the use of physiotherapy and 
steroids. In 2007, he filled in a new claim form in which he said he 
could walk for no further than 10 yards.

The DWP launched a covert 
investigation into Cave two years later following the tip-off. In August
2009, he was seen at his home in Mansfield, Notts, lifting boxes and 
fence panels, and loading a golf trolley into his car boot.

Then, weeks later, he was secretly recorded at Norwood Park Golf Centre near Southwell, Notts.

Mr Hallissey said: 'He was filmed 
removing a golf cart from the boot of his car. He was filmed initially 
on the driving range practicising his swing and then on the third tee 
standing on one leg, bending over, and picking up his tee after making 
his shot.'

After his arrest Cave, a married father of two, admitted he played golf and competed regularly.

He pleaded guilty to failing to notify
the DWP to a change in his circumstances between April 2006 and January
2010. During that time he claimed £12.604.

Laura Pitman, defending, said there was medical evidence Cave’s condition had worsened, and he hadn’t played golf for two years.

She added that he now admitted he should have told the DWP that his illness had previously improved.

Speaking after the case Sian Fellowes,
a senior benefit fraud manager at the DWP, said: 'We will be looking at
recovering the money through seizure of his assets and that will 
include his house and any money he may have.'

A confiscation hearing will be held in May.

At the time of Cave’s guilty plea last
month, Welfare Reform Minister Lord Freud said: 'It’s cases like these 
that show us why welfare reform is needed.

'We have a duty to the taxpayer and our customers to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them.

'Benefit fraud takes money away from 
the most vulnerable. It is a crime and we are committed to stopping it 
by catching criminals at the front line and making sure our reforms make
the benefit system less open to abuse.
