At least four people were killed and dozens were wounded when a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb near a Syrian security compound.

The explosion happened in a predominantly Kurdish town, raising fears that the country's largest ethnic minority might be drawn into a widening civil war.

Opposition activists, who are fighting to remove the Syrian president Bashar Assad, claimed the death toll was at least eight.

The attack, which apparently targeted Syrian intelligence agents, occurred on Sunday in the remote north-eastern town of Qamishli, more than 435 miles from the capital Damascus.

Syria's more than 2million Kurds, long marginalised, have largely stayed out of the fighting, although some have participated in protests against Assad's regime.

But what began as an uprising 18 months ago has now spiralled into a full-blown bloody civil war.

The conflict has killed more than 30,000 people, activists say, and has devastated entire neighbourhoods in Syria's main cities, including Aleppo, the scene of intense fighting on Sunday.

The leaders of Turkey and Egypt, among Assad's main enemies, sent stern warnings to the regime and its allies, in speeches to Turkey's ruling party.

Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi said that 'we will be on the side of the Syrian people until the bloodshed ends, the cruel regime is gone and Syrian people reach their just rights'.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Syria's allies Russia, China and Iran to end their support for Assad, warning that 'history will not forgive those who stand together with cruel regimes'.

Turkey has given shelter to tens of thousands of Syrian refugees and rebel fighters have used the country as a crucial logistical centre since they captured key border territories during the summer.

Syrian troops left several towns and villages in the Kurdish north-east during the summer, possibly to divert forces to overstretched troops fighting in hotspots elsewhere.

However, the regime has maintained a security presence in Qamishli, which abuts the Turkish border, said Rami Abdul-Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's blast. Several previous suicide attacks in Syria were claimed by a Syrian militant group, the Al-Nusra Front.

Syrian state media said the explosion
went off in an area housing security officers. It said four people were
killed, dozens wounded and nearby buildings damaged.

An amateur video posted online by activists showed a column of white smoke rising between buildings in Qamishli.

The Observatory said eight Syrian intelligence agents were killed and at least 40 people wounded in the explosion.

Most Kurds live in the north-east, but Aleppo and Damascus also have Kurdish-dominated neighborhoods.

Last week, a Kurdish district in Syria's largest city, Aleppo, was for the first time drawn into fighting between rebels and regime forces, amid conflicting reports about whether Kurdish gunmen fought alongside the regime or remained on the sidelines.

Fighting continued on Sunday in several areas of Aleppo, as part of what rebels say is new push to drive out regime forces.

Opposition fighters seized several areas in an initial offensive two months ago, but were unable to keep up the momentum. On Thursday, they announced what they said would be a decisive battle. Either side could potentially shift the direction of an otherwise stalemated war if it seizes Aleppo, a city of 3million people.

Abdel Kader, a commander of the Tawhid Brigade, the largest rebel unit in Aleppo, said that his men were fighting in seven areas on Sunday.

Pro-Assad troops have been shelling rebel-held districts. Amateur video posted by activists on Sunday showed Syrian warplanes flying over the city and heavy smoke rising from the city's skyline.

Before the civil war, Aleppo was Syria's business centre.

Its walled old city with a medieval covered market, or souk, was recognised as a World Heritage site, one of six in Syria.

Late on Friday, the fighting sparked a huge fire in the market that continued to burn on Saturday, destroying hundreds of shops.
