Row: Karen Jackson, Chief Executive of Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust, has taken a 20% pay rise despite being placed in Special Measures

The chairman of a failing hospital trust due to be taken over by an NHS 'hit squad' said today it would have been a 'grave mistake and a false economy' not to boost the chief executive's salary by £25,000. 

Karen Jackson is in charge of Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals Foundation Trust, which was put in special measures last month after a major national review of high mortality rates.

Yet she received the inflation-busting rise from £145,000 to £170,000 in April last year.

That increase makes her paid £27,500 more than the Prime Minister, whose salary is £142,500.

Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced the trust, which serves a population of 358,000 people from three main sites in Grimsby, Goole and Scunthorpe, was one of 11 to be placed in special measures following the Keogh Review into high mortality rates.

The critical review found: a lack of clinical changes being made to improve care; ambulance staff were caring for patients in some cases at the A&E department at Grimsby Hospital; concerns over staffing levels and skills; and that the trust was breaching national standards on mixed sex wards.

But Andrew Allison, national grassroots co-ordinator of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the revelation 'adds insult to injury' following the findings of the  Keogh review.

'Mrs Jackson has been rewarded handsomely for failure - there is not other way to describe it.

'Despite her assurances that patient safety and quality of care is always her top priority, it appears pocketing masive pay rises has been at the top of her list.

'I can’t see how local residents can have any confidence in her,' he said.

Nevertheless, Mrs Jackson's pay increase was justified, the trust chairman felt.

A cash-strapped council has been blasted after all 44 councillors voted for a nine per cent pay rise - while workers will receive just a one per cent wage increase.

The controversial deal will see Stoke-on-Trent City Council leader Mohammed Pervez receive an extra £4,000 bringing his pay packet to £48,000.

Councillors’ pay will increase by £1,000 to £12,000, while cabinet members will enjoy a £2,000 rise to give them £24,000.

Members voted against immediately accepting the increase last year as council staff were subject to a pay freeze.

But the ruling Labour group agreed on the nine per cent rise at a private meeting this week because employees have since accepted their own one per cent rise.

Deputy Leader Paul Shotton, whose allowance will rise by £2,500 to £30,000, defending the decision.

The Labour councillor said: 'These rates are set by an independent panel. The councillors have not given that rise to themselves.'

Council worker James Withers, 45, said: 'It is disgusting that councillors are giving themselves such a bumper pay rise while the rest of us see our salaries pretty much stay the same'.

Dr James Whittingham said: 'The remuneration committee is responsible for agreeing the executive management team's salary bands and uses a national system to determine its decisions on pay.

'The bands are reviewed every year and a variety of factors are taken into account, such as comparative salaries in the NHS, individual performance and market forces.

'The executive salaries at this trust are either in line with or below those at similar trusts.

'It is important that we pay salaries which are commensurate with the job to attract and retain high calibre people.

'Karen Jackson's starting salary in 2010 was set below the agreed rate as it was her first chief executive post, and she declined a pay rise after her first year in the role.

'She is now receiving a salary that is roughly in line with the average for trusts of this size and type.

'The remuneration committee always strives to keep a balance between competitive pay and the need for financial restraint in what are challenging times and I fully believe we have achieved that.

'It would be a grave mistake and false economy to pay so far below the market rate that executives leave their posts or are impossible to recruit.'

Members of the remuneration committee whose salaries are being discussed by the committee do not participate in these discussions, the trust said.

The chief executive joined in autumn 2010 on a salary of £145,000, she declined a rise in 2011 and it was increased to £170,000 in April last year in line with similar roles, a trust spokeswoman said.
