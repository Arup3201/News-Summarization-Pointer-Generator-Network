Anxious: Tomos James, 11, has been refused a free bus pass even though police say it is unsafe for him to walk to school

A young boy faces a daily three-mile walk through drug dens after being refused a bus pass as he lives just 80 yards too close to his school.

Tomos James, 11, has been refused the free  pass even though police say it is unsafe for him to walk to school.

Instead, his daily trek will take him through a forest, drug dens, a waste-ground full of burned-out cars and areas classified as 'anti-social'.

His anxious mother Ruth, 41, is campaigning for education chiefs to give Tomos free transport when he starts at high school in September.

A confidential letter from police spelling out the dangers to council transport chiefs has been leaked by campaigners.

A senior officer said in the letter: 'I have advised Mrs James that this is not a safe route for her child to walk.

'This section is one in which we deal with a number of anti-social problems including cars being burnt out, drug misuse, motor cycle annoyance and assaults.

'During the winter months children would have to walk along the forest path in darkness at times when there are not many people around.'

Tomos, of Bonymaen, Swansea, lives too close to Bryntawe School to qualify for the school bus.

Swansea Council said children qualified for free transport if they live more than three miles along an available walking route to their school of choice.

But Tomos’s house is exactly 260ft inside the three-mile boundary.

His father Peter, 43, said: 'We are outside the area by about 80 yards but to get to school it means Tomos will have to walk through a forest.

'Another part of the route takes him through a very rough area where all the street lights have been smashed and there’s drug paraphernalia all around.

'It is dangerous - I’m scared he may get mugged for his mobile phone.

'The council thinks its alright for a boy of 11 to walk all that way through an unsafe area - I say it’s not acceptable.

Unsafe: Tomos's daily three mile trek will take him through a 
forest, drug dens, a waste-ground full of burned-out cars and areas 
classified as 'anti-social' by police who say it's not safe for him to walk alone

'They are not concerned about the children’s personal safety, just road safety, as long as they are not walking near traffic they don’t care.'

The James’s have four children with another one due in October.

A Swansea Council spokesman said: 'We understand the frustration of parents whose homes fall outside of the qualifying boundary for free transport to school.

Route: Tomos's route to school is three miles long and has been deemed 'unsafe' by police but the council say he still doesn't qualify for free home to school transport which has frustrated his parents

'Following the concerns raised by Tomos’ parents, council officers have been on site and carried out a full review of the walking route.

'The assessment is based on a child being accompanied as appropriate by an adult, not a lone child.

'As a result the route does meet the criteria as an available route which means Tomos does not qualify for free home to school transport.'
