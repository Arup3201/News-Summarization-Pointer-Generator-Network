BT Sport have chosen to broadcast the FA Cup quarter-final replay between Blackburn Rovers and Liverpool, leaving the BBC with Reading vs Bradford.

The BBC were criticised for not showing Bradford's 2-0 win over Sunderland in the fifth round, opting to show Aston Villa's 2-1 win over Leicester City instead.

Yet BT Sport's decision to broadcast the match at Ewood Park on April 8 means the Beeb are left with Reading and Bradford at the Madejski on March 16.

Bradford beat Chelsea 4-2 at Stamford Bridge in the fourth round but were shunned when they claimed another Barclays Premier League scalp against Sunderland in February.

The broadcaster's football editor Mark Cole released a statement afterwards explaining why Bradford were not shown on television, though their match against Reading in the quarter-final at Valley Parade was live on BT Sport.

The draw for the semi-finals was made following Manchester United's 2-1 loss against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Monday night. The match itself pulled in an audience of 8.9million which pips the previous season high of 7.1m people tuned in to Cambridge United's fourth round 0-0 draw against Louis van Gaal's side. 

Arsenal will face Bradford or Reading at Wembley, while Aston Villa will meet either Liverpool or Championship side Blackburn.
