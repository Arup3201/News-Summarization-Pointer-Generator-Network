Raunchy music videos similar to Miley Cyrus's famous Wrecking Ball and Britney Spears' B**** could be censored as officials clamp down on sexual content.

Addressing fears of the public, the British Board of Film Classification could now call for some music videos to be shown only after the watershed because of 'special worries' about the material being shown.

Only yesterday BBFC announced plans to change film classification so that children as young as 15 could watch feature films filled with obscenities.

Raunchy music videos, such as Miley Cyrus's Wrecking Ball, are set to be clamped down on in the UK

Another artist whose videos are likely to be affected by the crack down is Rihanna, seen here in Pour It Up

The vow to crack down on the videos came as the BBFC released a report stating that parents are losing control over what their children watch.

Citing the increasing use of tablets, phones and computers, the body warned that children are able to watch violence and pornography without their parents knowing.

As the Daily Mail highlights today, the body noted that swear words are now so ‘commonplace’ among teenagers that it made the decision to relax age ratings.

The British Board of Film Classification claims parents accept it is ‘game over’ when protecting their children from bad language.

Separately, it noted: ‘A specific 
issue highlighted by the consultation is in relation to sexual content, 
where the public is particularly concerned about the sexualisation of 
girls, and pornography.  

‘The content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn are special worries.’

It also said the ‘sexualisation of young girls was of particular concern’.

‘Music
 videos were identified as a key source of sexual imagery, which parents
 believed to be potentially harmful to young girls’ emotional wellbeing 
and social development,’ the report said.

‘The overwhelming reaction to the music videos content was one of shock and incredulity.’

Britney's Work B**** has been restricted in France on the grounds that it shows 'a sadomachistic universe representing women in a way that risks shocking many viewers'

Rihanna came in for criticism from her own fans for this music video, which she released in October

Last week, music videos featuring Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears were banned by France's broadcasting watchdog before 10pm.

The CSA said that Miley's Wrecking Ball and Britney's Work B**** must be shown when more 'adult' programming is on.

The ban will do little to deter the 
singers, however, as Miley's video became the most viewed on YouTube in 
24 hours when it was released in September last year, generating 
12.5 million hits. It currently has more than 475 million views.

Despite
 its popularity the clip drew concern from fellow songstress Sinead 
O'Connor after Miley said she was inspired by her 1990 Nothing Compares 2
 U video.

Veteran performer O'Connor penned an 
open letter to the younger singer, urging her 'don't let the music 
industry make a prostitute of you'.

She
 wrote: ‘I am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led
 you to believe, or encouraged you in your own belief, that it is in any
 way "cool" to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos.

'It
 is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing 
yourself to be pimped, whether it’s the music business or yourself doing
 the pimping.

‘Nothing but harm will come in the 
long run, from allowing yourself to be exploited, and it is absolutely 
NOT in ANY way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women, for 
you to send across the message that you are to be valued (even by you) 
more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent.’

Last week, Miley's Wrecking Ball video was banned in France before 10pm on television

Beyonce, seen here in her video for Partition, could also be affected by the proposed crack down

Britney's raunchy offering, which was released in October, has drawn more than 70 million viewers online.

Her video was also reportedly banned from UK music channels before 10pm at the time of release, with broadcasters asking for a clean edit to go along with the much-censored Work version of the song.

Meanwhile, in October Rihanna faced an extraordinary 
backlash after her own fans branded one of her videos 
‘obscene’, ‘vile’ and ‘pornographic’.

Hundreds
 took to social networking sites to tell the singer that she should be 
ashamed of herself over the X-rated images in Pour It Up.

They questioned whether she was fit to be a role model to her millions of young and impressionable fans.The BBFC spoke to more than 10,000 people from across the UK between December 2012 and throughout 2013 for the report.
