It has been credited with sharpening women's fashion sense and promoting the single lifestyle.

But the TV series Sex And The City has had another unexpected outcome - helping to rid the world of pubic lice.

There has been a huge decline in recent years in the number of cases of lice, with clinicians claiming that the rising popularity of Hollywood or Brazilian-style bikini waxes is the cause.

Doctors from the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) believe they can link the lice decrease with the airing of an episode of Sex and the City in 2000 which sparked the waxing trend.

Trend setter: Sex And The City, starring from left Cynthia Nixon, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Kim Cattrall, has been credited with sparking the waxing trend, resulting in a huge decline in the number of pubic lice cases

The episode shows several of the main characters - Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha - undergoing a wax where all the hair is removed.

The pubic louse has infested humans for 
thousands of years, with archaeologists discovering specimens in the UK 
as far back as the 1st century AD.

The pubic louse evolved from its 
ancestor, the gorilla louse, about 3.3 million years ago and adapted to 
live in areas on the human body with a similar density of hair to that 
of the gorilla.

Unfortunately this was a costly mistake, as a mere 3.3 
million years later the international success of ‘Sex and the City’ has 
led to an unprecedented removal of this very hair.

The increase of Brazilian or Hollywood waxing is believed to have caused a decrease in the cases of lice which are now on the threshold of going extinct

A UK study showed a fourfold increase in
its incidence, from 0.8 per cent in 1954 to 3.2 per cent in 1964, which may have been 
due to increased sexual freedom.

However, from 1997 to 2003 a further UK
study revealed a steep reduction in prevalence from about 0.41 per cent to 
0.17 per cent.

The research due to be presented at the British Association of Dermatologists’ Annual Conference next week.

Similar observations have also been reported from sexual health 
specialists in Australia.

Sydney's main sexual health clinic hasn't treated a woman with pubic lice since 2008 while male cases have fallen 80 per cent from about 100 a decade ago.

A decrease in sexual activity could not have 
accounted for this, as the prevalence of other sexually transmitted 
diseases has increased.

Dr Kun Sen Chen, one of the authors of 
the presentation, said: 'Pubic hair removal has been practised by humans
for thousands of years, by cultures from all over the world, including 
the Ancient Egyptians.

'However, until recently, with the rise of truly 
global mass media, pubic lice have been able to weather changing 
cultural attitudes to body hair.

'What we have seen at work is the law of
unintended consequences, in popularising hair removal Carrie Bradshaw 
and co have contributed to ridding humanity of pest that had plagued 
humans for millions of years. Sadly there isn’t an Emmy for that.'

Before giving all the plaudits to the 
writers of ‘Sex in the City’ it’s worth considering that other factors 
for the decline in pubic lice numbers could include the reluctance of 
patients to seek medical attention leading to self-treatment with 
over-the-counter insecticidal treatments, therefore causing a decline in
recorded numbers.

The research is due to be released at 
the British Association of Dermatologists’ Annual Conference in 
Liverpool next week.
