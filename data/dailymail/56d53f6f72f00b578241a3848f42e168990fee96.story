There are plenty of old friends returning in the Premier League this season but there are also many new faces and innovations.

Here, Sportsmail takes you through a few of them... 

Vanishing Spray

After its success at the World Cup, the spray dubbed as ‘shaving foam’ comes to England to help referees set up the wall at set-pieces.

Now you see it, now you don't: The vanishing spray will be used to mark out the wall at free-kicks

Controversial kits

West Brom’s controversial new pinstripes are the biggest talking point, whilst you either love or hate Liverpool’s third black and red third strip.

Crazy ticket prices

Arsenal have become the first team to charge more than £2,000 for a season ticket. Their top seat costs £2,013, a three per cent increase on last season.

Young talent

Expect new names to burst on to the Premier League scene, including Ander Herrera (Manchester United), Jordon Ibe (Liverpool), Sam Gallagher (Southampton) and Jack Grealish (Aston Villa).

Bursting on to the scene: Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe could be the next big thing in the Premier League

Managers

Louis van Gaal — Manchester United’s first foreign manager brings his 3-5-2 formation, whilst Ronald Koeman  joins Southampton. Nigel Pearson (Leicester), Sean Dyche (Burnley) and Alan Irvine (West Brom) will also manage at the top level for the first time.

Managers using Twitter

Koeman (@koeman1963) and has a Twitter account. Swansea manager Garry Monk (@garrymonk16) also shares his thoughts with 22,000 followers.

Ball

A whole new ball game: The Nike Ordem

Rounder than ever? Exactly. The Nike Ordem ‘is designed to fly perfectly made possible through perfect sphericity’. It has some fluorescent colours on it, too, so it’s easy to see.

Webb on the TV

Howard Webb may have retired as a referee but he will be appearing on the BBC, Sky and BT to explain decisions made by his former colleagues. 

Promoted clubs

Harry Redknapp will be back on Premier League patrol after winning the Championship play-off with QPR. Also up are Leicester and Burnley. 

Doctors

Every game will have a doctor to decide if players need to come off after head injuries.

A gaping hole at Old Trafford

This is the first ever Premier League season when Ryan Giggs will not be playing. Still, he’ll be on the bench as Louis van Gaal’s No 2.

End of an era: Ryan Giggs turned out for the Class of 92 but will not play for Manchester United this season

Boots

Expect more orange, green, yellow and red footwear. Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling and the Flyknit Mercurial Superfly IV boot, knitted boots over his ankle.
