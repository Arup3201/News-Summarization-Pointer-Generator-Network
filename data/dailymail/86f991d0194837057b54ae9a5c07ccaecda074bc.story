Jesamine Hearsum, 32, from Stroud, beat, strangled and sexually assaulted her friend after holding her hostage when she refused to have sex with her

A lesbian woman beat, strangled and sexually assaulted her friend during a hour-long hostage ordeal after she refused to have sex with her.

Jesamine Hearsum, 32, stripped naked and repeatedly attacked the woman after trapping her in her home in Stroud, Gloucestershire. 

Gloucester Crown Court heard today that Hearsum even threatened the victim with a knife when she repeatedly refused her advances.

She later bombarded the victim with a series of texts and Facebook messages, even though she had already been arrested over the other offences.

But Hearsum was spared jail, despite pleading guilty to false imprisonment, sexual assault, assault by beating and harassment.

Judge Jamie Tabor QC sentenced Hearsum to two years prison, suspended for two years. He also imposed a three-year restraining order banning Hearsum from contacting the woman.

The defendant was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for 10 years.

At an earlier hearing, prosecutor Julian Kesner told the court  that Hearsum had rung her friend - who had a boyfriend - in July this year because she wanted to talk about problems in her relationship.

The victim then went to Hearsum's home, before they went together to a nearby pub. Hearsum had already drunk three cans of lager and drank another pint of beer at the pub, the court was told.

The pair returned to Hearsum's home at about 9pm and went inside.

But when the victim went to use the bathroom, she noticed the front door had been locked from the inside and the key was missing.

The woman told Hearsum she had to go home, but Hearsum replied that she was 'not going anywhere'.

Mr Kesner said: 'The lady was worried and she said to the defendant that she had to go. But the defendant replied that she was not going anywhere. 

'She repeatedly asked the victim to stay the night and go to bed with her. Her repeated invitations were declined.

'The defendant was acting in a bizarre way. She took all her clothes off and asked the lady for a kiss. This was again declined.'

The court heard how thing 'degenerated' after that, with Hearsum attempting to strangle the victim and punching her around the head.

He added: 'She started to strangle the victim who appears to have started to slump and lose consciousness. At that point the defendant stopped.

'The victim was in tears. The defendant put her clothes back on then attacked the victim again, grabbing her by the clothes and grabbing her breasts and undoing her jeans. 

'It was during that attack that the defendant pushed her hand inside the victim's trousers and knickers.'

The court heard how the victim managed to use her phone to contact her boyfriend on Facebook, who called the police.

But Hearsum still managed to attack her victim and threaten her with a knife before officers arrived at her home.  

Mr Kesner said: 'The victim succeeded in using her phone to contact her boyfriend on Facebook and asked him to call the police.

'The defendant saw her using the phone and when she knew she had called the police she started to punch her, once on the cheek and the rest on the top of the head. She stopped after a few minutes.

'She then went into the kitchen and returned with a knife with a serrated edge. She threatened the victim with it.'

When police arrived, Hearsum admitted the offences and was bailed. But she soon started sending the victim texts which - although not threatening - were harassing, the court was told.

Paul Grumbar, defending, said Hearsum was a woman who was 'emotionally immature, easily involved and easily hurt'. 

But a psychiatric nurse who had assessed Hearsum told the court she did not need any mental health treatment. 

Stephen Mooney, defending at the earlier hearing, said the victim had made a statement saying she did not want to see Hearsum jailed. She had been 'objective, rational and humane' towards Hearsum, he said. 

Talking about the defendant, Mr Mooney said: 'She is an unsophisticated woman who lacks confidence, loves animals and clearly can offer a lot to the world. She places great store in having a loving, caring, nurturing relationship. '

He also said that the alcohol and her anti-depressant medication had combined to create a 'dreadful cocktail of events' that night.
