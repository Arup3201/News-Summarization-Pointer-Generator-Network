Lionel Messi's brilliant nutmeg on James Milner left the Manchester City midfielder on his backside, Pep Guardiola covering his face and Twitter reacting to the Barcelona star's masterclass. 

It was Messi's second nutmeg of the match, having already inflicted the same embarrassment on Fernandinho after the Argentina captain's assist created the game's only goal for Ivan Rakitic.

'I've got my legs closed up here,' said Sky Sports commentator Gary Neville, who labelled the Milner nutmeg 'barbaric' and was among those admiring the tutorial from the world's best footballer.

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker settled the argument of who's better between the Barcelona star and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. 'Messi is indisputably the greatest player ever to don a pair of football boots. Don't even attempt to argue the point,' he tweeted.

Manchester United's Ashley Young simply wrote 'Messi WOW', while Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin added: 'Pep's reaction says it all.' He was referring to former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, sitting in the stands in awe, covering his eyes.

Liverpool defender Jose Enrique tweeted: 'If Messi played against City on his own, he would still win the game. [He] is amazing. Best in the world when he wants.' 

Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland echoed commentator Neville by 'watching the game with my legs closed' and Dutch manager Ruud Gullit added: 'OMG. Messi made Milner famous.'

Then there was Andre Schurrle who simply wrote 'again and again and again...' while darts player Adrian 'Jackpot' Lewis wrote: 'Messi could nutmeg a mermaid.'

A ‘nutmeg’ is the technique of rolling the ball between an opponent’s legs, and gains extra acclaim when the attacking player retains possession after performing the trick. 

The origins of the word have long been debated, with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy — a notion put forward by Countdown star Susie Dent, of Dictionary Corner, who on Wednesday night tweeted: ‘Nutmegging in football comes from the centuries-old slang ‘nutmegs’, meaning ‘testicles’. In case Messi is ever interested.’ 

However, the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in Cockney rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation, while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between America and England in the 18th century, when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the Atlantic. 

Being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster. It later caught on in football, implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked, or, nutmegged.

In Spanish, the skill is known as ‘cano’ or ‘tunel’. They’ve certainly got plenty of tunel vision at the Nou Camp thanks to Lionel Messi.
