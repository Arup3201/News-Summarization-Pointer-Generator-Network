The Seattle Seahawks fans have set a new noise record for loudest outdoor sports stadium, with their stomps and cheers so loud Monday night they triggered a detectable earthquake.

A University of Washington professor says the noisemaking of Seattle Seahawks' fans registered on a nearby seismometer with the same energy as a magnitude 1 or 2 earthquake during Seattle's 34-7 Monday victory over New Orleans.

The homemade temblor is dubbed the Beast Quake and Seahawks fans have rocked it before – in another game against the Saints in 2011.

'Beast Quake': A Seattle fan holds a sign that reads LOUDER as he yells during Monday's game. The combined cheers of fans were measured at a record-breaking 137.6 decibels

A University of Washington earth sciences professor says the legendary noisemaking of Seattle Seahawks' hometown fans registered on a nearby seismometer with roughly the same energy as a magnitude 1 or 2 earthquake.

John Vidale is director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. He says it's hard to compare the fans' half minute of stomping, jumping and shouting during a first quarter fumble return for a touchdown to the quick ‘pop’ of a small earthquake. Still he says, ‘the energy is very roughly the same.’

Vidale says the seismometer registered ’three or four more good bursts,’ which always coincided with Seahawks' touchdowns.

The UW seismometer in question is located just north of CenturyLink Field.

Loud league: Seahawks fans took back their title of loudest in the NFL Monday when they beat the previous record of 137.5 decibels by the Kansas City Chiefs by just .1 decibels

Seahawks fans previously set a record for audience noise at an outdoor stadium on September 15 with a roar that reached 136.6 decibels in a win over San Francisco.

The mark was topped by envious Kansas City Chiefs fans in October with 137.5 decibels.

According to NOLA.com, the Chiefs were so bent on beating the Seahawks fans record that prior to their attempt they flew in a Guinness Book of World Records adjudicator.

Now the crown has back to Seattle with an official Guinness measurement of 137.6 decibels at the December 2 game.

To put that in perspective, a jet engine at 100 feet is about 140 decibels.

The most intense rumble came after Seahawks' defensive end Michael Bennett recovered a fumble by New Orleans' quarterback Drew Brees in the first quarter and ran it back for a touchdown, said Vidale.
