Google is working on a plan to eliminate computer passwords and allow users to log-in using their smart phone or a small chip that can be embedded in rings and bracelets.

The company is trying out different options to create more secure ways for its 500 million users to use their accounts - and a more convenient method than remembering a host of passwords.

Google has been working with a company called Yubico - who make a USB device called a YubiKey which can be programed for a two-step, secure log-in.

Tighter controls: Google have been looking at plans to make their accounts more secure for users

However carrying around a token may not be seen as a positive change for many users so Google is exploring other options, according to Wired.

Google Vice President of Security 
Eric Grosse and engineer Mayank Upadhyay said that passwords and cookies
 are no longer enough to keep their users safe from hackers.

Google introduced a two-step log-in in 2011, making it more difficult for your account to be hacked - and it had a successful uptake among users.

Accounts are given tighter security by linking them to your smartphone. Each time a Google user logs in via a different computer, they receive a code in a text message to vouch for who they are - however even this plan has its flaws.

People may find that they are just as likely to lose a token as forget a password.

There is also the issue that if the device is lost or stolen, then an individual's accounts would be wide open.

Safety first: The YubiKey USB device works by being plugged into the computer and then entering a password for tougher security on the Internet
