A ‘superwheat’ created by British scientists could increase crop yields by up to a third.

In one of the biggest potential advances for farming in a generation, researchers have cross-bred modern wheat seed with ancient wild grass species to produce a more resilient, productive crop.

Researchers at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) said the new 'superwheat' could be combined with current varieties to boost drought tolerance, disease resistance, as well as their yield.

In early field trials, the new crop was 30 per cent more productive than conventional wheat, and could be available to farmers as soon as 2019.

The process of producing the synthetic 'superwheat' is similar to selective breeding and does not use genetic-modification.

It could also spell good news for the consumer, with increased production promising to keep down prices for bread, biscuits and pasta.

Britain is set to become a net importer of wheat for the first time in more than a decade after last year's terrible weather. Farmers fear the trend will continue next year, due to planting difficulties and seed shortages.

Earlier this month, it emerged McVitie's Digestives will no longer carry a logo stating the biscuits contain '100 per cent British Wheat' due to sourcing difficulties. Both Hovis and Weetabix have also had to drop their sourcing pledges.

Dr Tina Barsby, from the chief executive and director of NIAB, said modern cultivated wheat is the result of a cross between durum - used and goat grass that likely occurred in the Middle East 10,000 years ago.

The Cambridge-based team selected early wheat and grass varieties from seed banks across the globe and cross-bred them for maximum potential.

'This year our crop had a 30 per cent better yields, which took us a bit by surprise,' said Dr Barsby. 'Although to is in the early stages, we are very optimistic.

'In the past decade, our wheat yield had started to plateau off and we needed another increase in productivity to meet demand.

'It is about finding novel characteristics from the original ancestors of wheat and breeding them to make them as productive and resilient as possible.' Dr Barsby said the technique involved breeding selected species of wheat and grass, and that no GM-technology was involved.

'You can sometimes become too focused on one technology like GM and not look at other techniques that can bring you similar success,' she said.

Over the next 50 years, the world needs to grow more wheat than has been produced in the 10,000 years since agriculture began.

NFU President, Peter Kendall, also an arable farmer, said increased production will help keep future prices down.

'The trials show up to 30 per cent yield increase, which is truly fantastic. It is particularly good news, as we had to import wheat following last year's record wet weather and it will be a similar picture this year with a poor harvest expected.

'This is about increasing resilience and making ourselves self-reliant. We want to be able to feed ourselves and the rest of the world.'
