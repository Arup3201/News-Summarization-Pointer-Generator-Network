A maths teacher and his students have confirmed what many cookie lovers have long suspected – there simply isn’t as much creme filling in Double Stuf and Mega Stuf Oreos as the manufacturers claim.

Dan Anderson, who teaches at a high school in Queensbury, New York, decided the confusion surrounding Oreo fillings would be the perfect case study to engage his students in using maths in real life.

Anderson, 32, brought one package each of regular Oreos, Double Stuf and Mega Stuf to class.

A maths teacher and his students have confirmed what many cookie lovers have long suspected ¿ there simply isn't as much creme filling in Double Stuf as the manufacturers claim

The students weighed ten Mega Stuf Oreos, left, and ten Double Stuf Oreos, right

He then split his students into different groups, with some measuring the cookies' height and some their weight.

‘We weighed 10 of each - Double Stuf, Mega Stuf and regular,’ he told ABCNews.com. ‘And we weighed five wafers alone to deduct from the total.’

Using mathematical equations to determine the creme content of the cookies, Anderson's students found that the bigger Oreos didn’t include as much filling as their packaging suggested.

The Double Stuf Oreos were only 1.86 times the size of regular Oreos, rather than double as the name suggests.

According to Anderson and his students, Double Stuf Oreos were only 1.86 the size of a regular oreo and Mega Stuf Oreos were 2.68 the size of a regular cookie

According to the students' measurements, the Mega Oreos had 2.68 times the amount of creme of the regular Oreos.

While the packaging doesn’t get specific about how much creme is in each Mega Oreo it is fair to say expectations have been set higher than just over two and half times the amount in a regular cookie.

Anderson said his students were surprised by their findings, which he has documented on his A Recursive Process blog.

MailOnline reached out to Nabisco, which makes Oreos, for comment about the apparent lack of filling in its cookies.

They replied, 'While I’m
not familiar with what was done in the classroom setting, I can confirm for you
that our recipe for the Oreo Double Stuf Cookie has double the Stuf, or creme
filling when compared with our base, or original Oreo cookie.'

Anderson and his students also weighed 10 regular Oreos and five wafers to deduct from the various totals

Earlier this year Subway got into trouble with consumers after one man posted this photo of his not quite footlong sandwich

The discovery follows the revelation 
earlier this year by a man in Australia that sandwich chain Subway was 
selling supposed 'footlong' subs that were just 11 inches in length. He 
posted a photo on Facebook of his sandwich beside a measuring tape 
showing that it was a whole inch shorter than advertised.

Subway
responded by claiming that the word footlong is a 'registered trademark
as a descriptive name for the sub' and 'not intended to be a 
measurement of length.'
