An American Airlines flight attendant is suing the airline after allegations were made by her colleagues that she had smuggled her pet rats inside her underwear and pantyhose onto an international flight.

Long Island flight attendant Louann Giambattista, 55, says the accusations have resulted in her being blacklisted by customs for more than a year.

The 33-year industry veteran is seeking damages for 'debilitating anxiety' and post-traumatic stress disorder from the airline.

Suing: Louann Giambattista was routinely scrutinized by customs officials after colleagues alleged she smuggled rats onto planes in her pants

Ratted out: Louann Giambattista's colleagues told ICE officials they suspected she had smuggled rats onboard an American Airlines flight in her underwear and hosiery

In February 2012, a pilot reported that Giambattista had 'a bulge in [her] pocket' and saw 'what he thought was a live pet,' according to papers filed in Brooklyn federal court.

Another colleague reported that on a flight to Miami that same day, she saw Giambattista feeding a pet rat. Giambattista claims that the bread roll in a paper cup was not for feeding a rat but rather herself, and that the cup was to avoid looking unprofessional in front of passengers.

According to the court papers, colleagues on the Miami flight smelled a rat and dobbed Giambattista in to customs officials upon landing in Florida.

Rat race: As a result of the allegations of rat-smuggling, American Airlines put a flag on Giambattista's passport but wouldn't take her off international flights

She says she was questioned and had her luggage searched for more than an hour, but the agents didn't find any rats.

Nevertheless, Giambattista claims the airline put a flag on her passport as a result of the accusations, meaning that every trip through customs became a lengthy ordeal and ICE agents bullied her and threatened her with a strip search, and that it became 'nearly impossible for [her] to report to work.'

Rat-finks: Despite Giambattista's colleague's claims, no rats were ever found about her person

According to the New York Post, Giambattista is an admitted animal lover, but her lawyer says she knows there's a time and a place for pets.

'Everybody has pets - she has her pets at home, not at work,' Stephen Morelli said. 'She’s not a nut. They’re making her out to be a nut.'

'She’s got a lot of different pets. She had the rat - it died.'

Giambattista told the Post that the claims she smuggled a rat on board a flight are 'absurd' and 'patently false'.

'There was no reason for it,' she said. 'People say, "There must have been a reason" but there was none.'

She says she was made an example of in front of colleagues and questioned in a communal break room where other colleagues could witness her interrogation.
