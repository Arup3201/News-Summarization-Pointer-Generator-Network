A shocking video has emerged of an Iraq veteran and off-duty cop being beaten up by opposing ice hockey fans after a big game between rivals.

New York Rangers fan Neal Auricchio Jr, 30, received the brutal beating from three Philadelphia Flyers fans after the game on Monday night.

The former Marine, who has worked as a policeman in Woodbridge, New Jersey, for four years, went to hospital with concussion after the attack.

Video: The first hit was made by a man with a #28 Claude Giroux Flyers shirt on a man wearing a #24 Ryan Callahan Rangers shirt, whose identity is unknown

Brawl: Then the Rangers fan tried to fight back but was quickly pushed to the ground and two other Flyers fans joined in the attack

‘He got banged up pretty badly,’ his father Neal Auricchio Sr told NBC New York. ‘Stitches in the one eye and the other eye is pretty puffed up’.

‘He's angry, he's upset. It's out there in public domain and it was just a couple of cheap shots by people who got a little excessive.’

The fight happened after New York Rangers beat Philadelphia Flyers 3-2 in the Winter Classic game at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.

Mr Auricchio, who is married with a young son, was beaten outside famous Philadelphia cheesesteak restaurant Geno's Steaks in the video.

Police claim Flyers fans, in orange, paid a man cleaning vehicle windows to spray a Rangers fan with a liquid, reported NBC New York.

Annoyed: The Marine veteran's father Neal Auricchio Sr told NBC New York that his son was left 'upset' and 'angry' by the attack after it went viral online

The first hit was made by a man with a #28 Claude Giroux Flyers shirt on a man with a #24 Ryan Callahan Rangers shirt, whose identity is unknown.

Philadelphia Flyers fan Edward Neary posted on Facebook that he was involved in the fight.

'It was me and my friends, do something about it,' he reportedly wrote on the Facebook page of the Broad Street Hockey blog.

But Mr Neary later backtracked from this claim and implicated two other men in the fight instead.

Then the Rangers fan tried to fight back but was quickly pushed to the ground and two other Flyers fans joined in the attack, the video shows.

Mr Auricchio got a Purple Heart medal for his services in Iraq and even returned there for a second time after he was shot in the leg, reported NBC New York.

Police are still looking for the men in the fight and posted the video on YouTube to help catch them.

‘This should not have happened to a good, decent young man who's truly a war hero,’ Woodbridge Mayor John McCormac told NBC New York.
