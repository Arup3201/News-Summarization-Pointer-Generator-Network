He should have flushed: Ramon Herrara, 33, allegedly left a lot behind in the Albuquerque home he's accused of robbing last month, including a dirty toilet

A New Mexico burglar who broke into a vacationing family's home has been nabbed with the help of DNA he left behind after downing a can of Coke and then using the toilet and failing to flush.

Ramon Herrera, 33, is accused of stealing $250,000 from a home in Albuquerque in September.

Police combed the scene and found a can of Coca-Cola with a note that read 'Sorry.' By then the thief had fled the scene, but cops found what was left of his soda.

According to the Albuquerque Journal, the homeowners found their sliding back door smashed when they arrived home.

The homeowners also discovered footprints leading out to a field and a sweatshirt stashed behind a wall near the house.

Police swabbed the can of Coke and also a flashlight that had been left behind.

Lucky for them, investigators didn't need to swab the sullied toilet.

'(The detective) failed to collect any samples from the used toilet,' says a court filing.

What they did collect, authorities say led them to Ramon. 

He was booked on charges of residential burglary and larceny over $20,000.

Herrera has since pleaded not guilty.
