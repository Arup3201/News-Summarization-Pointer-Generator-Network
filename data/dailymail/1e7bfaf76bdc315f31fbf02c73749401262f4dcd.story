Well, it's one way to try and get out of a fine.

But for one 19-year-old California man, it's just lead to a whole stack of additional charges.

Manual Montano Herrera was arrested in Marysville on Saturday after he was caught crashing into a red-light camera and then speeding off with it in the back of his truck.

Police say Herrera lost control of his blue Toyota pickup and slammed into the Redflex pole about 6.30am, according to News10.

Snapped: Manual Montano Herrera, 19, ran into a red-light camera in Marysville, California, on Saturday morning, and took off with it in the back of his truck. When he stopped at a nearby street to readjust the pole, a walker took a picture and called police

Scene: Police say Herrera struck this pole and the traffic camera, which was mounted where the traffic cone is in this picture

When Herrera hit the pole, it is said to have fallen straight into the back of his truck, witnesses say. He told police he didn't stop because he was late for work

Manual Montano Herrera was allegedly caught trying to dump the 6ft red light camera pole at a friend's house (pictured)

'The pole ended up flipping over into the back of the bed of the vehicle,' a paramedic who saw it unfold told CBS Sacramento.

'The vehicle sped off and actually stopped at the next light and turned the corner from there and took off.'

Herrera is said to have driven for about two miles before pulling over in a suburban street.

While adjusting the camera pole in the back of his truck, a witness took a photo.

The photo helped police identify Herrera by running his registration.

All that remained at the scene was torn wires that were attached to the camera

The teen was located some time later at a friend's house allegedly trying to dump the pole.

He told authorities he took off because he was late for work.

Herrera has now been charged with hit-and-run traffic collision and grand theft.
