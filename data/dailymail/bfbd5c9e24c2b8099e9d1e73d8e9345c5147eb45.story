A California man is dead after witnesses say he challenged police with what turned out to be a fake gun, prompting the officers to shoot him multiple times.

The unidentified white male, age 32, was reportedly behaving erratically in the parking lot of a Mission District police station in San Francisco. 

Officer Albie Esparza told reporters that police noticed the man in the parking lot at Valencia and 17th streets at about 5:20 p.m.

The area is restricted to the public.

ABC 7 News reports that the man started to leave after being confronted by three officers, then turned to challenge them just before reaching the parking lot entrance. 

As he began to back away facing the sergeants, Esparza says he moved his hands to his waistband and unveiled what looked like the butt of a gun.

"The sergeants saw the butt of the weapon as he pulls it out and brandishes it at the sergeants,' she said.

Two of the officers opened fire.

At least six or seven shots were fired, according to one witness at the scene, though its unclear how many of those shots may have hit the man. 

The weapon turned out to be an airsoft gun - good for shooting pellets but far from lethal.

'We don't know his motive or why he challenged the officers or approached them in the first place,' Esparza said. 'It was very erratic behavior by the suspect, very unusual.'

Earlier that day the same man attempted to interact with police at the corner of 16th and Mission streets in the middle of responding to a domestic violence call.

He'd asked them about their guns and ammunition, and if they'd ever been involved in shooting someone.

'(The officers) didn't really interact with him' Esparza said, according to CBS San Francisco. 'They were busy on a call and he was sort of loitering around.'

The man was transported to San Francisco General Hospital for surgery, but died there.

At approximately 8:30 p.m. Pacific time, theABC 7's Twitter feed reported that the man had died.
