Touch - even with something inanimate like a teddy - may genuinely help people with low self-esteem

Anyone with a beloved stuffed toy or teddy may believe they have genuine healing powers, but this is the first time science has confirmed it.

While most of us deal the prospect of our impending death by attempting to live meaningful lives, those with low self esteem often struggle with this.

Viewing themselves and their lives as worthless they can feel far more upset by existential thoughts than the rest of the population.

Now, research suggests that touch - even with something inanimate like a teddy - may genuinely help people with low self-esteem in confronting their own mortality.

In a series of studies published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, researchers from UV University Amsterdam tested the hypothesis that people with low self-esteem deal with concerns about their own death and the meaning of their life by connecting with others.

‘Even fleeting and seemingly trivial instances of interpersonal touch may help people to deal more effectively with existential concern,’ explains psychological scientist and lead researcher Sander Koole.

‘This is important because we all have to deal with existential concerns and we all have times at which we struggle to find meaning in life,’ he says.

Koole and colleagues tested the hypothesis that people with low self-esteem deal with existential concerns by connecting with others.

In one study, a researcher approached participants as they walked through a university campus.

She handed the participants questionnaires to fill out; for some of the participants, she accompanied the questionnaire with a light, open-palmed touch on the shoulder blade that lasted about one second.

Interestingly, participants with low self-esteem who received the brief touch reported less death anxiety on the questionnaire than those who had not been touched.

Those who had been touched also showed better social connectedness after being reminded of death in comparison to those who had not received the light pat.

The research also suggests that individuals with low self-esteem may desire, and even seek out, touch when they are confronted with their own death.

Participants with low self-esteem who were reminded of death estimated the value of a teddy bear at about €23 (about £19), while those who had not been reminded of death estimated the value at about €13 euros (£10), a full €10 less.

Being able to touch the teddy bear while estimating its value seemed to provide comfort to participants with low self-esteem, reducing their levels of common defensive reactions to reminders of death.

‘Our findings show that even touching an inanimate object — such as a teddy bear — can soothe existential fears,' notes Koole. 'Interpersonal touch is such a powerful mechanism that even objects that simulate touch by another person may help to instill in people a sense of existential significance.’

Koole and colleagues believe that touch could be a useful supplement to more traditional therapies in treating low self-esteem and related disorders, such as depression and anxiety.

The researchers are currently exploring the possibilities of simulated interpersonal touch through the use of a ‘haptic jacket,’ which can electronically give people the feeling that they are being hugged.
