The former wife of the disgraced 
financier Danny Porush has spoken about how she watched him transform 
from a wholesome husband into a bragging criminal.

Mother-of-three
 Nancy Porush has revealed how life dramatically changed after her 
crooked ex took up a life of fast money, which led to him being 
prosecuted and jailed for 39 months.

Miss
 Porush said: 'As a broker, Danny was raking in huge amounts of cash and
 spending it like crazy.

'I saw him morph from a nice wholesome guy into 
showy narcissist whom I hardly recognized anymore', the NY Post said.

'Danny
 changed with money; he’d frequently stay out late at night, saying he 
had a business meeting in the city that he couldn’t get out of. I was a 
young mom with two babies.

'I’m not stupid or naive — but I really didn’t know what was going on. I was home watching “Sesame Street” with our sons.

Miss
 Porush claims her ex even had her sign confusing documents. What she 
failed to realise was that he was putting assets in her name as part of 
the fraud he was committing.

She
 said: 'There were many victims Danny defrauded — but I was one of them.
 And the government validated that. Legally, I too was a victim.

I
 sold off everything to support my family — teaching yoga and pilates, 
selling clothes, skin care, anything to provide for the kids.'

Her outspoken 
comments came after a man once employed by the real Wolf of Wall Street 
revealed just what working at the dodgy Long Island firm Stratton 
Oakmont described in the film was like.

Josh Shapiro, 41, found himself 
caught up in the 1990s in a life of Quaaludes, prostitutes, and fooling 
investors under the guidance of infamous brokers Jordan Belfort and 
Danny Porush.

Now
 Shaprio has revealed to the New York Post that working for the men 
fictionalized by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill was a nightmare and 
that the snake oil salesmen have gotten off way too easy for their shady
 ways.

‘These people were some of the worst people that I have ever met in my life,’ Shapiro told the Post.

Shapiro
 arrived home to Long Island from the Marines in 1993 and soon got a job
 at Stratton Oakmont after his physician father suggested he enter the 
business co-owned by his partner’s son, Danny Porush.

Let the good times roll: Josh Shapiro worked for the real Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film (pictured), and says the drugs, hookers, and cash were plentiful

'I was blown away by the intensity': Shapiro was taken in by the lavish lifestyle and was soon making tens of thousands of dollars per month. Pictured is a still from the film

‘I was a little hesitant at first. I had no interest in stock brokerage. I didn’t know anything about it,’ he told the Post.

Porush is fictionalized in the film as Donny Azoff, played by Jonah Hill.

When Danny Porush told him he could make $100,000 per month, Shapiro leaped onboard.

‘I was blown away by the intensity,’ he said. ‘You could feel the pulse when you walked into the place.’

Soon, he realized that pulse was fueled with rampant drug use, among other vices.

‘He would come out at other times, completely stewed out of his mind on Quaaludes. Stand on the desk, then fall onto the floor. 

‘Or
 he would come out angry, pick up a computer — and these are the old CRT
 monitors — and smash it on the floor as hard as he possibly could. And 
be like, “You’re all a bunch of f- -king losers unless you push this 
f- -king stock!”

From 
lowly cold-calling pitch man, Shapiro worked his way to broker. He would
 spend his days speaking with investors from states away, urging them to
 buy whatever worthless stocks Stratton Oakmont was peddling.

‘You got the account, and then you 
started selling them on our IPOs — very enticing initially, but if you 
bought, you lost. There was no way to win,’ Shapiro said.

But
 even with this knowledge in mind, Shapiro said he was kept in the game 
with a steady supply of $500-an-hour hookers, Mexican Quaaludes, and 
sports cars courtesy of Belfort and Porush.

It was great, Shapiro said, until his conscious caught up to his freewheeling ways. 

‘I
 got to the point where I realized there was no way you could win. To 
this day, I still remember two clients’ names who lost all their money 
because of me. I think they’re dead now, but I did think about making 
amends. Now it’s too late,’ he said.

Shapiro left the firm, which was soon
 shut down by the FBI. Belfort and Porush were prosecuted. But Shapiro 
isn’t convinced they’ve truly done their time.

'Revered like nothing else': Shapiro says Belfort (pictured) was behind the scenes, but a god, and that 'it was all his idea'

Money to burn: Shapiro says the brokers would rip up $100 bills as a motivator for fledgling pitch men. Pictured is a still of DiCaprio from the film

‘Madoff
 got years in prison, and these guys have gotten off easy — 22 months 
for Belfort, 39 months for Porush — for ripping off $200 million,’ he 
said.

Now, Shapiro is 
out of the finance game completely and works as a physician assistant. 
He says he’s trying to help people instead of harming them.

‘When
 I am giving back, I get a good feeling,’ he said. ‘I feel like I am 
absolving myself. But the guilt follows you a little bit, still.’

It all crumbled: Eventually, the shady deals caught up with the brokerage. Stratton Oakmont was shut down by the FBI just months after Shapiro left. He's now a physician assistant. pictured is a still of DiCaprio
