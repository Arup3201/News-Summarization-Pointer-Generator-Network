Authorities say a wild black bear ate most of a Northern California man who likely died earlier of a heart attack in his trailer and was pulled from the site by the animal.

Local Deputy Coroner Roy Horton said Friday he believes 65-year-old Marion Williams died outside his trailer in a remote area of southern Humboldt.

Authorities discovered the remains on Monday. 

Friends of the father-of-two - a popular community volunteer who also went by the name Rainbow Mountain Walker - became worried when he didn't show up for a planned motorcycle ride on Saturday, according to local newspaper The Lost Coast Outpost.

Body found: Marion Williams, 65 - also known as Rainbow Mountain Walker - was found almost completely eaten in the woods near his trailer in a remote area of Southern Humboldt, California

Scene: Williams, a father-of-two, lived in a trailer in a remote part of Southern Humboldt, near Redway, Calif.

Then a friend when to Williams' home on Sunday to check on him.

Upon arriving he noticed the trailer was in disarray, but Williams' cellphone, keys and vehicle were still there.

When the friend couldn't find Williams, he did a call around

A search party was organized for Monday and the body was found nearby.

Williams' daughter, Liberty, told The Outpost it was obvious her father's body had been dragged off by a large animal, most likely a bear. 

Authorities identified the body using fingerprints.

California Department of Fish and Wildlife spokesman Andrew Hughan says officials want to trap and kill the bear but have called off their search because it is doubtful the bear is still in the area near Redway, about 75 miles south of Humboldt.

Animal encounter: Authorities believe a black bear happened across the dead body of Marion Williams, dragged it off into the woods and ate it. Pictured here is a black bear in Sequoia National Park, California 

They have not released a cause of death for Williams, but there is evidence he died before the attack.

That evidence was not disclosed.

Williams' daughter described him as 'an open-hearted, caring person who wanted to help everyone out… . He wanted to see his community do better', according to The Outpost.

Every year he would serve Christmas and Thanksgiving to the homeless.

Helping street people was a great passion of his.

A memorial is currently being organized.
