Mexican drug cartels are now smuggling higher grade and more expensive marijuana grown in the US south of the border.

According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the alleged smuggling involves marijuana grown by American entrepreneurs in states that allow marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, most recently Oregon and Alaska.

DEA spokesman Lawrence Payne said the agency learned of the trafficking from intelligence operations - but said the scale of the operation is not known.

The DEA believes Mexican drug cartels are smuggling high-grade marijuana from the US south of the border. Pictured, a Homeland Security operative in a secret tunnel discovered last year between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, which was linked to the Sinaloa cartel

He told U.S. News:  'Traffickers who are operating in the U.S. are securing marijuana in the U.S. that is much higher quality and more expensive for the purpose of smuggling back into Mexico for sale and distribution.

'Much of this marijuana is being grown [and] obtained in states that have relaxed their marijuana laws, such as Colorado. 

'[It's] too early to really know the level or scale of the trafficking southward.'

Earlier this week, NPR reported that domestic sales of marijuana are undercutting the operations of Mexican cartels - and as a result, the Sinaloa Cartel is smuggling US grown marijuana into Mexico, mainly from Colorado.

Mr Payne told the broadcaster: 'It makes sense...If you can buy some really high-quality weed here, why not smuggle it south, too, and sell it at a premium?'

It has been reported that domestic sales are undercutting the operations of Mexican drug cartels, who have resorted to smuggling American pot south to sell at a premium

Nabor, a 24-year-old marijuana grower from the northwestern state of Sinaloa, told NPR that if the U.S continues to legalize pot - and more than half of states already have - 'they'll run us into the ground'. 

But supporters use eliminating the violence associated with cartels and organized crime as an important argument for legalization.
