A devoted mother was stabbed to death by her ‘wicked and callous’ former partner who could not accept that she wanted to give her marriage another try for the sake of her children.

Jeanette Goodwin, 47, broke off the long-term relationship with Martin Bunch, 44, and went back to her husband of 21 years, Mark.

The couple were at home preparing a barbecue when Bunch forced his way into the garden through a gap in the fence and launched the fatal attack. Mrs Goodwin bled to death on her patio after a 5in blade was plunged into her chest more than 20 times as Bunch crowed: ‘I told her I would kill her.

At the time, he was under a 
restraining order banning him from contacting his ex-partner or going to
her house in Southend, following his arrest for harassing her.

He remained free despite repeatedly 
breaching the conditions and the mother of three informing police she 
had been told he planned to kill her.

Bunch was found guilty of murder after
a four-week trial at Chelmsford Crown Court and faces a mandatory life 
sentence when he is sentenced on Friday.

Judge Charles Gratwicke said: 
‘This was a wicked, callous and violent crime for which he has shown 
absolutely no remorse whatsoever. He should expect a really substantial 
prison sentence.’

Mr and Mrs Goodwin married in 1990. 
They had three children – Samantha, 21, Charles, 18 and Harry, 14 – but 
their marriage went through a rough patch and they separated.

Mrs Goodwin began an eight-year 
relationship with Bunch which came to an end in late 2010 when she told 
him she was going to give her marriage another try.

The labourer began bombarding her with
calls and was charged with harassment.

Magistrates released him on bail
after imposing the restraining order but, less than a month before her 
death, Mrs Goodwin told police she had received unwanted voicemails, 
texts and visits from Bunch, who had also told his mother he planned to 
kill her.

She said: ‘This behaviour has left me fearful for my life. I just want him to leave me alone.’

Bunch was arrested again on July 14 
for removing a tag used to check he was observing a curfew but on July 
20 he was again granted bail at Southend Magistrates’ Court.

Four days 
later, Mrs Goodwin saw him outside her home. She did not report it to 
police immediately because she refused to let him spoil a ‘lovely 
summer’s afternoon’.

At around 7.30pm she pressed a panic 
alarm. Police arrived six minutes later but she had already been 
stabbed. Her children were not at home at the time.

Bunch, of Southend, was found at his mother’s house 30 minutes later clutching a 5in kitchen knife.

He denied murder, claiming he did not remember what happened, but was found guilty by a unanimous verdict on Tuesday.
