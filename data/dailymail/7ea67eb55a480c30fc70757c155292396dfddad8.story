A pair of pranksters dressed up as a pantomime horse were thrown out of a Tesco supermarket after trotting around the frozen beef burger aisle shouting 'murderers'.

A video of the incident, believed to have taken place in a Welsh store, has already racked up nearly 50,000 hits on YouTube.

The mobile phone footage shows the pantomime horse rolling on the floor near the frozen food aisle shouting 'where's my mum?' before a security guard asks them to leave.

Earlier this week Tesco was one of several UK supermarkets revealed to have quantities of horse meat in its frozen burgers.

The alert was first raised by Irish food watchdogs after horse DNA was found in burgers sold through Tesco, Iceland, Aldi, Lidl and Dunnes in Ireland.

It subsequently emerged that burgers from the same batches were sold in the British outlets of both Tesco and Iceland.

Incredibly, the beef content in one Everyday Value burger sold by Tesco was actually 29 per cent horse meat.

More than ten million burgers have now been removed from sale, including more than 100,000 made at the Yorkshire factory of Dalepak.

Tesco, Sainsburyâ€™s, Asda and the Co-op immediately decided to remove thousands of packs of frozen burgers as a precautionary measure.

David Cameron reacted angrily, condemning Tesco yesterday, saying: 'People in our country will have been very concerned to read this morning that when they thought they were buying beef burgers they were buying something that had horse meat in it.'

'This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs,' he added, calling for an urgent investigation by Britain's Food Standards Agency.

Scandal: How the Daily Mail covered the story on Wednesday

Labour says comprehensive food tests are needed to let families know how far horse meat contamination has spread into the food supply.

Also today, it was revealed there is no evidence of contamination of horse DNA in Burger King products, a major food group has insisted.
