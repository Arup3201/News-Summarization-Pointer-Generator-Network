‘They moved towards her and then shot her,’ Alan Sobbi, 45, said.

‘We live facing the Hungry Jack's. We had a view of the whole thing.

‘We heard two shots. The police and ambulance came from all over the place. Ambulance took about 10 to 15 minutes to get there.

‘We heard a bang, bang and everything came to a standstill,’ Mr Sobbi said.

‘The girl was the only one outside. We think she was trying to hold up the petrol station. An incident happened near the service station last week. Policemen chasing the person but there were no shots that time.

‘My son said he saw something in her hand. We saw a group of police officers with some trying to revive her,’ he added.

His daughter Emily Sobbi, 21, said: ‘It was shocking. It was hard to see someone being revived for their life outside my window.’

Aymen Sobbi, 17, said he was about to take a shower before the incident happened.

'I looked out the window... and saw two police officers get out [of their car],' he said.

Forensic teams took photos and gathered evidence from the street corner where the woman was shot

Aymen recalled seeing a police officer wave his arms above his head and seconds later heard two gun shots 'one after another'.

'At that moment I was quite shocked, I called my sister to come up,' he said. 

Before the woman was shot, Aymen said she was holding food in her hands, but was unable to confirm if she was behaving erratically.

'She was just standing there at the time as I was getting ready,' he said.

After the woman was shot, Aymen said police worked to revive her for about half an hour to 45 minutes.  

Another witness, who did not want to be named, said he was stopped in his car 30 metres away and saw police shoot the girl.

Police tape has cordoned off the streets and roads have been closed 

‘Basically I just saw a girl run away from the Hungry Jack's, servo area to the corner of Cowpasture Road,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘There were four or five officers basically running towards her and she was trying to run away and the copper just shot her in the stomach. 

‘She was surrounded by all four corners so the only way out was to run towards a cop anyway, it would have been a hard situation.

The witness said he didn’t see anything in her hands.

‘I saw her put her hands up and saw her put her hands down towards her belt and then she got shot,’ he said.

‘She may have been trying to grab something. I didn’t see a big butcher’s knife in her hand or her lunge at police.’ 

Police were called to the fast food restaurant at West Hoxton shortly before midday

All circumstances surrounding the incident before the 'discharge of a firearm' will be investigated

The witness said police immediately began trying to revive her.

‘Basically the cops scrambled all over her and they had her on her back trying to revive her,’ he said.
