John McEnroe has said it is time for Andy Murray to 'step up' at the US Open after the Brit's struggles on tour this year.

Murray is seeded No 8 at Flushing Meadows - his lowest Grand Slam seeding for more than six years - after failing to win a title since his Wimbledon triumph in July 2013.

The 27-year-old has found it difficult to rediscover his best form consistently since undergoing back surgery last September and was hit hard by his split with coach Ivan Lendl in March.

Tough going: Andy Murray has struggled to rediscover his best form since undergoing back surgery

McEnroe, who will compete in December's Statoil Masters Tennis event at London's Royal Albert Hall, said: 'It’s difficult to say what’s happening with Andy.

'It seems like the physical issues are behind him - it’s impossible to say for sure from the outside but that’s how it looks.

'It’s been a process for him to come back from those issues so that takes its toll on the confidence, and he made a big change - I thought he and Ivan worked well together.'

'To change course when he did is tricky so it remains to be seen what happens there. You need to give it more time to judge, but you sort of feel like the US Open would be a time he needs to step up because it’s been a struggle compared to what it’s been the last couple of years.'

Murray, who won his first Grand Slam at the 2012 US Open, will reunite with new coach Amelie Mauresmo in New York after the Frenchwoman took a break while her charge competed in last week's Cincinnati Masters.

This is only the second Grand Slam that Mauresmo has prepared Murray for - and McEnroe feels that time will tell whether the partnership will be a success or not.

McEnroe said: 'Amelie Mauresmo’s appointment was a little out of left-field and an unusual choice, but she’s had some coaching experience and she’s been out there herself so she can bring things to the table.

'You always need to give these things some time to see how they relate to each other and whether she can make that little difference.

'Can she help him find that extra two to five percent? That’s the key. It remains to be seen.'

Roger Federer sent out a timely warning ahead of the US Open as the 33-year-old won his first Masters title for two years in Cincinnati on Sunday.

But while 17-time Grand Slam champion Federer has looked like his old self on court recently, his Wimbledon conqueror Novak Djokovic has slumped to last-16 defeats in both Cincinnati and Toronto.

McEnroe, however, feels that world No 1 Djokovic is still the favourite to lift the US Open trophy this summer.

The American said: 'Roger looks great - he’s looked the best of all the top guys this summer.

'I think Novak had an incredible run at Wimbledon and it seems to me he is waiting for the Open.

'I don’t think it matters a whole lot what’s happened with his results in the summer. To me, he’s still the favourite going in.

'There’s a cast of other characters that will want to break through and finally put their names in the record books, and the most obvious ones are (Grigor) Dimitrov and (Milos) Raonic, but Djokovic is still the favourite.'

The Statoil Masters Tennis will be held at the Royal Albert Hall on 3-7 December. Tickets are available at www.Statoilmasterstennis.com
