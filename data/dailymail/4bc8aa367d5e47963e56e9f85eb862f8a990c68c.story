American entrepreneur Jim Clark has seen his hard work and innovative ideas in the world of computer technology pay off big time, to the tune of $1.4 billion, and now he has set his sights on the sea - with a yacht.

The Texas born Clark, a co-founder of Netscape, has just launched Comanche, a super-fast super yacht that took a year to build at cost millions of dollars.

The 100-foot long cutting edge vessel is sleek, stylish and, according to CNN, can reach a top speed of around 40mph.

Thing of beauty: Comanche is a 100-foot super yacht that took a year to build and had its maiden voyage in Newport, Rhode Island (above) earlier this month

Fast: The sleek and stylish vessel can reach a top speed of 40mph

It is an investment that is well worth it for Clark if the yacht does what many believe it will do, and breaks a series of offshore racing marks.

That being said, it does seem like an odd hobby for a man who grew up in Plainview, Texas, far from any coastline.

'People spend money on sports and I just don't do golf, I hate it,' said the 70-year-old. 

'But I love sailing and the technology aspect.'

He became interested in sailing while in the Navy, and bought his first boat in the late 1980s.

Not cheap: The boat also cost  millions to build

Maiden voyage: The yacht's first race is expected to be the Sydney-Hobart in Australia this December

Good crew: The yacht's skipper is Ken Read, the celebrated American sailor who grew up in Newport

Now, with Comanche, he wants 'to be a record breaker.'

He already plans on selling the boat in two years, and in that time has high hopes of not just winning events such as Transatlantic, Transpac, Fastnet, and Middle Sea, but breaking records as he takes the top spot. 

It had its maiden voyage off Newport, Rhode Island, on October 13, which was photographed by George Bekris, but Comanche's first race will be the Sydney-Hobart in Australia this December, one that is a particular favorite for Clark and his Australian wife, Kristy Hinze.

Busy schedule: The boat is also expected to compete in events including Transatlantic, Transpac, Fastnet, and Middle Sea

Not competing: 70-year-old Clark has said that he will not be on board for some of the more competitive races

In his place: His much younger wife Hinze, who is 35, will likely be part of the crew in Sydney

That being said, the Sydney-Hobart is also one of the most difficult and competitive races of the year, and will be a true test for Comanche and its 21 person crew led by skipper Ken Read, the very accomplished and celebrated 53-year-old sailor who grew up in Newport.

The 1998 race featured a freak storm that ultimately left six people dead.

'We want records but we have to win the races first and then think about the records,' said Read. 

'But to do that the conditions have to be right. You can have the greatest thing since sliced bread but you won't go record breaking if the weather's not right. But if we get into the record books -- and we believe we will - then it's job done.'

Priorities: Read has said of breaking records with Comanche, 'We want records but we have to win the races first and then think about the records'

Tough start: The boat's first race, Sydney-Hobart, is considered one of the most competitive and had one of the most difficult courses

Late start: Read did not even buy his first sailboat until the late 1980s

And while Clark may be too old to be on board for some of the more competitive races, his 35-year-old wife seems more than ready, starting on December 26 in Sydney.

'My wife's an Australian and a very competitive lady and she wants to sail in Sydney-Hobart,' said Clark. 

'I say "we have the boat, do as you wish." I'll let her run the show.'
