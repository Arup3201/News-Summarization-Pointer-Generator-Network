Host commentator

It's all over at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea complete their pre-season campaign with a 2-0 win against the Spanish side.

That's seven wins for Jose Mourinho's side as they now await the opening Premier League game against Burnley on Monday.    

The game was all but over after eight minutes as Costa marked his Stamford Bridge debut with two well-taken goal.

89mins: Oscar almost puts the Blues into a 3-0 lead after brilliant build-up play from Willian and Salah, but the Sociedad keeper was equal to the Brazilian's strike.

 

Matt Barlow: Mourinho has just made his tenth change with Andreas Christensen on for Terry.

All his outfield players have been substituted. Only Courtois is still on out of the starters.

The rest of the team lines up with Azpilicueta, Zouma, Chistensen and Luis across the back four.

Mikel and Van Ginkel deep in midfield.

Willian, Oscar and Salah across the pitch behind Torres.

And that's it at Old Trafford and Van Gaal as his first win at his new home. A second half strike from Fletcher put United ahead before Rodrigo levelled the scoring with 70 minutes on the clock.

The Red Devils showed Van Gaal their winning spirit as Fellaini struck in stoppage time after a defensive mix-up gifted the much-maligned midfielder his first goal for United.

Fellaini has scored what will surely be the winner for United! He challenged the Valencia keeper who missed his catching allowing the big Belgian to tap into empty ney.

Giggs seemed to be in fits of laughter on the bench as Van Gaal scribbled some notes.  

75mins: Torres heads just over after brilliant work down the left from Luis. It wasn't quite a sitter, but you wouldn't imagine Costa missing the target from there...

71mins: Fabregas is given an excellent reception from the Chelsea faithful as he is replace by Mikel.

The Spaniard has been brilliant tonight and seems to have already forged a brilliant midfield relationship with Matic.

82mins: De Gea is forced into action as he makes a quick-fire double save to keep Valencia out. The Spanish keeper dives well to his left but allows the ball to skid away from him towards the onrushing Rodrigo.

78mins: Rooney shoots agonisingly wide as he finds space on the edge of the box. He has his head in his hands as he clearly thinks it should now be 2-1 to United.

There is to be no hat-trick for Costa as Fernando Torres replaces the £32million signing.

The Chelsea crowd have loved what they've seen and get to their feet in admiration.

Valencia level the score in the 70th minute after a brilliant volley from Rodrigo at the far post.

54mins: Costa is inches away from a hat-trick on his Stamford Bridge debut as he first a Hazard cross just wide.

Excellent from from Chelsea as Willian released Hazard before the Belgian darted to the byline to cross. 

46mins: Luis introduces himself to the Chelsea crowd with a burst down the left before crossing for the onrushing Willian.

The ball is cleared for a Chelsea corner which comes to nothing. 

Several changes made by Mourinho ahead of the second half.

Luis, Azpilicueta, Willian and Oscar come on as Cahill, Schurrle, Ake and Ramires make way. Ivanovic moves into the centre-back position alongside Terry. 

Adam Crafton: Emotional moment for Darren Fletcher. After celebrating with his team-mates, he raised his arms to the Stretford End and showed his gratitude.

He has shown such courage to return from the debilitating bowel disorder and there are few at Old Trafford who are more appreciated than the Scot.

He looks as fresh and dynamic as he has for several years

And United have the lead as Fletcher strokes the ball home from 15-yards out. Young floated in a corner, which was cleared straight to the right boot of Fletcher who found a deflection to put his side ahead.

Chelsea in control as the game takes a pre-season pace. 

Half-time at Old Trafford and it's still 0-0. Not too much to shout about for Van Gaal after Rooney misses the chance to put United ahead with a first half penalty.

The United striker smashed his spot-kick against the foot of the post in what was his team's best chance to go ahead.

Valencia have looked threatening on the counter-attack, but Jone and Smalling have coped well. 

Matt Barlow: Real Sociedad have flickered into life since going two down. Chelsea may have eased off a bit. Suddenly it has the air of… well, a pre-season friendly, after an intense opening eight minutes.

The rain has stopped and Mourinho has emerged from the tunnel, where he was sheltering to prowl the touchline. His team are still 2-0 up.

Adam Crafton: Not the most inspiring of beginning to the Louis van Gaal era at Old Trafford but one majestic pass from Ander Herrera has lit up Old Trafford. Driven with the laces across the field and a super cross from Young.

Not sure about the fall from Rooney. Unlucky with the penalty, as it cannons off the post. Almost hit it too well.

Rooney cannons his spot-kick off the post and the score stays at 0-0.

It's a soft one, but Rooney seemed to get a slight nudge in the back before going down in the Valencia box. 

31mins: Rooney tries his luck with a free-kick from 18-yards but the United striker hits the ball just over the bar.

26mins: Herrera goes forward with the ball before spraying it out to Mata who gives the ball away for Valencia to attack through Rodrigo. 

The Spanish side are growing into the game, but there have been few chances.

He has another! Costa scores again just eight minutes into the game.

Matt Barlow: Games kicks off in the torrential downpout.Costa scores in second min. Pass from Ramires. Good low finish at the Shed end.

Costa scores just seconds into his Stamford Bridge debut as he hammers home a pass from Ramires.

Valencia have started well, but United are in control.

Some great pictures here as Chelsea took part in a pre-season lap of appreciation.

And we're underway at Old Trafford as youngster Blackett gets in the action early before Ashley Young loses the ball in Valencia's half. 

Jose Mourinho: 'All our new arrivals offer us great qualities on the pitch and they are fantastic people with strong personalities,” wrote Jose Mourinho in his programme notes.

'In pre-season so far, step-by-step, game-by-game, they are beginning to understand the way the team works and all of them are ready for the challenge of the Premier League. The squad is how we want it to be and we feel strong ahead of the new season.'
