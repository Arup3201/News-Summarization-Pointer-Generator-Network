It has barely changed in 100 years.

But a proposed redesign for the dollar has left Americans up in arms. 

Instead of the archetypal green and trusty old presidents, the revamped version would feature astronauts, molecules and stars in a series of motifs about innovation.

US artist Travis Purrington, who developed the designs for his thesis at Switzerland's Basel School of Design, said: 'One day we Americans will make a significant move in our currency design that reinforces the evolution of our cultural climate...this is where I would start'.

Controversial: An American artist has released these images for a proposed redesign of the dollar bill

An aerial view of fields is printed on the proposed $5 bill.

The $10 note, according to Purrington, would feature a building or a molecule.

New $20 bills would be adorned with a sparkling purple wave.

Moving up to $50, we have an astronaut.

And the peak of $100 is a mountain range or a starry sky.

Each bill is printed with similar font to the euro, with a muted gray border.

Muted: The paper notes would feature fields and molecules instead of revered presidents and dollar signs

Dramatic change: Instead of the archetypal green, Purrington would switch the bills to a light gray 

Change: The artist, based in Switzerland, says currency should reflect the evolution of our cultural climate

Purrington was inspired by competitions held in European countries that let members of the public suggest new currency designs.

'This idea of such a strong visual change every 20 years or so within a relatively conservative culture deeply rooted in banking lead me to ask, "Why couldn't the U.S. do this?"' Purrington told Slate.

'And subsequently, 'What would it look like if the U.S. held such a competition?' '

Responding to his critics, Purrington insists the thesis was merely an attempt to inspire new designs.

Innovation: Purrington was inspired by American innovation as well as European design features

The big bucks: Wealthy Americans could fill their wallets with mountain ranges and starry skies

Alternative: For those not fond of the nature photographs, he also fashioned scientific designs

How it would work: For his thesis, Purrington demonstrated the ways in which the note could work in practise

'I simply wanted to introduce the idea that there is still room to grow and innovate in U.S. culture with currency,' he told Slate.

'I'm not declaring that this proposal is a suitable replacement for the USD as much as I'm suggesting that one could exist,' he said.  

He insists the idea is not ultramodern as it maintains paper form. But he assures his critics that it is 'transitional', not realistic.

His inspiration came from European design movements of the 20th century and his observations since moving to Europe.

'I tried to tie the concept of learning, discovery, authorship, and accountability into the notes in a way that was aesthetically conducive to the organisation of information more than I worried if it looked too European or not "American" enough,' Purrington wrote.

1914: The first Federal Reserve $100 note is 7.3x3.1 inches with Franklin on the front and figures on the back

1929: It is reduced to 6.1x2.6 inches, Franklin's portrait is changed, and Independence Hall is put on the back

1990-1996: In the first revamp in 70 years, the bill was marginally altered, keeping Franklin and the Hall

1996-2013: Franklin got a close-up six years later, when the numbers were made bold and borders straight

2013-present: The Liberty Bell was added, as was a 3D security belt, in the latest redesign issued last year
