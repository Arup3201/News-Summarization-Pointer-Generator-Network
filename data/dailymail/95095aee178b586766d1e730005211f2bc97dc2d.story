For most dogs, Christmas is the time to bundle around in festive wrapping paper, or sneak the last scraps of the  turkey dinner from under the dining room table. 

But for these adorable canines and cats, Christmas is yet another day spent waiting to be chosen by a loving family to be welcomed into a new home. 

More than 180 animals will spend today at the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home's flagship centre in south west London, where they will be looked after by a team of volunteers.

Each year, a handful of workers postpone their turkey dinners to tend to the animals residing here and at other shelters across the country.

Among the pets are those who have been rescued in the run-up to Christmas, who will be treated to renditions of Silent Night and donated toys. 

But there are also those who will be spending their second Christmas at the centre, after being rejected for adoption thousands of times over the past 12 months. 

Ros Davies is one of those who will be manning the Battersea home today.

Although she works as a rehomer in the cattery, she spends Christmas Day playing Saint Nick instead.

Ms Davies said: 'We're full at the moment. There's 83 pens in the cattery and they've all got at least one cat in them.

'A lot of people very kindly donated toys and treats for the cats, so we've got a big pile of presents to give out to them ... We dish 'em all out so that there's enough for every cat, and some left over.'

Ms Davies said the cats got into the Christmas spirit early this year,  with stockings outside each pen and the cattery being decked out in beautiful decorations which are 'much better than the dogs'.

Meanwhile, over in the kennels, canine welfare trainer Nathalie Ingham has been playing carols to keep her charges from fretting. 

She said: 'We've got nice calm Christmas songs going at the moment. Silent Night, stuff like that.'

She was hoping for a white Christmas this year, an added adventure for the mischievous animals.

She said: 'It's really nice to see how they respond to things like snow - some dogs are just mesmerised by it and don't quite understand what they're walking on.

'Others just go crazy for snow and have loads of fun charging around. It's a nice time of year to be here, lots of different things, and everyone's a bit more laid-back,' she said.  

Rehomer Laura Cushway has one Christmas present in mind.  

She has her fingers crossed that one of the 'long-stays' will find a home these holidays - like Lola, who spends her nights in foster care but has been waiting patiently for a permanent home for more than two months.

But Lola has nothing on Biscuit, in the home's Old Windsor branch in Berkshire, who has now spent more than half his life waiting for a home.

The two-year-old mongrel arrived as a stray in February 2013 and has watched on as nearly 5,000 other dogs have found new homes.

Making a last-ditch pre-Christmas plea this week, the Old Windsor centre's manager Kaye Mughal said: 'It's unbelievable Biscuit still hasn't found a home when he's such a beautiful and fun-loving dog who would fit in perfectly with a family. 

'Every day we hope someone will call us wanting to meet him, but poor Biscuit is constantly rejected and hasn't had any interest. We really thought he'd find a home before Christmas.'

There is no time limit on how long a dog or cat can spend looking for a new home at Battersea, but anything more than a few months is unusual.

'We used to have dogs who stayed for a year,' Ms Cushway said. 'Now, three or four months is a long stay for us.' 

Intake co-ordinator Woody Woodford-Price said he would be having 'more or less' his first Christmas off since he joined Battersea 14 years ago.

When a family decides they can no longer keep a pet at home, Mr Woodford-Price is their first contact at the home.

He deals with at least 1,300 calls a month and says they run the gamut from the heartbreaking to the slightly perplexing. 

'There have been cases where dogs haven't matched the sofa, things like that, they've been different colours. That does happen as well. Or it just doesn't fit in with their lifestyle.

'People do buy these things as fashion accessories, and it's not, of course,' he said.

'For this time of year, some people are looking to rehome their animals because they're going away for Christmas - they've got parties planned and they want to bring their animals in to the home.'

Come January or February, he will be bracing for another wave of puppies and kittens that were given as ill-advised gifts.

'People don't realise how much it's actually going to cost to feed an animal, the time that's involved ... Like children, they have to be fed, kept clean, with fresh water and food and of course medical treatment as well,' he said.

But he is also expecting a surge of people to make the post-holiday decision to open their homes.

Cat rehomer Ms Davies said she is expecting up to 40 cats to be snapped up this weekend alone.

'Most of our cats will fly out of here,' she said.
