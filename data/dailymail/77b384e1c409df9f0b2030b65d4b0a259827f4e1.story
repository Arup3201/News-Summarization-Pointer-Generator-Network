The coastguard later confirmed that all 19 people have been accounted for and are safely back on shore although it is not yet known what their condition is.

The Super Puma helicopter, is operated by Aberdeen-based CHC Helicopters, was carrying an oil crew change.

A statement from CHC Helicopter said: 'We can confirm that there has 
been an incident involving one of our aircraft in the North Sea, 
approximately 32 miles south-west of Shetland.

'Exact details of the incident, which happened at approximately 3.30pm are not yet known.

'The appropriate authorities have been informed and the company's incident management team has been mobilised. Further details will be released when more information becomes available.'

In May all 14 passengers and crew 
members on a Super Puma helicopter were rescued after it ditched about 
30 miles off the coast of Aberdeen.

The helicopter was on a scheduled flight from Aberdeen Airport to a platform in the North Sea at the time.

A year earlier 16 people died when a Super Puma plunged into the sea. Its gearbox failed while carrying the men to Aberdeen.

The Bond-operated aircraft was 
returning from the BP Miller platform when it went down off the 
Aberdeenshire coast on April 1, 2009.

That incident happened about six weeks
after a Bond Super Puma with 18 people on board ditched in the North 
Sea as it approached a production platform owned by BP. Everyone 
survived that accident.
