Jailed: Keith Cavendish-Coulson leaving Chester Crown Court handcuffed to a police officer after pleading guilty to abusing dozens of young boys

A 71-year-old former French teacher who sexually abused dozens of boys at a top boarding school was today jailed for nearly seven years.

Keith Cavendish-Coulson, 71, preyed on the youngsters while working at the Terra Nova School in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire in the early 1970s.

The teacher, who taught in an old-fashioned academic robe and affected a fake public school accent, was caught out and sacked from his job.

But he escaped justice after a cover-up led by the then headmaster.

Today it emerged many of his the former teacher's victims are seeking damages for the abuse endured.  

As Cavendish-Coulson was jailed at Chester Crown Court, lawyers painted a picture of the private preparatory school run with a 'brutal' military-style regime and described as like something out of a Charles Dickens novel. 

But Cavendish-Coulson, then aged 30 to 32, would behave in a more friendly and approachable way than the other masters.

After befriending his victims he would molest them in classrooms, their dormitories and his private quarters, sometimes in the presence of other children, with his activities an open secret among the boys.

But despite complaints he was allowed to leave the school for 'health reasons', and took up other private teaching posts, including offering his services to Eton College, the court heard.

Two separate police investigations in 1998 and 2005 stalled, the court heard.

Past pupils of the £13,000-a-year Terra Nova school include Olympic sailing gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie and David and Victoria Beckham’s eldest son, Brooklyn.

Cavendish-Coulson yesterday admitted 42 offences of indecent assault against 24 boys aged between eight and 13, while working at the school between 1973 and 1975.

He also admitted a further offence of indecent assault against another child while working as a private tutor in the mid-1980s.

Jailing him, Judge Roger Dutton said: 'It is a sad reflection on the attitudes of that time that even when complaints were made by parents no proper action was taken to investigate these grave allegations. That amounted to a shameful and abject failure to deal with serious sexual abuse upon boys.

'One cannot help but conclude that the reputation of the school meant more to those in authority than the exposure of wholesale sexual abuse by a member of staff on their premises.

'It is quite obvious that the impact of the defendant’s behaviour has had a profound effect on them all.'

Paedophile: Cavendish-Coulson leaving Chester Courts in custody in the prison van after sentencing

Earlier, Anne Whyte QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'It is quite clear that this defendant was a persistent and predatory paedophile.'

Boys at the school were separated from their families as boarders so there was 'no escape' from their tormentor, she said.

For each victim it was their first sexual experience, they found it difficult to comprehend what was happening and it left wrecked lives, leaving years of feeling guilt and worthlessness and resentment towards their parents, Miss Whyte told the court.

While the psychological harm had lasted 40 years for some victims, the defendant told probation officers he was abused as a youngster himself and said of his victims, 'Why can’t they get over it?'

Cavendish-Coulson’s abuse was uncovered after the father of one boy overheard his son talking about it and contacted the headmaster, Andrew Keith.

But Mr Keith concluded 'nothing sinister' had occurred, until weeks later the defendant was found in a 'compromising position' while tutoring another boy privately at a nearby house.

Cavendish-Coulson was allowed to resign on health grounds and the real reason covered up, though school governors and doctors were aware of the real situation but did not want to 'stir up trouble unnecessarily'.

The head wrote to one parent that police involvement would do 'untold damage to the school' and the 'quicker we can forgive and forget the better'.

The defendant’s name was however put on 'List 99' by the Department for Education and barred from working in state schools - though not, it appears from working in private schools or as a private tutor.

He faked references and worked as a private tutor in Surrey and for a number of schools until his past was found out.

Jeremy Laskar QC, mitigating for the defendant, said: 'The climate during the 1970s was as far removed from the climate that exists today than can possibly be imagined.

'I do not seek to suggest that what occurred all those years ago was any less reprehensible.

'When one listens to the regime that existed in the school in the 70s it does from today’s perspective, seem rather Victorian.'

Judge Dutton interrupted: 'Dickensian. Dotheboys Hall. Extra-ordinary.

Cavendish-Coulson was known as just Coulson at the school and when and how he acquired his double-barrelled name is unclear.

He was noted for wearing an academic gown while teaching and affecting the manners and accent of an upper-class public schoolboy, claiming to be an old Etonian.

He also had a conviction for fraud after adopting the names of peers of the realm to write out cheques. In fact he was born in Stockport, the son of a post office worker, and went to a local state school.

Today it emerged a number of his victims are seeking damages for the abuse endured. 

Charles Derham, a solicitor representing two of Cavendish-Coulson's victims each seeking £35,000 said: ‘The school allowed Cavendish-Coulson to abuse his position of trust purely for his own sexual gratification. 

‘Matters are compounded by the fact the school even knew what was happening and covered up the situation to protect themselves, when really they should have been protecting the children in their care.

Changes: Martin Hallam, current chairman of governors at Terra Nova School, issued a 'heartfelt' apology

‘Financial compensation is not going to mend the harm that has been done, but any compensation awarded may mean that they can obtain the specialist professional help that they may require.’

Lawyer Hywel Thomas, of Slater & Gordon, who is also representing a number of former pupils, added: ‘For months many of Cavendish-Coulson’s victims believed that they would have to attend court and recount the abuse they had suffered.

‘It is quite possible there are other people who have been abused by Keith Cavendish-Coulson who have not yet come forward. My advice is that they should contact the police as soon as possible.’

Martin Hallam, chairman of governors at Terra Nova, apologised to the former pupils and strongly condemned Cavendish-Coulson’s actions.

He said the school was a very different place today, adding: ‘These offences are abhorrent and deplorable. 

'Our first thoughts are with the victims who will have lived with this dreadful experience for their entire adult lives.

‘The school would in no way condone the ‘covering up’ of any allegations or behaviour that could risk a child’s welfare.

‘Policies on safeguarding are very different these days and much more robust and effective against this type of offence.’
