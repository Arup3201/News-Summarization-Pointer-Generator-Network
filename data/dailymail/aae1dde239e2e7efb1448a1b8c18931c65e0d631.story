Referees are often taunted by angry supporters with the jibe 'you're not fit to referee'. Unfortunately for Phil Dowd on Saturday he literally wasn't.

The official had to be replaced at half-time during West Brom's clash against Southampton after injuring his knee during the first period.

Dowd appeared to be struggling during the opening 45 minutes and it was clear there was a problem when fourth official Graham Scott went through a rigorous warm-up during the break

Scott emerged for the second half, while Dowd was spotted watching from the tunnel after sitting out the rest of the match.

Tony Pulis' side held on to secure an important three points after Saido Berahino had netted the game's only goal in just the second minute.

The win moves West Brom up to 13th, while Southampton lost ground in the race for the top four.
