Zookeepers in Edinburgh could be set to hear the pitter patter of tiny feet soon with the UK's only two giant pandas likely to be ready to breed within the next month.

Experts believe that Tian Tian and Yang Guang, who arrived at Edinburgh Zoo in a blaze of publicity in 2011, could mate within weeks.

The pair are said to have already started showing important changes in their behavour.

Male Yang Guang has been spotted doing handstands against trees, walls and rocks and scent-marking as high up as possible - known as a display of virility in the wild - while Tian Tian has already started calling out to him - a common sign during breeding season.

Zookeepers can usually tell when pandas are likely to mate through a combination of behavourial observation and hormone testing.

But no hormonal changes have been seen in either panda as yet.

Edinburgh Zoo - where the pandas have lived since their arrival from China in December 2011 - has employed a number of measures to synchronise the breeding cycles of the pandas, including controlled lighting, urine testing for hormone levels and enclosure swapping.

They were first introduced to each other last April but did not end up fully mating.

Female pandas are in season for less than 48 hours.

Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas and strategic innovations for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: 'We're delighted that both Tian Tian and Yang Guang have started to scent mark and call, both clear behavioural indicators of courtship and mating behaviour.

'Although both giant pandas are showing these changes in their behaviour, it is still early days yet and way too early to give any accurate prediction on timings, however, early indicators do suggest the breeding season will probably fall in March this year.

'In reality we could be as little as four weeks away, although equally the big day could still be as far off as eight weeks.

'This year we will combine both natural and assisted reproduction methods.

'This follows the best practice methodology adopted by other panda-keeping zoos around the world and gives our giant pandas the best possible chance of success.'

Celebrities: The two pandas arrived at the zoo in a fanfare of celebration from China in December 2011

The pair arrived at Edinburgh Zoo amid much excitement in December 2011.

During their first year at the zoo, Tian Tian, meaning 'Sweetie', and Yang Guang, which means 'Sunshine', brought in half a million visitors and an extra Â£3million revenue.

They will stay in Edinburgh for at least another nine years.

Ready to mate: Tian Tian

Although pandas are generally thought of as poor breeders, that is a mistaken theory based on animals in captivity.

Experts say that wild pandas have a reproduction rate similar to the American black bear which is thriving.

Giant pandas reach sexual maturity at between five-and-a-half and six-and-a-half years old.

A female can mate with several males who compete with one another to mate with her while a male panda will seek out different females who are on heat.

The mating season for giant pandas generally falls between March and May but a female is in season for less than 48 hours.

Males and females normally only associate for between two and four days and the female is pregnant for between 95 and 160 days.

Pandas normally give birth to a single baby, but multiple births are possible if artificial insemination is used in captivity.

They produce offspring roughly once every two years.
