Rejected: Former Lostprophets singer and convicted paedophile Ian Watkins has had his appeal bid against his sentence turned down

Former Lostprophets singer and convicted paedophile Ian Watkins has had his appeal bid against his sentence turned down, despite arguing his sex crimes were 'not the worst'.

The 37-year-old singer's defence lawyer had told Court of Appeal judges sitting at Cardiff Crown Court that Watkins had been unfairly treated when he was given a 29 year jail term.

The 13 sex offences he pleaded guilty 
to last November included the attempted rape of an 11-month old child as well as 
encouraging a fan to abuse her baby via webcam.

Police also found a stash of child porn videos - some of which he had made himself.

Originally, Watkins had pleaded his innocence to a string of offences - despite a damning video evidence.

He
 changed his plea at the last minute - averting a trial - but then 
complained he had not realised that his guilty plea had made him 'look 
guilty'.

While awaiting 
sentencing last December, he was recorded by prison officials saying the whole thing 
was 'megalolz' during a telephone call to a friend.

Although 37-year-old Watkins did not 
challenge his 13 sex offence convictions, the disgraced rock star 
complained he was treated too harshly by sentencing judge Mr Justice 
Royce when he was handed a 29 year jail term as well as an additional six years on licence.

As he sentenced the singer, the judge called him a dangerous sexual predator and told the now grey haired Watkins: 'The public and, in particular, young females need protection from you.'

Sally O'Neil QC told the court that Watkins had spared witnesses and jury members from taking part in what would have been a 'distressing' trial, but had not been given enough credit for his guilty plea.

She said: 'This case causes a very 
disturbing reaction for anyone who has has anything to do with it. We 
accept these matters are very serious.

Argument: Sally O'Neil QC had argued on Watkins's behalf that he had not been given enough benefit for pleading guilty

'But by pleading guilty my client 
averted the need for a most distressing and unpleasant trial for all 
those concerned, especially a jury.

'He did not have to plead guilty and if he had done so the consequences would have been shocking.

'I
 am not trying to minimise the gravity of these offences, just simply 
make the observation that a sense of proportion needs to be maintained.

'These offences, however bad, are not the worst.'

However, the appeal judges failed to be swayed by the argument and ruled they would not grant leave for appeal.

Watkins' two female accomplices, who can only be referred to as Woman A and Woman B for legal reasons, were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively.

Woman B also had her appeal bid turned down.

Hearing: Court of Appeal judges (left - right) Mr Justice Griffith Williams, Lord Justice Pitchford and Mrs Justice Simler turned down his appeal and said his 29 year jail term had been appropriate

'Shocking': Lord Justice Pitchford said that Watkins's offences had been of 'shocking depravity', and required a lengthy prison sentence

But Lord Justice Pitchford said the sentences handed to Watkins and his female accomplice were appropriate.

Although
 a full judgment will be handed down in writing next week, Lord 
Pitchford said: 'These offences against children were of shocking 
depravity...a very lengthy prison sentence was demanded.'

The
 Court of Appeal also said Watkins did not demonstrate that his 29 year 
prison sentence was “not unduly manifestly excessive” and the sentencing
 judge had “reached the appropriate conclusion”.

Watkins was not present at the hearing and also chose not to appear from HMP Long Lartin via video link.
