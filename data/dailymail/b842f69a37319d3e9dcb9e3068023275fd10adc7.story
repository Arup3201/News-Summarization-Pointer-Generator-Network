Runaway grapes have been blamed for two of the three women suing Woolworths after slipping over on the floors at three of the supermarket chain’s stores in Queensland.

Following Andrea Downie filing a $320,000 claim last month alleging she slipped on a grape and injured her back last year at the Tewantan store, another two women are now claiming for injuries.

The two most recent claims, filed by Turner Freeman Lawyers in Ipswich on September 3, said Woolworths failed to keep the supermarket floors clean, Channel Nine reported. 

Redbank Plains resident Melissa Ann Haidle, 32, claims also she slipped on a grape as she walked down the bread aisle at Plainland on March 10 last year, causing her to fall backwards and injure her right knee.

Her claim covers past and future loss of income from earnings and medical expenses.

While Ipswich woman Silvana Jevtic says she slipped on a 'green leafy substance' on the floor opposite the ice machines at the Yamanto Shopping Centre on March 31, 2012.

Ms Jevtic alleged as she began to fall, her right foot jarred while she was holding onto her shopping trolley and her body twisted forcefully.

Ms Jevtic 's District Court claim said although she did not hit the floor, she still injured her lower back.

Daily Mail Australia is yet to have heard back from Woolworths about the two most recent claims.

Andrea Downie says she slipped on a grape while shopping and can no longer work

This comes as Ms Downie claims the fall injured her back and caused an existing condition of post-traumatic stress disorder to flare up, meaning she could not return to work, reported the Courier Mail.

Ms Downie is suing Woolworths claiming that the supermarket failed to keeps its floors clean.

She also claims the grape was 'in clear view' of staff and that the supermarket chain failed to have an 'adequate system of inspecting floors'.

Ms Downie claimed Woolworths staff failed to be alert to hazards and spills, or warn her about loose grapes on the floor.

She also said Woolworths should place mats on the floor of the produce section to stop loose grapes from 'escaping' onto the floor.

Woolworths defended itself against the claims saying that Ms Downie did not complain to staff about the fall when it occurred and that it is 'uncertain' of the truth of her claim.

Ms Downie allegedly slipped wile shopping at the Tewantin story. The company says it is 'uncertain' if Ms Downie really did slip and fall, but if she did the damages she is claiming are 'excessive'

'If the fall occurred as alleged by [Ms Downie], it was not reported to anyone at Woolworths on the day,' the company states in its defence, reported the Courier Mail.

Woolworths stated that if the incident did occur, the damages claimed by Ms Downie were 'grossly excessive and unreasonable' and any loss of income results from her pre-existing physical and psychiatric conditions.

Woolworths offered to settle the case in April and the case will go to trial on November 17.

Woolworths declined to comment further on the matter.

Lawyer Sam Macedone told Today that the case was 'very interesting' because the incident was reported after the event.

He advised anyone involved in a slip-and-fall incident to report the accident to management immediately.

'If you fall over and you believe it’s their fault, you’ve slipped on something that’s on the floor, make a report of it straight away… Make sure it's on the record,' he said.
