Former Russian spy Anna Chapman has proposed marriage to NSA
leaker on the lam Edward Snowden via Twitter.

The flame-haired femme fatale was short and sweet: ‘Snowden,
will you marry me?!’

The tweet came just as the world began to wonder if Edward
Snowden was still in Chapman’s country of Russia—where he’s been holed up in a
Moscow airport for days—or if he’d managed to sneak aboard the flight of
Bolivian President Evo Morales headed for South America.

Perfectly matched: Russian spy turned fashionista Anna Chapman has asked NSA leaker Ed Snowden to marry her, via a tweet Wednesday

Latin America, specifically Venezuala, is thought to be
Snowden’s last hope for asylum after withdrawing his petition to Russia
Tuesday.

Since her own espionage controversy—along with nine others
accused of spying in 2010—Chapman has led a busy life.

She was immediately catapulted into the limelight as her
pictures were splashed around the world.

The daughter of a senior KGB agent has become a celebrity in
Russia since she returned in the summer of 2010.

Ladies man: 'I like my girlish figure that attracts girls,' a younger Snowden once wrote. That figure attracted a pole-dancing lady friend in Hawaii named Lindsay Mills

She has previously appeared on the catwalk at Russian
Fashion Week in Moscow clothed in a skin-tight leather ensemble.

She has also modeled, edited a magazine, given lectures and
now runs a foundation.

Last year she appeared on the catwalk in the Mediterranean city
of Antalya, a top Turkish vacation destination.

The controversial temptress has made many tongues wag since
her name was first splashed across the front page of magazines and websites
worldwide.

But Snowden, at least in his pre-international controversy
days, claims to have elicited some leering himself.

His type? Lindsay Mills was Edward Snowden's girlfriend before he fled U.S. authorities. She bears some resemblance to Anna Chapman

Similar: Chapman looked not unlike Snowden's heartbroken ex Lindsay Mills on a Moscow red carpet recently. Now she may be after him herself

'I like my girlish figure that attracts girls,' he wrote as
an 18-year-old.

That figure later won Snowden an attractive pole-dancing
lady friend in Hawaii, Lindsay Mills.

And though Mills may not be a globetrotting diplomat’s
daughter, if you look at her in just the right light she does resemble Chapman.

Hopefully for Anna, that means she’s Snowden’s type.
