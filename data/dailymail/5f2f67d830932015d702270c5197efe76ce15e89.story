Live in Illinois and wondering who's got the most cash in your state? Try billionaire Ken Griffin. In California? Then Larry Ellison's your man.

The real estate blog Movoto has collected wealth data from Forbes and Celebrity Net Worth to make a map highlighting the richest person in each U.S. state.

The map can be read by looking for darker shades of blue for those at the richest end of the spectrum, and darker shades of red representing the lower end.

Microsoft man Bill Gates topped the list - and the world - with his massive computer fortune

According to that data, the wealthiest tend to fall into three categories: Entrepreneurs, Heirs, and Widows.

About half of those on the list are founders of their own companies.

As The Huffington Post noticed, there can be huge gaps between fortunes.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffet, the Oracle of Omaha, came in second place on the list

Bill Gates tops the list for richest man in Washington, along with the country and the world since the Microsoft founder's company netted him a whopping $76 billion net worth.

Gate's inclusion highlights that academics may not always be as important as people think, as the computer innovator is a college dropout.

Delaware's Robert Gore earned a Ph. D., but is second to last on the list for net worth.

Rob Walton, Alice Walton, and Jim Walton, dominated three states with their inheritance from the Wal-Mart empire

Rounding 
out the top five are Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffet at $65.1 billion, 
brothers Charles Koch and David Koch at $52 billion each in Kansas and 
New York, and Larry Ellison in California at $44.9 billion.

The least richest person on the map is 
Robert Gillam, who's Alaska-based institutional investment firm barely 
squeaks him onto the list with a paltry $700 million.

The Walton family dominated the list in three states, with Wal-Mart heirs Jim Walton topping Arkansas with $35.7 billion, Alice Walton taking Texas with $35.3 billion, and Christy Walton leading Wyoming at $37.9 billion.
