New DNA tests on a knife allegedly used to murder British student Meredith Kercher show traces of Amanda Knox but crucially none of the victim, a leaked copy of the report has revealed.

The court-ordered findings will be revealed in full next week, when the retrial resumes against 26-year-old Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29. It is already being seen by both defense teams as a boost to their cases.

As has been typical of the high-profile case, details have been leaked and they reveal that traces of Knox's DNA are on the 30cm kitchen knife, believed to be the murder weapon, but significantly there is no trace of Miss Kercher.

British student Meredith Kercher was brutally murdered six years ago on Friday while she was studying in Perugia, Italy. Questions still remain over her death

At the original hearing against Knox and Sollecito, the court was told how Knox's DNA was found on the handle and Miss Kercher's DNA on the blade.

However a subsequent hearing ruled DNA traces of the victim were so small they were inconclusive.

The knife had originally been seized from Sollecito's home in Perugia, Italy, where 20-year-old Miss Kercher was found brutally murdered six years ago this Friday.

Knox and Sollecito were originally found guilty of the murder at an initial trial in 2009 but dramatically cleared two years later.

Earlier this year, Italy's Supreme Court ordered a fresh trial which began last month.

Forensic experts from the paramilitary Carabinieri carried out new tests at their headquarters in Rome and deposited their 'secret' report at the court in Florence.

The report says that DNA traces from Knox have been found on the knife in the area where the 'blade joins the handle' but no trace of Miss Kercher or Sollecito.Â

Knox's lawyer, Luciano Ghirga,  said: 'These results once again underline the distance between my client and the murder of Meredith Kercher. This shows that the court was right to dismiss this evidence when the pair were cleared of murder in 2011.

'It once again underlines that this knife is not the murder weapon and the investigators have worked well in difficult circumstances as the amount of DNA on the knife is very, very small.'

Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, said: 'This proves that all Amanda Knox did with that knife is pull it from a drawer in my client's kitchen and simply use it for cooking. There is no trace of Meredith on that knife as we clearly proved at the second hearing.'

Francesco Maresca, who represents the Kercher family from Coulsdon, Surrey, said: 'This shows that Knox used the knife and put together with the other elements, enables us to pursue the responsibility of those accused.'

He added: 'The earlier hearings were told how DNA from Meredith was found on the tip and we will be arguing this point when the trial resumes.'

Meanwhile prison guard Raffaele Argiro, who Knox accused of sexually harassing her, has been ordered to stand trial for abusing another female inmate at Perugia's Capanne Prison where she was held.

Knox said that Argiro would call her to his office and question her about sexual experiences and that he would always attend her prison medical examinations.

His trial for abusing an unidentified Milanese traffic warden who was briefly held in the jail is due to start later this month and he denies any wrongdoing in both cases.
