Eastern promise: Despite her Scandinavian roots, Anna Soderstom lead the Oxford University Middle Eastern Dance Society

When Monty Python star Terry Jones married Anna Soderstrom last year, only their four-year-old daughter Siri and two neighbours were in attendance at the ceremony in north London.

None of his friends, family or children from his first marriage - and none of his famous colleagues from the Monty Python troupe, which has just publicly announced its reunion amid smiles and hugs.

Terry revealed this week that the secret wedding took place just months after the finalisation of his divorce from Alison Telfer, his wife of 42 years.

Terry claimed he and Alison were in an open marriage when he met Anna at a book signing in Oxford in 2005, where - as a 23-year-old - she was doing a degree in modern languages.

But it didn't take long for Jones's marriage to hit the buffers.

Apart from the facts that Jones reveals - he told The Sun about the secret wedding, for example, and the fact that the day was not celebrated by fellow Pythons John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle or Terry Gilliam - very little is known about his young bride.

It sounds like the sort of eclectic description that Jones himself would write for one of his sketches. His wife was born in Sweden, studied at Oxford, and enjoys a spot of belly dancing.

Famously, Soderstrom was photographed with a belly-dancing troupe at the Jericho Tavern in Oxford a year after the couple met.

She was reported to have joined the 
Oxford University Middle Eastern Dance Society because Jones likes to role play and wanted to spice up their love life.

The
 brunette arrived from Stockholm in 2002 
to study modern languages at Oxford's Hertford College, where Terry also
 gained his degree before embarking on his comedy career.

Jones was doing a book signing when he met Anna in 2005 and the pair began dating.

Described
 as 'quiet and unassuming', she is, at first glance, not a traditional 
siren and was apparently something of a reticent figure at college.

Jones was taking part in a book signing when he met Anna, then 23, in 2005 and the pair began dating. They married in secret last year

One
 contemporary told the Daily Mail in 2005: 'If anything, she fancies 
herself as something of an intellectual and keeps herself to herself. 
She is not an obvious sex symbol.’

She
 was said to be an 'avid fan' of Monty Python. On hearing that Jones was
 to attend a book signing at the Oxford bookshop Blackwells she decided 
to go along.

According 
to one source, she introduced herself to Jones and they enjoyed an 
impromptu chat which continued over drinks and dinner.

First wife: Jones with Alison Telfer at London's Institut Francaise in 1998. They were married in 1970 and rem,ained married even after Jones fathered Soderstrom's child

In 1995 Jones, from Colwyn Bay, North 
Wales, had revealed he had an open marriage with Biochemist wife Alison 
Telfer, claiming they both had lovers without it affecting their 
relationship.

Telfer was said to be furious over the admission, believing their private life should remain exactly that.

When she learned of the affair with 
Anna, who is a decade younger than Terry's own daughter - one of two 
children he fathered with Alison - she asked Jones to leave the marital 
home in Camberwell, south London. He spent Christmas with 
Soderstrom in the home they now share in Highgate, north London.

The couple have been together ever since.

Anna’s
 father Torbjorn Soderstrom, 55, a surgeon, supports the relationship. 
He said: ‘I’ve never been against it in any sort of way.

Anna, seen smiling for the camera on a family holiday, came to England in 2002 to study at Oxford

Anna's difficult pregnancy with Siri encouraged her to start knitting

‘I’m very fond of Terry. I’ve been a Monty Python fan since I was a kid. I have no opinion on the age difference. Relationships are not about that.’

In 2009, Anna gave birth to the couple’s only child, daughter Siri.

While pregnant Anna took up knitting, enjoying it so much that she started a business selling handmade luxury scarfs, blankets and hats.

The company, named after Anna, operates out of a north London studio and uses high-quality British wool, as well as alpaca and cashmere.

Talking to the Ham And High newspaper about her venture, Anna, who had been working as a script supervisor for Terry before she fell pregnant, said : ‘I was very ill during my pregnancy and had terrible morning sickness.

‘I was debilitated really. I couldn’t even read it was that bad.

‘One day my mother gave me some knitting needles to help pass the time. I discovered I could do it and spent the whole pregnancy knitting.

‘We [she and Terry] were living and working together at that time, which was actually not bad at all – it was a great collaboration. But I always thought I wanted to do something for myself, rather than just play a supporting role for my husband.’

Tickets to the Monty Python reunion show sold out in less than a minute after going on sale on Monday morning.

The urviving members of the veteran comedy troupe announced they were getting back together last
 week.

A spokesman for the 
Pythons said the July 1 event at London's O2 Arena sold out in 43.5 
seconds, with tickets for four further shows then immediately going on 
sale.

The concerts at the venue in Greenwich, south east London, come more than 30 years after their last stage performance.

Speaking
 at last week's press conference, they said they would include some of 
their most famous routines including the dead parrot sketch.

Return: The surviving members of the Python comedy group, from left, Palin, Idle, Jones, Gilliam and John Cleese quickly added four more dates

Idle said fans could 'expect a little comedy, a lot of pathos, some music and a tiny bit of ancient sex'.

Speaking
 on The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Cleese said: 'If we can add some 
shows we will but it will entirely depend on if the tickets sell. We 
always say that when we get together, we laugh more than at any other 
time in our lives so it's kind of fun.'

Their last major live show was at the Hollywood Bowl in 1982.

Cleese
 added: 'We have to be very careful about doing new stuff. It's not a 
theatrical presentation, it's like a rock concert and when people go to 
rock concerts they want to hear the old songs and they're actually 
literally disappointed if you do new material.'

We're back: At a press conference last week at the Corinthia Hotel, the group posed with Carol Cleveland

The Pythons amassed millions of
 fans for their groundbreaking, anarchic comedy series and films, which 
also launched their own successful solo careers.

Monty
 Python's Flying Circus was made for TV between 1969 and 1974 and 
generations of fans can recite lines and whole sketches. The team went 
on to make films including Monty Python And The Holy Grail (1975) and 
Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979).

Sixth
 Python Graham Chapman died of cancer in 1989 aged just 48, and nine 
years later the five remaining members shared a stage at the Aspen 
Comedy Festival in the US.

They said they would miss performing with Chapman but he would have a presence on-screen during the show.

Idle said: 'We've told him we're going on and, if there is a God, he'll be turning up.'

The event will be filmed and 'we will try and flog it later', he added.
