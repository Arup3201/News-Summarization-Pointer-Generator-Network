Floyd Mayweather Jnr began his official training camp at his Las Vegas gym on Monday as he prepares to take on Manny Pacquiao in May.

The undefeated world welterweight champion posted several pictures to the social media site shots.com on Monday night and also uploaded a video to Instagram after his first session - which took place on the same day Pacquiao started training at Freddie Roach's Wild Card gym in Los Angeles.

The pair will come face-to-face next week for the only time before the week of their £160million mega-fight.

Having finally agreed terms to clash in Las Vegas on May 2, the rivals will hold just one press conference, in downtown Los Angeles on March 11. 

It's the fight everyone wants to watch and Hollywood stars Nicolas Cage and Elijah Wood dropped by, giving Mayweather the chance to post another picture.

'I appreciate you Nicolas Cage for coming by my gym today,' was the message Mayweather posted with the picture.

Mayweather also uploaded a video to Instagram of him punching a speed ball

Filipino star Pacquiao posted a video of himself jogging after he had flown in from his homeland over the weekend.

Pacquiao must do without legendary trainer Roach until next week as the 54-year-old is preparing for Zou Shiming's first world title fight  against Amnat Ruenroeng in Macao on Saturday.

But when he returns, Roach will shut down his gym to work on the game plan he has devised.

'I won't tell you what the game plan is because that will be very silent,' he told the South China Morning Post. 'The whole Wildcard Gym [in Los Angeles, where Pacquiao is training] will be shut down and we will work out Manny's best strategy and nobody will watch it.'

Mayweather will work with his father and uncle and has already booked the services of former opponent DeMarcus Corley as a sparring partner, according to Fight Hype. 

Corley troubled Mayweather in their 2004 fight but was knocked down twice before losing a unanimous decision.

Mayweather and Pacquiao had not met before they went to the same basketball match in Miami earlier this year.

Having exchanged numbers, they later met in Pacquiao's hotel suite to thrash out the details but an official announcement was not made for several weeks.
