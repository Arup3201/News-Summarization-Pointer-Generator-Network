Texas, Louisiana and the upper-Midwest are brimming with native-born residents, while Florida, Nevada and Arizona are full of blow-ins.Â 

That's according to a new map created by Vizual Statistix Tumblr  number cruncher Seth Kadish using Census data.

The redder a U.S. county, the more likely that residents were born in that state. The whiter the area, the more likely that residents had relocated.

Demographics: This map shows the areas with a high concentration of original inhabitants (red) and those brimming with people from somewhere else (white)

The map also shows that the western part of the country is lighter than the eastern side, suggesting more people migrate west than the other way around.

Given the strong influence of population density, Kadish created a second map that shows the percentage of people living
in each county who were born in the state in which they live.

Of the 24 counties with more than 90 per cent of 
residents living in their birth states, 11 are in Mississippi (four) and
Louisiana (seven).

Of the 25 counties with fewer than 25 per cent of residents 
living in their birth states, five are in Alaska (not shown), five are 
in Florida, and four are in Nevada.

Kadish said there is a 'three in five chance' of meeting someone in your U.S. state who was born there.

Kadish was inspired to crunch the numbers after noticing most of his friends had relocated from other states.

'As
a native Portlander who is now living once again in Portland, I find 
that fewer and fewer of my peers were born in Oregon,' he wrote on his Tumblr.

'Most of my friends
living here are from other states.

'To investigate whether this was a coincidence or a reflection of a real trend, I decided to map the Census data on the topic.

'My suspicions about Portland were justified: in Multnomah 
County, only 43% of residents were born in Oregon, which is well below 
the national average!'
