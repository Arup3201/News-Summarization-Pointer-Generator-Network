Marcos Rojo is hopeful of a quick return to Manchester United's defence and admits it has been frustrating to miss so many matches through injury.

The summer signing from Sporting Lisbon has not featured since picking up a thigh injury following United's 2-1 win at Southampton on December 8 and has since missed four games, against Liverpool, Aston Villa, Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur.

During an interview for United Review, Rojo - who was also injured earlier in the season against Manchester City - explained: 'It's something you never want to go through. You always want to be out there playing on the field, helping your team-mates.

'I've had the misfortune to get injured recently and I really don't like it. It's terrible to miss training and be out of the team. I just hope I can regain my full fitness quickly and it doesn't happen again, as it's never good being injured.'

United's next match is against Stoke City on New Year's Day, a fixture swiftly followed by a trip to Yeovil Town in the FA Cup third round. After missing so many games through injury, Rojo is looking forward to coming back at the start of 2015.

'Certainly there are a lot of games coming quickly, one after another,' said Rojo. 'That's what I want, to get fit as quickly as possible so I can lend a hand to the team. The manager is going to want as many players as possible for this busy period. It's an important part of the season with so many games in quick succession.'
