Plot: Dominic Di Chiera, 50, ordered thousands of pounds of expensive equipment on BBC accounts to embarrass his boss

A BBC technical operations manager used the corporation’s account to order nearly £8,000 worth of specialist electrical equipment during an act of 'revenge' against his manager after his contract was terminated.

Former BBC News team leader Dominic Di Chiera, 50, sought to blow his boss’s budget to embarrass him at a time of severe staff cuts after finding out his contract wasn't being renewed.

But his spending spree was picked up by his manager who tracked the orders back to Di Chiera who was then arrested.

Australian-born Di Chiera pleaded guilty
to seven counts of fraud by false representation, namely fraudulently 
using a BBC account to make purchase orders totalling £7,773.63 between
June 4 and 26.

Di Chiera, who joined the beeb in January last year after fourteen years at Channel 4, was sentenced yesterday to a twelve-month community order with 200 hours community service work.

He was also ordered to pay £1,000 compensation to the BBC.

Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court heard how Di Chiera ordered a 3D Blu-ray player, LED televisions, a mobile phone, camera drive and other electrical items after finding out his contract wouldn't be renewed.

Four items were recovered by police when they searched his matrimonial home in Battersea, London, but the court heard he hid the rest around the BBC building.

Prosecutor Miss Louise Burnell told the court: 'Di Chiera was making fraudulent purchase orders for electrical equipment using the BBC account and having many of the items delivered to his home address.'

The court heard how his manager, Huw Davies, noticed a suspicious order made on the BBC account just days before Di Chiera's contract was due to terminate on June 30.

Caught out: Di Chiera's manager spotted a 'suspicious order' on the accounts and tracked it back to him

'It was reported to an investigating 
manager and the purchase order history revealed Mr Di Chiera had used 
the account on behalf of the BBC and many orders were delivered to his 
home address.'

The court was told Di Chiera admitted the items had been delivered to his home and blamed the stress of his contract coming to an end for his 'silly' actions.

The police were called and Di Chiera’s home was searched the same day and he was later questioned by officers.

'He said he had hidden many of the items within the BBC, but it is a mammoth task to search the building for them and the items have not been recovered.'

Di Chiera told the probation service Mr Davies had put him under huge pressure and he was working sixteen-hour days at the BBC.

He felt whatever he did was not sufficient to satisfy management and said the frauds were an act of 'revenge' to make his boss look bad by going over budget.

Di Chiera’s lawyer Juleun Lim told the court: 'None of these items were retained by him. He’s ordered them and they have been put back into circulation in the BBC stock.

'His motivation was to effect negatively his manager over the budget and make him look bad so that when the budget was reviewed there would be an overspend.

'His manager was treating him very unfairly and putting a tremendous amount of pressure on him and he likens it to being bullied.

'His work was good and when he was told his contract would not be renewed the pressure got to him and to use his words: "I suffered a mental breakdown."

'He is sorry he acted in the way that he did and he does wish to make amends.

'He is unemployed and actively seeking work in the same field.'

Di Chiera was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

He was employed at a variety of BBC sites and has also worked for Channel 4 and BSkyB.
