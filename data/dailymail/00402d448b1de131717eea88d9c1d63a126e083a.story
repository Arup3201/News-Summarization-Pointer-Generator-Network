Dogs are known as man's best friend, but they make sure to look out for their fellow canines as well.

A tiny dachshund named Razor helped alert a passersby in Belen, New Mexico, to the fact that his 180lb friend Jazzy, a St Bernard, was stuck two feet in the mud.

Owner Tim Chavez believes that the nine-year-old large dog was stuck in a muddy irrigation ditch for 18 hours after she ran away from home, according to KRQE.

Razor began barking wildly last Monday morning, the day after his larger pal left.

The tiny dog then took off across a field towards Jazzy in the ditch.

A passer-by driving on the road adjacent to the ditch heard the barking, looked down and saw Razor next to the immobilized Jazzy.

Jazzy was then taken out of the mud by eight rescue workers who used backboard straps and a spine board.

Belen Fire and Rescue's Manny Garcia said that the dogs hind legs were submerged and she was unable to move, according to KOAT. 

Razor's heroics have earned her local fame, and the city council plans to honor the dog with a certificate at the beginning of March. 

'It really means a lot. You don’t really realize how attached you are to your pets until something like this happens,” Mr Chavez said 

The dog lover's pitbull Layla also ran away from home last Sunday and is still missing.
