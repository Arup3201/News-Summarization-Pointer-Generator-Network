A man who was charged over a hijack scare on a Virgin flight from Brisbane to Bali has been found not guilty of interfering with a crew member.

Matt Christopher Lockley, 28, triggered the airline's hijack procedure in April when he allegedly bashed on the cockpit door and demanded entry.

He pleaded not guilty to interfering with a crew member in October, arguing he was trying to get into the toilet and was confused because he was having a panic attack.

The Brisbane Magistrates Court previously heard Lockley was paranoid someone had interfered with his luggage.

Magistrate Judith Daley on Friday found Lockley not guilty of interfering with the crew and accepted that he was suffering from an undetermined medical condition. 

Lockley said he 'definitely had a panic attack'.  

'I am very relieved ... I never tried to get in anywhere, it was a big misunderstanding,' he told reporters outside court. 

Flight attendants have testified that about four hours into the flight Lockley complained that other passengers had tampered with his bag and that he was being followed.

Attendant Angela Demo said he asked her to get rid of two zip-locked bags containing vitamin bottles and toiletries.

He had feared other passengers had tampered with his bag and said he knew 'the ramifications of entering Indonesia with illicit drugs'.

Lockley allegedly complained of feeling claustrophobic, and said he had 'perhaps watched too many movies and he'd had a drink the night before', flight attendant Abigail Tilley said.

Ms Demo said Lockley's eyes were dilated and he seemed nervous and possibly under the influence of drugs.

The court heard a woman began suffering a suspected heart attack about five hours into the flight.

Lockley allegedly offered to perform CPR and said he had a first aid certificate.

Flight attendant Jenni Manning told the court she had to leave the semi-conscious patient to get oxygen for her because other cabin crew were busy dealing with Lockley.

About half an hour later, he was seen pounding loudly on the cockpit door, rattling the handle and saying, 'Let me in'.

Ms Demo said when Lockley refused to stop she activated Virgin's hijack procedure drill by giving a verbal code to the flight deck.

'I was frightened,' she said.

'I came across as feeling threatened and felt that he was being aggressive.'

The trial continues.
