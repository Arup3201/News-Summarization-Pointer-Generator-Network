Police officers pepper sprayed a black teenager in his white foster parents' home after they mistook him for a burglar, authorities have said.

Cops responded to the home in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina after a neighbor saw 18-year-old DeShawn Currie entering his family's home through an unlocked side door.

The teenager, who moved in with the Tyler family a year ago, said he was stunned when three police officers entered the home and demanded to know who he was.

'They was like, "Put your hands on the door",' DeShawn told WTVD. 'I was like, "For what? This is my house." I was like, "Why are y'all in here?"'

Hurt: DeShawn Currie, 18, said police officers profiled him when they thought he was a burglar in his white foster parents' house. He said he became angry when they told him he wasn't part of the family

The police officers demanded his ID - which showed a different address - and refused to believe he was part of the family because he was not in any of the pictures on the mantelpiece in the home.

Police said they used pepper spray on the teenager when he 'became profane, threatening and belligerent' and 'refused to follow instructions' from officers.

Stacy Tyler, DeShawn's foster mother, arrived back home to find the police officers there and told them that the teenager was her foster son.

Mrs Tyler and her husband, Ricky Tyler, have three other young children.

'He's my baby boy just as much as my other three children are,' Stacy told WTVD of DeShawn.

Saddened: His foster parents, Ricky and Stacy Tyler, said they thought of DeShawn as their own son

Part of the family: Cops demanded to know why DeShawn, who joined the family last year, was not in any photos on the mantelpiece if he claimed to be part of the family. It caused him to get angry, he said

The family moved into their new home in July and don't know all their neighbors, the Tylers said.

But they were hurt that someone had assumed DeShawn was up to no good - and the teenager said the incident had made him feel less comfortable.

'I had moved into my room, and I'm feeling like I'm loved,' he said. 'Then when they come in and they just profile me and say that I'm not who I am - and that I do not stay here because there was white kids on the wall. That really made me mad.' 

Police said there had been a spate of crimes in the area recently, but did not specifically say how many or what kind.  

Scene: The family moved into this home in July and they do not know all their neighbors yet, they said. One neighbor called 911 after seeing DeShawn enter the home and assumed that he was a burglar

A police spokeswoman did not respond when asked specifically about what instructions Currie did not follow.

Police also have not said how many officers entered the home, their length of service with the department or their race.

Currie was treated by medical personnel at the scene, police said. No charges were filed.
