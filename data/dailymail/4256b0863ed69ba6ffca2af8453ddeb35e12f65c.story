A grandfather died after doctors failed to diagnose his treatable lung cancer for two years.

In May 2010, father-of-two Frank Golby, 65, had a CT scan that should have showed he was suffering from the early stages of lung cancer.

However, staff at University Hospital Coventry told the former Rolls Royce worker that he was just suffering from a chest infection.

Mr Golby then continued to battle persistent pain for almost two years, coughing up blood and becoming anaemic, until he was rushed to hospital with breathing difficulties in February 2012.

In A&E he was given a chest X-ray which revealed the tumour had grown to five times its original size.

At this point, the doctors suspected that he was suffering from lung cancer but before they were able to act on their findings, or inform his family, Mr Golby died.

The hospital has now admitted misdiagnosing Mr Golby, and accepts that early diagnosis could have prolonged his life by ten years, but his angry family have said it is all 'too little too late'.

His son, Mark Golby, said: ‘My father put his complete trust in the doctors who treated him and had confidence that they were doing everything they could to help him.

‘He never discovered that the doctors had completely missed his cancer.

Two years before he died, Mr Golby (pictured with his grandson), had a CT scan which should have told doctors that he had early stage lung cancer but he was told he just had a chest infection

‘Looking back it's hard to believe the doctors missed the warning signs that something was seriously wrong.

‘He had been coughing up blood for months and still they did not think to check for cancer.’

Neil Clayton, a lawyer at medical negligence specialists Lime Solicitors, said: ‘An independent medical expert concluded that if clinicians had reviewed the CT scan taken in 2010, the one centimetre nodule on Frank's upper left lung would have been clearly visible and would in turn have indicated he was suffering from the early stages of lung cancer.

His son, Mark, is now urging other people to seek a second opinion if they are worried about their symptoms

‘At this point, the cancer was highly treatable and a combination of surgery and either radiotherapy or chemotherapy could in all likelihood have extended his lifespan by around ten years.’

Mark Golby said: ‘By the time he was admitted to hospital his breathing had become very laboured.

‘Even then we believed the doctors' diagnosis that he just had a chest infection and clung to the hope that it was a passing illness that he would get over.

‘The fact he was such a proud man who didn't like to complain, meant opportunities to make him comfortable were also missed.

‘The hospital had reassured my sister that there was no need for the family to dash up to see him as he was stable and would hopefully be home within a couple of days. Sadly he died the following morning.’

Following a full admission of liability, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, has offered a full apology to Mr Golby’s family and has paid a five figure out of court settlement.

Mark Golby said: ‘Although sadly it's too late for our family, I would urge others to seek a second opinion if they find that their condition fails to improve.

‘No one wants a doctor to tell them they have cancer, but in dad's case, hearing those words two years earlier, when the scan was first taken, could have given him ten more precious years with his family.’

Frank, who worked at the Rolls Royce plant in Coventry for more than 30 years, leaves behind his wife Sandra, aged 62, a son and daughter as well as two grandchildren.

University Hospital Coventry has apologised to Mr Golby's family and have paid compensation

Meghana Pandit, Chief Medical Officer at the trust said: ‘I would like to apologise to Mr Golby’s wife and his family that his cancer was not recognised when his scan was read.

‘While errors of this kind are extremely rare, it doesn’t detract from the pain and distress this has caused. 

‘We have reviewed how the mistake was made and have tried to learn lessons from it. 

‘We hope that the financial settlement can help in some way but we recognise it will never compensate Mr Golby’s family for their loss.’
