The Food and Drug Administration is warning patients about a
potential mix-up between powerful prescription pain drugs and common
over-the-counter medications like Excedrin and Gas-X made at a Novartis
manufacturing plant.

The problem is a result of major manufacturing problems at a
Lincoln, Nebraska, facility which was shut down last month because of the issues. The Swiss drug maker
has recalled bottles of Excedrin, Bufferin, Gas-X and NoDoz which may have
included mixed up pills.

Now the FDA says some of those over-the-counter pills may
have accidentally been packaged with powerful prescription painkillers made at
the same facility. The opioid drugs are sold by Endo Pharmaceuticals as
Percocet, Endocet, Opana and Zydone.

History of complaints: The Novartis plant in Lincoln, Nebraska, has been the target of hundreds of quality control complains in the last two years

FDA officials say they are not recalling the prescription drugs because
they are medically necessary and the likelihood that they contain stray pills
is low.

'The likelihood of finding a wrong tablet in an opiate pain medication dispensed to patients is low and patients should not be unduly alarmed,' FDA's Dr Edward Cox told reporters

Novartis said it has voluntarily suspended operations and shipments from its Lincoln, Nebraska, facility to rectify the problems at the site.

The plant has been under fire from inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration for its quality control. An FDA report said the company did not properly address any of the 223 critical complaints it received in 2011.

In 2010, the plant did not rectify 165 of the 587 complaints it got, according to the FDA.

Additionally, the company failed to investigate 166 reports of pills being packaged in the wrong bottles in 2009.

The Journal Star newspaper in Lincoln reported that the FDA blamed the problems on Novartis having too few people at the plant to review complaints. The staffers the company does have are poorly trained, the FDA, added.

Recalled: Excedrin is among the over-the-counter drugs that Novartis is pulling from store shelves

The Basel, Switzerland-based company said it is working to upgrade and improve manufacturing and training at the Nebraska plant before restarting production.

Company officials have said they don't know exactly how many bottles will be affected by the recall or when the factory will come back online.

Spokeswoman Julie Masow said there is no indication prescription pills actually got mixed up with Novaris over-the-counter drugs, but the recalls are a precaution.

The company said its Consumer Health unit will take a one-time charge currently estimated at $120 million in the fourth quarter relating to the recalls and improvements at the facility.

Novartis said it implemented the recall, which affects U.S. retailers, voluntarily and is working with the Food and Drug Administration during the process.

Quality control: Gas-X was another drug that could have broken tablets, mixed pills or mislabeled bottles, Novartis said

It became aware of the potential problem during an internal review that identified broken and chipped pills, and inconsistent bottle packaging that could cause pills to be mixed up.

The company said it wanted to make sure that customers didn't take any pills that they might be allergic to or that might become dangerous when mixed with their other medications, though it also said that there have been no such reports from consumers.

Novartis said that some of the bottles of headache medicine Excedrin and caffeine caplets NoDoz with expiration dates of Dec. 20, 2014, or earlier will be subject to the recall.

Some of the packages of pain medicine Bufferin and stomach medicine Gas-X with expiration dates of Dec. 20, 2013,or earlier will also be affected.

The company said it will post more information Monday at www.novartisOTC.com. Customers can also call the company at 1-888-477-2403 Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm EST.Â
