The team behind the new Star Wars film will hold a series of open auditions as they hunt for two lead roles for the forthcoming blockbuster.

The casting sessions for Star Wars: Episode VII will take place across the UK and Ireland, it has emerged.

Starting in Bristol on Saturday, 
aspiring actors and actresses will have the chance to meet casting 
directors for the Disney production in Glasgow, London, Manchester and 
Dublin.

Casting directors for the new Star Wars film are set to hold open auditions across the UK. Actors Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode IV, A New Hope in 1977

The new characters could follow in the footsteps of Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen who starred in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III, Revenge of the Sith

According to a casting notice the film-makers are looking for an actor and actress to fill two roles.

They are a 17-year-old 'street smart and strong' orphaned girl and a 'smart capable' man in his late teens or early 20s.

Twitter calling for two lead roles for an upcoming Disney film

The open auditions were first revealed on the Twitter account @UKopencall, which announced a 'nationwide search for lead roles for a Disney movie'.

Disney bought Lucasfilm, the production company behind the Star Wars series in October 2012.

The new film will be the first produced by Disney since taking over the film company founded by George Lucas - creator of the Star Wars franchise.

The description of the characters is almost the same as those leaked online earlier in the year when the overall casting process began, the BBC reported.In the past the Star Wars franchise has given little known actors and actresses major roles. In the original triology the then unknown Mark Hamill was cast in the role of Luke Skywalker.

The new production will form part of the third trilogy of films and is set to be directed by JJ Abrams, who is also co-scripting the film.

He is said to be annoyed that the movie is being filmed in London, having said he wished to avoid moving his family across the Atlantic.

After receiving high acclaim from critics for his direction of the first two Star Trek films, Abrams revealed earlier this year that he would not be taking the reins for the third installment as he prepares for his first foray into the Star Wars genre.

The announcement of his selection as director for the next blockbuster in the franchise came in January prompting speculation among fans and industry heavyweights as to whether or not he can correct a string of mediocre modern Star Wars films.

Star Wars creator George Lucas is set to act as a creative consultant for Episode VII, which will begin shooting at the Pinewood Studios next spring and is set to be released in 2015.

There is speculation cast members Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher from the original trilogy will appear in the film.
