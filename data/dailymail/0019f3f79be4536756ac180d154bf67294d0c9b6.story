Voyeur: Married Graham Bevan, 53, watched the 'explicit' footage on his home computer of three women in the bathroom of the Three Sisters and Bronte View residential home, in Haworth, West Yorks

A voyeuristic support worker at a care home filmed female colleagues using the toilet for his own 'perverted sexual gratification', a court heard.

Married Graham Bevan, 53, watched the 'explicit' footage on his home computer of three women in the bathroom of the Three Sisters and Bronte View residential home, in Haworth, West Yorks.

Today, a remorseful Bevan - who is 'ashamed and embarrassed' - was given a three-year supervision order, with a 9pm to 7am curfew, ordered to complete 100 hours unpaid work and sign the sex offenders' register for five years after pleading guilty to two counts of voyeurism and one of attempting to observe a person doing a private act, without their consent.

Bradford Crown Court heard Bevan, of Haworth, had worked at the residential home since 2007 and had secretly rigged up his Sony Ericsson mobile in the communal toilet and successfully recorded a number of colleagues.

Prosecutor Shamalia Qureshi said the phone was discovered on 1 December 2011 when a woman using the lavatory heard it vibrating and removed it and showed it to her supervisor.

'The defendant snatched it from her and went to the rear fire exit,' said Ms Qureshi.

'He was pressing buttons on the mobile phone and said he was deleting everything on the phone.'

Bevan apologised to the woman who'd found it, but the police were informed and he was arrested and admitted it was a 'silly thing to do.'

Police seized a Dell computer from his home and discovered seven videos had been downloaded featuring three of his female colleagues, and a male using the toilet.

Ms Qureshi said his victims viewed the footage.

She said: 'They were sickened and disgusted by what they had been shown and felt their privacy had been violated.'

Another stated: 'I'm upset someone I trusted and worked with could do this. He makes my skin crawl. He makes me feel so sick.'

Mitigating Arshad Mahmood said Bevan had not shown the videos to anybody else and he had initially set up the phone to record how many people were using the toilet.

'However, it transpired that when he saw the videos he was aroused and so he accepts he kept these on his computer system,' said Mr Mahmood, who added Bevan had been fired by the residential home.

Captured: Bevan had worked at Three Sisters and Bronte View residential home, in Haworth, West Yorks., since 2007 where he secretly rigged up his Sony Ericsson mobile in the communal toilet and successfully recorded a number of colleagues

'He is extremely ashamed and embarrassed.'

Sentencing Judge John Potter told Bevan: 'The purpose of these offences was to fulfill your own perverted sexual gratification.

'This was in any view an insidious offence which must have caused distress to your victims when they were told what had occurred.

'It was your own work colleagues that you were abusing in this organised and systematic way.'

The judge also imposed a sexual offences prevention order banning Bevan working further in residential care homes, entering his former employment or contacting his victims.
