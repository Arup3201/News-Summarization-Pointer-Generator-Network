A California woman who was in New York to attend a friend's wake was critically injured when a cab hit her while she was loading her luggage into a taxi before heading to JFK to fly home.

Rosemarie Mifsud, 42, became wedged between the two taxis outside 750 Seventh Avenue in Midtown Manhattan early Monday.

Mifsud, who has two sons aged eight and 11, was putting luggage into the trunk of a cab in the middle lane of traffic when the second vehicle, a van, smashed into her from behind.

Rosemarie Mifsud, 42, got stuck between two taxis on Seventh Avenue in Midtown Manhattan this morning

She was headed back to city of Livermore which is on the edge of the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Her husband, Bill Mifsud, said the taxi 'pinned her', the New York Daily News reported.

He said: 'She was putting luggage in the trunk.

'So from her perspective it just came out of nowhere. 

'He hit her pretty hard.'

Bill plans to fly out to New York to be with Mifsud during the recovery process.

The Mifsuds live in Livermore, California, and have two sons together aged eight and 11 (pictured above) 

Mifsud, who works in software technology, was brought by ambulance to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.

She underwent extensive surgery but it seems likely there will be some permanent damage. 

Her legs were in really bad shape and an officer at the scene used his belt as tourniquet, the New York Post reported. 

Leon Mass was working at a nearby food cart and saw what happened. 

He said: 'The bones were sticking out of her leg.

'She was wearing jeans.

'There was a cop who wrapped the belt around her to stop the bleeding. 

'She was just so calm. 

'She screamed and then she was just so quiet.'

The stretch of Seventh Avenue where the accident occurred (above) would have been dark early this morning 

Mohamed Gendia, 34, was driving the cab that struck her.

He has a clean record and has been working as a licensed driver for more than a year, according to the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). 

Mohamed Gendia said he didn't see Mifsud, according to DNAinfo. 

He told TLC investigators: 'It was dark. I braked and I slid. The brake didn't help me.

'I thought I hit the car, not her.'

It is unknown if he will be charged or face any other sort of disciplinary action.

A lawyer hired by the family, Brian O'Dwyer, said: 'Given the circumstances of the accident we are asking that the police department and district attorney take a very close look at pursuing charges.'
