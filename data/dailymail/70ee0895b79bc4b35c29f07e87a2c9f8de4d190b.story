With blue waves tumbling over them, these surfers glide underneath a tunnel of water.

The surfers are pictured in a barrel, where the wave is hollow when it is breaking, and wiping out from the unique perspective of under the water.

These stunning photographs are from two different sets, one taken across the beaches of Western Australia, by Michael Riley, 28, and the other taken off the coast of Tahiti, by Ben Thouards, 27.

Both of the photo-sets manage to capture the very different and distinct experiences happening to surfers every time they take to the waves, from the elation of riding the waves, and the spectacular feeling of wiping out.

The underwater photography was not just of wipeouts, also documenting skilled surfing from a unique perspective

Riley, originally from San Diego, California, spent yeas working as a fisherman before moving to Australia. He said: 'My childhood bedroom was wall to wall surfing barrel shots and even the 
ceiling was covered with all the different covers from magazines.

'It wasn't until I moved to Australia and started to earn some decent 
money fishing that I could afford the equipment I would need to help me 
pursue my dream of shooting in the water.

'When I look at my photos I want to see the most perfect moment of the 
wave; no water drops on the port of the camera, perfect back lit waves, 
and a surfer nice and deep in the barrel.

'When I get one of those special shots I get so excited and it motivates 
me to get out there and get something better than I got before.'

Some of the waves reach massive heights, while others are a lot smaller but with a higher speed, making surfing them masterful and challenging

Standing for hours in the water observing and shooting the waves, Micheal has to decide where the prime position for getting the shots was.

He said: 'I get a lot of positive feedback from people about my photos and that really helps me keep really interested in what I do. I love capturing all the moments that would otherwise go unnoticed, and when people see them they seem to be happy and excited.

'It's a really good feeling to see everyone freak out when you take a really special shot. However I do think that it will take a lifetime to get the perfect shot.

'I don't know if I will ever consider anything that I created to be perfect, but I will do my best to get as close as I can until then.

Many surfers off the coast of Tahiti have to be exceptionally skilled in order to avoid the coral sea bed which can be very painful to crash in to

Trying his hardest to sidestep any sharks that might be lurking in the waters, Michael explains the risk of shooting in this type of location.

He said: 'There have been a number a recent shark attacks in Western Australia and the water is become a very terrifying place to be.

'When you are out in a remote location and the waves are a bit slow you start to think sometimes and it really can mess with you head.

'You know they are out there, you just pray that you aren't going to run in to one. The water can be very shallow where the waves are breaking but sometimes you have to swim over deep waters to get to certain spots.Â 

'That's what really scares me, I feel like bait for a white pointer every time.'

The barrel riding maneuver is one of the hardest surfing techniques to pull off, requiring excellent balance and control of speed to successfully ride inside the curving wave without wiping out

The images of surfers in Tahiti show surfing in a different and whole new serene way. Water Photographer Ben Thouards, who lives on the tropical island of Tahiti, risks his life every day to shoot surfers who dare to take on the deadly waves.

The small village located on Teahupoo, the south-west coast of the island attracts surfers from far and wide, and has been named amongst the worlds top 10 deadliest waves.

But, with a studio near the beach and a love for the water, Ben continues to shoot great photographs and says he wouldnt stop for the world.
