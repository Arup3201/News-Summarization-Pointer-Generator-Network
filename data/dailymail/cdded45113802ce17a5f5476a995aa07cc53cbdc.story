Carer Faye Gibson, 36, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, was jailed yesterday for fraud after admitting stealing money from elderly men she was working for

A carer who agreed to marry the 74-year-old she was looking after has been jailed after stealing the money he had saved to pay for his funeral.

Drug addict Faye Gibson, 36, got engaged to vulnerable Alan Buck without his relatives knowing and then plundered his Post Office account, a court heard.

The mother-of-one from Beverley, East Yorkshire, also stole money from another man she cared for, 96-year-old Eric Moran, after he had asked her to do some shopping for him.

Yesterday Gibson was jailed at Hull Crown Court after admitting two charges of fraud by abusing her position of trust as a carer.

The court was told that Mr Buck, who suffers from heart problems and lives in supervised housing, had employed Gibson for seven years to help him with domestic chores.

Prosecutor Sobia Ahmed said: 'They formed a relationship and got engaged four years ago, although Mr Buck's family were not aware of it.'

The court heard that Mr Buck trusted Gibson with his Post Office card, giving her access to his account in which he said he had £2,500 saved to cover his funeral expenses.

But when he checked his account, he discovered the balance was just £4.  Gibson was arrested and Mr Buck's card found at her home, while her bank statements showed large cash deposits, the court heard.

Ms Ahmed said Mr Buck's daughter said her father had now become suspicious of strangers since the theft, and forgot to take his medication.

Gibson also stole money from her client Mr Moran, who has lived alone since the death of his wife two years ago and who suffers mobility problems.

The prosecutor said Mr Moran had employed Gibson for eight years and often took him shopping to Morrisons.

She said the elderly man noticed money was missing from his Halifax bank account and told police the only person who had access to his details was Gibson. 

Gibson admitted stealing £980 from Mr Buck and £3,900 from Mr Moran, though both men said more was missing from their accounts.

Gibson was sentenced to three months in prison at Hull Crown Court, left, by Judge Michael Mettyear, right

Charlotte Baines, defending, said: 'She recognises this was despicable behaviour and regrets it.

'She
 lapsed into heroin addiction, which she started when she was 21, 
although these two men had no idea she was taking illicit substances.'

Sentencing her to three months in prison, Judge Michael Mettyear told Gibson: 'A clear and consistent message needs to be sent out by the courts that people who care for the elderly and vulnerable and commit dishonesty against them will go to prison.'

He said he had borne in mind her guilty plea and the age of her son, which had dramatically reduced the sentence he could have passed.
