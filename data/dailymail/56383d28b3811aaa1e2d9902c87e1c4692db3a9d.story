A Canadian jihadist once thought to be dead has re-emerged to declare that ISIS is prepared to attack the United States at any moment.

Farah Mohamed Shirdon, a 21-year-old former movie theater employee from Calgary, told Vice News last week that 'a lot of brothers are mobilizing there right now in the West, thanks to Allah.'

Shirdon, who was declared dead in widespread news reports in August, said the ultimate goal of the militant Islamic group is to fly the black ISIS flag above the White House.

Iraqi calling: Canadian-Somali Farah Mohamed Shirdon left his home country for Iraq, where the 21-year-old is fighting alongside ISIS terrorists. He says a strike on American soil is imminent

'God willing, we will make some attacks in New York soon,' Shirdon said. 'Mobilizing for a brilliant attack, my friend.'

Vice conducted the interview September 23 via the internet after tracking the terrorist down through social media.

'I know so many people, thousands upon thousands upon thousands, that are living in the West that are ready right now to make an operation in your land,' he said from Iraq.

Shirdon, one of many Somali-Canadians believed to have traveled to the Middle East to fight for ISIS, is seen in one YouTube video burning his passport along with other foreign fighters.

'This is a message to Canada and all the American tyrants,' he said in the April video. 'We are coming and we will destroy you, with permission from Allah the almighty.'

'This is a message to Canada and all the American tyrants,' Shirdon said in an April video. 'We are coming and we will destroy you, with permission from Allah the almighty.'

In the interview, Shirdon makes clear that it's his beliefs--not the influence of other men--that led him to fight alongside ISIS.

'No one recruited me,' he told Vice. 'All I did, I opened the newspaper, I read the Koran. Very easy.'

Shirdon said he was interviewed by Canadian authorities just days before he was able to slip out of the country.

'All their intelligence workers are imbeciles,' he said.

Shirdon's interview came as the U.S. and its allies ramped up aerial assaults on Syria cities occupied by ISIS. Shirdon said he's under assault 'day and night,' notes the National Post.

'You attack one of us, we will attack one of you,' he said. 'We will stop when we behead the kuffar [disbelievers] and when we turn his children into our slaves.'
