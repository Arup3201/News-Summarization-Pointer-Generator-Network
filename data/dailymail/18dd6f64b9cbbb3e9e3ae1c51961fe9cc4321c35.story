The two doctors missing for two days in the Blue Mountains have been found safe and well by search teams.

Bupa Australia’s Chief Medical Officer and Medical Director both failed to return home from a bush walk  on Saturday night. 

Dr Paul Bates was last seen on Saturday morning

NSW Police said the men were discovered by an SES team in a canyon on Monday morning.

'About 10am today, an SES search team made voice contact with the two men in an area in the vicinity of Du Faurs Creek,' police said.

'It’s expected to take approximately half an hour to reach the men, due to the dense bushland in the surrounding area,' they added. 

Dr Paul Bates, 58 of Mosman, and Chris Dalton, 57, of Chatswood, were last seen at 6.30am on Saturday as they embarked on a day trip bush walk at Mount Wilson in Sydney's Blue Mountains.

Bupa Australia’s spokesperson Brooke Lord told Daily Mail Australia: 'We are hugely concerned by the news that they didn't return from their hike. Our thoughts are with both Paul and Chris's family and friends.’

Mrs Lord said she knew both men personally and that 'they are both very active men and fit, healthy, outdoorsy types’.

‘My hopes and the whole business’s hopes are they are found safe and well today,' she added. 

Police found their car parked in a dirt car park next to the Mount Wilson fire shed.

Blue Mountains rescue police said: ‘A canyoning group failed to return from a trip yesterday. 

Chris Dalton, 57, has been described as an active and outdoorsy man 

‘The two men from Sydney intended on doing a canyon in Bell Creek and were expecting to return yesterday afternoon. The group left details of their intended trip with family members.’

Blue Mountains Police, POLAIR, Police Rescue and NSW Ambulance Special Operations originally searched the bushland near where their car was located.

The search for the men resumed at 8am on Monday morning. 

On Bupa’s website Dr Bates is described as a ‘passionate healthcare advocate’.

Before joining Bupa he was the National Medical Director for Innovations at OptumHealth, one of the USA's largest health companies.

Meanwhile, his friend Mr Dalton worked as an ear, nose and throat surgeon at The Sydney Children’s Hospital in Randwick for 17 years before joining Serco and then Bupa.
