In this latest of Sportsmail's reviews of the candidates for William Hill's Sports Book of the Year award for 2014, NICK METCALFE looks at Simon Inglis's Played in London.

Putting it quite simply, this is a remarkable book.

You don't have to be a Londoner to enjoy Played in London, though that would help. You don't even have to like sport, though if you do it will add to your enjoyment considerably. More than anything else, this is just a fascinating education.

Author Simon Inglis has impressive form when it comes to presenting the history of sport, going back to his days of writing about the football grounds of Britain in the 1980s.

Wembley Stadium - seen here during the 1932 FA Cup final between Arsenal and Newcastle - features in Simon Inglis's 'Played in London'. It is possibly the capital's most famous sporting venue

This latest effort - in the running to be William Hill Sports Book of the Year - is part of a 'Played in Britain' season, and is extraordinary in both its scope and levels of research. 

One of the beauties of this book is that you can become engrossed in certain sections and then put it down for a couple of days, before returning to enjoy more. It's a frame of reference, a treasure trove of information. Time and time again, I found myself amazed by the sheer level of detail in this book. But I suspect that, for Inglis, this is very much a labour of love.

The book takes us back many centuries, to sports such as cock-fighting and bull-baiting, and also tells us the tale of many of our favourite sports of today.

All the major sports have their own chapter – football fans will love the stories behind their favourite London club, rugby fans will relish the guide to the capital's many famous grounds.

I'm particularly interested in the history of London's swimming pools, both outdoors and indoors, and found those sections provided an invaluable insight into the past. Most of us have heard about some of these places, like Brockwell Lido or Tooting Bec, or perhaps even visited them, but how many of us know anything about their history, their heritage? 

Tooting Bec Lido in south London - seen here in this 1996 picture - is one of many outdoor and indoor swimming pools to be featured in the book

There's that word - heritage. Inglis comes back to it time and time again. The author can't disguise the fact that he's a sporting romantic. He knows the value of sport in our lives. And he knows its importance in the story of the capital. Inglis tells us right at the start that no city on earth has such a rich sporting heritage.

In most ways, London could never escape its incredible past - it's there in its churches, its parks, its stations. And it's very much there in its sport too. The author is clearly anxious that we continue to preserve it as much as we can. The disappointment comes through the pages when Inglis writes of a club being disbanded, or a pool shutting down.

As you would expect, some of the most fabled sporting venues in the world feature heavily in the book, such as Wembley, Lord’s and Wimbledon. Many lesser known arenas are here too, some of them sadly gone, like Walthamstow Stadium and West Ham Stadium.

There are guides to grandstands, greyhound tracks, bowling greens and billiard halls. In every sense, this guide is an extensive and exhaustive one.

The book is visually delightful too; I'm pretty certain most readers will never have seen many of the wonderful pictures on show. They help to provide a quite magical snapshot into London's past, and sometimes present too.

This really is a splendid effort, which helps to tell us part of the long story of the capital, and I'm certain it will still have relevance a century from now. 

Inglis and Jackie Spreckley, should be proud of themselves. This book not only feels special, it feels vital too. Some achievement.

Look out for reviews of the other books in the running for the award thoughout this week.
