A house party in Michigan got out of hand on Saturday night after the organizer advertised the event on Facebook and more than 2,000 guests, some as young as 14 years old, showed up.

According to organizer James Taylor, 21, the event at his parent’s remote home in Hinton Township had started out as a small birthday for a friend and also as a going away party for himself before he moves to California.

Unfortunately for Taylor, he and his parents now faces police charges after the event – advertised online as #ProjectP - quickly descended into chaos as more than 2,000 people showed up at the property, encouraged by an invitation on Facebook which said everyone was welcome.

Out of control: A party at James Taylor's family farm house in Michigan got out of hand on Saturday night after the event was advertized on Facebook and more than 2,000 guests, some as young as 14 years old, showed up

A defiant Taylor told reporters: 'I didn't force anything down anyone's throat. I didn't make anyone stay here until 7 a.m. or 11 a.m.'

‘We had people calling 911 from the party saying people are freaking out or overdosing or falling down,’ Casey Nemeth, deputy sergeant with Mecosta County Sheriff's Office, told WZZM13. ‘And they couldn't even get an ambulance down the road.’

Deputies said they originally responded to calls that cars were illegally parked, but once on scene they witnessed multiple accounts of underage drinking and drug use with some party-goers as young as 14-years-old.

EMS transported at least seven people to the hospital: six people for possible drug and alcohol overdoses, then one man who fell off the barn while intoxicated, who was in serious condition.

Authorities are also investigating an alleged sexual assault of a 19-year-old woman.

Taylor told reporters afterwards that he was thankful the police came to break-up the rave.

The floors shook: The party was so crowded people couldn't pass by one another and the floors of James Taylor's farmhouse trembled

'People could have been lying out in my yard dead this morning,’ he told Fox. 'I’m glad the police were here and the ambulances.'

Taylor said that while he takes responsibility for throwing the party, he doesn’t think it is his fault that people overdosed.

'I didn’t force anything down anyone’s throat. I didn’t make anyone stay here until 7 a.m. or 11 a.m. or whenever it is that everyone finally left. I didn’t make this kid pass out on my floor. People wanted to be here. That was their decision,' he said.

Taylor also said that he didn't know there were minors at his party but that those children's parents should be blamed over him.

'If you are a parent that’s got a 14-year-old child that’s been able to be at my house all night, and according to the police there was a lot of them here. So, I think some parents should do some reflections on their parenting before they start getting mad at me.'

Taylor protests that he even offered all of his 2,000 guests the option of crashing at his home so none of them had to drive home drunk.

When asked if he plans to have another party on the property, Taylor joked, 'there's always a coming home party.'
