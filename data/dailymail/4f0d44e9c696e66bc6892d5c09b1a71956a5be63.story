The Detroit teenager shot dead after she knocked on a man’s door for help in the early hours of the morning last November was scared and disoriented after crashing her car, said one of the last people who saw her alive.

Black teenager Renisha McBride was killed around 4.30am on November 2 by white homeowner Theodore Wafer, 54, who shot her through the screen door of his home in Dearborn Heights.

One of the last people to see McBride before she her death was Carmen Beasley, who told a Detroit courtroom on Wednesday that said she heard a loud bang outside her suburban home three-and-a-half hours earlier.

Carmen Beasley, one of the last people to see Renisha McBride alive, told a Detroit courtroom on Wednesday that the teenager had appeared scared and disoriented when she saw her on the early hours of November 2

When Beasley went to investigate she she found her husband's parked car had been hit. She called 911 and then went outside to help McBride, she said.

'I told her she was injured and we needed to get an ambulance,' said Beasley. 'I didn’t want to be intrusive, but I knew she was hurt.'

Beasley said McBride appeared drunk, confused and was staggering and didn't know her home phone number when she asked for it, reports ABC News.

McBride walked away from the scene several times, according to Beasley, and disappeared before an ambulance arrived.

Theodore Wafer, the man accused of killing McBride had earlier told the court that he heard her 'boom, boom, boom' at least four separate times before he opened the door and shot her in the face.

The pounding caused Wafer to fear for his life, his defense lawyer argued, and made his use of force justifiable under Michigan self-defense law.

Wafer claims he acted in self-defense, but prosecutors say his actions were unreasonable.

An autopsy found she was drunk and had marijuana in her system.

McBride's pounding on the door at such
 an early hour led Wafer to think his life was in danger, defense 
attorney Cheryl Carpenter told jurors.

'"People
 were trying to get in." That was reasonable for Ted to believe and 
that's what he believed that night," Carpenter said, according to the 
Detroit Free Press. 'Why? He doesn't have a clue.'

McBride
 had been smoking marijuana most of the day before she was killed. Her 
friend, Amber Jenkins said that McBride had been at her house partying 
that night. The pair played drinking games and smoked three blunts 
together.

Ms Jenkins estimated that McBride had half a fifth of New Amsterdam Vodka - which sells for about $12 to $14.

Prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark says Wafer could have called police instead of shooting McBride.

Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter says Wafer feared for his life.

But Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark told jurors that despite the loud noises of McBride knocking on Wafer's door - she was no threat to him and never was.

'There was no prying (of the doors) or no kicking,' she said, according to the Detroit News.

The screen door, which Wafer fired through to shoot McBride, was still locked when police arrived.

The shooting has stoked racial tensions in Detroit. McBride's family and community activists have compared her death to that of Trayvon Martin - another unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a man who claimed self-defense.

The jury of 12 and two alternates is made up of seven men and seven women. Four jurors are black.
