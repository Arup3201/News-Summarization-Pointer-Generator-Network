Two travel companies have apologised and offered hundreds of pounds in compensation to a pair of holidaymakers whose trip was cut short without warning.

Michael Haye, 69, and his 63-year-old wife, June, said their holiday to the Spanish island of Majorca was ruined when it was shortened by four days.

The Hayes, from Fareham, Hampshire, were furious when they arrived at their hotel, Sentido Punta del Mar, in Santa Ponsa, and were informed that their 11-day getaway was instead a seven-day trip.

They booked the Thomas Cook holiday through a Thomson travel agent but both companies failed to inform them that the date of their return flight had changed.

Mr Haye, who is retired, told the Portsmouth News: ‘Had we known earlier that it had been cut short, then we could have gone elsewhere.

‘It was the fact that they didn’t tell us that upset us. My wife was in tears.’

The Hayes were not satisfied with how their complaints were handled by the on-site hotel rep and the company’s customer service representatives, claiming no one initially took responsibility for the gaffe.

Thomas Cook agreed to reimburse the couple £248 for the hotel and give them £400 in compensation, the Portsmouth News reported.

Thomson offered an additional £170 in compensation.

After receiving compensation eight weeks after the September trip, Mr Haye said: ‘This is not a trumpet-blowing exercise. Well, perhaps a little, but we feel we’ve won a battle for the little man.’

In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, a Thomas Cook spokesperson said a change to its flight programme saw the couple’s holiday curtailed to seven nights.

The spokesman said: ‘The few customers affected by this change should have been advised of this in advance of travel either directly by ourselves or through our travel agency partners, with all refunded the difference in price.

‘Although our records show that our colleagues in the Thomson store were advised, Mr and Mrs Haye were unfortunately not informed prior to their departure.

‘We would like to assure the Haye family, and indeed all our customers, that we are collaborating with our partners to establish the reasons behind this miscommunication, with a view to ensuring that this remains an isolated incident.’

Thomson said its staff were not told of the change to the couple’s flights.

A spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: ‘Thomson acted solely as a third-party booking agent on this occasion and the change in duration of the holiday was out of our control.

‘Unfortunately, whilst an update was received by the reservation system, no alert or communication was sent to advise our staff of the change.

In the absence of any notification and as no updated tickets were provided to us, our staff did not have any details to advise the customer of.’
