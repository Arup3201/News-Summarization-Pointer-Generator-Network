Abu Qatada returned home yesterday – as a Government terror adviser warned it could be years before he is kicked out of Britain.

The fanatic, who was granted bail by a court on Monday, was driven from his high-security prison and back to the family home.

He smirked as he stepped out of a people carrier to face chants of 'out, out, out' from furious protesters.

David Cameron, on a visit to Italy, 
said he was 'fed up' that Qatada was on the streets and Downing Street 
said the Government would appeal against the decision to block his 
deportation to Jordan.

'I'm fed up he's still at large in our
 country,' the Prime Minister said. 'He has no right to be there, we 
believe he is a threat to our country.

'We have moved heaven and earth to try
 to comply with every single dot and comma of every single convention to
 get him out of our country.

'It is extremely frustrating and I share the British people's frustration with the situation we find ourselves in.'

But he did not respond to calls from 
Tory backbenchers who want Britain to withdraw from the European Court 
of Human Rights or simply to ignore Strasbourg's ruling in the case.

In the House of Commons, Justice 
Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'All of us believe the law should not 
operate in this way and this case underlines my view that there is a 
very real need for major changes to the way the European human rights 
framework operates.'

Front-door: Abu Qatada returned home this week after his second period of time in prison. Housing benefit is understood to cover his current rent of £1,900 a month

David Anderson QC, the Home Office's 
Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, told the BBC: 'It's a 
very frustrating episode for all concerned but as far as I can see this 
is not the end of the road.'

He said the key to the case lies in Jordan, which must change its criminal code to stop evidence obtained by torture being used.

Mr Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa 
May are expected to hold talks on Qatada with Jordan's King Abdullah II 
when he visits London next week.

A Jordanian minister said  yesterday the country would be 'co-ordinating closely' with  Britain over the next steps in the case.

But, even if there is agreement, the case would go through the British courts again and could even return to Strasbourg.

Mr Anderson said: 'We could be looking at months, we could be looking at a very few years.'

Smiling Qatada was driven out of 
high-security Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire just before 11.30am 
in a Mercedes people carrier. When the Islamist – once described as 
Osama Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe – arrived home in Wembley he 
was greeted by protesters.

They held up a 'Get rid of Abu Qatada' banner and shouted 'Get him out!' as he walked indoors.

Ex-soldier Aaron Baker, 31, who led 
the protest, said: 'I think it's disgusting he's still here. It's scary.
 I've got two young children who go to school round here.'

Another protester, Anthony Mellish, 19, added: 'It's a peaceful area. We don't need a terrorist here.'

Qatada's release was ordered by a 
special immigration court which ruled on Monday that sending him back to
 Jordan to face terror charges would breach his human rights.  He will 
be allowed out between 8am and 4pm and be monitored by the police and 
MI5 at a cost of £100,000 a week.

Under his bail conditions, he is 
banned from using the internet, owning a mobile phone or meeting anyone 
on a list of individuals.

He also cannot lead prayers, give lectures, preach or provide religious instruction other than to his wife and children at home.

The court's ruling was based on a Strasbourg judgment that he could be prosecuted on the basis of evidence obtained by torture.

Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg urged the 
Government to follow Henry VIII's ruling that it was high treason to 
appeal to a court outside his kingdom. He said: 'Has not the time come 
for this Parliament to legislate to prohibit appeals to foreign courts 
and to prohibit the judgments of foreign courts leading our judiciary?'

Qatada featured in hate sermons found on videos in the flat of one of the September 11 bombers.

Mr Justice Mitting

He has been a High Court judge since 2001 and head of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission – the court which freed Qatada – since 2007.Cambridge-educated, he became a QC in 1987. In May 2010 the 64-year-old judge  ruled that two Pakistani students who posed a significant threat to national security could not be sent home.He said he was satisfied that Abid Naseer was an Al Qaeda operative and that his friend Ahmed Faraz Khan planned an attack on Britain. However he ruled that they faced illegal detention, torture and ill-treatment if returned. In 2010 he ruled hook-handed fanatic Abu Hamza could keep his UK passport, because taking it away would breach his human rights.Judge Peter Lane

He was criticised in 2010 for overturning a decision to deport a foreign student caught working illegally.The Ghanaian student, 29, at the University of Sunderland was found working as a security guard for longer than the permitted 20 hours a week, and as a result the Home Office refused to allow him to stay in Britain. Judge Lane ruled deporting him would breach his human rights, stating: 'The public interest in maintaining an effective immigration control, whilst important, is not a fixity.'Dame Denise Holt

She was Ambassador to Mexico between 2002 and 2005 and to Spain from 2007 to 2009. The 63-year-old sits on the panel as the non-legal member with experience of national security matters.She is also a board member of Ofqual, the exams regulator and a member of the NHS Pay Review Body which decides how much doctors and nurses should be paid.She is an independent director of HSBC Bank and works for the Alzheimer's Society.
