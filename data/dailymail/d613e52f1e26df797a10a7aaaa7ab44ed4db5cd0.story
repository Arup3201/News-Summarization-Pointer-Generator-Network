Eleven years after their adoptive father was bludgeoned to death by their mother's lover in their Hamptons mansion, the Ammon twins have revealed the guilt they endured following his murder.

In their first interview, Alexa and Greg Ammon, now 22, spoke out about how their mother had turned them against their father before his death, as she used them as pawns in her bitter divorce battle.

And the manipulation was so successful that Alexa was left carrying the guilt 'for years' over her final scathing words to her father before he was murdered in October 2001, when she was just 11.

'It's hard to know that the last thing you said before your dad died was that you hated him,' Alexa told Katie Couric.

Battle: They spoke about how their mother turned them against their father before his murder in 2001

Ted and Generosa Ammon had the picture perfect family after they adopted the twins as toddlers from a Ukrainian orphanage, but after 17 years of marriage, the relationship began to crumble.

Following their separation, as Generosa fought for half of his $80 million fortune, things turned ugly.

Greg explained to Katie: 'There were times if we weren't awful to 
our father or spying on him, or going through his drawers, mom would be really awful to us back home.'

Alexa added: 'She just hated the fact that we loved our father, that we loved a man she didn't love anymore.'

Lavish: They still own the mansion in East Hampton where their father was found dead

Instead, their mother encouraged they love her boyfriend, an electrician from Long Island named Danny Pelosi, who divorced his own wife three months after their father's death - and the man eventually convicted of the murder.

'To have somebody in our life who was more concrete, more permanent, was great,' Alexa said. 'When our mom was telling us... this is the man you should love, it messed with our minds.'

The twins, who have now made a documentary about their lives, were at their father's house in Manhattan when the 52-year-old was bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of his Hamptons home.

Their aunt told them that their father had been killed, and their mother later added that he 'had killed himself with pills of some sort', Greg told Katie.

'Everything was so crazy that for the longest time I thought he wasn't even dead,' Alexa said. 'I thought he faked his own death.'

Divided: The couple separated and were locked in a bitter custody battle at the time of Ammon's death

Missed: Alexa said her mother turned them against her father, which she regretted for years after his death

The children were left without parents for a second time when Generosa was diagnosed with breast cancer and died in August 2003. The children went to live with their aunt in Alabama.

Pelosi, who had been battling for a 
part of the fortune left by his late wife, was eventually arrested in 
March 2004 and was found guilty of murder.

He has maintained that Generosa hired a hit man to kill her husband. He will not be eligible for parole until 2031. But the twins admit they were not convinced he was a killer until he was convicted.

'I still had doubts up until that point,' Alexa said. 'I was so convinced he was innocent. I don't know what he did to my mind. He's a psychopath.

Both Alexa and Greg are now certain he was to blame, and say they choose to believe their mother was not a part of their father's death.

Despite enduring such tragedy before they were teenagers, the twins pulled through.

'We had each other so that was one thing,' Greg said. 'It was not easy.'

Greg eventually moved to Los Angeles 
and started a film production company while Alexa managed a band in 
South Carolina - but came back together to film the documentary for 
closure.

The twins, who inherited $1 
million each after taxes and attorneys' fees, also decided to use the 
opportunity of the documentary to find their biological family in the Ukraine.

Searching
through documents at the mansion, they find papers leading them to the 
orphanage from where they were adopted as malnourished 
children.

They learn that 
they were the result of a one-night tryst between their mother and a 
soldier. The government then took them from their mother as she 
struggled with alcoholism and mental problems.

Thankful: Greg and Alexa Ammon, 22, have made a documentary revealing the torment they suffered after the murder of their father by their mother's lover in 2001 - but said the family saved them

Old life: In the film, they return to the Ukrainian orphanage and say they'd have died if they were not adopted

She was also a prostitute, who begged for money on the streets to buy alcohol. 
She died in 2004 and left behind a total of eight children, some of whom went to the same orphanage as the twins.

The documentary shows them meeting their three half siblings and speaking to another brother on the phone in Moscow.

Despite being adopted into a life of bitter custody disputes and murderous affairs, they are thankful to the Ammons for taking them in - otherwise they would have died in the orphanage.

Alexa told Katie Couric how she had tuberculosis, which was not treatable in the Ukraine.

'Our parents saved us,' Greg said. 'Alexa would not be here if it was not for mom and dad.'

'They literally gave us life,' his sister added. 'It's an amazing thing.'
