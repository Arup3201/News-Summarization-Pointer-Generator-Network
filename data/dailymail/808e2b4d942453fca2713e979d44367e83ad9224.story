Even Bronte country has developed a taste for baguettes as Yorkshire gears up for the start of the 101st Tour de France in its backyard this weekend.

In Haworth, the village made famous by the Bronte sisters, the world-famous museum in their honour will close on Sunday because of the huge crowds expected along Main Street to see Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish climb up the cobbles.

‘The sisters would have found it exciting — not a lot happened in Haworth in their day,’ says museum director Ann Insdale.

‘Charlotte in particular loved anything to do with France. She studied in Brussels and spoke fluent French. She’d have enjoyed having such an iconic event here.’

It seems Yorkshire’s current generation feel the same. Everywhere you look, the white rose county is turning yellow to mark the greatest endurance test in sport.

Police anticipate at least a million people will turn up to watch Saturday’s opening 118-mile stage between Leeds and Harrogate — known as Le Grand Depart — and Sunday’s York-Sheffield leg, which measures 124 miles.

And if the major population centres are getting excited, ‘real Yorkshire’ is beside itself as the world’s greatest cyclists speed through places such as Kettlewell and Cragg Vale against the breathtaking backdrop of the Yorkshire Dales.

Yellow-painted bikes, flags, pennants and model riders have sprung up everywhere, from  outside schools and pubs to shop windows and even cemeteries.

As Gordon Love, from Swaledale in the north of the county, puts it: ‘For anyone who doesn’t understand the fuss, these are roads I have grown up cycling on. To have the Tour riding on them is unbelievable.

'If you are a football fan, it is the equivalent of the World Cup coming to play on your local Sunday League ground. There’ll be chaos, and no doubt rain, but, all in all, fantastic.’

In arty Hebden Bridge, the enterprising manager of the Blazing Saddles bike shop, Alan Boult, has attained a special alcohol licence to allow his garage to become a makeshift pub.

Not that the straight-talking Yorkshire public will put on airs and graces because Froome and Co are in town. 

Where's Wiggins? Bradley Wiggins was dropped by Team Sky

Boult says: ‘One of my customers saw a guy on a flash bike, wearing all the gear and said: “Who does he think he is . . . Bradley Wiggins?” It was only when he went by he realised it was Bradley Wiggins out training!’

Wiggins’ absence from the tour after being dropped by Team Sky is a disappointment, but it’s unikely to keep many away. There are still four British riders including Cavendish, whose mum comes from Harrogate.

The peloton won’t face any climbs like those in The Alps, but the locals in Cragg Vale are proud to have the longest continuous hill in England — nearly six miles long and taking riders from residential homes up into farmland and eventually on to the exposed moors.

Roger Wood, landlord of the Robin Hood pub halfway up the climb, is excited, if a little daunted. ‘The council have said there might be 35,000 people visiting Cragg Vale. If that’s the case, it might get a little awkward — my pub gets crowded if there are any more than a hundred people in it.’

His customers knew the Tour was on its way when French cycling legend Bernard Hinault popped in and supped a pint of Abbeydale Bitter during a recent fact-finding mission. He declared himself satisfied and told locals: ‘This tour is going to be a big party.’

A few hundred yards up from the pub, Cragg Vale infant school is bedecked in yellow, with four bikes — complete with scarecrow-style riders — tied to the railings. It is as if each village is keen not to be outdone by another.

Addingham, seven miles east of Skipton with a population of just 3,500, has the privilege of having the cyclists go through on both Saturday and Sunday. A giant flag pinned up next to the road  proclaims: ‘Addingham 2014: So good, it’s coming twice.’

All over Yorkshire, people will throw off their traditional caution. Many hotels and bed-and-breakfasts were fully booked shortly after the announcement was made about the Tour 18 months ago.

Nobody knows the exact size of crowds expected across the region but they are going to be huge.

Temporary campsites have been set up along almost every route so people can get a good position early.

But Sir Rodney Walker, chairman of the company formed to oversee Grand Depart, warns: ‘Do not expect to wake up on a nice sunny day in early July and say “Shall we go and watch?” It won’t happen. You have to plan.’
