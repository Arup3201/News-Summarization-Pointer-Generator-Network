Tourist David Willis, of Dallas, Texas, told followers that he had been locked inside the Waterstones store in Trafalgar Square for at least two hours

An American tourist who was locked into a London bookshop by mistake last night today declared 'it feels good to be free'.

David Willis, of Dallas, Texas, had been browsing in Waterstones on Trafalgar Square last night when he discovered the shop had been closed and he had been locked in.

He then spent two hours inside the darkened store, desperately calling for help, before he was eventually rescued after he used Twitter to alert the world to his predicament.

This morning Mr Willis told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I'm very tired, I did not sleep much last night but it feels good to be free.'

He said he nipped in to the bookshop just before 9pm, not realising it was about to close, and walked past employees as he went upstairs to sit down and use the internet.

Around 15 minutes later he got up to leave, but when he walked downstairs he discovered it was 'completely dark and the door is locked'.

He added: 'Right when I came downstairs I saw I had been locked in and I went to the door, tried to open it, the alarm went off. 

'The alarm sounded in Trafalgar Square for probably 20 or 25 minutes.

'The phone rang after about ten minutes or so. It was a security guard and I talked to him and I thought, you know, I'll be out of here in a few minutes. And a little more and a little more time went by.

'I finally said I'm going to talk to the police, I talked to them, and I thought I would get out from the police very soon.

'Then I just kept waiting and waiting, so eventually I went to social media.'

He posted a picture of himself behind shutters inside the darkened store with the message: 'This is me locked inside a Waterstones bookstore in London.

'I was upstairs for 15 minutes and came down to all the lights out and door locked. Been here over an hour now. Supposedly someone is on their way.'

In a later post which was retweeted by more than 7,000 people, he wrote: 'Hi Waterstones, I've been locked inside of your Trafalgar Square bookstore for two hours now. Please let me out.'

When he was finally released, he wrote: 'I'm free.'

Twitter users were quick to offer Mr Willis assistance - with some telling him to call police, a few offering him food, and others giving book recommendations to help him pass the time.

Before he had been saved, journalist Gaby Hinsliff said: 'Need my bed but can barely sleep till I know the Waterstones One is free. Poor @DWill_. Hope they give him a book token to make up for it.'

Publisher Matt McAdam added: 'What would you do if you were locked in one of the world's great bookstores overnight? @DWill_ is finding out! @Waterstones.'

And web developer Tim Archer said: '@DWill_ @Waterstones tell them you'll be randomly moving the books until you are released, that should speed them up a bit.'

This morning Waterstones posted a blog on its website entitled 'What to read when you've two hours on your hands...and you are locked in a bookshop'.

Freedom: At 00.24am today, Mr Willis, of Dallas, Texas, posted to his relieved followers on Twitter: 'I'm free'

Despite the alarm sounding and despite calls to the police and security guard, Mr Willis paced for two hours

He's out: At 00.15am this morning, a tweet was posted on the company's account, saying: 'We're pleased to announce that @DWill_ [David Willis] is a free man once more. Thanks for your concern and tweets!'

He said it was 'eerie' inside the closed gallery. He spent around ten minutes wandering around the Tate before a security guard let him out.  

Help had eventually come from the Metropolitan Police, who rescued him at about 11.20pm last night.

A force spokesman told the Daily Mail: 'We were contacted to say that a man was trapped inside the branch of Waterstones in Trafalgar Square. He was released between 11.05pm and 11.20pm.'

Today, Mr Willis' plight was the subject of jokes on social media, with many other branches of the shop tweeting promising their customers they wouldn't lock them in and others suggesting what the Texan might have read.

Using the hashtag #WaterstonesTexan, Twitter user _markgallagher suggested his experiences might be turned into a film, starring Colin Firth as the store manager, Keira Knightly as the check-out assistant, and Hugh Grant as the 'hapless' security guard.

Some book lovers questioned why Mr Willis called for help at all, saying a night in a bookshop was too good an opportunity to miss, while others suggested alternatives - getting stuck in a chocolate factory or shop was a popular suggestion.
