The father of a British woman arrested
in Bali, allegedly part of international drugs syndicate, has visited 
his daughter in hospital taking a pillow and several bottles of water for her.

Paul Dougall went to see his daughter Rachel 
Dougall, 38, at Bhayangkara Trijata Hospital, in 
Denpasar, this afternoon.

He spent an hour talking with his 
daughter who was in a room specially built for prisoners at the 
police-owned hospital where she has been since June 1 when she collapsed
from a severe asthma attack.

His visit comes a couple of days after it emerged Dougall was 'keeping healthy' by eating meals from KFC.

She collapsed for a first time in her cell at Bali police headquarters and was put on an intravenous drip to help her recover.

However, when she collapsed a second 
time she said that spices from the hospital food were bringing about the
asthma attacks. Police and hospital workers then granted her request 
for a takeaway Western meal which a nurse picked up for her.

She was arrested arrest late last 
month under suspicion she and her 53-year-old partner, Julian Ponder, 
and two other Britons were part of an international drug-smuggling 
syndicate.

'She is making a good recovery now, 
said Dr Oka Semadi, who is paying daily visits to her as he makes other 
hospital rounds. 'Eating the food she asked for has helped her back to 
health.

'Once she is well enough we have to inform the police and we believe she will then be taken back to the police station.'

Questioning of Miss Dougall and the 
three other Britons - including 56-year-old Mrs Lindsay Sandiford, who 
is said to be 'telling all' about the alleged drug syndicate - could go 
on for weeks before a decision is made about bringing charges.

But police say they have a 'very 
strong case' and all four are expected to be charged with trafficking in
cocaine - a Class A drug - for which there is a mandatory death 
sentence by firing squad.

She, along with three other Britons 
including her partner Julian Ponder, face the death penalty after being 
arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle cocaine worth £1.6 million.

Police believe Dougall, 38, and 
Ponder, 43, were the lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug 
to rich tourists on the Indonesian island of Bali.  If convicted, they 
could be sentenced to death by firing squad.

Dougall's six-year-old daughter Kitty,
is currently being cared for by the family's maid and her gardening 
husband, although Dougall's parents are believed to be flying out from 
Britain.

Speaking from her guarded room at 
Bali's Trijata Hospital, Dougall appeared frail and confused as she 
asked if the story was in British newspapers.

When she was told it was, she said she feared for her daughter Kitty's life. Propping herself up on her elbow, she said: 'Oh my god, is my daughter safe?

'I am afraid for my daughter's life. I am sick. I am suffering from stress. My mother and father are arriving.'

A Bali police spokesperson earlier 
confirmed officers had been forced to stop questioning Ms Dougall 
temporarily due to her bad health.

'We don't interrogate sick people,' he
said. 'It will be against their human rights. We will be waiting until 
she is healthy again and then we will continue the questions.'

Dougall has consistently protested her innocence since her arrest, insisting she was the victim of a 'fit-up'.

The four suspects were held in a sting
operation after British housewife Lindsay Sandiford, 55, was allegedly 
caught with 4.8kg of cocaine stuffed in the lining of a suitcase after 
being stopped at Bali's Denpasar airport after she arrived from Bangkok 
on May 19.

Customs officials allegedly found 10.3lb of cocaine wrapped in pink gift paper.

Bali's head of Customs, Mr Made Wijaya, said: 'It was stupid. There had been no attempt to conceal it.'

He claimed that Sandiford had 
previously met up with Dougall in a Bangkok airport cafe. She had been 
given a sim card for her mobile phone and that Sandiford made a 'dry 
run' a few days before she was found with the drugs.

Starved: Reports have said she did not eat anything for more than five days

He said: 'She came into Bali on  May 5
and left a few days later. Then she came in on May 19, which is when 
she was arrested. I believe she only did this because she was forced 
to.'

Referring to Dougall, he said: 'She 
ordered the drugs. She organised this. Rachel was telling Lindsay what 
to do. Rachel made the first contact with Lindsay.'

It is believed Sandiford decided to co-operate with the police over a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice.

They told her she would face the death penalty unless she helped trap the other suspected members of the drugs gang.

A sting was set up allowing Sandiford 
to keep the drugs with her in a £25-a-night hotel room, where she was 
accompanied by an undercover police officer while she waited to be 
contacted by one of the others in the alleged syndicate.

Police claim Ponder turned up at the 
hotel while another Briton, Paul Beales, whom they believe was the 
gang's 'muscle', waited nearby.

Ponder has alleged that he was set up by Sandiford as he went to pick up a birthday present for his daughter.

Dougall and Ponder's plush Bali villa 
was built on 17,222 sq ft of land bought in 2009 — the year after Mr 
Ponder's UK-based party-organising business was liquidated with huge 
debts.

The luxurious property is worth at 
least $300,000 (£195,000) on the local market — a small fortune in 
Indonesia, where the minimum wage is about £100 a month.

It is located in the village of Desa 
Belalang in Tabanan, about an hour's drive from Bali's main tourist 
areas. The couple began living here with their daughter a few months 
ago. The couple are also believed to own a property in Cyprus.

The Foreign Office said British officials were helping Dougall's daughter as well as the arrested Britons.

Suspect: Paul Beales, right, has also been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking

A spokesman said it did not have any information regarding the reports that Dougall had been taken to hospital.

Customs officials have said that 
Sandiford, originally from Redcar, Teesside, may be spared the death 
sentence because she helped catch three other members of the smuggling 
operation, who could face a firing squad.

Police have 60 days before they have 
to hand over their files to prosecutors, it is believed Sandiford is 
thought to have told police she only agreed to make the smuggling trip 
because her children in England were being threatened.

If the four are found guilty, they 
will be transferred to the notorious Kerobokan jail, or Hotel K as it is
chillingly known, where up to 11 prisoners at a time are forced to 
share single cells. There are currently 90 inmates awaiting execution at
'Hotel K.'
