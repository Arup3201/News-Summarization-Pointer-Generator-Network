Fat fighters: Plymouth is having to open a third obesity clinic to deal with the waiting list backlog as so many people are morbidly overweight

A British city has been forced to expand its obesity provision because its specialist clinics can't cope with ever-growing waiting lists.

Some residents in Plymouth, Devon, have waited as long as ten months to be seen at one of its two current NHS centres.

One in four adults are obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30, while around 4,000 are in the morbidly overweight category, according to government figures.

The NHS weight management programme in Devonport has a waiting list of 198 people, 64 of whom have waited over the target 18 weeks - the longest for 44 weeks.

The programme treats morbidly obese adults.

The category covers patients with a body mass index (BMI) above 40, putting them at high risk of suffering serious health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.

It has been estimated there are about 4,000 morbidly obese people in Plymouth.

Health bosses said the number of clinics will be increased from two to three in April, with a view to dealing with the backlog by July and funding has been agreed for extra staff and training.

Sarah Hind, who leads the weight management programme, said: 'The aim is to help people make small changes to their lifestyles over the two-year course which can all add up to becoming more active, eating and enjoying food in a balanced way and very often feeling much more positive.'

She added: 'Losing weight and changing old habits is hard work but the little things can really help.

'This is not a quick fix it is about making changes for life. But when participants do commit the results can be amazing.'

The weight-management programme in Plymouth was launched in 2006.

There has always been high demand for the service. In 2009, the waiting list was suspended as it reached 332 people.

The programme concentrates on diet, exercise and psychology.Patients are referred by their GP.

Each programme has around 15 participants and is split into three phases.

The first lasts for 10 weeks and looks at how to be active, meal planning and portion sizes, understanding habits and how to make changes.

Phase two, which is fortnightly for two months, supports people to look at barriers to change and help them to continue healthier habits.

The third and final phase continues over the following year. It aims to help people stay on track with sessions every month for the first six months and then every two months after that.

It is predicted that by 2025, nearly half of men and over a third of women nationally will be obese.

Plymouth Community Healthcare is the social enterprise which took over the running of community health services from NHS Plymouth in October.

Anyone worried about weight affecting their health should contact their GP for advice.
