EL James has launched a higher-end line of bondage gear at posh sex shop Coco De Mer with sister company Lovehoney.

Called the Fifty Shades of Grey Red Room Collection, it features several spanking tools such as a riding crop, flogger, paddle and cane all in a premium brown leather.

And the famed author, 51, has said the did a lot of research when it came to perfecting the range.

The range is crafted from luxury brown leather and includes wrist cuffs, £100 (l) and a flogger, £90 (r)

It's being sold at Coco de Mer - London's most luxurious erotic emporium - on Monmouth Street

She said at an event launch this week: 'I don't really like to talk about my sex life. I have a child at school so I don't want to mention what I get up to. But I did a lot of research.'

Starting at £40 and going up to £100, James' latest line is a far cry form her first sex prop collection with Lovehoney back in October 2012.

The 15-piece range started at just £11.99 and came in a shimmering silver material; the sort suitable for hen party gifts.

Appealing to an altogether more affluent customer, which matches its home of Coco de Mer - which has an unrivalled reputation as London's most luxurious erotic emporium, the Red Room Collection is certainly taking the brand up a notch.

With just ten pieces, it's more considered and each one is finely crafted; but it's certainly not for the faint hearted.

A blindfold, wrist cuffs, ankle cuffs, spreader bar, mouth gag and hog tie complete the range.

EL James said: 'The Lovehoney guys (co-owners Richard Longhurst and Neal Slateford) are such a pleasure to work with. They have got a great sense of humour and they really get the Fifty Shades brand.' 

Richard Longhurst, co-founder of Lovehoney, commented: 'This luxury range of leather bondage equipment is inspired by what Christian Grey has in the Red Room in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie and has been designed with author E L James. It's the real deal for anyone who wants to recreate the scenes that they're going to see in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. It's a collection truly fit for a billionaire.'

Lovehoney and sister company Coco de Mer are listed as official suppliers to the legendary Red Room in the film's credits.

'As manufacturers of the only official Fifty Shades of Grey Pleasure Products we were delighted to supply Universal with products for the Red Room,' said Longhurst. 

All the items come with luxury branded dust bags and leather tags, available from the Coco de Mer boutique and www.coco-de-mer.com
