With his team struggling in the playoffs, the New York Yankees' highest-paid benchwarmer Alex Rodriguez was certainly not feeling the pressure as he flirted with two women in the stands.

One of them clearly caught A-Rod's attention at at time when Yankee fans would have preferred he be more focused on baseball.

The third baseman, who has been called out numerous times over the years for failing to hit when it matters the most, traded his terrible batting average for another set of digits on Saturday night.

The New York Post identified the object of A-Rod's affection as Kyna Treacy, a 33-year-old Australian model sitting right behind the Yankees dugout with friend and fellow Aussie Kate Quinn.

Rodriguez reportedly got her phone number before the Yankees fell to the Detroit Tigers in the first game of the American League Championship Series.

Ms Treacy, who lives in New York, also owns her own bikini line - Kini Bikini.

In 2009, she donned a striped two-piece in a commercial for Air Pacific.

The free-swinging slugger tried to chat up the women after he was pulled 
from Saturday’s game against the Detroit Tigers in the eighth inning 
with the Yankees down 4-0.

And while Ms Treacy appears charmed by A-Rod, she may be alone, as fans, the New York media and Yankees manager Joe Girardi have had enough.

The three-time American League MVP was benched for last night's loss to the Tigers.

His failure to produce at the plate has been exacerbated by his recent loverboy antics and cavalier attitude.

Even mouthy real estate mogul Donald Trump couldn’t resist taking a few jabs, posting Twitter musings that called A-Rod a ‘$30m/yr rip off’ and that 'it was only drugs that made him great.'

He was referring to Rodriguez's 2009 admission that he took performance-enhancing drugs while he played with the Texas Rangers.

A-Rod, who has two children with ex-wife Cynthia, has dated Kate Hudson, Madonna, Cameron Diaz and WWE wrestler Torrie Wilson.

Rodriguez didn’t talk to reporters as we he walked onto the field for pregame warm-ups last night, but wore a big smile on his face as he laughed and joked around with teammates.

In the dugout, A-Rod smirked, waved and mouthed 'hi mom' when TV cameras were fixed on him.

It’s clear that Rodriguez, 37, is not the dangerous hitter he once was, and with another five years and $114million left on his contract, the Yankees may be suffering from buyer’s remorse.
