A 37-year-old Missouri woman has been charged with having illegal sex with a 15-year-old girl and helping her ex-convict boyfriend dispose of her body last year in Truman Lake.

Court documents unsealed last week show that Amy Leigh Hartley, 37, of Buffalo, faces charges of statutory sodomy, tampering with physical evidence and abandonment of a corpse.

The felony complaint shows she also is charged with endangering the welfare of a child by allowing the teen, Khighla Parks, in her ‘uninhabitable’ home, where methamphetamine was made and used ‘to engage in sex with multiple partners, some of whom were known by the defendant to engage in asphyxiation sex.’

Tragic end: Khighla Parks, 15, who was Facebook friends with Balbirne, was reported missing on September 20, 2012, and was discovered dead in a lake 10 days later

After Parks’ September 2012 death, Hartley helped move the teen's body, according to the complaint. Hartley also is accused of washing bedding in an effort to thwart investigators.

Anthony Balbirnie, a man described in court documents as Hartley's on-again, off-again boyfriend, has been charged with second-degree murder, statutory rape, child molestation, endangering the welfare of a child, tampering with physical evidence and abandonment of a corpse.

A special prosecutor filed the charges against Balbirnie this month after the county prosecutor dropped a count alleging that he abandoned the corpse of Miss Parks. 

Balbirnie, 48, of Springfield, is incarcerated at the state prison in Bowling Green, where he is serving time for violating parole.

Investigators believe Parks, a high school sophomore who loved horseback riding, met with Hartley and Balbirnie at the woman's home at 810 Locust Street in Buffalo on September 21, 2012.

After engaging in sexual activities with the couple, which allegedly involved asphyxiation, the 15-year-old girl died.

Gruesome find: A boatman came upon Parks' corpse with weights attached to it in Truman Lake

Police say Balbirnie took Parks' body, weighted it down and dumped it in Truman Lake, where it was discovered by a boater September 30.

Hartley, who reportedly suffers from a brain injury sustained during a 2008 car accident, told police that her boyfriend helped wrap Parks' body and stuffed it in the trunk of a car and drove off en route to Truman Lake.

Bizarre: Balbirnie, whose Facebook account features a mask with a swastika on it, has a long rap sheet containing multiple drug charges

Harlety faces up to 29 years in prison if convicted, Ozarks First reported. She is being held on $75,000 bond. 

Another man, Larry Warner, is listed as a co-defendant in the charging documents, but investigators are keeping mum on his alleged role in the case.

Probable cause documents containing further details on the girl’s death and evidence against the suspects have been sealed by a judge at the request of the state attorney general, who cited safety concern to witnesses, the Springfield News-Leader said.

Parks, who was Facebook friends with Balbirnie, was reported missing on September 20 after she left her grandparents' home in Willard to go for a walk.

She was last seen alive at a party in Buffalo, Missouri with a crowd of people, around 40 miles away.

The girl's grandmother Bonnie Adams told KY3: 'She had taken off a few days, went to a friend's house or something like that, so I gave her the 24 hours.

Balbirnie was released from prison on parole in August 2012 after serving 15 months for possessing marijuana, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections.

He was on probation for convictions in 2010 for unlawful use of weapons, manufacturing a controlled substance and resisting arrest with the intent to cause physical harm or death by fleeing.

The 48-year-old has a long history of criminal charges from drug possession to resisting arrest.

Life lost: Parks was a high school sophomore who loved horses and was a member of a riding group

Balbirnie's long-inactive Facebook page features a profile picture of a mask with a swastika on the forehead. He describes himself as 'outgoing and energetic, likes to take long walks in the woods'.

He was named a suspect in an attempted abduction in 2006 when a 16-year-old girl was allegedly taken against her will from a hotel room.

The teen was later returned home and no charges were filed agaisnt Balbirnie because the girl allegedly told him she was 17 years old.
