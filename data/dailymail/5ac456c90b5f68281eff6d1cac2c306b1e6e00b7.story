Senegal are determined to keep hold of West Ham striker Diafra Sakho in the face of competition from France.

Sakho has enjoyed a sensational start to his career in England, scoring seven goals in as many starts since arriving from Metz.

The 24-year-old has played twice for Senegal but is yet to feature in a competitive fixture for the African nation meaning he is still eligible to switch allegiances.

Sakho qualifies for Les Bleus as he was a French resident from 2007 following his move to Metz ahead of joining the Hammers.

His performances for West Ham have alerted France manager Didier Deschamps.

But Senegal manager Alain Giresse, having handed the forward his international debut in a friendly against Burkina Faso in May, wants to keep Sakho from France's clutches.

And Giresse is considering handing Sakho, provided he overcomes a shoulder injury in time, his first ever competitive appearance in the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Egypt and Botswana in an attempt to secure his long-term international future.

Sakho's form this season means that both Senegal and France are interested in securing his services
