Newsreels showing the Duchess of Cambridge's great-great-great uncle greeting Prince William's ancestor has been uncovered.

The British Pathe footage taken in 1927 shows Sir Charles Lupton, the lord mayor of Leeds, and his wife Isabella greeting the Queen's aunt Princess Mary.

Even earlier newsreels of Sir Charles visiting the Leeds Pals Battalion in the Yorkshire Dales during the First World War have also been found.

Princess Mary was in Leeds to inaugurate a girls' week campaign for Hunslet Young Women's Christian Association.

In the footage from 1915 Sir Charles, wearing his chain of office, bowler hat, suit and overcoat, inspects the soldiers accompanied by an officer, and in one shot is followed by a large entourage.

He was joined by his three brothers, Arthur, Hugh and Kate's great-great grandfather Francis Lupton.

Both Francis and Sir Charles were Trinity College Cambridge academics.

It is not known which man in the entourage was Francis but his name was noted down by the original cameraman.

Alastair
 White, general manager of British Pathe, said: 'We often get contacted 
by visitors to our website who are thrilled to find films of their 
ancestors, their close family or even themselves as youngsters.

'We
 knew we had many films of Prince William's family, but it was a real 
surprise to find that we also have the Duchess of Cambridge's ancestors 
and that they were meeting royalty.'

Hugh Lupton followed in his brother's footsteps and also became lord mayor of Leeds.

Fashions might have changed since the 
1920s but royal visits remain largely the same, and the Princess was 
given a large bouquet of flowers as she left and her entourage drove off
 in chauffeur-driven limousines.

Links to the Lupton family were discovered by history teacher Michael Reed and his pupils in Australia in April this year during a class project.

Sir Charles was the founder of the world's largest law firm DLA Piper.

The class assignment also revealed that the Duchess' second cousin - thrice removed - is Newnham College graduate Lady Barbara Bullock.

Mr Reed traced the Duchess's family line back five generations to the Marquess of Lansdowne and his brother Thomas FitzMaurice who lived at the Buckinghamshire stately home Cliveden with his wife Mary, 4th Countess of Orkney in the late 18th century.
