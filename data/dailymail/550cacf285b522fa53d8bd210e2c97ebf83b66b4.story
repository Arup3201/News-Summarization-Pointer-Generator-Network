A woman named Cameo Crispi tried to set her ex-boyfriend's home on fire by burning a pound of bacon, police have said.

The 31-year-old mother from Uintah County, Utah was arrested on March 14 and has been charged with arson.

Her arrest came after her ex-boyfriend called Naples police to say that he had received numerous phone calls and texts from Crispi in just an hour and wanted her to stop, charging documents said.

Caught: Cameo Crispi, left in her mug shot and right on Facebook, has been accused of trying to set her ex's home on fire by leaving a pound of bacon on the stove and scattering hot coals on the floor

Speaking with officers, he also said that he did not want her at his house.

When an officer went to the home, he found Crispi there and noted she was drunk. He also saw smoke coming out of the front door, the Deseret News reported.

'I asked to come in and observed a wood stove left open with a fire burning inside and hot coals on the floor around the stove,' the officer wrote.

He also found a cookie sheet covered with a pound of bacon sitting on top of the stove.

'I observed the burner to be on the setting "High" and the bacon to be severely burned and smoking badly,' the officer wrote.

Mother: Crispi, who as allegedly drunk when she was arrested at her ex's home, is pictured with her son

Together: Crispi is pictured last November with a man she calls 'the love of my life'. The ex she allegedly targeted in the arson attempt has not been identified by police

The officer stopped the fire and arrested Crispi.

A test found that she had a blood-alcohol content of 0.346 and she was taken to the hospital for a medical clearance before being booked into jail, the charging documents state.

'The doctor asked her about the fireâ€¦ and she stated she was attempting to start a fire in the house to get back at (her ex-boyfriend),' the charges state.

Crispi is also charged with burglary, assault by a prisoner, interfering with an arresting officer, electronic communication harassment and intoxication.

She is due in court on April 14.
