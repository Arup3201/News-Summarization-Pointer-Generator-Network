A generous customer has paid $1,000 to pick up the tab for diners in dozens of vehicles at the drive-thru lanes of a West Texas fast-food restaurant.

KTXS-TV reported the man was in a white truck at a Chick-fil-A in Abilene on Monday night when he gave the money to the restaurant.

The man 'told employees he wanted to pay for everyone in the drive-thru line behind him' for as long as the cash lasted,' the affiliate station reported.

Giving: Brian LaCroix said the donor, who is reportedly named John 'paid for 88 cars in a little over an hour'

Donor: A man was in a white truck at a Chick-fil-A in Abilene, pictured, on Monday night when he gave $1000 to the restaurant and paid for others' meals 

KXTS-TV reported that the man told workers that his name is John, he just wanted 'to make everyone's Monday better,' the station said, and gave away 10 bills worth $1000.

'One lady actually cried because she had a really tough day,' Duste Wolf, an employee at the fast food chain, told the affiliate station. 'She had a lot of bad stuff happen to her.'

Wolf told WPTV, 'I asked him, 'did you win the lottery today like why are you doing this?' He was like 'Monday's are tough and I want to make everyone have a good day, like I just want to help them have a good day.'

Employee: Dust Wolfe, pictured, said a female cried after learning her meal was one of many paid for by 'John' 

The franchise owner, Brian LaCroix, told KXTS 'He paid for 88 cars in a little over an hour. He pretty much bought everyone's meal in the drive-thru for a little over an hour.'

The donor's identity remains unknown.

Customer Barry Taylor told WPTV 'We need to think about other people, not just ourselves and putting a little bit of joy in someone's life unexpectedly is a real blessing.'
