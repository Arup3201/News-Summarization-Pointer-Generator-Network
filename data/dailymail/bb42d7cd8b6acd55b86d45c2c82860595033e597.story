Emily Colbourne drove her children to school while over the drink drive limit, and has been banned from the road - after her husband reported her to police

A woman who drove her children to school while over the drink drive limit has been banned from the road - after her husband reported her to police.

Emily Colbourne, 33, got into an argument with her husband Stuart when she returned home from the pub in Henfield, West Sussex, later than expected.

The mother-of-four fell asleep, but when she woke up the next day  the couple - who are still together - continued to argue. 

Worthing Magistrates' Court heard that her husband took their two youngest children – both under three years of age – to nursery.

Meanwhile his wife took the two eldest children to school in Upper Beeding.

Martina Sherlock, defending, said Colbourne was eager to get her children to school and out of the frosty atmosphere at home.

But once she had left the house to take the children - aged eight and 11 - to school, police received the phone call claiming she was over the drink drive limit.

Colbourne was spotted coming out of a shop and getting into her car before driving. 

The court was told that she had already dropped the children  at their school.

She was pulled over by a firearms team in the area and arrested.

After being taken into police custody, it was found that Colbourne was one and half times over the drink drive limit. She gave a reading of 57/100, exceeding the legal limit to drive of 35.

Ms Sherlock said: 'She would never put her children at risk. She would never do that.

'She was anxious to make sure her children got to school despite the tensions going on at home.'

She also asked why her husband had not stopped her from driving if he knew she was over the limit, instead of informing the police.

Colbourne, of Henfield, West Sussex, was banned from driving for 36 months. She was also fined £110 and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £20.

When asked by magistrates whether she could pay any of the fine, Ms Colbourne said: 'I don't have any credit cards or anything. I'm bankrupt.'

The court was told the fines would come out of the combined income of the couple, who are still together.

The Express reports that Colbourne was the first person to be charged by Sussex Police in its Christmas drink-driving crackdown.

At the time, Colbourne said: 'I, like many other people, truly believed I was legally allowed and safe to drive.

'I really hope others realise that it is not enough to rely on a night's sleep and breakfast to be under the legal drink-drive limit.

'My mistake has caused enough upset for our family to cope and deal with.

'I am in no way condoning driving over the limit or making excuses but, if my actions save another parent or person making the same mistake at least some good will have come out of it.'
