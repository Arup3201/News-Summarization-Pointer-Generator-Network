Madeleine McCann’s parents say the ‘pieces of the jigsaw’ are  fitting together in the investigation to solve the mystery of their daughter’s disappearance after the discovery of fresh ‘substantive’ evidence.

Kate and Gerry McCann’s comments yesterday came as detectives revealed they have ‘the most complete picture to date’ of what happened when Madeleine, then aged three, went missing in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on the night of May 3, 2007.

Scotland Yard, which in July launched a new full inquiry into the disappearance of Madeleine, says it has discovered new material  after trawling through mobile phone calls made by people in the resort in the days before she vanished.

Crimewatch: A new appeal will be launched later this month to find missing Madeleine McCann

The breakthrough will be revealed in a Crimewatch TV special due to be shown on October 14 as part of a fresh appeal for information.

Kate and Gerry, who will feature in the show, said they were ‘greatly encouraged’ by the new evidence.

In a joint statement, they said: ‘We are really hopeful the forthcoming appeal on Crimewatch will bring further new evidence which will take us a step closer to finding Madeleine and to bringing those responsible for her abduction to justice.’

In the programme, police will outline a new theory they say will give a ‘different understanding’ about the case.

Detective Inspector Andy Redwood, the senior investigating officer, said: ‘We believe we have the most complete picture to date of the events surrounding her disappearance.

'We are making targeted and new appeals for help from the public. I believe there are people out there who hold the key to Madeleine’s disappearance, and that so far they may be unaware of that fact.

‘Through this latest round of  publicity we hope to take the next step forward. There is a huge public desire to help us.’

Hopeful: Kate McCann is encouraged by Scotland Yard's findings

The log of mobile phone traffic analysed by Scotland Yard is made up of thousands of calls from people who live in 31 countries.

As a result, detectives have contacted police forces across the world to identify anyone who was at the Portuguese resort when Madeleine went missing.

Officers have established that  the majority of holidaymakers in the resort were from the UK, Ireland, Holland and Germany.

As a result, the TV special will be aired on British, German and Dutch television.

It will feature an interview with the McCanns, while highlighting new leads uncovered by police.

The programme will also feature  a reconstruction of events in the  Portuguese resort on the night Madeleine disappeared.

However, Kate and Gerry have banned the re-enactment of their daughter’s disappearance from  taking place in Portugal through fear of angering the country’s police.

Instead they have allowed filming to go ahead in neighbouring Spain, with actors playing the roles of the anguished couple.

A three-year-old child actress, bearing a striking similarity to their daughter, will double as Madeleine.

Crimewatch editor Joe Mather said: ‘We are very hopeful this major reconstruction, along with the substantial new lines of enquiry, will prompt viewers with vital information to get in touch with officers in the studio.’
