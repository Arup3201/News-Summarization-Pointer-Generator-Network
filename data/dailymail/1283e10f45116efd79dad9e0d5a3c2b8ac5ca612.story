Gordon Gallagher was killed after he tripped upon the Republican-made bomb

The IRA finally apologised yesterday for the death of a nine-year-old boy after blaming the British Army for almost 40 years.

Gordon Gallagher was killed after he tripped upon the Republican-made bomb while playing ‘Cowboys and Indians’ with his brother in their garden in Londonderry in 1973.

Doctors tried to save his life by amputating both of his legs, but he died from the injuries caused by the booby-trapped device.

Gordon’s parents have previously 
claimed IRA members visited them days after his death and told them they
 placed the bomb without a detonator and it was added by the British 
Army to try and ‘frame’ them for the killing.

But
 yesterday the IRA confessed to planting both the bomb and the detonator
 after Gordon’s family called upon Sinn Fein politician Martin 
McGuinness to tell them who put it in the children’s play area and why.

McGuinness was a former IRA commander in Londonderry at the time and the statement was made on the eve of the 39th anniversary of Gordon’s death.

The IRA statement said the group accepted responsibility and was ‘truly remorseful and profoundly sorry’. It also offered its apologies ‘for the pain and grief caused’.

It has issued similar admissions and apologies over the past 15 years for killings that it long denied committing and sometimes falsely attributed to the British Army.

Gordon’s father Billy said yesterday the IRA statement represented a major U-turn from the group’s 1973 position but it still wasn’t good enough.

‘I am glad they take full responsibility and accept that they were to blame and no one else was,’ he said.

But he said McGuinness still should be able to provide his family much more detailed information on who did it and why.

Asked about the IRA’s initial claim of the British Army’s involvement, he added: ‘I never believed that for a second.’

Sinn Fein in a statement said McGuinness was in a Republic of Ireland prison in 1973 and so couldn’t help the family.

McGuinness - who since 2007 has been deputy leader of Northern Ireland’s government - has repeatedly said he will never provide anyone information on individual IRA members’ involvement in bombings and shootings.

Londonderry was predominantly Catholic and the second-largest city in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s.

The IRA had several hundred members trying to ambush police and British soldiers, often in the Gallagher’s home area of Creggan, during fierce fighting.

Soldiers investigating the blast found a second booby-trap bomb nearby that appeared to have been placed in hopes of catching troops responding to the first explosion.
