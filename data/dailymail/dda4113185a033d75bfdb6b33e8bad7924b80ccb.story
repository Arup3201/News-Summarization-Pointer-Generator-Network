Manchester City ace Yaya Toure has named former Barcelona team-mates Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta as two players he would rather play with than against.

Toure, who will miss his side's Champions League clash against Barcelona due to suspension, played alongside Messi and Iniesta during his three-year spell at the Nou Camp.

The Ivorian international also put fellow Manchester City stars Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany in the same bracket as well as Paris Saint-Germain defender Thiago Silva.

When asked to name five players he would rather play with than against, Toure replied: ‘[Lionel] Messi. [Sergio] Aguero as well. Fantastic player!

'And in the midfield, I would like to play with [Andres] Iniesta as well. Defender, Thiago Silva, love him. I have a lot of players, but [Vincent] Kompany as well is very good, strong and very difficult to play against.

'I am very happy to play with him, as to play against [him] I think is difficult.’
