France's President Francois Hollande became the first major Western leader to visit an Ebola-affected region since the outbreak began - but with the aid of a horde of bodyguards.

Hollande, who was greeted on his arrival to Guinea by President Alpha Conde, pledged that France would set an example by providing aid to countries stricken by the disease.

He is the first Western leader to visit one of the three worst affected west African countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

More than 5,700 people have been killed in the worst known outbreak of Ebola in history.

In Guinea, 1,260 people have died from Ebola out of 2,134 cases of infection. 

He told his hosts 'we are together with you in the struggle' and 'we have a duty to support you' ahead of a visit to an Ebola hospital.  

Speaking to reporters at Conakry airport, he said: 'France wants to set an example. Beyond material help, it is human help which is the most important.'

He added he he had come to 'deliver a message of hope.'

He will travel to neighbouring Senegal later for a summit of French-speaking nations in Dakar.

Guinea's President Alpha Omar Conde also has his temperature measured upon his arrival  at Donka Hospital

He promised that during the conference in the Senegalese capital, he will call for an international mobilisation' against the disease.  

France has pledged 100 million euros ($125 million) as a contribution to the fight against Ebola, focusing its efforts on Guinea, its former colony.

The money is to be used to help with financing several care centres as well as 200 beds, some of which are reserved for health workers caring for the sick.

France has also pledged to set up two training centres for health workers, one in France and one in Guinea. In addition, French biotechnology companies will set up rapid diagnostic tests in Africa.  

Other Western nations are also ramping up their support.

The US is deploying up to 3,000 troops, mostly in Liberia, while Britain has sent military staff to build treatments centres in Sierra Leone. 

Locals cheer towards the motorcade carrying President Hollande through Guinea's capital, Conakry

President Conde said the arrival of French president Hollande, whose cavalcade through Conakry brought out locals to cheer him (pictured), was 'a very, very important sign ... it means everyone can come to Guinea'

President Conde said Hollande's visit sent an important message.

'For the people of Guinea, the arrival of President Hollande is a very, very important sign.

'If the president of a country as important as France can come to Guinea, that means everyone can come to Guinea.' 

Conde's government has made some progress in controlling the outbreak.

However, aid workers have said that local resistance to help is hampering efforts to curb the spread in rural areas. 

Guinea will be the focus of trials by British-funded researchers on a 15-minute Ebola test, the Wellcome Trust and UK government announced today.
