FEMAIL were keen to discover the secrets behind Millie's beauty look so we chatted to her new favourite make-up artist, Nikki Wolff, who created the star's look last night.

Get the look: Last night at the Harper's Bazaar Women Of The Year Awards in London, Millie Mackintosh looked flawless. FEMAIL chatted to her make-up artist to get the secrets behind her look

Millie, a trained make-up artist herself, knows a good beauty buff when she sees one. The pair were introduced via mutual friend, Zara Martin. 

'I was doing Zara's makeup for a shoot and she posted a picture of her look on Instagram. Millie spotted it and asked her who did her make-up and then we were introduced and have been working together ever since. Millie calls me as and when she needs her make-up doing now.'

Nikki, who is also Jessica Ennis' make-up artist and works with Amanda Holden, wanted to create a really fresh, nude look on the star.

'Her Julien Macdonald dress was beautiful so we wanted to create a natural look to go with it,' she explained.

Millie is a postergirl for the healthy lifestyle she preaches - and Nikki says she can credit it for her glowing skin.

'Millie eats really well and exercises a lot, which really shows in her skin. I didn't want to mask her face with make-up but simply enhance her skin.'

Nikki prepared Millie's face with a Sisley face mask to hydrate it, followed by an Illamasqua skin base buffed in to create a 'second skin'.

Nikki used cream blusher because she believes it gives a glow from within rather than a cakey look. She followed this with a swish of highlighter (and no bronzer).

'Millie already has lovely glowing skin from her recent holiday so she didn't need any help,' she said.

Her natural peachy lips were created thanks to a chunky lip liner smudged over her lips with a slick of balm on top. 'I love using a liner as a lipstick or using it under a lipstick, which really makes it last longer,' said Nikki.

Hot couple: Millie arrived at the bash with husband Professor Green, who couldn't keep his eyes off her all night

For her eyes, the beauty guru used a soft brown kohl and completed the look with a set of lashes from Millie's eponymous range.

Beauty guru Millie says that she's respectful to Stephen when it comes to storing her makeup.

'I have to be fair to Stephen, and so I keep it organised and out of the way, under our bed in pull out drawers – face, lips, and lashes,' she explained.

Keen to build up her brand, Millie is considering venturing into beauty. 'I love discovering the next big thing in beauty and I am definitely looking into it but I'm so busy at the moment.

'It would be a range of make-up combined with skincare,' she added.
