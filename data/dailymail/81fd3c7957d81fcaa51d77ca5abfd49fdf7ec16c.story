A popular California high school cheerleader died only months after being diagnosed with lung cancer.

Sandra Martinez, a 16-year-old junior at Azusa High School, passed away March 6 when her family took her off a life support machine.

The problems started in January when she complained to her mother of shortness of breath while cheering during a January basketball game, according to KABC.

A bright future: Martinez was an honor roll student

The concerned mother immediately took her to a local hospital where the honor roll student found out she had a seven-inch cancerous tumor on her lungs.

She died last week only two months later.

‘She was surrounded by family and went peacefully. Our family would like to thank everyone for their prayers and support as well as ask for privacy during this time,’ her family posted to Facebook.

Her death came just over one month after she was sedated to stem her suffering from complications of the aggressive tumor, according to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.

One of the teen’s lungs collapsed due to internal bleeding from an attempted biopsy, according to KABC.

Martinez’s passing also came only days before her school was set to hold a benefit to help her family pay for the mounting medical bills.

‘My heartaches so much. God you have taken another beautiful cousin of ours,’ a family member wrote on Facebook.

Beloved: Martinez was a well-liked and popular student at Azusa High School

‘I can't begin to express the sorrow in my heart for your, our, loss. My condolences,’ another person wrote.

The popular student held a 4.5 grade point average and was well-liked among her peers, according to Principal Ramiro Rubalcaba.

‘We are all going to feel her loss,’ Rubalcaba told the Tribune. ‘She will be in our hearts forever.’

An online fundraising drive raised more than $11,000 to help Martinez’s family pay her medical bills, but that still won’t bring her back.

‘My dear Sandra there are no words to express the heart ache of losing you,’ another relative wrote on Facebook. ‘Although we may be comforted with the fact that you are now at rest peacefully, we will always miss you.’
