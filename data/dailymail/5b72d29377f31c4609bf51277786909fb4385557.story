Liverpool's chances of toppling Manchester United on March 16 have been boosted by the news that Lucas Leiva is returning to fitness.

The dogged midfielder has been sidelined by a cruciate knee ligament injury but will be back in action on Friday evening as part of the Under 21s squad who face West Ham on Friday.

Lucas picked up the injury in the 2-2 draw against Aston Villa in January and will hope to be fit for the crunch clash at Old Trafford next weekend.

Another first-team star who will also be involved as he returns from injury is Mamadou Sakho.

The 23-year-old Frenchman hasn't played for the Reds since injuring his hamstring in December during the 2-1 defeat by Chelsea.

Brendan Rodgers' side have emerged as outside contenders for the Premier League title, having leapfrogged Manchester City into third last weekend.

Liverpool will be desperate to complete the double over United, who they beat 1-0 at Anfield earlier this season, to strengthen their title bid and widen the gap between themselves and their bitter rivals.
