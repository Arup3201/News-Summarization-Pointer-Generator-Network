Criminal gangs are washing stolen bank notes in their homes in a bid to foil anti-theft technology.  

Detectives believe crooks in Greater Manchester are hand-washing cash bundles which have been stained with anti-theft 'SmartWater' dye to avoid detection.

The luminous pigment is used to protect cash deliveries, covering notes with invisible and traceable dye in the event of a violent theft.

However, police can still detect the hi-tech dye using special equipment - enabling them to link dirty cash to the crooks who took it.

Officers involved in recent raids in Greater Manchester were ordered to seize any suspicious items and clothing, including irons, which may have been used to flatten the washed notes, as well as examine water pipes for traces of the pigment, which they believe they can link to cash-in-transit robberies. 

It is alleged that the gang had attempted to get rid of the 'laundered' money through bookmakers, many of whom have now been alerted to the scam. 

The discovery was made as officers made raids to bring down an armed gang from Salford who were among the first to be targeted in a crackdown on Greater Manchester's most wanted criminals.

The warrants come as part of Operation Olympus, a force-wide month long crackdown to catch every suspect on GMP's list of sought-after crooks. 

Anti-theft dye is released from a dye-pack, a device invented as a way to non-violently render a bank robbery pointless.

The dye permanently stains the stolen money a bright red color, alerting everyone to the fact that the money being passed to them is stolen.

In most cases, a dye pack is placed in a hollowed-out space within a stack of banknotes and is virtually indistinguishable.

Bank tellers have several of these packs near their station at all times. A pack is put in 'safe' mode by attaching it to a special magnetic plate. 

During a robbery, a teller tries to slip one of the dye packs into the money bag without the thief noticing. While the thief is still inside the bank, the dye pack remains dormant. Within the dye package is a small radio receiver that is activated when the pack is removed from the magnetic plate. 

A small radio transmitter is mounted inside or near the door frame of all entrances of the bank. 

Once the dye pack passes through the door and receives the specific radio frequency signal, it activates. 

The dye pack is usually set on a timer of 10 seconds or longer so that the criminal is either in his getaway car or running a good distance from the bank before the package explodes.

Unlike traditional anti-theft dye, SmartWater dye is invisible and has a unique chemical signature that can link stolen notes to a specific crime scene. 

The revolutionary liquid is the brainchild of former policemen Phil Cleary. 

The robbery investigation, codenamed Freefall, was sparked following the theft of a motorbike. 

Yesterday morning, officers from the tactical aid unit attended five addresses in Salford arresting three suspected members of the gang. 

Detectives believe criminal gangs may even be hand-washing stolen bank notes stained with so-called Smart Water dye. 

Officers thoroughly searched the properties, including the water pipes for evidence that the gang had been trying to wash the hi-tech dye from plundered cash. 

In Higher Broughton, officers raided two properties - arresting one man. 

As part of their investigation, police studied CCTV footage of three seperate robberies at filling stations  to identify the suspects.

In one, on Waterloo Road, in September, two men armed with a hammer threatened the cashier, stealing cigarettes.

Det Con Laurence Elliot said: 'They even had the nerve to tell the people who were filling up to get going or they'd batter them.' 

At Morrisons, the robbers drove into the filling station in a Ford Connect van fitted with false plates. 

The driver stayed in the vehicle while his accomplice, armed with a machete, attacked the security guard, kicking him to the ground. 

He can be seen on CCTV footage dragging the security guard across the ground and allegedly threatening to cut his face off. 

The gang is also believed to have targeted a jewellers in Manchester Road making off with a large amount of gold. 

Det Con Sean Loughlin said: 'We are here to target a nasty group of individuals who have been targeting businesses in a violent way. 

'For the past few months they have been causing mayhem everywhere from post offices to garages using machetes and violence.' 

In the weeks ahead of the raids, two of the suspects are believed to have attacked two female police officers during a random stop, punching them to the ground
