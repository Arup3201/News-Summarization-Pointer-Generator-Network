From babywear to wedding rings, ISIS supporters have been showing off their appalling taste in fashion on social media.

Most ISIS merchandises appear to be cheaply made and poor quality, always adorned with the ISIS badge.

The uninspiring fashion pieces have been seen being worn by fighters, mothers and babies living in ISIS territory in Syria and Iraq. 

ISIS Infant: Jihadi mothers have regularly posted pictures of their babies wrapped up in an assortment of terrible fashion creations.

Indoctrinated: Young babies have been pictured, miserably wrapped in Islamic State flags and an assortment of ill fitting hats.

Naturally nearly all the merchandises are based around the dull colour scheme of black and white.

The uninspiring colours embody the values of the extremist group’s flag, the famous black banner long associated with Islamic State and radical Islam.

Any other colour could be a hint of apostasy, or worse interest in the tight fitting world of Western clothes.

From schoolbags to berets, ISIS's vile taste in fashion and merchandises knows no limits.

Jihadi mothers in Syria and Iraq obsessively show off their little darlings, decked out in Islamic State’s latest naff fashion pieces.

Young babies have been pictured, miserably wrapped in Islamic State rugs, highlighting the extremist group’s obsession with indoctrinating children from a young age.

Oblivious to their unexplained allegiance to the group, their heads have been covered with an itchy looking hats with the ISIS logo emblazoned on in Arabic.

Unaware of their fashion faux pas, some kids have been forced to wear mini ISIS military uniforms and t-shirts. 

Oblivious to their unexplained allegiance to the group, this ISIS child's head has been covered with an itchy looking hat, emblazoned with 'God is Great' in Arabic.

Other children have been kitted out in ill-fitting military uniforms, struggling to hold onto the rifle which has been thrusted into their arms for the photo. 

School children have been photographed, proudly wearing ISIS branded school bags as they walk to school.

One young girl is pictured posing from behind to show off her own ISIS draw string bag. Wearing a thick quilted pink coat, matching gloves and a niqab, the seven old is dwarfed by the heavy bag.

Casio watches are one of the most popular brand in Syria and Iraq, appealing to many fighters due to their durability and low cost. 

Cheap rings and watches seem to always be on show, with jihadists desperate to show off their appalling taste in fashion.

For the fighters, one of the essential fashion items  is the wrist watch, specifically cheap, digit time pieces, easily found in Syria and Iraq.

Casio watches are one of the most popular brand in Syria and Iraq, appealing to many fighters due to their durability and low cost.

In contrast, Senior ISIS figures seem to prefer more expensive tastes in watches. ISIS’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was spotted wearing an expensive Omega watch when he declared the creation of the caliphate in July 2014.

Fashion statement: One jihadi fighter proudly shows off his oversized watch, cheap ring and silver pistol.

Bling ring: Ridiculous wedding rings, overloaded with nasty cheap stones and coated in imitation silver are also highly popular in Islamic State territory.

Suspect style icon: A fashion conscious South African jihadi shows off his latest accessory, an Islamic State ring.

Rings are another accessory which many fighters seem to buy the moment they join ISIS.

With weddings happening on regular basis, fighters are always keen to show off their latest tacky assessory, cheaply made from a plastic mould.

Some wealthier fighters have posted pictures of their ridiculous wedding rings, overloaded with nasty cheap stones and coated in imitation silver. 

The ring box appears to be of better quality than some of the rings being sold in Islamic State. 

Nasty looking hats and oversized t-shirts are considered stylish by some fighters in Syria and Iraq.

The balaclava and martyrs headband are a popular purchase among ISIS fighters.

Uninspiring black T-shirts and uncomfortable looking headbands have also been mass produced by the radical terror group. 

Dodgy Western style baseball caps, complete with a large ISIS logo on the front, are also popular sellers for sun conscious fighters.  

Likewise, the snood is another atrocious fashion piece, regularly spotted being worn by ignorant ISIS fighters on the battlefield in Iraq. 

Once a fashion piece worn by Premier League footballers, the snood is another atrocious style icon regularly spotted being worn by ignorant ISIS fighters on the battlefield in Iraq.

Style shockers: British ISIS fighter Mohammed Hadi (left), from Coventry, is a lover of the embarassing 'socks and sandals' combination. An array of unflattering sunglasses are also regularly shown off by jihadis on social media.

Despite their hatred of the West, ISIS fighters love to show off their latest pair of western branded trainers. 

Nike is always a favourite brand, popular for their style and comfort. 

However not all ISIS supporters like jihadi fighters wearing the Western brands. 

One fighter Abu Sarayah, was embarrassingly criticised by another radical ISIS supporter on social media user, who called him a disbeliever for wearing the trainers.

"Wearing Nike is the same thing as wearing clothes with crosses", commented the disgruntled user.

Another ISIS supporter waded into the argument and insisted Nike trainers were fine because they were comfy and good quality 'unlike crosses.' 

Showoffs: Despite their hatred of the West, ISIS fighters love to show off their latest pair of western branded trainers.

One fighter Abu Sarayah, was embarrassingly criticised by another radical ISIS supporter on social media user after showing off his trainers.

According to one deluded ISIS supporter, "Wearing Nike is the same thing as wearing clothes with crosses."
