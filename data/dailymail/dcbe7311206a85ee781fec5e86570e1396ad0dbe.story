The woman accused of befriending a 
$30million lottery winner, swindling him of his cash and then killing him was last night sentenced to life in prison.

Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore, 40, was convicted of first-degree murder, after she killed Florida lottery winner Abraham Shakespeare. She became close to Abraham by claiming she was writing a book about him.

Shakespeare's body was found under a concrete slab behind a home detectives say was owned by Moore's ex-boyfriend in Hillsborough County. He had been shot twice.

At the hearing, Moore showed little emotion as the verdict was read, and Judge Emmett Battles said that she was 'the most manipulative person' he had ever seen and described her as 'cold, calculating and cruel.'

Moore was also briefly banned from the courtroom over concerns that she may have threatened jurors. She was back a short time 
later for closing arguments, but said she did not want to take the stand in 
order to protect her family.

Moore is accused of killing Shakespeare, of Polk County, in April 2009. He won a $30million lottery jackpot in 2006.

Prosecutors said the 40-year-old Moore befriended Shakespeare in late 2008, 
claiming she was writing a book about how people were taking advantage of him. 
They claim Moore later became his financial adviser, eventually controlling 
every asset he had left after his death, including an expensive home, the debt owed to him and a 
$1.5 million annuity.

'She got every bit of his money,' said Assistant State 
Attorney Jay Pruner in closing arguments. 'He found out about it and threatened 
to kill her. She killed him first.'

Sheriff David Gee alleged that she tried to dodge suspicion by using 
Shakespeare's phone to send family members text messages saying he was 
OK and also writing letters pretending to be him, according to 10 News.

Moore denied the murder and says she took over Shakespeare's assets, about $3.5million and a mansion, authorities say, so he could get away from people pestering him for money.

'The money was like a curse to him. And 
now it's become a curse to me,' Moore told reporters in 2010. 'God knows
I would never take another human being's life.'

But investigators claim Moore turned to a man called Greg Smith to cover up the crime.

Smith was already signed up as a sheriff's informant and was working with detectives to get close to her and gather information.

Sheriff Gee alleged Moore trusted him so much that she asked him for help to find a prisoner willing to
take the blame for killing Shakespeare in exchange for $50,000.

During jury selection, a pool of 100 prospective jurors was screened yesterday. 10
News reported that more than half raised their hand when asked if they 
were familiar with the case and will now each have to be quizzed on the 
extent of their knowledge of the case.

After his win Shakespeare, a 43-year-old truck driver, won a court challenge from a fellow trucker who accused him of snatching the winning ticket out of his wallet while the two were delivering meat to Miami restaurants.

Shakespeare's family reported him missing in November 2009, telling the Polk County sheriff's office they hadn't seen him since April.

Speaking at the time, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said when their investigation began they had hoped to find Shakespeare alive.

When the body was found, his brother Robert Brown was quoted by 10 News as saying: 'I'm missing my little brother, what ain't gonna be back no more.

'Dead and gone, and everything. He ain't coming back.'
