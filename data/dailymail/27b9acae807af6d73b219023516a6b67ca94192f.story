Defense lawyers say they're negotiating with prosecutors for a plea deal in the case of a Utah woman accused of killing six of her newborn babies and storing their bodies in her garage.

A hearing in the case of 39-year-old Megan Huntsman was delayed for two weeks Monday.

She faces six counts of murder in the deaths that spanned 10 years after the corpses were discovered by her estranged husband when he cleaned the garage last April.

Defense attorney Jennifer Foresta said the two sides are working on the matter, The Daily Herald of Provo reports.

Judge Darold McDade says the case could be resolved in the hearing rescheduled for February 9.

Police have alleged Huntsman was addicted to methamphetamine when she killed the six infants over 10 years. 

Investigators say husband Darren West is the babies' father, but he isn't a suspect.

Appearing in court on Monday for an arraignment hearing, Huntsman did not enter any pleas due to the ongoing negotiations.

'We're not ready to set trial and we're not ready for a plea yet,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Jared Perkins said outside of court.

Perkins said plea negotiations have been 'pretty smooth,' but attorneys wanted to give Huntsman more time to consider her options before resolving the case. 

He declined to give specifics about the proposed resolution.
