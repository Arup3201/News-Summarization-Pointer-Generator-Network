A judge has condemned a former soldier for his 'frenzied revenge attack' after he stabbed the mother of his four-year-old son to death in front of him after he found out she had secretly aborted their unborn baby.

Lance Corporal Ian Lowe, 25, was jailed for life today after he knifed 24-year old Leanne McNuff in front of their four year old son after he unexpectedly learned of the termination when he hacked into her page on Facebook.

Relatives of Leanne wept in the public
gallery as the judge Mr Justice Alistair MacDuff told Lowe: 'Yours was a frenzied revenge attack 
and cold blooded murder. You robbed her of her young life and your son 
of his mother. The anguish you have caused is beyond words.'

their four year old son after he unexpectedly learned of the termination

The soldier, who had just been
dumped by Leanne, posted messages on his own Facebook page saying: 'My 
life is in absolute s*** state and I got no f***** to help me.

'Not even the army will help me out 
after all I have done for Queen and country. Need a weapon out of 
armoury to shoot the b****'.

He then kicked in the door at the home
of call centre worker Leanne and repeatedly stabbed her in the upper 
body and stamped on her face as their son Jaden looked on in horror.

When family who lived next door raced 
to the scene, they found Lowe had already fled, leaving Leanne dying on 
the landing floor. Jaden was found on the landing holding his teddy bear
screaming: 'Daddy's killed mummy and she is all red.'

Devastated: Leanne's mother Margaret McNuff told police Jaden is very confused and sometimes thinks his mother is in hospital

The judge added: 'She was in
the sanctuary of her own home when you committed this wicked act in the
presence of your four year old son.

'The fear and pain she must have felt 
in her dying minutes is unimaginable. You are evil and dangerous. You 
went round there to get even with her - blaming her as you had done on 
so many previous occasions for the mess you had got yourself into.'

Leanne suffered 22 separate wounds to her body and she died in hospital. Her mother Margaret McNuff later told police: 'Jaden is very confused - he will say his mum is in hospital getting better one day and then the next will say that she's in the sky with the angels.'

Today at Manchester Crown Court Lowe, who served in Afghanistan, showed no emotion as he was found guilty of murder and was ordered to serve a minimum 28 years.

The jury was told the couple had originally began dating in 2006 and Jaden was born the following year but they split up last February after a series of rows.

Lowe, nicknamed 'Boom Boom', warned Leanne he would 'make her life hell,' and in text messages Leanne replied: ' I clearly mean nothing to you. There's only do much hurt I can take.'

In 2010 Miss McNuff made a complaint to the army that Lowe had threatened to 'get a hitman to kill her over Child Support Agency payments'.

On Valentine's Day Leanne then 
discovered she was pregnant with Lowe's baby and rang him at his 
barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire where he was serving in the 1st 
Battalion, the Duke of Lancaster Regiment and due to go on a tour of 
Afghanistan.

'She made it 
clear that although she didn't want to resume a relationship with him 
she would not prevent him from seeing either Jaden or the baby when it 
was born,' said Neil Flewitt QC prosecuting.

'The
defendant responded saying if they could not live together as a family 
his life wouldn't be worth living and he would commit suicide.'

Lowe
was allowed home from base on compassionate grounds and once back in 
Manchester begged Leanne to take him back. She agreed but said she 
'wouldn't kiss or cuddle him' because she 'no longer had feelings for 
him.'

During a meeting about
Jaden and the pregnancy at Leanne's house on February 18, a violent row
broke out when Lowe started telling Jaden that Leanne was a 
'prostitute' and accused her of 'sleeping around.'

As
she tried to push him out of the house in Droylsden, Greater 
Manchester, Lowe grabbed Leanne by the throat and began 'shaking her 
from side to side.'

Sentence: Lowe, Leanne and their baby son. Lowe, who
served in Afghanistan, showed no emotion as he was found guilty of 
murder and was ordered to serve a minimum 28 years in court today

In a statement given to police at the time, Leanne recalled: 'He's shaking me from side to side and I'm almost on the floor.

'I've
lost my footing but being held up by Ian gripping my clothing and he's 
shaking me about. Somehow, whilst he's still ragging me about, I've 
twisted and he's got hold of my hair.

'Now he's got a grip of my clothing and a grip of my hair and he's still shaking me about.

'At
some point he's let go of my jumper and his left arm has come around my
throat choking me and making it hard to breath for a few seconds. I was
frightened to death.

'I 
didn't know what was going to happen. I was scared wither he'd really 
hurt me or I'd lose the baby. I was scared for Jaden's safety.

'Then
Ian's released me and pushed me to the floor. He's gone to kick me. At 
first I think he was going to kick me hard but he held back and it 
wasn't a very hard kick in my back. Then he's picked up his bag and ran 
out of the gate'.

Crime scene: Floral tributes and police officers outside the house in Droylsden, Manchester after the attack. Lowe found out about Leanne's termination after hacking into her Facebook account

Lowe was later arrested and charged with assault and was ordered not to contact Leanne as part of his bail conditions. But literally an hour after he was charged, a frightened Leanne ran police again claiming Lowe had telephoned her.

The following day on February 20, Leanne secretly went to an abortion clinic for a consultation with a nurse said her relationship with Lowe was definitely over and she secretly had a termination on March 1.

In the week before the killing on March 11, Lowe confided to his army superiors and the chaplain about his unhappiness at Leanne having a baby and his fears of being thrown out of the army over the assault allegation.

He eventually found out about the termination on March 10 when he hacked into Leanne's Facebook account and then wrote: 'Yet again she does it again, we split and she stops me and my family seeing Jaden. She tries to ruin my career, not only are you a benefit thief you are an oxygen thief as well'.

At 4.30pm. on the day of Leanne's death Ian wrote, 'Just to let everyone know Leanne had aborted the baby. She did not tell me or even given me a say in the matter'.

He then hacked her Facebook account falsely claiming she had slept with members of her own family and that is how he found out she had had the abortion because she had messaged it to one of her friends.

As he prepared to go back to camp Lowe went for a drink with his father and a family friend who said he 'looked as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.'

That night Leanne's mother Margaret McNuff and Margaret's son Ryan who lived next door, heard 'banging noises' coming from the victim's house.

Ryan ran next door to see the front door had been kicked off its hinges and saw Lowe walking quietly away. Margaret told the hearing: 'Jaden was stood there with a brown teddy bear and said: 'Nana can you help mummy.' Leanne was on her back.

'Her eyes were piercing wide open. I took Jaden down to get him away because I wasn't sure whether she was alive. Then I ran back up and just started CPR on her.'

She added: 'Leanne said she really wanted the child but she was scared for her own life and he'd never stay away from her if she had another baby. I am angry that Ian has taken her life. She was tiny - she could not have fought back. It was very brutal.'

The court heard Lowe had previously been convicted of assaulting his own mother Lorraine by throwing her against a car during an argument over Leanne.

He denied murder but admitted manslaughter claiming he had 'lost self control' and saying of Leanne and Jaden: 'They were my life'.
