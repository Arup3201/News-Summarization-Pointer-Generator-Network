My hair has been curled, my eyelids weighed down with enormous false 
lashes and my skin buffed with bronzing shimmer. I have squeezed myself 
with some difficulty into a skin-tight, yellow diamante-encrusted gown 
and satin high heels.

A 6ft 3in muscle-bound beefcake has me in his 
manly embrace - which I’m rather embarrassed about, as there’s sweat 
running between my shoulder blades and I suspect I’m probably not a very
 fragrant armful.

It’s certainly a far cry from my usual weekly 
exercise class, which sees me flinging on an ancient tracksuit and 
heading to an all-female Pilates studio. This, however, is keep fit 
Strictly-style.

Best foot forward: Professional dancer Ian Waite shows Lydia the elegant workout

The dance show has proved to be one of the world’s most effective (and exclusive) weight-loss bootcamps.

This
 year, portly actor Mark Benton shed a full 3st before he sambaed off 
the floor for the last time, an astonishing result - especially as he 
never seemed to move much.

'If you want to get fit, go and dance,' he
 declared. He seems to have a point. During each 13-week series, fans 
watch from the comfort of their sofas as the show’s stars shrink before 
their eyes.

Soap star Lisa Riley dropped three dress sizes on last 
year's Strictly, while astrologer Russell Grant, star of the 2011 show, 
boasted of having to have his trousers taken in by 7.5 inches.

Last 
month, the already-svelte broadcaster Susanna Reid announced she'd lost 
7lb - and each week since, she's flashed her enviable pins in another 
skimpy frock, looking slimmer and fitter than ever, while I tuck into a 
mince pie or three on the sofa.

With a round of Christmas parties 
beckoning, it is clear that my fitness regime needs a jump-start - but 
could a dance class really be enough to get me into my little black 
dress?

Strictly Come Dancing stars Ian Waite and Natalie Lowe 
certainly think so. The pair have launched a nationwide Strictly-themed 
fitness class, FitSteps (tagline: 'Fitness that's Strictly fun!') with 
former swimming gold medallist Mark Foster, who was a contestant in 
2008.

The classes are based on Strictly's traditional ballroom and 
classic Latin steps. Having a partner isn't necessary because classes 
are run line-dance style.

Nor, sadly, do you need a beautiful dress 
like the one I've borrowed from DSI, the dance clothing company which 
supplies Strictly, although pull-on floaty skirts are planned to help 
get participants in the mood.

And it doesn't even matter if you have
 two left feet like me and former contestant John Sergeant - the 
routines are so simple even children can follow them. Or so I'm told.

However,
 it doesn't feel like that as I watch Natalie and Ian charlestoning 
enthusiastically in front of me in a London studio, jazz-hands a-flutter
 as they call out the moves. I don’t think I'll ever be able to keep up,
 but their enviable physiques are enough to make me try.

Put through her paces: Natalie Lowe and Ian show Lydia the FitSteps moves

We start 
with what they term a 'gentle warm-up'. This turns out to be a brisk 
gallop through the tango, paso doble, cha-cha, samba, rumba, jive and 
waltz. After five minutes, I'm breathing hard, and technically we 
haven’t started the class yet.

Our first routine is based on the 
cha-cha, the swaying Latin dance. I've never taken dance lessons, but 
figure that all those hours watching Strictly should have stood me in 
good stead.

All the dancers on TV do a good deal of bottom-wiggling, 
so I try to do the same. But that isn't enough for Ian and Natalie. I 
must dance from side-to-side following the complicated 'one, two, 
cha-cha-cha' beat, then fling my arms out while pointing my toe and 
slowly sliding it across the floor.

As I run to and fro, trying to 
keep up with the toes twinkling in front of me, I fear my efforts are 
definitely more ha-ha than cha-cha. I'm just glad Craig Revel Horwood 
isn't there to deliver his verdict. At the end of the four-minute dance,
 my stomach achesis aching and I’m positively gasping for breath.

Fortunately,
 we’re moving on to a waltz, a step I (vaguely) know how to do. And - 
hurray! - it's a slowie. Except that the FitSteps version involves doing
 numerous sets of forward lunges, then dancing round in a square while 
pretending to clasp a partner in a ballroom hold.

After a few 
minutes of this, my biceps and shoulders are aching and I long to kick 
off my dancing shoes and slink back to the sofa. Still, according to 
Natalie, this will tone my upper arms, bottom and thighs, and it’s 
definitely more fun than Pilates.

Strictly fit: Dancing burns calories and tones muscles

From there, we change to a jive 
for a cardio-vascular workout which has me doing charleston kicks, 
throwing my arms in the air, and jumping round in little circles. And 
finally, there's a quickstep for all-over body-toning.

To my 
untrained eye, the celebrities on Strictly look as though they are just 
running across the floor during the quickstep, but having learned the 
fiendishly difficult dance moves, I have new respect for their abilities
-— and I have aches where I didn’t know I had muscles.

This, of 
course, is the point of FitSteps. The exercise is the brainchild of 
swimmer Mark Foster, who was a contestant on Strictly in 2008, straight 
after competing in the Beijing Olympics. 'I was the fittest I'd ever 
been,' he tells me. 'But when I went on Strictly, I lost another half 
stone and became fitter and more toned just from dancing.

'I also 
became aware of my posture in a way I never was when I was swimming. 
Then, all I thought about was how to get to the other end of the pool as
 fast as possible - I never worried about what I looked like. But 
dancing is all about posture and core strength.'

Mark then danced 
with Natalie on the Strictly arena tour last year, and suggested they 
team up to create a ballroom dance-based fitness programme. She brought 
in her dance partner, Ian, who had been making similar plans. ‘I had 
thought, I know the ballroom and classic Latin steps do such a good job 
for the body, why can’t there be a class using them all?’ says Ian.

FitSteps
 launched in June, and Strictly fever means the class has already taken 
off. There are over 1,200 licensed instructors across the country, all 
of whom have been trained in the Strictly Fit workout, and more than 
1,400 classes available every week, catering for everyone from 
under-tens to over-70s.

'People want to get fitter and healthier, 
and the best way is by doing something you love,' says Mark. 'Lots of 
people don’t like going to the gym or running, but they choose to go 
dancing on a Saturday night. So it makes sense.'

Better than boot camp: Actor Mark Benton lost weight on this year's Strictly

According to 
FitSteps Programme Director, Damian Lo Cascio, a woman of average weight
 and height will burn around 750 calories in one 45-minute class - 
compared with around 450 calories for the same time spent swimming. 'As 
soon as you stand up and take a ballroom hold, you engage all of your 
upper body muscles, all your back muscles, your arm muscles, your 
laterals and all of your abdominals,' he says.

'That's the main 
difference between doing this and something like Zumba or aerobics, 
where your legs move but your arms are quite floppy. It increases the 
calorie burn massively.'

IT trainer Ingrid Foan, 55, has been attending Ian's Berkshire class every week since it launched.

'It's
 the most inspirational class I've ever been to,' she raves. 'We do this
 American Smooth, and you feel like you're in the show.'

Apparently some attendees dropped a dress size in three weeks.

I
 can certainly see how. I've managed just 25 minutes, and my leg muscles
 are shaking. I've probably burned 300 calories. Best of all, I haven't 
really noticed the pain, because I've been concentrating far too hard on
 learning the steps.

And while I may not exactly be Strictly siren Abbey Clancy, it turns out I've got more dance potential than Ann Widdecombe.

'If
 I had you as my partner on Strictly, I'd be delighted,' says Natalie, 
kindly. That's me sold. I'll be signing up to a regular class, just to 
ensure my basic moves are up to scratch in case Strictly comes calling.
