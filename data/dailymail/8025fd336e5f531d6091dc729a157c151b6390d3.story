Giuseppe Rossi's grandfather has labelled Cesare Prandelli 'a traitor' after the Italy boss excluded the striker from the World Cup squad.

The Fiorentina hitman had recovered from five months out with a knee injury and featured in Italy's 0-0 draw with Republic of Ireland at Craven Cottage on Saturday.

But Prandelli, who admits the game was decisive ahead of choosing his final squad for the tournament in Brazil, wielded the axe on the United States born star who will now miss out on his third straight international competition.

Rossi's grandfather, Bruno Petrocelli, has been left fuming at the decision and let out his anger on Italian radio.

He said: Two days ago Prandelli said many fine words, then 48 hours later he changed his mind.

'Prandelli
 has made the biggest farce of his career, he has betrayed Rossi and did
 not live to convene a player like my granddson who is in excellent 
health.

'I will not be rooting for Italy, in that there are national traitors. I'll be cheering for the USA.

'It's
 [Prandelli] not good enough to judge my grandson and there's nothing 
more I can say. I know that my grandson's fit and he has a medical 
certificate to prove it.'Â

The former Manchester United striker has already shown his unhappiness, challenging Prandelli's exclusion of him based on his fitness.

Rossi said on Twitter: 'Everyone is saying I'm out of shape: ask anyone the results of the tests from last week and from the match, you will be surprised. Challenges? Fear? What a laugh.'

Instead of Rossi, Italy have selected Mario Balotelli, Antonio Cassano, Alessio Cerci, Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne (Napoli) as their strikeforce as they now prepare for their opening group game against England on June 14.

Rossi's latest axing is his third consecutive major tournament heartbreak since making his debut for the Azzurri in 2008.

The 27 year-old was left out of Marcello Lippi's World Cup squad in 2010, where Italy as world champions crashed out in the group stage.

While injury ruled Rossi out of the Prandelli's Euro 2012 squad where the Azzurri reached the final.
