Serial pest: Gordon Clarke, a man dubbed Britain's worst neighbour has dodged jail - despite a 25-year reign of terror that has seen him jailed three times

A man dubbed Britain’s worst neighbour has dodged jail - despite a 25-year reign of terror that has seen him jailed three times.

Serial pest Gordon Clarke was found guilty of harassment without violence earlier this month after he repeatedly lit bonfires in his back garden in Crawley, West Sussex, to deliberately send smelly smoke all over the neighbourhood Magistrates Court heard.

The 52-year-old - who was jailed for 70 days in 1998 for harassment, 30 days in 2001 for breaking a restraining order and for nine months in 2008 for breaching his Asbo - has caused misery to his neighbours John Ferraira, Lara Sanger and Graham Sanger for the last 25 years, the court heard.

During the screening of the 1995 documentary about nightmare neighbours Clarke’s wife Jay bragged how she painted her house pink, bought a goat and wanted to buy crowing cockerels ‘just to annoy locals’.

Previously Dad-of-five Gordon Clarke has been given two Asbos for a string of anti-social behaviour.

But last week Clarke was spared jail, despite repeated breaches of an Asbo handed to him in 2001 and 2006 preventing him from ‘harassing and tormenting his neighbours’.

He was handed a one year community order, 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £300 in court costs at Horsham Magistrates Court last week - to the disgust of his neighbours.

The court heard how he repeatedly lit bonfires in the summer of 2010 - some which burned for as long as seven hours - to send smelly smoke into neighbouring gardens.

Neighbour Lara Sanger, who said Clarke’s behaviour left her ‘constantly on edge’ and another Graham Sanger said at a previous court hearing: 'It has ruined the quality of life for myself and many other residents.

'I can’t convey just how much of a detrimental effect this is having.'

At a trial at the Old Bailey in September 2008 - where Clarke was jailed for nine months after being found guilty of breaching his Asbo - the court heard how Clarke had routinely ignored police and council warnings about his vile behaviour for ‘more than two decades’.

One neighbour, who refused to be named, said this week: 'How he cannot be sent to jail after 25 years of this type of behaviour is beyond me.

'He has shown that he cannot change his ways, but instead of punishing him they just give him a bit of work to do and a fine.

'He’ll be back causing hell the moment he thinks he can get away with it.'

She added: 'Many people have left the street because of Gordon’s behaviour, but some people simply can’t afford to move away - he’s made life hell for everyone for a quarter of a century, surely that’s enough.'
