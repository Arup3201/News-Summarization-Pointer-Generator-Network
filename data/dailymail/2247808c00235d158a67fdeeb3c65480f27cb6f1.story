An iPhone-shaped memorial to Apple founder Steve Jobs has been removed from outside a Russian university campus after current CEO Tim Cook announced that he is gay.

The 6ft-high statue had been put up outside a college in St Petersburg in January 2013 by a Russian group of companies called West European Financial Union (ZEFS) to honour Jobs.

However, in a statement on Monday, ZEFS said they had to abide by a law combating 'gay propaganda' and that the memorial had been removed.

The monument was dismantled on Friday, the day after Cook, who succeeded Jobs at the helm of the company,  publicly acknowledged he was gay in an essay. 

'In Russia, gay propaganda and other sexual perversions
among minors are prohibited by law,' ZEFS said, noting that the
memorial had been 'in an area of direct access for young
students and scholars'.

'After Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly called for sodomy, the
monument was taken down to abide to the Russian federal law
protecting children from information promoting denial of
traditional family values.'

Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law prohibiting what he called the spread of 'gay propaganda' among minors, and promoting 'traditional values'.

Putin claims gay people in Russia are not discriminated against, and the law was needed only to protect young people. However, members of the gay community say the law has led to increased problems for them. 

The 'gay propaganda' law caused outrage and protests in the West, particularly in the run-up to the Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in February.

Cook said he had decided to come out to help move forward
civil rights, confirming a fact that had been widely known in
the Silicon Valley tech community but was rarely discussed. 

Vitaly Milonov, a St Petersburg lawyer and campaigner against gay rights was among those behind the new law and, according to Russian media, has called for Cook to be banned from visiting Russia. 

ZEFS companies offer a range of products and services in areas such as real estate, construction, advertising and micro-financing. 

ZEFS head Maxim Dolgopolov, who ordered the removal
of the monument, expressed opposition to personal sanctions in
Monday's statement, but supported the 'protection of traditional
values' by law.

'Sin should not become the norm. There is nothing to do in
Russia for whose who intend to violate our laws,' he said.
