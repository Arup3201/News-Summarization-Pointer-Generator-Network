Chelsea have confirmed that Nemanja Matic has returned to Stamford Bridge from Benfica for £21million, with the Serbia international signing a five-and-a-half-year deal.

The 25-year-old, who will wear the No 21 shirt, originally departed Chelsea as part of the deal which saw David Luiz move to west London from Benfica three years ago but is now back with the Blues.

Matic struggled to make an impact during his first spell at the club, spending a season on loan at Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem before heading to Portugal.

On signing his new contract, the 
25-year-old said: 'I am very happy for this opportunity to be back at 
this club. I feel very good because of that and just want to say I will 
give my best to help the team and make the Chelsea fans happy.'

Jose
 Mourinho added: 'I am very pleased that Nemanja is returning to 
Chelsea. He has grown as a player in Portugal and has become a fantastic
 all-round midfielder. I am sure he will become a very important member 
of the squad and help us to achieve our ambitions.'

Sportsmail
 revealed last week that Chelsea were pressing ahead in their interest 
for the Serb with Mourinho's assistant Jose Morais travelling to
 watch him play for Benfica in the 2-0 defeat of Porto on Sunday.

Matic revealed earlier this week that 
he had played his 'last game for Benfica' before finalising the move 24 
hours later.

Matic was at the Ballon d'Or gala dinner on Monday night and told Portuguese paper A Bola: 'Yes, it was my last game (against Porto). I want to thank all the people at the club and all the supporters. Benfica will be forever in my heart.

'I played here for two and a half years, I gave my best in every practice session, every game, and now is the right time to leave. I want to improve, I want to go to a better league and want to play for Chelsea, a club which I also like.

He added: 'I also thank the president of Benfica, who did everything he could to keep me here but I have wanted to leave and insisted on leaving.

On his way: Kevin de Bruyne is expected to join Wolfsburg for £16.7million

'I respect the effort made ​​to keep 
me at Benfica, and all the people of Benfica were very good to me, made 
​​me happy, but I repeat that I insisted on going out as I feel that the
 time is right.'

Meanwhile, Chelsea have accepted an initial £16.7million offer from Wolfsburg for Belgium winger Kevin de Bruyne.

The 22-year-old has agreed a five-and-a-half-year contract and is expected to undergo a medical on Tuesday.
