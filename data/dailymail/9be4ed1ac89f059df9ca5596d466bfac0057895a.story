A married army general could face jail over charges that he forcibly sexually assaulted a female captain

All the sordid details are coming out during a military trail in Fort Bragg, North Carolina where the army is court-martialling Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair, one of its generals, for just the third time in fifty years.

On trial: Brigadeer General Jeffrey A. Sinclair faces court martial on charges that include forcible sodomy and adultery

It was a volatile love affair that lasted for three years during which time the captain called her boss ‘Poppa Panda Sexy Pants.’

Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair, an 
Army Ranger and paratrooper is accused of forcible sodomy, adultery and 
other charges that could land him in prison.

Prosecutors
say he abused his authority by sleeping with a subordinate officer 
which is a taboo in the armed forces and a violation of military law.

The charges also suggest that the relationship became violent when he attempted to force the Captain to perform oral sex.

There are also some additional charges that allude Sinclair had inappropriate communications with three other female officers.

Sinclair has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Rare court-martial: The general will be tried at the end of September of sex assault charges

On patrol before being on trial: Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair served as a special assistant to the Commanding General, XVIII Airborne Corps

Well traveled: Sinclair has been deployed to combat in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan but could now face jail time after conducting a sordid affair with a Captain 17 years his junior

The case is being seen as a test of how well the U.S. military handles allegations of sexual assault.

President Obama recently demanding a crackdown after a host of scandals and admissions by military leaders.

Sinclair’s trial begins at the end of September but before then, the army is selecting a jury of five major generals, all men, who will decide his fate.

40 generals have so far been summoned to the military base to see if they are suitable to be included on the jury.

Almost all of the generals that were questioned said they believed  sexual assault was a serious problem in the ranks.

Although Sinclair has pleaded not guilty, his attorneys have acknowledged that he carried on an affair with a subordinate officer 17 years his junior.

Serious charges: The Army has charged Sinclair with forcible sodomy because of the oral sex allegations. More than 100 witnesses have been involved in the investigation

Reputation: The Army is trying to shelve its reputation of being awash with cases of sexual assault. 40 generals have been questioned so far to see if they could sit on the jury for Sinclair's upcoming trial

During a pretrial hearing last year, the woman testified that the pair had sex in the general’s quarters in Iraq, in her car in a German parking lot, in an office in Afghanistan and even on a hotel balcony in Arizona.

The affair may well have remained a secret however the  general and the captain  ended up bombarding one another with explicit and angry text messages.

The Washington Post has revealed how one read: ‘You are my heart and world you beautiful magnificent man,’ whilst the captain texted the general, ‘I need you and I mean really deeply profusely need you.’

There was also a darker side to the affair where the captain threatened to kill herself or expose Sinclair to his superiors.

The affair exploded out into the open when in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in March 2012, the captain was snooping through Sinclair’s e-mail in his office and discovered loving messages to his wife, as well as love notes to another female Army officer.

The captain has admitted she flew into a jealous rage first firing off an e-mail to the other female officer, saying, ‘I hope you don’t think you’re the only girl that he’s sleeping with.’

Witnesses: More than a 100 people have been interviewed in connection to Sinclair's affair, many of whom had turned a blind eye whilst the relationship was developing

Uniquely understanding: Rebecca Sinclair, wife of General Jeff Sinclair said last year that she understood why her husband had an affair and agreed that the the strains of war had lead to infidelity

Then she entered the office of Maj. Gen. James L. Huggins, then the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division and leader of all U.S. forces in southern Afghanistan and spent two hours confessing to the affair.

Phonecalls and emails followed amongst the army’s top brass and a full investigation was launched that spoke to more than 100 witnesses.

The became even more serious when the captain accused Sinclair of sexual assault by forcing her to perform oral sex against her will on two occasions in Afghanistan.

The Army charged Sinclair with forcible sodomy because of the oral sex allegations.

The captain testified that the assaults occurred between December 2011 and February 2012 but said she cannot recall the exact dates.

Defense attorneys have accused her of making up the assault allegations to save her Army career.

They said she first told one confidant that the relationship was entirely consensual but gave investigators a different version after she realized that she, too, could be kicked out of the Army for adultery.

Sinclair also is charged with having inappropriate relations with three other female junior officers.

In November, Sinclair’s wife, Rebecca, stunned many in the Army when she wrote an op-ed column in The Washington Post to declare that she was sticking by her husband and that she blamed his infidelity on ‘the stress of war.’

Mrs Sinclair said her husband may be a cheater but not a violent abuser. ‘I don’t excuse my husband’s bad behavior or bad judgment,’ she said. ‘I never said it’s okay. I said I understand how it could happen.’

Although she has not attended most of the court proceedings, she said she’s still living with the general. ‘We’re doing the best we can,’ she said. ‘It’s draining.’
