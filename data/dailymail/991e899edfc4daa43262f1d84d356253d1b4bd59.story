A teenage mother has been left devastated after finding out that her 'boyfriend' - millionaire rapper Bow Wow - was in fact a woman conducting an elaborate Catfish hoax. 

Keyonnah's whirlwind romance started four months ago when she liked Bow Wow's fan page on Facebook. Out of the blue, the rapper began messaging her, escalating to daily text messages where the pair would plan their life together.

The super fan became more and more convinced of the relationship as Bow Wow sent her $10,000 over the course of the relationship.

However Keyonnah retained some skepticism, so contacted MTV show Catfish, which checks out online relationships to find out if real life matches up to the online world.

Sadly for Keyonnah she had been duped - by a lesbian woman from Atlanta named Dee.

Dee told the MTV cameras that she created the Bow Wow profile to lure straight women.

She said: 'I know Bow Wow, he gets that attention. All the girls love him.'

Dee added that although it was mainly straight girls who contacted her in the belief that she was rapper Bow Wow, she didn't mind as she likes a 'challenge'.

Dee, a lesbian woman from Atlanta, admitted that she had pretended to be Bow Wow to Keyonnah. She said that she had duped other straight women into believing she was a man

The Catfish prankster also claimed to have duped a lot of women by dressing like a boy and wearing an 'accessory' in bed.

The $10,000 that she gave to Keyonnah had been entirely borrowed from family and friends.

Perhaps unsuprisingly, the relationship ended there.

However one winner from the situation was Bow Wow himself who later posted a video message on his website.

He said: 'I feel honored. It’s dope and it’s fly when 
someone wants to be you. And not only they wanna be you, in their mind 
they are you. That’s crazy. But I like it. It’s free promo. For myself.'

The real deal: Following the Catfish hoax, rapper Bow Wow said he like the 'free promo'
