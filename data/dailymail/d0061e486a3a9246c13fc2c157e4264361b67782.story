Jailed: Munir Patel will serve six years in prison after accepting bribes to delete records of speeding offences

A crooked court clerk who helped at least 53 offenders escape justice yesterday became the first person to be jailed under new bribery laws.

Munir Patel, 22, received a three-year prison term for taking bribes.

He was also given six years for misconduct in a public office. The sentences will run concurrently.

He used his privileged access to official databases in the back rooms of a magistrates’ court to wipe the convictions of motorists from the records – in return for £500 a time from the accused.

He also advised defendants on how to avoid being brought to court, while working in an administrative capacity at Redbridge Magistrates’ Court in East London, on a salary of £17,978.

Patel was filmed by a hidden camera boasting that he took bribes ‘all day long’.

For his known corruption Patel was paid at least £20,000, but the total profits of his corruption may have been around £96,000. Police believe he helped at least 53 people accused of driving offences.

At Southwark Cown Court, Patel, of 
Dagenham, Essex, admitted bribery and misconduct in a public office 
between February 2009 and August this year.

The court heard that £53,814 in cash 
was deposited in his bank account while another £42,383 was transferred 
into the same account, both without explanation.

Patel, of Green Lane, Dagenham, east London, the judge said there were 
'no sentencing guidelines' with which to work, given that the case was 
the first of its kind under the new legislation.

The defendant, who married just two months ago, mouthed 'Don't worry' to friends and family who packed into the public gallery as he was led from the dock.

It was widely expected that the first case involving the much-heralded Bribery Act legislation, which superseded century-old laws, would involve a high-profile corporate case.

The Serious Fraud Office had announced it would use the Act to pursue big companies and foreign businesses suspected of bribery.

The Bribery Act, which was introduced
in July, covers offering a bribe, passively receiving inducements, 
bribing foreign officials and failing to stop bribes on behalf of a 
company.
