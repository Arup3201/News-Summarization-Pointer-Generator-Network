A former Texas police officer has been charged after he allegedly beat a young man he claimed was speeding and subsequently his entire family who tried to protect him.

Former policeman, Deputy Jimmy Drummond, was caught by a police car's dash-cam allegedly throwing mother Yvonne Scherz onto the road, before running over to her son, David Braxton Scherz Jr, who was being held face-down on the ground, and allegedly kicking him five times.

A photo of David after the incident showed his face was badly bruised and cut across one side. According to the police documents, seen by the Mail Online, he also suffered a fractured rib.

Charged: Former Precinct 4 Deputy, Jimmy Drummond, has been charged after allegedly using excessive force to arrest an entire family he claimed was speeding

The documents reveal Drummond, who has since left the force, was charged on Monday with official oppression, a misdemeanor. If found guilty, Drummond could face up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $4,000.

The Scherz family are also campaigning for other deputies involved to face similar charges, according to abclocal.com.

Backed by human rights lawyer Randall Kallinen, the family attended Harris County Criminal Courthouse, Houston, Texas, this week to urge the District Attorney's office to file criminal charges against all officers involved.

Kallinen is quoted in abclocal.com saying: 'We're here today to make sure that the Harris County District Attorney's Office does not have any questions, does not have any more evidence that it needs.'

Now it has emerged, according to the New York Daily News, that Drummond was allegedly known for being a 'heavy handed' police officer.

Mr Kallinen told the paper he had a history of excessive force, which his superiors were aware of.

The incident happened in September 2011 outside the family's North Houston home, on Ridge Top Drive, after the son had pulled up and parked the car.

He then appears to come running over to two other officers, directly in front of the vehicle, where they were holding Mr Scherz Jr face down on the ground

The heavy officer is then seen allegedly kicking the man on the ground five times

First the footage shows Drummond allegedly throwing Mrs Scherz across the road and onto the floor.

It then shows Drummond running over to the detained driver, who is being held face-down on the ground to tow other officers, and allegedly kicking him five times.

The heavy man then allegedly puts his knee on David's back who is lying face-down his hands cuffed behind his back.

At one point a little white dog trots out from the family's driveway and sniffs around investigating. As it walked back towards the house, Drummond is seen allegedly kicking the dog away.

A girl also runs out from the driveway and is seen slowly stepping backwards as an officer approaches her.

When father David Scherz asked why Drummond was arresting his wife, the officer replied: 'Interference with an investigation,' according to abclocal.com.

Mr Scherz then responds: 'Investigation of what? You are on our property, sir!'

After the incident, all five members of the Scherz family were initially charged. But all charges were later dropped, according to the New York Daily News. The news service added that the family filed the complaint last month, nearly two years since the incident.
