House prices are rising at their fastest pace for nearly seven years with the average home costing nearly £18,000 more than it did last year, the Nationwide said yesterday.

Graham Beale, chief executive of the building society, warned: ‘We need to watch the situation carefully.’ In just one year, house prices have jumped by 10.9 per cent, the first time that annual house price inflation has been in double figures since 2010 and the highest rate since June 2007.

But the Nationwide raised its fears about the growing gulf between what people earn and what they have to pay to buy a property.

Graham Beale, chief executive of Nationwide building society warned that the rise in house prices needed to be watched 'carefully'

The average worker with a full-time job earns around £27,000, but the average house price has jumped to £183,577, which is nearly seven times higher than their salary.

Robert Gardner, chief economist at the Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, warned of the ‘wide margin’ between the rate at which house prices are rising and people’s pay rises.

Official figures, from the Office for National Statistics, reveal the average pay rises is currently 1.7 per cent a year, compared to house price growth of 10.9 per cent a year.

As a result, people’s pay is barely moving but house prices are rising rapidly.

On Wednesday, the Land Registry said 33 homes a day are selling for more than £1million, with the majority found in London and the South East.

Yesterday Nationwide said one in four homes in London are now sold for £500,000 or more, compared to only 13 per cent in 2007.

‘More than six per cent’ of properties sold in the capital cost more than £1million, it said.Mr Gardner said: ‘House price growth is outstripping income growth by a wide margin.

‘The risk is that, unless supply accelerates significantly, affordability will become stretched.’ In April last year, the average home cost £165,586. Today it costs £183,577, a rise of £17,991, the sort of pay rises which most workers can only dream about.

New figures from the Office of National statistics show that house prices have increased by 10.9 percent over the past year

Jeremy Duncombe, director of the insurer Legal & General’s mortgage club, said: ‘It is extremely important that house price growth is kept at sustainable levels or the market risks over-heating.

‘The risk of a ‘bubble’ forming in the capital remains very real. A key part of controlling house price growth is to build more houses. ‘ Mr Beale also warned: ‘Prices are affected by the fact that not enough houses are being built to keep up with the number of households being formed, so demand is outstripping supply.’

To add to the pressure on homebuyers, the stamp duty bill is proving a growing burden. As house prices rises, the tax bill also grows.

Clare Francis, from the comparison website Moneysupermarket, said stamp duty is ‘another obstacle hampering homeownership.’

She added: ‘The thresholds [at which stamp duty is charged] have been held at the same levels for years now. Rising property prices mean that an increasing number of first-time buyers have to pay the three per cent rate.

‘This isn’t right and it is time for the government to reform this tax.’ The Council of Mortgage Lenders said rising house prices are helping homeowners with an interest-only mortgage, which means they only pay the interest on the loan, but not the loan itself.

Around 2.2million people have an interest only mortgage, and it said only ‘a relatively modest’ number have no plan for repaying the loan when the time comes.

Over the last year, mortgage lenders have been contacting all homeowner with this type of loan, if it matures before the end of 2020, to discuss what they are planning to do.
