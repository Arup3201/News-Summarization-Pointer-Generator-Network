The body of a British schoolgirl raped and murdered in Goa can finally be buried four years after her death - following claims of a communication blunder by Indian authorities and the Foreign Office.

Scarlett Keeling, 15, was sexually assaulted and left for dead on a beach in the Indian holiday state in February 2008 after taking a cocktail of drugs.

Months later, following two post-mortem tests in Goa, her body was brought back to Britain but has lain in a mortuary at an Exeter hospital amid the ongoing trial of two men charged over her death.

Long wait: The body of Scarlett Keeling, left, who was raped and murdered in 2008, will be buried on June 17 - which would have been her 20th birthday. Her mother, Fiona MacKeown, right, said she was relieved but angry

A third pathology examination was carried out three years ago following a request by Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland.

But the Foreign Office have only now informed the coroner that Goan authorities have given the green light for the body to be released.

It is not known when Goa granted permission. But Scarlett's mother Fiona MacKeown believes a lack of communication between the two governments led to a delay.

The schoolgirl, who had been left with a 25-year-old Indian boyfriend while her mother travelled with her six other children, will be buried near the family’s rural home in Brandiworthy.

A funeral will be held on June 17th - which would have been Scarlett’s 20th birthday.

Mrs
MacKeown, who claims Goan authorities engaged in a cover-up to prevent 
the beach paradise’s ‘seedy underbelly’ from being exposed, today said 
she was relieved that she can finally lay her daughter to rest - but angry about the delay.

She said: ‘It’s a relief to bring her home where she belongs back with us. I have been expecting it for four years but it could have been another four years.’

But she said she was ‘disgusted’ with the lack of communication between the Indian authorities and Foreign Office which meant Scarlett’s body could have been released to the family three years ago.

Mrs MacKeown, 48, said the family has been through ‘a living hell’.

Mourning: Scarlett's family, including her former stepfather Rob Clarke, days after her death in February 2008

The mother-of-nine, who was 100 miles 
away when Scarlett died, faced allegations of neglect in Goa amid claims
that she allowed her daughter to use drugs.

Scarlett,
who had been dating Indian tour guide Julio Lobo at the time of her 
death, had been photographed rolling what appeared to be cannabis joint.

Mrs MacKeown refused to attend the court in Goa over the claims in October 2008.

But two years ago, she was hauled before Exeter Crown Court and convicted of benefits fraud and narrowly avoided jail by being handed an eight-month suspended sentence.

She had dishonestly obtained £19,500 
in child benefit payments from the taxpayer - even though her former 
partner Richard Keeling was paying voluntary maintenance for three of 
the children, including Scarlett.

Scarlett
suffered 50 separate injuries in the attack in February 2008 but all 
but five of those were missed at the original post mortem, which found 
she drowned accidentally.

Police chief Nerlon Albuquerque insisted it had been caused by Scarlett hitting her head and body on the seabed as she drowned, it was said.

But a second post-mortem examination.  showed she had been raped and murdered.

The Goan government’s chief pathologist said she had been held under water for five to ten minutes.

Tests showed she had taken ecstasy, cocaine and LSD before her death on Anjuna beach in February 2008.

Two men went on trial in Goa over Scarlett’s death. Samson D’Souza, 30, and Placido Carvalho, 42, are on trial for culpable homicide, sexual assault, outraing modesty and destrying evidence.

The long running trial has still not reached a conclusion.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have provided consular assistance to the family since the start of this tragic case and we continue to do so.

'The decision to release Scarlett rests with the UK Coroner.  While we cannot interfere in the Coroner’s inquest, we will continue to do all we rightly can to assist the Coroner and the family.'
