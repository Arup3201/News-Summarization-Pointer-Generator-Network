Britons have told of their terror as hundreds of residents were evacuated from one of the world's tallest residential buildings after it was engulfed in flames in the early hours of this morning in Dubai.

Pictures and video footage showed a large blaze ripping through multiple floors of the Marina Torch tower, a new tower in the expat-heavy Marina district of the city.

More than a dozen fire trucks were able to extinguish the flames several hours after the fire alarm went off around 2am local time.

One eyewitness said flames shot out from two sides of the building as glass and metal rained down from near the summit of the 86-storey skyscraper, which stands more 330 metres tall (1,105 ft).

Inferno: A massive blaze ripped through multiple storeys of the 86-storey Marina Torch tower in Dubai early Saturday

Disaster: The fire broke out early Saturday in the Torch tower on the northeastern end of the Marina district

Horror: The fire which is believed to have started on the 51st floor engulfed dozens of storeys in the skyscraper

Hazardous: The fire broke out at about 2am local time on the north-east end of the densely populated district

Kiera Doherty was asleep in her apartment in the Torch when the fire broke out. The 32-year-old told MailOnline: 'Alarms are always going off in Dubai and so I normally ignore them.

'I got a call from a friend saying "you have got to get out, the building is on fire".

'I was rushing down the stairs but because the fire was on the lower floor, I realised I was walking into the smoke. The further down I got on the stairs, the thicker the smoke got.

'There was an elderly lady taking it one step and a time and people carrying babies. I live on the 56th floor and it took about 20 minutes to get all the way down.

'Because there was so much burning cladding coming off the side of the building, falling onto the street, we couldn't get out.

'There was a gap in the falling cladding and I ran across the road. A piece of burning cladding fell on my shoulder.  

And Melanie Parkes, a British teacher who lives in the building, said 'there were huge pieces of debris falling and being carried by the wind'.

She added: 'It was a really surreal experience, especially when we actually saw the fire outside. Mostly people were in shock and some were even crying. It looked like something out of film set.'

Scorched: The flammable cladding on the outside of the building was incinerated in the blaze and crashed down to the ground below

Beacon: Dozens of stories in the 86-storey Torch skyscraper left several apartments severely damaged

Aftermath: Two men inspect the damage on the decimated balcony of one of the apartments in the Torch

Damage: Parts of the flammable cladding - which fell and set fire to lower parts of the building - fell on resident's balconies

Falling debris: Even the apartments that bore no visible signs of damage were littered with charred cladding

British ex-pat Sharjeel Khawaja from London, who lives on the 26th floor, told 7 Days In Dubai that ignored the fire alarm because he thought it was coming from the construction site nearby.

He said: 'I woke up around 6am to find missed calls from my family and a mate that lives in the same building.

'I went out into the corridor and the sprinklers were on and there was water everywhere.

'When I got outside [on the street] everyone was gathered around watching what was happening. I must have been one of the last out of the building.'

The director of Dubai Civil Defence, said: 'The incident proved Dubai Civil Defence's ability to control the fire and stop it from spreading to the tower's other wings and to nearby buildings by following strict protocols to break in quickly and reach the source of the fire on the 51st floor.'

As daylight broke, residents waiting to check the extent of the damage at their homes could see the external cladding on the corners of the building was charred black and mangled for dozens of floors.  

Clean-up crews dressed in orange uniforms swept up pieces of shattered glass and other debris covering the street outside the building. 

Safety risk: Police blocked off areas around the Torch, which still had power, and the lights were on in many of the flats

Alert: Two residents of the Torch (not pictured) said they were told the fire started around the 52nd floor

Emergency: A resident of the Marina Torch, Steve Short, 53, of Liverpool, praised the work of firefighters who arrived quickly

Destruction: High winds whipped through the area and debris from the fire cluttered nearby streets after the blaze appeared to be extinguished

Evacuation: Thousands of residents abandoned the high-rise Marina Torch and the neighboring buildings when it caught on fire and debris began falling all around

Major General Rashid Al Matroushi said around 100 officers from nine civil defence stations took part in putting out the blaze.

Two residents of the Torch, who were evacuated from the building, were told the fire started on the 52nd floor. They said the flaming material fell and set lower parts of the building ablaze. 

Steve Short, 53, of Liverpool, praised the work of firefighters who arrived quickly. He said fire alarms alerted residents to the blaze and building management sent workers knocking on doors to ensure residents got out. 

Residents of at least one neighboring tower were told to evacuate as a precaution because of strong winds, but they were later allowed back inside.

Another resident of The Torch said residents were nervous coming out but fire crews were able to bring the situation under control.

33-year-old RJ Morlock said: 'I was really surprised they got it under control pretty quickly,' he said. 'It looked like it was going to go up.'

The blaze spread through at least 15 floors as high winds whipped through the area, on the northeastern end of the densely populated Marina district. 

Police blocked off areas around the skyscraper, which still had power during the fire and lights were on in many of the apartments inside.

Debris from the fire cluttered nearby streets after the blaze was extinguished. Police on the scene had no immediate reports of deaths or injuries. 

Thousands were evacuated after the blaze, which reportedly started on the 51st floor, spread quickly

He said: 'There have been three fire alarms every week recently and all were false. This time I heard it and said it must be false. 

'But then I smelt smoke. I took my wallet and ran down along with my wife.'

Digby Taylor, head of operations at GN Broadcasting, added: 'This building has been plagued since opening with false fire alarms on an almost daily basis.' 

The Marina area is home to dozens of towering apartment blocks and hotels, many of them built over the past decade. The apartments are popular with Dubai's large number of expatriate professionals.

Tamweel blaze: According to Gulf Business , some experts blamed faulty air-conditioning caused the accident while others have said sub-standard cladding material caused the blaze

As daylight broke in Dubai this morning, the external cladding on the corners of the Marina Torch building were mangled and charred black.

In November 2012, experts blamed the same external coating for the inferno that engulfed another luxury Dubai development known as the Jumeirah Lake Towers (JLT).

The blaze at the 34-storey Tamweel Tower forced a mass evacuation of residents who lost all their worldly belongings.

According to Gulf Business, some experts blamed faulty air-conditioning caused the accident while others have said sub-standard cladding material caused the blaze.

'As is evident from the videos, the fire started at the roof of building, and that might have been due to a short-circuit or over heating of any of the equipments installed on the roof,'  Noman Qamar, project manager at fire protection company Aldes, told Gulf Business.

He added: 'The fire spread rapidly to other parts of the building mainly due to falling debris of the flammable cladding that was used on the tower, which is similar to other incidences that occurred in other residential towers.'

The tower's cladding burned downwards in the early hours of Sunday morning, making hundreds of residents homeless, The National reported at the time.

The Dubai Police forensic department has released its findings on the fire, which burnt half the building.

According to the report, the fire started at the back of the building on the ground floor where the waste material was left by the labourers working on a shop in the building. The waste material contained papers, tapes and woods which fuelled the
