Thai Airways painted over its logo and name on a plane that crash-landed on a runway in a bid to protect the airline's image.

The Airbus 330-300 skidded as it was coming into Bangkok's main airport at around 11pm.

Thirteen people were injured while evacuating the plane, which was arriving from Guangzhou, China when it fell off the runway at Suvarnabhumi airport.

Blackout: The logo and name of the Airbus 330-300 were covered up by workers

Crash: A functioning Thai Airways plane takes off with its logos in full sight while the damaged Airbus waits on the runway at Suvarnabhumi International Airport

Emergency: Slides had to be deployed so passengers and crew could escape the plane, and 14 people were injured

Officials said there had been a malfunction in the gearbox of the plane, which was carrying 288 passengers and 14 crew members.

Following the incident, workers on a crane blacked out the Thai Airways logo on the tail and body of the aircraft.

Thai Airways official Smud Poom-On said that 'blurring the logo' after an accident was a recommendation from Star Alliance known as the 'crisis communication rule', meant to protect the image of both the airline and other members of Star Alliance.

The incident occurred less than two weeks after 20 passengers were injured when a Thai Airways Airbus A380 hit severe turbulence as it was descending to Hong Kong airport.

Skid: Marks in the grass around the runway showed how the plane slipped as it landed in Bangkok on the flight from Guangzhou

Malfunction: One runway had to be closed at the airport due to the accident, which officials put down to faulty gears

Thai Airways covered up the airline’s 
logo and name on one of its planes after it crashed while landing, in a 
bid to protect its image.

Thai Airways president Sorajak Kasemsuvan said in a statement that the landing gear had malfunctioned.

A spokesman said the incident was under investigation, but it was too early to comment on what exactly caused the accident.
