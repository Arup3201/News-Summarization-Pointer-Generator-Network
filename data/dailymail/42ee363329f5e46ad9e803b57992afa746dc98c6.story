Texas Governor Rick Perry announced today his intentions to deploy up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to his state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico.

'There
can be no national security without border security, and Texans have paid too
high a price for the federal government’s failure to secure our border,' the Republican Governor said at a news conference this afternoon.

'The action I am ordering today will tackle this crisis head-on by
multiplying our efforts to combat the cartel activity, human traffickers and
individual criminals who threaten the safety of people across Texas and
America.'

According to a memo leaked late last night to The Monitor, the executive action will cost Texas taxpayers $12 million a month.

Done waiting around: Texas Governor Rick Perry said this afternoon that he is deploying up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico

Already, Perry has instructed the Texas Department of Public Safety to increase personnel in the Rio Grande River Valley area at a weekly cost of $1.3 million.

Added together, the two measures will cost $5 million a week, the memo reportedly states, and 'it is not clear where the money will come 
from in the budget' other than 'non critical' areas like health care or transportation.

The rise in border protection measures follows a surge of Central American children streaming into the U.S. from Mexico.

More than 57,000 immigrant children, many of whom are unaccompanied, have illegally entered the country since last year, and the government estimates that approximately 90,000 will arrive by the close of this year.

U.S. Border Patrol has been overloaded by the deluge, and the federal government is quickly running out of money to care for the children.

Congress is in the process of reviewing a $3.7 billion emergency funding request from President Barack Obama that would appropriate additional money to the agencies involved, but House Republicans remain skeptical of the president's plan.

Roughly half of the money Obama's asking for would go toward providing humanitarian aid to the children while relatively little would go toward returning the them to their home countries.

Furthermore, Republicans would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the government to give children from non-contiguous countries who show up at the border health screenings and due process before they can be sent home. The judicial process often takes months, and even years, clogging up courts and slowing down the repatriation process.

The president had initially planned to include a revised version of the 2008 legislation in his request to Congress that would have allowed the Department of Homeland Security to exercise the 'discretion' to bypass the current process by giving children the option to voluntarily return home. Obama backed down at the last minute after receiving negative feedback from Democratic lawmakers.

Perry held a news conference with Attorney General Greg Abbott, right, this afternoon in Austin, Texas, to formally announce the deployment. Perry said the National Guard troops were needed to combat criminals that are exploiting a surge of children and families entering the U.S. illegally

Also not included in Obama's request to Congress was funding for a National Guard deployment to the border - something House Speaker John Boehner and the Texas Governor had both called on the president to do.

Republicans say a National Guard presence is needed at areas of high crime to help Border Patrol agents crack down on smugglers and drug cartels.

In a face to face meeting with Obama when the president came to Texas two weeks ago Perry again asked the president to deploy the National Guard through a federally funded statue but Obama resisted.

Perry is now taking matters into his own hands, sending his own set of troops down to the Rio Grande Valley to aid law enforcement officials.

State Senator Juan 'Chuy' Hinojosa, a Democrat who represents border town McAllen, criticized the Republican Governor's deployment as unnecessary.

'[The cartels] are taking advantage of the situation,' he told the Monitor. 'But our local law enforcement from the sheriff’s offices of the different counties to the different police departments are taking care of the situation.

'This is a civil matter, not a military matter. What we need is more resources to hire more deputies, hire more Border Patrol,' Hinojosa said. 'These are young people, just families coming across. They're not armed. They're not carrying weapons.'

The leaked memo on the National Guard deployment specifically denies that it is a 'militarization of the border,' however. And Perry's office reiterated today that troops would 'work seamlessly and side by side with law enforcement officials.'

Hinojosa also accused Perry, who recently toured the border with Sean Hannity as part of a special for Fox News, of being insincere in his concern about the situation at the border.

'All
 these politicians coming down to border, they don't care about solving 
the problem, they just want to make a political point,' he said.
