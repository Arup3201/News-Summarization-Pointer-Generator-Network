Brazil battled back from a goal down to beat France 3-1 in Thursday's international friendly at the Stade de France.

The hosts took an early lead thanks to Raphael Varane's thumping header but were pegged back thanks to goals from Oscar, Neymar and Luiz Gustavo.

Here Sportsmail's Luke Augustus provides his player ratings from the clash in Paris.

FRANCE (4-3-3)

Steve Mandanda - 6.5

Made good saves from Neymar, Roberto Firmino and Luiz Gustavo - and could do little about the former's brilliant goal, even if he was beaten at his near post.

Bacary Sagna - 5.5

Given a tough time at right back when Neymar drifted over to the left to combine with Oscar.

Raphael Varane - 6

Scored the opening goal of the match with a bullet header - his second  for his country. Lost Luiz Gustavo for Brazil's third though.

Mamadou Sakho - 6

Kept Firmino quiet but will be disappointed to be part of a back line that conceded three times.

Patrice Evra - 6

Fared better than Sagna on the opposite flank and was willing to get forward at any opportunity.

Moussa Sissoko - 6

Had a quiet game in midfield and was replaced in the second half by Geoffrey Kondogbia. 

Morgan Schneiderlin - 6.5

Broke up play nicely in midfield for Les Bleus. Only his eighth cap for France but looks assured at international level.

Blaise Matuidi - 6

Like Sissoko, the Paris-Saint Germain star had a quiet game in midfield. He seemed to lack his box-to-box dynamism on Thursday night. 

Antoine Griezmann - 6.5

Was neat and tidy in possession but failed to carve open the Brazil back line.

Mathieu Valbuena - 7

Provided the assist for Varane's goal from the corner. Impressed in the first half with his constant movement and his deliveries throughout the game caused the Brazil defence a lot of problems.

Karim Benzema - 4.5

Captained his country for the first-time ever. Should have scored early on from close range and missed a glorious chance in the second half. Failed to get into the match overall.

Subs

Geoffrey Kondogbia (on for Sissoko, 74 mins) - 5.5

Failed to make to make an impact in the match when he came on. 

Nabil Fekir (on for  Griezmann 74) - 6

Made his debut for France and came close to scoring with a long range effort late on.

Dimitri Payet (on for  Valbuena 82) - N/A

Olivier Giroud (on for  Matuidi 84) - N/A

Brazil (4-4-2)

Jefferson - 6.5

Produced a brilliant save to deny a Benzema header on seven minutes and made a fine save to deny Griezmann from long range too.

Danilo - 6.5

Made a good recovery tackle on Benzema early in the second half and was solid in defence.

Thiago Silva - 7

First start for his country since the World Cup third-place play-off and fitted in seamlessly.

Miranda - 6.5

Lost Varane for France's opener and was beaten in the air to boot. Recovered though to keep the hosts at bay afterwards.

Filipe Luis - 6.5

Hasn't had much game time at Chelsea recently but any rustiness didn't show against the French. 

Willian - 7.5 - STAR MAN

Got into the game more the longer it wore on. Provided the assist for Neymar and Luiz Gustavo's goals.

Elias - 6.5

Effectively broke up play for the visitors and screened the defence well.

Luiz Gustavo - 6.5

Had a relatively quiet game in midfield but found himself free inside the France penalty area to add a third goal for Dunga's side.

Oscar - 7

Scored Brazil's equaliser with a brilliant piece of play involving Firmino and became more influential in the second half.

Neymar - 7

Dropped deeper as the game wore on to get involved in the play more. Was having a quiet game but produced a moment of magic to score Brazil's second.

Roberto Firmino - 6

Provided the assist for Oscar's opener but was a peripheral figure come the second half.

Subs

Douglas Costa (on for Willian 84) - N/A

Souza (on for Oscar 86) - N/A

Luiz Adriano (on for Firmino 88) - N/A

Fernandinho (on for Gustavo 90) - N/A

Neymar (centre) gave Brazil the lead with a stunning left-footed effort in the second half
