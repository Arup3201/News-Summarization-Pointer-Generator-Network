Vibrio bacteria can cause gastroenteritis and cholera in humans

Normally found growing in warm and tropical waters, the bacteria now thrives in the Baltic Sea as a result of rising temperatures caused by climate change, scientists say

A temperature rise of one degree resulted in a 200 per cent increase in the number of Vibrio cases

Chances of getting a Vibrio infection still 'relatively low', say experts

Thriving: Vibrio bacteria strains will continue to appear in new areas as ocean temperatures rise, experts say

The unexpected outbreak of a group of bacteria in northern Europe that can cause infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis is largely down to man-made climate change, new research shows.

A study by a group of international experts has provided some of the first firm evidence that the warming patterns of the Baltic Sea have coincided with the emergence of Vibrio infections in northern Europe.

Vibrios - a group of bacteria that is normally found growing in warm and tropical marine environments - can cause an array of infections in humans ranging from cholera to gastroenteritis-like symptoms from eating raw or undercooked shellfish, or from exposure to seawater.

Symptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea and stomach cramps.

A team of scientists from Britain, Finland, Spain and the U.S. found the number and distribution of Vibrio cases in the Baltic sea area was strongly linked to peaks in sea surface temperatures.

Each year the temperature rose one degree, the number of Vibrio cases rose almost 200 per cent.

'The big apparent increases that we've seen during heat wave years...tend to indicate that climate change is indeed driving infections,' Craig Baker-Austin from the UK-based Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science told Reuters.

The team of scientists examined sea surface temperature records and satellite data, as well as statistics on Vibrio cases in the Baltic.

Climate studies show that rising greenhouse gas emissions made global average surface temperatures increase by about 0.17 degrees Celsius per decade from 1980 to 2010.

The scientists focused on the Baltic Sea in particular because it warmed at an unprecedented rate of 0.063 to 0.078 degrees Celsius a year from 1982 to 2010, or 6.3 to 7.8 degrees a century.

'(It) represents, to our knowledge, the fastest warming marine ecosystem examined so far anywhere on earth,' said the paper, which was published in the journal Nature Climate Change on Sunday.

Many marine bacteria thrive in warm, low-saline sea water.

Climate change has also resulted in more frequent and heavier rainfall, which has reduced the salt content of estuaries and coastal wetlands.

As ocean temperatures continue to rise and coastal regions in northern areas become less saline, Vibrio bacteria strains will appear in new areas, the scientists said.

Vibrio outbreaks have also been recorded in temperate and cold regions in Chile, Peru, Israel, the northwest U.S. Pacific and northwest Spain, and these can be linked to warming patterns, according to the research team.

'Very few studies have looked at the risk of these infections at high latitudes,' Mr Baker-Austin said.

'Certainly the chances of getting a Vibrio infection are considered to be relatively low, and more research is focused on areas where these diseases are endemic or at least more common,' he added.

Previous Vibrio outbreaks in colder regions have often been put down to a sporadic event or special conditions rather than a response to long-term climate change.

This is because the effects of global warming can be more pronounced at higher latitudes and in areas which lack detailed historical climate data, the study said.

The scientist said there was a growing awareness that climate and the emergence of some infectious diseases are closely linked, but added that there are 'huge data gaps in that area which need addressing'.
