NBC's Matt Lauer has been denied an interview with recently convicted kidnapper and rapist Ariel Castro and turned away from the Ohio prison where Castro is being held.

Lauer traveled to Cleveland to conduct a jailhouse interview with Castro, who was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years for his crimes against Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight. 

Instead, Lauer's request was declined by Cuyahoga County Sheriff Frank Bova in no uncertain terms.

Scoop: Reporter Scott Taylor first tweeted news of Matt Lauer's failed interview attempt

Scott Taylor, an investigative reporter for 19 Action News in Cleveland tweeted the news yesterday, writing '@MLauer of @todayshow spotted at jail here in Cleveland asking for #ArielCastro interview. Sheriff Bova said NO'.

According to Taylor, Sheriff Bova told him, 'I won't allow it,' and that 'an Ariel Castro interview from jail isn’t going to happen in Cleveland.'

A spokesperson for Sheriff Bova said that the reason Lauer was denied the interview was because Castro was being moved yesterday to Lorain Correctional Institution in Grafton, Ohio.

'Matt Lauer arrived at the jail on Friday
morning and his interview request was denied. Castro is leaving the 
building today and the interview was declined for security purposes,' 
she said.

Monster: Many Twitter users expressed relief that Lauer didn't get an interview with Castro, saying the kidnapper doesn't deserve any more airtime

A spokesperson for Ohio's prisons department says Castro will be isolated from the greater prison population for his own safety at the beginning of his sentence due to the high profile nature of his case.

Castro's lawyers struck a deal with prosecutors that spared him the death sentence but also spared his victims having to testify in court, pleading guilty to aggravated murder, kidnapping and rape on Thursday.

NBC's Today show has declined to comment on the incident, but Twitter users are speculating about Lauer's interview techniques.

@LovinTheTribe wrote, 'Did Castro agree to interview first? Was wondering why Lauer just showed up?'

According to Taylor, the Today show had already secured the interview.

'MY SOURCE: @MLauer & @todayshow had green light for interview with #ArielCastro today but County Sheriff Frank Bova pulled the plug,' he wrote.
