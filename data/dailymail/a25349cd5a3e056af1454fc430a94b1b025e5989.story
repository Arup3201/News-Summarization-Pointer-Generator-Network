A man has been indicted for first-degree murder two years after his wife mysteriously plunged 50 feet to her death as they hiked in Rocky Mountain National Park.

Harold Henthorn, 58, was arrested near his Douglas County, Colorado home on Thursday by the National Park Service and the FBI and is due in Denver federal court on Thursday afternoon. 

Henthorn had told authorities that his wife, Dr Toni Henthorn, 50, accidentally fell as she prepared to take a photograph during their anniversary hike on Deer Mountain on September 29, 2012. 

The coroner concluded that he could not rule out homicide and the FBI launched an investigation.

Reports have since emerged showing that Dr Henthorn, who had one daughter, had life insurance policies to the value of $4.5 million - and that a claim was made on one of the policies just two days after her death.

The indictment says Harold Henthorn, who was the only witness to her death, 'willfully, deliberately, maliciously and with premeditation and malice aforethought did unlawfully kill his wife', CBS reported.

After she passed away, it emerged that his first wife had also died in mysterious circumstances, and the investigation into that death has since been re-opened.

Sandra Lynn Henthorn, 37, was crushed to death after the couple's car slipped off a jack while she and Harold Henthorn were trying to change a flat tire one late night  in 1995.

Mystery: Harold Henthorn told authorities his wife slipped on a steep mountainside while taking a photo 

He told authorities that his wife had been reaching under the car to help him change the front tire on their Jeep Cherokee on the rural road, when the jack slipped.

Detectives closed the case just one week after the investigation, ruling the death an accident, but the Douglas County Sheriff's Office told CBS4 that they have now re-opened the investigation.

A source told the channel that Henthorn had taken out a $300,000 insurance policy on his wife.

It added that three life insurance policies had been taken out on his second wife - each valued at $1.5 million - and that efforts had been made to collect on it on the first business day after her death.

One of the policies named the Harold and Toni Henthorn Trust as the beneficiary and a claim was sent in for the policy on October 1, 2012, CBS reported. No payment was made, however.

It is not clear who attempted to file a claim for the policy. The claim was made before her body was cremated or a memorial service was held.

Dr Henthorn, an ophthalmologist, had been married to her husband for 12 years. She left behind a daughter, then seven.

Toni Henthorn's family told CBS4 that they learned of her husband's arrest on Thursday morning.

Her brother Todd Bertolet  expressed relief that federal authorities had made an arrest.

'We've always had the utmost confidence in very talented people with the FBI and the National Park Service,' he said.

'We've always felt that justice would come one day and this is a satisfactory day in knowing that justice for Toni is proceeding along.'

Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig Truman, added: 'We know when all the facts are known in this difficult case that justice will be done.'

If convicted, Henthorn faces a mandatory life sentence in prison with no possibility of parole and a fine of up to $250,000.
