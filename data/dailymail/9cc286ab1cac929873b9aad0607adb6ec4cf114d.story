Christian Atsu can be Everton’s secret weapon in the second half of the season, says Roberto Martinez.

The Ghana winger, on loan at Goodison Park from Chelsea, has only played in two Premier League matches for the struggling Toffees so far.

But boss Martinez believes Atsu has needed time to bed in to the English game, and expects big things from him as the campaign goes on.

Christian Atsu can be Everton's secret weapo in the second half of the season, says Roberto Martinez

Roberto Martinez likes the winger's qualities and says he will get used to the Premier League

‘We need to give him a little bit of time to adapt to the physicality of the Premier League just like any player but especially a winger,’ Martinez told the Liverpool Echo.

‘In other leagues referees allow less contact and they are a bit more protected.

‘But I think the way he has adapted to the way we want to play so far has been impressive. He’s an intelligent footballer.

‘It’s just making sure I can give him the right introduction to his role. With the minutes he’s had so far in the Europa League and other games he’s done well.

‘I expect him to be himself in the second half of the season and he can be a very important player for us.’
