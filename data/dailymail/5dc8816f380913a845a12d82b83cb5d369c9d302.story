It was far from a typical wedding and even farther from what Kristi Warriner envisioned her big day would be like.

But according to the Texas bride and mom, it was even better. They married in the neonatal intensive care unit so their son, which was born 15 weeks early, could be the ring-bearer.

Warriner and her fiance, Justin Nelson, lost one of their twins when she went into labor 15 weeks early at Fort Worth hospital on September 2, according to The Star-Telegram.

Their surviving son, J.J., was 'touch and go' for weeks, weighing less than two pounds at birth.

Best day: Kristi Warriner and Justin Nelson look at their son, J.J. after they were married in the Cook Children's Medical Center NICU in Fort Worth on Tuesday

Happily married: The couple, along with eight-year-old daughter Carissa and little J.J., celebrate after the ceremony, which was planned with the help of hospital staff

But J.J. now weighs 6 pounds, 8 ounces and appears to be improving each day.

Knowing the couple wanted to wed but had been too busy caring for their preemie son for the last two months, the staff Cook Children’s staff helped arrange the couple a wedding ceremony at the hospital.

Local businesses donated the bride’s wedding gown and flowers.

One of family’s friends lent the outfit for tiny ring-bearer J.J. to wear.

'It’s not what you dream of as a little girl - it’s even better,' Mrs Nelson told The Star-Telegram after the nuptials.

'I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect wedding.'

Of great importance to the bride and groom was representing the son they lost at the ceremony, who they named Colt.

In Colt's place was a Dallas Cowboys teddy bear that they sat next to J.J.

Little fighter: J.J. Nelson is getting stronger each day. His parents put this teddy bear in next to him as a representation of J.J.'s twin brother, who they named Colt but who died in premature labor

'We thank God every day for J.J. getting better and stronger,' Mrs Nelson said.

'Our biggest mission with all this was to help others know they are not alone.

'I hope we’ve touched somebody’s life and let them know there is hope after tragedy.'

The family and doctors at Cook Children's hope J.J. will be allowed home around Christmas.
