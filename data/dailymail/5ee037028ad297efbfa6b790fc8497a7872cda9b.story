Motorists are putting lives at risk by hacking into safety mechanisms in their  luxury cars to allow them to watch television as they drive.

Many luxury vehicles include TV systems on their dashboards that are designed to work only when the car is not moving.

However, an electronic device costing as little as £150 allows drivers to disable the safety mechanism so they can have the set working while driving.

In car entertainment: Many new vehicles include TV systems on their dashboards that are designed to work only when the car is not moving. However devices can now be purchased to disable the safety mechanism

Some motorists are even resorting to a DIY option of fixing tablet computers to their dashboards so they can watch via Wi-Fi.

Groups such as the AA now fear that the problem will grow as the increasingly sophisticated electronics in cars become more affordable and trickle down to less  expensive makes.

Road safety minister Robert Goodwill said: 'It is absolutely vital that drivers give their full attention to the road.

DVD players have appeared in vehicles for a number of years, although usually in the back seats

'Watching TV whilst driving is irresponsible, dangerous and stupid because it puts other road users at risk.

'Any motorist caught by police will be severely penalised.'

AA president Edmund King said: ‘It is outrageous and irresponsible for companies to sell devices solely to override safety features built into the car. It is also very stupid for drivers to buy these devices.’
