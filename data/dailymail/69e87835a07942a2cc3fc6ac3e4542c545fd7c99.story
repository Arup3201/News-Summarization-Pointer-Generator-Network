A group of cross-dressing performers are pictured getting dolled up for a night on stage in China's Guangxi Province.

From the overweight to the ageing, each man is transformed into a sparkling showgirl with the help of false eyelashes, some clever corsetry and long flowing wigs.

The Chinese drag queens represent a movement in the Communist state for growing acceptance towards varying forms of sexual expression.

They are pictured sitting together as well as taking some alone time backstage as they get ready and hype themselves up for a performance  at the Chunai 98 club.

A drag queen who goes by the stage name Caomei is pictured candidly taking a moment to fan his makeup dry and adjust his corset backstage before performing.

Once he affixes a fuchsia marabou feather headpiece, he looks strikingly feminine and ladylike. 

Meanwhile, a much older drag queen called Shancun is pictured swinging on a pole and flipping his hair on his knees onstage, while dressed in over-the-knee PVC boots.

The series of photos, taken earlier this month in Nanning, southern China, shows how views on sexuality are slowly evolving in modern China.

Chunai 98 presents a rare showcase of performances by the small group of cross-dressing Chinese men, who have slowly gained some local acceptance.

Many of the performers come from small cities in other provinces, having left their families in search of acceptance, employment and a sense of community. 

A drag queen is traditionally a man who dresses and acts with exaggerated, pantomime femininity for comic or satirical effect. 

In China, theatrical cross-dressing is on the rise along with, some speculate, more open views on varying forms of gender identity.
