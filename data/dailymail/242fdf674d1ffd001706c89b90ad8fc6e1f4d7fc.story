Marco Reus can become a legend like Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard by rejecting the advances of more successful teams to save Dortmund, according to the club's chief executive.

The 25-year-old was expected by many to leave the ailing club in the summer, but on Tuesday he signed a new four-year £145,000-a-week contract.

Jurgen Klopp's side beat Freiburg 3-0 in their last match but remain just one point off the bottom of the Bundesliga after a catastrophic season so far.

And while cynics would suggest the new contract is merely a way of ensuring Dortmund can sell for a high price in the summer, the club's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke sees things differently.

'If you decide for your club in such a situation, you are down at the bottom of the table, you have offers from the biggest clubs on earth, but nevertheless you decide for your club, thus resigning a lot of financial conditions, that are those players who will be later legends in their clubs,' said Watzke

'Just like Uwe Seeler, who didn't go (from Hamburg) to Inter Milan, also other players, like (Steven) Gerrard at Liverpool.

'And now there is also the possibility, especially in the case of Marco, who is born here in this city.'
