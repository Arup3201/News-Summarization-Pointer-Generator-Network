Inflation fell slightly today, but remained far above the Government's target thanks to yet another increase in energy bills.

The Consumer Price Index rate of inflation was five per cent for October, down from 5.2 per cent in September, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The Retail Price Index rate, which is more closely linked to the costs of home ownership, fell to 5.4 per cent from 5.6 per cent the previous month.

The fall in inflation reflects last month's 'price war' between major retailers, which saw them aggressively cut food and petrol prices in an attempt to compete with each other.

Bank of England: Inflation remains well above the Bank's target of two per cent

Despite the fall, CPI is still more than double 
the target of two per cent, meaning that the governor of the Bank of 
England will have to write an explanatory letter for the eighth 
consecutive quarter.

The high inflation was driven by energy prices once again as increases from Npower came into effect, following previous rises from British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power and E.ON and ahead of a similar move from EDF this month.

Heavy discounting from food retailers - including the UK's biggest supermarkets, which have been engaged in an aggressive price war - has slightly eased overall prices.

But the figure was still high enough to trigger a letter of explanation from Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King to the Chancellor - his eighth quarter in a row and 13th in total.

Sir Mervyn, who will be at Buckingham 
Palace today to be formally knighted by the Queen, has previously 
forecast inflation to surpass five per cent before coming down rapidly 
over the next year.

Both CPI and RPI have remained fairly high over the last couple of years

The 
Bank is expected to slash its forecasts for growth and inflation in its 
quarterly inflation report tomorrow, as a raft of key indicators suggest
that the economy might head into reverse.

The
weaker growth outlook is likely to push down the inflation projection -
but this will be slightly offset by the impact of the £75billion round 
of quantitative easing unleashed in October.

However, good economic news came 
today as it was announced that both France and Germany had seen 
significant rises in GDP during the third quarter of 2011.

Sir Mervyn said the Bank is now faced with the possibility of inflation undershooting the two per cent target due to 'substantial risks around the global economic recovery and the implications of a further slowdown in the world economy for the UK.'

Germany's economy grew by 0.5 per cent from July to September, while France's grew by 0.4 per cent in that period.

In the UK, gas and electricity bills applied the most significant upward pressure on the overall rate of inflation in October, rising 1.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively over the course of the month.

In total, energy bills have risen by 19.9 per cent over the last year as they have driven stubbornly high levels of overall inflation.

Food prices had the most significant downward impact to the change in CPI between September and October as they fell 0.9 per cent.

The ONS said 'significant and 
widespread discounting by supermarkets' pushed prices down, as well as a
strong harvest for certain products.

Vegetable
prices fell 2.4 per cent, fruit eased 1.6 per cent, milk, cheese and 
eggs dropped 1.2 per cent and meat edged down 0.7 per cent.

Tesco triggered a price war with its rivals in October with its £500million Big Price Drop campaign.

Competitors
soon responded with their own schemes, including Sainsbury's Brand 
Match campaign, while Asda slashing prices at the petrol pumps.

This made shop price inflation fall back markedly to 2.1 per cent from 2.7 per cent, according to the British Retail Consortium.

Price cutting: Heavy discounts from major supermarkets has contributed to October's fall in inflation

There were signs of further relief as Debenhams launched its annual five-day pre-Christmas promotion with £200million savings with price cuts of up to 40% in stores and online.

BRC director general Stephen Robertson said it was a sign retailers were responding to households' severely strained budgets.

He said: 'With consumers' budgets under severe pressure, competition between retailers has intensified. Supermarkets are cutting their already thin margins even further to hold down shop prices in the face of rising energy and property costs.'

A six per cent fall in air fares and a slight 0.4 per cent dip in petrol pump prices also helped bring the overall CPI rate down. The average price of petrol was £1.34 in October, the lowest since July.

The cost of air travel could rise again, however, as airlines are hit by the high price of fuel.

Budget
carrier easyJet warned today that its fuel costs were set to rise by 
£220million, having already increased by £100million over the last year.

Today's data was published as Prime Minister David Cameron faced a damaging Commons revolt by Tory backbenchers over rising fuel prices.

A Treasury spokesman said: 'Whilst price inflation eased slightly in October, the Government recognises that these are difficult times for households as prices continue to be affected by conditions in the global oil and gas markets.

'The Bank of England has forecast that inflation should fall rapidly over 2012 but, in the meantime, the Government is taking action to help consumers with current high costs, including cutting fuel duty and freezing council tax.'

Labour Treasury spokesman Owen Smith said: 'Families and pensioners are really feeling the squeeze because the VAT rise and the Government's failure to act on soaring energy prices are pushing up inflation.

'With Britain now having the highest inflation of any EU country except Estonia, it's time out-of-touch ministers started taking some responsibility and took action now.

'Reversing January's VAT rise temporarily, as part of Labour's five-point plan for jobs, would ease the squeeze on families and help to kick-start our flatlining economy. It would cut petrol prices by 3p a litre and give a couple with children an average boost of £450 a year.'

TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said high prices meant families were facing a tough Christmas.

He said: 'The small ease in inflation will provide some comfort for families but until wages keep up with prices, people's real incomes will continue to deteriorate.'

However, most economists said the figures were likely to represent the start of a marked downward trend in the rate of inflation.

Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: 'Fingers crossed, October's drop in inflation should mean that we have now passed the peak in inflation. The start of 2012 should see inflation begin to fall back sharply and we think that it will be below the 2% target within a year.'
