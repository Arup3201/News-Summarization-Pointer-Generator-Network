A secret desert camp used by Lawrence of Arabia has been found intact almost 100 years after he left it.

The hideout in modern-day Jordan was still littered with spent cartridges and broken gin bottles when a team of archaeologists found it - thanks to an RAF pilot's vaguely-sketched map.

It was used as a vital base by Thomas Edward Lawrence, the British intelligence officer who would pass into legend for his guerilla raids against Turkish forces in the First World War.

Find: British archaeologists have found a secret desert camp used by TE Lawrence, pictured, almost 100 years after he left it with a campfire and empty tins of food still intact. His biographer called it a 'time capsule'

But the camp would have gone unnoticed for many years more had it not been for a chance discovery in the National Archives.

John
 Winterburn, an archaeologist at Bristol University, found a 
loosely-sketched map from 1918 by a pilot who recalled the camp from 
memory after a reconnaisance flight.

He
 scoured through images on Google Earth to find a part of the desert 
which matched the drawing in a 10-year investigation called the Arab 
Revolt Project.

Finally he 
found the small camp, which Lawrence said was 'behind the toothed hill 
facing Tell Shahm station', in November 2012 exactly where he predicted 
it would be.

Accompanied by 
project directors Nicholas Saunders and Neil Faulkner, both based at 
Bristol, he found ashes still in a camp fire and broken biscuit boxes 
strewn across the 100-yard square.

Mr
 Faulkner told MailOnline: 'When you're talking about the field of 
modern conflict archaeology, it's the closest we can get to finding 
Tutankhamun's tomb.

The relics included a steel hawser clamp for holding or gripping steel rope (left) and gin bottle fragments (right)

'What was extraordinary was that we 
didn't expect to find anything on site. Our assumption was that we'd go 
there and find nothing but at least we knew where it was.

'We were looking up at the landscape rather than down, then suddenly John said: "I think that looks like a broken rum jar".

'The whole site was meticulously excavated and recorded and we pieced together fragments of the rum jar into a whole.

'It was incredibly exciting to be there and so very, very close to where Lawrence himself was.

'In
 his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom he has this very vivid description of 
eating bully beans and biscuits and drinking tea with condensed milk, 
watching the sparks rising into the night from the brushwood fire.

'We even found the ashes from that fire. It was astonishing.'

Mr Winterburn said finding the camp took him four years from start to finish.

The
 breakthrough came, he said, when he combined the sketch map with a 
photograph of soldiers standing with armoured Rolls-Royces next to a 
distinctive hill.

'I 
immediately recognised what it could be and put the pieces together,' he
 told MailOnline. 'I then used Google Earth to find a location 
precisely, and we logged the co-ordinates.

'We
 punched the data into a GPS receiver and marched across the desert, and
 there it was, exactly where we predicted. It's easy when you know how'.

He
 added: 'This camp had been used as a staging post for many for the epic
 raids on the Hejaz Railway at Tel Shahm and Mudawwara.

'Scattered in the desert floor 
was the remains of their last meals of rusty tin cans from 
Lowestoft and fragments of rum jars and gin bottles.'

Lawrence's authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson told the Sunday Times: 'It's a time capsule. Unlike on the western front, in the empty areas of the Middle East it just stays there.

'So you get a remarkable picture as if you have walked in the day after they left.'

TE Lawrence stayed at the camp in 1917 and 1918 and was joined by British officers who were used to a higher standard of accommodation - having driven across the desert in armoured Rolls-Royces.

The period in the desert would see some his most cunning attacks on Turkish supply routes, which provided a crucial distraction to Ottoman troops and allowed an Arab revolt to be victorious.

Legendary: TE Lawrence barefoot in the desert during the campaign. He was just 46 when he died

During the First World War the Turks, allied with 
Germany and facing the end of their old empire, were beset by an Arab 
revolt which Britain wanted the Arabs to win.

Gifted operator TE Lawrence would become a crucial part of that plan.

Born in north Wales in 1888, he learned 
Arabic on an archaeological dig in Syria.

As
 he spent three years there in the run-up to the war he became 
sympathetic to the Arab people, who had lived under the rule of the 
Turkish Ottoman empire for centuries.

When
 the war broke out in 1914, Lawrence became an intelligence officer 
based in Cairo and two years later the hostilities spread into an Arab 
revolt.

The British Colonel became the adviser to the son of the revolt's leader, Sherif Hussein of Mecca.

Renowned
 for his cunning tactics, Lawrence's small band of forces hit supply 
routes which distracted Turkish troops from the fighting they were 
supposed to be doing.

His
 efforts were vital in helping Sherif Hussein's forces win a victory 
which enabled them to establish a unified state spanning large parts of 
the Arabian peninsula.

The story would later be immortalised by Peter O'Toole in the epic 1962 
film Lawrence of Arabia.

After the war Winston Churchill appointed Lawrence as an adviser, but he quit the role as he hated the publicity it gave him.

The war hero died aged 46 in a motorcycle accident just three months after he left the RAF.
