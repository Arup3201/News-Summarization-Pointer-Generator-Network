One of those in custody was being held on suspicion of murdering 47-year-old Pennie Davis, who was knifed in broad daylight.

Another was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and the third with assisting an offender, Hampshire detectives said.

Mrs Davis, who had been married five times, was discovered lying in a paddock in Beaulieu on Tuesday afternoon by her husband of just four months, Pete Davis.

He was seen ‘sobbing his heart out’ next to her body.

More than 150 members of the public had responded to a police appeal for information to help find the killer.

Mrs Davis lived with her husband five miles from where she died in the village of Blackfield. She worked at a small branch of Sainsbury’s there.

Detectives admitted they faced a difficult job delving into Mrs Davis’s complex personal life, her business affairs and also her involvement as a director in several electrical companies in recent years.

A specialist police team was searching the River Beaulieu yards from the scene for a murder weapon.

Mrs Davis’s family declined to comment on the arrests.

One woman, who said she was a family member, said: ‘We don’t want to say anything that could sabotage the inquiry.’

This weekend more than 40,000 visitors, many unaware of the investigation, flocked to the New Forest for a giant two-day Autojumble motoring fair on the Beaulieu estate nearby.

They were met with police signs appealing for witnesses.

Speaking at the scene, Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, said Mrs Davis had been stabbed to death

News of the arrests was greeted with cautious optimism yesterday by staff at the Sainsbury’s where Mrs Davis worked.

One, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘We are all hoping there is a positive outcome. Justice must be done for this lovely woman.

‘It has been awful for such a small, close-knit community and especially her family.’

Mr Davis and his wife’s children Sophie, 20, Alex, 19, Georgia, 18, Daniel, 14, and Josef, 13, laid tributes in the field during the week.

Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, leading the team of 70 officers investigating the killing, said: ‘We have been working round the clock and we have had a fantastic reaction from the public with more than 150 calls so far.’

l A man charged with killing a great-grandmother in her London garden appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court yesterday. Nicholas Salvador, 25, of Gilda Avenue, Enfield, North London, is accused of attacking Palmira Silva, 82, with a machete at her home in Nightingale Road, Edmonton, on Thursday. Salvador did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody.
