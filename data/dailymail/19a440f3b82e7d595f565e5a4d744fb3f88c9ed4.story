With a beauty industry saturated with lotions and potions promising to turn back the clock, treating fine lines and pigmentation on our face is already enough of a minefield.

If the daily cleanse, tone and moisturise routine is already too much for you (and that's before you've even considered serums, toners and oils), it's about to get a lot more complicated.

New ranges of creams and serums targeted at beating hand wrinkles are starting to hit shelves so that beauty buffs can give their mitts the same attention as their faces. 

Another body part to worry about! With hands being one of the most tell-tale signs of ageing, new ranges of creams and serums targeted at beating hand wrinkles are being rolled out

But why do we need more products to add to our already lengthy beauty regime?

Here's why: As the years pass, skin on the hands thins, causing veins to become more prominent and liver spots to appear.

While make-up can disguise tell-tale signs of ageing on the face, it's more difficult with hands - which is why it's often said that hands are the best indicator of age. 

In fact, research by beauty firm No7 showed one in eight of us is more worried about our hands betraying our age than our faces. 

That's where a new host of potent products come in that are designed to plump hands, beat wrinkles and reduce dark spots. 

Damage done: As the years pass, skin on the hands thins, causing veins to become more prominent and liver spots to appear

New range: Mavala has a whole range of treatments aimed at hand health, such as the Repair Night Cream (£36.50), which is packed with the all-important hyaluronic acid and silk amino acids to help cell renewal and even a cleansing mask, right, to refresh hands

One of the newest power players on the market is Hand Chemistry - a brand dedicated to improving the firmness, elasticity, density, evenness, brightness, texture, smoothness and hydration of hands.

Their new Hyaluronic Concentrate has been formulated with a 19 per cent marine hyaluronic complex, which includes a 99.5 per cent pure hyaluronic acid - an ingredient well-known for providing incredible hydration to skin.

There's also lots of other potent ingredients packed in there such as red marina algae, which apparently increases cell turnover, as well as tamarind to hydrate skin below the surface.

Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Anti-Ageing Hand Cream (great for those on a budget at £3.99 from Boots), has been dermatologically proven to protect your hands from dryness whilst reducing some of the visible signs of ageing. 

The hand cream contains glycerin and shea butter to diffuse active moisture into the skin and with its exclusive soy complex, the formula claims to visibly reduce the appearance of brown spots.

Day and night: Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Anti-Ageing Hand Cream, which has been dermatologically proven to protect your hands from dryness whilst reducing some of the visible signs of ageing, is great for daytime wear, while E45's offering boots regeneration whilst you sleep

The E45 Repair & Protect Overnight Hand Cream also costs £3.99 and promises to enhance skin cell repair and regeneration overnight and helps protect skin’s natural defences.

Palmer’s £3.99 Eventone Age Spot Hand Cream helps reduce the appearance of dark spots and takes it one step further by helping to minimise the risk of further skin damages thanks to the built-in SPF.

Mavala has a whole range of treatments aimed at hand health. First up is the Mavala Repair Night Cream (£36.50), which is packed with the all-important hyaluronic acid and silk amino acids to help cell renewal and moisture retention. It even comes with specially designed cotton gloves to enclose hands after application to help the rich cream penetrate effectively while you sleep.

Potent: Hand Chemistry's new Hyaluronic Concentrate has been formulated with a 19 per cent marine hyaluronic complex,  that is well known for providing incredible hydration to skin

They also have a £22.25 Cleansing Mask for Hands aimed at benefiting dry and damaged hands. It contains  botanical extracts which remove impurities, refresh and invigorate, and aloe vera to calm and soften the skin. 

If that wasn't enough, there's the Mavala Anti Blemish Cream for Hands (£17.00) aimed at helping with pigmentary blemishes, which represent one of the major natural phenomena of ageing skin. 

Hormonal changes and frequent exposure to the sun are to blame. So, with the passing of time, pigmentary blemishes, more commonly called brown spots, appear on the skin. The brand say their cream tones down and prevents the appearance of pigmentary blemishes. 

Its botanical extracts (strawberry begonia and mulberry root) promise to help regulate the natural pigmentation, while an exfoliating agent and almond proteins allow a gentle peeling of dead skin overloaded with melanin, giving back radiance and suppleness.

It's hardly surprising that these new hand creams are big business.

Cosmetic surgery clinics have reported an 18 per cent increase in enquiries about anti-ageing procedures on their hands - proving how much of a concern it's becoming.

The new cosmetic surgery trend, which sees women having dermal fillers and laser resurfacing to reduce the signs of ageing, has been dubbed the banishing of 'Madonna Mitts' after popstar Madonna, 55, who has 'anti-aged' almost every part of her body but often resorts to fingerless gloves to cover her hands. 

Dr Dennis Wolf, Joint Medical Director and fat transfer specialist at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'It is common for women, as they grow older, to lose weight in their hands, which means that veins and wrinkles can become more evident. Prolonged exposure to the sun will also speed up the ageing process.

'And while treatments like laser resurfacing to target the signs of ageing, or traditional fillers to make the hands appear fuller and healthier, can offer effective results, these can really only ever offer a temporary solution.

'A more long terms solution is fat transfer – a technique which is fast becoming one of the most popular for hand rejuvenation purposes. The procedure uses advanced technology to produce a pure and effective fat graft, which means that fat can safely be taken from one area of the patient’s body, such as their thighs or stomach, and injected into the hands.

'The fact that the procedure is minimally invasive is also an important factor. Many patients have careers which do not allow for them to be away from work for long periods of time. Fat transfer is a walk-in, walk-out procedure and one which is performed under local anaesthetic, so patients can undergo treatment without too much disruption to their lives.

'Over time I expect to see procedures such as this continue to grow in popularity, as women decide to invest further in different aspects of their appearance, later into life.' 

Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD at 111 Harley Street said: 'One piece of advice I always give my patients is that skincare should not stop at the jawline. This new category of products show that an increasing number of women, who perhaps have a regimented facial regime, are now taking steps to ensure that their hands don’t give away tell-tale signs of age.

'Hands are exposed to the sun and environmental aggressors on a daily basis, and often age must faster than the face. 

'There is very little fat on the backs of the hands, so when even a small amount of collagen or elastin fibres begins to break down the dermis thins, causing veins to become more prominent, and the skin wrinkles. Women who have conquered the unlined look above the face, still neglect their hands, and once that damage has been done, often non surgical treatments are the only options to restore volume in the skin.

'Filler is the most popular option, dubbed the ‘hand lift’ by my patients, and most of those who have this treatment are in their 40’s. I always prefer to use a patient's fat, which means that there is very risk of causing an allergic reaction. This treatment, although a little more expensive than regular filler, is permanent. The results are unrivalled as the stem cells in the fat give the hands plumpness in addition to radiance.

'For those concerned about age spots and pigmentation, injectables are not going to improve the hands condition. A laser resurfacing treatment like Fraxel can penetrate the top layer of skin, destroying brown spots and stimulating collagen production so that the skin looks smooth and even. It can be uncomfortable; hands can be red and swollen for a few days following treatment but the pigmentation and brown spots will flake off in about a week – with permanent results.'
