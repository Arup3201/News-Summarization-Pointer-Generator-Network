Oliver Sherwood believes the confidence instilled in Many Clouds when winning the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in November has made his gelding a genuine Cheltenham Gold Cup contender.

The Lambourn trainer’s assertion will be tested at the track on Saturday when the Trevor Hemmings-owned eight-year-old lines up in the Betbright Cup Chase against a line-up which includes last month’s King George VI Chase runner-up Dynaste plus solid marker The Giant Bolster, winner of the race 12 months ago and placed in the last three Gold Cups.

Victory for Many Clouds would carry Sherwood to the brink of a notable landmark. He needs only two more successes to reach 1,000 career wins.

But he would probably swap plenty of them to get his hands on the most prestigious prize in steeplechasing.

Sherwood said: ‘My instinct is he is good enough. He used to make the odd jumping mistake as a novice but he is confident now. His schooling has been electric. His work is more confident. He is cocky – he thinks he is King Kong.

‘The proof of the pudding is on the racecourse but my gut feeling is that he has improved again.

‘Confidence is a huge thing in horses as well as humans. He knew he won the Hennessy. I am a huge believer in building a horse up gradually. You can aim too high too quickly and ruin a horse’s confidence. Going slowly can pay dividends.’

That policy has paid off for Sherwood with a gelding, who only cost £4,500 (6,000 euros).

He ran in the 2012 Festival Bumper won by Champagne Fever, finishing ninth but on the heels of reigning Champion Hurdler Jezki and his big British rival for that crown, The New One.

Sherwood steered Many Clouds away from the Cheltenham Festival the following season before a return last March ended when he and regular jockey Leighton Aspell were brought down in the RSA Chase won by O’Faolains Boy.

However, this particular cloud had a definite silver lining.

Sherwood said: ‘The winner had beaten him Many Clouds in the Reynoldstown Chase but we were giving him 4lb so we had to be knocking on the door.

‘I was gutted but then a week later I thought it might be a blessing in disguise because had he won or been second he would not have been weighted to win a Hennessy.’

If confidence is sky-high in the star of Sherwood’s Rhonehurst Stables, from where Reg Hobbs trained Battleship to win the 1938 Grand National, it is also back coursing through the veins of a trainer relishing being back on the big Saturday stage.

When he started training in 1984, the Chelsea supporter who had been a champion amateur in the 1978/80 season and served an apprenticeship with legendary Fred Winter, Arthur Moore and Gavin Pritchard-Gordon, was regarded as champion trainer material.

A seamless flow of headline winners with horses like Berude Not To, Coulton, Lord Of The River, Young Pokey, Young Snugfit and Large Action, a 15-time winner who was second to Alderbrook in the 1995 Champion Hurdle.

But the City crash hit him hard, horses numbers fell and he tumbled down the fashion scale.

His last Grade One win came via Cenkos in 2000 before being switched by owner Andy Stewart to the Paul Nicholls stable and the last of Sherwood’s six Festival winners came 20 years ago when Jamie Osborne-ridden Coulton won the Cathcart Chase.

He was even forced to sell Rhonehurst before leasing it back.

That back story was why Many Cloud’s Hennessy win was welcomed with emotional scenes in the Newbury winner’s enclosure.

Sherwood said: ‘It was tough. I would never have walked away because I can’t do anything else. But I got down big time. My wife Tarnya was a huge positive. I did lose confidence and doubted myself big time.

‘When I started training it was boom time. You didn’t have to sell yourself. I was having had that success it was tough and was spoilt.

‘In racing success breeds success but I am the world’s worse at selling myself. I hate rejection. It is like chatting up a girl who is not interested.’

It is hard not to be interested now. Many Clouds, who will have a Grand National entry as a back-up to his potential Gold Cup bid, would be only a second Gold Cup runner for his trainer.

The first was 1990 Hennessy winner Arctic Call, who was pulled up behind Garrison Savannah.

Sherwood said: ‘Many Clouds is a better horse than him. It is a very open race this year. (Favourite) Silviniaco Conti has to prove himself around Cheltenham and the Irish haven’t got a stand out contender. Many Clouds has improved every chase he has run.’
