Reid Wiseman is just a few days into a six month trip aboard the International Space Station and, despite the natural complications with adjusting to zero gravity, his smile has not wavered.

That's because, at 38, it's the NASA astronaut's first time blasting through the earth's atmosphere and having an out-of-this-world experience. 

The Maryland native and father-of-two has become something of a Twitter celebrity since taking off on the Russuan rocket Soyuz from Kazakhstan on May 28, with his followers jumping from 16,000 to 37,000 thanks to a series of enthusiastic posts about his mission, according to The Baltimore Sun.

Wiseman has been taking fascinating photos of earth after landing on the Space Station - just six hours after launching - as well as unabashed selfies about his attempts at acclimating to life in space.

Getting the job done: NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman has not been able to contain his excitement for his first trip to space, prolifically Tweeting about the experience, such as his first go on a treadmill in zero-gravity (pictured)

The pictures and selfies posted by Reid Wiseman, such as this image of a dice he sent floating into orbit, have made him something of a Twitter celebrity

'My parents were waving in Maryland at sunrise, so I took a picture of them,' Wiseman wrote with this shot

'Trying to catch Perth (Australia) at sunset, got these clouds instead. I¿ll take it,' the astronaut attached to this Twitter image

Incredible: One of many amazing shots by Wiseman, this was posted as he was 'going to bed' on the International Space Station

'I can't stop looking outside!' Wiseman wrote upon landing at the space center

On one picture of him exercising on a treadmill, Wiseman posted: 'First run done — heels were tingling, food bouncing in stomach. Yuck!'

Working and living in zero-gravity does strange things to the body, bones and mucles weakening, fluids getting redistributed and a general feeling of disorientation.

Wiseman could not contain his excitement during a interview from Star City, Russia, where he was training for the mission.

'There are moments when the adrenaline just crushes you,' he told The Baltimore Star.

'Holy smokes, I'm getting on that rocket in 21/2 weeks, and this time next month I'll be floating on the space station going 18,000 mph.

'It's still a little bit unbelievable.'

The Soyuz craft had a flawless launch from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

Wiseman was traveling with just two other astronauts on the rocket - Russian cosmonaut Max Surayev and German Alexander Gerst, of the European Space Agency.

The International Space Station is a $100 billion research laboratory that is the project of 15 nations

The trio are joining two Russians and an American who have been at the station - a $100 billion research laboratory that is the project of 15 nations - since March.

Before takeoff, Wiseman's wife Carroll and their two daughters bid him an emotional goodbye, knowing they won't see him until November.

According to his profie on NASA's website, Wiseman graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1997 and reported to Pensacola, Florida, for flight training.

He was designated as a Naval Aviator in 1999 and transferred to Fighter Squadron 101 at the Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia.

While there he made two deployments to the Middle East, and was selected for the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School.

After graduating he was transferred to the Naval Air Station in Patuxent River, Maryland, where his earned his masters degree and worked various flight test programs.

He was deployed to South America and then back to the Naval Air Station Oceana as a fighter pilot, before being selected for astronaut training.
