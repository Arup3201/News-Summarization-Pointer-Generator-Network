A man is charged with deliberately killing a horse and injuring its rider by running into them with his pick-up truck.

Christopher Todd lashed out at the victim Chloe Sloan, 23, after she allegedly shouted at him for speeding down a road in Orlando's Volusia County, Florida, police said.

During a dispute, one of the group says she used a racial slur.

Enraged, Todd then made a U-turn and drove at the horse, Ellie Mae, sending Sloan crashing onto the hood of the truck, according to police.

'Attack': Christopher Todd (left) allegedly drove at Chloe Sloan and her horse Ellie Mae (right), killing the horse and leaving Sloan with a broken collar bone. It came after Sloan's friend shouted a racial slur, the group said

Sloan sustained a broken collar bone, and the Ellie Mae died.

Arresting Todd in nearby Seville, investigators found horse hair in the vehicle's grill.

Todd appeared in court on Monday charged with battery and animal cruelty.

In a 911 call, heard by WESH.com, one of the group exclaimed: 'I'm over by blue springs by French Landing and someone purposely just hit us on the horse and ran over it.

Dispute: The dispute began after Todd allegedly sped past the group at the idyllic Blue Springs near Orlando

'It's my fault because I called him a [expletive] but still you don't hit a horse with a person on it.

'[The victim] was up and walking but I know her horse is hurt and he hit the girl too. On purpose. They turned around and came at us on purpose. On purpose!'

Todd is being held on a $10,000 bond.
