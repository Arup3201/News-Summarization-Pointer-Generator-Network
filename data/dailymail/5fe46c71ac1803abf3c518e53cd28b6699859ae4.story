A former executive at the News of the World, whose emails revealed widespread phone-hacking at the now defunct paper, was jailed for eight months yesterday.

Ian Edmondson had already admitted conspiring with colleagues to illegally access voicemails and has been linked to 334 hacking cases including those of Jude Law, Sienna Miller and Paul McCartney.

Passing sentence at the Old Bailey, Judge John Saunders told the 45-year-old ex-news editor: ‘There was considerable pressure on journalists at the News of the World to obtain stories to sell newspapers - that may have led to a belief that the ends justified the means.’

Edmondson is the eighth employee of what was once Britain’s biggest-selling paper to have been convicted of involvement in hacking.

Hacking first emerged in 2006 when bosses at the paper’s parent company, News International, said it was limited to ex-royal editor Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn Mulcaire, who were both jailed.

However the discovery of emails from Mulcaire to Edmondson, by then the paper’s associate editor, led to a major new police investigation.

The emails, dating from 2006, provided instructions on how to hack the phones of the then deputy prime minister, a government minister and Frederick Windsor, the son of Queen Elizabeth's cousin. 

Edmondson, who was sacked in 2011, was a defendant in the trial that led to the jailing of his former editor Andy Coulson, who later become David Cameron’s media chief.

The trial was told Coulson had once instructed Edmondson when he was working on a story about a celebrity to "do his phone".
