Brave: Annie Edson Taylor became the first person to survive a drop over the Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1901

Before Felix Baumgartner, or even Evel Knievel, there was a daredevil with much humbler ambitions - but by no means less mettle.

Annie Edson Taylor was the first person to survive a trip over the Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1901.

And her story is all the more extraordinary because it seems she never set out to become a record-breaker.

After the death of her husband David in the American Civil War, she had lived a nomadic existing teaching on opposite coasts of the United States.

But at the age of 62, she was facing a grim financial future and possible retirement in the poorhouse.

In a bid to secure her financial future, she decided to become the first person to drop over the Niagara Falls on her 63rd birthday.

Annie believed her feat would bring her fame and fortune by selling memorabilia, group signings and giving talks.

But although her achievement made headlines around the world at the time, it didn't quite work out as planned and she lived the rest of her life in relative poverty.

The New York Times reported how thousands of people gathered at the bottom of The Horseshoe Falls to witness her attempt, despite most thinking she stood little chance of surviving.

Frank Russell, Annie's manager, had been warned he could be charged with manslaughter if she died during the attempt

The tension was even more palpable for Annie's manager Frank Russel who had been warned he could be prosecuted for manslaughter by both Canadian and American police if she died.

The custom-built barrel was around 1.4metres tall by 1m wide, made of oak and iron and padded with a mattress.

After she got in a lid was put in place and a bicycle pump used to pressurize it.

A 200lb anvil was used to weight it and it floated in an upright position through the rapids and down the 174-foot fall.

A crowd of thousands reportedly gathered to watch the attempt although most didn't believe Annie would survive

Her first words after emerging from the barrel were 'I prayed every second except when I went unconscious'

There were apparently several delays before the launch - particularly because no one wanted to be part of the potential suicide.

Much to their amazement, the crowd saw the barrel bob back to the surface after a 20-minute journey over the edge.

Many then doubted that the woman inside would still be alive.

But Annie emerged unscathed and suffering only from a degree of shock.

She told reporters how she had momentarily gone unconscious during the trip but thanked God for her survival.

According to reports, Annie's first words were: 'I prayed every second I was in the barrel except for a few seconds after the fall when I went unconscious.'

'Nobody ought ever to do that again. If it was with my dying breath, I would caution anyone against attempting the feat.

'I would sooner walk up to the mouth of a cannon, knowing it was going to blow me to pieces than make another trip over the Fall.'

Despite her achievement, Annie never achieved the wealth she desired, partly because her manager decamped with her barrel, and most of her savings were used towards private detectives hired to find it.
