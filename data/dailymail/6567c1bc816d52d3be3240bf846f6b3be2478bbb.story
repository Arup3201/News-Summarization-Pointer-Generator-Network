A gang of muggers robbed wealthy people at knifepoint after following them home from expensive restaurants, a court heard yesterday.

The masked men ripped rings, necklaces and watches worth almost £250,000 from their victims as they reached their doorsteps, the jury was told.

Among those attacked were Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of airports operator BAA, and his wife who were targeted outside their £7million mansion.

Other victims were left fearing for their lives as they were singled out by the gang who stalked London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods, Southwark Crown Court was told.

The three men cruised the streets in stolen high-end cars with false number plates looking for lone women and elderly people to rob. They netted valuables worth £242,000, including one ring worth £75,000, before selling the loot to a corrupt Hatton Garden jeweller, the jury heard.

Kenneth Millett, prosecuting, said the robberies left victims terrified.

The court was told Sir Nigel, 64, and his wife Lesley were robbed after walking home from a Chelsea restaurant in May last year. As they walked through their front door a masked man grabbed it and forced it open, making Lady Rudd fall over.

Mr Millett said: ‘She looked up and saw what she believed was a masked man standing over her who then put his knees on her chest. He then pulled her fingers on her left hand trying to get her rings off. He pushed her face and she started to scream.

‘He told her to shut up and ‘‘give him the f****** rings’’. He also removed her Cartier watch from her wrist and tried to remove her bracelet.

‘When he had difficulty he forced it, breaking the clasp. He then ripped the necklace she was wearing from her neck.’

Lady Rudd feared her husband would be killed as a second masked man held a large kitchen knife to his chest and demanded he open a safe. The safe was empty but the men still escaped with valuables worth £84,000.

The court heard the gang was also responsible for four other robberies between May and October last year.

Two women were attacked in Hampstead within days of each other after returning home from dining in Mayfair, and a third was followed home to Knightsbridge from Chelsea. The robberies netted valuables worth a total of £83,000.

The final robbery led to the gang’s arrest after they ripped a ring worth £75,000 from the finger of a woman in October. She scratched one of the men and DNA taken from her nail clippings identified one of the suspects,  the jury was told.

Gulam Gani, 47, of West London, Nicholas Lewis, 34, of Romford, Essex, and Shaun Wallace, 30, of West London, all deny conspiracy to rob.

A fourth man, Radcliffe Benjemin, 55, of Ilford, Essex, denies conspiracy to handle stolen goods.

The trial continues.
