For years, they were banished to the wardrobes of badly-dressed dads.

But believe it or not, nineties-style sports trainers are apparently making a comeback - and fashion experts are saying it won’t be long before we’re all wearing them.

Nike Air Max trainers are now being sported by a raft of celebrities, including singers Rita Ora and Lily Allen, Twilight actor Robert Pattison and even President Obama.

Retro: Fashion experts say that we will all be wearing Nike Air Max trainers again soon as sales have gone up

The shoe, which was first released in the UK 25 years ago, is enjoying a revival all over the country as part of a return of sportswear, according to retailers.

Online shopping website Asos reported a 320 per cent growth in sales of Nike Air Max since last year while high street store Schuh also reported an increase.

The shoe, which features a trademark air bubble displayed on the sole, was popularised in the nineties by musicians and sports personalities.

Fashion experts say this year’s revival was prompted by a nostalgia for the decade, which many now see as a ‘golden era’.

Star: The star has many pairs of the trainers, which are said to become the next must have footwear

David Spencer, product and marketing director at Schuh said: ‘Nineties sport is the footwear of choice and we have seen a massive uplift in sales for this type of footwear, especially on ladies - where we are seeing girls who aren’t traditionally sports customers buying into the trend too.’

Nichola Carroll, branded footwear buyer for Asos, added: ‘We have seen a 320 per cent growth on Nike Air Max trainers on the same period for the previous year, making them the casual wardrobe staple.

‘There has been an increase across all trainers.’

Nike Air Max were first introduced in 1987 after designer Tinker Hatfield hit upon the novel idea of showing the inside of the sole with a ‘bubble’.

The design was inspired by the Pompidou Centre in Paris, which has its steel structure, escalators and pipes all exposed on the outside.

The craze for Nike Air Max trainers spread far and wide - rapper Dizzee Rascal had a customised pair while basketball star LeBron James had an entire line.

At the time, they were also adopted by those on the nineties dance scene, where ravers often stayed up all night partying in fields.

Approval: Even US President Barack Obama has been spotted sporting the retro trainers

Experts say the new trend for the retro shoe is down to a new nostalgia for the era, when Britain for the most part enjoyed a flourishing economy.

Adam Saville, clubs editor for the publication DJ Mag, told The Observer that youngsters are increasingly turning to the nineties for inspiration.

He said: ‘When the future’s bleak, there’s a fetishisation of what came before. People are looking back as if it was some sort of golden age.’

Sarah Raphael, online editor for I-D magazine, added: ‘It’s the rule of the 20-year cycle.

‘The 00s relived the 80s with Dr Martens; the 10s are reliving the 90s and sportswear is back.’
