It is dressing room scenario that most women can empathize with.

Trying on a pair of jeans in your size - only to find they don't fit.

And when you are plus-sized, this is an even more frequent occurrence, according to one US writer.

To prove her point, Brooklyn-based Marie Southard Ospina, 23,  tried out 10 pairs of size 16 jeans.

Perfect fit: Brooklyn-based writer Marie Southard Ospina, 23, tried out 10 pairs of size 16 jeans. Above, she found that NYDJ PLUS Plus Stretch Slim Fit Ankle Jeans fitted perfectly, with 'soft, sufficiently stretchy' denim

She then captured photos of herself donning the jeans in New York stores, before reviewing the fit.

In some cases - such as NYDJ PLUS Plus Stretch Slim Fit Ankle Jeans and Liz Claiborne City-Fit Skinny Jeans (Plus) - the pants appeared to fit her body shape, often with flattering effects.

However, in others, Ms Ospina, Bustle.com's associate style and beauty editor, was unable to fasten the jeans at all unless 'I lie flat on my back and suck it in more than I’ve ever sucked it in before'.

These included Jones New York's plus-size jeans, Jessica Simpson's Plus Skinny Jeans range, Arizona's brand and Calvin Klein Skinny Jeans, said Ms Ospina, who owns size 14 to 20 jeans.

Tight: When trying on some jeans (including Calvin Klein's Skinny Jeans range, pictured) Ms Ospina was unable to fasten the jeans at all unless 'I lie flat on my back and suck it in more than I’ve ever sucked it in before'

'Dreaded camel toe': In reference to Old Navy's Plus Women's Skinny Jeans (pictured), the plus-size writer said: 'Digging the relaxed boyfriend style. Not digging the “digging” at the hips and the dreaded camel toe'

Meanwhile, some pairs of jeans apparently left her with a more 'pear-shaped' figure (including Forever 21's jeans), while others resulted in 'dreaded camel-toe' (such as Old Navy's  Skinny Jeans).

And in one case, the Colombian-American writer found the jeans were too baggy around the waist.

Writing about women's clothing sizes for Buzzfeed, Ms Ospina, who also conducted a plus-size Photoshop experiment in December, said: 'When you’re plus-size, things get even trickier

'Let’s forget, for a moment, that most brands and stores simply stop producing apparel after a size 12. The reality is that a curvier body has, well, more curves.

Comfortable: Ms Ospina, who also conducted a plus-size Photoshop experiment in December, found that Levi's plus-size jeans (pictured) were 'relatively comfy and soft'. But she added: 'I would prefer you in high-waist'

Too baggy: With regard to Decree's jeans range (pictured), she wrote: 'When stretched at the front, we’re looking at three unnecessary inches of space. But you’re not baggy anywhere else! The confusion never stops'

'And those curves aren’t something you can easily measure - let alone put into jeans.' 

She added that her latest experiment has proved to her - and hopefully, others - that women's 'obsession with being the "right" size' is 'nonsensical'.

'To try to define a “size” is equatable to trying to define a “color". Much more energy than it’s worth,' said the writer, who admits she is 'not a big denim lover'. 

'Sure, I had fun trying to squeeze into pants that were far too small. Because once you get into it, it is actually fun. 'But there are other things that require far more better use of head space.'
