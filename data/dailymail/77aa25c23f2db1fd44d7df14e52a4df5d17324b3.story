Pinned under a car with the weight of the engine on his shoulders, it’s remarkable enough that he’s managing to smile.

More remarkable still, however, is the fact that Justin Futers escaped this perilous situation unscathed, save for a few cuts and bruises.

The 47-year-old cyclist was dragged beneath the blue Chevrolet as he pulled out of a junction in Worthing, West Sussex.

Trapped: Justin Futers, 47, was stuck under this car for 30 minutes after it ran him down on the road

Accident scene: Mr Futers can be seen under the front wheels of the car, while his mangled bike lies nearby

He came within millimetres of being 
crushed by the front wheels and was trapped for half an hour before 
emergency services finally freed him.

Mr
 Futers, a painter and decorator, from Littlehampton, West Sussex, said:
 ‘My head and my face were scraping the tarmac so it was pretty close.

'I
 didn’t shut my eyes and think, “this is it”, although it could have 
been.’

'The weight of the engine was right over my shoulders, there was a quarter of an inch between me and the rest of the car, it was that tight.'

Mr Futers hopes these shocking images of his ordeal will be a warning to all road users to take extra care.

A former paramedic trainer, an ex-firefighter and an off-duty police officer were all among passers-by who came to his aid.

Emergency services arrived a short while later and took control of the rescue operation.

Mr
 Futers, from Littlehampton, West Sussex, was released and taken to 
Worthing Hospital where he learned he had escaped with no broken bones.

Rescue operation: Firemen were able to remove Mr Futers from under the car, and discovered he was remarkably uninjured

Recovery: After being rescued from under the car, Mr Futers went to hospital and was told he had not broken any bones

He says he has not fully considered the psychological impact of the crash but vows to be back on his bike within a month.

He said: 'I can't remember what I was thinking at the time other than "There is a car on top of me".'

Witness Mike Brampton, 53, who took the photos, said: 'It is a miracle the cyclist survived let alone escaped with no broken bones.

'As I approached the car all I could see underneath was a figure dressed in red, and I feared the worst.

'I was relieved that he could speak. It could have been a horrific accident, fortunately Justin got off incredibly lightly.'

A South East Coast Ambulance Service said they were called at 12.53pm on Saturday and sent two ambulances to the scene.

A man in his 40s was taken to Worthing Hospital while the driver, a 76-year-old local man, was checked over at the scene but did not require hospital treatment.
