Eric Pickles has accused ‘gullible’ BBC journalists of working with Labour to maximise the ‘political damage’ over the Coalition’s spending cuts.

In one of the most outspoken attacks on the Corporation by a senior minister, he said regional programmes gave ‘unquestioning’ airtime to Labour councils complaining about cuts.

The Communities Secretary praised councils that had ‘risen to the challenge, managed change, protected the best of the public service ethos’ in a speech to the New Local Government Network in London.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles stepped up his criticism of the Corporation, claiming reporters were 'unquestioning' in reporting attacks on council spending reductions

However, he added: ‘A number of 
Labour councils have given way to temptation of reliving the past in an 
80s tribute band, maximising the cuts to the most political damaging.

'With a backing group of gullible and unquestioning BBC regional reporting, this has led to a heady mix.’

Mr Pickles has long been angry at the 
way funding cuts to town halls have been reported by the BBC.

On Monday,
he said: ‘You would think, listening to the BBC, that sensible savings 
and improved services were a bad thing.’

In his speech yesterday, he said that funding cuts would have been made regardless of who won the election in 2010.

‘There is a reasonable case that 
because local government was not considered to be a priority service by 
Labour that councils may have borne an even greater share,’ he said.

He said the coalition had devolved 
spending, responsibility and powers to councils and accused Labour of 
adopting the ‘Miss Havisham approach’, after the jilted bride in Great 
Expectations.

He said opponents were ‘refusing to 
change from a faded wedding dress, waiting for the return of a groom who
is not coming back and who realised you were mad decades ago, feasting 
on former glories, reciting the taxing mantra, dreaming of taking, not 
making. Fooling yourself into thinking you can really have power without
responsibility.’

BBC news reporters were accused by the minister of being 'gullible' in accepting Labour criticism of spending cuts

Mr Pickles also urged councils to open
to public scrutiny more of its books, spending, meetings and data.

He 
claimed  there was a ‘secret state in our country’ because too many 
unelected quangos refused to publish such information.

He attacked ‘a regime of local quangos
who help set council tax, but have minimum presence or public profile’,
singling out internal drainage boards, integrated transport 
authorities, crematorium boards and waste disposal authorities.

‘I want to open up this secret state 
and ensure their council tax setting is accountable directly to the 
people, and their policy decisions are open and transparent,’ he said.

He said council tax in Manchester was being forced up by a ‘botched PFI deal’ signed by the unelected waste authority.

‘A shoddy deal by a shadowy unelected 
body, with no one taking responsibility and local taxpayers left with 
service cuts and higher taxes,’ he said. ‘That isn’t local democracy – 
it’s municipal autocracy.’

Last night, a BBC spokesman said: ‘We 
are confident that BBC local and regional coverage of local government 
is impartial, fair and balanced.’
