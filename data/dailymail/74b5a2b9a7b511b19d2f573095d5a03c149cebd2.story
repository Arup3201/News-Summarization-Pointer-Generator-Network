A 25-year-old nurse who dated Sanford Rubenstein is claiming the 70-year-old New York civil rights attorney begged her to stage an orgy - just a month after he was cleared of rape allegations.

Laura Abraham told the New York Post that when she tried to break up with the multimillionaire lawyer, he suggested that she should round up several male friends and have an orgy.

She claims the attorney said he wanted to watch her have sex with multiple men at once.

'He wanted me to be a live porno star in front of him. ...I told him that’s not something I ever fantasized about,' she told the newspaper. 

Sanford Rubenstein, a prominent civil rights attorney who works with Rev. Al Sharpton, was accused of rape in October, but later cleared

She also claims that Rubenstein tried to give her money to buy drugs for her to take - but she refused. 

Abraham says her romance with Rubenstein was unfolding as he was defending himself against accusations he had raped an unconscious Macy's executive after taking her home from his pal Rev. Al Sharpton's birthday party in October.

Rubenstein, who won tens of millions of dollars pursuing police brutality lawsuits with the help of Sharpton, was cleared in January after investigators concluded there was not enough evidence to charge him.

Rubenstein vehemently denied the rape allegations and said the sex was consensual.

Abraham says she met Rubenstein in November and finally ended things last week. She says they occasionally shared a bed - but that she never had sex with him.  

Through his attorney Ben Brafman, Rubenstein confirmed to the Post that he had a 'brief personal relationship' with Abraham. 

However, he called Abraham's allegations 'ridiculous' and 'patently false.' Brafman referred to Abraham as a 'scorned woman.'

Rubenstein and Abraham were pictured together at a hotel in South Beach in Miami at the end of February. 

She says that she never was sexually attracted to him - but that she met him once a week for dinner or to hang out at his Manhattan apartment. 

She says his indecent proposal came around Valentine's Day when she tried to end things. 

'He said, "It’s OK if you don’t want to be exclusive anymore, because I would love to see you have sex with multiple men at the same time..."' she told the Post.

Despite turning him down, Abraham continued to see the wealthy septuagenarian lawyer.

She claims the final straw came when he encouraged her to do molly - the potent powdered form of the party drug MDMA - and tried to give her cash so she could buy it. 

She claims he wanted her to get high so he could 'have his way' with her.
