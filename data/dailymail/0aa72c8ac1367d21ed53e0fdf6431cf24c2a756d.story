The Queen will sign a new charter today backing equal rights for women and gay people in every Commonwealth nation in her first official public appearance since leaving hospital.

In a special ceremony to mark Commonwealth Day, she will endorse the document which includes the core values - from human rights to the rule of law - that leaders have committed to upholding.

The Commonwealth Charter declares: 'We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds.'

The words 'other grounds' are being seen as including sexuality.

However there was criticism from some human rights campaigners who said the charter appeared not to include any specific commitment to equality for gay people.

The Queen is expected to sign the agreement at London's Marlborough House, the Pall Mall headquarters of the Commonwealth Secretariat.

In a pre-recorded speech to be broadcast today, the monarch will say the values of the new charter have 'special emphasis' on including everyone in striving for a better future.

She will say: 'Ambition and curiosity open new avenues of opportunity.

'That is what lies at the heart of our Commonwealth approach: individuals and communities finding ways to strive together to create a better future that is beneficial for all.'

The Commonwealth Day ceremony will be the Queen's first public appearance since leaving the King Edward VII hospital last week

She will add: 'Our shared values of peace, democracy, development, justice and human rights - which are found in our new Commonwealth Charter - mean that we place special emphasis on including everyone in this goal, especially those who are vulnerable.

Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said the charter was 'a step forward' but claimed much more needed to be done to protect gay rights in Commonwealth countries.

He said: 'It is an important document but it does not include any explicit commitment to gay rights.

'The Commonwealth Charter is a step forward for human rights in the member states but there's still much more to be done in terms of gay rights.

'Forty-one out of 54 Commonwealth states still criminalise homosexuality.

'There appears to be a clause in the charter to prohibit discrimination on 'other grounds' - this could be interpreted to cover homophobic discrimination but it will be down to the discretion of individual commonwealth countries.'

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'At a Commonwealth event, the Queen will sign a charter agreed upon by the 54 members of the Commonwealth.

'The Queen, as in all matters, is apolitical but is signing the document in her capacity as head of the Commonwealth.'

The charter, agreed by all Commonwealth heads of government last December, will also endorse new legislation ending discrimination against women in the line of succession to the British throne.

The Government is introducing new legislation ending discrimination against women in the line of succession to the British throne.

The measure will mean that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first baby can succeed to the throne, regardless of whether the child is a girl or a boy.

Ministers are set to introduce the new law after receiving consent from all the Commonwealth realms to push ahead with the change.

The Succession to the Crown Bill will also end the ban on anyone in the line of succession marrying a Roman Catholic.
