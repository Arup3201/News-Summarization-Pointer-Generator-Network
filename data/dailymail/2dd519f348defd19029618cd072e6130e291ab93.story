Bill Clinton flew more than ten times on the private jet of an American billionaire former friend of Prince Andrew who went on to be accused of having sex with underage girls

Bill Clinton flew more than ten times on the private jet of an American billionaire former friend of Prince Andrew who went on to be accused of having sex with underage girls.

Newly disclosed flight logs show that between 2002 and 2005 the former US President travelled around the world courtesy of Jeffrey Epstein while his wife, Hillary, was a senator in New York.

Among the stops were Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St James, where young girls were supposedly kept as sex slaves.

Clinton, who flew on the jet more than ten times, was deemed to be so close to Epstein he was nearly forced to give a statement during the investigation into the latter’s paedophilia, US legal documents also reveal.

Epstein was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for underage prostitution.

More than 40 women have come forward claiming he abused them, with most settling out of court.

The 61-year-old’s fall from being one of the most well-connected men in America caused acute embarrassment to Prince Andrew, who was at one point photographed with Virginia Roberts, one of  the girls Epstein is said to have used as a sex slave.

The Duke of York also stayed at Epstein’s home in Florida and flew with him in his private jet.

In a further embarrassing twist, it also emerged Epstein had bailed out his ex-wife the Duchess of York with £15,000 when she got into debt.

The flight logs reveal Mr Clinton’s friendship with Epstein may have been closer than previously thought. Before the billionaire’s dark secret was revealed Epstein also counted Woody Allen and several New York society figures among his friends.

The latest details are hugely embarrassing at a time when Mrs Clinton is considering a run for the Presidency in 2016. The papers and flight logs were filed as part of a complicated and acrimonious dispute between Epstein and Florida lawyer Brad Edwards and disgraced attorney Scott Rothstein, who is serving 50 years in jail for an £800million Ponzi scheme.

Clinton’s name appears dozens of times, although there is never any suggestion that he was involved in any wrongdoing.

One section includes what purports to
 be a transcript of a telephone interview which refers to him. An 
unidentified woman asks: ‘When you were present with Jeffrey Epstein and
 Bill Clinton on (Epstein’s) island, who else was there?’ Another woman 
says: ‘And there was two young girls... at about four or five different 
villas’, along with a ‘main house’.

The same woman is asked if ‘sexual orgies’ were a ‘regular occurrence on the island’ and she replies that they were.

Another phone transcript also includes references to ‘favours’ Mr Clinton owed Epstein. The lawsuit states Mr Clinton’s trips on Epstein’s plane ‘suddenly stopped’ thus ‘raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ended, perhaps because of events related to Epstein’s abuse of children’.

Before that, they were so close Epstein had email addresses for Mr Clinton and 21 numbers for him.

Mr Edwards now represents some of Epstein’s alleged victims and in the lawsuit states that he felt he had a ‘legitimate basis’ for taking Clinton’s legal statement, which ultimately did not go ahead.

The lawsuit states: ‘With regard to former President Bill Clinton, Edwards had sound legal basis for believing that (he) had relevant and discoverable information.’

Mr Clinton is already in hot water with his wife after being photographed grinning with two prostitutes whilst at a humanitarian gala earlier this month.

The National Enquirer said her opponents will ‘have a field day’ with the latest disclosures.

Miss Roberts, who claimed she was recruited at 17, has previously spoken about Mr Clinton’s visit to Little St James. She claimed he ‘must have known about Jeffrey’s girls’ but she was never ‘lent out’ to him.

Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic Party, also flew with Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
