Proceedings: Both prosecutions were brought by Attorney General Dominic Grieve (pictured)

A juror dropped from the trial of an alleged sex offender after posting on Facebook that he wanted to ‘F*** up a paedophile’ was today jailed for two months for contempt of court.

Kasim Davey, 21, of Palmers Green, north London, said there was ‘a lot of Jimmy Savile news at the time’ and he wrote the message as a result of ‘spontaneous surprise at the kind of case I was on’.

Meanwhile Joseph Beard, 29, was also jailed for two months for contempt after using the internet to research the case he was sitting on as a juror at Kingston Crown Court in Surrey. Both men must serve half of their sentences behind bars.

The men were sentenced at the High Court in central London for conduct likely to interfere with the administration of justice, after prosecutions brought by Attorney General Dominic Grieve.

Davey had posted: ‘Woooow (sic), I wasn't expecting to be in a jury deciding a paedophile's fate - I've always wanted to f*** up a paedophile and now I'm within the law!’

A judge at Wood Green Crown Court was alerted and Davey was discharged last December from the retrial of Adam Kephalas, who was later convicted of sexual activity with a child.

Beard was found to be guilty of contempt by using the internet to research the case he was on. The jury was trying two men accused of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering last year.

The trial started on October 2 but ended on November 9 when the jury was discharged after his activities came to light. He is alleged to have done research via 
Google which turned up extra information about the victims to the 
alleged fraud, and then to have told fellow jurors about it.

The defendants in the original trial, Ian Macdonald and David Downes, faced a retrial and were convicted in March. They were jailed for eight and four-and-a-half years respectively on April 18.

Beard told the court he had no intention to cause disruption to the trial process, or to investigate the case online. He said he only wanted to find out how long the trial would take as he was worried that it would drag on, affecting his job and his family life.

Last week, Davey appeared before Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen's Bench Division, and Mr Justice Sweeney at London's High Court as the Attorney General appeared in person to call for his committal to prison.

Sir John announced in the case of Davey that the court was sure he ‘did an act which created a real risk of interference with the administration of justice, and it was specifically intended by him to interfere with the administration of justice’.

The court had reached the same conclusion in the case of Beard.

In a postscript to the judgment, Sir 
John said that ‘every attempt is made to try and warn jurors not to use 
the internet or social sites for any purpose in relation to the case’.

He
added: ‘However, as is also clear, the language used is not consistent,
giving room for argument of the type advanced before us as to what a 
juror might understand was prohibited.’

Sir John said: ‘Many judges have adopted the practice not only of warning the jury in terms similar to what the judges in these two cases did, but also handing the jury a notice setting out what they must and must not do, and the penal consequences of any breach.

‘They have done this so that no juror can subsequently claim that he or she did not understand what they should not do and what the consequences might be.’

Sir John said that after Davey was 
discharged as a juror, the judge told the jury ‘in very sweeping terms 
that they should not use the internet’.

'Woooow, I wasn't expecting to be in a jury deciding a paedophile's fate - I've always wanted to f*** up a paedophile and now I'm within the law!'

Kasim Davey

He added: ‘We can quite understand why he did this, but as Lord Carlile QC (for Davey) pointed out, what he said went beyond what would be permissible under Articles 8 and 10, quite apart from imposing restrictions on jurors properly carrying out day to day tasks which cannot be easily done without use of the internet.’

The judge said the court proposed to invite the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee in consultation with the Judicial College to ‘review the terminology used in the material given to the jury’ and to consider whether to recommend that the practice of handing out a notice as well as the warning ‘should be universally followed’.

After both men were sentenced to two months’ imprisonment, the Attorney General said: ‘Jurors who use the internet to research a case undermine justice.

‘It creates a risk that the defendant will be convicted or acquitted, not on the evidence, but on unchallenged and untested material discovered by the juror.

‘Equally, the case of Kasim Davey shows that jurors must follow the directions given to them by the trial judge not to discuss the case outside the jury room, including discussions and posts on the internet.’
