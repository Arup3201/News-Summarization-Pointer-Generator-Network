Wild bison became extinct across the forests and plains of Europe 100 years ago.

But now seven bison raised in captivity in Britain are about to run free in a forest in Romania in a coordinated reintroduction project for the species.

The animals arrived at Vanatori Neamt Nature Park in Romania four days ago and will spend the next few weeks in a large enclosure to get used to their surroundings before making their bid for freedom.

The European bison, Eurasian beaver and White-tailed eagle are among the animals that have made a remarkable comeback in Europe over the past 50 years, zoologists said.

A total of 27 mammal and bird species recovered over the past 50 years thanks to legislative measures and conservation efforts, according to a report released in September 2013.

Scientists from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), BirdLife International and the European Bird Census Council (EBCC) worked with experts from across Europe to gather relevant data about the distribution and abundance of selected species.

The European bison, which is the largest herbivore in Europe, became extinct in the early 20th century due to severe hunting pressure and habitat loss.

However, a large-scale breeding and reintroduction programme based on individuals remaining in captivity has led to wild populations being re-established in areas of central and eastern Europe.

One of the creatures set to wander the forest is a female European bison born and raised at Highland Wildlife Park in Kingussie, Scotland, according to the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS).

She is called Glen Rosa and is named after the picturesque Highland glen on the Isle of Arran.

She joins six other female bison from three other British and Irish herds at the Aspinall Foundation's Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent.

‘Glen Rosa and the other bison will join an already established herd in Vanatori Neamt Nature Park, Romania, to help augment both numbers and genetic diversity within the group,' said Douglas Richardson, head of living collections for Highland Wildlife Park.

‘As the breeding programme coordinator for European bison, my main tasks are to ensure that the captive programme remains robust and that animals are made available for projects like this and as such I worked with the Aspinall Foundation to select animals from breeders of European bison within the UK and Ireland to support this reintroduction project.’

Saved from extinction: In 1927 the European bison (pictured) became extinct in the wild but a number were kept in zoos. A coordinated approach to their management was started in 1932, with the first captive-bred bison reintroduced back into the wild in 1952

Glen Rosa was born at the park on 21 July 2012 to a male called Tomek and a female named Glen Esk.

She, along with the other females born between 2010 and 2012 were selected to be part of this reintroduction due to their genetic background and to increase the number of females within Vanatori Neamt Nature Park.

Damian Aspinall of The Aspinall Foundation which led the translocation of the bison, said: 'Many people forget that extinction of species is not simply a problem in Africa and Asia. It is happening here on our doorsteps in Europe too.

'That’s why Foundation was delighted to be able to asked to use our expertise in relocating animals to lead the translocation of these bison to Romania.'

Glen Rose underwent a series of medical checks earlier in the year to ensure she was healthy before being sent to her new home.

In 1927 the European bison became extinct in the wild but a number were kept in zoos.

A coordinated approach to their management was started in 1932, with the first captive-bred bison reintroduced back into the wild in 1952.

Reintroductions continue and in 2012, the total wild population had risen to over 3,000.

The Highland Wildlife Park is currently home to 17 European bison, including 15 females and two males and all of the creatures that have been born on site are named after Scottish glens.
