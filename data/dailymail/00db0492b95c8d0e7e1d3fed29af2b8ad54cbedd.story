Fernandinho and Yaya Toure were sent off as Manchester City crashed to a damaging 2-1 loss to CSKA in the Champions League.

The pair were both dismissed in the second half as City struggled to get back into a Group E contest they were anxious to win to revive their campaign.

It’s protest time at City. Yaya Toure is fighting back against racism on Twitter and fans booed the Champions League anthem on Wednesday night after being stopped from following their team to Moscow a fortnight ago. CSKA must play home games behind closed doors because of racism but City fans were furious some Russians got in to cheer their team in a 2-2 draw. A few CSKA fans got in despite a ban and were led away by police.

The night air was thick with firework smoke, giving chilly east Manchester a feel of Dickensian London. So credit to two-goal CSKA striker Seydou Doumbia for coping so well with the conditions. Doumbia was born in the Ivory Coast’s capital Abidjan, where the average temperature in November is 30C. He was too hot for City.

Manchester City’s two-for-one ticket offer was only partially successful. They avoided a repeat of the embarrassing 10,000 empty seats for the Roma game. But hundreds were still queueing outside the stadium at kick-off time and the atmosphere once the game started was apathetic, particularly in a first half when the only serious noise after Toure’s leveller was jeers as the referee blew for half-time.

Manuel Pellegrini might have to acknowledge West Ham boss Sam Allardyce as his guru. Big Sam claimed Pellegrini needed to be more flexible to be successful in Europe. And after seeing his expensive line-up flop in the first half, the City manager took a leaf out of Allardyce’s book and replaced lightweights Stevan Jovetic and Jesus Navas at half-time for extra midfield bodies in Fernandinho and Samir Nasri. Not that it did him much good.

Substitute Fernandinho lasted just 25 minutes before he was sent off for two bookable offences
