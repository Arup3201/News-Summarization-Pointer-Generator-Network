Jon Voight says he couldn't be happier that his daughter Angelina Jolie and Brad PItt are married.

The veteran actor told Good Morning Britain that he is proud to call Brad his son-in-law during a telephone interview on Friday morning.

'I'm very happy that I can legitimately call him my son-in-law, this wonderful fellow who I love, Jon, 75, said.

In the dark: Jon Voight, pictured over the weekend in LA, did not know his daughter Angelina Jolie had married Brad Pitt in a top-secret ceremony in France on Saturday

'You know what they are very happy.The kids must have had a wonderful time at the wedding, they all had their things to do and it must have been very beautiful so I'm very happy for them.
'

He added that they are planning to see each other soon: 'She's working now with Brad, and I've got  a couple of things to do, but as soon as we can we'll get together and it's going to be exciting.'

Jon had told MailOnline that he was planning to fly to Europe to join Angelina and her new husband Brad Pitt, having only found out they were married on Thursday morning.

'I'm going to Europe to see them all this week, I've been waiting a long time for this wedding to happen, everything is cool, I'm very happy,' the Ray Donovan star said.

Angelina and Brad would soon be headed to Malta where they are filming their new movie By The Sea.

And Voight added he was up for a bit of baby sitting to allow the Pitts some alone time.

Speaking about his three-times married daughter's choice in men - she was previously married to actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton - he said: 'Well, she's been together with Brad for a while, so they must be happier than she was with the other husbands

'I really like Brad, we get to bond by playing golf together.'

The Hollywood star said he can't wait to see his grandchildren, but said he wanted to make sure that Angelina looked after her health following her double mastectomy operation.

When asked if he was upset at not being invited to the wedding on Saturday, Voight said: 'I'm not disappointed, I understand.

'The children have been bugging them for a long time to get married and the time was right.'

And in any case, the actor had to go to the Emmys on Monday night, where he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a drama for Ray Donovan.

Voight also attended the Creative Arts Emmys a week earlier, and he was joined by his son and Angelina's brother James Haven, though it's unclear if her sibling was at the wedding.

E! today reported that Brad and Angelina spent most of this week enjoying their honeymoon together, surrounded by their six children.

"The honeymoon was a few days enjoying Miraval and how much space they have now,' a source said.

'The kids went quad biking and swimming on the afternoon of the wedding and that night they all had pizza in the garden. The whole thing was very Brad and Angie. They're low key and much more about romantic gestures than they are about having a big, flashy multi-million dollar wedding.'

Despite a previously somewhat fractious relationship with Angelina, Voight said that he often got to see his grandchildren and spend time with his daughter and her family.

His comments came hours after he woke up to the news his daughter had got married on Saturday in France - and could only say 'that's nice' when confronted by Inside Edition.

Voight and the 39-year-old actress were estranged for nearly a decade but famously reconciled in 2010.

They famously fell out in 2001 after the actor told Access 
Hollywood that his daughter had 'serious mental problems' and pleaded 
with her to seek help.

An upset Jolie responded with a public statement saying she did not think it was 'healthy' for her to be around her father.

Relations had apparently already become strained after Jolie learned Voight had had an affair behind her mother's back.

Voight 
later revealed that the reconciliation occurred after he was struck by an
 emotional epiphany, leading the Oscar-winner to change his attitude 'in
 a moment'.

He
 said he now lives for his family and in 2011, he said: '‘I suddenly saw
 things differently and everything shifted. That one moment changed my 
whole life.

'It
 gave me back my daughter and my family. Being reunited with my Angie is
 very precious to me. I adore my grandchildren, they are my great love. 
It makes me so emotional and grateful.

The E! insider added that the Hollywood heavyweights will most likely 'donate some money to charity to celebrate this milestone.'

Where it happened: The wedding took place at the couple's residence, Chateau Miraval, in France over the weekend  

'It was a beautiful few days. Brad is now in England while Angelina is in Gozo preparing for shooting on the movie they're doing together.'

And aside from their recent relaxing days at home, we're told that the two won't be embarking on a special one-on-one trip to celebrate anytime son.

'They say their life has been one long honeymoon. They've always been very romantic and will keep celebrating this wonderful happy time in their lives for as long as they can.'

Jolie and Pitt arrived in Nice on Saturday for their nuptials, believed to have been held at Chateau Miraval.

Jolie reportedly walked down the aisle with her eldest sons Maddox, 13, and Pax, 10, on each arm while her daughters Zahara and Vivienne threw petals, and Shiloh and Knox served as ring bearers.

The secret wedding seems to have been a quiet affair although Brad's brother Doug Pitt, sister Julie Neal and their respective families are believed to have been there.
