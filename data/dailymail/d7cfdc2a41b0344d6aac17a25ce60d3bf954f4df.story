Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard ended speculation about his future after agreeing an 18-month deal with LA Galaxy on Wednesday.

The midfielder will move to the US in July when his contract at Anfield expires. Here's all you need to know about the MLS outfit. 

Steven Gerrard wants more silverware after sealing a move to Galaxy... but what can he expect in LA?

WHAT’S THEIR HISTORY?

The MLS was founded as part of the USA’s bid to host the 1994 World Cup and LA Galaxy were one of the 10 founding teams in its inaugural season in 1996. 

As for the name, that comes from the galaxy of stars in Hollywood and Los Angeles.

ARE THEY ANY GOOD?

They are the most decorated side in MLS history. They have won the MLS Cup — the play-off final between the eastern and western conferences — five times and are one of just two MLS sides to win the CONCACAF Champions’ Cup (now Champions League), the North and Central American equivalent of the UEFA Champions League.

WHO’S PLAYED FOR THEM?

David Beckham is their most famous player but they have not had many other stars. 

Robbie Keane is the club vice-captain while Carlo Cudicini, Juan Pablo Angel and Abel Xavier had brief stints. Landon Donovan is the most notable homegrown talent.

WHO’S THE BOSS?

Bruce Arena has been in charge since 2008 and was previously the US national team’s most successful coach, leading them to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2002. Ruud Gullit was briefly Galaxy coach in 2007-08.

WHAT’S THE GROUND LIKE?

The StubHub Center is a 27,000 all-seat stadium just south of downtown LA. The American national team often play there and it hosts the US leg of the IRB Rugby Sevens World Series. 

The site also includes a velodrome, a tennis stadium and a track and field arena.
