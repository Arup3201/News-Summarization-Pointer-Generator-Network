A mother who took her children to a controversial church in which the minister held naked rituals with followers and engaged in oral sex lost her battle to maintain custody after an appeals court upheld another judge's ruling.

The court concluded that the father was rightfully given custody of the children, according to the ruling, which was issued Wednesday.

The custody case focused on the woman's involvement in Light of the World Ministries, whose pastor, Philip Livingston, used what he called 'light therapy' to treat his congregants.

The ritual evolved to the point Livingston's female followers got naked in the back room of a small house overlooking a lake in Wauconda.

In one-on-one sessions, Livingston would get naked, insert his fingers in their private areas and told them to touch his, according to the Chicago Tribune, which in 2011 conducted an investigation into the church.

Livingston claimed in court testimony that the 'spiritual guidance' helped cure everything from drug additions to yeast infections, the paper reported. The mother in the custody case testified that she participated in the ritual.

Philip Livingston, pictured in this 2007 photo, testified in court that he repeatedly performed a naked ritual with his congregants, claiming it helped cure everything from drug addictions to yeast infections. He said it was done only with consenting adults who were members of his donor-funded Light of the World Ministries

The children's involvement in the ritual was the crux of the custody case. A former follower testified that she saw the mother and two of her female children, then aged 13 and 10, naked in Livingston's home, and that he asked her to groom one of the children for the ritual.

Livingston, the mother and others insisted only consenting adults were involved.

A criminal investigation was launched, but no charges were filed, the Tribune reported.

A Kane County judge in TK said Livingston was not believable. He gave custody of the children to the father after ruling that the evidence suggested 'knowing and reckless conduct which creates an immediate risk of physical harm' to them.

Cook County prosecutors later moved to make the children wards of the state in a process that cemented the father's custody of the children while requiring they be kept away from the church and its members.

The mother appealed, arguing the case wasn't handled fairly and that her religious freedom was violated.

The three-judge appellate panel disagreed.

'When a parent puts his/her children in a social setting with naked adults, and encourages his (or her) daughter to receive therapy from a man who sometimes, in the course of therapy, digitally penetrates the vaginas of the recipients of his therapy, the evidence sufficiently supports a finding that the parent exposed his/her children to an injurious environment,' according to the synopsis published by the First District Appellate Court.
