Wanted: Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary topped the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of alleged Nazi war criminals when he died aged 98

One of the world’s most wanted Nazi war criminals has died in hospital while awaiting to stand trial for his actions during WWII.

Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary, 98, faced charges of torture and deportation of thousands of Jews to concentration camps while working as a police commander in a Hungarian ghetto.

Hungarian Csizsik-Csatary succumbed to pneumonia in Budapest on Saturday, his lawyer said today.

Csizsik-Csatary was found guilty of whipping Jews while overseeing a detention camp in the Nazi-occupied eastern Slovak city of Kosice, then a part of Hungary, in 1944, and was sentenced to life in absentia in 1948.

He was able to flee to Canada where he claimed to be a Yugoslav national and was granted citizenship.

Csizsik-Csatary was able to live an anonymous life in Canada, and worked as an art dealer before being stripped of his citizenship in the 90s when it emerged that he had lied on his application.

Following his dispatch from Canada he lived hidden in Hungary until he was detained last July.

In 2012, The Simon Wiesenthal Center named Csizsik-Csatary their most wanted war crimes suspect.

‘Csatary was responsible for sending 15,700 people to death camps,’ Simon Wisenthal centre's director Efraim Zuroff, told the Sun last year.

‘He was known to be a sadist, he had a determination to round all Jews up and forcibly deport them to Poland.’

Several Holocaust survivors have given testimony to his brutality during the Nazi occupation of Hungary.

'I remember Csatary loudly screaming orders at Jews and I heard the terrible things he did,’ Yishayahu Schachar said in 2012.

‘I remember women digging a ditch with their hands on his orders. He was an evil man.’

Charged: Hungarian Csizsik-Csatary was due to stand trial, accused of being 'actively involved' in the torture and deportation of thousands of Jews from a ghetto in Kosice, east Slovakia

In June Hungarian prosecutors charged him with being 'actively involved in and assisted deportations' in 1944 of Jews from a ghetto in Kosice.

The former police officer 'regularly beat the interned Jews with his bare hands and whipped them with a dog-whip without any special reasons, regardless of their sex, age or health,' prosecutors said.

Csizsik-Csatary also allegedly refused to allow ventilation holes to be cut into the walls of a railcar crammed with 80 Jews being deported.

He was taken to court in Budapest but the case was recently suspended as authorities reviewed the impact of the 1948 conviction on the 2012 case.

Prosecutors were challenging the suspension of the hearing when he died.

Hungarian prosecutors accused him of regularly hitting Jewish prisoners with a dog-whip and helping arrange their deportation in Kosice, located in a part of Hungary which became Slovakian after the war.

Csizsik-Csatary denied all accusations until his death.
