Looking back at the days leading up to the fatal July 20 movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, it appears now that there were ignored warning signs that could have saved many lives.

Psychiatrist Dr Lynne Fenton who counseled shooter James Holmes reportedly tried to discuss her worries about his mental condition with University of Colorado staff and at least one campus police officer in early June.

On June 10, the once-promising graduate student dropped out of the school, and the university officials who were aware of Dr. Fenton's concerns apparently felt they could no longer do anything to follow the issue as he was no longer under their jurisdiction.

Little did they know that Holmes bought his first assault weapon just three days before leaving the school.

Concerns: Dr Lynne Fenton (left) called University of Colorado security staff about student James Holmes

Nightline reports that while Dr. Fenton- who is a member of the
campus behavior evaluation and 
threat assessment team herself- notified an unspecified number of other 
members, the entire group never convened to discuss the threat posed by 
Holmes because he had already left the university.

Said group was created to address behavioral problems as well as potential security issues involving students and was composed of faculty and staff, including campus 
police.

Fenton
could not be immediately reached for comment. Members of the university
did not immediately return telephone messages seeking comment.

The doctor has since been questioned by Colorado police as a part of the investigation into the shooting which left 12 dead and 58 injured. A lawyer was present for the meeting.

Holmes' attorneys filed a motion that revealed Holmes was seeing the psychiatrist.

The
revelation raised questions about Holmes' year of study at the 
university's medical campus and about possible motives behind the 
shooting.

An online resum√© listed schizophrenia as one of Dr Fenton's research interests.

Who knew what: University of Colorado police chief Doug Abraham answered questions at a news conference just days after the attack but the details of the chain of command have still been kept quiet

Threats: On the same day as the press conference, police were called to the school because a suspicious package was found on the campus

The
defense motion demanded that a package allegedly sent to Dr Fenton by 
Holmes, and received at the university after the shooting, be kept 
sealed because of doctor-patient confidentiality.

It also demanded information on who may have leaked information about 
its contents to some news media outlets that reported that Holmes had 
written descriptions of an attack in a notebook.

The spiral-bound pad,
which sat unopened in the campus mail room, was filled with 
gun-wielding stick figures blowing away other stick figures, a law 
enforcement source said.

Remembering the victims: He is suspected of shooting dead 12 cinema-goers and 58 more injured

Arapahoe County District Attorney Carol Chambers disputed reports that a notebook contained descriptions of an attack.

District Chief Judge William Sylvester has sealed all court orders, search warrants, affidavits and the case file.

Holmes has been 
charged with 24 counts of first-degree murder, 116 counts of criminal 
intent to commit murder and one count of illegal possession of an 
explosive device.

A hearing on the defense motion is set for August 16.
