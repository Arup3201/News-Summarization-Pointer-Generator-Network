Peter Surman was found unconscious while surfing at Kuta beach

Indonesian authorities have identified the Australian man on holiday in Bali who died after collapsing while surfing as Peter Surman.

The 56-year-old, from Adelaide, was found unconscious about 12.30pm on Friday at the Kuta Reef surfbreak after suffering a 'suspected medical episode', according to Adelaide Now.

Lifeguards on jetskis rescued Surman and he was taken to  Bali International Medical Centre for treatment by medical staff but died two hours later.

Tributes are flowing in on social media, with family, friends and the community paying their respects on Sunday.

Pauline Coulson posted: 'I am so sad at the news about Peter. My heart goes out to you, Jan, Lee and of course Louise and Peter' family. I have many many childhood memories of Peter. My love prayers + thoughts to you all.'

Amelia Raven posted: 'Thinking of you Grandfather. Love Nathan & Amelia. Xxxxx'

Shane Ince: 'Will be sadly missed and condolences to his family at this very difficult time'

Dani Mayes: 'RIP, Missing you already Pete! My thoughts are with you Louise and your family'

Karen Schoneweiss: 'RIP to a lovely man - the south coast community have lost a very caring & passionate man.' 

Denpasar water police chief Wayan Redip said Surman had been surfing when he appeared to faint or fall unconscious suddenly.

'We can't confirm where he was surfing, because he could have floated and been carried by the waves to that position from several different Kuta surfing spots,' Redip told Fairfax Media.

Police believe he may have been suffering from an already existing health condition.

'The beach lifeguard then evacuated the victim by jetski to the beach,' Redip told news.com.au.

'He was taken to BIMC (Bali International Medical Centre). But after two hours treated, his life can’t be saved.' 

The head of the Bali's lifeguard, I Made Suparka told Fairfax Media that by the time Surman was rescued, he was 'already blue, with foam coming out of his mouth and no pulse'.

'They tried to resuscitate him and he was immediately taken to the ambulance,' Suparka said.

Surman worked as a business manager with Minda, a disability support organisation in South Australia.

The organisation has posted a tribute to their official Facebook page on Sunday afternoon, saying: 'The Minda community is in shock at reports of the sudden passing of employee Peter Surman while on holiday in Bali.

'In his almost four years at Minda, Peter was a much-respected and valued member of staff in his role as a Business Manager and will be remembered by colleagues for his friendly and caring nature.

'A genuine and compassionate man, the aspirations, dignity and rights of the individuals Minda support were always at the forefront of Peter’s mind and he will be sorely missed.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Louise, and his family at this immensely difficult time.'
