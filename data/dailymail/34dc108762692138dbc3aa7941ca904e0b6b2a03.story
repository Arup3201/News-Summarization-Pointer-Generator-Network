Sainsbury’s has blamed a supermarket price war that has cut the cost of food for the first annual fall in Christmas sales in at least a decade.

The chain said shoppers put just as much food in their baskets over the festive period, however they were paying less than a year ago.

The net effect is that same store sales in the three months to January 3 were down by 1.7per cent on the same period the year before.

Sainsbury’s has blamed their fall in Christmas sales on the price war among supermarkets in the UK

The news gives some insight as to how the rise of the budget chains Aldi and Lidl have fundamentally changed food shopping, dragging mainstream rivals like Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons into a genuine price war.

Figures due to published by Tesco this morning are expected to confirm that its Christmas sales have fallen for the second year in a row, which will add to the air of crisis around the UK’s biggest supermarket.

The company has issued a series of profit warnings and lost a whole raft of senior management over claims its accounts were rigged to inflate profits, so misleading investors.

Sainsbury’s has been forced to respond to the budget store threat by announcing a series of permanent price cuts on food essentials, from bread and butter to roasting chickens, worth £150million.

It has also cancelled the building of more than 40 ‘big box’ supermarkets as consumers move away from doing one weekly big shop towards using local convenience stores more often.

Asda has also announced cuts worth £300m, while Tesco is expected to step up its price cuts in the coming weeks.

Sainsbury’s like-for-like sales for the 14 weeks to January 3 fell by 1.7%, an improvement on the 2.8% dip seen in the second quarter and a better performance than analysts expected.

It was the fourth successive quarter of decline and the first time Sainsbury’s has reported a fall over its third quarter, which includes the festive period, since 2005.

Sainsbury’s said it enjoyed a record-breaking 29.5 million customer transactions in the week before Christmas with the result shares in the company bounced up by 4per cent in early trading.

Chief executive, Mike Coupe, warned of a ‘challenging’ outlook to come as food prices continue to fall.

‘Sainsbury’s has provided a great Christmas for our customers. Food price deflation and falling fuel prices have enabled our customers to treat themselves over the festive period,’ he said.

‘The outlook for the remainder of the financial year is set to remain challenging, with food price deflation likely to continue.’

Retail expert Richard Hunter, the head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said the chain is strong in terms of having a large number of convenience stores and a popular online shopping arm. But, he said the price squeeze is bound to hit profits.

‘The intense pressure on margins shows no sign of easing,’ he said.

‘The cost conscious consumer continues to add to the discounters’ emergence and, even though the deflationary effects of food and petrol prices play into the consumers’ hands, supermarkets in general remain on alert to shave their selling prices even further,’ he said.

Shore Capital’s Clive Black said Asda’s recent price cuts looked ‘punchier’ than those offered by Sainsbury’s. He suggested Tesco and Morrisons might also have an edge because low prices are the key factor in attracting customers.

He said: Sainsbury’s could be a vulnerable player in the middle, undercut by more price and cost-aggressive retailers beneath and losing share to the growing premium retailers in the form of Marks & Spencer and Waitrose above.’
