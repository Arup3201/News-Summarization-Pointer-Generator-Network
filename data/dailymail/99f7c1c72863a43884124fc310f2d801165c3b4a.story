A cottage which was immortalised in the famous Hovis TV advert, voted Britiain's favourite all time ad, has been put up for sale.

Billed as a slice of British history, the two bedroom property sits on the brow of Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Dorset where in the ad, a young boy famously pushed his bicycle home.

The clip was filmed by a then little known Ridley Scott in 1973 and the picturesque spot is said to have barely changed since.

Barely changed: The years have been kind to Gold Hill, pictured above, which has barely changed since Ridley Scott filmed his famous ad

Britain's favourite: Gold Hill as it was in 1973 when an unknown Ridley Scott shot what would become Britain's favourite advert

The pretty property is expected to fetch around Â£200,000.

Estate agents said the home has uninterrupted views over the Blackmore Vale and a huge garden with hidden orchard.

Agents Wolley and Wallis said: 'Gold Hill is an iconic landmark made famous by the Hovis advert.

'No.7 is located at the top of this landmark providing easy access into the town and fine views from its elevated position.

Heritage: As well as being rooted in British history, the cottage also boats stunning views of the Dorset valleys.

Humble: The house may come with an illustrious past, but the interior is still that of a normal English cottage

Character: The property has not changed much since it starred in Britain's favourite advert. It comes with an original fireplace

'The garden opens into a further level area of garden offering a large space within which to cultivate vegetables or establish an area of lawn and planting scheme.

'The land then drops steeply into an orchard area that is currently difficult to access and overgrown but has potential to be restored.'

The single-storey home opens straight on to the cobbled hill through a red front door and also has an entrance hall and pretty sun room.
