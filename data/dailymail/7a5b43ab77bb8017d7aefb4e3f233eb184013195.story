When Jason Hawkes visits theme parks, the concept of height restriction takes on a whole new meaning.

That's because he's anything up to 1,000ft up in a helicopter taking stunning aerial shots of the wonderlands below.

His latest project, in Orlando, Florida, sees him snap bird's-eye views of marvels ranging from a Dr Seuss fish ride at Universal Studios and Catastrophe Canyon in Disney World to leaping killer whales at SeaWorld.

Killer whales leap into the air at SeaWorld in front of a packed audience. Hawkes said: 'I find it more interesting to shoot abstract, art-formed images of things that are natural or man-made which you don't know are there until you happen to fly over them'

... and like that, they're gone - leaving the crowd soaking wet

'It's like another world down there with the bright colours and odd shapes.'

For 22 years, he has 
specialised in photography from the air, organising all the logistics 
including helicopters, production and necessary permits.

'You can't hear much as the engine is so loud but you certainly get a feeling of why so many people choose to visit Orlando.

Seuss Landing in the Islands of Adventure at Universal Studios. Hawkes said he enjoys shooting from above because it enables him to show locations from an unfamiliar perspective, drawing out the patterns of human life invisible from ground level

'Flying over the theme parks, we were able to get down to about 400ft which was fantastic but over SeaWorld we were only allowed down to 1,000ft.

'However I was using the incredible new Nikon AF VR 80-400 mm lens which enabled me to get some great close-up shots of the whale shows.'
