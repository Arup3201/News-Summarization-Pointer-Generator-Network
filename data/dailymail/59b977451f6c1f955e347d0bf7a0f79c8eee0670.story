A council has made more than £150,000 in just two months from a yellow box junction, leaving motorists fuming.

Local motorists have accused Kingston Council of 'predatory' behaviour after it emerged that a single hatched box in Tolworth, Surrey has been responsible for fines totaling around £2,500 a day.

Another box junction in nearby Kingston town centre was almost as lucrative, raising £100,000 over the same period.

Law teacher David Mark, who was fined in October, lodged a Freedom of Information request after the council took over moving traffic enforcement from police.

The figures reveal that in October and November, motorists paid out £153,835 in fines from the highest-grossing junction in Tolworth, and £100,203 from the one in Kingston.

Mr Mark, who was handed a fine on October 16, said: 'It is very disturbing and I think it shows the council is not being proportionate.

'The word that I would use is predatory. I do really feel the council is just seeing drivers as targets.'

Each fine costs £130, but is halved to £65 if motorists pay within two weeks.

The Surrey town is in outer London and its roads are frequently gridlocked.

So town hall chiefs introduced more of the box junctions, which are reserved for moving traffic in order to stop junctions getting blocked when traffic lights change.

Nudging into the painted area is a well-known offence in the Highway Code, and is described as 'entering and stopping in a box junction when prohibited'.

Surbiton neighbourhood committee chairman, Cllr Malcolm Self, said he was 'surprised' by the high total.

'The idea is to get the roads moving,' he said. 'In my opinion it isn’t to raise revenue.

'The
dodgy lights phasing [on the worst junction, fixed last month] meant the 
traffic was tailing back. But that is not a reason why people should 
enter the box junction when the exit isn’t clear.'

The Kingston Guardian newspaper obtained the November figures after Mr Mark revealed the figures for October.

A Kingston Council spokesman said: 'We always take any mitigation submitted into account when reviewing a case.'

Drivers who believe they were fined unfairly must first appeal to the council involved, then to an independent adjudicator - but many pay up, because of the time and bureaucracy involved.

And if drivers lose an appeal at the highest level, they have to pay at the full £130 rate and sometimes even have to foot the council's costs.

Communities secretary Eric Pickles has 
launched frequent attacks on councils for employing 'over-zealous' 
traffic control measures, particularly through CCTV.

By law, money from fines must be put back into road maintenance or public transport, after being used to pay for the cost of enforcement.
