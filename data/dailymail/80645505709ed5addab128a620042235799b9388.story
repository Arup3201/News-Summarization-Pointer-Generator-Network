A collection of more than 800 pictures taken by photographers living and working ‘underground’ in the former Soviet Union will give a rare glimpse into every day life.

The private American collection, divided into 156 lots, is set to sell at auction for an estimated £891,600 as Russian photography continues to become  increasingly collectible.

The photographs, taken from 1959 to 2004, give a fascinating peek at daily life in the USSR from the photographic lenses of many artists operating beneath the radar of the Soviet government to document ordinary life in an experimental and avant-garde way.

Soviet home-photography: Artist Boris Mikhailov retouched this photo of two sailors with a toy bear in a series created from 1971-1985 which is estimated to sell for £5,000-£7,000

Estimates for individual lots range from £1,200 to £60,000, the exhibition at London auction house Sotheby’s showcases the work of blue-chip Russian and Baltic artist-photographers.

Photographers from this era worked on the very fringes of official art and culture, exhibiting their works underground in alternative spaces until the 1990s.

The curator of Contemporary Art CIS, Suad Garayeva, said: ‘This unique collection sheds light on the extraordinary and hitherto little-known photographic artwork produced in Russia during the second half of the twentieth century.

Back in the USSR: The private collection, divided into 156 lots, is estimated to sell at Sotheby's London auction house for over £891,600 and includes a photograph of Mikki, a circus chimpanzee (right), who was trained to take photographs by Vitaliy Komar and Alexander Melamid, the founders of the Moscow Conceptualist movement in the 1970s, and this photograph by Antanas Sutkus (left) which is estimated to sell for £6,000-£8,000 with another print

Russian influencer: This artwork by Boris Mikhailov is estimated to sell for £5,000-£7,000. Mikhailov has been described as one of the most important artists to have emerged from the former Soviet Union

On the fringe: Photographers from this era worked on the very fringes of official art and culture, exhibiting their works underground in alternative spaces until the 1990s, and experimented with various techniques

‘The experimental 
snapshots, combining documentation of daily life with a fine-art are 
very different to the images of the region disseminated through Soviet 
propaganda.’

Russian 
avant-garde flourished until the 1932 when Stalin’s government took 
control of the arts with a decree that allowed the Communist Party to 
control of artists’ unions. After WWII resolutions were passed formally 
denouncing Western cultural influences at the start of the Cold War. 
Several non-conformist art students were among those sent to Siberian 
prison camps.

With Stalin's death in 1953, the arts in the Soviet Union gradually became more liberalized but politics in the 1970s restricted expression and artists had to be employed by the state. By the 1980s and the collapse of the Soviet Union, galleries were opened and artists had the freedom to create work to their own tastes or that of their patrons. 

The auction
 'Changing Focus: A Collection of Russian and Eastern European 
Contemporary Photography' will be held in London on June 5.
