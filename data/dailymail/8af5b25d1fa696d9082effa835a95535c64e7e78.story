Greedy: Bob Crow, who has been accused of holding London to ransom ahead of the Olympics, has announced further industrial action

Hardline union leader Bob Crow is again threatening to disrupt the Olympics just days before they begin with industrial action on the London Underground.

The boss of the Rail Maritime and Transport union has spent the build-up to the Games striking pay deals for transport workers - threatening crippling strikes if the demands aren't met.

And although they are already set to receive hefty bonuses, Tube employees are now to stage a work-to-rule from Friday in a fresh dispute.

The RMT union, which represents thousands of
 Tube staff, said it was in dispute over implementing an Olympics pay 
deal, as well as the use of casual workers.

Thanks to the RMT, Tube drivers will 
receive up to £1,000 in bonuses, with other workers - including 
engineers and barrier staff - earning an additional £850 for working during the Games.

In October last year, tube drivers secured a 20 per cent pay hike to boost their average salary to more than £50,000 a year over the next four years - almost twice the national average wage of £26,000 a year.

Despite this, Crow has orchestrated industrial action on behalf of Underground workers several times, as he believes workers in the union are not being treated 
fairly.

In a separate dispute, the
 union announced a strike by cleaners on the Tube and Docklands 
Light Railway (DLR) from Friday morning until Sunday, the first weekend 
of the Games.

LU said the most recent action would have no impact on services.

The union said its members working as cleaners for contractors on the Tube and DLR will strike for 48 hours from Friday morning after voting for action over Olympics payments.

From Friday until further notice, all RMT members on the Tube are instructed not to work outside their job description.

RMT general secretary Mr Crow, who has been accused of holding the country to ransom over Games bonuses for workers, has claimed Tube and DLR cleaners are 'treated like dirt'.

He said: 'While the likes of Jeremy Hunt, and the rest of the Government, are sitting in the well-padded VIP seats in the Olympics Stadium as a nice little bonus, our cleaners on the Tube and DLR, who work round the clock in appalling conditions, are being treated like dirt over recognition for the extra workload they will carry from the millions of extra passenger journeys associated with the Games.

Disruptive: Tube workers went on strike in April this year, and although workers on the Underground aren't striking, Crow announced further industrial action

'Even at this late hour there is time for the cleaning companies, and Mayor Boris Johnson, who hires them, to settle this dispute which is about ensuring an inclusive Olympics where everyone shares in the benefits.

'Meanwhile, our wider London Underground membership will be taking action short of a strike in defence of the existing casualisation dispute settlement and to protect their position in light of problems with the implementation of the Olympics recognition and reward agreement.'

Howard Collins, LU’s chief operating officer, said: 'We reached agreement with all four unions at the end of May on how we can fairly reward our staff and operate services during the London 2012 Games.

'Since then we’ve been working to ensure that the Tube will have the required level of staffing to run enhanced services during the Games.

'We have written to the RMT leadership to provide the reassurance necessary that our agreement is being implemented as intended, and that all staff working in LU stations will have had full and detailed safety training to work alongside qualified supervisors and managers.

'The fact that four-fifths of those balloted chose not to vote or voted "no" to industrial action shows that we have the support of our staff.

'I know they are keen to play their part in the Games and, now that we have agreement across the board, we can all look forward to focusing on supporting a fantastic summer of sport and cultural events in London.'

Phil Hufton, asset performance director for London Underground, said the cleaners’ row was between the contractors and the staff, adding: 'We have reviewed our staffing plans and have already put contingencies in place.

'We anticipate very little impact on London Underground services as a result of this industrial action.'

RMT has also announced action short of a strike on South West Trains from Friday in a separate dispute over an Olympics bonus.
