Bryan Smith, 58, pleaded guilty to five offences of unlawfully engaging in consumer credit business, one of money laundering and one of acquiring or using criminal property, namely the proceeds of unlicensed money lending

A loan shark who lent £300,000 at interest rates of up to 255 per cent has walked free from court.

Bryan Smith, 58, claimed his customers’ normal repayments, which he charged at around 60 per cent, were far cheaper than those demanded by pay-day loan firms.

However, one woman who borrowed £300 had to repay £850 – an APR of 255 per cent.

Smith, who began lending when he worked as a TV installer, did not have a consumer credit licence – a legal requirement.

He made small loans so clients could buy white goods and other household appliances, Gloucester Crown Court heard.

When police and trading standards officers went to his home in April they found almost £24,000 in cash, three diaries and several hundred handwritten A4 sheets of paper detailing the loans.

Analysis of his bank account showed his only income appeared to be pension credits of £375 a month.

But he was paying his mortgage in cash and rarely withdrew money, said prosecutor Simon Mortimer.

‘He lived his life in the cash economy,’ said Mr Mortimer. Smith was licensed when he began money lending in 2008. However, he did not renew his licence when it expired in 2011 – but continued to lend, going on to agree loans worth £304,330.

Customers had no paperwork, making it hard for them to keep track of their debt – and easy for that debt to get out of control.

Jeremy Barton, defending, said Smith had a heart condition and simply did not get around to renewing his licence.

Mr Barton said a market-leading pay-day firm offered an annual percentage rate of 2,000 per cent, adding: ‘Another has an APR of 5,000 per cent. My client’s charges were less than what is being asked for by regulated, respectable businesses.

‘He is not a well man. He is remorseful and wishes he had given his attention to regularising his business.

Smith was sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) to 14 months in jail, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 250 hours unpaid work

‘He loaned money to people in need of it.’

Smith, of Cheltenham, admitted five offences of unlawfully engaging in consumer credit business, one of money laundering and one of acquiring or using criminal property.

Jailing him for 14 months, suspended for two years, and ordering him to do 250 hours of unpaid work, Judge William Hart said his rates were exorbitant, but not as high as well-known high street money lenders.
