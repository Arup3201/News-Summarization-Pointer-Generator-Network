Families need to pay more for food and have become 'far too used to paying too little', Masterchef judge Jay Rayner told MPs today.

The food critic and author told a parliamentary committee that food was too cheap to support British farmers.

He said: 'We pay too little. We're far too used to paying too little. And the only way we have at our disposal, I think, to secure a robust food supply is by investing in British farming and that does mean consumers pay more and look for that label.'

Masterchef judge Jay Rayner told MPs that cheap food was costing the British farming industry and that consumers needed to pay more

Mr Rayner dismissed concerns that hiking the cost of food would hit the poor. 

He told MPs on the Environment Committee: 'If we stop talking about food poverty and address the issues that are causing poverty - social exclusion, benefits changes and so forth - that are forcing people into those positions then we're dealing with the issue at hand.

'Yes, we do need to pay more for food but if you focus on a thing called food poverty then you're not going to be looking at the bigger picture involving the whole population.'

Mr Rayner, before the committee as it raised questions around food security with regards to demand, consumption and waste, said food supply should be regarded as a public utility.

He said: 'I think we have to regard food supply as a public utility, and one that's almost more serious in some regards than gas or electricity.

'If gas or electricity was off for three days we'd get by. If food supply stopped for three days we'd, to repeat Lord Cameron's great line ... we are nine meals from anarchy. So it is a rather vital thing.

'There is a small group of very large companies to whom we have given free run of the retail food market. I mean 95% of the retail food market is controlled by nine companies.

'And I strongly believe that with that market share comes a massive social responsibility. They are custodians of the food supply, and the government of the day, the state, does have a role to mediate that supply, so that we can still guarantee a reasonable food supply given the challenges that lie outside our own borders.'

Mr Rayner told MPs on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee that farmers were badly hit by cheap food

Mr Rayner dismissed concerns that hiking the cost of food would hit the poor and said growing food bank use was because of other problems in society

He added that it was time the UK started thinking 'very seriously' about introducing a form of sustainability measurement 'which forces businesses to be very clear and upfront about that sort of stuff and slapping it on the packet'.

'It has to be said I can't imagine why any food business would not do a whole lifecycle analysis of what it does. It's good business to know exactly what your footprint is.

'But we are now seeing a massive price war between the supermarkets. It may well require the involvement of government to make that sort of thing happen.

'I think you'd probably do it on a CO2 per kilo yield measure and then traffic light it.'

But he added: 'I think it's fair to say anything that requires extra work and extra compliance is resisted by the supermarkets for business reasons.'

Asked if buying locally produced food, for example at farmers markets, was simply an indulgence for the well-off or helped to secure the national food supply, Mr Rayner said: 'It has absolutely nothing to do with the national food supply. It is a cultural and aesthetic choice for the affluent middle classes. That is all it is.

'I think the most you could possibly say is that it connects you with the food supplier because people come along with wheel barrows and sell it off.'
