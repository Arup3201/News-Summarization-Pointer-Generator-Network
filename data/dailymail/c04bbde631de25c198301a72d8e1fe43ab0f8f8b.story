Mark Manning, 54, went missing from his home in Lacing West Sussex two months ago. Police have now upgraded the search into a murder investigation

A murder investigation has been launched after a former military bomb disposal expert disappeared.

Mark Manning, 54, who worked for a charity that removes landmines in some of the world's poorest countries, vanished nearly two months ago.

Police dressed in full body suits, hair nets, gloves and masks have been searching garages behind his home after upgrading their investigation.

His say his disappearance is completely out of character and he has never gone missing before.

Bald Mr Manning, from Lancing, West Sussex, is described as white, 5ft 9in, clean shaven, tanned and of stocky build with blue eyes.

Upgrading the investigation to murder, Detective Chief Inspector Mike Ashcroft, of Sussex Police said he was treating it as 'seriously' as possible.

DCI Ashcroft said: 'Although we can't categorically prove that Mark is dead at this time, we are treating this as seriously as we can.

'His sudden disappearance is completely out of character. He is close to his family but they have not heard from him at all.

'He hasn't used his mobile phone, or carried out any financial transactions, hasn't turned up for pre-arranged appointments and meetings and there has been no reported sightings of him.

'There were no signs that he was depressed or may wish to harm himself. He seems to have vanished.

'His family are desperate to know what has become of him and they are being supported by a specially trained police officer.

'We want to hear from anyone who may have seen Mark or has any information about where he maybe.'

Mr Manning worked for the Mines Advisory Group, which removes landmines and other dangers in some of the world's poorest countries.

His family last heard from him on April 19 and one relative yesterday said it was an 'extremely difficult situation'.
