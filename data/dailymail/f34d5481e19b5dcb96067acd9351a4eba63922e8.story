Pope Francis has slammed 'deviant forms of religion' following the deadly attacks by Islamist militants in France last week which left 17 people dead.

'Losing their freedom, people become enslaved, whether to the latest fads, or to power, money, or even deviant forms of religion,' he said, laying the blame on 'a culture of rejection' which leads to 'the breakdown of society and spawning violence and death.'

'We see painful evidence of this in the events reported daily in the news, not least the tragic slayings which took place in Paris a few days ago,' he said in his yearly speech to the members of the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See.

Pope Francis slammed 'deviant forms of religion' following deadly attacks by Islamist militants in France last week which left 17 people dead

'Religious fundamentalism, even before it eliminates human beings by perpetrating horrendous killings, eliminates God himself, turning him into a mere ideological pretext,' he said.

Francis also denounced the 'abominable' kidnapping and enslavement of young girls by Boko Haram militants in Nigeria and the slaughter of 'unspeakable brutality' of more than 100 children by the Taliban in Pakistan.

Referring specifically to the U.S., Francis welcomed the planned closure of the Guantanamo prison and the recent U.S.-Cuba rapprochement that he helped to facilitate.

He called for a change in attitude toward accepting refugees, noting the many unaccompanied Latin American children migrating to the U.S. are 'are all the more at risk and in need of greater care, attention and protection.'

He said he hoped 2015 would bring progress toward a new climate change agreement, saying in a brief deviation from his text that it was 'urgent.'

His comments came as France deployed 15,000 police and security forces to bolster security around 'sensitive' sites and Jewish schools in the country, in the wake of the killings.

Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said 10,000 soldiers will be called up from Tuesday to protect 'sensitive sites in the whole country from tomorrow (Tuesday) evening', given the 'scale of threats' on France.

The troop deployment would come on top of 5,000 police and security forces already mobilised Monday to protect some 717 schools and Jewish sites in the country.

Le Drian unveiled the fresh measures after an emergency meeting called by President Francois Hollande as attention turned to preventing a repeat of France's bloodiest attacks in half a century.

'This is the first time that our troops have been mobilised to such an extent on our own soil,' the defence minister said, adding that he would prefer not to list the sites which are deemed sensitive.

Le Drian said the mobilisation is going on 'thanks to a high level of reactivity of our forces and the professionalism' showed by the team.

Authorities are still hunting for possible accomplices of the three gunmen who carried out the three-day killing spree that began with a massacre of 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly.
