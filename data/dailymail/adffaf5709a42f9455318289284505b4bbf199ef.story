He has been nominated for Oscars three times before.

So Leonardo DiCaprio had no doubt been hoping and praying that it would be a case of fourth time lucky when he received a nomination for his role in The Wolf Of Wall Street.

However, it wasn't to be, and Leonardo, 39, lost out on an award once again as Matthew McConaughey was named Best Actor for Dallas Buyers Club.

While Leonardo was gracious in his defeat - almost 20 years after he was first nominated for What's Eating Gilbert Grape - hundreds of internet memes were created poking fun at the star's snub.

Twitter frenzy: Hundreds of internet memes were created poking fun at Leonardo's latest Oscar snub

Poor Leo: Several of the memes featured Leonardo in some of his previous roles including 2002 movie Catch Me If You Can

Disappointment: One meme joked Leo would've been even more disappointed that he missed out on being in an epic selfie taken at the ceremony involving Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Meryl Streep among others

Gracious loser: Leonardo congratulated Matthew McConaughey, who beat him to the award

Trending: Leo's fans were quick to jump to his defence, with #GiveLeoAnOscar quickly trending

The mocking led to #PoorLeo trending on the social networking site as people mocked the actor.

But not all of Leonardo's fans on Twitter thought his plight was funny as some took to the social networking site to defend him.

Radhika Sik tweeted: 'Always a bridesmaid, never a bride #LeonardoDiCaprioForOscar #LeonardoDiCaprio #Shouldvewonanoscar #heartbroken.'

Poking fun: Another Twitter user wrote a series of comical captions on screen grabs of the star from the Oscars broadcast

Better luck next time: The star had been nominated for Best Actor for his role in The Wolf Of Wall Street

Snubbed: Many of the memes featured photographs of the actor as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf Of Wall Street

Barnacles! One meme mocked Leonardo up as animated TV character SpongeBob SquarePants

Emotional: Several of the pictures featured the actor in tears in one of his many movies together with a picture of an Academy Award

Emotional montage: One meme captured 17 images of the star in tears in a movie complete with a picture of an Oscar

Missed out: The meme mocking led to #PoorLeo trending on the social networking site as people poked fun at the actor

First nominations: Leonardo was nominated in 1994 for What's Eating Gilbert Grape and then in 2005 for The Aviator

Not quite: In 2007 he was nominated for Blood Diamond, while this year he was up for The Wolf Of Wall Street

And MrTwitchy94 wrote: 'The Wolf of Wall Street but the Goat of the Academy. #LeonardoDiCaprio #PunzForDays #Oscars2014.'

Ashley Bernal wrote on Twitter: 'Well, Leo still doesn't have an oscar. I believe my sanity just exploded... #LeonardoDiCaprio.'

But Crystal Wilky insisted that Leonardo won't be letting the defeat get to him, writing: 'He might not have won 
an Oscar yet, but the amount of people routing (sic) for him to do so 
means so much more than the award #LeonardoDiCaprio.'

Laugh out loud: Daniel Day-Lewis, Jennifer Lawrence, Anne Hathaway and Christoph Waltz sharing a joke at last year's Academy Awards, while the writing over the image quips they were laughing at Leonardo's expense

Never the bride: One meme mocked Leonardo up as Katherine Heigl's character in 2008 movie 27 Dresses, which tells the story of a woman who has been a bridesmaid 27 times

Teary: One picture featured the Wolf Of Wall Street looking very emotional

Catch me if you can: Leonardo is mocked up as though he is stealing Jennifer's Oscar from last year after she fell over while going to collect it

Words of comfort: The Wolf Of Wall Street director Scorsese knows all about losing he was nominated six times before winning with his seventh nomination for The Departed

The hashtag #GiveLeoAnOscar also started trending shortly after his loss.

It was also a disappointing evening for Amy Adams who, like Leonardo, has received four Oscar nominations in her career so far.

She
 was also the only nominee in the Best Actress category for the 2014 
nominations to have never taken home an Academy Award in the past.Â 

Date with mum: The 39-year-old brought his mother Irmelin Indenbirken to both the Oscars and the after party

Losing out: Amy Adams also failed to win an Oscar for the fourth time, after having been nominated for American Hustle

Winners: Matthew won Best Actor, Cate Blanchett Best Actress, Lupita Nyong'o Supporting Actress and Jared Leto Supporting Actor

And despite hoping the 2014 ceremony 
might have been her night, Amy lost out on the gong to Blue Jasmine 
actress Cate Blanchett - who also beat Sandra Bullock to the prize.

Other
 surprising losers on Sunday night included Jennifer Lawrence, who had 
originally been considered a shoe-in for Best Supporting Actress for her
 role in American Hustle.

Jennifer would have made it two 
consecutive years running if she had taken home the prize - having been 
named Best Actress for Silver Linings Playbook at the 2013 ceremony.

However, Sunday night was Lupita Nyong'o's time to shine, as the stunning actress took home the award for 12 Years A Slave.

High hopes: Jennifer Lawrence was nominated in the Supporting Actress category for American Hustle, but failed to win

Last year: Jennifer was crowned Best Actress at the 2013 Awards for Silver Linings Playbook

Jared Leto was crowned Best Supporting Actor at the awards, beating Bradley Cooper, Jonah Hill, Michael Fassbender and Barkhad Abdi to the prize.

Meanwhile, Leonardo's appearance at the Oscars came as it was revealed he is the subject of a new lawsuit due to 2013 movie Out Of The Furnace, which he produced.

The film told the story of the residents of Ramapo Mountain in New Jersey, but now some of the locals are suing DiCaprio and several others involved with making the film for 'emotional distress'.

According to RadarOnline.com, the lawsuit was filed on 2nd January, with eight community members insisting the portrayal of them as 'inbred mountain folk from Jersey' was unfair.

The court documents read: 'It is extremely embarrassing to the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs and their family members are harassed and discriminated against. The children are teased at school.'
