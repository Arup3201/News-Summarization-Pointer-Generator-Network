A pair of high school students on Long Island have been suspended indefinitely after bringing a Confederate flag to school.

The two seniors at St. Anthony's High School in South Huntington came to school wearing the flag over their shoulders at an after-hours sporting event, said the school's principal, Brother Gary Cregan.

'The African-American students who immediately saw it really exercised heroic restraint and fortunately a teacher immediately confiscated the flag and took the students out of the gym,' he told CBS New York.

Two students have been permanently suspended for wearing a Confederate flag to school

While Cregan initially suspended them for 10 days he has since changed his mind to make the punishment indefinite.

Cregan wrote a letter to the unnamed student's parents saying that any symbol 'designed to revive past injustices or to inflame discrimination or racial intolerance, is completely unacceptable and profoundly offensive,' according to Newsday.

He called the flag a symbol of hate.

'I find it just very hard to even imagine why any student in 2014 would even consider or think that a Confederate flag would be anything other than a symbol of hate,' he said.

Student Jessica Flynn agreed.

'It's absolutely absurd,' she said. 'I don't understand why you would bring up things from the past that are hateful.'

The sentiment was echoed by parent JuJu Quinnonez.

Brother Gary Cregan said he considered the flag hate speech

'It represents slavery to us,' she said. 'It represents racism and prejudice to us. Believe me, I am all for freedom of speech but to have someone come in to school with that flag draped around their shoulder -- I'm not really sure what the intent was.'

Cregan said hate speech would not be protected by freedom of speech.

'I certainly think this particular symbol of hate falls in the category of something that should be excised from our culture,' he said.

As St. Anthony's is a private Catholic school it is not bound by First Amendment rights.

While the suspension was initially only set for ten days, Cregan said tensions in the school were so high it was best they not return at all

The students have not explained their intent.

However, they still have the backing of the New York Civil Liberties Union.

'Our motto is more speech, not censorship or punishment,' said NYCLU director Donna Lieberman. 'Helping children understand the impact of this patently expressive activity.'

But with tensions running high and the principal having security concerns about a return, he said they won't be coming back at all if he has his way.
