Rebel fighters in Libya have reached the centre of Muammar Gaddafi's hometown, Sirte, but there is still no sign of the North African country's ousted leader.

Anti-regime forces have managed to usurp a convention centre which had previously been used by men loyal to the 69-year-old in the northern coastal city located between the capital Tripoli and Benghazi.

The inability to take Sirte - the most important remaining stronghold of Gaddafi supporters - more than six weeks after rebels seized the capital, has stalled efforts by Libya's new leaders to set a 
time-line for elections and move forward with a transition to democracy.

Colonel Gaddafi supporters also hold the inland enclave of Bani Walid, believed to be harbouring high-level figures in the old regime.

Revolutionary forces also reported key gains in that northern city - located inland to the west of Sirte - after weeks of faltering advances that resulted in part from the challenging terrain of desert hills and steep valleys.

The transitional leadership has said it will declare liberation after Sirte's capture because that will mean it holds all of the seaports and harbours in the oil-rich Mediterranean coastal country.

Libya's de facto leader, Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, head of the governing National Transitional Council, said yesterday that anti-Gaddafi fighters have made huge gains in Sirte and Bani Walid, south-east of the capital.

'I do believe, God willing, that the liberation of these cities will happen within this week,' Abdul-Jalil said in Tripoli.

He claimed that revolutionary forces in Sirte have punched their way into the city centre in fierce fighting and are now cleaning out pockets of resistance.

In Bani Walid, advancing fighters drove Gaddafi forces out of the airport, said Abdullah Kenshil, who led failed talks for the revolutionaries in search of a peaceful surrender of the city.

'The takeover of Bani Walid is imminent,' he said. 'The fighters are only one kilometre from the heart of Bani Walid.'

He claimed that Gaddafi's son Seif al-Islam was seen on Saturday distributing cash to his loyalists in Bani Walid. 'We are 100 per cent sure that he is inside, at least until last night,' Kenshil said.

Located 250 miles (400 kilometres) south-east of Tripoli, Sirte is key to the physical unity of the nation of some six million people, since it lies roughly in the centre of the coastal plain where most Libyans live, blocking the easiest routes between east and west.

After a three-week siege from the outskirts, revolutionary forces launched an all-out assault on Sirte on Friday, pounding the city with tank shells, field cannons, rockets and heavy machine guns.

Loyalists have put up fierce resistance, and fired back with sniper rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.

On Sunday, the Ouagadougou Convention centre, an ornate complex that Gaddafi frequently used for international summits, lay in ruins.

Throughout the siege, Gaddafi fighters used the walled complex as a base and stronghold.

From there they were able to dominate surrounding neighbourhoods and assault revolutionaries trying to enter Sirte.

At the nearby Ibn Sina Hospital, scores of wounded civilians crowded the corridors, lying on gurneys and floors to protect them from the shelling and gunfire.

There was no electricity or water, and a handful of medical students and nurses were the only medical staff.

Revolutionary fighters roamed the hallways checking IDs and detained about 25 people suspected of being Gaddafi fighters or mercenaries.

'These are all Gaddafi people. They are snipers and we have captured them,' said Ahmed Rahman, a field commander, as his soldiers cuffed a suspected pro-Gaddafi sniper.

The revolutionary forces also now control the University of Sirte on the southern outskirts.

As they push forward, Gaddafi loyalists are fighting in an ever-shrinking defensive perimeter consisting only of a Gaddafi  palace complex, some residential buildings and a hotel near Green Square in the city centre.
