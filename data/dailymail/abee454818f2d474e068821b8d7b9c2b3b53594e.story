Brady, sketched at the tribunal yesterday taking notes, is not allowed a pen while in the secure hospital in Merseyside, after he used it as a potential weapon

Moors Murderer Ian Brady walked out of his mental health tribunal yesterday, complaining he had 'listened to this ad nauseam'.

But he was quickly slapped down by the judge who warned him 'we will hear the evidence.'

The child killer even suggested a panel member had fallen asleep at one point during the hearing.

The tribunal is being held because Brady wants to be judged sane and moved from maximum security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside, where he is being force fed, to a prison, where he believes he will be free to starve himself to death.

The 75-year-old complained that he had heard all the evidence before as a criminal psychologist was questioned over several hours about his mental health.

At the end of Dr Adrian Grounds's evidence, Judge Robert Atherton, chair of the three-man tribunal panel, asked if Brady wanted to say something.

Brady, wearing dark sunglasses, a dark jacket, white shirt and tie, spoke in a low, gravelly Scottish accent.

Many of his words were inaudible.

Referring to Dr Cameron Boyd, who sits on the tribunal panel, Brady said: 'It even apparently lulls him to sleep.'

Brady said he had left the tribunal 
for around two hours this morning because the lawyers and the witness 
were going over old ground.

'I've listened to this ad nauseam. I know it by heart,' Brady said.

But Judge Atherton cut him off, 
saying: 'We will hear the evidence.

'If we take the view someone is 
wasting time you can be pretty certain they will be told.'

The hearing is being held in a room inside Ashworth and relayed by video to Manchester Civil Justice Centre.

The tribunal heard evidence yesterday about his behaviour inside the hospital.

He only comes out of his room at night and shuns contact with others, partly due to his superiority complex.

But he also fears other patients and 
habitually carried a pen between his knuckles as an improvised weapon, 
until it was taken away.

As well as his "nocturnal" existence,
Brady was described as contemptuous of his peers. He shows anger that 
can erupt over minor matters and unleashes verbal tirades against staff 
and other patients, the tribunal heard.

He also targets individuals, both 
staff and patients, attempts to manipulate others, bypasses security and
bends the rules to suit himself.

He will only deal with people "high 
up" the hospital hierarchy - consistent with his narcissistic 
personality disorder, the tribunal heard.

Brady, who has been on hunger strike since 1999, claims he has faked psychotic episodes by 'acting' in the past.

The hearing was told of hospital records from January 29 this year stating how Brady has now 'almost totally isolated himself'.

Following a seizure last July, 
hospital notes recorded him saying: 'If I have to, I will never let them
see me in pain. I will act as if I have not a care in the world.'

Brady is currently 'nursed' in the hospital setting because he is regarded as being severely mentally ill.

But if he was deemed fit to be 
returned to a jail, the regime would be much less 'tolerant and 
flexible' of his behaviour and the abuse he metes out to staff and 
others, the tribunal heard.

Dr Grounds, a criminologist and 
forensic psychologist called by Brady's legal team to support his case, 
told the hearing Brady wished to have control over the manner and timing
of his death but that view did not arise out of mental illness.

Brady 
reasoned he had no prospects of release or of a better life.

He said Brady had a lifelong severe personality disorder which had not diminished at Ashworth Hospital.

However, psychotic symptoms of mental
illness he had shown in prison had reduced. He said it was possible he 
could relapse if transferred to prison but added that the prison system 
could manage his current condition.

A further review to decide if he 
needed to be returned to hospital could take place if his mental health 
deteriorated, Dr Grounds added.

Brady and partner Myra Hindley murdered five youngsters in the 1960s, burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester.

Both were jailed for life at Chester Assizes in 1966. Hindley died in jail in November 2002 at the age of 60.

Ian Brady claimed to be in communication with a reincarnated Nazi and believed he could change the laws of physics, his psychiatrist revealed.

Describing the delusions which led to his being detained at Ashworth in 1985, Dr James Collins said Brady also complained of being controlled by ‘green beings’.

At one stage, he said Brady had been exchanging letters with a woman he believed to be ‘a reincarnated Nazi’. He told a prison visitor that he could ‘walk through locked doors at night’, he added.

Dr Collins is Brady’s responsible medical officer at Ashworth but said the mass murderer had refused to engage with him for more than a decade.

He believes Brady continues to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia, recounting how the delusions escalated in the 1980s when he began adding excessive amounts of salt to his food.

He said it showed that Brady thought his food was being tampered with – a psychotic symptom.
