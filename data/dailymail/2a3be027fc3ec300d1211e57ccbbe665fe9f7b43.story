Accused: Pete Jacob Lara, 39, allegedly stole 125 gold crowns from corpses over the course of a year

A mortuary worker is accused of stealing 125 gold crowns from dead bodies he was supposed to be looking after at a California funeral home.

Pete Jacob Lara, 39, a former apprentice embalmer at the Halley-Olsen-Murphy Funeral Home in Lancaster, allegedly carried out the macabre thefts over the course of a year, between June 25, 2012 and October 28, 2013.

Prosecutors allege that he also took other items, including a cremation urn box and medallions used to decorate urn boxes worth more than $1,000.

Lara went on, prosecutors say, to sell the stolen goods at pawn shops and jewelry exchanges.

Lara is scheduled to be arraigned on Wednesday afternoon, charged with removal or possession of dental gold from human remains; grand theft by embezzlement – and one count each of possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine.

He also faces 23 counts of second-degree commercial burglary.

If convicted as charged, Lara faces a maximum sentence of 19 years in state prison.

Lara’s bail has been set at $510,000. The case remains under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Lara’s profile has been wiped from the funeral home’s website.
