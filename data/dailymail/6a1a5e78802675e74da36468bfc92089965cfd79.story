For most people, it has become a travel essential.

The temptation to scour work emails on holiday has led to more and more people looking for a digital detox

In an age where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to unplug, a third of Brits say they regret spending too much time on their mobile device while they’re on holiday.

Half of all Brits polled admit to checking work e-mails while away and four in 10 say having access to social media is 'very important' to them when they’re abroad.

One website showcasing the spots around the world free of Wi-Fi and phone reception, www.digitaldetoxholidays.com have reported a five-fold increase in customers in six months, report The Independent.

Their website slogan reads: 'Since you became increasingly addicted to your devices, we have been selecting hotels that are offering detox holidays to help you de-stress.'

‘While smartphones have their plus points while on leave from work, using them to check the weather or view maps, it seems travellers would benefit from switching off their e-mails to disconnect, restoring a little more of the all-important work/life balance.’
