Just when you thought one of the cheapest wines in Australia can't get any worse - one Australian woman has discovered a clever way to turn casked wine into sparkling 'champagne'.

With a Sodastream and a cask of wine – or goon as it's popularly known - it takes just seconds to insert some bubbles into the wine, according to a 'how-to' video published on YouTube.

The footage shows an elderly woman filling up a Sodastream bottle with goon as she tells the camera to ‘not waste money’ on expensive champagne while demonstrating how simple the technique is.

The woman, believed to be Cheryl Marshall from Perth, can be seen threading the bottle onto the machine and with a push of the button, the wine compresses into fizzy 'champagne' within seconds.

With a sodastream and a cast of wine - Cheryl Marshall turns goon into champagne within seconds

‘I think you’ve fizzed it up too much’, a young male voice is heard saying behind the camera.

‘Well there you go – Now I’ve got to wait for it to settle a bit’, the woman said as she pulls out a cleaning towel to stop the ‘overflow’.

‘That’s the overflow – don’t worry that won’t get wasted – I’ll tip it into my glass,’ the woman said.

‘Right, now I have a glass with ice in it and I’ll get one that I made previously, alright?

‘That would wait for that to settle down a little bit. You don’t want it to be exploding everywhere.’

She turns to her fridge and pulls out a bottle that she made previously and pours it over the ice cubes.

‘Now this is one that I made prior,’ she said.

‘Now just look at that – champagne – cost you about $17 dollars for a five litre cask to buy – whether it’d be red or white – ok and you can make yourself litres and litres and litres and litres of champagne [sic].’

She  fills up the bottle with wine before she threads it onto the machine and with a push - it starts compressing

She kisses her finger tips as a gesture that it is perfect and starts embracing her champagne as she sips away before saying: ‘bloody beautiful’.

‘You can put strawberries in it – whatever you want to put in it and you can even put a little bit of cordial in it but I love it as it is,' she said.

Marshall says ‘Bon appetit’ as she winks at the screen and ends the video saying: 'Catch ya later! I’ve got drinking to do.’

The video, titled ‘Soda Stream how to make champagne out of wine, This is dedicated to my gorgeous niece’s [sic]’  has received more than 55,000 views and dozens of comments.

Within seconds, the wine starts compressing and turns into champagne - she let's it 'settle for a bit'

Curly Bee said: ‘I love this lady!!! Thanks for the tip!’

While others didn’t agree with the technique, with Tom Man saying: ‘VERY VERY DANGEROUS... sorry... great idea! but the sugars in the wine will eventually stop up the pressure relief valve and your bottle will explode very forcefully’

SuperLoggis said: technically just fizzy wine and very dangerous probably best to just stick with sodas’.

A caption along the video reads: ‘make,drink,enjoy Trace, Jo and who ever else are interested in this fantastic idea. Don't drink and drive and stay alive’.
