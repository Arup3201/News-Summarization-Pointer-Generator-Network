Almost 1,500 years after his death, a rare seal has been discovered bearing a striking resemblance to religious figure St. Sabas - also known as Mar Saba.

The lead seal consists of two discs connected by string that would have been used to close letters from Mar Saba's monastery during the Crusades.

One disc reveals the figure of Mar Saba, holding a cross in his right hand, while the other side features the inscription: 'This is the seal of the Laura of the Holy Sabas,' written in Greek.

St. Sabas was an important Christian leader in the Judean desert during the Byzantine Empire, and was the founder of several monasteries.

He is best known for the construction of the Monastery of St. Sabas, known as the Great Laura, overlooking Nahal Kidron.

Archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority made the discovery in 2012 while excavating a site at Horbat Mizmil in Bayit Vegan, Jerusalem.

Up until 1948, Horbat Mizmil was an Arab village, but it is now being redeveloped.

Researchers discovered the site was abandoned at the end of the Byzantine period before being occupied again during the Crusades, and up to the 15th century Mamlux period.

The seal was found on the remains of a farm on this land, buried in a layer of earth believed to date back to the 11th and 12th century.

The lead discs would have been used to seal letters closed using wax, and researchers claim it is in 'excellent condition'.

When sealing the letter, the two discs were pressed together, creating the double-faced seal.
