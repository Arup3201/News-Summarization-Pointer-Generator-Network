Angry: Layla Daswani, 22, bought the £450 'Henry' gym bag - also owned by Harry Styles - from the Selfridges as a gift for her flatmate's 30th birthday

Selfridges refused to deliver a £450 Mulberry handbag to the £500,000 Brixton flat of one its customers because the area was 'too risky', a customer has claimed.

Layla Daswani, 22, bought the £450 
‘Henry’ gym bag - also owned by Harry Styles - from the  department
 store as a gift for her flatmate’s 30th birthday.

Miss Daswani, who works as a corporate finance consultant for an asset management company, said that she received an order confirmation on Monday for next day delivery.

But 24 hours later she was told the 
bag could not be delivered to her flat in an affluent area of Brixton, 
south London, because she didn’t 'meet validation requirements'.

Miss Daswani lives in a new multi-million pound Oval Quarters development, in a £500,000 two-bed apartment.

But in a further email, Selfridges customer services told her she lived in a 'risky postcode'.

She
 said: 'I got an email through the next day from Selfridges saying "I’m 
really sorry but you haven’t met our validation requirements".

'I
 immediately rang my bank to see if there was a fault with the money 
coming out but was told Selfridges had taken the cash without a problem 
so I called customer services.

'At
 first the guy I spoke to tried fobbing me off by telling me my CV2 
number was wrong but I work in  finance so I know they wouldn’t have 
taken the money if that was true.

'It was getting ridiculous and I kept 
arguing so the guy on the phone went to speak to a manager and came back
 ten minutes later.

'I couldn’t believe it when he told me they couldn’t deliver to my address because I live in a risky postcode.

'It’s
 absolutely ridiculous - I live in a brand new £500,000 flat in a swanky
 apartment block in highest council tax bracket in London and can afford
 to buy a Mulberry bag as a gift.

'I
 have no issue parking my brand new Audi outside my brand new flat and 
I’d happily walk around where I live with a Mulberry bag, I just can’t 
get one delivered.

'When the
 man then told me he lived in Brixton. I was like "are you having a 
laugh? This is outrageous" - they’ll employ someone from Brixton but 
won’t deliver there?'

Miss Daswani has since spoken to the 
chief operations manager at Selfridges, who she said admitted they were 
'completely in the wrong' after listening to a recording of the 
conversation.

She said: 'The
 whole thing is crazy. If I’d gone into the store they wouldn’t care 
about me buying it, so what difference does it make?

'I’d understand if it was a £400,000 necklace I was asking to get delivered to a prison but it isn’t.

'I
 moved from Brighton and didn’t know much about London so now I’m 
starting to question where I live in case it isn’t a safe area.

'It’s so annoying and now I wish I’d just gone into the store to save me from all this hassle.'

Brixton since become a favourite for young families and professionals wanting to escape the inner city to an area of London with a multicultural, suburban feel

The area has become so desirable that residential property prices increased by 25 per cent  in 2013 alone - with further increases predicted this year

Miss Daswani has since accepted an apology from Selfridges.

A spokesman for the department store said today: 'We deliver everywhere within the UK and in over 60 countries around the world from China and Australia to South Korea and Vietnam.

'When there is disparity between delivery and billing addresses or the submission of incorrect transaction details, we are unable to proceed with the order and the customer is alerted there is an issue, which was the case on this occasion.

'Although there was never a question of not being able to deliver the order to Brixton, the initial telephone communication to the customer was open to misinterpretation, for which we apologise as the intention was not to offend.

'The matter was resolved quickly and the bag was delivered Wednesday morning.'

Brixton has undoubtedly come a long way since the dark days of the Brixton riots when for three days, battle raged across the inner-city London borough of Lambeth.

The area has since become a favourite for trendy families and young professionals wanting to escape the inner city to an area of London with a multicultural suburban feel.

Ben Kaye, a senior commercial agent at London estate agent Kinleigh Folkard & Hayward said the area has become so desirable that residential 
property prices increased by 25 per cent  in 2013 alone - with further increases 
predicted this year.

He said: 'In 2001, the Borough of Lambeth had 64,682 registered voters. In 2013 this figure had risen to 284,000 which in itself speaks volumes about the changes to the area and local demographic seen over the past decade.

'Having lived in Oval, south London during this time, I’ve been lucky enough to witness the differences personally, and yet still the regeneration continues.

'Whereas in previous years Brixton was considered less desirable and more gritty than other surrounding areas, all that has changed and there is now a definite ambience and soul that surrounds and fills the entire area, making it increasingly sought after.

'Banksy deemed it worthy enough of an artwork in 2003 and more recently photographic exhibitions and other cultural displays are regulars on the high street.'
