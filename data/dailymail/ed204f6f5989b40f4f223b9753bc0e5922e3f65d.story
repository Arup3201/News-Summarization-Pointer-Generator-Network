An Indiana woman was sentenced Friday to 15 years to life in a California prison for the 2001 murder of her 2-month-old daughter in Desert Hot Springs, about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, a prosecutor’s spokesman said.

A Riverside County jury had convicted Krissy Lynn Werntz earlier this year on a charge of second-degree murder in the death of her daughter Montana.

Werntz, 34, was arrested along with Montana’s father, Jason Michael Hann, in 2002 after the infant’s body was found in a storage unit in Arkansas.

The couple had stopped making rental payments and the unit’s contents had been sold at auction.

Police caught up with the couple in Portland, Maine, and quickly learned that Montana had died in Desert Hot Springs in 2001.

Authorities later determined that Hann beat the 10-week-old girl to death before wrapping duct tape around her head and putting her body in a trash bag. The couple then drove the girl's dead body from California to Arkansas, where they left it in the storage unit.

Within days of their initial arrest, authorities had discovered another infant’s body — this time a 2-month-old boy who also was a child of the murderous couple — in a different storage unit in Arizona.

The boy’s body had been hidden there in 2000, about 18 months after he died, prosecutors said.

Police believe the baby died in Vermont and that Werntz and Hann, 39, trekked around the country with the remains in a plastic bin before renting the Arizona unit, prosecutors said this week.

'It was like some twisted, baby-killing Bonnie and Clyde,' Riverside prosecutor Lisa DiMaria said of the couple, according to the Desert Sun.

During the investigation, authorities also found the couple’s third child, a 1-month-old boy, alive but suffering from a dozen broken ribs and retinal hemorrhaging — signs of child abuse. That child was placed in foster care and ultimately adopted.

Hann was convicted of Montana’s murder in 2013 and sentenced to death earlier this year.

He was also convicted of second-degree murder in Vermont for the boy’s death and sentenced to 27 to 30 years in prison.

Defense attorneys argued that Hann's bouts with severe bipolar disorder should be considered and that he be charged with second-degree murder instead of first-degree.

Hann's lawyer, Brenda Miller, compared his cycles of rage to a swing on a playground, explaining that it goes up and down. One day, she said, his young daughter took the brunt of it.

'Just as his anxiety and his rage was reaching its peak, Montana began 
to cry, and her cries got louder and louder, and his rage just 
exploded,' Miller said.

Miller told jurors that he had been treated for the disorder several times in the past, but checked himself out of mental health facilities against the advice of doctors. He also refused to take medication to treat the disorder, she said.

Werntz was not charged in the boy’s death.
