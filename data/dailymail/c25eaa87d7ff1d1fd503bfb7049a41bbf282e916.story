US billionaire Donald Trump has bought a golf course in the west of Ireland and ditched plans for his 'world beating' course in Scotland after losing a legal challenge to an offshore wind farm project.

The tycoon objected to plans for the 11-turbine scheme in sight of his multi-million pound Aberdeenshire golf resort, as he feared it would spoil the scenic coastal views.

Instead he has turned his attention to the five star Co Clare destination - with an existing 18-hole championship golf links - which will be transformed into an unparalleled resort with the highest standards of luxury.

The already world-renowned Irish course will be renamed Trump International Golf Links, Ireland.

Speaking from New York, Mr Trump said he was switching his focus to Ireland after a Scottish judge rejected his legal action against a wind energy project in his mother's native Scotland.

He said: 'We will appeal this decision
 and in the meantime we will be focusing all of our investment and 
energy towards our new acquisition on the Atlantic Ocean in Ireland.'

In January last year, U.S. Apprentice star Mr Trump said the second 18-hole facility at Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, would be called The McLeod Course, as a tribute to his mother Mary McLeod, who was born in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis.

The Â£230m proposed wind farm will be in sight of Mr Trump's golf development on the Aberdeenshire coast

Mr Trump said: 'My mother loved Scotland and I wanted to create a lasting tribute to her.

'We have a lot of land and we are going to do our very best to make the second course as good as the first.'

On the resort's website, Mr Trump states: 'She grew up in a simple croft until she landed in Manhattan at the age of 20 and her first language was Gaelic.'
