A 23-hour flight delay left hundreds of Sydney-bound Qantas passengers sleeping on the floor of Los Angeles International Airport on Thursday night.

Passengers expecting to take off at midnight on the Boeing 747 flight QF108, were initially told that their plane had been delayed for only 14 hours.

The delay was due to a technical problem with the cooling system on-board the aircraft, while the cabin crew's working hour restrictions delayed the flight further.

Qantas flight QF108 from Los Angeles to Sydney was delayed for 23 hours, with passengers waiting 14 hours overnight at the airport before being offered hotel rooms

A spokesperson for Qantas apologised for the 'unfortunate sequence of events', saying: 'There was an issue with the onboard cooling system, which has taken some time for our engineers to repair.

'We organised a replacement aircraft, however because of the initial delay cabin crew would have exceeded their maximum hours allowed to work which meant a further delay.'

Exhausted travellers were initially told they would not be offered hotel rooms due to the lack of availability, however food and drinks were offered by the airline which eventually began transferring customers to hotel rooms after a 14 hour wait.

After requests from furious passengers, Qantas eventually offered some of their stranded customers access to their member's lounge.

Furious passengers such as Tim Bednall, took to social media to vent their frustration at the airline

Many passengers and the family members of those stranded took to social media to vent their frustration and concern for the extremely long delay.

Most vocal was Victorian man Tim Bednall, who initially tweeted: 'Stuck at LAX for over 4 hours waiting for my flight, and still no ETA as to when the plane will be fixed. Thanks #qantas!'

'#qantas claims it can't put us up in a hotel (none available), and no places open in the terminal to buy food.'

'At least #qantas brought around some doggy bags with food in it.'

Others, such as Anna-Marie Zaidi from Sydney, were concerned for elderly family members after receiving no information from the airline

The flight is still yet to depart, but is scheduled for Los Angeles local time 10:45pm on Thursday

He later tweeted: 'I'm starting to feel a bit like Tom Hanks in that movie where he's living for months in an airport terminal. Thanks #qantas!'

Others, such as Anna-Marie Zaidi  from Sydney, were concerned for elderly family members after receiving no information from the airline.

'@QantasUSA What is going on with QF108 at LAX?My elderly mother has been delayed for 12+ hours now! Why haven't they been put up in a hotel?' Ms Zaidi tweeted.

The flight is still yet to depart, but is scheduled for Los Angeles local time 10:45pm on Thursday.
