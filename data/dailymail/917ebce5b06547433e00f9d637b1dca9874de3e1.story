International celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has spoken out against the greedy scalpers who conned their way into winning tickets to dine at his Melbourne pop-up restaurant, the Fat Duck.

But while the culinary genius was disappointed with the scam, he admits he can't help but feel a little chuffed by all the attention.

Blumenthal also revealed that a Melbourne taxi ride and conversation with the driver confirmed to him that Australia is more than ready for his iconic science-inspired food.

Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal is closing his England restaurant temporarily and will instead open a temporary restaurant in Melbourne for six months from September 2015

The restaurant, The Fat Duck, will be opened at The Crown in Melbourne in Feburary 2015 for six months

'I've been completely blown away by the reaction; it's been really humbling,' Blumenthal said about his temporary move to Australia.

But he is disappointed that some people plotted to steal extra tickets.

'We worked so hard to make it fair for everyone. The matter is being dealt with; it's not over,' Blumenthal said to news.com.au. 

Blumenthal's English-based restaurant, The Fat Duck, will temporarily be relocated to Melbourne for a six month stint in 2015.

There has been incredible hype since Blumenthal announced that he had selected Melbourne, after considering Las Vegas, St Tropez, Miami and Dubai as possible sites for the relocation. 

Only 14,000 people will have the rare opportunity to enjoy his world famous cuisine.  

The 'tickets' are a hot item, with many of the people who were left out desperate to experience Blumenthal's culinary mastery. 

The British chef's signature dishes infuse science with food and he is known for his kooky creations, including lickable wallpaper a la Willy Wonka and bacon and egg ice cream. 

But the trouble all began when Australians had the opportunity to enter a ballot to win the chance to dine at the restaurant.

It appeared that more than 90,000 people tried their luck for a decadent night at the restaurant, boasting a $525-a-head price.

However, it emerged last month that scammers hired IT experts to find a way to enter the competition hundreds of times, using fake names and numbers.

It's reported that several financial professionals went to great lengths to scam the ballot system, each successfully winning around 40 of the incredibly rare restaurant reservations.

Although Crown is currently looking into their legal options, it's claimed the applicants have not broken any law so could potentially be allowed to keep their tickets.

The chef warns those responsible for the scam that investigations into the legality of their actions are ongoing. 

Blumenthal is frequently asked why he picked Australia over any other destination.

Despite the ticket controversy, Blumenthal remains thrilled with his decision to temporarily relocate to Australia.

From his experiences with Australians in his English restaurant, as well as a chance encounter with a Melbourne taxi driver, he decided that Aussies' 'laidback' demeanour is a perfect fit for his experimental approach to food. 

The taxi driver suggested 'making an extra hole in his pita bread to separate the various fillings.' Blumenthal told news.com.au.

'Imagine a London cabbie saying that! They'd say: 'You're the chef who does all that funny stuff, innit?' 

Compared to the 'rigidity' of Italian food rules, Australians are willing to explore new taste sensations, says Blumenthal.  

'In Australia, I'm seeing the biggest explosion of food of any country in the world.' 

More than 250,000 applicants were unsuccessful in their attempt to reserve a table at the 'pop-up' restaurant

However, Australians weren't particularly laid back when it came to acquiring tickets to the Melbourne pop-up restaurant.

Ads appeared on online websites such as Gumtree from desperate foodies, offering up to $1000 to buy a ticket to dine at the restaurant – in addition the restaurant's price of $525-a-head.

It's believed the scam, which involved reserving seats with a pseudonym but correct contact details, was conducted by scalpers, hoping to increase their chances of winning the tickets and to then sell them at an extortionate price.

Other wealthy professionals allegedly employed the same method simply to 'guarantee' they would win reservations.  

An IT expert in China was hired to work out a way to allow the user to enter the ballot multiple times, according to reports.

It's alleged the loophole was found because the website did not record the applicants' IP address.

The revelation comes after a hilarious fiasco when the celebrity chef tried to call the last 13 people to secure reservations to tell them about their success. 

He had very little success and he and the people around him have been filmed in hysterics as the well-intentioned phone calls went from bad to worse. 

The tenth person Mr Blumenthal called was the first to finally show a positive reaction. 

The first nine callers either hung up, did not answer, did not believe him or were just unimpressed with the offer. 

The first man the chef rang sounded entirely apathetic about the whole experience, explaining that he was not fussed and that his girlfriend has 'already won tickets anyway'.

One man was dubious and had a colourful response to the phone call.

'You're sh***ing me, aren't you?' he exclaims.

'I'm not sh***ing you at all, it's me, really,' a bemused Mr Blumenthal responds.  

Some who were knocked back were trying to negotiate their way onto others' tables

Meanwhile Diana Forward said she was 'so bummed' to miss out on a table

Those who were not lucky enough to get a place have expressed their bitter disappointment on Twitter but not without a sense of humour

'Missed out in the ballot for a reservation at #fatduckmelbourne,' James Caldwell tweeted

Fans of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal took to social media to express their devastation at missing out on a table.

Those who were not lucky enough to get a place have expressed their bitter disappointment on Twitter but not without a sense of humour.

'#fatduckmelbourne ballots are out, sadly I did not get a reservation #sadduck. Guess Ill [sic] get $500 of #maccas [McDonald's] instead,' Julian Ridden tweeted.

While Roslyn Grundy said: 'But Heston, I thought we were buddies?'

Some who were knocked back were trying to negotiate their way onto others' tables. 

Twitter user Candice offered up a friend as payment.

'Will trade @Dame_1978 for a table at the #fatduckmelbourne - No luck in the ballot & this looks too good to miss out,' she wrote.

But della wilson was more conventional in her method of compensation.

'Willing to pay if anyone has a fat duck reservation for Melbourne #fatduckmelbourne #gutted #alreadybeentodinnerbyheston,' she said.

Unsuccessful applicants who have been placed on the waiting list, only at their request, may still have a chance if there are any cancellations. 

Earlier this year, Fat Duck was named the third best restaurant in the world in an annual poll run by private jet lifestyle magazine Elite Traveler and Champagne Laurent-Perrier.

His London eatery, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal also placed 23rd in the top 100 eateries in the world list.
