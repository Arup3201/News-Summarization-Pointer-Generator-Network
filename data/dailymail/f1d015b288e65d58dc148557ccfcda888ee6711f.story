Google is considering buying Israeli satnav startup Waze - putting it in a billion dollar bidding war with Facebook for the firm.

Waze is seeking more than $1 billion and is fielding expressions of interest from multiple parties, Bloomberg claims.

Maps and navigation services have become a key asset for technology companies as consumers increasingly adopt smartphones and other mobile devices.

Waze uses satellite signals from members' smartphones to 'crowdsource' maps and traffic data, and can run on Apple or Android handsets and tablets

Other media have reported that Facebook Inc has held talks to buy Waze for as much as $1 billion
Google and other parties approached Waze after the Facebook talks became
 public but none of the bidders are close to clinching a deal, Bloomberg
 said, adding that the start-up might decide to remain independent.

Apple is not part of the discussions, Bloomberg said.

Previous rumours had claimed theat Apple was set to buy the firm to bolster its troubled Maps app.

Waze could not immediately be reached for comment.

Pondering a purchase: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is believed to have offered $1bn to buy satnav firm Waze

The Waze software shows other users nearby as it guides users, who can also report problems which are shared with all users

Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Waze uses satellite signals from 
members' smartphones to generate maps and traffic data, which it then 
shares with other users, offering real-time traffic information.

The four-year-old company has 47 
million users. It has raised $67 million in funding from firms including
 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Blue Run Ventures and 
semiconductor company Qualcomm Inc.

Waze has 11 of its 100 employees based in the United States, with the remaining staff in Israel.

It has already partnered with Facebook  in October 2012 when Waze released its updated version that allows users to share their drive with their Facebook friends.

If it goes ahead, the deal  would be Facebook's third acquisition in Israel.

It bought photo sharing app Snaptu in 2011 for $70 million and facial recognition firm  Face.com in 2012 for $60 million.
