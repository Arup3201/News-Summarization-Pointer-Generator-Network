Plastic bags are seen as the scourge of the landscape, threatening the lives of wildlife and marine creatures around the world.

Yet urban bees in Canada have found a novel use for the litter.

Research from the University of Guelph has revealed some urban bees have resorted to using small pieces of plastic bags and plastic building materials to construct their nests.

The plastic is used as a substitute for plant resins and researchers claim it highlights the 'bees' resourcefulness and flexibility in adapting to a human-dominated world.'

Researchers from Canada found two species of urban leafcutter bees, pictured, have started using small pieces of plastic as a substitute for plant resins in their nests. In both cases, larvae successfully developed and were free from parasites. The study claims this means the plastic could be making the nests more secure

‘Plastic waste pervades the global landscape,’ said lead author Scott MacIvor, a doctoral student at York University and a Guelph graduate.

‘Although researchers have shown adverse impacts of the material on species and the ecosystem, few scientists have observed insects adapting to a plastic-rich environment.’

The flight of the bumblebee may seem clumsy and slow, but new research claims these humble insects can reach altitudes higher than the peak of Mount Everest.

Despite their rotund bodies and relatively small wings, researchers from Wyoming found that bees can negotiate air so thin it would kill a human - making them the finest flyers in the insect world.

In a series of experiments, scientists placed wild bees in a flight chamber and while all managed to fly at heights of 7,500m (24,606ft), two exceed heights of 9,000m (29,528ft).

MacIvor, along with Professor Andrew Moore, supervisor of analytical microscopy at Laboratory Services, made the discovery while examining nest boxes in Toronto.

They found two solitary bee species using plastic in place of natural nest building materials.

The first bee, Megachile campanulae, traditionally uses plant resins to build its nests, yet MacIvor found evidence of a grey ‘goo’ in the bees’ boxes, which he initially believed to be chewing gum.

Moore used a scanning electron microscope to take highly detailed pictures of the item, as well as x-ray microanalysis to determine the elements in the sample and infrared microscopy to identify polymers.

He discovered that the M. campanulae was occasionally replacing plant resins with polyurethane-based exterior building sealant, such as caulking, in its brood cells, created in a nest to rear larva.

The researchers also discovered another kind of bee, Megachile rotundata, an alfalfa leafcutter, was using pieces of polyethylene-based plastic bags to construct its brood cells.The glossy plastic replaced almost a quarter of the cut leaves normally used to build each cell.

Markings showed that the bees chewed the plastic differently than they did leaves, suggesting that the insects had not collected the plastic by mistake. Nor were was there a shortage of leaves for the bees in the study.

‘The plastic materials had been gathered by the bees, and then worked - chewed up and spat out like gum - to form something new that they could use,’ Moore said.

In both cases, larvae successfully developed from the plastic-lined nests. In fact, the bees emerged parasite-free, suggesting plastic nests may physically impede parasites, according to the study.

The nests containing plastic were among more than 200 artificial nest boxes monitored by MacIvor as part of a large-scale investigation of the ecology of urban bees and wasps, a project involving numerous citizen scientists.

‘The novel use of plastics in the nests of bees could reflect the ecologically adaptive traits necessary for survival in an increasingly human-dominated environment,’ MacIvor said.

The research was published recently in the journal Ecosphere.
