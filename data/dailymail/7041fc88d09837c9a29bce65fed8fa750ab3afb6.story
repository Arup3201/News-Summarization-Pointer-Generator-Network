Former pupils of a paeodphile teacher who allegedly abused up to 60 boys at a leading private school spoke last night of their shock at learning of his depraved lifestyle.

William Vahey, 64, is said to have held a
 ‘cookie race’ at bedtime in which children as young as ten were 
encouraged to eat as many as they could, unaware they had been drugged. 
Once the pupils passed out, some were assaulted.

Details of the calculating schemes of the predator emerged as the extent of his offending became clear yesterday.

Vahey, pictured with his wife Jean, killed himself at a US motel last month as FBI agents were poised to investigate a USB memory stick containing dozens of graphic images of naked children dating back to 2008

The revelations prompted 'complete shock' in Natalie Salmon, 23, who was at a school where the paedophile teacher worked in Venezuela.

She said: 'It’s so sad, and it’s the first time where I’ve thought to myself as a girl I am safer than being a boy.’

She said she remembered Vahey as being a 'nice, shy sort of guy', but that her male friends from school now refuse to even speak about the possibility they were his victims.

FBI investigators said more than 100 potential victims had come forward since news broke yesterday that the married American had taken pictures of himself attacking up to 60 sleeping students from the elite Southbank International School in Westminster during class trips abroad between 2009 and 2013.

The sickening images depicted children aged ten to 14 at the international school, where he taught history and geography and led trips to Jordan, Nepal and Venezuela.

Another 30 children, who also appeared to be unconscious or asleep when the assaults took place, were pictured from other schools he worked in during a 40-year career spent teaching at ten American international schools in nine countries.

Southbank International School, which is favoured by diplomats and foreign executives, has 758 pupils and charges fees of £25,000 a year.

Vahey committed suicide at a motel in the US last month as the FBI were poised to investigate a USB memory stick containing the graphic images of naked children dating back to 2008.

The father of two plunged a knife into his chest two days after confessing that he had abused boys throughout his life using sleeping pills.

Police later removed items from his £1.8million apartment in Maida Vale, west London, where he is alleged to have kept large amounts of sleeping pills.

Miss Salmon, now a broadcast journalism student in London, was 11 when she enrolled at the elite English-language international school Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas where her father was working for oil giant Halliburton.

She told Sky News the revelations about the popular American history and geography teacher had come as a ‘complete shock’.

It has been claimed Vahey would sprinkle crushed sedatives into Oreo cookies and feed them to his pupils

A former student taught by Vahey at the Jakarta International School in Indonesia in the 1990s, who did not want to be named, told the Mail she could not reconcile the ‘great teacher’ with the predatory monster now revealed.

Yesterday a British mother of two, whose teenage sons went on several school trips with Vahey, said he used to hand out Oreo cookies and tell pupils that they could be the lead character in his bedtime story if they won the cookie race.

The mother, who did not wish to be identified, said he ‘groomed’ pupils and parents: ‘The boys would sit around and were handed Oreos. He would tell them to go and he would drop his hand to start the race.

‘Then the first one who had the Oreo, the higher up they would be in the story and so on. He would have been able to split the Oreos apart, ground up the stuff and sprinkle it in the middle.’

The mother was once a friend of Vahey and his wife Jean, 66, who is the executive director of the European Council of International Schools.

An FBI affidavit obtained by the Daily Mail showed how he catalogued the abuse by time and location in folders on a USB memory stick entitled ‘Panama trip’, ‘Costa Rica trip’ and ‘Basketball trip’ and ‘Spring 2013’.

The document says: ‘These images depict minor males in various states of undress... The minor males appear to be asleep, unconscious or possibly drugged.’

Vahey, who left Southbank International last year, was only caught after a housekeeper at a school he moved to in Nicaragua stole a memory stick containing the vile images.

She was sacked but later passed the USB stick to administrators at the American School in Managua, who dismissed Vahey after recognising his hand in the images.

In 1970, while studying for a teaching degree, Vahey was jailed for 90 days after pleading guilty to molesting boys at a swimming pool where he was working as an instructor in California.

He was required to register as a sex offender for life, but after graduating from college in 1972 failed to sign the register.

In 2010 an inspection report had warned of a weakness in staff vetting measures at Southbank International, but Sir Chris Woodhead, chairman of the governors said yesterday that it was ‘irrelevant’ in Vahey’s case as he was not on the sex offender’s register.

Sir Chris said there had never been a complaint against Vahey, although there was one incident where a boy was ill on a trip and Vahey took the boy into his room to look after him.

A school investigation subsequently found ‘nothing untoward’.
