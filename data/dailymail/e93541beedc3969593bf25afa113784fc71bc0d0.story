Guest editor: Musician PJ Harvey's Today treated listeners to segments from radical journalist John Pilger and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange

The BBC was under fire last night over claims that a celebrity edition of its flagship radio news programme had been dominated by ‘left-wing claptrap’.

The Today programme on Radio 4 faced criticism from across the political spectrum after it gave editorial control to cult musician P J Harvey, who filled the show with polemics from left-wing activists and bizarre musical interludes.

Radical journalist John Pilger was given air-time to attack David Cameron and Barack Obama, and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted for sex offences in Sweden, was hailed for his ‘great courage’ and given a Thought for the Day slot, in which he attacked State control.

Listeners were also subjected to a poem from an inmate of Guantanamo Bay and a rant against the Olympics. Critics of the tone and content of the show included a former aide to Gordon Brown, the BBC’s political editor and a Tory Cabinet minister.

Tory MPs suggested the programme – one of a series produced under the guidance of ‘guest editors’ – may have breached the BBC’s duty of political impartiality.

Labour MP Ian Austin, a former minister who served as a close aide to Gordon Brown, said yesterday’s show was the worst he had heard in 30 years of listening.

On Twitter, he said: ‘Quick, the BBC need a guest editor to continue Today’s balanced reporting of global affairs. Are Putin, Ahmedinejad or Assad available tomorrow?’

Welsh Secretary David Jones added: ‘Today’s BBC Radio Today programme is apparently the work of a “guest editor”. Have to wonder who extended the invitation.’

Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘The BBC has a duty to provide balanced factual report and analysis of the day’s news – instead their flagship news and current affairs programme consisted of three hours of left-wing claptrap complete with conspiracy theories, monologues and folk music.’

Public reaction to the show was divided, with some Twitter users branding it ‘left-wing tosh’, but others describing it as ‘powerful and thought-provoking’.

One Tweet said, ‘What has BBC Radio 4 got for us tomorrow? Some sixth form Debating Society leftie reject? Pitiful drivel today.’

A comment left on the Guardian’s website – where many posters were supportive – read: ‘P J Harvey – what an utter embarrassment to the BBC and the UK. It was like giving editorship to an angry sixth-former, desperate to impart their ignorant and facile vituperations upon us all.’

BBC political editor Nick Robinson weighed in, criticising Mr Pilger’s suggestion that the corporation should not have broadcast tributes to Nelson Mandela from Mr Obama because he had failed to close Guantanamo Bay, or from Mr Cameron because he had visited South Africa during the Apartheid era.

In a seven-minute diatribe against the ‘criminal power of our government’, Mr Pilger also suggested the centuries-old conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims had been caused by the British and American invasion of Iraq in 2003.

On Twitter, Mr Robinson said: ‘Pilger always thought-provoking but was he really suggesting that BBC ignore Obama’s Mandela grief as he is a hypocrite? Or Sunni Shia massacres in Syria as Blair & Bush’s fault? Surely, John, those are what we call opinions not facts?’

The decision to give free rein to Assange provoked particular anger.

Tory MP Julian Lewis said it was extraordinary that the WikiLeaks founder, who is hiding from justice in the Ecuadorian embassy in  London, was given an unchallenged platform for his views.

In a special Thought for the Day slot, Assange said: ‘To keep a person ignorant is to place them in a cage. And so it follows that the powerful – if they want to keep their power – will try to know as much about us as they can, and they will try to make sure that we know as little about them as is possible.’

Mr Lewis said: ‘There was no attempt to put an opposing point of view – it was a breach of the BBC’s duty to impartiality. It is not good enough for the BBC to say it is balanced because they have someone putting a right-wing point of view on another issue on another day.’

But Labour backbencher Diane Abbott said Miss Harvey should guest-edit the show ‘every day’.

Yesterday’s show also featured a series of poetry readings by actor Ralph Fiennes, including one by Shaker Aamer, the last British resident held in Guantanamo Bay.

A weather forecast was replaced by Tom Waits’s song Strange Weather and there were several other musical interludes.

Miss Harvey said she agreed to edit the programme only after extracting a promise from the BBC that contributors would be ‘heard in a manner of their choosing, whether that be a monologue, a poem, or interviewing others’.

A BBC spokesman last night said the corporation had no plans to review its use of guest editors over the festive period, adding: ‘The well-established role of the guest editors is to bring their own unique ideas and expertise to the Today programme, working closely with the regular programme team to ensure the material meets the BBC’s editorial guidelines.’
