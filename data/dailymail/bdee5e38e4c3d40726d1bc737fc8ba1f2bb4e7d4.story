A social networking website for Cambridge University has been shut down after students were accused of cyber-bullying.

The Library Whispers site was set up by students to spice up exam revision by exchanging anonymous comments from libraries around the Cambridge campus and displaying them in a real time stream, similar to Twitter.

But the popular website was forced to close today after 'bullying and abusive messages' from a 'large number of individuals' were posted.

Taken down: Library Whispers, a social networking website for Cambridge University students, has been shut due to 'bullying and abusive messages' from a 'large number of individuals'

Forced to go offline: Site creator Oliver Rees in Cambridge today

Comments included sexist and offensive remarks such as 'Just spat on a working-class person'.

One of its creators, Oliver Rees, said the website had turned into a 'forum of hate' and that they had to close it before something 'really bad happened'.

He wrote on the Library Whispers homepage: 'First, apologies to those who used Library Whispers to share innocent and interesting whispers on this site.

'Because of an unfortunately large number of individuals who abused Library Whispers and who posted the worst sort of bullying and abusive messages on the site, Library Whispers 2012 has had to close.

'The site was started to give people the opportunity to break the boring revision period with a bit of interest, but it has turned into a forum of hate and revealed that, sadly, there are a lot of angry people in Cambridge.

'The decision to close the site was taken before anything really bad happened on Library Whispers, and to prevent individuals from showing themselves to be complete idiots without a thought for the feelings of other people'

Obscene: Some of the offensive comments left on the website and which caused it to be shut down

The website was set up last year by a group of students to communicate in university libraries.

Each library could be 'whispered' from but there was no other information to identify the poster

The site took off almost immediately and saw over 1,000 posts within five days.

The founders said at the time: 'We’ve 
had people arranging midnight liaisons, secret updates about librarians,
indecent propositions and May Ball leaks.'

But this term they said the number of offensive comments posted on the website had escalated.

Comments
included one from a student at Trinity College which said: 'Don’t worry
she was a female arts student. Female x arts = second order, so can be 
ignored.'

Prestigious: But Cambridge University students made sexist and offensive remarks such as 'Just spat on a working-class person'

Privileged: Last week, students shocked locals by stripping off, vomiting and urinating in flower beds after drinking themselves into oblivion in a public park

Another student from Pembroke College posted: 'I hate this f****** library and every single person inside it. I hope you all fail your exams.'

Others said: 'I can hear you clicking at your f****** card game through my headphones you inconsiderate d***' and 'crazy laughing b**** in the corner please desist'.

It comes just a week after 2000 Cambridge University students horrified local residents when they partied in a public park on a Sunday afternoon.

They were seen playing rude drinking games, urinating in bushes and vomiting in front of young families.
