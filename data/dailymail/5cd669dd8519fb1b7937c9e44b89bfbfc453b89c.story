The two Taliban commanders who executed a helpless 22-year-old Afghan woman because 'they could not decide who could have her' have themselves been put to death, it has emerged.

Footage posted online yesterday purported to show a burqa-clad woman being gunned down with an AK47 as baying villagers cheered in delight.

The woman, named only as Najiba, was reportedly part of a Taliban love triangle - married to a member of the hardline militant group - and accused of adultery with a commander.

The horrific pictures, showing a crowd of bearded men gathering to watch a rifle-wielding gunman shoot her in the head and back - have sparked worldwide revulsion.

Both British Foreign Secretary William Hague and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have condemned the killing in Qimchok village, in Afghanistan's Parwan province.

Mr Hague said he was 'shocked and disgusted' by the reports of the execution and said: 'Such deplorable actions underline the vital need for better protection of the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan.'

The Afghanistan Human Rights Commission also expressed outrage.

Executive director Mohammad Musa Mahmodi said: 'We condemn any killings done without proper trial. It is un-Islamic and against any human rights values.'

And Hillary Clinton, addressing a world conference on Afghanistan's future, said: 'The United States believes strongly that no nation can achieve peace, stability and economic growth if half the population is not empowered.'

A 30-year-old woman and two of her children were beheaded in Afghanistan earlier this week as part of an honour-killing.

The woman Serata's divorced husband is said to have barged into her house in the capital of Ghazni province and murdered her.

He then killed their eight-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter because they had watched the attack.

A pregnant Afghan woman was publicly executed by Taliban militants for alleged adultery in August 2010.

Bibi Sanubar, 48, was flogged up to 200 times before being shot in the head and chest in the remote Qades district. Her alleged lover managed to escape.

Abdul Jabbar Khan, security chief in the Taliban-controlled area, said the killing was ordered after the woman allegedly killed her newborn child to conceal illicit sex.

The Taliban were accused last month of poisoning schoolgirls by bribing students and workers to sneak toxic chemicals into drinking water or spread it around school grounds.

Six schools in northern Takhar province were affected - as they tried to stop females from going to school and gain an education.

Afghan teenager Mumtaz, 18, was left scarred for life after the man she turned down in marriage attacked her with acid.

One night several men showed up at their home and attacked her family.

Finally two armed men held her, pulled her head back, and let the man who had wanted to marry her pour acid all over her face.

Amateur footage of the brutal killing was posted online and 
shows the woman, known only as Najiba, slump to the floor, as dozens of 
men on a nearby hillside cheer, 'God is great!'

The unidentified shooter, who is seen 
wearing an orange pakol (the traditional Afghan hat), swiftly executes her - but continues to shoot 
her dead body whilst walking towards it.

Officials in Afghanistan said the killing came about due to a dispute between two Taliban members, who had argued over the woman.

Parwan province governor Abdul Basir Salangi told CNN that as both Taliban men 'had some kind of relationship with the woman', they instead opted to accuse her of adultery to 'save face'.

The harrowing images came from an 
undated video, although it is thought the Afghanistan execution took 
place some time in late June.

The video was handed over by a Qol 
villager to the Parwan provincial government, situated north of Kabul, 
their spokeswoman Roshna Khalid told AFP today.

It is understood that both Taliban commanders have subsequently been executed. The video has been condemned by the Afghan government as un-Islamic and inhuman.

Public executions of alleged adulterers were common when the Taliban regime was in power.

They were in control of the country from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted by a US-led invasion for harbouring Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks.

It came as Afghan suicide bombers today killed two children and wounded six others, when their explosive vests detonated prematurely as they went to attack police.

The three bombers were on a motorcycle when their explosives went off in southern Kandahar city, killing and wounding children playing nearby, provincial spokesman Jawed Faisal said.

Shortly afterwards a group of armed insurgents launched an attack on police headquarters in the volatile capital, the spiritual birthplace of the hardline Islamist Taliban.

'Probably the three bombers who blew up and killed children were going to join the attack,' Faisal said. The children were aged between eight and twelve and were playing at the time of the explosion.

The attack on the police headquarters, some 2 miles away, began with an explosion and continued for around an hour after at least three insurgents took over a nearby school and fired on police.

Six people, including two policemen, were wounded before all three attackers were killed, provincial police chief General Abdul Raziq said.

'Police handled the situation professionally. All three attackers were killed. Unfortunately six, including two police, were wounded,' he said.
