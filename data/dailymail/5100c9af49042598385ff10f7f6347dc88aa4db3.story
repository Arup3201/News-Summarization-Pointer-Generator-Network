Manchester United now boast an attacking triumvirate to rival the best in the Premier League.

In adding Radamel Falcao to Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, Louis van Gaal has assembled a front three which will certainly make for exciting viewing this season.

But how do they compare to each other? Sportsmail's CRAIG HOPE takes a closer look… 

RADAMEL FALCAO 

GOALSCORING

Goals are the currency in which the Colombian trades, with Falcao once admitting he is ‘obsessed’ with finding the back of the net. His numbers tally; 155 goals in 200 games since moving to Europe in 2009. Like Van Persie, though, you can’t score from the treatment room, but if he’s on the park then goals are as good as guaranteed.

SCORE: 9/10

Guaranteed: Manchester United's deadline day signing Radamel Falcao's stock in trade is goals

ASSISTS

His obsession with goals evidently doesn’t extend to laying them on for team-mates. Indeed, he has made just four in the past three seasons, although 73 chances created suggests his colleagues may have let him down in converting such opportunities – Falcao himself would not be so wasteful.

SCORE: 7/10

LEADERSHIP

He’s never been a captain but has a powerful personality and an aura which should inspire others. His presence on the pitch can only be a good thing for a team lacking character in the past 12 months.

SCORE: 7/10

Strong return: Falcao's scored 155 goals in 200 games since his move to Europe

STAR QUALITY

His picture populated pretty much every back page across Europe following his deadline-day move to Old Trafford, and that is evidence enough of his star attraction. In the Premier League and United he now has a stage to amplify his allure.

SCORE: 8.5/10

TOTAL: 31.5/40  

WAYNE ROONEY

GOALSCORING

In 10 seasons at United his numbers equate to as good as one goal every two games. But that ratio is old money, the top strikers today return at least two in three (like Daniel Sturridge) or one in one (like Luis Suarez).

Rooney was at the peak of his powers in 2012 – 34 goals bear testament to such – but his potency is on the wane and you fear the days of him plundering 20-plus league goals are a thing of the past.

SCORE: 7.5/10

Falling short: Wayne Rooney's return of a goal every two games is well short of top, top strikers these days

ASSISTS 

Rooney is arguably a better creator of goals than scorer of them - he had a hand in 19 for team-mates in all competitions last season - and few can rival him when it comes to picking a deft pass in and around the danger zone.

SCORE: 9/10

Provider: Of United's star trio, Rooney is the best at laying on goals for others and picking out deft a pass

LEADERSHIP

Let’s be honest, his England captaincy came about by default and, at United, only Van Persie represented a realistic rival. Rather, it is Rooney’s reputation and status which has seen him inherit the armband for club and country, for he is not a natural leader in the mould of Bryan Robson, Roy Keane or Alan Shearer.

SCORE: 6.5/10

Default: Who else could Roy Hodgson have handed the England captaincy to after Steven Gerrard retired

STAR QUALITY

Nike commercials, FIFA covers, Rooney is still a huge name off the field. On it, however, he has to repair a reputation damaged by another failed showing at a major tournament and, of course, the disappointment of last season with United.

SCORE: 7.5/10

TOTAL: 30.5/40

ROBIN VAN PERSIE

GOALSCORING

His first season at Old Trafford was phenomenal and, without his 26 goals, Sir Alex Ferguson would not have signed off with a Premier League title. But you can’t get goals from the stands and Van Persie’s fitness issues could hinder his chances to recreate that free-scoring form. Don’t forget, he has only netted more than 20 league goals in two seasons during his entire career – his last at Arsenal and first at Old Trafford.

SCORE: 8/10

Injury prone: Robin van Persie's extensive time off the pitch has diminished his value

Better days: Van Persie is a long way from his 26-goal season that helped Sir Alex Ferguson retire as a winner

ASSISTS

He’s a little more selfish than Rooney but nonetheless has still carved 21 goals for comrades over the last three seasons, his vision and cute left boot having created an impressive 180 chances in that same period.

SCORE: 8/10

LEADERSHIP

Captain of his country under Van Gaal, Van Persie still doesn’t fall in the category of chest-thumping general. There is a maturity about his mindset and persona, however, and he automatically commands respect from team-mates.

SCORE: 7.5/10

Commands respect: Van Persie isn't a chest-beating general but is revered within United's ranks

STAR QUALITY

He’s not as interested as Rooney in promoting the ‘brand’, but ability and reputation has it that he remains a global star. His diving header against Spain at the World Cup did him no harm in that respect, but memory of last season in the Premier League – form and fitness having eluded him – means he has a point to prove this time around.

SCORE: 7.5/10

TOTAL: 31/40 

Spectacular: Van Persie's goal against Spain for Holland was among the World Cup's great moments
