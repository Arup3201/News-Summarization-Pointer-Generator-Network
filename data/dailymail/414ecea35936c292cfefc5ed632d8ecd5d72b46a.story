Suspended: Doctor Mohammed Al-Byati has been suspended by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester

An Iraqi doctor who spent seven years in the NHS after working at the heart of Saddam Hussein’s brutal regime was banned from practising yesterday for being complicit in torture.

Mohammed Al-Byati, 47, was branded an ‘accessory to torture’ who knew that injured detainees he treated at Iraq’s notorious intelligence HQ had been subjected to violent interrogation.

The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester ruled the father-of-three must have known they would be tortured again after he had treated them.

It imposed the maximum 12-month suspension on his medical registration, but did not strike him off, accepting his claim he had only been following orders during his mandatory military service as a junior doctor and hadn’t taken part in torture.

Dr Al-Byati, who lives in Birmingham, left Iraq in 1995, coming to Britain five years later and working in NHS hospitals from 2004, specialising in rheumatology.

But in 2007 his work permit expired and, fearing being sent back to his homeland at the height of sectarian violence, he applied for asylum on the grounds he had worked for Saddam’s hated regime.

Professor Michael Whitehouse, chairman of the fitness to practise panel, said the ban was needed ‘to demonstrate clearly to him, the profession and the public that even though his involvement as an accessory to torture was outside his control, such conduct is unacceptable’.

But Professor Whitehouse added: ‘He was a junior doctor whose behaviour was being controlled by a dictatorial, totalitarian regime which used systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights to control the population. Dissent from orders was not tolerated.’

The panel said no complaints had been lodged about his conduct since arriving in Britain.

Dr Al-Byati is understood to have been granted asylum with his family, including a son aged nine who was born in Britain.
