That Manchester City continue to make the concept of a striker seem wholly unnecessary is why we cannot pack away this title race along with the Christmas decorations.

It is six goals and six points since Manuel Pellegrini had a recognised centre-forward on the pitch. And that was an 18-year-old called up in emergency.

Chelsea hold the lead in the Premier League table, but this is an impressive sequence City are assembling shorn of their most potent goalscorers.

At The Hawthorns James Milner was again asked for his best Sergio Aguero impression up front. Again the Argentine’s absence through injury was not felt due to the intelligence and industry of City’s outfield Englishman.

Not missed either were Edin Dzeko or Stevan Jovetic, who was at least fit enough for a place on the bench.

In a quick-fire start that stunned West Bromwich Albion, Fernando scored his first goal for City, Yaya Toure hammered home a penalty and David Silva stroked in a sumptuous finish to give City a 3-0 advantage by the 34th minute.

The closest that lead looked to disappearing came when the pitch was blanketed with snow in the second half and the ball was at times barely visible.

As the white stuff fell, Joe Hart horribly mistimed a punch to Chris Brunt’s corner with three minutes left to hand West Bromwich Albion a consolation. The ball hit Bacary Sagna then brushed the back of Brown Ideye’s head to cross the line.

A priceless gift for a striker without a Premier League goal since his £9million move – but worthless in the context of this game.

The real story was that Pellegrini could enjoy a seventh straight league win by taking off Silva and Toure with more than 20 minutes left in preparation for the visit of Burnley on Sunday.

City will go into that buoyed by their performance in this opening period. Their attacks were clinical and fluid, too fast for Albion’s defence to deal with. Milner, Silva, Samir Nasri and Jesus Navas worked as a carousel, interchanging positions and exchanging passes.

That is not to deny the hosts offered far too much seasonal good will. The first two goals were defensive errors gobbled up with glee.

Ben Foster was guilty of a worse mistake than Hart – with bad weather not yet a mitigating factor – and Joleon Lescott conceded a spot-kick with a lunge that was not really necessary. Lescott, captaining West Brom, failed to have the kind of game he would have hoped for against the manager who jettisoned him last season.

By half-time, Pellegrini knew the points were won and City relaxed to conserve energy for this busy period.

They were ahead in the eighth minute. Albion had already looked susceptible to the speed with which City attacked but how they actually went behind was entirely avoidable.

Navas fired a cross that looped off Craig Gardner into the area. Foster reached to claim instead of leave but succeeded only in palming the ball down to the spot Fernando had walked into. The Brazilian hooked a finish back over his head past Gareth McAuley on the line.

Five minutes later the lead was doubled. Silva advanced and tried to slip in Navas but Lescott placed a foot in the way. As the ball bounced loose, Silva nipped in and Lescott’s challenge brought down the Spaniard just inside the area.

Mark Clattenburg instantly pointed to the spot, dismissing Lescott’s claims he got the ball. Replays showed he had but only ever so slightly, as gently as those flakes falling from the sky touched the grass. The award was fair.

Toure ran up and belted his penalty into the corner, his sixth goal in an increasingly productive campaign. The manner he played this game suggested City had handed him an especially large Christmas cake.

By this stage, those in the home stands sensed a drubbing. On the half-hour mark a slick attack saw Navas feed Silva who lifted badly over. He made no mistake 11 minutes before the interval.

Fernando pounced on a loose ball in front of James Morrison, advancing and giving possession to Navas, who cut back for Silva. There was a shimmy and caressed left-foot finish, more pass than shot. Wrong-footed Foster had no chance. 3-0, job done. Only the conditions and energy conservation limited City’s scoring here.

Albion did threaten intermittently. Before the break Saido Berahino, on his first start since December 2, should have done better than hook two finishes wide when played in by Morrison and in the second half Silvestre Varela miscued from close range from a good Stephane Sessegnon cross.

Although Eliaquim Mangala was largely composed, he did err to hand grant Morrison a chance from distance that Hart had to save. Later, Lescott could have atoned with a goal but headed over inside the six-yard box. Pellegrini revealed Vincent Kompany could be fit to return for the Burnley game.

City failed to keep a fifth successive clean sheet due to Hart’s late lapse but recorded a ninth straight win in all competitions to equal a club record.

Milner celebrated by stripping of his shirt and flinging it to the away crowd, a brave call given the temperature. But just as brave as his performance the previous 90 minutes. Those City supporters sung of their status as champions with great gusto, in full belief they can retain their title yet.
