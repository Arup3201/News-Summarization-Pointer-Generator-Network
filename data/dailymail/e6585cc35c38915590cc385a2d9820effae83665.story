New York’s first and only Cat Cafe opened its doors to human visitors on Thursday, sparking lines around a block in Downtown Manhattan.

The Cat Cafe, a pop-up operated by Purina One, will remain open for four days and during that time patrons will have the opportunity to canoodle with 16 furry rescue cats, all of whom are available for adoption.

The North Shore Animal League partnered with Purina One to supply the cats from its center in Port Washington, New York.

All are available for adoption, and each is introduced by way of a portrait wall directly beyond the coffee counter. By mid-afternoon on day one, six of the 16 cats had been adopted by willing visitors.

The cafe itself is located in a temporary space that has been completely transformed into a 
cat-friendly environment. Rug covered perches line the sunny windows and
 the floor is littered with toys for the felines to play with. The cats 
themselves are free to roam while customers can sip complimentary 
‘cat'achino’ coffees practically made for Instagram.

A carer on hand at the cafe told 
MailOnline: ‘All these cats are used to being together and they have
 been verified by our carers as being friendly, agreeable pets.’

But pet adoption isn't The Cat Cafe's sole goal. Throughout its four day operation, Purina One and The North Shore Animal League hope to kick-start a dialogue about cat health and wellbeing.

‘We’re trying to foster a conversation around cat health, and the best conversations happen among friends over a cup of coffee,’ Nicky Roberts from the Purina One brand team explained, ‘Cat people want to be among cats, so it made sense to bring the two together.'

The Cat Cafe will also host free ‘cat chats’ with experts and special guests. Carrie Ann Inaba, a judge on ABC’s Dancing With The Stars and a champion for cats through her rescue organization, spoke at an event this morning, and other experts and vets will be holding panels throughout next four days on everything from cat-friendly interior design to introducing a new cat to your family.

‘We’d seen coverage of cat cafes in 
Europe and Asia, and they seemed to be really popular,’ Roberts told 
MailOnline, ‘We heard there were some starting up here in the States, 
but none had actually opened yet. So we figured, why don’t we? If you 
want to have a conversation around cat health, what else would you do 
but open a cat cafe?’

Cat got your tongue? Visitors were offered 'cat'achinos' in the cafe, complete with feline faces in the foam

Cat'achino, anyone? Even the coffee offering had a feline theme at the Purina One cafe

Is this fur real? Cat lovers lined the corner of Bowery and Kenmare Street in Downtown Manhattan on Thursday afternoon for a chance to visit the Cat Cafe

Visitors are welcome to hold the animals, pet them and take photos with friends. And the felines seemed to enjoy the experience too. One was practically preening as a crowd of adoring cat-lovers snapped away with their iPhones.

‘We wanted to make the cat cafe cat health personified, with the picture of cat health, running around,’ Roberts told MailOnline. ‘When you think of cat health, it sounds so clinical. We wanted something cat lovers could enjoy.’

New Yorkers can visit the Cat Cafe from April 24-27 at 168 Bowery, or watch The Cat Cafe's 'cat chats' on Livestream.
