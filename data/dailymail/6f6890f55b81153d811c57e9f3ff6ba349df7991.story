Multinational firms such as Google and Amazon would have to declare what tax they pay across the world under plans for a 'global standard' to help put an end to tax avoidance.

The G8 agreed that tax authorities 'should automatically share information to fight the scourge of tax evasion'.

Britain is to lead the way by creating a central registry of information of who owns and controls companies, which the firms themselves will be required by law to declare.

Talking tough: Tax is top of the agenda at the G8 today, where leaders posed for the traditional family photo in Lough Erne. G8 and EU leaders pictured left to right are European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron, US President Barack Obama, France's President Francois Hollande, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Italy's Prime Minister Enrico Letta and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy

Tax authorities and police will have 
access to the database and the Government will consult on whether it 
should also be made public.

The aim of the register is to stop 
wealthy individuals and corporations creating complex webs of offshore 
companies to try to dodge tax.

David Cameron said the declaration 
would help ensure 'proper tax justice'. '[It] has the potential to 
rewrite the rules on tax and transparency for the benefit of countries 
right across the world, including the poorest countries in the world,' 
he added.

'We have commissioned a new 
international mechanism that will identify where multinational companies
are earning their profits and paying their taxes so we can track and 
expose those who aren't paying their fair share.'

But the ten-point document, released 
after two days of talks at Lough Erne, fell short of the demands of 
anti-poverty campaigners, who want the developing world included in the 
new arrangements from the start and have called for all countries to 
make tax information publicly available.

One of Mr Cameron's advisers at the 
summit said African countries are losing twice as much in tax avoidance 
as they receive in foreign aid from the West.

Sally Copley, spokesman for the IF 
campaign on global hunger, said: 'Today's G8 tax deal is a step in the 
right direction, but it also leaves major unfinished business.

'It's progress that more tax 
authorities will know who owns phantom firms so they can crack down on 
them, but a summit focused on transparency can't justify keeping this 
information secret.'

But Katja Hall, CBI Chief Policy 
Director, said: 'We'd strongly oppose full country-by-country reporting 
in the future, which would risk swamping people in highly complex data, 
rather than improving transparency.'

At
the weekend Britain secured agreement from 10 of its overseas 
territories and Crown dependencies, widely viewed as tax havens, to sign
up to a new OECD standard on the exchange of tax information.

David Cameron took advantage of the opportunity to have an outdoor swim before work today.

The gathering of leaders from the world's biggest economies is taking place in a luxury golfing resort on the banks of Lower Lough Erne.

the waters of the lake are temptingly visible from the conference rooms where the Prime Minister and his guests are discussing tax, trade and the civil war in Syria.

As the early-morning mists cleared to reveal sunny blue skies for the second day of the summit, Mr Cameron took a quick dip in the water before having his breakfast and joining his guests for the first working session of the day, on counter-terrorism.

It was not immediately clear whether the other leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin who is known for his taste for macho outdoor sports, also took to the water.

Chancellor George Osborne signalled that ‘concrete steps’ would be agreed at the G8 summit at Lough Erne in Enniskillen.

He
warned that action was need on the ‘rules about tax that have been in 
place for decades but, as the world has developed, haven't really kept 
up’.

He told BBC Breakfast: 
‘As a result, individuals can hide the taxes they are supposed to pay in
the international banking system and companies are able to shift their 
profits around the globe, away from where those profits are actually 
generated and therefore they don't pay tax.

‘That's really important because that is less money for our NHS and our schools and the things we need to invest in.’

He signalled that the plan being 
pushed at G8 was focussed on rewriting international rules that allow 
companies to shift their profits away from the UK or any other country 
where they are doing business.

A
key feature of the proposals on the table at Lough Erne is support for a
new regime of exchange of tax information, so that countries will be 
able to know details of offshore accounts held by companies or 
individuals overseas.

Britain
is planning to take part in a pilot scheme later this year to trial the
new rules ahead of the introduction of new OECD standards, and wants to
sign up other countries.

Mr
Cameron also wants greater transparency about so-called ‘beneficial 
ownership’ to make clear who is the ultimate owner of a company and make
it more difficult to operate ‘shell companies’ which often carry out no
business activity, but exist only to hide the true source of income 
from tax authorities.

Britain
has often been seen as an international black sheep on tax havens, 
thanks to the practices in its overseas territories and crown 
dependencies like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the 
Isle of Man.

But Mr Osborne
said their agreement in London on Saturday to accept the new OECD code 
showed the UK was ‘putting our house in order’.

Meeting: Mr Cameron has been at pains to stress the informality of talks at the summit

Middle man: Mr Cameron found himself seated between Mr Putin and Mr Obama who last night staged an uneasy press conference where divisions over Syria were laid bare

Transparency: Mr Cameron has placed a heavy emphasis on securing a global agreement on cracking down on tax avoidance

Anti-poverty campaigners have welcomed Mr Cameron's decision to focus the G8 agenda during Britain's year-long presidency on tax transparency, arguing that it is the poorest countries in the world which lose out most from individuals and companies secreting their wealth in offshore boltholes.

However, Adrian Lovett, Europe executive director at development campaign group One, warned that any agreement on the exchange of tax information must include the developing world, and not just the rich nations of the G8.

And he called for public registries of tax information, to allow investigations not only by tax authorities but also by campaign groups and the media.

‘The G8 must also ensure that the system they put in place for sharing tax information involves developing countries from the start,’ said Mr Lovett.

‘By taking these steps, the G8 will not only put its own house in order, but do so in ways that help the fight against extreme poverty. The UK must continue to lead the way and lobby its G8 partners, with no let-up in pace or ambition. G8 leaders must decide whether they want to shape the transparency revolution or resist the tide of history.’
