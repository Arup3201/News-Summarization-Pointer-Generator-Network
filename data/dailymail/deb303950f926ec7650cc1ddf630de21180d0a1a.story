Residents angry after a 12-year-old boy was charged with setting a fire that leveled three buildings and left 75 people homeless Thursday.

Now in custody, the young boy stands accused of intentionally setting a Lewiston, Maine fire April 29 that left no one injured but killed several pets and destroyed two occupied apartment buildings, leaving dozens to try and make sense of it all.

One of those confused and displaced tenants is Jessica Marie Foster. Though only just informed of the suspect’s age, Foster wasn’t shy about venting her frustrations.

Blaze: A 12-year-old is charged with arson in the massive fire that destroyed three apartment buildings, one pictured, April 29 in Lewiston, Maine

‘I was in the middle of packing to move to Boston to start a new life with my husband and make some positive changes and get away from this place I call hell,’ she told the Sun Journal.

‘That too will be put on hold. This little child has taken so much from all of us and I hope he gets the maximum punishment possible!’

And she had even more reason to be angry. Foster also lost her livelihood.

‘This destroyed me, not because the flat-screen TV I [lost], or the computer, or even the clothes and shoes I loved, but drawings and cards my husband had done for me. Not the fact I even lost all my hair tools I had. I graduated from cosmetology school and recently received my temporary cosmetology license, allowing me to work in a salon...that will be on hold now, for I have nothing!’

Blame game: Firefighters put out the flames despite fears they might not contain the massive blaze. Now those who lost everything wonder who to blame when the suspect is a child

Young: Lewiston, Maine Police Chief Michael Bussiere stressed the need to protect the accused due to his age

Some weren’t as quick to place the blame.

‘I am just sad,’ said Katie Hunnefield, another among the displaced. ‘I feel bad for the choices that he chose to make. I think he is old enough to know right from wrong. And I'm sorry but I also have to wonder about the guidance and discipline he has been brought up with. Children should know that there are consequences for one's actions.’

And though it causes shock in some, the boy’s age is also a reason to protect him. Officials will not release his name.

Angry: Some affected by the fire felt no remorse from pointing fingers. 'This little child has taken so much from all of us,' said one displaced woman

Which is likely for the best, since previous rumors had swirled that the blaze began after a methamphetamine lab exploded, or due to some other drug activity.

‘I am shocked it would be a 12-year-old boy,’ said Blanche Terjelian, who has friends who lived in the affected buildings. ‘I was informed it was a drug deal gone bad.’

The boy set a fire on a porch behind a condemned apartment building Monday evening, where it spread to that building and two others, authorities said.

Victims: 75 were left displaced from the fire and several house pets were killed

Two of the buildings have already been razed, and the third is due to be torn down next week.

Police declined to comment on the boy's motives or say whether he lived in the condemned building, also to protect his identity.

People were still living in six units even though the building had been condemned a month earlier.

The flames were first seen engulfing a back porch. The blaze grew so large that firefighters worried about having enough water pressure, and the plume of smoke could be seen on weather radar 35 miles away in Portland.

Totaled: Officials say the boy started the fire on a back porch of a condemned building and it spread. All three buildings will be leveled
