The moment a captive polar bear gave birth to two tiny cubs was captured on camera in what is thought to be the first such footage ever taken.

Seven-year-old polar bear Giovanna gave birth to her twins two days ago in the birthing den at the Hellabrunn Zoo in Munich, Germany.

They are the only polar bear cubs to be born in captivity in Europe this year and, incredibly, their mother positioned herself in the direct view of CCTV cameras set up to record the moment.

By yesterday both twins were said to be developing well, with their mother taking excellent care of them. 'They are both regularly drinking her milk. In between they are tumbling around on mum,' the zoo said in a statement.

Giovanna gave birth to the first of the pair at 8.39am on Monday following a short labour. Minutes earlier she had been biting her front paw to counteract the pain of contractions, before the eight-inch-long cub slid out.

The infant cub was hairless, smeared in blood, blind and deaf.

Less than a quarter of an hour later, following another contraction that spurred Giovanna to shake and push her back legs forcefully against the wall, a thin arm, small head and then another arm of another cub came into view.

However, Giovanna was so busy with her first born that she didn't immediately realise that she'd even given birth to a second baby for another 20 minutes.

After finally noticing the tiny second cub she turned her head and picks it up carefully in her mouth before laying it on her leg next to its older sibling to suckle.

Colour footage from surveillance cameras captured both births at close range - the first time anywhere in the world that a polar bear birth has been filmed in colour.

The zoo’s director, Dr. Andreas Knieriem, said: 'It is as if we were there live watching the labour and birth of a polar bear and, as if that weren’t enough, Giovanna showed us not one, but two very different births!'

Hellabrunn Zoo is now bracing itself for a surge in visitors. When Knut the polar bear was born in Berlin Zoo at the end of 2006 the capital's animal park was flooded by visitors keen to catch a glimpse of the cub.

In the meantime, Giovanna has her work cut out merely keeping her youngsters alive. Polar bears are at greater risk of dying in the first week of their lives than any other mammal, thelocal.de reported.

But Hellabrun's curator, Beatrix Köhler, said she was impressed with the polar bear mother's behaviour so far.

'Our female polar bear, Giovanna, is caring for her twins very capably as if she were an experienced mother,' said Ms Köhler. 'But at seven years old she is actually a first-time mum!'

Just like in the wild, Giovanna must take care of her young on her own during their risky early period. Even their father, 14-year-old Yogi, is being kept in a separate enclosure until they are fit and healthy.

Christine Strobl, Munich's mayor and a member of the zoo’s board of directors, said she was also delighted.

'The birth of polar bear cubs is definitely a highlight for any zoo and I am overjoyed that we are able to welcome two cubs at once,' she said.
