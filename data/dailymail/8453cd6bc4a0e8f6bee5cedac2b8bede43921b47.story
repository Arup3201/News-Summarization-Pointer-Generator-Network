Doctors have treated the first case of Google Glass addiction.

An unnamed man, a 31-year-old US navy serviceman, admitted he wore the smart specs for 18 hours a day, removing them only to sleep and wash.

He admitted feeling irritable and argumentative when he wasn't wearing Glass, and that he also wore it in his dreams.

Google founder Sergey Brin (L) and designer Diane von Furstenberg wearing Google's Glass. Now the first owner has been treated for his addiction to his device after he started to wear it in his dreams.

Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is characterized by the problematic use of online video games, computer use, and mobile handheld devices. 

While not officially a clinical diagnosis, individuals with IAD manifest severe emotional, social, and mental dysfunction in multiple areas of daily activities due to their problematic use of technology and the internet.

The man had been using Google's technology for around 18 hours a day – removing it only to sleep and wash – and complained of feeling irritable and argumentative when doctors took his Glass away.

In the two months since he bought the device, he had also begun experiencing his dreams as if viewed through the device's small grey window.

'During his residential treatment program at the Navy's Substance Abuse and Recovery Program (SARP) for alcohol use disorder, it was noted that the patient exhibited significant frustration and irritability related to not being able to use his Google Glass,' the doctors wrote in the journal Addictive Behaviours. 

'The patient exhibited a notable, nearly involuntary movement of the right hand up to his temple area and tapping it with his forefinger. 

'He reported that if he had been prevented from wearing the device while at work, he would become extremely irritable and argumentative.'

However,the man also had other problems. 

'The patient has a history of a mood disorder most consistent with a substance induced hypomania overlaying a depressive disorder, anxiety disorder with characteristics of social phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder, and severe alcohol and tobacco use disorders.'

The patient was admitted for a 35 day residential programme to beat his Glass addiction. 

'Over the course of his 35-day residential treatment, the patient noted a reduction in irritability, reduction in motor movements to his temple to turn on the device, and improvements in his short-term memory and clarity of thought processes.

'He continued to intermittently experience dreams as if looking through the device. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of IAD involving problematic use of Google Glass.'

Internet addiction disorder was not included as a clinical diagnosis in the 2013 update to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the official reference guide to the field, and many researchers maintain that its effects are merely symptoms of other psychological problems.

There's nothing inherently bad about Google Glass,' Doan told The Guardian.

'It's just that there is very little time between these rushes. 

'So for an individual who's looking to escape, for an individual who has underlying mental dysregulation, for people with a predisposition for addiction, technology provides a very convenient way to access these rushes.

'And the danger with wearable technology is that you're allowed to be almost constantly in the closet, while appearing like you're present in the moment.'
