Blackpool coach Jose Riga is wanted by Genk.

The Belgian club sacked manager Emilio Ferrera on Monday after just one game a 3-1 defeat to KV Mechelen.Â 

The 56-year-old Riga has endured a frustrating spell at Blackpool after joining from Charlton and has a fractious relationship with chairman Karl Oyston.

Already off: Riga could leave Blackpool before the season even begins after a disruptive first month at the helm

Familiar face: Delfouneso is no stranger to Bloomfield Road after two previous loan spells

Blackpool added Nathan Delfouneso to their ranks on Tuesday after agreeing terms with Peter Clarke, Jacob Mellis and Tomas Cywka on Monday.

But Delfouneso's official arrival brings the total number of players on the club's books to just 12.

The former Aston Villa striker is no stranger to Bloomfield Road having had two loan spells there in the past, most recently last season.
