Basketball bosses are 'beside themselves with excitement' at Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge attending an NBA game, MailOnline has learned.

The Duke and Duchess will watch the Cleveland Cavaliers take on the Brooklyn Nets during their three-day visit to New York next month.

The decision by the couple to attend the match means they should be able to watch LeBron James, currently America's biggest sports star, in action.

NBA brass believe that the image of the royal couple at the match at Brooklyn's Barclays Center will be shown around the world, helping the sport gain new fans.

'It's an incredible publicity coup for the NBA,' an insider told MailOnline.

'The images of them all together will be seen all over the world - it's a marketing man's dream.'

Insiders say that Kate and William had expressed an interest in attending a basketball game at legendary Madison Square Garden when they were planning their December 7-9 visit to the Big Apple.

But they decided against the the New York Knicks vs Portland Trailblazers game on December 7 in favor of seeing LeBron play the following night.

'Kate and William are both big sports fans,' explains the friend. 

'And although basketball isn't big in Britain, William has heard of LeBron James... although Kate apparently had no idea who he was!'

Adam Silver, the NBA's commissioner -its equivalent of chief executive - will be present at the match. He was said to be beside himself with excitement at the coup.

'All the stars have aligned for them. No wonder Adam Silver is leaping up and down and celebrating. It's perfect timing that Kate and William are visiting New York at the exact same time as LeBron James is in town.'  

The pregnant Duchess might, however, find herself in more familiar company with a couple of other famous faces widely expected to attend the game.

Beyonce and Jay Z are avid Nets fans, and both are expected to be there to watch the hoops action. Even without the royal draw, the Cleveland Cavaliers are a huge draw because of James.

While most attention-seeking celebs sit courtside, the Duke and pregnant Duchess are expected to be viewing the game from the relative safety of a private box.

'I don't think anybody likes the idea of Kate being in the front row and a huge, great basketball player crashing into her - especially in her condition,' says the insider.

The purpose of the royal couple going to the match is to launch 'a new collaboration' including the Royal Foundation, which manages their charitable activities, the National Basketball Association and the United for Wildlife organization, of which Prince William is president. 

United for Wildlife already has a basketball link, with former NBA star Yao Ming as one of its ambassadors, alongside Andy Muray, the tennis player, and David Beckham, the footballer.

The trip to the basketball match will be one of a series of high-profile engagements during the visit, which is the Duke and Duchess's first trip to New York.

Both will be based in New York during the three-day trip, although Prince William will also spend part of the trip in Washington D.C where he will attend an anti-poaching conference. 

The Duchess of Cambridge, meanwhile, will spend the entire visit in New York and is to visit a child development center and host a lunch at the British Consulate while her husband is away.

Prince George won't be joining his parents on the trip and will remain in London with nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo.

The visit is the couple's first to the US since 2011, when they travelled to Los Angeles, a few months after their wedding.

This time, their visit will be confined to the East Coast - completely new territory for both as neither have previously visited it before, in any capacity.

William and Kate will arrive on the evening of the 7th December and will spend their first night in the US at a private dinner on behalf of the American Friends of the Royal Foundation.

The Foundation was set up by Princes Harry and William in 2009 and officially launched in 2011 as the main vehicle for their philanthropic activities, including the Invictus Games.

In addition to promoting the welfare of current and former members of the Armed Forces, the Foundation also works with young people and is committed to supporting conservation efforts.

It is the latter that forms the basis for much of the schedule, with the Duke of Cambridge spending his first full day in the US at an anti-corruption conference at the World Bank in Washington D.C.

Once there, the Duke is expected to call for a zero tolerance approach to the trade in endangered animal parts on behalf of United For Wildlife, a conservation organisation of which he is president.

He will also attend a reception in New York for the Tusk Trust on the same day, before rejoining the Duchess of Cambridge to watch the basketball game. 

The following day, both the Duke and Duchess will visit an inner city youth organisation, focused on social support and learning for poorer children - another key focus for the Royal Foundation.

Also on the agenda is an event celebrating the British creative talent boasted by New York's media and creative industries.

Prince William, who like Prince Charles has long been fascinated with technology, will attend an event hosted by a New York-headquartered technology company, which will bring together entrepreneurs from both the UK and the US.

The final engagement of the visit will be the University of St. Andrews 600th Anniversary Dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

St Andrews was the Scottish university where the Duke and Duchess first met in 2002 after enrolling on the same Master of Arts degree course.

Since leaving the University, the Duchess in particular has become a regular attendee of alumni events, the majority in London.

The New York event is along similar lines and will support scholarships and bursaries for students from underprivileged backgrounds, as well as new student sports facilities.

Earlier versions of this article wrongly stated that the NBA had donated $1 million to The Royal Foundation, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's conservation charity, in return for their appearance at the match. We are happy to clarify that this is not the case and that no donation was made as a result of their collaboration, nor is one expected. We apologise for suggesting otherwise.
