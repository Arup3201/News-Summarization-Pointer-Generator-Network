Mother-of-three: Julie Sillitoe, 49, was crushed by large pieces of masonry which fell from a building

The widower of a taxi driver killed by falling building debris asked her to stay off work due to high winds - but she refused so she could buy him a birthday present, an inquest heard today.

Mother-of-three Julie Sillitoe, 49, of Finsbury, central London, was crushed by large pieces of masonry which fell from a building in High Holborn on Valentine’s Day.

Her two passengers - one of whom was Kylie Minogue's guitarist Luke Fitton - narrowly escaped with their lives after the chunks of cement fell just inches from their heads.

Mr Fitton said he and his girlfriend, fashion blogger girlfriend Bo Houtenbos, had enjoyed a romantic dinner at Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen restaurant - but a building fell ‘out of the sky’ while they were in the taxi.

A large chunk of debris landed on his chest just inches from his face. Mrs Sillitoe was hit by the cement and killed almost instantly in the accident, which happened at around 11pm.

Steve Sillitoe told her inquest at St Pancras Coroner's Court that he had pleaded with her to stay off work because of the bad weather, but she refused so she could buy him a birthday present.

The security consultant choked back tears as he said: ‘She came up and said “I'm going to go to work now”.

'It was very windy outside, it was bad weather. I said to her “Do you have to go to work? Why don't you take the night off?” She said “I have to go to work, I have to buy your birthday present”.’

Mr Sillitoe later sent his wife a text saying he loved her, and she complained that it was very windy.

Passenger Mr Fitton said of the accident: ‘Quite
 instantly, I felt I had a huge piece of concrete on me, and it just 
seemed to go from absolute silence and normality to the complete 
opposite.

'I didn't understand what was going on. I
 was conscious, I was screaming and screaming because the pain was so 
blinding.’ A large piece of concrete landed on his chest, crushing him,
 the inquest heard.

He said 
that he was overwhelmed by dizziness and confusion, and spent what 
seemed ‘like an eternity’ calling out to his girlfriend to check she was
 okay.

He said: ‘People were 
trying to see what was going on and help, and I remember screaming to 
them to get this piece off me. Some piece of concrete.

‘I'm
 not sure how much time was actually passing, but it felt like an 
eternity. Eventually, I got some kind of response from my girlfriend who
 was speaking to the people in the street.

‘I was screaming, shouting, trying to 
get whatever was on me off. It just felt like it was not stopping going 
down, it was crushing, crushing, crushing.’

Widower: Steve Fitton told his wife's inquest how the evening turned into a tragedy he would never forget

Paramedics, police and an air ambulance rushed to the scene and he was cut out of the wreckage of the Skoda Octavia and treated.

But Mrs Sillitoe suffered ‘devastating’ head injuries which killed her. London had seen bad weather and high winds that night and the days immediately before.

Mr Fitton said he had been ‘discussing how horrendous the wind had been that evening’ with Mrs Sillitoe.

He paused several times and spoke very quietly as he told of the impact the tragedy had on him and his girlfriend - and said more could have been done to check the building's safety given the stormy weather.

He said: ‘For myself and my girlfriend, it has changed our lives so much in terms of appreciation that we were lucky in that situation.

‘It makes you reflect and we are saddened that all three of us weren't able to come away from this experience.’

Mr Fitton, who has only just stopped 
using crutches because of his injuries, added: ‘Having no way of 
rationalising how something like this can happen.

‘You
 are not expecting to be worried about travelling home and buildings 
falling out of the sky.’  He said he was still waiting for answers about
 why the accident happened.

Mr Fitton said: ‘People seemed to 
initially respond saying it was an”'act of God”. I feel that is a bit of
 “We can't explain what happened”. I feel there could have been a lot 
more done.

‘This is the UK. 
That was the last of a recurrence of a few days of bad weather. If you 
were concerned with your building it should be checked and maintained.’

Luke Fitton, passenger

According
 to his website, Mr Fitton joined Minogue's live band as lead guitarist 
in October 2010 and performed with her on the Kylie Aphrodite Les Folies
 world tour.

Mrs Sillitoe 
had to be cut from the wreckage of her car, but attempts to resuscitate 
her failed and she died at the scene from a massive head injury.

Mr Sillitoe paid tribute to his ‘fun-loving’ wife, who was looking forward to becoming a grandmother for the second time.

He
 said: ‘She was extremely family orientated - with her granddaughter and
 her sons. Shortly before she learnt that (her son) Ben's partner was 
pregnant again with a girl, which she was overjoyed at.’

He added: ‘It is a number of months since Julie was killed, and every single day I miss her very much.’

Later, the inquest heard that the masonry which fell from the roof of a six-storey Victorian building, killing Mrs Sillitoe, was 6ft long and weighed a tonne and a half.

Building expert Philip Deane, who inspected the site the next day, said very high winds probably caused the debris to dislodge and crash down.

A large Crossrail site being dug nearby which reportedly caused vibrations ‘could be a contributory factor’ to the building falling.

Mr Deane, a chartered structural engineer from Ellis & Moore Consulting Engineers, said he thought high winds caused the accident.

He said: ‘That wind-force hit it with sufficient force that the wall would have tilted at the point of restraint.

‘It would have tilted, the brickwork inside would have failed and the wall would have fallen over. If you subject it to a high enough force, that would have happened.

‘There was nothing that I have seen in looking at the remainder of the building to suggest that it was a badly maintained building.’

He added: ‘In the final instance, it was the wind that brought it down. Over the years vibrations from HGVs could have weakened it.’

Asked if the Victorian building would pass current building regulations, he told the inquest it was ‘close to its limit’, given wind estimates.

Mr Deane said the building's design meant there were ‘inherent possibilities of things going wrong’ and the 6ft parapet which fell was exceptionally large.

Coroner Mary Hassell suggested London could be facing a spate of Victorian and Edwardian building collapses.

Steven Sillitoe, widower

She said: 'One function, an ancillary function of an inquest, is that the Coroner has the power and indeed the duty to report to any person or organisation in the community if evidence comes to light that may prevent loss of life in the future.

‘And what I have in my mind is - when is this going to happen again? When is this going to happen again, not just anywhere in the country, but here in London?

'How do were predict what building is going to lose its parapet? We will have high winds again.'

Mr Deane replied: 'We would have to inspect each building'. The inquest continues.
