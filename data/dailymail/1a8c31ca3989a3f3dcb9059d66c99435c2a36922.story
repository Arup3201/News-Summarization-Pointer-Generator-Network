Exeter City boss Paul Tisdale has named himself on the bench for their opening game of the season against Portsmouth.

The 41-year-old, who is the longest-serving manager in the Football League, registered himself as a player after a sickness bug hit his squad.

He told BBC Sport: 'It's always a difficulty when you've got players who are ill.

'You never quite know if they're going to be 100% or not when it comes to the full-blown match tempo on a Saturday afternoon.

'Hopefully I won't have to put my boots on, but we'll have to see how many people are available.'

Tisdale has played just once in the Football League since 1998, as a last-minute substitute in 2011 for Exeter City to mark his retirement.
