Three young blind people from Phoenix, Arizona, have conquered yet another dream that most would deem unrealistic due to their visual impairment.

Max Ashton, 17, Tanner Robinson, 24, and Katie Cupp, 19 completed the arduous Alcatraz Invitational Swim through the rough waters between Alcatraz Island and Aquatic Park in San Francisco, California, on Sunday.

With the help of sighted swimming guides, Ashton came in first, swimming the 1.25-mile distance in just a little over 50 minutes.

The hardest part of making the swim is staying on a straight line, so Ashton was guided by two brothers, Mike and Paul Tiffany, both of Phoenix, who made sure he did not veer off course.

The brothers said the trip was uneventful, although Ashton clocked one of them when he swam too close.

‘I took a couple of shots in the face from Max,’ said Paul, who has made a total of six Alcatraz swims.

According to Ashton, it feels ‘good to show people I can do everything, really', he said after making it across the bay. ‘I feel great now. This is huge. Next is college.’

This is not the first time the high school college prep senior has done ‘the impossible’.

When he was 13, he climbed Kenya’s Mount Kilimanjaro, and a year later he crossed the Grand Canyon.

The two others who also did the swim, Robinson and Cuppy, were both happy they did it.

Robinson has also climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and made the rim-to-rim trek across the Grand Canyon together with Ashton in fundraising events put on by the Phoenix-based Foundation for Blind Children.

However, the bay swim was ‘the hardest one’ of the challenges, he told the San Francisco Chronicle.

Between 1933 and 1963, the U.S. government sent some of its most dangerous criminals to Alcatraz Island, including the likes of Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly and Whitey Bulgar.

The current in the San Francisco Bay is often strong and unpredictable, which is why of the 36 prison inmates who tried to escape, only six made it out of the waters alive.

Robinson, who works at the secretary of state's office in Arizona, finished in an hour and 16 minutes. 

Happy: Katie Cuppy, 19, who is also blind, is helped up from the water after finishing the swim in one hour and 24 minutes

Nothing is impossible: Cuppy, who is studying special education, says blind people can do anything that a sighted person can

Robinson said he kept going, despite the 
cold water and his novice status as a swimmer, thanks to months of 
training at Arizona's Lake Pleasant.

‘The nice thing about being blind is you don't know where the finish line is,’ he said. ‘It was just like another training.’

Cuppy, who is studying special education and hopes to teach blind children, did the swim in one hour and 24 minutes.

‘This shows we can do anything else a sighted person can do, without limits,’ she said.
