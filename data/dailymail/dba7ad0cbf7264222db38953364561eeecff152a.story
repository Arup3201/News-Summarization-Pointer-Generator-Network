Tom Daley responded strongly after again hitting a stumbling block on his nemesis dive to qualify in first place in defence of his Commonwealth Games 10 metres platform title in Edinburgh on Saturday.

The 20-year-old has had trouble when it comes to the back two-and-a-half somersault with two-and-a-half twists which he describes as his 'demon' and scored just 37.80, after landing with quite a splash.

It was the dive he performed en route to London 2012 Olympic bronze when a camera flash distracted him and he asked to re-perform the dive.

Stumbling block: Tom Daley has struggled with the back two-and-a-half somersault with two-and-a-half twists

The plunge was defending champion Daley's second of six dives and at the end of the round the Plymouth diver appeared on the big screen at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in a recorded message pleading to spectators not to use flash photography.

There was no suggestion of a flash being used on this occasion.

He was 11th of the 11 divers with four rounds remaining, but all were to progress to Saturday evening's final from the morning's preliminaries.

Later U2's Vertigo was played over the public address system, but Daley, bidding for a third Commonwealth gold medal, shrugged off the mishap.

He scored 83.20 with his third dive - an inward 3 1/2 somersault - to move up to eighth place at the halfway point before two scores over 100.

His sensational forward 4 1/2 somersault was rewarded with 101.75 and his back 3 1/2 somersault scored 100.80 to move him into first place with one dive remaining.

Doing enough: Daley finished with a total of 488.85 to go through in first place

Daley finished with a total of 488.85 to go through in first place, with Matthew Mitcham of Australia, the 2008 Olympic champion, second with 450.80.

England's James Denny, who on Friday night won synchronised silver with Daley, was sixth with 408.40, while 14-year-old Matthew Dixon advanced in 10th place with 365.65.

Twelve of 14 divers advanced from the women's three-metres springboard preliminaries, with Canada's Jennifer Abel leading the way.

The one-metre springboard champion scored 336.90 to advance, with England's Hannah Starling (311.05) in fourth, Alicia Blagg (300.70) in sixth and Rebecca Gallantree in 11th.

Grace Reid, who came close to Scotland's first Commonwealth Games diving medal in 56 years in the women's one-metre springboard final on Friday before finishing fifth was also in action.

The 18-year-old from Edinburgh was 10th in qualifying.

Tonga's Maria Zarka (184.40) and Canada's Emma Friesen (194.40) were the divers eliminated.
