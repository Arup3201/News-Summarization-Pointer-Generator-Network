'Repugnant': Andrew Gwndaf Jones, 44, was jailed for perverting the course of justice

A shoplifter who lied about his daughter being killed in a car smash and said he needed bail to attend the funeral has been jailed for perverting the course of justice.

Andrew Gwyndaf Jones made up the horrendous tale when he appeared before magistrates in July this year facing four charges of theft.

The 44-year-old, who had more than 120 previous offences, was set to be remanded in custody after his hearing was adjourned for a week.

But he pleaded with the District Judge who was presiding over the case, saying his daughter had been killed in an accident and that he would miss her funeral if he was not granted bail.

Judge Andrew Shaw agreed to turn Jones loose so that he could be at the service, but his lies were exposed after the girl's mother read a report of proceedings in the local press.

After he had been bailed, friends and relatives of the young girl even began contacting her mother with messages of condolence.

The furious mother contacted police, telling them that her daughter was alive and well and that Jones had made up the story to secure bail.

When approached by officers, the thief said his bail application was in relation to another daughter and then a step-daughter. All his claims proved to be lies.

Having been hauled back before the judge, Jones, of no fixed abode, was jailed for six months for the four shoplifting charges.

He was then charged with perverting the course of justice in relation to the bogus bail submission.

Jailed: Jones was sentenced at Mold Crown Court, above, after the mother of his child told police he had lied about the accident

After pleading guilty at that hearing at Mold Crown Court, Judge Niclas Parry said: 'It is difficult to imagine how anyone could stoop so low.'

Jailing Jones for a further 10 months, the judge said the lie was 'as repugnant as it was serious' and 'struck at the heart of the administration of justice'.

Clare Jones, defending, said that her client had a 26-year drug addiction but was motivated to change and was now providing negative drug tests.

He had been supported by Narcotics Anonymous and since August had been able to put drugs behind him.
