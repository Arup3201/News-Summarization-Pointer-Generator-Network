California's whooping cough epidemic is here to stay. 

The state has seen in 2014 the highest number of whooping cough cases in nearly 70 years — and researchers say big outbreaks may become 'the new normal.'

Data from the California Department of Public Health shows just how low the number of cases of the disease got before it began to spike again in the last few years

Up until Nov. 26, the state has registered 9,935 cases of the illness.

This number is so high, it hadn't been surpassed since the late 1940s, according to the California Department of Public Health.

The last epidemic in California was in 2010, when 9, 159 cases were reported — including 10 deaths.

Public health officials say one of the reasons for the higher number of cases is the use since the '90s of a type of vaccine that causes 'fewer reactions' but does 'not protect as long.'

Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that the most highly affected group was infants.

But there was also a peak in cases among teens ages 14 to 16, according to the CDC. 

What's worse: the CDC warns that cases of the disease among teens is 'likely' to increase 'in the absence of a new vaccine or more effective vaccination strategy.'

'As long as currently available acellular pertussis vaccines are in use, it is likely that the “new normal” will be higher disease incidence throughout pertussis cycles,' the CDC said in its Dec. 5 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
