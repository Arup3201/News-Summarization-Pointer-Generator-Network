The White House has announced that Michelle Obama will bring heroes of the Boston Marathon bombing, an NBA star who came out as gay and a top teacher as her guests to tomorrow night’s State of the Union.

The First Lady always brings a group of apolitical Americans to the annual speech with her to highlight their service and achievements throughout the year.

Some will be recognized by many and this year one of those men will be Carlos Arredondo, who was wearing a white cowboy hat as he rushed a stranger- later identified as Jeff Bauman- to get medical treatment after he lost both legs in the blast.

Out of the ashes: Carlos Arredondo (in the white cowboy hat) helped save Jeff Bauman after he lost both legs in the explosion and now they will both be guests of Mrs Obama at the State of the Union address on Tuesday

Moving past it: The two men, seen here at a September 2013 football game, have become close friends

The iconic picture of Mr Arrendondo rushing Bauman to first responders became a hopeful symbol of the devastating attack.

The White House said that the two men have become close friends.

Heroes of the Boston Marathon bombing, a firefighter who led the rescue response to an Oklahoma tornado, and an openly gay basketball player will be among U.S. first lady Michelle Obama's guests at the State of the Union address on Tuesday.

Another individual whose character came out in a time of crisis was Cary Bird, the fire chief in Moore Oklahoma.

He led the rescue response to the tornado that hit the town and killed 25 people.

‘Fire
 Chief Gary Bird represents all of those who rallied together to help 
the community of Moore, Oklahoma- firefighters, police officers, 
teachers, neighbors- in its greatest time of need,’ the White House said
 in a statement announcing Mrs Obama’s guests.

Tests of character: Jason Collins became the first openly gay basketball player in the NBA after coming out last spring (left) and Cary Bird (right) was the fire chief in Moore, Oklahoma at the time of the tornado that killed 25

Honoring Americans: Mrs Obama is surrounded by people that the administration wants to highlight as heroes and leaders and she is seated with them at the annual State of the Union address (seen here in 2013)

The best-known guest that has been announced so far is Jason Collins, the NBA player who announced that he is gay which made him the first openly gay athlete in the league.

Mrs Obama and the White House put out statements immediately praising Collins when he made his announcement in April, as did former President Bill Clinton and his daughter Chelsea, who has been friends with Collins since they attended Stanford together.

Though the Obamas may have only known 
Collins through his landmark announcement, they first met one of 
Michelle’s guests two years ago.

Joey
 Hudy met President Obama when he was 14 at a White House science fair 
in 2012 and impressed him with his ‘extreme marshmallow cannon’.

Now 16, he is the youngest intern at U.S. chip manufacturer Intel Corp.

Aside
 from current events and natural disasters, the First Lady’s guests are 
regularly selected to help highlight policy initiatives close to the 
administration’s heart, so it comes as little surprise that a public 
school teacher was included in the group.

Kathy Hollowell-Makle was named the 2013 District of Columbia public school teacher of the year and she is known for having the vast majority of her students demonstrate early literacy and advanced reading skills. 

These six guests will join the First Lady, Vice President Joe Biden’s wife Dr Jill Biden and White House advisor Valerie Jarrett in their box tomorrow during the speech.

Last year, a teacher from Sandy Hook Elementary School and Apple CEO Tim Cook were among the chosen few.

In 2012, Gabby Giffords’ husband Mark Kelly, Steve Jobs’ widow Laurene Powell Jobs and Warren Buffett’s secretary Debbie Bosanek were all invited as the First Lady’s guests.
