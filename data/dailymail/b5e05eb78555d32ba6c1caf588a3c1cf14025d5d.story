If you are one of the millions of people who hate popping pills, then you're not alone.

One in three of us would prefer to risk an earlier death  than take a daily pill to prevent heart disease, a study has revealed. 

And one in five of those polled would be willing to pay at least $1,000 (£657) to avoid taking a pill every day for the rest of their lives, the US researchers found.

The new U.S. study reinforces that many of us do not like taking daily medication, the researchers say. A fifth of patients say they would be willing to pay $1,000 (£657) not to take drugs every day

The study 'reinforces the idea that many people do not like taking pills, for whatever reason,' said Dr Robert Hutchins of the University of California, San Francisco.

He added: 'And it reiterates we should be having discussions with patients about what their priorities are.

'[The question is]...if they value the extended life they might get from taking a pill more than the effect on their quality of life for having to take that pill every day for the rest of their life.'

Dr Hutchins and his colleagues designed the survey to find out, hypothetically, how much time at the end of their lives people would be willing to give up just to avoid taking preventive medications every day.

They also asked how much people would pay to avoid having to take pills, and how much of a risk of death they'd accept to avoid taking drugs to prevent heart disease.

The pills would be free, and participants were told to ignore potential side effects.

A thousand people – mostly women and with an average age of 50 – completed the online survey, the researchers reported in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.

In 'real life,' four out of five were taking daily medication, with 54 percent taking at least three pills a day.

In 'real life,' four out of five were taking daily medication, with 54 percent taking at least three pills a day.

Overall, about 70 per cent said they wouldn't trade any weeks of their lives to avoid taking a pill every day.

But more than 8 per cent were willing to trade up to two years of life to avoid taking pills every day. 

And roughly 21 per cent would trade between one week and a year.

About 13 per cent would accept a small risk of death to avoid taking a pill every day, and 9 percent would risk a 10 per cent chance. 

About 62 per cent weren't willing to gamble any risk of immediate death.

On average, respondents said they'd pay $1,445 (£950) to avoid taking a pill each day for the rest of their lives.

However 41 per cent said they wouldn't pay any amount.

Dr Hutchins believes the findings are useful to researchers who are developing new ways to administer medicines.

'What if we can deliver medication like aspirin and statins without someone having to take a pill?

'It would almost certainly increase compliance while also improving that person's quality of life by removing the hassle of having to take a pill daily,' he told Reuters Health. 

However other medical experts warned these study participants might not accurately reflect the general population.

Despite this, it is impressive that such a large number of people would be willing to take medication every day, said Dr Mario Garcia, of the Montefiore-Einstein Center for Heart and Vascular Care in New York.

'There were almost 70 per cent of people who would take a pill a day even to live one week longer, and that's remarkable,' he said.

But on the other hand, he added, people often don't like to pay for medications.

'Clearly people will be compliant if they don't have any side effects,' he said.

'On the other hand, they probably wouldn't be willing to pay out-of-pocket too much.'
