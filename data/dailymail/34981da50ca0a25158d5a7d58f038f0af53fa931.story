Her bombshell looks captured the nation’s attention when she starred in the Profumo affair.

And half a century after the notorious sex scandal rocked the political establishment, Mandy Rice-Davies appears to have lost none of her striking beauty.

Appearing at the launch of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical about the affair, the glamorous 68-year-old could have been mistaken for the much younger actress who will play her on stage.

The former showgirl posed next to Charlotte Blackledge, 21, who will make her professional stage debut when the show opens in London’s Aldwych Theatre in December.

Miss Rice-Davies advised Lloyd Webber on the storyline, but her friend Christine Keeler was nowhere to be seen at yesterday’s launch, having refused to take part.

Miss Keeler’s sexual liaisons with Tory minister John Profumo and Russian naval attaché Yevgeny Ivanov led to one of the biggest political scandals of the 20th century.

But pictured last month, she was almost unrecognisable from the 19-year-old brunette who found herself embroiled in the affair in 1963.

The 71-year-old – who now lives in sheltered accommodation in south London - will be played by actress Charlotte Spencer in Lloyd Webber’s musical.

Then Minister of War, Profumo was forced to quit in disgrace after he lied to the House of Commons about his affair. It was alleged Keeler was asked to spy on him by the Russians. 

They were introduced by society osteopath Stephen Ward - at a party in Cliveden House in Berkshire in 1961.

Ward was later prosecuted for living off the immoral earnings of Miss Rice-Davies and Miss Keeler but took an overdose before his trial ended and died three days after being convicted.

The trial implicated several establishment figures in an underworld of sex and prostitution and damaged the government of Tory prime minister Harold Macmillan.

Giving evidence, Miss Rice-Davies was questioned over her relationship with Viscount Astor, who owned Cliveden House.

After the prosecuting lawyer pointed out he had denied ever having met her, she famously replied: ‘He would, wouldn’t he?’

Lloyd Webber said the trial was ‘one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history’ and said he hoped his musical – entitled Stephen Ward - would help set the record straight.

He said: ‘I find him a fascinating character. He was clearly a life-enhancer. But in no way was he an immoral person.’
