A pharmaceutical company has announced that they will cease production of a prescription cough syrup due to its association with drug sizzurp.

Sizzurp, also known as ‘purple drank’, is made from prescription cough syrup, hard candy and sugary soft drinks, and is popular among rap stars and pop prince-turned-wannabe gangster Justin Bieber.

Actavis say that it is the celebrity glorification of using their ‘Prometh with Codeine cough syrup’ to make sizzurp that has led to the company stopping all production and sales.

Actavis’ cough syrup is only available with a prescription but can allegedly fetch around $800 on the black market, and it is the codeine source of choice for sizzurp fans.

These include rapper Soulja Boy, who frequently posts images of Actavis’ bottles on his Instagram, and according to sources, also teen idol Justin Bieber.

‘Given [recent media attention], Actavis has made the bold and unprecedented decision to cease all production and sales of its Promethazine Codeine product,’ a representative told Tmz.

‘This attention has glamorized the unlawful and dangerous use of the product, which is contrary to its approved indication.’

Sizzurp originated in Houston in the 1960s and has since spread via urban music communities in the southern states to mainstream teenagers via modern glorification of the drug on social media and in lyrics and music videos.

It is made by mixing codeine cough 
syrup, its colour gives the right hue to the drink, and soda, most often
 Sprite or Mountain Dew, and Jolly Rancher candy for extra sweetness.

The drinker experiences an immediate, euphoric high as well as drowsiness and lethargy, and sometimes also hallucinations.

The
 amount of cough syrup in each serving of sizzurp can see a drinker 
consume 25 times the recommended dose of codeine and promethazine.

In 2013, rapper Lil Wayne, a known 
sizzurp fan who even wrote song Me and My Drank about the drug, 
collapsed and suffered multiple seizures.

The
 four-time Grammy Award-winning rapper was rushed to Los Angeles’s 
Cedars Sinai Hospital where doctors allegedly found high amounts of 
codeine in his system.

Sizzurp seize-up: Rapper 2 Chainz has been charged with codeine possession following his arrest last year at Los Angeles International Airport when authorities say he was found with 'sizzurp ingredients' in his baggage

Earlier this month, rapper 2 Chainz was charged with felony drug possession after his arrest last year at Los Angeles International Airport when airport officials reported finding ingredients for sizzurp in his checked baggage.

The 36-year-old entertainer, whose real name is Tauheed Epps, is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday on a felony charge of codeine possession.

In March, Justin Bieber was photographed drinking from the type of Styrofoam cup linked to the drug and insiders claim the pop star spends much of his time smoking marijuana or consuming sizzurp, which is referred to by the singer and his pals as 'lean'.

Sizzurp has also been linked to the deaths of rappers Pimp C in 2008 and Big Moe in 2007, who both died of codeine overdoses.

Danger: Prescription cough syrup from Actavis, now discontinued

Although it is prominent in rap culture in particular, sizzurp has long been popular among teenagers of all backgrounds as a cheap way to get high.

According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, one in ten American teenagers use cough syrup or cold medicine as a recreational drug.

The high-sugar content and mouthfeel of the syrup, as well as the codeine, makes it a very addictive substance.

The sweet taste also means that many do not realise the danger of sizzurp, nor how much they have had. Just one serving can contain 25 times the recommended daily dose of cough syrup.

'This is a very dangerous drug, it can lead to seizures and essentially lead you to stop breathing,’ Dr. Robert Glatter of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York told Today.com.

‘The sweetness of the soda and candy combined with the drug itself makes people want to have this all day long.

‘They just don’t know how much they’ve had throughout the day and by then, it’s almost too late.’
