An 11-year-old schoolgirl who was clinically obese has lost 6st and is now set to compete as a swimmer in the Junior Olympic Games.

Just 14 months ago, Breanna Bond from Clovis, California, weighed 14st but has since overhauled her diet and embraced exercise.

Her size made her the victim of cruel taunts from school bullies and as she continued to pile on the pounds, her mother Heidi decided it was time to take action.

Breanna is now set to compete as a swimmer in the Junior Olympic Games after qualifying for the 500-yard freestyle swimming competition

Now, after ditching junk food and exercising regularly, Breanna weighs a healthy 8st.

And remarkably she has set her sights on an Olympic medal after qualifying for the 500-yard freestyle swimming competition at the Junior Olympic Games.

Her incredible transformation has also seen her became a successful tri-athlete and cheerleader.

She said: ‘I feel like I can move more in sports now and it’s a lot easier for me in cheerleading and cross country. I can just go faster.’

Breanna was just two years old when Heidi noticed her daughter was gaining weight faster than children her own age.

Even at a very young age, Breanna seemed to be gaining weight faster than her peers

With the help of her mother (pictured with Breanna, right) she has ditched the junk food and eats healthily

By the age of nine, she was so large she was being bullied at school.

Heidi said: ‘I thought maybe it could have been a thyroid issue, maybe some kind of genetic disorder.

‘Because it seemed like Breanna was gaining weight faster than her friends. I always thought it was medical.

Breanna hopes to inspire other children to get active and lose weight through a website started by her mother

‘But I hadn’t taken into consideration how much fat I would put in everything. We would make fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, and chicken fried steak.’

Breanna no longer eats junk food and doesn’t miss the fast food restaurants she used to frequent.

In fact her healthy new lifestyle proved so inspiring her own family now eat better and exercise more.

As well as starting a website to help other overweight children to loose weight, Breanna's journey has inspired her own family to make healthy changes

Heidi said: ‘One day we just decided to go for a family walk. Little by little we increased the number of days that we would do that.’

They have now launched a website, www.Breannabond.com, dedicated to Breanna’s weight-loss journey in a bid to inspire other children who are overweight.

Heidi explained: ‘It’s an inspirational site to help encourage other children everywhere to get motivated, to exercise and to lose the weight.’
