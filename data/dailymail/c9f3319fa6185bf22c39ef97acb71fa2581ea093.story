A pretty blonde thief casually slings a handbag over her shoulder as she brazenly breaks into a car - not knowing the vehicle is rigged with secret cameras.

The woman is one of dozens of thieves caught red-handed stealing computers and sat navs in a police sting operation.

West Midlands Police has released a video of criminals being caught in the act by their 'capture car', which they parked in Birmingham city centre.

Another clip shows a man pull his jacket sleeve over his hand before sneaking into an unlocked car and taking a laptop bag from the passenger seat.

Smile for the camera: This woman was caught stealing from West Midlands Police's 'capture car' in Birmingham city centre

The footage will be shown on BBC1 tomorrow morning in the latest 'Caught Red Handed'

Unknown to the thief, the computer was fitted with a tracking device which meant officers were able to catch the thief who was subsequently jailed for eight weeks.

PC Simon Williams, of West Midlands Police, said: 'It's not the wisest criminal move to break into a police car, but that's exactly what many unwitting criminals are doing.

'We're making thieves think twice before breaking into cars. We want them to fear that their actions may be caught on camera and provide us with irrefutable evidence.

'Thefts from motor vehicles are usually carried out in a matter of seconds with often no witnesses or CCTV footage.

'But the capture cars enable us to trap thieves red-handed with many being arrested at the scene or shortly after thanks to the camera images.'

The footage will be shown on BBC1 at 11am tomorrow in the latest 'Caught Red Handed' programme.

The show - which is presented by Dominic Littlewood - showcases the clever tactics West Midlands Police are trapping offenders and cutting crime.

PC Williams added: 'The capture cars are proving successful and helping us cut vehicle crime in the West Midlands.

'We've seen a year-on-year reduction in thefts from vehicles since they were introduced and so far this year it's down almost eight per cent with 1,325 fewer victims since April 2012 compared to the same period last year.'

Other West Midlands Police 'stings' featured include the use of covert cameras built into traffic lights to catch illegal street racers, forensic marking to trace metal thieves and 'capture houses' acting as bait to lure burglars.

The force also released a video of three bungling burglars who were captured on CCTV taking more than five minutes to break into a house - before one gets stuck trying to climb through a window and falls over.

The teenage thieves - all dressed in hoodies in an attempt to hide their faces - can be clearly seen in the CCTV footage struggling to gain access to the property, in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, in broad-daylight.

One of the burglars is then seen to fall over as he attempts to climb in through the window - and is forced to wait outside for his two accomplices.

Another of the suspects gives a clear view of his face as he stares directly at the camera during the broad-daylight break-in.

Smile! Despite wearing a hoodie, this thief's face can be clearly seen on CCTV footage released by police today

Despite their shambolic entry, the thieves spend another five minutes inside the house and steal a safe containing thousands of pounds worth of jewellery.

Police say the offenders then fled the scene in a blue or grey Audi estate.

Footage of the burglary was released by West Midlands Police today in a bid to trace the gang - who are believed to be in their late teens.

Investigating officer DC John Jinks, from Wolverhampton CID, said: 'First and foremost I want to hear from anyone who recognises the men in these images, you can quite clearly see the face of one of the individuals and I'm sure someone will know who he is.

Access: The first thief manages to get a window open and prepares to climb through it into the property

Success: After the first thief climbs through the window, his accomplices get ready to follow him

'As the footage shows this burglary took some time and someone may have seen the men in the area on the day of the break-in.

'I'd also like to hear from anyone who may have seen the blue or grey Audi fleeing the scene at lunchtime on 28 February or anyone who saw anything suspicious in the Pope Road area of the Scotlands on the same day.'

The group forced entry to a side door of the property using a screwdriver in Redhouse Road, Tettenhall, between 1.30pm and 2pm.

Anyone with information is asked to call Wolverhampton CID on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
