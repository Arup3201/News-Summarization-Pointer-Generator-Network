The Eiffel Tower, Tower Bridge, the Sydney Opera House and the Lincoln Memorial - we couldn't imagine our cities without them.

But what of the discarded designs that never made it off the drawing board? How different would our skylines have looked?

Vincze Miklos from iO9 has unearthed some incredible drawings of great architectural landmarks that failed to get commissioned.

A proposal for the Lincoln Memorial by John Russell Pope, 1912. With no classical tradition within the U.S. to draw from, Pope instead looked towards the Greek and Egyptians to create a  pyramid proposal for the Lincoln Memorial

One of the more unusual designs is a drawing put forward by architect John Russell Pope in 1912.

With no classical tradition to draw from in the U.S., he instead looked towards the Greek and Egyptians to create a pyramid proposal for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.

Some historians believe that Pope put forward the zany design because he wasn't a fan of the original site chosen for the Lincoln Memorial.

They believe it was his last-ditch effort to discourage decision-makers from using the location by briefly presenting his strange pyramid idea, before strongly pitching ideas for other sites in Washington.

Eighteen years earlier, a number of 
potential designs for Tower Bridge were published by The Engineer in 
1894 in a book written by J.E. Tuit.

A number of potential designs for Tower Bridge were published by The Engineer magazine in 1894

Among them were three by Joseph Bazalgette. He proposed a series of designs for a very high-level bridge that would have allowed shipping to pass beneath

All three of Bazalgette's designs were rejected as they would have required a huge spiral ramp on the bank of the Thames to allow traffic to flow down at a reasonable slope

The book, which will today set you back between £100-£150, reveals a number of other potential designs as well as building plans for the bridge and images of its construction.

Among the designs were three put forward by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, chief commissioner to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the architect of London’s great sewer.

All three, however, were rejected because they would have required a huge spiral ramp on the southern bank of the Thames to enable traffic to move down at a reasonable angle.

Another design by F.J Palmer had two moveable platforms at either end of the bridge with a roadway in place at all times, even when ships were passing through.

Not long after the Tower Bridge commission, architects 
in London started drawing up plans to rival and outdo the Eiffel Tower.

Recently uncovered 
documents revealed how an intense competition was held to find a design for 
what was to be called the Great Tower of London.

The winning entry was to be built in Wembley Park, North West London and was intended to be a centerpiece of a new funfair.

However the building of the ambitious 
octagonal structure hit a stumbling block as the project ran out of 
money after only completing the first floor.

These pictures show the amazing designs that were submitted by 68 talented architects that were published in a catalogue.

and Dunn, right, looks similar to the Eiffel Tower. The winners received a prize of 500 guineas and according to documents was
 215 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower

These pictures show the amazing designs that were submitted by 68 talented architects that were published in a catalogue. Some look like carbon copies of the Eiffel Tower itself, while others resemble bizarre structures of the future

In 1957, architect Anatol Kagan participated in the competition for the Sydney Opera House, which he prepared during a brief stay in that city.

While his entry was unplaced, his drawings were later displayed as part of an exhibition to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the competition.

Other designs that were never built include a Masonic temple complex created by Waddy B. Wood in 1922 and a drawing the U.S. Capitol with high dome by William Thornton in 1797.

This image was on display in the National Building Museum’s exhibition, Unbuilt Washington (2011-2012).

This proposed Masonic Temple Complex was created by Waddy B. Wood, 1922-24. The site of this complex was where the Washington Hilton stands today
