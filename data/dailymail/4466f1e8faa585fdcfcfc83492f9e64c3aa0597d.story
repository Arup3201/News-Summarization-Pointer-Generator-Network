Neo-nazi Beate Zschaepe  delivered a final snub to her alleged victims yesterday – turning her back on their lawyers and relatives as  she entered court for her mass  murder trial.

Then she sat impassively as the marathon case began with prosecution claims  of how she and her psychopathic lovers assassinated immigrants in a bid to build a Fourth Reich in Germany.

Zschaepe, 38, is in the dock with four members of the National Socialist Underground (NSU). It is alleged they believed random executions – nine businessmen and a policewoman over a 13-year period – would lead foreigners to quit Germany forever, leading to a ‘pure race’ like that championed by her idol Adolf Hitler.

Accused: The trial in Munich will focus on 38-year-old Zschaepe, who is charged with complicity in the murder of eight Turks, a Greek and a policewoman

Scrutiny: In a break with standard practice the court allowed Zschaepe's face to be filmed as she entered the court in a dark suit, her arms folded, before turning her back to the cameras

Spotlight: Hundreds of reporters queued outside the Munich courthouse in the hope of gaining one of the few available seats in the packed courtroom for the start of a trial scheduled to last for more than a year

A total of 84 court days have been 
earmarked for the trial but some observers are saying it could last more
 than two years, with hundreds of witnesses to be called.

Zschaepe, who has been branded the 
‘Nazi Bride’ by the German media, walked into court in a black trouser 
suit and a white blouse with her hair dyed chestnut brown and her arms 
folded.

She then turned her back contemptuously on the lawyers 
representing relatives of those she and her helpers allegedly killed, 
and began chatting with her legal team.

As she sat down, angry demonstrators 
were outside the courthouse in Munich waving placards calling for 
justice amid the tightest security for a post-war trial seen in Germany.

Start of proceedings: Jailed co-defendants arrive at the Munich courthouse, southern Germany today

Arrival: Semiya Simsek, left, and her brother 
Enver , children of NSU victim Enver Simsek arrive at court as policemen
 evacuate a young woman of Turkish origin, who tried to get access to 
the Munich courthouse

Tension: Police officers stand outside the Higher Regional Court amid protests outside

Anger: Demonstrators holding pictures of victims gather outside the court - the highest-profile neo-Nazi murder trial in Germany in decades opened amid tight security

Protestors: Police block protesters outside the courthouse - the case has caused anger among Turks in Germany

Scrum: Journalists and policemen surround Munich's mayor Christian Ude as he listens to two young women of Turkish origin, who try to get access to the courthouse

Hundreds of police held back a crowd 
shortly after the hearing began as two Turkish girls tried to storm the 
building shouting ‘Death, death, death to Fascists’. Some held up photos
 of the victims and one banner read, ‘Why were the authorities blind?’ 
Another said, ‘Hitler-child Zschaepe, you will pay for your crimes’.

Manholes were welded shut, airspace over the court building was closed and police sharpshooters took up positions on rooftops.

Zschaepe’s lawyers derailed the first 
day of proceedings with a motion seeking to dismiss the trial judge 
because he insists she and her cohorts are searched for weapons before 
they enter court while the police are not.

The next hearings were postponed to later this month.

Gang: The bodies of her alleged accomplices, Uwe Mundlos, 38, and Uwe Boenhardt, 34, were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide last year

When the case resumes it is expected 
to expose grievous police and intelligence failings in allowing the NSU 
cell – comprising Zschaepe and her two lovers – to allegedly operate for
 so long, especially as they were under covert surveillance for much of 
the time that the murders were under way.

There is a feeling in Germany that the
 authorities did not take the murders seriously because the victims were
 foreigners and that the country has been ‘blinded’ to the threat of 
violent neo-Nazism.

The cell imploded after a botched bank robbery in 
November 2011, 13 years after they went underground to live from the 
proceeds of similar heists across the country.

Her male accomplices, Uwe
 Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt, both died – Mundlos shot Boehnhardt before 
turning the gun on himself.

Plot: Beate Zschaepe and Uwe Boehnhardt. Uwe Mundlos, 38, and  Boenhardt, 34, were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide

Blown up: The NSU had been undetected until Zschaepe blew up her rented flat in eastern Germany a year ago and gave herself up to police

Zschaepe is charged with complicity in the murders of eight ethnic Turks, a Greek immigrant and a German policewoman.

She is also accused of involvement in 15 armed robberies, arson and attempted murder in two bomb attacks.

Her lawyers deny she was directly 
involved in murder. Zschaepe has remained silent during her 18 months in
 custody. She faces life in prison if convicted.

Her sidekicks on trial are Ralf 
Wohlleben, 38, and Carsten Schultze, 33, both accused of being 
accessories to murder in the killing of the nine men. Prosecutors allege
 they supplied the trio with the weapons used in the killings.

Andre Eminger, 33, is accused of being
 an accessory in two of the bank robberies and in the 2004 nail bombing 
in Cologne that injured 22 people. He has a tattoo ‘Die Jew Die’ on his 
stomach.

The fourth man, Holger Gerlach, 39, is accused of three counts of supporting a terrorist organisation.

Remembrance: A monument to commemorate the victims of the NSU terror group is pictured in Nuremberg
