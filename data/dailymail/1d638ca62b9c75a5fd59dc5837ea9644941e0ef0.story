It is definitely a unique way to get an office with a view.

California design firm Ideo has revealed three visions for the future or cars - all transparent.

They include a smart car that can turn its seats to form a living room, a delivery 'tube' that can drop off goods, and the moving office can can let you work from anywhere.

WorkOnWheels, a concept which could see mobile office driving around the city to turn parking lots and even beachfronts into mobile offices for firms. The firm says it hopes the vehicles will cut people's commute time.

The mobile office comes complete with a desk that can double as a meeting table. The firm says it can be driven to the beach for brainstorming sessions, or even linked toogether to form bigger spaces.

'As confidence grows in autonomous ways of delivering goods and autonomous driving becomes more mainstream, a third stage of automobility will come into existence,' Ideo says.

'It will involve inverse commutes, where working spaces come closer to where people live instead of commuters heading to pre-determined workplaces.

Food trucks, laundry, mobile dentistry, and other ad hoc services can pop up around a 'Work On Wheels' site, ready to serve people working there, the firm believes.

The designers predict that more companies will start using mobile offices that can make use of parking spaces or other temporarily vacant space in crowded cities, such as using a baseball stadium lot in the off season.

At the end of the day, the office would head back to a garage to recharge.

The firm also says delivery trucks are set for major changes - and have even given them a name, Cody.

'As we look ahead, we see self-driving delivery trucks— we call them 21st-Century mules— delivering everything from your new jeans to a hot lunch, almost instantly,' they says.

'After receiving notification that 'Cody' has arrived, you'll simply walk to the curb, do a biometric scan, and receive your package. No tips required.'

The tubular transparent trucks would come on demand, so if you need a dress or lunch delivered, you could get it almost instantly. 

A robot in the back would sort and resort packages as the route changes throughout the day. 

The truck would serve as a drop-off spot for packages when it's parked. 

By optimizing routes and delivering during off-peak hours, the trucks could reduce traffic and help save over $100 billion in gas costs in the U.S, the firm says.

The firm has also given the car a makeover.

Self-driving cars, which are coming in the next few years, will be common in a decade or two, it says.

'As we move from struggling with today’s inefficient relationship between cars and infrastructure to one empowered by automobility, new capacities and better use of our existing resources will emerge. 

'Daily commutes will improve in ways that allow us to accomplish so much more, making the slow seem fast. 

Ideo's concept is a self driving vehicle where seats can be turned around, making the centre console a desk or, for evening event, even a bar.

It will also use smart software to allow more cars to fit on the road, by allowing them to drive closer together.
