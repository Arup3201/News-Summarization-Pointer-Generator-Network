Ed Miliband today came under pressure from his own MPs to lurch left in the wake of the victory for an anti-austerity party in Greece. 

Senior Labour politicians hailed the 'exciting' victory for the left and demanded an end to 'savage cuts', piling pressure on Ed Miliband to oppose more spending cuts.

And Green MEPs said the win by the left-wing Syriza party result  'marks the beginnings of ordinary people standing up to a discredited economic model'.

But Tory Chancellor George Osborne warned against 'returning to economic chaos', insisting a change in direction would lead to higher unemployment.

Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras swept to victory overnight on a promise to renegotiate Greece's €240billion (£179bn) international bailout deal.

He has also pledged to reverse many of the reforms that EU creditors demanded in exchange for keeping Greece financially afloat since 2010.

That has placed the country on a collision course with Germany over its massive bailout deal, with Angela Merkel effectively saying the new Greek government can forget any kind of debt relief.

The 40-year-old was sworn in this afternoon, making him the youngest Greek Prime Minister for more than 150 years. 

With 101 days until the general election in the UK, the result has been hailed by left-wing parties in who hope it will bolster their call to reverse the efforts to tackle nation's deficit.

Reacting to the result today, Mr Miliband sought to distance himself from events in Greece: 'Just like our elections are a matter for the people of this country, so who the Greek people elect is a decision for them.

'It is the responsibility of the British government to work with the elected government of Greece for the good of Britain and Europe and not to play politics.

'And it is up to each country to choose its own path on how to deal with the economic and social challenges they face.

'We have set out our path for Britain: to make sure our country is fairer and more prosperous and balance the books.'

But veteran leftwing Labour MP John McDonnell said the Syriza 'points the way to ending the era of austerity across Europe'.

He added: 'Nobody should underestimate the anger and the demand for change here.' 

Former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain, a close ally of Ed Miliband, declared: 'Fantastic Syriza win: austerity does not work for Greece, for Tory/Lib Dem UK, nor for EU; we all need investment in growth not savage cuts.'

Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, said he was 'delighted' with the result in Greece

More than a dozen Labour MPs have called on Ed Miliband to lurch left, in the wake of the election victory secured by Syriza in Greece.

A letter signed by 16 MPs calls for an end to 'prolonged austerity', nationalisation of the railways and  a return to collective bargaining and employment rights in the workplace.

Labour MP Michael Meacher  told LabourList: 'Jobs and growth are vitally needed rather than prolonged austerity as the best means both to cut the deficit fastest and to give hope to our people. 

'Public ownership is urgently needed to reverse failed privatisations, and the railways should lead the way to a new perspective of the crucial role of the public sector. 

'And an enhanced role for the trade unions is strongly needed both to promote economic partnership in our workplaces and to reverse the extreme inequality now so badly disfiguring our society'.

Among the MPs who have backed the letter are Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Chris Williamson, Katy Clark and Linda Riordan. 

Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, said he was 'delighted' with the result in Greece, adding: 'Austerity con that's increased poverty and made super-rich even richer has been dealt a severe blow.'

George Aylett, Labour candidate in South West Wiltshire, said austerity does not work and was 'punishing the poor for the mistakes made by the rich'.

Harry Leslie Smith, wrote on Twitter: 'With Syriza election win Greece has lit the way for the rest of Europe's battle against neo con austerity.' 

Louise Haigh, a Labour candidate in Sheffield Heeley, said:' 'A major victory for the left and in fight against austerity, very exciting.' 

The Green party, which has called for an end to austerity, predicted the Greek result would be repeated in the UK 

Green MP Caroline Lucas said she had been 'inspired' by the 'huge vote' for Syriza.

'Now EU must listen to people & economists & respond with debt forgivenesss & support,' she wrote on Twitter. 

Green MEPs Scott Cato and Keith Taylor also called for an anti-austerity revolution in Britain.

'Greens share the view of the new government that austerity is a failed model which has piled misery on the poorest while making the wealthiest even richer,' they said in a statement.

They added: 'This result shows that challenging business as usual politics can win the support of the people. 

'In the UK we are witnessing a Green Surge, in no small part due to our anti-austerity agenda, and we hope the Greek election result marks the beginnings of ordinary people standing up to a discredited economic model and failing Governments across Europe.'

The Green party manifesto promises policy to give everyone in the country a 'basic citizen's income' of £72 a week regardless of wealth - at a staggering cost to the country of £280billion. 

The party also backs zero economic growth and falling levels of personal consumption and wealth as a way of protecting the environment.

Prime Minister David Cameron warned the result will 'increase economic across Europe' and vowed to stick to his austerity programme

But the UK government insisted that diverting from the plan to reduce spending cuts would lead to economic chaos.

Mr Osborne said relying on spending more money to get out of difficulties was a 'panacea, false hope'.

'Ultimately, if you take at face value all the things that the new Greek government has promised, including new big increases in public expenditure, I think that is going to be very difficult to deliver and incompatible with what the eurozone currently demands of its members,' he said.

'But I hope that both sides now act responsibly.

'Everyone has in the past looked over the precipice of Greek exit from the euro and pulled back. It is certainly in the UK's interest that we have stability, that we have proper dialogue here between members of the euro.

'But ultimately what the UK needs is a strong partner, and the institutions of the eurozone are not working well enough for the people of Europe, and that has an impact on us.'

Conservative MP Julian Smith MP said: 'Syriza will increase economic uncertainty across Europe, Ed Miliband wants to do exactly the same thing in the UK.

'Britain currently has a long-term economic plan that works wile Ed Miliband offers only chaos and confusion.

'In fact the views of many of Labour MPs wouldn't be out of place in Syriza.

'One thing that's certain is Ed Miliband is a weak leader who isn't respected by his own MPs.'
