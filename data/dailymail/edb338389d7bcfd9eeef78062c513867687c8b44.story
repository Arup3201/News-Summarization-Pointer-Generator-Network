Four officers were arrested after they shot a man dead when he allegedly armed himself with a knife and took a delicatessen manager hostage.

Brendan John Lindsay, 38, entered The Lunch Club in Carlisle, Perth and grabbed a knife from behind the counter as he threatened to kill Sheila Tran, 37,  on Saturday morning.

Tran  suffered stab wounds to her neck and back and was accidentally shot twice in the leg during the incident while Lindsay was shot dead by officers at the scene.

But WA Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan said he regrets the officers were detained for several hours after being arrested under the Criminal Investigations Act.

Footage has revealed the shocking moment Brendan John Lindsay held a knife to a woman known as Sheila's throat

He said questioning the officers was part of the internal investigation, but it would have been more appropriate to do so under police regulations.

He also said it was unacceptable that the officers had to stay at the scene for some time and that one was not allowed to wash blood from his hands after trying to resuscitate Mr Lindsay because of a delay in the forensic testing.

Ms Tran remains at Royal Perth Hospital with serious injuries. 

Mr O'Callaghan said he had apologised to the officers, who had not complained about their treatment.

WA Police Union president George Tilbury said it was unnecessary to treat the officers like 'criminals' after they experienced the trauma of taking a life to save a life.

Mr Tilbury said Mr O'Callaghan needed to ensure such matters were never handled the same way again as it had upset "every police officer in the state".

'We need to get to the bottom of who made the decision. I don't blame the officers at the scene but someone in the professional standards portfolio has given the directive,' Mr Tilbury said.

'One way or another, heads need to roll.'

WA Today reports that officers from across the state are 'disgusted' by the arrest of officers involved in the fatal shooting and are threatening to go on strike.

WA Premier Colin Barnett agreed the officers should not have been arrested and it was appropriate Mr O'Callaghan had apologised.

Mr O'Callaghan said he was happy to work with the union to develop improved guidelines for police shootings, which were rare in WA.

He said the incident would be pulled apart "shot by shot" in the Coroner's Court.

'There were a lot of shots fired in this,' he said.

'Every one of those ... will have to be justified.'

He said nothing suggested the officers hadn't acted responsibly, 'so I've been supporting the officers all the way through this'.

Lindsay was shot dead by police after the threatened to kill Sheila, and started stabbing her

Lindsay had been having an argument with his father, according to The West Australian, which Sheila has tried to intervene in.

Shocking footage captured by a witness and aired by Nine News shows the man holding his hostage tightly in a headlock with the knife close to her head.

An exchange between him and police can be heard, with one officer trying to negotiate with Lindsay saying 'Tell me what you want and I'll try and do it for you'.

He grabbed the knife from behind the counter of the deli Sheila managed and dragged her outside

Officers are said to have fired around eight shots at the man  

Lindsay was screaming 'Get back! Get back!' at the officers while Sheila yelled 'Let me go! Let me go, please!' 

Officers were forced to shoot him when he began stabbing his victim.

Witnesses described the chaos and terror of the scene, describing how Lindsay had threatened to cut the woman's throat.

'While I was in there this chap came from the front, bolted into the shop, grabbed knives then grabbed the boss and took her outside ... and threatened her, local Donald McCaw told the ABC.

The woman was rushed to hospital with stab wounds to her neck and a bullet wound to the leg

The incident took play the The Lunch Club delicatessan in Carlisle, Perth

'Then he took her outside and they were trying to quieten him down, trying to stop her doing anything, any harm,' he said.

'He said I'll cut her throat, and everyone was around and they tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't.'

Police arrived at the scene and shot at the man, firing between six and eight shots. 

Mr McCaw said 'They [the police] were lucky to get shots in I think.'
