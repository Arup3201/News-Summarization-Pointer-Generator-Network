The diary of 'gifted' ballerina Tallulah Wilson, who threw herself in front of a train, has been described by police as 'dark and sad'

A ‘beautiful’ teenage ballerina repeatedly scrawled ‘fat’, ‘ugly’ and ‘worthless’ in her diary before throwing herself in front of a train, an inquest heard yesterday.

Tallulah Wilson’s obsession with her appearance – and her mistaken belief that she was overweight – was fuelled through people she met on social networking websites, a jury was told.

The coroner described two sides to the 15-year-old – one a ‘confident, lively, engaged, lovely looking girl’ who was a gifted dancer, the other a troubled teenager who suffered from self-loathing and was wrongly convinced she was ‘extremely unattractive.’

She wrote dozens of messages about her depression and posted images of her self-inflicted injuries on photo-sharing website Tumblr, where internet users encouraged her to harm herself and share images of it, the inquest heard.

Tallulah, who lived with her family in a £1million house in West Hampstead, North London, was found dead at St Pancras station in October 2012, a few hours after her mother saw her off to a dance class.

DS Adrian Naylor of the British Transport Police, who investigated the death, said that diaries found at her home showed ‘disturbing writing relating to self-loathing and self-harm’.  ‘It is pretty dark, pretty sad and pretty bleak,’ he said. ‘She had written “I am fat” repeatedly, over and over again’.

On one page she wrote in large black-inked letters, ‘ugly’.

Another page said, ‘what am I? You are nothing’ and repeated the word ‘worthless’.

The court has heard that Tallulah had become so obsessed by the internet that she had created a fantasy cocaine-taking character in order to escape reality.

The teenager had gained 18,000 
followers on sites such as Twitter and Tumblr after posting about 
drinking and taking cocaine, and uploading pictures of herself with cuts
 she had made. She regularly posted messages such as ‘I will never be 
beautiful and skinny’.

DS Naylor said there were a number of issues rather than one ‘specific trigger’ that may have led to her death.

He said: ‘It could be a combination of
 what appears to be relationship breakdowns with people on the internet,
 concern about self-appearance and basically engaging with like-minded 
people who seem to feed that obsession. It appeared from the diary that 
Tallulah sadly had very low self-esteem.’

Mary
 Hassell, senior coroner for inner London north, told the jury a 
photograph of Tallullah showed her to be a ‘very beautiful, lovely 
looking young woman’.

Her 
dance teacher, Peter Laycock, told the inquest that Tallulah was his 
most confident pupil and a talented ballerina when she began her dance 
GCSE course in January 2012.

‘She began as very outgoing and well-liked, she was the leader of the group’, he said.

‘Because
 Tallulah was naturally very gifted at dance she also had a brilliant 
sense of humour and in many ways she was the most able member of the 
group.’

He said she did 
appear to lose some of her ‘spark’ later in the year but appeared to 
have improved again, producing some ‘brilliant work’ just a week before 
her death.

The inquest heard
 she had been bullied at St Marylebone school in St Pancras, which she 
attended until summer of 2012 when she moved to St Margaret’s School in 
Hampstead.

A teacher responsible for pupil welfare at St Marylebone said Tallulah never complained to staff about being bullied.

Lindsay
 Ancock said: ‘If she was, she certainly never used the word, and we 
were not aware of it. ‘It was always her mother who used the word 
“bullied”.’

The inquest continues.
