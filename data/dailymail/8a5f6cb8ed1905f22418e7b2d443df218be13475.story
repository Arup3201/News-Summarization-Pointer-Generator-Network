Since the Arab Spring in 2011, Yemenis have endured intermittent fighting, attempted coups and increasing violence but now, with Houthi militiamen advancing on the beleaguered forces of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi in the second city of Aden, things look increasingly bleak.

With the capital Sana'a also in the hands of the Iran-backed rebels, women and children are now on the front line of a conflict that, last night alone, saw an estimated 40 people perish after Saudi war planes apparently bombed a refugee camp.

Now a haunting new set of photos has shed light on what Yemen stands to lose, including a Bedouin minority that has lived in Yemen - and neigbouring countries such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia - for thousands of years.

Under threat: These women were photographed in Amran, a town that fell to the Houthis last summer and is now being targeted with air strikes

Front line: These girls live in Shaharah, a village in Houthi controlled territory close to the Saudi Arabian border

Fighting: This little girl was photographed close to the city of Taiz which fell to the Houthi militia yesterday

The pictures, which were taken by French photographer Eric Lafforgue, show the country's women and children going about their daily lives, whether chatting in the market or having their nails hennaed.

But more than ever, their future looks uncertain with Saudi Arabian troops massing on the border, Iran refusing to back down and nightly air strikes conducted by planes from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and even Sudan.

So far, most have been confined to the capital with Sa'naa's international airport among the targets hit last night, along with an army camp in Saadeh and the Red Sea port of Hudaida.

'There were huge blazes in the mountains outside Sanaa. It looks like they hit a missile depot and it was on fire for half an hour or so. Then there was anti-aircraft fire until dawn,' a Sanaa resident said. 

Nevertheless, even before the Houthi advance began, life wasn't particularly easy for the women of Yemen. One third of girls are married off before the age of 18 according to UNICEF, with a handful marrying aged nine or 10.

'Many activists campaign for a minimum age for marriage but enforcing that in the remoter areas is difficult,' explains Lafforgue, a frequent visitor to Yemen.

Dangerous: Shaharah is currently in rebel hands but for the women who live there, little has changed so far

Restricted: For many women, life in Yemen is restrictive. Here, a woman is seen shopping accompanied by two male family members

Changing times: For these women, who live in the Yemeni capital, life has become increasingly dangerous since the 2011 Arab Spring

Historic: These women live in  historic Al Hajjarah, a town built by the Sulayhid dynasty in the 12th century. It was once popular with tourists

'Yemen is a country where female genital mutilation (FGM) remains an issue, even though it has been officially outlawed. Many girls miss out on education as well.' 

Hadi's government had set a target of 90 per cent of girls in education by the end of 2015 but with the Houthis and soldiers loyal to ousted president Ali Abdullah Saleh now in control of most of the country, it's a target that is unlikely to be hit. 

'Convincing parents of the benefits of sending their daughters to school is difficult,' adds Lafforgue. 'Many families in rural areas think it is a waste of money to educate a girl.

'Instead, they expect them to stay at home and cook or collect firewood and water. When they marry, the girls are expected do much the same.'

Despite strict rules that often mean that the only part of a Yemeni woman visible are a pair of hennaed hands, Lafforgue says the same rules are not applied to foreign women who are regarded as 'a third sex' in Yemen.

'They don't have to wear a veil or anything like that, although it is appreciated in some places,' he says.'They are allowed to do everything, including eating and speaking with men.

'When I walked through Sa'naa with a girl wearing trousers, many Yemeni men came up to me and asked: "Is it a man or a woman?"' Trousers, unless with a long robe, are not supposed to be worn by women.' 

Some do have more freedom, however, among them the bare-faced ladies of Taiz and Jebel Saber close to Aden. But with both towns falling to the Houthis yesterday, their days of being allowed to do as they please could be numbered.

Traditional: Women living in Shaharah. Because the village is so remote, fetching water means a daily trek to a well miles from home

Making a living: A lady carries water in a village just outside Al Hudaydah while another battles a flooded wadi in Tihamah

Scorching: Women living in the huge Hadhramaut province in central Yemen often wear tall hats as extra protection from the sun

Decorative: The only adornment visible on most Yemeni women is a pair of hennaed hands

Education: Many village women such as this one are not educated because their families see it as a waste of time, according to Lafforgue 

The current round of fighting in Yemen has pitted government forces led by President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi against an Iran-backed rebel force made up of Houthis and soldiers supporting former leader Ali Abdullah Saleh who was ousted in 2012.

Supporting President Hadi is an Arab coalition led by  Saudi Arabia and including Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Sudan among others.

The Houthis are from a Yemeni Shi'ite sect and are allied to Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. The Saudis and other Sunni Muslim countries in the region fear the advance of the Houthis will ultimately threaten the world's top oil exporter. 

Much of the fighting is focused on the port city of Aden where President Hadi is holed up amid bloody clashes with Houthi forces. Aden is Hadi's last stronghold in Yemen and remains besieged despite a fifth day of  air strikes aimed at checking the Houthi advance.

The Saudi air strikes, part of an operation named Decisive Storm, may herald a full-blown invasion, with troops already massing on the Yemeni border. 

However, Reuters reports that US officials say that Saudi Arabia is reluctant to take the next step if at all possible. 

Different life: Not all Yemeni women live restricted lives. In Jebel Saber in Taiz, close to Aden, women have similar powers to men

Overrun: Residents of Taiz such as this women have now been overwhelmed by Houthi rebels who advanced into the city yesterday

Advance: Soldiers from Yemeni units loyal to ousted president Ali Abdullah Saleh pictured on the outskirts of Taiz

Frightening: Rebels in the Yemeni capital Sa'naa attempt to hold off a Saudi air strike using anti-aircraft weapons
