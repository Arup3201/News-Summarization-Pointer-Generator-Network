As a centre back, Tottenham new-boy Federico Fazio is used to saving goals. But there was a time when the Argentine thought he’d be saving lives.

‘I was a medical student for about 18 months in Argentina,’ revealed the 27-year-old. ‘I was 18 at the time, but then I went to play for Sevilla when I was 19.

‘Do I regret the decision of giving up medicine? No. It has been amazing to play in the best leagues in the world.

‘But I was only at medical school for a year, so I won’t be able to help our injured players!’

Leaving Sevilla, where he spent eight years, wasn’t an easy decision for Fazio to make.

Nevertheless, he says joining compatriot Mauricio Pochettino’s White Hart Lane revolution was a chance he couldn’t turn down.

‘I was there for eight years and I was an idol for the fans there,’ said Fazio. ‘I was only going to leave for a good option. So when Tottenham came in for me it was a very good option.

‘I wanted to try another league and a team like Spurs — one of the best teams in the world.’
