A teenage victim of Dr Myles Bradbury has told of how the paedophile abused him up to 50 times while his parents sat just meters away

A teenage victim of Dr Myles Bradbury has spoken of the abuse he suffered at the hands of the paedophile NHS doctor and how it occurred as his parents sat just yards away.

The victim said the abuse began when he was a 13-year-old patient of Bradbury, and he was abused up to 50 times while being treated for a rare blood disorder. The attacks began in 2008 at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

While behind an examination curtain, and with his parents nearby in the same room, the teenager said the doctor sexually assaulted him.

The boy's parents only learned of the abuse when police sent letters to up to 800 possible victims.

Earlier this week, cancer specialist Bradbury admitted seven counts of sexual assault and 12 of engaging in sexual activity with a child.

The victim, who is now a 19-year-old college student, said because Bradbury was a doctor he 'automatically' trusted him.

But while carrying out a full body examination he said the doctor touched him.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'Because he was a doctor I thought it was completely normal and he did it nearly every time I saw him.'

The victim said he was 'shocked' by the abuse because Bradbury had come across as 'such a nice guy'.

During every monthly appointment, the victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said Bradbury would examine him for between five to 10 minutes. At the time he thought nothing of it.

The boy switched hospitals in January this year and it was at that stage that his family started to become aware of what had taken place. The boy reported that the examinations by his new doctor didn't involve his 'privates'.

When the family then received a letter from the police, the abuse became clear.

The boy's father said: 'I question myself, thinking 'why didn't I see what was going on?'

'But I also ask myself 'why didn't the NHS pick up on it?'''

The victim said Bradbury began abusing him in 2008 at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge

The victim said he believes the NHS should have monitored the frequency of his appointments with Bradbury. His family are now considering taking legal action against the NHS.

The Trust which employed the 41-year-old told the Mirror that Bradbury's 'cold and calculating' nature meant catching him was difficult.

Bradbury was suspended as soon as concerns were raised, a Cambridge University Hospitals Trust spokesman said.

Bradbury, of Herringswell, Suffolk, admitted seven counts of sexual assault and 12 of engaging in sexual activity with a child on Monday.

He also admitted three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

The hearing was told Bradbury filmed at least one of his 18 known victims, who were aged between eight and 17.

He is awaiting sentencing.

Meanwhile, Birmingham Children's Hospital has set up a helpline for up to 250 youngpatients treated by Bradbury, who worked there as a registrar and consultant from 2004 to 2008.

Chief nurse Michelle McLoughlin said staff were stunned and had moved swiftly to support youngsters treated by Bradbury during his time in the Midlands.

She said: 'The safety of the children and young people we care for is our top priority and we were deeply shocked to learn of the charges brought against Dr Bradbury.

'As soon as we were alerted to these allegations in July we contacted the children he treated and their families to offer our support and advice through a helpline. We continue to encourage anyone with a concern to contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Service.'

A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said the force was working with the hospital to respondto any concerns from members of the public.
