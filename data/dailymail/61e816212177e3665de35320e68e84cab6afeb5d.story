Britain will bring home 4,000 troops from Afghanistan next year under plans to speed up the pace of British withdrawal.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond revealed the mass pullout, the first senior minister to put a concrete number on the scale of the drawdown.

David Cameron has previously announced that British combat operations in Afghanistan will be over by the end of 2014.

But Mr Hammond said commanders have advised the government that Afghan forces will be able to cope if nearly half of the UK's 9,000-strong force in Helmand province pulls out next year.

Initial plans would have seen the vast bulk of British troops withdraw in 2014, but commanders now consider that they can move faster in 2013.

Army chiefs have also come under pressure from Chancellor George Osborne, who confronted commanders at a recent National Security Council meeting, demanding to know why they couldn't pull all British troops out of Afghanistan now.

The Treasury is keen to save money to help reduce the deficit and operations in Afghanistan have already cost in excess of £17 billion on top of the core defence budget.

Britain currently has 9,500 military personnel on the ground, a figure which will be cut to 9,000 by the end of this year.

Mr Hammond said reductions next year would be dramatically bigger: 'Following my last visit to Afghanistan, I detect a change in mood among the senior ISAF commanders, that it will now be possible to have a significant reduction in force numbers by the end of next year, after the next fighting season.

'That is because of the evidence, this year, that as the US has withdrawn its surge, the Afghans have in fact stepped up to the plate and taken over those positions.

'I would expect it to be significant. Which means thousands not hundreds but I would not expect it to be the majority of our forces.'

Asked, by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether that meant around 4,000 troops would be brought back, Mr Hammond nodded and said: 'Something [like that].

'By the beginning of 2013, we'll have 9,000 troops there and by the end of 2014 we'll have virtually none. I would expect there to be a significant step at the end of 2013.'

The ability of the Afghan forces to take on the Taliban has been questioned as a result of a series of 'green on blue' incidents which have seen Taliban sympathisers infiltrate the local security forces and murder British soldiers.

But Mr Hammond said the Afghan Army has shown that it will be able to contain the Taliban once British and American troops leave.

'In two of the three districts that we, the UK, are responsible for, in Nadi Ali and Lashkhar Gah, the Afghans are doing all the day-to day security work already.

'Transition is well advanced in those areas. 'Our forces are mainly in the main operating bases, going out occasionally to support them. But by and large the Afghans already, two years ahead are in control of security.'

The Defence Secretary confirmed that the Chancellor questioned whether troops could be withdrawn now, but he said Mr Osborne was simply being provocative.

'The Chancellor's style is quite properly to challenge received wisdom,' he said. 'I think he was asking us to justify our current plan by putting it to us that there is an alternative, we could just come out now. And we take that challenge.'

The National Security Council is expected to meet again in December to discuss options for the Afghan force, with a decision likely before February.

Some 433 British service personnel have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 operation that toppled the Taliban.
