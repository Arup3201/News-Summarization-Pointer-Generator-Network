A mother-of-13 who allegedly offered a friend nicknamed 'Mafia Mike' $10,000 to murder her husband in a staged hunting accident has been indicted.

Wendy Farley, 46, was indicted by a grand jury on Monday at court in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine.

Mrs Farley was formally charged with felony criminal solicitation for planning to have a friend murder her husband of 30 years and make it look like an accident so she could be free of his strictness and obsession with cleanliness, authorities said.

Farley is expected to return to court today. She remains at Piscataquis County Jail where she has been held since last September.

Farley, a farmer's wife from Brownville, was arrested last year over the alleged murder-for-hire scheme of her husband Luther 'Rusty' Farley.

Investigators had
received a tip from a man identified as Michael 
‘Mafia Mike’ Anderson, of Milo, who told them that Farley contacted him 
and offered between $3,000 and $10,000 in cash for killing her husband.

Officials
then set up a wiretap operation in order to record the
conversations between the would-be hit man-turned-informant and the 
suspect.

In the secret recording made by Anderson,
who owns a local taxi company, Farley could be heard saying that she 
wanted her husband shot dead with a standard, .30-30 hunting rifle, the 
affidavit stated.

The 46-year-old women went on to clarify 
that she wanted 'nothing fancy, nothing stupid, nothing traceable,' documents stated.

Suspect: Farley, 46, was charged with trying to hire a hit man to kill her husband and father of her 13 children

'A straight hit, that's what I want,' the woman was allegedly recorded telling her acquaintance. 'One shot - drop him.'

When Anderson inquired why she wanted her
husband dead, she allegedly replied that while her spouse had never 
physically abused her or their children, his strictness has been 
oppressive to the point that some of their adult children were forced to
leave the farm.

'He's out, he's gone, I'm free,' Farley was quoted. 'Kids can grow up unafraid to be kids.'

Farley,
who has been described by friends and neighbors as a good wife and 
mother, admitted to police that she had cheated on her husband with 
other men and used the Internet to research ways to poison him.    

District
Court Judge Kevin Stitham ordered the woman held on $10,000 cash bail. 
Farley is banned from having any contact with her husband or Anderson, 
but she is permitted to see her children. Visits with her children who are minors are under supervision.

Farley's friend Merry Burton was 
shocked by the murder-for-hire allegations. She described the 
46-year-old suspect as a bright, joyful woman who liked to sing and play
guitar at open-mic nights.

'She was home-schooling her kids, she is a very good mom and is one of the hardest workers I know,' Burton said.

Informant: Farley allegedly approached Michael Anderson, right, about having her husband killed, but he tipped off police about the plot and help them set up a wiretap

'I only have good to say about her. I can't imagine any of this happening. There’s got to be more to the story,' she added.

The
friend went on to say that Farley never discussed her marriage. Some 
years ago, the mother of 13 stopped having babies and started losing 
weight, 'sort of like a flower emerging,' Burton said.

'She has been a brood mare for 30 years. It is about time she was doing something for herself,' Burton said.

Luther 'Rusty' Farley was not in court on Thursday, but according to the affidavit, he was deeply disturbed upon learning of his wife's alleged plot on his life and her extramarital affairs.

He staggered when told about the allegations, and a police officer who came to arrest his wife had to steady the man.

At one point, Mr Farley said he wanted
to see his wife to forgive her, explaining that while he had never hit 
her, he moved out temporarily about a month ago following an argument, 
the affidavit states, but the couple have since reconciled. 

Farley
told police repeatedly that ‘he could think of no reason why his wife 
had tried to have him killed’ except that 'he was very particular about 
the order and cleanliness of the house and stated that about once a year
he would get very angry because it would eat at him that she was so 
messy'.

Wendy Farley, however, said she found her husband demeaning.

‘If you could imagine for 29 years 
being told you were not good enough. … I finally snapped,’she told 
police.

Prospectors, however, said that during 
interviews with Farley, the woman appeared stoic and unemotional, 
creating the impression that she is not the kind of person who would 
suddenly lose her cool.
