Reader: Joanna Trollops believes being able to read should be a given, not a privilege

As leading author Joanna Trollope helps the Duchess of Cornwall launch the Children’s Reading Fund, she argues that illiteracy is probably the worst affliction that can befall a child other than abuse.

They aim to raise £2 million to make access to books a right – not a luxury.

Most of us have a nostalgic picture of the ideal bedtime story session – the clean, drowsy children, safe within the circle of a reading parent’s arm, a picture book, a comforting adult voice, the seductive fascination of narrative.

But, sadly, that idyllic picture – even if it ever universally existed  – is no longer the case.

Even if there is time, in modern families with two working parents, for such an idealised ritual, the shocking fact is that hundreds of thousands of children couldn’t take part in a bedtime story session – because they can’t read well enough, or worse, at all.

For those of us who have read comfortably and easily from a young age, this is an appalling state of affairs – especially in this apparently sophisticated age.

I suppose – and I bet I am far from alone – I have always taken reading for granted.

From those early years with a torch under the bedclothes – Tess Of The D’Urbervilles and Jane Eyre all night long when I was about 13 – to right now, when I never go anywhere without something to read, and regard it as being as natural and necessary as breathing.

It isn’t just that reading enables me to do my job – writing novels – but it also means that I can travel, shop, drive, communicate, enlighten and amuse myself, be alone, learn and develop.

Those gifts, vital to a mentally healthy and satisfying life, are exactly what too many children growing up in care or in households without books are being deprived of.

And, more tragically, the awareness of what reading and narrative mean to an even halfway good life.

You could say that my children and grandchildren were privileged, growing up as they did and do in houses full of books with parents who actively encourage reading and set an example by constantly reading themselves.

Indeed, I read to my grandchildren now out of their parents’ old books, held together by crackly strips of ancient Sellotape – Richard Scarry and Tove Jansson are particular favourites – but my point is that such a situation should not be one of privilege.

Invaluable: Trollope says we must learn to love books when young

It should be the norm. Reading, for every child in this supposedly civilised country, should be an absolute given.

There is a horrible statistic. I’m going to give it to you because it illustrates the problem so vividly. It is this.

If you are a child in care, or even being fostered, in the UK in 2013, you have a greater chance of ending up in prison than in further education.

And so much of that frightening danger is attributable to illiteracy. Children being moved from household to household and institution to institution never get the consistency of attention to learn to read.

Too often, they are in communities where there is no place for books, no time to be taught and helped to read.

They have no opportunity to discover the infinite comfort and companionship of books and stories, let alone the chances in life that being able to read gives you – and which not being able to read shuts you out of, for ever.

I don’t think it’s at all helpful to blame anyone. This situation has arisen, as so much of modern life has arisen, from people reacting to the way things are, the way things have become.

But that doesn’t mean that we should accept, for a nanosecond, that illiteracy is just one of those things. It is probably the worst affliction that can befall a deprived modern child, after actual abuse.

Are we proud to live in a society where nearly a quarter of our 16-year- olds have a reading age of nine?

It isn’t just their inevitably diminished lives that matter, but the effect on all the thousands of other people whom their lives and reduced capacities will impact on, in their lifetimes. To help this vital cause is to insure for a better future for countless people.

So when you next think that you are too busy – or too distracted by the pressures of our modern obsession with perpetual communication – to give time to helping your child to read, or to read with one who needs encouragement to persist, or even just wants a reading companion, think again.

What would your life be like if you couldn’t read? Well – it IS like that. For hundreds and thousands of our children. Right now. And it needn’t be.

The Children’s Reading Fund is specifically targeting children in care and children in poverty. There can be no better way out of these miserable situations than giving these children the best possible tool to help themselves.

And being able to read is that tool. Not a luxury, not a privilege, but a basic human right. Wouldn’t you say?
