One of Britain's most respected car designers has given the classic Jaguar Mark 2 a 21st-century makeover.

Ian Callum, who is the design director at Jaguar and the brain behind cars like the Aston Martin DB9, had always wanted one of the sought-after models and bought one just over two years ago with the hope of transforming it.

The 1962 saloon, like the one driven by Inspector Morse, was re-engineered by Classic Motor Cars in Shropshire where a team of mechanics brought it up to speed both inside and out.

Ian Callum, the design director at Jaguar, has given the manufacturers classic 1952 Mark 2 saloon a 21-century makeover, both inside and out

Mr Callum bought a Mark 2 Jaguar just over two years ago and worked with Classic Motor Cars in Shropshire to make it faster and more modern

While it was always a beautiful car, Mr Callum said  it could be 'even more exciting in shape and performance'

The exterior of the vehicle was dressed-up with new front and rear bumpers. The wings were also widened, the chrome moldings were removed, the lights were adjusted, and the exhaust was centrally-mounted.

Underneath the bonnet, the car was given a power-injection, with an uprated 4.3-litre straight-six engine which delivers 275bhp.

The car now has a five-speed manual gearbox, unique independent rear suspension and upgraded front brakes.

And inside the car now boasts a Scottish leather interior and all the high-tech gadgets of a modern machine -   a DVD player, reversing camera and iPhone connector.

The project took 18 months to complete, with the now, not-so-classic, car being unveiled this week.

Mr Callum, who is behind the current Jaguar F-Type, described the result as a 'a very personal statement'.

While he said the Mark 2 was always a 'beautiful car' it could be 'even more exciting in shape and performance'.

Mr Callum said: 'Whilst maintaining the purity of the car's form, I wanted to add a number of modern twists to the design. Simplification and clarity was my objective.

The Jaguar has four louvres on the side of the car to 'add that sense of power and something different'

Mr Callum said while he wanted to mantain the purity of the car's form, he wanted to 'add a number of modern twists to the design'

Former Jaguar test driver Norman Dewis said the new-look Mark 2 was something Mr Callum and the team at Classic Motor Cars should be 'very proud of'

'The stance of the Mark 2 is already excellent, but I wished to make it even better.'

The car now sits 30mm lower and on 17-inch split rim spoke wheels and the bumpers are part of the overall form of the car, 'it is a fine balance of extracting and adding'.

Mr Callum added: 'I have always loved traditional louvres as seen on many older race cars. Four louvres appear on the side of the car to add to that sense of power and something different.

'Of course they had to work, so they have been designed in a low-pressure area for a better internal airflow from the modified engine.'

The car was unveiled at the opening of CMC's state-of-the-art headquarters in Bridgnorth in front of racing driver legend John Surtees and former Jaguar test driver Norman Dewis.

Mr Dewis, 94, who has been associated with Jaguar for more than 60 years and was their chief development test engineer for 33 years, applauded the results of the Mark 2 makeover.

He said: 'Mark 2 by Callum is something special and I was delighted when I was asked to unveil the car.

'It is something that both Ian Callum and CMC should be very proud of.'
