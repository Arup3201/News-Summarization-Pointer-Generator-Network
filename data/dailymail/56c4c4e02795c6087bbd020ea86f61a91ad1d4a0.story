Accused: Richard Dawe is accused of breaching his ASBO by driving onto his neighbour's land and chasing her pregnant sheep around the field in his car

An 80-year-old pensioner breached his ASBO by driving onto his neighbour’s land before chasing her pregnant sheep around the field in his car, a court heard.

Richard Dawe is accused of attacking livestock belonging to next-door neighbour Barbara Wilkes, during an ongoing dispute between the pair, who live in the village of Castlemorton Common, Worcestershire.

Worcester Crown Court was told Dawe, who referred to himself as the 'Don of Castlemorton', had driven his Vauxhall Astra at speed towards the terrified herd of sheep.

The jury was told one of the expectant ewes died following the incident on March 18 of this year.

Roger Brown, prosecuting, told the court Dawe had first breached the ASBO, imposed in 2005, on November 21 last year when Mrs Wilkes spotted him damaging her son’s car.

Giving evidence, Mrs Wilkes told the court there had been a dispute between the neighbours over land, which left her so scared she carried a recording device every time she left the house.

The jury heard a recording Mrs Wilkes, 57, made on January 14 in which Dawe could be heard shouting and swearing at her as she fed her animals.

'I found it quite alarming and unpleasant,' she told the court.

'I expect something to happen every time and I carry a recording device whenever I go outside.'

The jury were also played a second recording from March 18 this year when her sheep strayed from common land into a field.

Dawe said he would get them out but was later spotted driving his car behind them as his dogs ran loose.

Under cross examination from Lee Masters, defending,  Mrs Wilkes admitted she could not be sure if the dead sheep was one of the ones chased.

The court was told that Dawe had threatened to attack Mrs Wilkes's sheep prior to the alleged attack in March, after comparing himself to the action film character Mad Max.

Giving evidence for a second day she said: 'Mr Dawe did threaten to set his dogs on to my sheep.

'His words were "I'll dog them out of it' referring to the field.

'Mr Dawe made lots of threats to do things to my sheep over the few days they were going in to the field.

'He was likening himself to Mad Max.'

She added: 'He often says he's the Don and he's in charge.

'These sort of events are happening frequently, in fact every time I come in contact with Mr Dawe.'

The court heard Mrs Wilkes's son Thomas had painted "Eeaw the donkey" on a white shed on her land facing Dawe's house.

Asked
 by defence barrister why he had done this, Mrs Wilkes added: 'It's 
something my son put on there because Mr Dawe calls himself the Don of 
Castlemorton.

'It's our way of dealing with it. If you can liken Don to a donkey rather than a mafia boss.

'It's different ways of dealing with a situation that I can't even begin to explain to people.

'Mr Dawe seems to delight by terrorising people by referring to himself as a Don, it's our way of dealing with it.

'It's not as offensive as some of the things Mr Dawe has called myself and other neighbours.'

Mrs Wilkes also told the jury about the moment she saw Dawe driving his car 'fast' at six to eight of her sheep.

The
 mental health nurse, who keeps sheep as a hobby, added: 'He was driving
 a car and the dogs were running around chasing my sheep.

'I only saw the one but I presume it was the two (dogs).

'I would say even 20 to 30mph would be very fast in a field. It looked fast because of the way he was covering the ground.'

Bespectacled
 Dawe, who wore a khaki-coloured shirt and a blue fleece, changed his 
plea to guilty for one of the four charges he is facing.

He admitted
 breaching his ASBO by being verbally abusive and using foul language 
towards Mrs Wilkes on January 14 by using the phrase 'a load of bloody 
c***s'

Dawe now denies a total of three charges including breaching 
his ASBO by using conduct likely to cause distress, alarm or harassment 
towards Mrs Wilkes by driving a car towards her sheep.

He also denies a charge of criminal damage and a charge of breaching the ASBO by damaging property.

The
 court heard those two charges relate to an incident on November 21 last
 year when Mrs Wilke's son's red Renault Clio was scratched after he 
parked it on a public track near Dawe's home.

In police interviews 
Dawe claimed the Wilkes family deliberately parked vehicles on the track
 to annoy him but denied causing the seven scratch marks.

He admitted driving at the sheep but said he did so slowly to shepherd them away.

He
 also claimed his two dogs were in his car at all times and said he only
 let them out of the vehicle once the sheep were out of the field and 
the gate was closed.

The court heard the ASBO was handed to Dawe at 
Birmingham Crown Court on October 5, 2004 and was due to expire on 
October 4 this year.

The trial, which is expected to last another two days, continues.
