Mayweather, 37, is still undefeated as a professional and is a five-division world champion.

He was recently involved in a brawl with rapper T.I at a Fatburger restaurant in Las Vegas.

The eight-time world champion is due to have his next fight in September, which rules out the possibility of fighting Amir Khan who cannot fight in September because he observes Ramadan.
