Valencia have expressed an interest in Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher.

The Spanish side are one of of three European teams to have made enquiries for the Scotland international.

The 30-year-old has six months left on contract at Old Trafford and is keen to gain more game time. He is happy at United and a key figure in the dressing room but recognises his first team opportunities are only going to diminish as more new players arrive.

Celtic have also asked about Fletcher but he is interested in other Premier League offers and intrigued by the ones from Spain and will make a decision over the next fortnight.

Fletcher has this season made 11 appearances for Manchester United in the Premier League, but the majority of them fleeting and from the bench.

An exit from Old Trafford would be a big decision for Fletcher, a player who has been at the club since the age of 11, signing his first professional contract at United in 2001.
