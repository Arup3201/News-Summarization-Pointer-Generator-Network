Hundreds of letters between a couple who were struggling through a long-distance romance in the 1950s are being brought back to life by a university student for her final-year dissertation.  

Sophie Abbott, 21, from Cullingworth, West Yorkshire, is using the ups and downs of the British couple's relationship for her final-year photography exhibition and dissertation.

The romantic box of letters tells the love story of long-distance couple - April and RAF member Ron, between 1952 and 1955. 

Sophie Abbott, 21, from Yorkshire is sorting 300 long distance letters between 'Ron and April' for her university dissertation. The couple corresponded between West Germany and London in the 1950s 

The letters, which start in 1952, highlight the couple's desire to keep their relationship alive, despite living over 400 miles apart. 

At the time, Ron was fighting for NATO within the British Army of the Rhine in Oldenberg, Germany, while April was living in Edmonton, London.

The letters, which stop suddenly in 1955, were found by a friend of Sophie's at a car boot sale years ago.

Sophie, who studies photography at the University of Huddersfield, said: 'I remember him bringing them into school one day. 

'Recently, I was contemplating over an idea for my final project and I remembered about these love letters. 

'I asked my friend if I could borrow them and luckily he was happy for me to borrow them.'

She continued: 'Now my everyday life is focused on going through these 300-400 letters. 

'It is pretty much a constant chore of delving further into Ron and April's story.' 

As well as letters, the box of correspondence also holds Valentine's Day cards and comic strips that the couple exchanged.

One typical note shows Ron 'very excited' after his girlfriend suggested the idea of moving into a houseboat on the Thames.

He often expresses his affection for April by writing 'I love you' several times on the same page.

Miss Abbott said: 'I want this project to be a realistic insight into a turbulent relationship. 

'Like any normal couple, the letters highlight their highs and lows while they were forced to spend time apart.

'As the letters are all dated, you can see some were actually sent quite close together.

'Because of this, they were often struggling to think of what to write to each other but they still persisted in keeping up regular contact.'

Sophie is planning on revealing more information about the couple in an exhibition for her university course 

Through her research, Miss Abbott managed to find out what happened to Ron and April after the letters stopped.

She added: 'Throughout the letters, the topic of marriage came up regularly. 

'They often talked about getting married in April 1955 and settling down together.

'I have now found out they did get married as planned in the letters and eventually had three children.'

Although Sophie has discovered that April has since died, she has so far failed to find any information on what happened to Ron. 

She is planning on revealing more information about the couple in an exhibition for her university course.

She is also hoping to write a book about the letters.

At the moment, Ron and April's full identity is being withheld from the public, as Sophie wants to behave in a sensitive manner towards any remaining members of their family.   

However, she is currently looking to get in touch with April and Ron's children, who she believes are called Nicholas, Steven and Kay in order to find out more.

Once the letters have been successfully scanned, which is expected to take weeks, Sophie will visit all of the places the couple discussed during their correspondence and will photograph them in their current state.

Sophie has already visited April's London Home in Edmonton, but she is also planning a trip to Germany, where Ron was stationed, and France, where April  lived later in the correspondence.

She raised the funds for her trip through a 'Kickstarter' campaign, called 'Do You Still Love Me Darling?'
