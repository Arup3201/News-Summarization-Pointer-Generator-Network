Killer: John Wayne Gacy murdered at least 33 teenage boys during the 1970s

Since John Wayne Gacy was executed for slaying at least 33 teenage boys in sexually-motivated crimes in the 1970s, investigators have long since wondered if the killer took secrets about other murders to his grave.

Now a U.S. Sheriff's office has discovered an innovative way to solve cold cases - by adding the DNA of long-dead serial killers into a national database.

Officers at the Sheriff's Department in Cook County, Illinois, have created DNA profiles of Gacy and other serial killers, and found a legal method of getting the executed killers' samples entered into databases shared with other law enforcement agencies.

They can do so because the murderers are technically listed as homicide victims themselves - once they have been put to death by the state.

The department now hopes to find 
matches of DNA evidence from blood, semen or strands of hair, or skin 
under the fingernails of victims that link the long-dead killers to the 
coldest of cold cases.

And 
they're hoping to prompt authorities in other states to submit the DNA 
of their own executed inmates or from decades-old crime scenes.

'You
 just know some of these guys did other murders', said Jason Moran, the detective leading the effort, noting that some of the executed
 killers ranged all over the country before the convictions that put 
them behind bars for the last time.

The
 Illinois testing, which began during the summer, is the latest chapter 
in a story that began when Sheriff Tom Dart exhumed the remains of 
unknown victims of Gacy to create DNA profiles.

These could be compared with the DNA of people whose loved ones went missing in the 1970s, when Gacy was killing young men.

That effort, which led to the identification of one Gacy victim, caused Dart to wonder if the technology could help answer a question that has been out there for decades: Did Gacy kill anyone besides those young men whose bodies were stashed under his house or tossed in a river? 

'He traveled a lot,' Moran said of Gacy. 'Even though we don't have any information he committed crimes elsewhere, the sheriff asked if you could put it past such an evil person.'

After unexpectedly finding three vials of Gacy's blood stored with other Gacy evidence, Moran learned the state would only accept the blood in the crime database if it came from a coroner or medical examiner.

Moran thought he was out of luck. But
 then Will County Coroner Patrick O'Neil surprised him with this 
revelation: In his office freezer were blood samples from Gacy and at 
least three other executed inmates.

The reason they were there is because
 after the death penalty was reinstated in Illinois in the 1970s, 
executions were carried out in Will County - all between 1990 and 1999, a
 year before then-Gov. George Ryan established a moratorium on the death
 penalty.

So it was O'Neil's office that conducted the autopsies and collected the blood samples - but there was bigger obstacle to come.

While the state does send to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System the profiles of homicide victims no matter when they were killed, it will only send the profiles of known felons if they were convicted since a new state law was enacted about a decade ago that allowed them to be included, Moran said. 

That meant the profile of Gacy, who received a lethal injection in 1994, and the profiles of other executed inmates could not qualify for the database under the felon provision. They could, however, qualify as people who died by homicide.

'They're homicides because the state intended to take the inmate's life,' O'Neil said.

Last year, authorities in Florida created a DNA profile from the blood of executed serial killer Ted Bundy in an attempt to link him to other murders.

But officials there, where the law allows profiles of convicted felons be uploaded into the database as well as the phase-in of profiles of people arrested on felony charges, don't know of any law enforcement agency reaching back into history the way Cook County's sheriff's office is.

'We haven't had any initiative where we are going back to executed offenders and asking for their samples,' said David Coffman, director of Florida Department of Law Enforcement's laboratory system. 'I think it's an innovative approach.'

O'Neil said he is still looking for blood samples of the rest of the 12 condemned inmates executed between 1977 when Illinois reinstated the death penalty and 2000 when then-Gov. George Ryan established a moratorium. So far, DNA profiles have been done on the blood of Gacy and two others; the profile of the fourth inmate has not yet been done.

Among the other executed inmates whose blood was submitted for testing was Lloyd Wayne Hampton, a drifter executed in 1998 for his crimes.

Not only did Hampton's long list of crimes include crimes outside the state - one conviction was for the torture of a woman in California - but shortly before he was put to death, he claimed to have committed other murders but never provided details.

So far, no computer hits have linked Gacy or the others to any other crimes. But Moran and O'Neil suspect there are investigators who are holding DNA evidence that could help solve them.

That is exactly what happened during the investigation into the 1993 slayings of seven people at a suburban Chicago restaurant, during which an evidence technician collected a half-eaten chicken dinner even though there was no way to test it for DNA at the time.

When the technology did become available, the dinner was tested and it revealed the identity of one of two men ultimately convicted in the slayings.

Moran says he wants investigators in other states to know that Gacy's blood is now open for analysis in their unsolved murders. He hopes those jurisdictions will, in turn, submit DNA profiles of their own executed inmates.

'That is part of the DNA system that's not being tapped into,' he said.
