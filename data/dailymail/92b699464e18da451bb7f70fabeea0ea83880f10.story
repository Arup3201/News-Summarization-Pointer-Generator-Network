A model mother-of-two claims her millionaire husband offered to pay a hitman $80,000 to have her murdered in a fit of jealousy after she wanted to return to work and posed for these raunchy modelling photos.

Monica, 32, gave up her catwalk career to marry the former waste disposal magnate turned vitamin tycoon Dino Guglielmelli in 2003. But after the births of their two daughters she wanted to return to work.

She launched her own Skin by Monica Olsen beauty line with the help of Guglielmelli and it went national through Duane Reade and Walgreens. She began talks about developing a film from a comic strip based on Monica.

'Hit the roof': A source said the tipping point for Monica Olsen's husband Dino Guglielmelli was when she posed for these pictures. Her 'jealous' husband hated the thought of men ogling at her, claimed a source

Jealous: 'It
 was a professional shoot in an LA  studio, there was a team of 
assistants, make up artists and stylists. But Dino accused Monica and Kenneth of getting too close,' a source said

Monica tried to relaunch her acting and modeling career at the end 
of 2010 but her husband objected from the get-go, according to the 
source close to the investigation.

And when he discovered she had also 
done an underwear shoot with fashion photographer Kenneth Matthews he 
'hit the roof;' a source close the investigation claimed.

Their relationship fell apart and they began a bitter custody battle over their two daughters. Some months later Monica discovered her husband had been taped trying to hire a friend to kill her.

The burly 52-year-old is set to stand trial next month on attempted murder and solicitation to murder charges.

'He became insanely jealous. He 
could not stand the idea that men were ogling his wife in raunchy magazines like Maxim,' the source said.

'The tipping point was a photo shoot she did with Kenneth Matthews in 2012. Dino saw the pictures and hit the roof.

'It
 was a professional shoot in an LA  studio, there was a team of 
assistants, make up artists and stylists. But Dino accused Monica and Kenneth of getting too close.

'Sure the photos are raunchy - they are underwear shots -- but that's what Monica's fans expect. Dino told her she wasn't doing anymore photo shoots. Period. 

Taped: A horrified friend of Guglielmelli (left) went to detectives after the bitter husband allegedly discussed 'specifics' about having his wife killed. He was said to be recorded saying: 'I'll be happy when it is all over'

Model and mother: Olsen gave up her successful modelling career in Manhattan to move to LA when she fell in love with her husband at the age of 22 and they had two daughters together. But then their relationship soured

Movies: Monica was also looking forward to developing a movie from a comic that was based on her

'He told her she needed to stay home 
and care for their daughters. By now Monica was concerned for her own 
safety. His anger was uncontrollable.

'But
 she insisted she wanted her career back. And that's when things turned 
really ugly. He banned her from having a life of her own.

'He stopped her doing anymore movie shoots, he killed a possible movie deal.

'That's
 when Monica knew she needed to leave him. And Dino went crazy. He was a
 control freak who needed to be win at everything. It was then he allegedly hired the hitman.'

As his behavior became more bizarre, Montreal-born Monica asked him to leave their Canyon Country, Santa Clarita, ranch.

She claims he responded by demanding custody of their daughters and calling cops to accuse her of attacking him. Monica spent a terrifying night in a jail cell, then filed for divorce.

But in October major case detectives from Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department told her they’d arrested Guglielmelli for attempted murder.

Guglielmelli allegedly offered ex Army veteran Richard Fuhrmann $80,000 to kill Monica. The would-be hitman went to the police, then secretly recorded a 90-minute lunch conversation.

On the tapes, which were played during a pre-trial hearing at a San Fernando court, Guglielmelli is heard saying: 'I’ll be happy when it is all over.'

After discussing 'specifics' on how to get rid of Monica, he then asks Furhmann: 'There’s no way for them to track it back to me?'

And he is also heard on tape reassuring Furhmann: 'You’re going to get paid. Don’t worry about that – I’ve got you covered.'

Businesswoman: Sources claimed that when her skin care products business scored success and went national through Duane Reade and Walgreens, he was upset because he wanted her 'pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen' rather than having a career

Terror: A source told MailOnline: 'He basically wrecked her life and if his alleged hitman-for-hire plan had worked she probably wouldn’t be here to tell the tale'

Guglielmelli, an aspiring singer in a rock band called COR, has been in custody since October after being unable to raise $10 million bail.

In November he granted his brother Gino power of attorney over his $50 million-a-year Creation’s Garden health and beauty business and filed for bankruptcy.

Listing debts of just over $1.5 million, the company’s assets, including $8 million stock, was auctioned off in February.

Monica, who claims her ex is still trying to sabotage her life from behind bars, is now fighting to regain her share of the business, which once employed 300 people.

She hopes to launch a new skin care line and kick- start her once promising acting career.

'Their joint beauty business was incredibly successful. But now it is bankrupt and she fears he has syphoned money off-shore.  It was as though he couldn’t stand her success. He wanted to be the star of the show and hated the fact she was doing so well.

'He basically wrecked her life and if his alleged hitman-for-hire plan had worked she probably wouldn’t be here to tell the tale.'

Claim and counter-claim: While Monica says she still lives in fear her husband's lawyer, from a noted Mafia family, said Guglielmelli was set up by the hitman

Monica, who starred opposite Rachel McAdams in the 2002 hit The Hot Chick, told Mail Online she was unable to talk because of the upcoming trial and her lawyer Ronald Lebow did not return calls for comment.

Assistant district attorney Emily Cole said: 'I am sure the defense wants to call lots of witnesses to say what a nice guy he is but my case is very simple. It is a murder for hire case. The divorce will come into it a little because it plays into his motives. But I have no plans to call Brett Ratner at this stage.'

Guglielmelli’s lawyer Tony Brooklier is a leading Mafia lawyer, whose father Dominic was the boss of the LA’s La Cosa Nostra. He has won acquittals for several mob-connected clients.  He insists Guglielmelli was set up by the alleged hitman.
