Chris Robshaw led his England team-mates through their final preparations for the top-of-the-table RBS 6 Nations clash with Ireland on the Aviva Stadium pitch on Saturday morning.

The England skipper took charge of the captain's run as the unbeaten red rose side completed their last session before Sunday's 4pm showdown between the competition's two unbeaten sides.

England surprised Wales at the Millennium Stadium with a 21-16 win in the first round of fixtures before seeing off Italy at Twickenham - and head coach Stuart Lancaster wants his side to draw inspiration from the win in Cardiff on what will be another atmospheric occasion in Dublin.

Sunday's match is the biggest of the 2015 Championship but Robshaw and Lancaster both know that if England finish as victors they will have a clear sight of the title with home games against Scotland and France remaining, and a potential Grand Slam.

Ireland start as marginal  favourites but England, who have recalled wing Jack Nowell and full-back Alex Goode, will draw on their victory at the Millennium Stadium for inspiration.

'Dublin is similar to Cardiff. History tells you it's a very difficult place to go and win,' Lancaster said.

'Sometimes when you're playing against Irish teams you feel like you're playing against 16 or 17 because of the energy that they bring. It will be as difficult a game as we've had in a long time.'

England turned around a 16-8 half-time deficit at the Millennium in January and Lancaster hopes they can replicate the second-half showing on Sunday.

'It would be nice to repeat what we did in Cardiff, especially the second half,' he said. 'One of the keys to that night was that we had a strong sense of belief we could win there, but the players still needed to deliver and they did that.

Ford was getting used to the pitch - and he could be key with the game two years ago being decided by kicks

'We need to have the same sense of belief, which we do, going into Sunday, but ultimately it will come down to the 80 minutes.

'Belief has to be built on some sort of foundation and the foundations laid in the last two weeks with wins against Wales and Italy have been excellent.

'That's why it's such a fascinating game because Ireland have been in the same position. I'd be very surprised if either team weren't ready for this game.

'The margins between the teams will be very small. It will be decided on key moments.'
