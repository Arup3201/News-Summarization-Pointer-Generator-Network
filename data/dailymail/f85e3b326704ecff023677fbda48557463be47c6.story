She's the bikini-clad paparazzo who finds the cameras turned on her when photographing celebrities.

The photographer is based in Miami where she loves to capture every day life as well as fashion. 

On her blog she writes: Whether it's the warmer climate, the turquoise water, the pastel buildings, or the breathtaking sunsets, there is just something about the Magic City that seems to inspire everyone.

'I hope to candidly showcase both Miami’s fabulous fashionistas and funky freaks in their natural habitats, with a major emphasis on the city herself as a main character.'

However, she did recently make headlines after a confrontation with singer Kanye West.

The photographer had bravely asked his girlfriend Kim if she knew
 her ex-boyfriend was having dinner with his pregnant girlfriend in the 
restaurant next door.

West was clearly angered by the question but after 
bumping into her again he ran over to Fazio and gave her a big hug.

Logan seems to enjoy having her own photograph taken rather than taking pictures judging by her Facebook page

The photographer is now making a name for herself as someone who should be on the other side of the lens.

According
 to her Facebook page, she is: 'Trying to turn the tables on the 
industry, gain some respect, and keep it classy. And have a little fun 
while I'm at it.'
