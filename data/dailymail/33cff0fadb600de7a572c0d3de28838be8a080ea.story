Jellyfish are becoming an unlikely new favourite pet in British homes after specialist fish tanks launched to house them have proved a sell out.

MailOnline reported last month how a U.S. firm could ship the high-tech tanks to the UK - but now a supplier in Eastleigh, Southampton, have made it easier for British buyers to adopt the unusual creatures with the new Cubic Jellyfish Aquarium.

Reef Eden International are distributing the novel tanks - which can house up to 12 non-stinging moon jellyfish - across the UK. And managing director Simon Garratt said demand has been so high they have already sold out and are struggling 
to keep up with demand.

Take them home: Moon jellyfish can now be kept as pets thanks to the development of new tanks

Accessorise: The tanks come with multi-coloured LED lights that can be altered to match the decoration of a room and create a living lava lamp effect

Mr Garratt explained how keeping jellyfish has pets has been made possible thanks to the accessory's special system that provides a circular current to allow the creatures to constantly float as they would in the sea.

He said: 'Previously people couldn't keep them
 because the aquariums weren't available, and they can't be kept in 
normal fish tanks because jellyfish require a current to swim.

Water flow: The £775 accessory has a special system that provides a circular current to allow the creatures to constantly float as they would in the sea

Unusual pets: Up to 12 moon jellyfish, which don't have stings, can be housed in the tanks and the water flow means they won't sink to the bottom or get stuck to the sides

'If there is no current, the jellyfish would stick in the corners of the tank or settle on the bottom.

'The systems that were available before were one-offs for big aquariums. This meant it cost tens of thousands
 of pounds for an organisation to have one made, but now we are 
manufacturing 50 to 100 at a time, it has brought the cost down 
massively.'

However the tanks still don't come cheap as they cost £775 from aquarium shops while the moon jellyfish have to be purchased separately from special stockists at prices between £29.99-£39.99.

Care: The jellyfish need to be fed once every one to two days with special food

As well as making interesting pets, jellyfish are being marketed as away to add decor to the home or office as the tank is illuminated by multicolour LED lights - giving the impression of 'a living lava lamp'.

The company's website states that the 'illuminated aquatic artwork' of the jellyfish aquarium beats any expensive sculptures and paintings.

Mr Garratt added: 'There are LED lights down the centre of the tank which can be set to different colours or go through the whole spectrum and light up the jellyfish like a living lava lamp.

'The look of the tank is very modern and works as a display and can appeal to a lot of people because it looks great and because it's low maintenance.'

The jellyfish need to be fed once every one to two days with special food which can be placed through a section at the top of the tank.
