Vincenzo Nibali may have charmed the Yorkshire public but he soon found out he could not steal the heart of all who witnessed his Tour de France stage two win.

The Italian stormed to victory on the stage between York and Sheffield but he was rejected by the podium girl when he went in for a celebratory kiss during the presentation of his yellow jersey.

He was given his maillot jaune and handed some flowers but as he went in for a kiss the podium girl awkwardly pulled away, leaving the Team Astana rider hanging.
