A scheduled Bill Cosby appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman next week has been cancelled as rape allegations continue to besiege the beloved comedian.

It is the second time in a month that the 77-year-old has been dropped from a TV lineup, after he withdrew from Queen Latifah's talk show.

Decades-old accusations of rape came back to haunt Cosby last month after stand-up comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about Cosby, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a live performance.

A video of the rant quickly spread online, reigniting a fire that has long burned, and inspiring one woman, Barbara Bowman, to come forward and share her story withThe MailOnline, claiming she was sexually assaulted by Cosby when she was 19. 

Cancelled: Bill Cosby representative David Brokaw confirmed Friday night the comedian would not appear on The Late Show With David Letterman as previously scheduled next Wednesday. Cosby's last appearance on the show, seen here, was January 13, 2014

A spokeswoman for The Late Show confirmed to Newsday that Cosby's guest booking for Wednesday had been cancelled.

However it is unclear whether it was Cosby or Letterman et al that decided to pull out.

Spokespeople for Queen Latifah's talk show reported that it was Cosby who withdrew from his spot on October 31

Allegations of rape were first levelled against Cosy in 2005 in a lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand, 32, a former Temple University employee

Constand claimed she had been sexually assaulted in Cosby's Philadelphia mansion in 2004.

She also said her suit contained the testimonies of 13 other women with similar claims.

The suit was settled in 2006 for an undisclosed amount.

Bowman has now come forward identifying herself as one of those women.

Telling her story: Barbara Bowman told MailOnline how Cosby 'raped and drugged her' while she was just a teenager

Under fire: The 77-year-old Emm - and Grammy-winning actor and comedian, who has been married for 50 years and has five children, has been battling accusations of sex assault for more than three decades. He is seen here giving a Veterans Day speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday 

'I was drugged and raped by that man,' she told The MailOnline.

'He is a monster. He came at me like a monster. My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful.

'If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.'

Bowman was just a teenager at the time she met Cosby, and soon the actor was flying her to meet him around the country and putting her up in the nicest hotels.

Things changed however when one night she passed out after a glass of wine and woke up vomiting in the toilet wearing Cosby's white t-shirt.

Bowman is certain that she had been drugged by Cosby. And she believes raped by him too.

After that her relationship with Cosby changed, and by 19 he had sent her on her way after a final night in Atlantic City where she claims he tried to rape her.

Cosby has not commented on the allegations and has never been charged with sexual assault.

He has been married for 50 years and has five children 

Decades old rape allegations against Bill Cosby came back to haunt the comedian once again on Monday when a supposedly harmless social media stunt blew up in his face

On Monday, Cosby, in an attempt to connect with his Twitter followers, invited fans to create memes using a selection of photos of him.

However the idea majorly backfired.

His Twitter feed was inundated with memes that referenced the rape claims.

Not long after, Cosby’s original tweet was deleted and the meme generator was removed from the site and the link now redirects people to Cosby’s homepage.
