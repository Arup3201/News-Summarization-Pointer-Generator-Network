Nigel Farage today admits his party’s election prospects have been damaged by its ‘Walter Mitty’ characters.

He says UKIP got it wrong in the past and now needs to show greater discipline to secure success at the ballot box.

But he warned against mimicking the command and control ethos of Tony Blair's New Labour party machine, when pagers were issued to tell party members what to say at all times.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said his party will clamp down on Walter Mitty characters before next year's general election

Ukip is expected to come first in elections to the European Parliament on May 22.

But Mr Farage's party has been rocked by yet more revelations about the views of candidates and councillors which risk undermining his claim to be a mainstream political force.

In the run-up to last year's council elections, candidates were exposed for wearing a Jimmy Savile mask, blaming the Holocaust on Jews and branding Margaret Thatcher an 'old w****'.

Just this month Mr Farage has had to suspend a councillor who blamed the winter storms on gay marriage.

American humorist James Thurber wrote The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty for the New Yorker magazine in 1939.

A Walter Mitty character was originally a harmless day-dreamer, who disengages from the real world by turning his small everyday failures and humiliations into grandiose fantasies, with himself cast as the hero.

But over the years the name has acquired a more pejorative sense, coming to mean a self-deluding, self-aggrandising fraudster, who tries to gain respect by pretending to be something he’s not.

The story has inspired not one film — the  celebrated 1947 version with Danny Kaye,  which propelled the name ‘Walter Mitty’ into the English language — but two.

Ben Stiller directed, co-produced and starred in The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty released last month.

Now the Ukip leader is promising tougher vetting of candidates to weed out people who could cause him embarrassment.

‘It’s very natural that a newish party will attract all sorts of people,’ he told The Times.

‘Walter Mittys seeking a role in politics – in the end they will let down not just us but themselves.

‘I need us to have a disciplined election machine.’

His comments come just a day after it emerged that a senior member of the party, Godfrey Bloom, apparently taunted a disabled student during an Oxford University debate.

Mr Bloom was appearing at the debate last Thursday and asked the young man whether he was Richard III, the medieval king who suffered from a spinal deformity.

Last week the party was again embarrassed by one of its more controversial members, David Silvester, who claimed recent floods were divine punishment for new gay marriage laws.

Mr Farage said he wanted to ‘professionalise’ UKIP ahead of the European elections in May in which his party are expected to trouble the Conservatives. 

He suggested he may wish to curb the eccentricities of individual candidates and said the party must campaign together on similar issues.

But Mr Farage said he did not want UKIP to turn ‘into a new Labour outfit where they’ve all got pagers on their belts and they’re told what to say and think’.

Keen to appeal to blue-collar people, he 
claimed a third of UKIP’s support derives from former Labour voters. He 
immediately risked alienating them, however, by saying that bankers were
 entitled to receive large bonuses.

‘The very thought that the bureaucrats in
 Brussels now set the limits we can pay the highest earning people in 
London is truly astonishing,’ he added.

Mr Farage said the party need to appear more professional if they are to succeed at the ballot box. His comments come as Godfrey Bloom, pictured, appeared to taunt a disabled student during a debate at Oxford University

The stockbroker’s son said: ‘We don’t need official caps or limits being placed on these things. Don’t forget that quite a lot of this comes back to people in terms of pension incomes and the rest of it.’

Mr Farage also attacked high public sector pay, especially in local government, saying there were a ‘remarkable’ number of people working in local authorities and quangos who were on six-figure salaries.

While Labour is facing a growing backlash in the business community as a result of its 50p tax rate plan, UKIP has been courting big donors as anti-Europe sentiment has increased in the City.

However, Mr Farage refused to be drawn on any economic policies, nor would he be drawn into giving a date as to when the UK deficit should be cut by.
