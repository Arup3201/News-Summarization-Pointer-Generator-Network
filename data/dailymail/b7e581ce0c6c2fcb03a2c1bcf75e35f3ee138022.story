With the summer in full swing and temperatures rising, it may seem like a great idea to take a cool dip in the ocean, but according to a new report, some beach-goers may be getting more than they bargained for.

Ten percent of water samples taken from U.S. coastal and lake beaches fail to meet safety standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a new report finds.

'There can be hidden dangers lurking in many of our waterways in the form of bacteria and viruses that can cause a great inventory of illnesses like dysentery, hepatitis, stomach flu, infections and rashes,' Steve Fleischli, water program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said.

Of nearly 3,500 samples taken annually at beaches around the country, Great Lakes beaches have the highest failure rate, with excessively high bacteria levels, the defense council said.

Rolling in the dirt: Ontario Beach in Monroe County, New York was labelled as a 'repeat offender' with poor water quality

Polluted: Cockle Cove Creek in Barnstable County in Massachusetts was on the NRDC's list of repeat offenders

Nasty: Beachwood Beach in Ocean County New Jersey had water samples below safety standards

California:  Malibu Pier, 50 yards East of the pier, in Los Angeles County

Indiana: Jeorse Park Beach in Lake County

Massachusetts: Cockle Cove Creek in Barnstable County

Maine: Goodies Beach in Knox County

New Jersey: Beachwood Beach in Ocean County

New York: Main Street Beach in Chautauqua County

The findings confirm that water pollution caused by storm-water runoff and sewage overflows persists at many U.S. beaches, the agency said.

Storm-water runoff often includes trash, chemicals, oil and animal and human waste as well as bacteria and viruses.

'It's really all of our urban slobber going untreated into local waterways,' Fleischli said.

Swimming in bacteria-infested waters can cause stomach flu, skin rashes and pinkeye. The report stated that children tend to be most susceptible to these and other waterborne illnesses likely because they tend to submerge their heads.

Beaches in California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin were listed as ‘repeat offenders.’

Sickening: Two-thirds of beach closings and advisories were caused by bacteria levels surpassing public health standards

Hazardous: It may look pristine, but Malibu Pier, 50 yards east of the pier, in Los Angeles County had violations

Delaware: Dewey Beach-Swedes in Sussex County

Florida: Bowman's Beach in Lee County

Georgia: Tybee Island North in Chatham County

Massachusetts: Singing Beach in Essex County

New Jersey: Stone Harbor at 96th St. in Cape May County

Louisiana fared particularly poorly, with 29 per cent of the reported water samples below safety standards, followed by Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.

A
 dozen U.S. beaches received a five-star rating 
indicating strong testing and safety practices, as well as low violation
 rates.

The agency singled out 35 popular 'superstar' beaches that have excellent water quality.

Each of these met national water quality standards 98 percent of the time over the past five years.

In the Great Lakes, 13 percent of samples failed to meet federal public health standards, the researchers said.

Other regions with excessively high bacteria in swimming water samples include: the Gulf Coast (12 percent), New England (11 percent), the western coast (9 percent), New York and New Jersey coasts (7 percent), and the southeast (7 percent).

States with the highest failure rates include: Ohio (35 percent), Alaska (24 percent) and Mississippi (21 percent).

For cleaner water, try the Delmarva Peninsula area on the East Coast, where 4 percent of samples failed the test.

Three states had a failure rate of just 3 percent: Delaware, New Hampshire and New Jersey, the researchers found.

Beach-goers who wish to avoid swimming in polluted waters are advised to choose beaches away from urban areas; stay away from pipes that drain storm water runoff; and avoid swimming for at least a day after heavy rains.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has estimated that up to 3.5million people become ill from contact with raw sewage from sanitary sewer overflows each year, and that number could even be higher since many people who become ill after swimming in polluted water are unaware of the underlying cause of their symptoms, and it often goes unreported.
