A schoolboy plotted to carry out a ‘new Columbine massacre’ – bombing schools, a university, mosque and cinema, a court has heard.

The neo-Nazi fanatic stockpiled an arsenal of weapons at his home in Loughborough, including pipe bombs, petrol bombs, air rifles and a crossbow in preparation for a wave of atrocities, the Old Bailey heard.

The boy, who was 16 when he was arrested, is accused of planning to unleash terror at a sixth-form college where he was studying A-levels and a former school where he had been bullied.

Terror trial: The suspect, who cannot be named so his face is hidden, is accused of stockpiling weapons to Columbine-style massacre in Loughborough

Other targets were said to have included Loughborough University, a mosque, a cinema and council offices.

In a notebook covered with swastikas, the boy, who suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, allegedly wrote how he would ‘enter each classroom taking out the teachers; use explosives to eliminate most of the students’.

Inspired by the mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999 in which two teenagers murdered 13 classmates in Colorado, the boy is said to have compiled a ‘hitlist’ of 19 teachers and pupils in his notebook under the heading ‘Plans and Tactics for Operation the New Columbine’.

And giving evidence today, the boy's 
former science teacher told the court he would look at weapons on the 
internet while at school, and even asked which weapon he would like to
be shot with.

The teacher, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'He was encouraging me to look at the guns and make some sort of judgment about whether it was a good gun.

'He asked me which gun I would prefer to be shot with. The message - which I took to as an empty threat at the time - was he was considering a shooting.'

The teacher claimed that the student would launch 'tirades' against particular religions, aiming his abuse mainly at the Muslim and Jewish faiths, as well as targeting a pupil with German grandparents.

He said: 'Instances of racism, tirades - long, drawn out - which were frankly painful to listen to. He seemed to believe that people of the Muslim religion did not have a place in this country.'

'He said, 'I f*****g hate Muslims' and expressed a desire to blow up a mosque.'

Legal arguments: Prosecutor Max Hill QC (left) told the jury that if they believe the suspect, who is represented by Ali Bajwa QC (right), was planning a massacre then they should find him guilty

The teacher added: 'He was aware I'm a
chemistry teacher. He also liked to ask about explosives which I did 
not get involved with because I do not want to be the one to teach 
someone how to commit an atrocity.'

The
teenager also claimed to have gone to an English Defence League (EDL) 
march and asked the teacher if he had attended, the court heard.

'I can only guess that he takes pleasure in humiliating and trying to intimidate with such a remark,' said the teacher.

When police raided the accused's home in 
February this year they were shocked to  find terrorist manuals and an 
astonishing array of weapons in the bedroom of ‘an average young man in 
an average house’.

They
found partially assembled petrol bombs, pipe bombs and other explosive 
devices, pyrotechnic fuse cords, a stab proof vest, a gas mask, three 
.22 rifles, two .22 blank firing pistols, three ball-bearing guns, a 
crossbow and a military belt.

The
teenager, who is now 17, cannot be named for legal reasons, had a giant
swastika flag above his bed and was a member of the extremist English 
Defence League.

Jurors heard yesterday how he fantasised about mass killings in disturbing recordings and a notebook covered with swastikas, alongside the words ‘EDL no surrender British and proud’ and the mantra: ‘When order fails, violence prevails’.

Jurors were shown extracts said to outline his plans. The boy allegedly wrote: ‘Before we go into school gates, enter K block and chain both exits shut.

'Enter each classroom taking out the teachers. Use explosives to eliminate most of the students.’

The defendant also drew a stick figure with arrows showing where weapons and explosives would be concealed inside a trench coat for his ‘operation’, the court heard.

On other pages he described filling a can of fuel with nails, screws and ball bearings before lighting it with a rag or an electrical connection wired to a phone.

On a Dictaphone he allegedly recorded himself saying: ‘I think soon I’m going to be doing some tests. Test some explosive maybe.

‘So I know what is easiest to make, most effective and reliable. I think I’m going to make a pipe bomb cause they sound pretty easy and testing these things will tell me the amount of stuff I need to carry out the operation.’

On a later recording he said: “How the **** could anyone treat a fellow person like people’s treated me. That’s a question you want to be asking, that’s what drives people to do this. Look at all the ******* things in the past . . . Columbine, Virginia Tech, numbers of others. All because of bullying and how people are treated.’

Plan: Targets were alleged to include Loughborough University and five other sites in the area

The notebook contained essays on his apparent hatred of Muslims.

He allegedly wrote: ‘There’s too many Muslims in the UK and Europe, so we must stop them coming over here and send the ones already over here back home before they take over European governments and put Sharia Law in place.’

Jurors were shown videos of the then 16-year-old and two friends, who dubbed themselves the United Revolutionary Army, making bombs out of white spirit and bottles.

The balaclava-clad gang throw them at a wall at the back of the property, causing a short burst of flames.

Max Hill QC, prosecuting, said: ‘He is talking about British people rising up and fighting Islamic fascism that is sweeping the world.

'He is a member of the EDL Leicester division and a supporter of the Knights Templar, which we suggest are far-right wing British National movements.’

The defendant, dressed in a black T-shirt, sat slumped in the dock yesterday with his head bowed.

He is said to have targeted the Reel Cinema in Loughborough because of ‘the attitude of the staff and the prices’, the court heard.

He listed Loughborough council offices because of an apparent grievance with a Pakistani member of staff.

Mr Hill said: ‘For an average young man in an average house, the list [of weapons] you may think is startling. Child’s play?

‘You will be considering whether he is just a misfit, or whether he is something altogether more sinister.’

The boy denies possessing items for terrorism and possessing a terror manual, the ‘Mujahideen Poisons Handbook’. He has admitted possession of petrol bombs and pipe bombs but denies having parts for making improvised explosive devices.

The trial continues.
