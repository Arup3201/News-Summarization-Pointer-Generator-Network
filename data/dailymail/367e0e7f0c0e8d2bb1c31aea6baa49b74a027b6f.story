Two New York State boys suffered serious injuries after an inflatable bounce house was swept into the air before dumping them back on the ground from 15 feet up.

In the nightmarish scene, the boys aged 5 and 6 were playing in the carnival staple Monday afternoon at a South Glens Falls apartment complex when winds spun the bounce house around as if in a tornado before blowing it into the air.

One boy smashed down onto a parked car while the other landed in a street. A third child, a 10-year-old girl, suffered only scrapes after falling out just as the structure took off.

Nightmarish: This dramatic photo shows an inflatable bounce house that blew to 50 feet in the air before dumping out two boys from around 15 feet and leaving them seriously injured

Way up: The children had long since fallen out when they shocking photos were taken. The bouncy house flew an estimated 50 high and made it past a stretch of woods before finally drifting back to earth and landing behind a local school

The boys were hospitalized Monday afternoon with serious injuries.

One boy suffered serious head trauma, while the other sustained two broken arms as well as facial injures, a neighbor told the Post-Star.

Unbelievable: Witnesses say two boys fell from 15 feet. One landed on a parked car, while the other smashed into a car and both sustained serious injuries

'It was like a horror movie,' complex resident Taylor Seymour. 'It just kept going up and up. It cleared our building and the trees.'

It was on Seymour's car that one of the children landed.

The structure went on to blow a full 50 feet into the air and one witness snapped a shocking picture of it hovering above.

The mother of the little girl agreed.

'My older daughters witnessed it and said it was just horrible,' she said, without giving her name. 'A big gust of wind just blew it right off the ground with the kids in it. It's just sickening.'

'The witnesses said it was a sudden burst of wind and it just lifted off the ground,' Patrolman David Gifford told the Post-Star. 'It was just a freak accident.'

Gifford and the little girl's mother said the bounce house was tethered to the ground with stakes but that it was blown loose.

The structure was owned by a resident of the complex. It landed behind a nearby school after clearing a stretch of woods.

The owner told the Post-Star that she'd set up the Little Tikes brand toy several times in the two years she'd owned it.

The mother of the lucky little girl, at least, wasn't not pointing fingers anyway.

'I don't think people know that this can happen when it's windy,' she said.

Up gone terribly wrong: The bouncy house's skyward journey evoked images of the Disney/Pixar film Up, though the South Glens Falls incident began with a day of fun and ended terribly

Dangerous: The structure was similar to the one pictured and was owned by a resident of the apartment complex in South Glens Falls, New York where the incident occurred. A third child, a 10-year-old little girl, manged to escape just as the structure took off and received only minor injuries
