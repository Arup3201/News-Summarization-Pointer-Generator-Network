Arsenal face a nervous wait to see if their growing injury crisis has deepened even further after Danny Welbeck hobbled off  during England's 1-0 defeat of Estonia.

The 23-year-old left the field after appearing to go to ground with an ankle knock towards the end of the Euro 2016 qualifier in Tallinn. According to Sportsmail's Neil Ashton, he limped along the touchline before heading directly to the dressing room with an England physio.

Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson played down the extent of the injury and claimed that Welbeck would be fit to return at the weekend, saying: 'I don't think he's injured. He just rolled his ankle slightly. The doctors are not worried about it.'

The former Manchester United forward arrived at the Emirates in a £16million move on deadline day and, despite the fears of some Arsenal supporters, has impressed with four goals - including a hat-trick in the Champions League against Galatasaray.

Welbeck has also been scoring freely for England since leaving Old Trafford, netting a brace against Switzerland and another strike against San Marino before Sunday's game that saw England maintain their 100 per cent record.

Wenger is already without TEN players with Mesut Ozil, Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta, Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy, Serge Gnabry, Yaya Sanogo, Theo Walcott and Laurent Koscielny sidelined by injury - while Calum Chambers is suspended for the next game.
