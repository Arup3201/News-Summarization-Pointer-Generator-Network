Italy put aside their dismal showing at the World Cup in Brazil to cruise to a 2-0 victory over Holland at the Stadio San Nicola in Bari on Thursday.

The Azzurri were knocked out of the World Cup at the group stage with just three points but goals from Ciro Immobile and Daniele De Rossi inside the first 10 minutes of this encounter gave Antonio a comfortable victory in his first match in charge.

Guus Hiddink oversaw his first Holland match since 1998 but he will not have been impressed with what he witnessed. Bruno Martins Indi was dismissed after just nine minutes to allow De Rossi to net from the spot and double Italy's advantage, and Holland simply did not recover.

The departure of Louis van Gaal, who inspired Holland to a semi-final in Brazil, to Manchester United also saw the removal of the in vogue 3-5-2 formation for the Dutch, who instead opted for a more fluid 4-3-3.

Robin van Persie was joined in the starting line-up by new United team-mate Daley Blind, who signed for £14million from Ajax on transfer deadline day, as well as Newcastle United full-back Daryl Janmaat and former Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt. Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben was deemed unfit and did not even find himself on the bench.

Italy, meanwhile, rested Juventus legend Gianluigi Buffon and instead started with Salvatore Sirigu in goal. Borussia Dortmund forward Ciro Immobile and debutant Sassuolo Zaza were chosen to lead the line in Mario Balotelli's absence - the £16m Liverpool striker was suspended for the match.

And it was the home side who dominated the match from the off, with Immobile streaming through after just three minutes to open his account for Italy. After receiving a long ball through the middle, Immobile ran past Stefan De Vrij and Martins Indi before rounding Holland 'keeper Jasper Cillessen and stroked the ball home.

But it would only get worse for the Dutch as seven minutes later they found themselves with a two-goal deficit and a man down. Zaza displayed his raw power to rush in behind Martins Indi and force the defender to drag him down inside the box.

Martins Indi was the last man and had to go - and Hiddink could only watch from the bench as Italy captain De Rossi stepped up and slotted the ball into the bottom corner from the spot. 

The rest of the first half continued in much the same vein, with Italy missing guilt-edged chances through Mattia De Sciglio and Zaza.  

Holland did improve marginally in the second half although, in truth, they could hardly have performed much worse.

Their best chance came when Azzurri defender Andrea Ranocchia could only clear a Kuyt cross straight to Blind, whose cushion header gave Van Persie a chance to score but he smashed his left-foot volley harmlessly past the post. 

Aside from a couple of Van Persie misses, there was little for the Dutch to be proud about. They were simply outclassed from the very first minute to the last.

Italy's main threat all night had been the pace of Zaza and Immobile up front, but Leonardo Bonucci almost stole the headlines with a thunderbolt from 35 yards which forced Cillessen into a nervy parry.

Conte can be pleased with his first match in charge. Hiddink on the other hand has a lot of thinking to do.
