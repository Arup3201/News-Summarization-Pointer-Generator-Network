A former fellow inmate of Australian serial killer Peter Dupas has told an inquest that the convicted killer had spoken of murdering a 95-year-old Melbourne woman, whose brutal death remains unsolved.

Police allege Dupas fatally stabbed Kathleen Downes, a mother-of-three who was found in her bed at a Brunswick nursing home in Victoria with her throat cut and multiple stab wounds in December 1997.

Sergeant David Dimsey told a Victorian Coroners Court inquest into Ms Downes' death that there were clear links between her murder and Dupas' other killings, such as the choice of weapon, The Hearald Sun reports.

Victorian serial killer Peter Dupas (pictured centre in 2004) has been accused of killing 95-year-old Kathleen Downes

Ms Downes, a mother-of-three, was found in her bed at a Brunswick nursing home in Victoria with her throat cut and multiple stab wounds in December 1997

He added that Dupas' motivation for killing the 95-year-old was likely to be her close appearance to his own mother, whom he was known to have disliked.

Dupas was revealed to have called his alleged victim’s nursing home under a false name in the month leading up to her death, claiming to be inquiring about a place for his mother. 

Andrew Fraser, a former lawyer and convicted drug trafficker, told the inquest that Dupas spoke of the murder of the 'old sheila' while they were imprisoned together.

Mr Fraser said that Dupas once told him, 'I reckon I'm going to end up wearing the old sheila Downes too.'

He claims Dupas mentioned Ms Downes on two other occasions, saying that he left no forensic evidence at the murder scene of the 'old sheila down the road'.

Dupas' barrister, John Desmond, accused Mr Fraser of lying, saying he was motivated by an early release from prison and a reward.

Dupas is serving life without parole after he was convicted of killing Mersina Halvagis in Fawkner Cemetery in 1997 and of the mutilation murders of Margaret Maher in October 1997 and Nicole Patterson in April 1999.

Mr Fraser also gave a crucial testimony that Dupas made incriminating statements to him over Ms Halvagis's stabbing death, while the pair were jail mates at Port Phillip Prison.

Dupas is serving life without parole after he was convicted of killing Mersina Halvagis (whose relatives are pictured in 2005) in Fawkner Cemetery in 1997 and of the mutilation murders of Margaret Maher in October 1997 and Nicole Patterson in April 1999

The serial killer was not present during the proceedings, but watched the event over video link from prison.

He will be called to present evidence on Thursday, however it is expected that he will refuse to comment in similar fashion to previous interviews regarding Ms Dowes death, according to the Herald Sun.

Police believe he may be responsible for at least three other unsolved murder mysteries.

The inquest continues.
