Uganda could soon be jailing homosexuals for life after the president said he intended to sign an anti-gay bill.

It comes after Yoweri Museveni received a report from ‘medical experts’ saying ‘homosexuality is not genetic but a social behaviour’, a government spokesman wrote on Twitter.

Homosexuality, which Museveni has called abnormal, is a crime in Uganda. The bill, approved by parliament in December, would legalise life imprisonment for some acts.

Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan president, is poised to sign a law which would make some homosexual acts punishable by up to life in prison

Museveni announced his decision to 
governing party lawmakers, said government spokesman Ofwono Opondo.

In
 Twitter posts on Friday, Opondo said the legislators, who are holding a
 retreat chaired by Museveni, 'welcomed the development as a measure to 
protect Ugandans from social deviants.'

Evelyn Anite, a spokeswoman for the governing party, said the report, which had been requested by the president, was prepared by more than a dozen scientists from Uganda's Health Ministry.

Opondo and Anite both said the president did not indicate when he will sign the legislation into law.

Homosexuality already is illegal in Uganda under a colonial-era law that criminalizes sex acts 'against the order of nature.'

An earlier version of the bill, first introduced in 2009, proposed the death penalty for some homosexual acts, although that sentence was removed after international pressure.

The bill is popular in Uganda, one of many sub-Saharan African countries where homosexuals face severe discrimination.  A new law in Nigeria last month increased penalties against gays.

Museveni, who has criticized gays as 'abnormal' people who should be 'rehabilitated,' had previously called the bill too harsh.

Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo tweeted the announcement saying he welcomed the measure to protect the country from 'social deviants'

Ugandan lawmakers passed it on Dec. 20. Since then Museveni has been under pressure within his own party to sign the legislation, which has wide support among Christian clerics and lawmakers who say it is needed to deter Western homosexuals from 'recruiting' Ugandan children.

The bill before Museveni would allow life imprisonment for acts of 'aggravated homosexuality,' defined as sex acts where one of the partners is infected with HIV, sex with minors or the disabled, and repeated sexual offenses among consenting adults.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recently passed a law banning gay 'propaganda', also arguing the measure was to protect children

The bill also would make conducting a same-sex marriage ceremony punishable by seven years in prison.

On Friday, the watchdog group Human Rights First expressed 'deep concern' over news that the bill will be signed into law, saying it 'will have severely adverse consequences for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people as well as other Ugandans.'

Robyn Lieberman of Human Rights First said: 'There should be no doubt that Museveni's latest words on the subject have been influenced by the reaction to similar legislation in Nigeria, Russia and elsewhere.'

Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said: 'Unless this bill is stopped from becoming law, lives will be destroyed and countless people will be punished for an immutable characteristic.'

He addded: 'Anti-LGBT Americans advocated for laws further criminalizing LGBT people in Uganda, and it looks like they are now getting their wish.

'Whether it's Brian Brown advocating for anti-LGBT laws in Russia or Scott Lively calling for the further criminalization of LGBT people in Uganda, anti-LGBT Americans must stop exporting their hate abroad.'

Brown is president of the National Organization for Marriage, a Washington-based group that opposes same-sex marriage.

A Russian law, signed by President Vladimir Putin in June, bans gay 'propaganda' from reaching minors.

The law has drawn strong international criticism and calls for a boycott of the Sochi Games from gay activists and others.
