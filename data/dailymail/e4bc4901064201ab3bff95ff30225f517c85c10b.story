A new study has cracked the code on how children develop an understanding for language and vocabulary.

The research by the University of Western Sydney discovered that children aged three to six start to use the same strategies as adults when identifying new facts and objects.

This follows previous studies which uncovered baby talk to infants was a pivotal part of their learning, where adults naturally start to use a more sophisticated form of speech once the child reaches their first birthday.

A new university study has found that adults should be clearer in messages to pre-schoolers

The recent study found that children aged three to six, like adults, were able to use a process of elimination to arrive at an answer.

But their understanding of how new words and expressions are linked to objects can be different from adults.

Co-researcher Karen Mattock says when children hit this age group, adults should be using 'child directed speech'.

'This means we should be clearer and give short, simple and repeated instructions to better convey the message,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'When you are teaching your child the names of items or giving information about them, keep in mind that their knowledge about language is different, so make sure they are attending to you as well as to the item you are talking about and encourage your child to ask questions.

'These quality interactions go a long way to helping your childâ€™s vocabulary and knowledge grow.'

That's not to say that baby talk should be eliminated.

'At a young age this is very important for an infant's learning,' Ms Mattock said.

'The melody of baby talk maintains the infant's interest and allows them to capture emotions which facilitates bonding.

'Also the sing song nature of it and the exaggerated, hyper articulation of stretching out vowels also helps with their development.'

The research is part of a wider three year study into children and language.

'Young children are amazing at the way they quickly gain language skills,' Ms Mattock said.

'What we wanted to do is find out more about the way children learn words so we can give parents the best strategies to teach new words to their children.'
