A school security officer who had sex with a 15-year-old student has escaped jail - much to anger of the teen victim's mother.

Patience Perez of Norfolk,Virginia was sentenced to two years in jail with all but seven months suspended.

The judge told the 24-year-old she can remain free as long as she undergoes counseling and meets other conditions.

Patience Perez was also once thought to be plotting her husband's murder with her 15 year-old victim but police later dropped the charges

But the boy's mother lashed out at the lenient sentence saying it was like 'an arrow to the heart'.

The mum said: 'We haven't wrapped our brain around it,'

'It doesn't make sense. It's like we endured all this pain all this stress and for this to happen. Just like an arrow to the heart.'

In an earlier interview the mother had claimed Perez 'preyed on my baby'.

'She took advantage of teenage boy that had depression issues, anger issues, ' she said

The mother, who has not been named, discovered the affair when she found a naked photo of Perez on her son's phone last March.

Patience was a former security guard at the Virginia Beach Renaissance Academy in Virginia

Perez left Norfolk County Court on Friday hand in hand with her husband Gilbert.

He had stood by her after she was arrested last April on charges of underage sex.

Charges that Perez conspired with her teen lover to have him killed were dropped at an earlier hearing.

Court documents revealed that Perez had told her teen lover her husband was abusing her and they plotted to have him killed.

Facebook messages between the pair detailed the murder for hire plot.

Police in Norfolk dropped the charges.

Perez had met the student while working as a security officer at the Renaissance Academy in Virginia Beach.

They had sex on multiple occasions while her sailor husband was away at her home in Norfolk. She also had sex with the teen at his home in Virginia Beach.

The couple also sent each other pornographic pictures on their cell phones.

Their affair came to an end after the boy's mother found Perez's naked picture and went to the school.

She initially thought Perez was another student but learned she was an assistant security officer.

Perez was told by the court all but seven months of the two year sentence was being suspended.

The judge told her she will have to register as a sex offender and stay away from her victim.

If she completes a counseling course she will not have to go to jail.

Perez still faces child sex charges in Virginia Beach and the victim's mum said she hopes that court will not be as lenient.

'I hope that that prosecutor cares more about my family than Norfolk did, ' The boy's mother told News Channel 3.
