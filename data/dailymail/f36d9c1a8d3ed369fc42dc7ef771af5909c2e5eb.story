Football referee Kevin Friend failed to live up to his name after denying a gambler a £500,000 win.

The Premier League official denied the punter the huge windfall after blowing for full time just one second before a crucial goal went in.

A man from Oldham, who does not wish to be named, had put a wager on a series of unlikely scores in cup football matches this weekend including Leeds United to beat Tottenham 3-1.

Last gasp: Tottenham, in black and grey, take a free kick from the right hand side in a bid for a late equaliser. Goalkeeper Brad Friedel, in green, is even in the penalty box

Defended: A Leeds player manages to head the ball clear and it looks as if Tottenham's chance has gone

Tables turned: A Leeds midfielder feeds the ball to Rodolph Austin who has free run to Tottenham's goal as goalkeeper Brad Friedel can do nothing

Incredibly, all the results had come in except the match at Elland Road which seemed destined to finish agonisingly close at 2-1.

But in the dying seconds of injury time, with Spurs 'keeper Brad Friedel up for a corner, Leeds cleared the ball and it was left to midfielder Rodolph Austin to pump it into an empty net from long range.

He duly took his shot, but just one second before the ball rolled across the line the referee signalled the end of the match.

Moments from glory: The ball looks set to go in, but the referee Kevin Friend has already blown for full time

Denied: The ball trickles over the line and would have made the score line 3-1... If only the ref hadn't already blown his whistle

Pleading: Leeds players protest that the goal should stand with referee Kevin Friend but to no avail

Unlucky ticket: The betting slip which shows how agonisingly close the punter was to a perfect set of scores

Leeds players, including Austin, protested vigorously but didn't take their complaints any further having won the tie in any case.

The accumulator bet, which also included Oldham to beat Liverpool 3-2, Celtic to get knocked out of the cup by St Mirren 3-2 and Brentford's 2-2 draw with Chelsea, would have netted the unlucky gambler £506,562 if the goal had gone in.

Not all has been lost however, as he still walked away with £17,055.80 for his 'Lucky 15' bet at Ladbrokes.

Alex Donohue, of Ladbrokes, said: 'The referee has ruined our punter’s dream.

'Seventeen grand is sweet enough but he was literally one second away from having his life changed forever.'

Bookies heralded Sunday’s results as some of the biggest shocks of all time as all three odds-on Premier League favourites failed to win against lower league opposition.

The Lucky 15 bet involved 15, 20p bets on four correct score predictions: four singles, six doubles, four trebles and an accumulator.

They were Brentford 2 Chelsea 2 at 18/1 , Leeds 3 Tottenham 1 (25/1), Oldham 3 Liverpool 2 (80/1), and St Mirren 3 Celtic 2 (50/1).
