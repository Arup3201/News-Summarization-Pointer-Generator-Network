Kim Kardashian does it. Jennifer Lopez does it too. And now Australian women are shelling out up to $3000 to learn how to do it. 

The Kardashians have turned the art of contouring, a technique that involves highlighting and shadowing the face, from a make up insider secret to something many women - and some men - have tried to master.

The demand to learn the secret to a flawless face is so high in Australia that one Hollywood make up artist is in the country this week to teach sold-out workshops in Sydney and Melbourne.

Lilit Caradanian is a professional make up artist with a roster of celebrity clients and over 840,000 Instagram followers.

The 30-year-old was flown here to teach the the techniques used by Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez's 'glam squads' to groups of women who have shelled out up to $3000 each for a three-day master class.

Lilit spoke to Daily Mail Australia during her Sydney workshop, which will be followed this week by more sold-out classes in Melbourne.

Tricks of the trade: Make up artist Lilit Caradanian (pictured) says that '90 per cent' of her students and clients request contouring

'Contouring is really popular over here,' she says. 'I always ask what the class wants to learn and right now contouring is 90 per cent of the feedback I get.

'My students who are make up artists tell me their clients come to them asking about contouring. The average consumer knows about contouring, but doesn’t have the knowledge to do it themselves.'

While the Kardashians are largely responsible for alerting the masses to the magic of contouring, Lilit credits Jennifer Lopez with pioneering the trend - even if her fans didn't know she was doing it at the time.

'JLo – it started with her. Scott Barnes, her former make up artist, created and then became a master of contouring,' Lilit says. 'And then he became Kim’s make up artist, and she started carrying that look as well.'

Before and after: The contouring technique can give the illusion of a different face shape, sculpted jawline and cheekbones 

1. Start with applying your foundation as normal

2. Next take a peach-hued concealer, approximately two shades lighter than your skin and apply under the eyes to highlight, blending as you go

3. Use the same concealer on the straight bridge of the nose, middle of the forehead and centre of the chin (think everywhere the light catches) and blend, blend, blend

4. Next, take a contouring cream two shades darker than your foundation

Sculpt the face: Concealers, highlighters and contouring creams are used

5. Swirl some of the contouring cream onto a brush and start by outlining around the hairline. This should look like you are ‘framing’ the face. Blend the contouring ‘in’ (starting from the outside of the face and blending inwards)

6. Finish the ‘frame’ by sweeping the colour under the jawline.

7. Trace the contour cream below the cheekbones, creating a triangle of colour that points to the corner of the lips

8. Take some more colour and contour on either side of the bridge of the nose and also in the crease of the eyelid

9. The final step is to blend, blend, blend using a foundation brush to ensure there are no firm lines 

Illusion: Contouring can be used to slim a face, hide a double chin, and highlight cheek bones

So, what is contouring exactly? 'It’s not just drawing lines on your face. It’s about bringing out certain features we want and receding features we don’t want to show so much,' Lilit tells DMA. 'If you have a double chin, you can contour it to make you look a little bit slimmer – it’s an illusion. You’re sculpting your features.'

'The ideal shaped face is the oval shape, so if you don’t have that, you can contour your face in certain areas to create the illusion of the oval shape, and to bring out the features.'

Lilit's clients have become savvy about contouring. 

'A few years ago, when I’d ask my clients what they want to do with their make up, they would say they wanted a smoky eye, some liner, lashes. Now it’s just about contour. They don’t care what you do with their eyes or lips, as long as they have contour. 

Pioneer: Jennifer Lopez was an early adopter of contouring

'The bridal industry has taken this turn where the bride wants to feel like a celebrity the day of her wedding - all eyes on them. They want to feel like a Kardashian, they want to feel perfect.'

Celebrities have embraced the art of contouring because it helps them photograph flawlessly. But how does it translate to real life? With heavy duty contouring taking up to an hour, Lilit says there are a few short cut methods that can be adapted for everyday.

'A woman shouldn’t spend longer than 15 minutes getting ready in the morning. You don’t need to highlight and contour every day. 

'A simpler technique is with a powder bronzer, which you can use in the same way as a contour, it’s easier, on the go, and you don’t need to sit there and blend it for an hour. All you really need is some good base – tinted moisturiser or foundation, some bronzer so you don’t look pale, blush, and you’re good to go.

There are a few different contouring methods, says Lilit. 'You can use heavier creams, which are great for photo shoots but not if you want your make up to last all day. There are also thinner, more liquid creams, which have more staying power.'

And for Australia's humid climate, where woman are regularly victims to their carefully applied make up slipping off in the heat, Lilit recommends a powder base. 

'For people with oily skin or if you live in a humid climate, you want to go with powder contouring versus cream contouring,' she advises. 'You’re still going to get the same look, but with a lighter texture and feel on the skin.'
