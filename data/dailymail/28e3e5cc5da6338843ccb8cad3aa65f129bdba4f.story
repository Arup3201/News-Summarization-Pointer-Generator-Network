Their willingness to betray their country to the Soviet Union earned them great notoriety.

But according to their KGB handlers, the Cambridge Five were a bunch of drunkards who could not be relied upon to keep a secret.

The damning assessment of the university spy ring recruited in the 1930s is revealed in the Mitrokhin Archive, a file of top secret Soviet documents  being made available to the public for the first time today.

The file contains profiles of around 200 British KGB collaborators and is highly critical of two of the Cambridge Five, Guy Burgess (left) and Donald Maclean (right)

The file contains profiles of around 200 British KGB collaborators and is highly critical of two of the Cambridge Five, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. 

‘Burgess does not dress tidily and is constantly under the influence of alcohol,’ Russian translator Svetlana Lokhova wrote. ‘Once on his way out of a pub, he managed to drop one of the files of [top secret] documents he had taken from the Foreign Office on the pavement.’

The file says Maclean too went through ‘drunk spells’ and was ‘not very good at keeping secrets’.

During one binge, he told one of his lovers and his brother about his work for the KGB, leaving his paymasters in despair.

Kim Philby was part of the Cambridge Five

The archive was compiled by KGB Major Vasili Mitrokhin, who defected to Britain in 1992 and  contains more than 30 years of Soviet secrets.

The FBI called it the ‘most complete and extensive intelligence ever received from  any source’.

The archive reveals the extent of the betrayal by the Cambridge Five – Communist sympathisers recruited as students by the KGB who rose to senior positions in the Foreign Office and the secret services and passed secrets to Russia throughout the Second World War and Cold War.

As well as Burgess, Maclean and Kim Philby, who all eventually fled to Moscow, they included Anthony Blunt and a fifth man thought to be John Cairncross.

Burgess alone handed over 389 documents to the KGB in the first six months of 1945 and a further 168 in December 1949.

Just before the end of the war, Philby became head of Britain’s anti-Soviet section, meaning that the man charged with running operations against the Kremlin was a KGB agent. 

Mitrokhin – who tried to defect to the U.S., only to find that the CIA did not trust him – walked into the British embassy in Riga, Latvia, in 1992 carrying his archive.

He looked more like a homeless man rather than a senior KGB officer but a young female diplomat saw through his dishevelled appearance and alerted MI6 to his potential before, in typical British style, offering him a cup of tea. 

Agents arrived and started rifling through files buried beneath his dirty underwear in a suitcase. They soon realised that she had secured one of the greatest intelligence hauls in history.

Mitrokhin had spent years secretly compiling his archive after becoming disillusioned with the Soviet regime.

Professor Christopher Andrew, the only historian to be allowed previous access to the files, said: ‘The risks he took reflect the genuine beliefs he held.’

Mitrokhin died in 2004. The papers, which were kept at a secret location until his family released them – with some information redacted – are now at the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge.
