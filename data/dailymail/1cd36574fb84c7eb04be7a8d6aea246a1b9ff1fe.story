Claims: Aurelie Filippetti, 40, France's glamorous Culture and Media Minister alleges that her relationship with Thomas Piketty came to a violent end

His glamorous media image and radical ideas have seen him dubbed the ‘rock star’ economist.

But Thomas Piketty – whose bestselling book, Capital In The Twenty-First Century, has been hailed by Unite union boss Len McCluskey and Ed Miliband’s most trusted adviser, Stewart Wood – is actually a woman beater, a ex-lover has claimed.

Aurelie Filippetti, 40, France’s glamorous Culture and Media Minister, had a relationship with Mr Piketty, 42, which she alleges came to a violent end.

A Socialist Party source, who was 
close to the couple when they shared a flat on Paris’s Left Bank, said:
 ‘Frankly, she views him as a woman beater who used violence as a 
solution to their domestic problems. The details of what Thomas did to 
Aurélie are quite shocking – they drove her to contemplate suicide.

‘Many
 believed the complaints about Thomas were politically motivated, but 
Aurelie herself spoke about them often in private. She was desperate to 
bring Thomas to justice.

‘It was one of the darkest periods of her life.’

Although the pair have both attempted 
to keep their private lives a secret, records show that on February 6, 
2009, Ms Filippetti attended a Paris police station to lodge a complaint
 about an attack.

Soon 
afterwards Mr Piketty was investigated for ‘violence between domestic 
partners’ – a crime that carries a jail sentence of up to 14 years.

At the time, Ms Filippetti was  a spokeswoman for the Socialist Party, then in opposition, which Mr Piketty was also advising on economic policy. Both were close to Segolene Royal, the party’s 2007 presidential candidate and the mother of president Francois Hollande’s four children.

An investigating officer confirmed: ‘The 
complaint was examined very thoroughly. The accuser was in a very 
distressed state on the day she attended the police station and did not 
leave until close to midnight.’

Arrested: Thomas Piketty confirmed he had been arrested and held in custody but disputed the allegations

Police also confirmed  that the accusations included Ms Filippetti ‘having been hit’ and that she had  a medical examination.

Mr Piketty was formally charged on March 17, 2009. But the politician then asked for the charges to be dropped – apparently because she did not want her daughter Clara, now 15, to hear details of the claims.

Mr Piketty – a professor at  the Paris School of Economics – originally described the claims  as ‘stories from the gutter’.

A
 spokesman for Ms Filippetti said: ‘Mr Piketty has recognised the facts 
of the violence against Ms Filippetti  and apologised, so in the 
interests of the families  and children she did  not proceed.’

Last
 night Mr Piketty confirmed he had been arrested and held in custody but
 disputed the allegations: ‘The case closed five years ago. There was no
 factual or legal basis to pursue it.’
