Two major lingerie companies are being sued by two women who say they haven't lost weight after wearing the brands' caffeine-laced fat-busting shapewear.

Maidenform Brands and Wacoal America advertises that the caffeine capsules embedded in the fabric of their intimate apparel helps to 'promote fat destruction'.

But Christine Caramore and Michelle Martin argue those claims are as 'credible as a note from the Tooth Fairy.'

Class action: Two women are suing Maidenform Brand for 'falsely advertising' that caffeine-laced shapewear (pictured) tames curves

The New Yorkers filed a suit in Brooklyn Federal Court earlier this week after wearing the nutrient-infused underwear and not shedding a pound.    

Caramore, the lead plantiff, says the
companies claim 'the fabric is constructed with minerals and nutrients 
that are absorbed by the skin and can permanently change women's body 
shape and skin tone.

'For example, defendant Wacoal claims
that that the shapewear fabric ... is constructed 'with embedded 
microcapsules containing caffeine to promote fat destruction; vitamin E 
to prevent the effects of aging; ceramides to restore and maintain the 
skin's smoothness; and retinol and aloe vera to moisturize and increase 
the firmness of the skin'.

'The Federal Trade Commission calls such claims 'about as credible as a note from the Tooth Fairy'.'

While the 'shapewear fabric' is made by 
Nurel, the Spanish company is not named as a defendant in the suit.

Fat-busting: Lingerie company Maidenform's Instant Slimmer line claims to smooth curves and destroy fat with a microfiber fabric called Novarel Slim, which contains ingredients like caffeine, vitamin E and retinol

The lawsuit also states that the company preyed on women’s insecurities about their body images.

Both women seek class certification, 
restitution, and statutory, treble damages and punitive damages for 
consumer fraud, breach of warranty and unjust enrichment, according to Court House News.

A similar lawsuit was filed in 2012 against Sketchers, when it falsely advertised its footwear could tone the wearer's legs.

The company was forced to pay $40 million in settlement money and issue a massive recall for its shoes.
