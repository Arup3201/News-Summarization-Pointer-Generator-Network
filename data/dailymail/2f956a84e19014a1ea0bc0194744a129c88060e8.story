A previously unpublished letter written by Abraham Lincoln reveals the future president as a ‘nervous’ man not entirely comfortable with his then growing reputation rather than as the iconic American leader that he later became.

The letter, dated March 6, 1860, was written soon after a historic turning point in Lincoln’s life as it was sent just a month after his famous Cooper Union address.

The historic speech given on February 27, 1860, at Cooper Union, in New York City is a key moment that helped catapult Lincoln to the national stage and eventually to becoming the 16th president of the United States.

Yet just a month later, the letter which is postmarked Hartford, Conn., shows Lincoln suffering from doubts and keen to return home to see his family.

In the letter Lincoln declines an invitation to speak, saying that he feels ‘unfit’ to fulfill the obligations and wants to return home.

‘Yours of the 2nd was received late last evening,’ Lincoln writes. ‘I cannot speak in New Jersey this time. I have over staid my time - have heard something about sickness in my family - and really am nervous and unfit to fill my engagement already made here in Connecticut. Will you please excuse me?’

Just four days prior to Lincoln’s letter, J.A. Freeman, secretary of the Republican Executive Committee of Orange, N.J., had written to Lincoln, saying his organization ‘most earnestly and cordially’ requested him to address the Republicans of Orange at his earliest convenience.

‘You have many warm political friends in this place who are very anxious to hear you, and as New Jersey is one of the doubtful states, we wish all the help that we can get from the eminent speakers of the Republican Party,’ Freeman wrote.

‘If you can comply with our request, please let me know upon what evening we may have the pleasure of hearing you, and where in New York you may be found so that some friends can meet and bring you out here.’

Until recently the letter had been in possession of descendants of the Freeman family.

It is now up for sale by The Raab Collection, a Philadelphia-based dealer of historical documents, which has valued it as $40,000.

Lincoln scholar, Harold Holzer, once called the Cooper Union address 'Lincoln's watershed, the event that transformed him from a regional leader into a national phenomenon'

‘It also allows us to see Lincoln at his moment of transition from local politician to national figure and to better understand his own story as a person, not a politician,’ Raab told FoxNews.com.

Lincoln scholar, Harold Holzer, once called the Cooper Union address ‘Lincoln’s watershed, the event that transformed him from a regional leader into a national phenomenon. Here the politician known as frontier debater and chronic jokester introduced a new oratorical style: informed by history, suffused with moral certainty, and marked by lawyerly precision.’
