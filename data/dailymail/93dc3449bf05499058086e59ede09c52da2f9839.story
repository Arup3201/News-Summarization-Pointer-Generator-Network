Neymar and Lionel Messi were among the eight Barcelona players who sat down at La Masia to try out EA Sports' latest FIFA game on Tuesday.

Munir, Dani Alves, Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba, Ivan Rakitic, and Marc Bartra also got involved in a four vs four virtual match-up.

And unsurprisingly, the game which took place was Barcelona vs... Barcelona.

Lionel Messi, Neymar, Andres Iniesta and Javier mascherano are the Barcelona players on the shortlist for the Ballon d'Or. However, despite his impressive season with Liverpool, Suarez did not make the cut following his bite on Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup.

Alves, Messi, Neymar and Munir played with the Catalan giants on FIFA 15 in the traditional home kit, while the remaining players played in the bright yellow away strip.

All the La Liga stars wore their full strips as they took part - along with boots and shinpads - with their Ultimate Team profile picture displayed behind them.

Barca are currently reeling following the 3-1 defeat by rivals Real Madrid in El Clasico on Saturday at the Bernabeu.

However one bright spot was the belated introduction of Luis Suarez, who made his debut and set up Neymar's goal.

Barcelona will hope he, Messi and Neymar can produce some Fantasy Football against Celta Vigo on Saturday.
