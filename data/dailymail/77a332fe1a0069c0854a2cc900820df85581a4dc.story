A tweet from a Ukip Twitter account said the death of Hassan Ali - who was under investigation as part of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal - was 'Karma' 

An official Ukip Twitter account said the death of a police officer under investigation as part of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal was 'Karma'.

The tweet, which was deleted shortly after being posted this afternoon, read: 'South Yorkshire police says PC Hassan Ali who was under investigation in relation to child abuse in Rotherham has died in a car crash KARMA!'.

PC Ali, 44, was under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) after it was alleged he twice asked a victim out on a date. 

Four complaints in total were made against the officer South Yorkshire Police by two members of the public.

But PC Ali was fatally injured after being struck by a car in Darnall, Sheffield at around 10.15pm last Wednesday.

He died with his family at his bedside yesterday morning. 

Ukip blamed volunteers running the page for the tweet.

A spokesman said: 'The UKIP Plymouth account is run by a team of volunteers, and it seems the tweet was made by one of them without permission. 

'Once it was tweeted it was deleted almost immediately. The content of the tweet does not reflect the views of the branch, its candidates or indeed the wider party. The matter is being investigated.'

PC Ali was a neighbourhood policing officer based in Rotherham and had been placed on 'restricted duties', while the IPCC assessed whether to launch a full investigation into him.

The tweet - blamed on Ukip volunteers running the account - was deleted shortly after it was posted this afternoon

Death: PC Ali was fatally injured after being struck by a car in Darnall, Sheffield, last week

One of the complainants, who is now an adult, said PC Ali had first asked her out when she was 17 and then did so again four years later when she was 21.

The woman said the officer had been involved with her case and was aware she had been a victim of sustained abuse between the ages of 14 and 17.

At the time he first asked her on a date, she had a one-year-old son, who had been born after she was made pregnant by her abuser when she was 15.

The woman said the officer's behaviour had been 'inappropriate and totally unprofessional'. 

The nature of the other complaints made against him are not known.

Police, who have made no arrests, say they are not treating his death as suspicious and a source said they believe it was a 'tragic accident'.
