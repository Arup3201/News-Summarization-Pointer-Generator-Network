People whose loved ones fall ill or are disabled should be given paid 'care leave', Andrew Marr's wife has said after she spent months caring for him following his stroke.

Jackie Ashley, who is also a journalist, became the BBC presenter's full-time carer as he battled to recover from a near-fatal stroke in January.

She has joined forces with a charity to demand at least five days a year of emergency leave for family carers who have nowhere else to turn.

The politics presenter took nine months before he was fit enough to return to the airwaves, walking with a cane when he eventually reappeared into public life.

His wife helped him with time-consuming physio exercises, eating three meals a day, driving to hospital appointments, changing shoes and tying laces.

In a Daily Mail column earlier this year, Mr Marr wrote: 'It’s toughest, of course, for the patient, but it’s tough and tiring for the carer too.

'Having helped look after her elderly father before his death last year, Jackie had some idea of the pressures of caring. But neither of us had appreciated what a huge social and political problem has been quietly building up as our population ages.'

More than 6.5 million people are carers in Britain, many of them completely unpaid despite having demanding full-time jobs.

But more than two million have had to give up work to be carers, according to the charity Carers UK, costing the economy £5.3 billion a year.

A staggering 89 per cent of people would back a change in the law for move to be put in place, according to a YouGov poll.

More than half of those polled for the charity (57 per cent) supported a right to paid leave while another 35 per cent supported unpaid leave.

Only one in 25 people were against giving carers the right to time off work.

Ms Ashley, a columnist for The Guardian and a BBC radio presenter, said: 'Just as maternity leave once seemed 
unthinkable but is now widely accepted, so the right to care leave needs
to become part of the pattern of employment.

'Our ageing society means 
that more and more people will become carers, but often only for a 
limited period of time. It is madness that so many carers lose their 
jobs forever.'

The call is being led by Carers UK, which said five days' leave a year should be the minimum legal right, with a public debate on offering longer periods of time off.

Chief executive Heléna Herklots said: 'The millions of people caring for parents with dementia, ill partners or disabled sons and daughters are left using up all their holiday leave, can often become exhausted and many feel forced to give up work altogether.

'This is unsustainable, and families, businesses and the economy will pay an increasing price as growing numbers of stressed workers burn out trying to juggle work and family.'

The charity claimed Britain is falling behind 'care leave' policies in other countries including Germany, Canada, Japan, Australia, France, Italy, the U.S., Belgium, Poland, Ireland, Taiwan and New Zealand.

The call comes as world powers meet for the G8 Dementia Summit today in London.

British workers are only allowed a small amount of 'emergency leave', usually limited to a day or two if a loved one has a crisis.
