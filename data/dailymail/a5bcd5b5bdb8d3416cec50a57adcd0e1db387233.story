Justin Bieber's choice of wardrobe at a national ceremony with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has earned him searing disapproval from the celebrity gossip blogosphere.

Bieber became the target of bloggers' 
wrath after he wore a striped pair of blue overalls - with one side 
deliberately unbuttoned - over a white T-shirt and a backwards 
baseball cap to the Ottawa ceremony, in which Harper awarded Bieber a Diamond 
Jubilee Medal.

The outfit earned him the moniker of 'White Trash Prince' on Gawker.com.

Wardrobe malfunction: Justin Bieber's choice of wardrobe at a national ceremony with Canadian Prime Minister Stepen Harper has earned him searing disapproval from the masses along with the name 'White Trash Prince'

Bieber accessorized with stud earrings, a long silver neck chain and a black 
wide-brimmed baseball hat, which he strategically turned backwards so a small tuft of his golden locks would be visible from the front.

He polished 
off the number with bright neon yellow sneakers.

The medal is given to Canadians who earn achievements abroad and commemorates the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's ascension to the throne.

It's a fairly common honor, as more than 60,000 Canadians will receive it before the end of the year.

Trend-setter? Bieber tweeted, 'I hope you hate my outfit'

Harper's full suit and tie certainly contrasted with Bieber's choice of attire.

In a picture posted to Twitter, Bieber is looking up at Harper while the the prime minister's gaze appears lost on the boy wonder's unbuttoned top - or perhaps it was the bling draped around Bieber's neck that held Harper's gaze.

While he's shaking the Bieb's hand, Harper appears to be smiling slightly. Perhaps he is as amused as the blogosphere is horrified by Bieber's wardrobe fail.

'Was happy to present @justinbieber with
 a Diamond Jubilee Medal today,' Harper wrote in a post to Twitter along with the photo of him shaking Bieber's hand.

Bieber, on the other hand, tweeted a photo of his outfit and wrote: 'I hope you hate my style.'

He also tweeted: 'Overauhls. lol.'

But he later explained that his unusual choice of outfit was simply down to circumstance.

'The pic of me and the Prime Minister
 was taken in a room in the arena where i was performing at that day. I 
walked straight from my meet and greet to him.

'It wasnâ€™t like it was like I was going into his environment we were at a hockey arena.'

In other Bieber news, the pop star's music video for the catchy hit 'Baby' dropped to No. 2 on the list of most watched YouTube videos, according to Billboard.

Taking its place was the ridiculously popular music video for 'Gangnam Style' from South Korean recording artist PSY.

The 'Gangnam Style' video has amassed more than 808 million views since its debut three months ago. In September, the video become the most liked YouTube with nearly 5.3 millions thumbs up.
