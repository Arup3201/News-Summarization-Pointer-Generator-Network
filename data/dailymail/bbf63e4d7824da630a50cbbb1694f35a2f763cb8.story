When Charlie Curtis broke his ankle during a climbing accident, his regular exercise regime hit something of a brick wall.

The 30-year-old director of a London architecture firm watched his physical fitness slip away, along with his body confidence, so as soon as his foot was on the mend he decided to take up an active pastime that wouldn't put undue stress on his healing fibula: swimming.

And just six weeks into his training plan, Charlie has lost 10kg and seen extraordinary results - most noticeably around his middle, where a soft paunch has made way for an enviably tight six-pack.

Charlie gained weight after breaking his ankle and was unhappy with his figure, left, so Speedo helped him get back in shape, and within just six weeks had developed an impressive six-pack through swimming

Charlie was given his watery exercise schedule by Speedo, who helped him rebuild his fitness and regain his physique after the injury.

Former Olympic swimmer and Speedo ambassador Karen Pickering got to work creating him a bespoke swimming programme which involved hitting the pool with her twice a week for 45 minutes , and another couple of times by himself.

Charlie, who cut out alcohol from his otherwise healthy diet but didn't make any other changes, said: 'I can't believe 
how different I look and feel in just six weeks and couldn't be happier.

'I put on a lot of weight when I broke my ankle but since starting the 
swimming training I have dropped from a 36-inch waist to a 32-inch.

My 
friends have all noticed the difference, and I feel so much fitter and 
stronger when carrying out other exercises or even daily activities.'

Charlie's exercise plan involved swimming twice a week for 45 minutes for just six weeks

He told MailOnline: 'I was pretty 
healthy before the accident, so it was more about getting into shape 
again after six months off and a couple of surgeries.

'Swimming isn't normally touted as something that's good for cardio, but I noticed a difference in my fitness after just two weeks. My physio was also really impressed with the progress my leg has made, and three weeks ago I was even able to start running again for the first time. But I still hate running.

'I've kept up the swimming and go at least twice a week. I was so surprised at how effective it was; I'm in he best shape I've been in since university.'

In just six weeks Charlie lost an impressive four inches from around his waist through swimming

Charlie's trainer Karen commented: 
'Swimming is one of the best forms of exercise and it is great to see 
the results on Charlie's physique and well-being.

'There is a big misconception that 
swimming is boring and not that effective, but you can mix it up with 
different equipment to keep things varied and to target specific problem
areas.

'Swimming is 
also great for injury recovery, like in Charlie's case, as the sport has
a high impact on fitness levels but low impact on the joints and can 
target the specific muscles you need to rebuild.'

Charlie's programme included aerobic fitness drills and techniques using swimming equipment to build-up his fitness levels and stamina whilst remaining low impact on his ankle.

He swam twice a week for 45 minutes each time, and undertook core strength and leg exercises supported with kick boards and hydro discs to define his abs and arms andrebuild the strength in his leg.

Sally Polak, Marketing Manager for Speedo UK, said: 'We're passionate about making swimming both effective and fun.

'It's great to see how our Swim Fitness range has helped Charlie achieve his fitness goals after his injury. He has shown what can be achieved in just six weeks - imagine what could happen given a little longer!'
