Cristiano Ronaldo has become increasingly frustrated with life at Real Madrid, and could be interested in a sensational move back to Manchester United, according to the European champions' former president Ramon Calderon.

The news of Cristiano Ronaldo's return to Manchester United will not come as a surprise to MailOnline readers.

Rob Shepherd's Football Grapevine told you on Saturday that Ronaldo is interested in moving back to Old Trafford, but is demanding wages of £500,000-a-week.

Real have started the season poorly, losing two of their first three La Liga matches, and Ronaldo is disappointed at the results and  the sale of key players, such as Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso.

Calderon, the man responsible for taking the Portugal forward to the Bernabeu, told talkSPORT: 'My impression is he is fed up with the policy of the current president [Florentino Perez].'

Cristiano Ronaldo was a regular goalscorer during the second half of his spell at United but has become a machine since he joined Real Madrid 

Sporting Lisbon (2001-03) - 25 games, three goals

Manchester United (2003-09) - 290 games, 117 goals 

Real Madrid (2009-) - 214 games, 229 goals 

'When he came [to Real Madrid] with [Arjen] Robben he thought he would be a good colleague for him in the team [but then he was sold].

'[Gonzalo] Higuain was sold and he didn't like that. Last year he thought it was a mistake to let [Mesut] Ozil leave and the last straw was selling Xabi Alonso and Angel di Maria this summer.'

United are reportedly planning a spectacular offer to lure Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, and Calderon believes a return to Manchester is a distinct possibility. 

Calderon added: 'When I signed him in 2009, I remember he said he was grateful to Manchester United.

'He had a marvellous time there, he likes everything. It is a really great club.' 

The former United star  wants a staggering £500,000-a-week though if he is to re-join his old club. 

He spent six years at Old Trafford before making a world-record £80million move to Real.

For the moment, however, he will look to start Los Blancos' Champions League defence with a win over Basle at the Bernabeu on Tuesday. 

Bale, Ronaldo and their Real Madrid team-mates will hope to recover from Saturday's 2-1 defeat by Atletico
