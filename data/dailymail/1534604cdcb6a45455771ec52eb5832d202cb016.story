A man has been arrested as part of a cold-case investigation into a mother-of-three who was killed while moonlighting as a prostitute.  

Lester Ralph Jones, 63, was on Friday charged with murder, kidnapping and arson in the death of 34-year-old Paige Birgfeld, of Grand Junction, Colorado, who went missing in 2007. 

Birgfeld's remains were found in a dry creek bed in 2012, 30 miles away from where she lived.

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation's cold-case team was assigned the case.

Birgfeld was twice divorced and lived with her three children. Friends knew her as a devoted mother and businesswoman. 

But a 46-page arrest affidavit against Jones also describes her escort service. Authorities say Jones, a longtime suspect, was a client. 

They discovered he had frequently used Birgfeld's out-call service and had arranged meetings with her in the days before she disappeared.  

She was reported missing in July of 2007 and her car was found torched just days later. Her remains were discovered by a hiker in 2012. 

When she vanished her eight-year-old daughter walked into the sheriff's office to inform them she had not come home from work two days earlier.

While selling Pampered Chef kitchen tools and baby slings from her home, Birgfield also ran the escort service Models Inc  

Double life: Birgfeld was twice divorced and lived with her three children. Friends knew her as a devoted mother and businesswoman, but she moonlighted as a prostitute and ran an escort service called Models Inc 

Evidence: The mother's burned out car was found three days after she went missing 

Court records do not list an attorney for him. 

Mesa County Sheriff-elect Matt Lewis told the Denver Post that there is a 'very circumstantial basis to this case,' but feels there is enough evidence showing Jones is Birgfeld's killer. 

He added: 'We believe it at this point we have crossed off the list all the things we needed to do to make an arrest. 

'There's not a significant event as much as this is an exhaustive process we've been going through. We are at the point where we feel we have checked every box that's come before us.'

Discovery: Her remains were found in this dry creek by hikers 30 miles away from where she lived. Her eight-year-old daughter reported Birgfeld missing after she had failed to return from work for two days. Her father Frank, pictured in 2012 stands over it 

Limited signs: When her remains were found, Birgfeld's family said they were unaware of her secret but her father said certain clues, like keeping hold of one of her ex-husband's cars an 'unknown reason, was a clue 

When her remains were found two years ago, her father Frank, then aged 68, remembered his daughter as buoyant and positive.

He said: 'Man, she is, she was very rarely negative. Always looked at things on the bright side. Had a great smile and showed it a lot. And clearly what she liked the most was showing off her kids.'

Mr Birgfeld said he didn't know about his daughter's business: 'Absolutely, we weren't aware of it.'

In retrospect, Ms Birgfeld's father admitted that there were clues to his daughter's secret life, including the fact she kept one of her ex-husband's cars for unknown reasons.

He said: 'That was the car she was using for that purpose. I look back, it's obvious.'
