Sam Allardyce is sweating on the fitness of star striker Diafra Sakho after he came off injured during West Ham’s shock win against Manchester City.

Sakho scored his seventh goal in seven consecutive games and has become such an instant hero at Upton Park that West Ham are ready to offer him an improved contract.

He was substituted to a standing ovation in the last minute and Allardyce later revealed he was struggling with a damaged shoulder.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce admits it is a worry that his leading goalscorer was forced off the field

‘For me, my big worry is that my leading goalscorer came off with a shoulder problem,’ said Allardyce. ‘I just sincerely hope that damage is not severe and that he can carry on because when you have someone who scores six in six [in the league] you can ill afford to lose him and if we lose him that will be a big blow.

Sakho has been sensational since his £3.5million switch from Metz in the summer, and even though he agreed a four-year, £20,000-a-week deal when he joined, co-owner David Sullivan wants to reward his form with a revised contract.

Allardyce was angered, however, when Sergio Aguero escaped a booking for a stamp on Mark Noble.

He said: ‘(Noble) was complaining bitterly about it. If you have a look at it you can make your own mind up. For me it’s a very dangerous tackle.’

City boss Manuel Pellegrini claimed his side had chances to win but paid the price for not matching West Ham in the first half.

He said: ‘In the first half we did not play with enough intensity, I thought they would be more tired in the second half and we would be able to move the ball easier, which we did, but in the end we couldn’t take our chances.’
