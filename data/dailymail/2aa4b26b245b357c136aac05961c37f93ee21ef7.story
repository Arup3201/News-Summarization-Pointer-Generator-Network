With $12,000 cash in his backpack, an early morning motorbike ride to the jewellers and a big smile on his face, Matthew Camp was off to buy his girlfriend a special engagement ring.

But that dream was shattered because unbeknown to him a faulty zip on his bag meant that for miles, his hard earned cash was streaming out behind him.

And for fisherman Matthew Camp, the cash truly was the result of hard work, sweat and sacrifices.

Good intentions: Matthew Camp planned to buy his girlfriend Tabitha Bohn an engagement ring with his recent paycheck from a good season as a scallop fisherman

After days and even weeks away at sea, aboard the scallop boat the FV Nancy Elizabeth, at last the boat had had a big haul. It was a welcome relief in a job which at times brings in nothing at all.

When the ship docked on Sept. 9 in Cape May County, New Jersey, Mr Camp, 32, immediately cashed his check, stuffed the bills into his backpack and headed south on the Garden State Parkway at 8am.

According to Philly.com, it wasn't until he reached Lund's Fisheries, close to his home in Lower Township, that the horror of what had happened hit him. Every hard-earned dollar was gone.

His plans were ruined; he called his girlfriend Tabitha Bohn.

He was 'sick to his stomach' Miss Bohn told Philly.com.

'This season had been good, finally. Last season had been bad and we were at our wits' end. Sometimes he can go out for a month and not even make a paycheck,' she told the news service.

Mr Camp only realised all his hard-earned cash was gone after travelling south on his motorbike along the Garden State Parkway to Lund Fisheries

Mr Camp turned his motorbike around and retraced his tracks searching desperately for his money. Some luck, fortunately, was on his side, as a team of highway workers on a roadside project had scooped up $4,000 and handed it in to police.

But the rest was gone, presumed taken by opportunist motorists.

Mr
Camp, a father-of-four, had received a phone call from a person 
claiming to a driver in a silver Dodge pickup, and claiming they had the
cash, Miss Bohn told Philly.com.

But the couple weren't sure if it was a cruel prank. No money was handed in to the police.

'It can't possibly feel good to spend someone else's hard-earned money,' she said.

His dream was shattered when the $12,000 cash for his scallops, which he stuffed into his backpack, fluttered away in the wind because of a faulty bag zip

As Mr Camp prepared to set off on another long fishing trip, his sister Michelle Godin spoke to the news service, and told them he was angry and embarrassed at what had happened.

She stressed he was a hard-working, honest, family man who has to leave his loved ones for days on end for a dangerous job to make ends meet.

New Jersey State Police have urged people to contact them with information.
