A new service promises to help people with busy schedules stay on top of their exercise routine.

Launched by certified personal trainer Vanessa Martin, SIN Workouts provides clients with a 'concierge' who can book classes for you, provide car service and even join you in the workout to keep you motivated.

But at around $350 a month, not including the cost of the classes, it seems only elite clients with money to spare can afford to indulge in the service.

Teamwork: SIN Workouts promises to help people with busy schedules stay on top of their exercise routine by providing 'concierges' who accompany and motivate you

Ms Martin, who used to work for a company that designed gyms for high-end residential buildings, launched SIN Workouts in New York and has since expanded to Miami, with plans to set up shop in Chicago in the near future.

She admits that her business fills a very specific niche - but that doesn't mean it's short of clients.

'People are like, "You do what for a living?"' she told the New York Times. 'But some people will pay for anything that makes their life easier.'

The 20 'ambassadors' for SIN Workouts, which stands for 'strength in numbers,' are part-personal assistant and part-personal trainer.

For $100, they can greet you at your apartment with coffee and motivate you to get to class. Another $25 will buy you car service to the gym, not including the cost of the ride.

Part of their job is to investigate each fitness studio for you to make your workout as seamless as possible.

'It sounds silly, but it stresses people out to figure out how the lockers work and where the weights are,' explains Ms Martin. 'My job is not to leave people with any little excuse not to work out.'

A team of massage therapists are on hand to provide treatments in the comfort of your own home, and they'll even do your laundry for you while you work out and drop it off when it's done.

One fan of SIN Workouts is Denzel Washington's wife of 31 years Pauletta. 'When you're busy, the last thing you want to do is start figuring out where to go,' she explained. 

'And you don't want to waste your time on a class that isn't good. With Vanessa, that has never happened.'

Not only does SIN make scheduling in a workout a cinch, but it has also been shown to make a drastic difference to the waistline.

Real estate agent Estee Gurwitz said she used to have a personal trainer but soon found that group classes were better for motivating her to work harder.

Since hiring Ms Martin to accompany her to the 'daunting' workout sessions 18 months ago, Ms Gurwitz has dropped an impressive 25lbs. 'She's always like, "Hey, high five," and it's really motivating to be with her,' she added.

Liz Hershfield, who is vice president of sourcing and production for menswear retailer Bonobos, told the New York Times that having someone else coordinate her schedule 'keeps me on the straight and narrow!'

SIN Workout ambassadors can work out with you at home, and now even select hotels are beginning to provide workout concierge services.

The Benjamin in Midtown Manhattan, for instance, recently partnered with SIN to offer hotel guests two levels of workout session - the $75 Sinner or the $175 Sinner Elite, both of which involve a consultation and a workout.

Those who sign up for the Sinner receive wake-up texts and motivational messages from a SIN employee, who also relays feedback from fitness instructors.

With the Sinner Elite, the SIN staff member will attend class with you, making sure you have a towel and water at the ready and nab the best bike or yoga mat in the room.

'There's a lot of commotion when classes change over. If you're a novice, it's daunting and overwhelming, and right from the get-go, it's not a pleasurable experience,' Ms Martin told Lodging Magazine in July. 'We work to eliminate all that stress.'
