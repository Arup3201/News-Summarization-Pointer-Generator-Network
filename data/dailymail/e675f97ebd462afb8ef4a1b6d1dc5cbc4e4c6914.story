Harold Morgan, 85, is expected to have a send off to remember tomorrow after a social media appeal for mourners to attend his funeral went viral

A Facebook appeal for mourners to attend the funeral of an ex Welsh Guardsman has been so successful there are concerns the venue will prove too small.

Harold Morgan, 85, will be remembered at a service in St Tathan Church in St Athan, South Wales, tomorrow.

The church had feared they would struggle to fill a single row of pews at Mr Morgan's funeral.

Oxford-born Mr Morgan, had lived in a care home in Barry for the past 14 years.

The former railwayman died with little known about his family after he spent his final 14 years in a care home in nearby Barry.

Officials said it would be 'horrible' if no-one attended his send-off, so the Reverend Rachel Simpson, the curate who will lead the service, posted a message on the church's Facebook page on Monday.

It said: 'On Thursday November 13, we have the funeral for the late Harold Morgan at 12 noon.

'He lived in Owain Court before moving to a care home in Barry approximately 14 years ago and requested that his funeral be at our church.

'Unfortunately there's been some difficulty tracing next of kin or knowing who his friends were, or if they're still in St Athan.

'If you did know Harold or have any more information, please get in touch or come along to his funeral on Thursday.' 

Twenty four hours after Reverend Simpson posted her plea on the social media site the appeal went viral.

Up to 200 people are now predicted to attend Mr Morgan's funeral - and the only worry now is where to put them all.

The service will have a battalion bugler play the Last Post , while two standard bearers will display regimental flags and around 20 veteran and serving Welsh Guardsman will turn out in full uniform to pay their respects.

Welsh Railway Research Circle enthusiasts, of which Mr Morgan was a founding member, are also planning to attend the farewell service.

Ken Ball, director of the Park Funeral Directors, said: 'Nobody wanted to see an empty church for the service of a man who had done a lot in his life.

'There was a worry that there would be row after row of empty pews with not enough people even to fill the first line.

'But once the appeal appeared on Facebook all that changed. I know there's a bus load of Welsh Guardsman coming for the service and many people have been in touch.

'The phone has been red hot and from what I understand there could be around 200 people attending tomorrow. 

'It could well be there will be more outside the church than in it.'

Colonel Tom Bonas, Regimental Adjutant for 1st Welsh Guards, said: 'There will be 10 to 15 people from the Welsh Guards Association attending the service and up to seven from the battalion.

'This has only cropped up in the last 24 hours so we've not been able to trace his service record yet. 

'I understand Mr Morgan did his national service with the Welsh Guards in the 1940s in Egypt.'

He added: 'We pride ourselves on being a family regiment. We also have a very strong association. Once you don the uniform you become part of that family.'

Others will be attending the service out of a sense of duty towards a former soldier. 

Similar social media campaigns to find mourners for forces veterans have also produced results in recent months.

In April, John Anderson Campbell, believed to have won the Military Cross for his bravery during the British Army's campaign in Burma, died in a care home at the age of 92 with no known friends or family.

However a big crowd turned up for his funeral in Whitley Bay Crematorium following an online appeal.

And last month, hundreds of total strangers turned up in Worcester to pay their last respects to D-Day RAF veteran Denis Man, who died with no surviving family.
