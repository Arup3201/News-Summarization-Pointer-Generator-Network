David Moyes has revealed he has been 'tempted' by offers to return to management and insists he has 'moved on' from his sacking by Manchester United.

Writing in the Sunday Times, the Scot spoke in depth about his Old Trafford departure, arguing that 'gone are the days of long-term planning' at United.

The 51-year-old former Everton manager, who lasted under 10 months at United, also insisted he is 'open-minded' about his future and suggesting that he may have snubbed Premier League interest.

Moyes, who had been linked with jobs at Tottenham and Newcastle, said: 'Since leaving, I have received some very good offers and am tempted by one or two of them.

'I have not closed the door on anything and am open-minded about my next step in management, and whether it will be in the UK or abroad.

'Another possibility is that I may choose to have a break and enjoy watching and observing football throughout the world. What I do know for sure is that I have moved on.'

Moyes resisted the temptation to criticise his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson.

He added: 'I have spoken to Sir Alex Ferguson on several occasions in the past few weeks. We met recently at the LMA dinner in London. I had nothing but support from Sir Alex during my time as manager.'

It's no laughing matter! United were dismal under Moyes, who says there is no 'long-term' strategy at the club
