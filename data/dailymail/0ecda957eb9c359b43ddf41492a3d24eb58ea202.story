Tragedy: Retired nurse Maggie Young died after an agency worker at her care home accidentally spilled tea over her and the wound became infected

An elderly pensioner died from an infected wound after an agency nurse spilled a piping hot cup of tea on her lap at a care home, an inquest heard today.

Retired nurse Maggie Young, 72, was lying in her bed when an agency staff worker accidentally knocked the cup off the edge of her bedside table.

She was rushed to hospital four days after the spill as a doctor feared she may have developed the potentially fatal blood infection septicaemia.

The stench coming from the infection was so bad that medics were forced to clear the ward at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth of other patients, the inquest heard.

Doctors were unable to operate because of her frail condition, and she died two days later on June 20, Portsmouth Coroner's Court heard.

The mother-of-three, who was a retired geriatric nurse, was in poor health after surviving ovarian, skin, and breast cancer. She had two knee replacements and suffered from arthritis.

She was admitted to Beechcroft Manor nursing home in Gosport, Hampshire, in May last year after suffering a fall in her bedroom.

Her widowed husband today admitted his wife of 55 years was nearing the end of her life but claimed the tea spillage was the 'pushing point' which killed her.

Peter Young, 83, told the coroner he visited his wife most days and became concerned after an agency worker told him about the accident on June 13 last year.

He said: 'The pushing point was the tea accident. It was the point she started deteriorating. It took an affect straight away.

'I went to the Matron the following day and she said "oh it’s not that serious. There’s been a report but it’s nothing to worry about" and I believed her.'

It was not until the couple’s daughter Janet discovered the extent of the wound a few days later that Mrs Young was rushed into hospital at night on June 17.

Miss Young cried as she recalled the moment she discovered her mum suffering in bed at the care home.

She said: 'Mum was moaning and groaning like nothing on Earth.

'I pulled a side chair up and pulled her hand away because I wanted to kiss her and I saw her nightie and dressing gown was sticking to her.

'There was a sticking great black mess underneath. It was seeping. I was horrified. I saw it didn’t have a dressing on it.

'I went to see one of the nurses and she said it was just part of her dying and I would have to accept that.

Care home: Mrs Young's family claimed staff at Beechcroft Manor in Hampshire told them the tea incident was 'nothing to worry about' and it was only when her daughter insisted on a doctor that she was taken to hospital

'It was quite shocking. I was not aware of the wound at the time. It was quite horrendous.'

The inquest heard nursing staff were 
reluctant to call an ambulance because Mrs Young had signed a document 
declaring that she did not wish to be taken into hospital.

But her daughter insisted urgent medical care was needed and calls were made for a doctor.

She
said: 'The doctor came and had a good look. He said she had possible 
septicemia and he said "we have to get her to hospital straightaway".

'They (the nurses) said to me she didn’t want to go in, but in my mind I couldn’t imagine her saying that at the time. I just wanted to get her into hospital.'

When they arrived at the hospital, Ms Young told how staff had to clear the ward because of the stench from her mother's wound.

She said: 'The smell was quite horrendous. We were in a corner of the ward. The doctors came out and they were actually quite shocked by the stench and by the wound - the gangrene or whatever it was.

'A surgeon came down and said there was no way of operating because she wouldn’t make it. She went in to her own room and that’s where I stayed for four days and watched her die.'

Miss Young expressed her 'frustration' with the care home staff, adding: 'I want to know what happened. Why did she have to go like that?'

The pathologist who performed a post-mortem examination on Mrs Young’s body concluded she died of sepsis from the abdominal wound.

Too late for treatment: Mrs Young was rushed to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth four days after the tea incident but was too frail for doctors to operate. She died two days later

Dr Judith O’Higgins said a secondary cause of death could have been a combination of Mrs Young’s many ailments, which included heart disease, fibrosis of the lungs, fatty change in the liver and 'extreme inflammation' of the kidneys.

The pathologist agreed the sepsis could have been caused by the tea burns, adding: 'It’s basically an overwhelming infection. The body cannot confine the infection to one area. The infection goes everywhere in the body and the body cannot cope with this infection any longer.

'Eventually there’s what we call multiple organ failure. One by one, all the organs develop malfunctions. It’s very quick.'

She added: 'It looks to me there was a massive deterioration in a very short space of time. There were multiple pre-existing conditions in this case which accelerated this.'

The inquest heard that police investigated Beechcroft Manor, which specialises in caring for terminal ill patients, but found there was no case to answer.

However, Detective Inspector Scott MacKechine told the inquest he had raised concerns that no accident form was filled out at the time of the tea spillage.

Lincoln Brookes, representing Beechcroft Manor, said staff and medics were not sure if the wound was caused by a spill or an existing infection.

Mr Brookes said: 'The nursing home do not know how she got a scald on her. They are treating it as a red patch that started on her stomach.

'They got a doctor straight away. They could not tell at that stage whether it was a scald or an infection.'

No cause of death or verdict has yet been given. The hearing continues and is expected to last four days.
