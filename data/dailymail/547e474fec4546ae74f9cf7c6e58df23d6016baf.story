Manchester City defender Karim Rekik is poised for a return to PSV Eindhoven on loan.

The 6ft 1ins centre back enjoyed a productive loan spell with PSV last season and they are keen to take him back.

Rekik has been pushed down City’s pecking order by the arrival of Eliaquim Mangala from Porto for £32million.

The Dutch youngster joined City’s academy from Feyenoord in 2011.

Staying power: David Silva has become the latest high profile player to sign a contract extension at City

Meanwhile, David Silva is determined to win the Champions League and make Manchester City ‘one of the top teams in the world’ after signing a new five-year deal at the Etihad.

Silva becomes the third player to agree new terms in recent months after Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov committed their futures to the Premier League champions, and Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany are expected to be next.

Silva has won two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup since joining City for £24m from Valencia four years ago. Now the mercurial Spain midfielder wants to conquer Europe.
