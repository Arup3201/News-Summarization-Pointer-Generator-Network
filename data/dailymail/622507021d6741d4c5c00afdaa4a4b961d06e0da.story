With a $700,000 advance and a first run of 200,000 copies, Gov. Cuomo's book turned in dismal first-week figures with less than 1,000 copies sold – but the Ebola quarantines could pick up hisnumbers

Governor Andrew Cuomo is so sure New York health care workers won't mind mandatory Ebola quarantines that he's giving them reading lists – starting with his own poorly selling memoir.

'All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics and Life' sold just 945 hardcover copies during its first week, despite a $700,000 advance from Harper Collins and a first print run of 200,000.

Cuomo, well aware the book has quickly become a punch-line bookstore remainder, worked it into his remarks about Ebola quarantines on Monday – as a joke to soothe the tempers of New York doctors and nurses who have returned from west Africa only to find themselves confined to their apartments for three weeks. 

'I'm asking those people who were in contact with infected people – stay at home for 21 days,' he said.

'We will pay. Enjoy your family. Enjoy your kids. Enjoy your friends. Read a book. Read my book.' 

'You don't have to read my book,' Cuomo added after a comic beat. 'But stay at home for 21 days.'

'All things Possible' has performed so abysmally at the cash register that Amazon.com until Sunday didn't have it listed as a top seller in any of its thousands of book categories.

One accolade emerged Monday morning: The Cuomo volume is ranked #36 among books on leadership. 

But ranked ahead of him are a two-year-old tome titled 'The Anti-Obama Book'; a three-year old remembrance of Chinese dictator Deng Xiaopeng; and a four-year-old treatise by Peggy Noonan titled 'The Case Against Hillary Clinton.'

Science lesson: Cuomo was at a Long Island middle school on Monday to ceremonially receive a statewide report on progress toward education goals

Guffaws aside, Cuomo said he's deadly serious about enforcing a quarantine policy that's more sweeping than what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal government's public health pronouncer, requires.

'I disagree with the CDC,' he told reporters Monday after an appearance at a Long Island middle school. 'At the end of the day, I am the governor of the state of New York. I would rather be, in this situation, a little over-cautious.'

And inconveniencing health care workers for three weeks, he said, 'is greatly outweighed, in my opinion, by the potential risk.'

The policy Gov. Cuomo defended is the same one that got Chris Christie, his counterpart in New Jersey, in hot water over the weekend.

Kaci Hickox, a Maine nurse who returned to the U.S. from western Africa by way of Newark Liberty International Airport found herself in a hospital isolation tent for several days while CDC officials evaluated her symptoms.

She had volunteered to treat Ebola patients there, triggering the first of several conditions that made her subject to increased scrutiny upon her return.

Hickox was released Monday and sent home to Maine at New Jersey taxpayers' expense. But Christie insisted he hadn't backed down.

'I didn't reverse any decision,' he told reporters in Florida, where he was campaigning with Gov. Rick Scott.

'If she was continuing to be ill she would have to stay,' Christie said. 'She hadn't had any symptoms for 24 hours and she tested negative for Ebola so there's no reason to keep her.'

If Hickox had been a New Jerseyan, she would have been permitted to quarantine herself at home. The same policy is now in place in New York, Illinois, and – with some nuanced differences – in Maryland.

'This is going to become a national policy eventually,' Christie said Monday. 'Eventually the CDC will come around.'

Kaci Hickox, a Maine nurse who returned to the U.S. from western Africa by way of Newark, New Jersey, was kept in isolation against her will for several days

No regrets: Christie said Monday in Florida that he put the right policy in place, and denied reports that he took a U-turn to satisfy the White House

Cuomo, too, said he's enforcing the same policy he started out with on Friday. And he denied the Obama administration was leaning on him to come in line with the CDC's more relaxed, voluntary, guidelines.

'There was no pressure from the White House,' he said, 'and as a matter of fact I am in disagreement with the CDC's policy – and I still am in disagreement with the CDC's policy.'

Cuomo also said that public health workers check up on quarantined New Yorkers twice every day at random times.

'You'd better be home when they come,' he warned. 'If you're not home then you've violated the quarantine.'

The governor insisted that for New Yorkers who fall in that category, there are legal measures at his disposal.

'If – if people didn't comply,' he said, 'by law we can mandate it.'
