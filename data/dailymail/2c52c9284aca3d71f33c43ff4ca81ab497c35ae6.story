A man has been left without genitals and with three missing toes after a witch doctor told him that losing his body parts would make him rich.

Chamangeni Zulu, from Malawi, has been hospitalised at Chipata General Hospital in Zambia, near the Malawi border, after he allowed the hyena to eat his manhood.

Mr Zulu told the Times of Zambia yesterday that he was promised by a witch doctor that by sacrificing his body parts he would become rich.

Mr Zulu, from Malawi, said he was told by a witch doctor that if he sacrificed some of his body parts he would become rich

'I met some business persons who told me the best way to become rich was to sacrifice parts of my body,' he told the paper.

At around 4am on Monday last week, the man went into the Zambian bush.

Mr Zulu said: 'I was instructed to be naked and a hyena came to me and started eating my toes and eventually my manhood was eaten.'

Mr Zulu said that the witch doctor did not make it clear that his body parts would be 'lost'.

Yet despite the horrific ordeal, Mr Zulu admitted he was still hopeful of becoming rich.

'Even if I have lost some important parts of my body, I still want to get rich,' he said.

The Malawi man has been living and working in Zambia for the past four months.

Chipata Hospital described the man's condition as stable and said that he had been brought to the hospital by police officers.

The man went into the Zambian bush while he allowed a hyena (not the animal pictured) to attack him. The animal first ate his toes before eating his genitals

In 2012, 50 miles from the same spot in the area of Chadiza, a man was attacked in the country after going out to the toilet in his garden.

Isaac Mwale, 42 said that he saw a black animal which looked like a dog leap at him before it mauled his leg.

After the attack, villagers appealed to the Zambia Wildlife Authority to cull the number of hyenas in the area.

The brutal attack happened in Chapita, a city near the Malawi border in Zambia
