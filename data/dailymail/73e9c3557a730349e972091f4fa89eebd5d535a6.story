Juan Cuadrado has refused to rule out leaving Fiorentina before the close of the transfer window amid interest from Manchester United.

The Colombian winger emerged as a target for Louis van Gaal and Spanish giants Barcelona following a fine season in Serie A and an impressive World Cup campaign.

La Viola boss Vincenzo Montella recently insisted that his star man would not be sold this summer, but the 26-year-old appears to think otherwise.

Not set in stone: Fiorentina's Colombia star Juan Cuadrado could be set for a move to Manchester United

In the spotlight: The winger impressed in last year's Serie A and at the World Cup in Brazil

Asked whether a transfer was a possibility, Cuadrado said: 'My future does not depend on me, there is still time until the market closes, no? I don't know...'

It is believed Fiorentina want upwards of £30million for their star man, but Montella is confident that the former Udinese star will remain at Stadio Artemio Franchi.

'He's been here in the past, he is here now and he will be here in the future,' he told La Nazione.

United hope to wrap up a deal for Real Madrid midfielder Angel Di Maria this week for a fee in excess of £60m.
