Relatives of the passengers lost on board the missing Malaysian Airlines jet today slammed Malaysian authorities for keeping them in the dary over the search.

Family members in Beijing accused the Malaysian delegation in China of 'concealing the truth' and 'making fools' out of the families after they left a meeting without answering questions.

'You can't leave here! We want to know what the reality is!' they shouted in frustration. 'Give us back our loved ones.'

The relatives subsequently released a statement saying they believe they have been 'strung along, kept in the dark and lied to by the Malaysian government.'

'This kind of conduct neglects the lives of all the passengers, shows contempt for all their families, and even more, tramples on the dignity of Chinese people and the Chinese government,' it said.

The statement said the Malaysians had 'disregarded the life of the passengers', adding: 'They have been fooling the families and the people of the whole world.'

More than two-thirds of those on board the missing Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are Chinese. Many of the relatives have been holed up at the massive Lido Hotel in Beijing as they await further information.

The protests and statement came earlier today, before the announcement by Chinese authorities of a second satellite sighting of what appeared to be a large chunk of debris floating in the southern Indian Ocean.

Searches have been concentrated in that area since Australia announced three days ago that it had made a similar satellite sighting in the remote area 1,200 miles south-west of Perth.

Wang Zhen, son of missing artist Wang 
Linshi, said there were questions about why Malaysian authorities had 
provided so much seemingly contradictory information.

He
 said he still has hopes his father can be found alive and is praying 
that the satellite sightings turn out to be false. He and other 
relatives are suspicious about what they are being told by the Malaysian
 side, he added, but are at a loss as to what to do next.

'We
 feel they're hiding something from us,' said Mr Wang, who is filling 
his days attending briefings and watching the news for updates.

For a handful of Chinese families who chose to be flown to Kuala Lumpur to be closer to the heart of search operations, the flow of information has been no more fluid.

On Wednesday, grief erupted into anger when several family members unfurled a protest banner in front of a throng of journalists, demanding the truth from the Malaysian government. The ruckus prompted police to escort the relatives, including a distraught mother, away from the briefing room.

By yesterday, the Chinese families who had been staying at a resort south of Kuala Lumpur had to decamp to another hotel as they were displaced by customers for the upcoming Malaysian Formula One grand prix.

'Tonight all the government could give us was old information. But of course we, the families, want to hear new updates,' Malaysian Hamid Ramlat, the father of a passenger, told reporters after emerging from a briefing on Thursday night.

The protest came before it was revealed that a large piece of floating debris has been spotted in the remote Indian Ocean search zone for missing flight MH370.

Chinese satellites picked up signs of a 'suspicious' object measuring 72ft by 42ft in an area 75 miles west of where Australia reported an earlier sighting of floating debris.
