American drugs company Pfizer walked away from tabling a new £70billion deal for British rival AstraZeneca yesterday, just two hours before the takeover deadline.

The Viagra-maker, which has been stalking its prey for months, has been persistently rebuffed by AstraZeneca, whose boss Pascal Soriot argues the business has ‘attractive prospects’ and is better off on its own.

Pfizer is now blocked from making a renewed assault on Astra for six months, but City experts believe Pfizer is likely to return as soon as this cooling off period expires.

The proposed £55-a-share takeover would have been the largest ever of a UK firm by a foreign company.

Driving
 Pfizer’s ambition was a complex ‘tax inversion’ plan that would have 
seen the American company switch its domicile to Britain, slashing the 
firm’s tax bill.

The deal 
was  criticised by scientists, investors and MPs amid fears it could 
lead to job losses in the crucial life sciences industry.

AstraZeneca
 is now under pressure from shareholders - several of which wanted Astra
 to talk to Pfizer about a deal – to show it can prosper as an 
independent business.

Pfizer said in a statement: 'On 18 
May 2014, Pfizer announced that it had made a final proposal to 
AstraZeneca to make an offer to combine the two companies. Following the
 AstraZeneca board's rejection of the proposal, Pfizer announces that it
 does not intend to make an offer for AstraZeneca.'

Ian
 Read, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer, said: 'We continue to 
believe that our final proposal was compelling and represented full 
value for AstraZeneca based on the information that was available to us.

'As we said from the start, the pursuit of this transaction was a potential enhancement to our existing strategy. We will continue our focus on the execution of our plans, bringing forth new treatments to meet patients' needs and remaining responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital.'

AstraZeneca last week rejected an improved final offer of £69 billion from Viagra maker Pfizer as at least £5 billion too low.

In charge: Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca, said the firm will continue to build momentum as an independent company

That was regarded as putting an end to 
weeks of intensifying rhetoric over a possible deal ahead of a deadline 
today, amid increasing concern over the impact of likely cost-cutting on
 UK jobs and the country's science base.

The rejection met with discontent from some institutional shareholders, though others supported it.

The takeover attempt was formally launched by Pfizer at the end of last month, but hostility to the proposed deal included criticism in some quarters of plans for the newly-merged drugs giant to be redomiciled for tax purposes in the UK while retaining headquarters in New York.

And the U.S. drugs giant faced a fierce grilling by MPs in which its Scottish-born chief executive, Ian Read, admitted jobs were likely to be slashed.

Many in Westminster are still furious at Pfizer three years after the firm closed its world-leading research plant in Sandwich, Kent - the site where Viagra was invented.

Although some jobs were later saved, the 1,500-job cull spelled an end to the careers of many leading scientists.

Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca, said: 'We note Pfizer's confirmation that it no longer intends to make an offer for AstraZeneca.

'We welcome the opportunity to continue building on the momentum we have already demonstrated as an independent company.

'We are fully focused on the delivery of our strategy. We have attractive growth prospects and a rapidly progressing pipeline.

'In the coming months, we anticipate positive newsflow across our core therapeutic areas, which underpins our confidence in the long-term prospects of the business.'

He said the board was grateful to chief executive Pascal Soriot, his management team and to all the company's employees for their dedication and focus over a period of uncertainty.

Pfizer had promised to safeguard British jobs in a takeover, but unions dismissed the promise as 'worthless'

November 2013: U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer approaches British rival AstraZeneca for first time, and the two firms' senior directors agree to have an initial meeting in January

April 28, 2014: The U.S. firm publicly admits for the first time that it has made an offer for its British rival. An initial bid of £58.7billion had been made in January but was rebuffed

Clash: Pfizer boss Ian Read after a grilling by MPs

May 2: Pfizer sweetens the deal, upping the offer to £63billion. Chief executive Ian Read writes to David Cameron promising to keep jobs in Britain - an offer scorned by unions. Astrazeneca - whose shares have already risen to record levels - rejects the bid after just four hours

May 4: Labour leader Ed Miliband accuses the Prime Minister of 'cheerleading' for the takeover and orders for it to be halted

May 6: Business secretary Vince Cable warns politicians are powerless to stop the takeover because British laws are not robust enough to intervene. Questions are raised over Pfizer's tax status as it emerges the firm paid £118million in corporation tax between 2010 and 2012 – but received a whopping £184million in tax credits

May 10: The Unite and GMB unions announce a mass campaign to block to the bid in the same vein as the campaign against Cadbury's takeover by Kraft

May 13: Pfizer's boss faces a grilling by MPs in which he admits jobs would likely be slashed. At the same time Astrazeneca claims vital cancer drugs could be under threat from the takeover

May 18: AstraZeneca rejects a 'final' £69.3billion takeover bid, sending its own share price plummeting

May 26, 5pm: Deadline for Pfizer to make another final firm offer for Astrazeneca or declare its intent not to do so. Pfizer announces it is walking away from the deal and under British law it cannot try again for six months.

Anger: MPs were furious when Pfizer closed its top research plant three years ago in Sandwich, Kent

Mr Johansson said: 'AstraZeneca has a culture of innovation, with science at the heart of everything we do.

'I
 believe this will create significant value for our shareholders, 
employees and patients who will benefit from our life-changing 
medicines.'

Tony Burke, assistant general secretary 
of the union Unite, said: 'Pfizer failed to convince hardly anyone that 
their bid was good for science and would secure skilled jobs and 
manufacturing in the UK.

'There can be no room for complacency though. We expect that there will be renewed pressure on shareholders over the coming months with the likelihood that Pfizer could be back in its attempts to take over AstraZeneca.

'The Government needs to use this time to intervene and put a public interest test in place for proposed takeovers of this size, just as other governments do, such as the French, which has strengthened its powers to act to protect strategic industries.

'AstraZeneca's workforce expects shareholders to stand firm, respect their responsibilities and back the board's long-term strategy.

'The future of vital life sciences in the UK and improvements in health are so much more important than the desire of one company to minimise its tax liabilities and wrangles over drug patents.

'This is why we urge the Government to act responsibly and put in place a framework for a public interest test should Pfizer come back for AstraZeneca.'
