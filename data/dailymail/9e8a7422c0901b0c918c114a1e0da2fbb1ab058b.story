Hotel guests not keen on leaving large concierge tips might want to consider staying at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel - where one member of staff will only ask for a dog biscuit for their service.

Catie Copley, a black labrador who trained as a guide dog before transferring to the hotel in Boston, Massachusetts, is thought to be the world's first canine concierge.

The 68lb dog has been a full-time employee at the hotel for more than ten years – and even has her own email address and business cards.

Trained as a guide dog, Catie was deemed unfit for her first job when diagnosed with eyesight problems

Catie, who will be 13 years old
 this year, originally trained at the Guide Dog 
Association for the Blind, in New York.

However, she was deemed unfit for the job after she was diagnosed with mild eyesight problems in her final visits with the vet.

The dog sought a career change and this came about when the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel hired her as a concierge.

Suzanne Wenz, of the hotel, said: ‘Catie's main job is to make people happy and greet guests in the lobby. 

‘She's an important part of the hotel's team and gets on with her colleagues.’

Catie may prove a more affordable concierge for guests than others - merely asking for a dog biscuit as a tip

The Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel opened in 1912 and employed Catie following a refurbishment in 2004

‘We wanted the hotel to be a home away from home for our guests so we decided to bring Catie in as a concierge,’ Ms Wenz said.

‘What's better than having a dog to welcome you to your stay here?

‘Guests love Catie. In fact, she gets more comments than any other staff member at the hotel.’

The dog has become so popular that guests call three months in advance to book a walk with her

Mr Fallon said of his colleague: 'Catie is the most famous dog in Boston. People recognise her when you take her for a walk - I have been stopped by many passers-by'

The dog has become so popular that guests call three months in advance to book a walk with her. And the best-selling product at the hotel's gift store is a replica toy of Catie.

When Catie's not working at the hotel, she lives with fellow concierge, Joe Fallon, 47.

He said: ‘Catie is the most famous dog in Boston. People recognise her when you take her for a walk - I have been stopped by many passers-by.’

As Catie nears retirement, she has started training a younger model - a three-year-old black labrador named Carly Copley - to take on her job when she leaves.

Ms Wenz said: ‘Carly's learning from the best - she is almost like Catie's PA.’
