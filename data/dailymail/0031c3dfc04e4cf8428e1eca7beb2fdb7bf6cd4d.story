Education Secretary Michael Gove has come under fire from the Lib Dems over funding for new school places

David Cameron was under pressure to intervene in a bitter row between Michael Gove and Nick Clegg last night, amid warnings it is overshadowing the Government’s record on education.

A Whitehall source said the Department for Education had become ‘completely dysfunctional’ following clashes between Mr Gove and his Lib Dem deputy David Laws.

The latest row saw the Lib Dems brand the Education Secretary an ‘ideologically obsessed zealot’ yesterday after it emerged he had transferred £400million from a fund for providing school places into his free schools project.

It follows a clash last week when allies of Mr Gove accused Mr Clegg and Mr Laws of ‘lying’ over funding for their own pet project – free school meals for infant school pupils.

Labour yesterday said parents would be appalled by ministers fighting each other rather than tackling the challenges facing the education system.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: ‘The Education Department is playing party politics between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats when they should be focusing on the education of our young people.’

David Cameron yesterday dismissed the row, but Downing Street is understood to be growing frustrated by the damaging headlines emerging from the department.

A Government source said: ‘The sad thing is we have got a good story to tell on schools and that message is being lost.’

Other insults in the ongoing clashes included a baseless story that David Cameron’s 17-year marriage was on the rocks, allegedly spread by Lib Dems.

Former education aide Dominic Cummings 
branded Mr Clegg ‘self-obsessed, dishonest and revolting’. For his part,
 the Deputy Prime Minister called Mr Cummings a ‘loopy ideologue’.

Lib
 Dem sources leaked details to friendly newspapers yesterday of the 
£400million transfer by Mr Gove at the end of last year. The money from 
the Basic Need fund, which helps councils to increase the number of 
school places, was put towards meeting an £800million overspend in the 
free schools budget.

Lib Dem sources claim the move was opposed by Mr Laws and could jeopardise up to 30,000 new places.

A
 source described the move as ‘nothing short of lunacy’, adding: 
‘Michael Gove is so ideologically obsessed with his free school 
experiment, he’s willing to see children struggle to get suitable school
 places.’

A spokesman for Mr Gove dismissed the claims, pointing out 
that the creation of free schools will create thousands of school 
places.

‘From 2015, funding to councils for new school places will 
rise by more than £200million a year,’ the spokesman said. ‘On top of 
this, investment in free schools will provide tens of thousands of new 
places in areas of need.’

The department split is so severe that 
officials were yesterday unable to give an official statement on the 
issue. It is understood one was vetoed by Mr Laws, leaving both sides to
 brief their versions to the media.

The Lib Dems, who backed free 
schools, have stepped up attacks on Mr Gove and the project after polls 
revealed thousands of teachers have deserted the party for Labour. A major coalition row has erupted over the fate of £400million for extra school places.
