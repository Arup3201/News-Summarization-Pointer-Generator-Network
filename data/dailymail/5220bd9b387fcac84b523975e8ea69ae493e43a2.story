The rotten relationship between Chris Huhne and his youngest son has been laid bare in a series of foul-mouthed texts.

Teenager Peter Huhne sent a string of expletive-filled messages to his MP dad calling him a 'fat piece of s***' and telling him to 'f*** off' when he tried to contact him.

Huhne's son was furious that the former Energy Secretary had forced Vicky Pryce to take his speeding points and had later run off with his PR woman, Carina Trimingham, after a high-profile affair.

The messages, published for the first time today, were sent between Peter and his father in 2010 and 2011.

They showed Huhne's efforts to speak to his son, then 18, and Peter's desperation that his father admit what he had done in the years before today's hearing.

'We all know that you were driving and you put pressure on Mum. Accept it or face the consequences. You’ve told me that was the case. Or will this be another lie?' he said.

Row: The poor relationship between Chris Huhne, outside court today, and his son Peter was made clear in a series of text messages released

Huhne replied: 'I have no intention of sending Mum to Holloway Prison for three months. Dad'

But his son responded: “Are you going to accept your responsibility or do I have to contact the police and tell them what you told me?'

These texts were read to the court and
can be published for the first time in full below following Mr Huhne's 
guilty plea today for perverting the course of justice.

2010

June 21

Peter Huhne: Just tried you, ring back within five.

Later: Pick up, pick up your f***** phone.

PH: I don’t want to speak to you, you disgust me.

Chris Huhne: Hope you are okay, I’m visiting Gran on Saturday, would you like to come?

PH: No I will see her without you.

June 28

CH: Peter, just to say, I’m thinking of you and I love you very much. It would be great to talk to you, Dad.

PH: F*** off.

Huhne had tried to write a letter to his son, again sparking a negative reaction.

July 22

PH:
So nice to see our entire relationship reduced to lies and pleasantries
in that letter. Do you take me for an idiot? The fact you said your 
parents were happier as a result of their divorce was disgusting...

You are the most ghastly man I have ever known. Does it give you pleasure that you have lost most of your friends?

July 30

CH:
I understand that I have really offended you but I hope that the 
passage of time will provide some perspective... I love you and I will 
be there to support you if you ever need it.

PH: You are right - the perspective involves me getting angrier with every day that goes by. You just don’t get it.

December 25

CH: Happy Christmas. Love you, Dad.

PH: Well I hate you, so f*** off.

December 28

CH: Tiger, Have you had any news from St Peter’s yet? Love Dad

No answer

CH: Congratulations, I’m really proud of you, Dad.

No answer

CH: Well I’m proud and I love you, Dad.

PH: Leave me alone, you have no place in my life and no right to be proud. It’s irritating that you don’t seem to take the point. You are such an autistic piece of s***. Don’t contact me again, you make me feel sick.

2011

January 16

CH: I hope you are okay, just to let you know I’m thinking of you lots and love you.

PH: You couldn’t think about anyone but yourself. You are a pathetic loser and a joke. Have fun with your....

February 27

CH: Hope you are okay. Saw a Beckett reference and thought of you in Godot, MI6 used to be full of people who did languages at Oxford. Love you.

May 21

CH: I do hope your exams are going okay, despite everything over the last few weeks. Thinking of you, love you, Dad. PS It’s grandad’s birthday today.

PH: Don’t text me you fat piece of s***.

After allegations had emerged, shortly before Huhne and Pryce were due to be interviewed by police, Peter had another conversation with his father.

May 21

PH: We all know that you were driving and you put pressure on mum. Accept it or face the consequences. You’ve told me that was the case. Or will this be another lie?

CH: I have no intention of sending Mum to Holloway Prison for three months. Dad.

PH: Are you going to accept your responsibility or do I have to contact the police and tell them what you told me?

CH: Discuss it with Mum.

PH: It’s not about her its (sic) about your accepting responsibility to me.

CH: Happy to talk about it with you. Dad.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
