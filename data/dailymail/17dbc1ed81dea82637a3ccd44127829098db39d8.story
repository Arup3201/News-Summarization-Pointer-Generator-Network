A bizarre argument is raging around the imperilled Formula One team Caterham — is their only director, Constantin Cojocar, a Romanian cleaner or a former Steaua Bucharest footballer?

Cojocar was thrown into the limelight on Thursday after Caterham’s 220 staff were locked out of the factory in Leafield, Oxfordshire, their futures uncertain.

The story is based on a row between QPR owner Tony Fernandes and Engavest, a consortium led by former HRT team principal Colin Kolles that seemed to have bought the team from Fernandes in June.

Caterham have been in financial difficulty and administrators have reportedly locked staff out of the building

In a series of claims and counter-claims over the past 48 hours, Engavest said Fernandes had failed to hand over his shares.

Fernandes retorted by saying: ‘There was no legal obligation to transfer the shares to them unless certain conditions — which included paying creditors — were met.

'Those conditions have not been met. Our lawyers have asked Engavest several times to comply with these conditions but they have failed to engage.’

In the same press release, Graham Macdonald, the chief executive of Fernandes’ company, said: ‘I question how anyone who was interested in the future of the business would appoint one of their cleaners — Constantin Cojocar — as the sole director and shareholder of the UK operating company?’

 The administrators, Smith and Williamson, confirmed that Cojocar is a director. But Engvast said they ‘did not appoint Mr Cojocar who, we believe, was a former top footballer for Steaua Bucharest during the 1980s.’

Cojocar did indeed score two goals in eight appearances while on loan at Steaua in the 1987-88 season, and also oversaw the cleaning of the Caterham factory, which is said to smell of dead rodents.

Engavest said in a statement on Thursday night: ‘Every single condition precedent of the sales and purchase agreement for which Engavest was responsible has been met.’

Bernie Ecclestone, F1’s supremo, is trying to bring the sides together, with Caterham struggling to get their cars to Austin, Texas for the next Formula One race on Sunday week.

Tony Fernandes implied on Twitter that he has not been paid by the consortium that bought Caterham from him

 Michael Schumacher has ‘made progress’ according to a doctor who treated him after his ski accident last December. Schumacher was operated on and placed into a coma to reduce the swelling. Jean-Francois Payen said: ‘I have noted some progress. We are on a timescale which goes to three years and we need to be patient.’
