Juan Mata is relishing the chance to play with Ander Herrera at Manchester United.

The midfielders came through Spain's international ranks together and won the European Under 21 Championship in 2011.

Herrera, signed from Athletic Bilbao for £29million in the summer, has featured alongside Mata in all of his eight games for the club this term.

'I think maybe we see the game in the same way,' Mata told ManUtd.com. 

'We are different players but we like to play the same way, which is to try to pass, to assist, to move and to find the gaps in the opposition defence. Ander is a great player and everyone who plays with him enjoys it.'

Ander Herrera has played a pivotal role in United's charge up the Premier League table

United have won their last five Premier League games, including victories at Arsenal and Southampton, which has moved Louis van Gaal's side up to third in the table.

Both Mata and Herrera have played a pivotal role in United's rich vein of form. 

'Winning a very big game, away from home, was very important,' he added. 'That was after winning against Crystal Palace with a late goal and then winning two games in a row at Old Trafford. The confidence has been boosted with these results.'
