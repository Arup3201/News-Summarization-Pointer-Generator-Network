It is one of the most enduring mysteries of the 20th century - the fate of American aviator Amelia Earhart who went missing without a trace over the South Pacific.

Now, 75 years on, efforts to solve the riddle have been given fresh impetus after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the government's support for a new $500,000 hunt to find her plane.

Clinton was due to meet with historians and scientists from The International Group for Historic (IGHAR) Aircraft Recovery today as they make plans for a trip to suspected crash site in July.

Enduring riddle: American avirator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937

Salvage bid: This graphic shows the journey Earhart had intended to make between Papua New Guinea and Howard Island in 1937. Some believe the plane wreck lies off Buka Island, but this latest search will focus on Nikumaroro island, where bones suspected of belonging to the aviator were found in 2010

The wreckage of the Lockheed Electra 
is believed to lie off the remote island of Nikumaroro, in what is now 
the Pacific nation of Kiribati.

Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan
disappeared on July 2, 1937, while travelling from Lae, in New Guinea, 
to Howland Island during her bid to become the first woman to fly around
the world.

The group believes Earhart and Noonan
may have managed to land on the island, then known as Gardner Island, 
and survived for a short time. Other historians believe they crashed into the ocean.

But conspiracy theories, including 
claims that they were U.S. government agents captured by the Japanese 
before World War II, abound despite having been largely debunked.

Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive more than 75 years later

Conspiracy? There have been many theories behind what happened to Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan

Numerous attempts to find the 
wreckage have failed.

Last year, divers in Bougainville, Papua New 
Guinea, said they were convinced they fouind the wreckage on Buka 
Island, some 400 miles from Lae.

But this new search focuses on Nikumaroro, which lies another 1,800 miles further east.

One senior U.S. official said new 
analysis of a contemporary photo of a portion of the island shows what 
some people believe could be a strut and wheel of the plane protruding 
from the water. 

Suspicions were also aroused when IGHAR found bone fragments thought to belong to Earhart on the island in 2010. Though tests to identify them proved inconclusive.

The administration takes no position on the purported evidence and acknowledges there is fierce debate on the subject.

The expedition, a joint public and 
private venture, will coincide with the 75th anniversary of Earhart's 
departure on the ill-fated attempt to become the first woman to fly 
around the world.

Previous visits to the island by the 
group have recovered artifacts that could have belonged to Earhart and 
Noonan and suggest they might have lived for days or weeks after landing
on a reef.

State Department officials say 
Clinton will use Tuesday's event to lend her high profile to the search 
while also lauding Earhart's legacy as a pioneer for women and a model 
of American courage.

She will also note the Obama administration's keen interest in the Pacific.

The 'event will underscore America's 
spirit of adventure and courage, as embodied by Amelia Earhart, and our 
commitment to seizing new opportunities for cooperation with Pacific 
neighbors founded on the United States' long history of engagement in 
the Asia-Pacific region,' the department said in a statement.

The State Department and other U.S. 
government agencies supported Earhart and her goal.

The State Department
obtained flight clearances from the countries in which she stopped and 
coordinated the search effort with foreign governments.

The most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven.

Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for serveral months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island.

A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press.

A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale.

An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip.

The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman fron New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.
