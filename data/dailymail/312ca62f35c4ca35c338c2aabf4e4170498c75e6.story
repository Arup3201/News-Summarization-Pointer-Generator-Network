This is the moment a man pretending to be a taxi driver was pictured prowling the streets of Newcastle before he kidnapped and sexually abused a 20-year-old woman.

Stalking the streets, businessman Mohammed Malik is caught on CCTV picking up a drunk 20-year-old who thought he was a taxi driver.

The victim got into Malik's car near The Gate complex, on Newgate Street, and asked to be taken the short distance to the place in the city centre where she was staying with friends.

Instead Malik drove her to the West End of Newcastle, parked up in a secluded spot and subjected the young woman to a horrific sex attack.

He was snared after three men spotted the woman getting into the car and texted the registration number to police.

Now the 30-year-old of Arthur's Hill, Newcastle, is facing years in prison after a jury at Newcastle Crown Court convicted him of kidnap and sexual assault.

Prosecutor Julian Smith said the 20-year-old victim was a visitor to the city and had been out celebrating a birthday with friends in March when she started looking for a taxi around 4am.

Mr Smith said: 'The complainant found herself drunk and alone, looking for a taxi.

'Unfortunately for her, the car she got into, believing it to be a taxi, was nothing of the sort. She found herself in the defendant's car, who drove her to a secluded area to the west of the city, away from the city centre.

'He took her away under false pretences, he would not let her leave and he then took the opportunity to seriously sexually assault her.'

The court heard the young woman and her friends had been to a number of bars and ended up in a takeaway near The Gate, at which point the 20-year-old left and went looking for a cab.

She was unsuccessful in trying to hail a taxi outside Sinners bar and so started walking towards the Haymarket, up Newgate Street.

Mr Smith said: 'At that point the defendant's car comes into view driving down the road away from the Haymarket and it stops in the lay-by taxi rank outside Debenhams. She approaches him and speaks to him then gets in the car.'

Malik, who manages a number of properties, including a takeaway, drove off with the woman in his VW Golf estate. Three men passing by saw the woman getting into the car, which they noticed was not a taxi.

They made a note of the registration number and texted it to police.

Malik then drove up Elswick Road with the kidnapped woman, parking up in a secluded spot on Bentinck Road, Elswick.

Despite her screams of protest, he pulled her into the back seat by her arms and legs and subjected her to a sexual assault.

It was sometime after Malik's (far left) trip to this shop that he found his victim at a taxi stand

Mr Smith said: 'He would have known she was lost because she told him she was not from round here.

'It lasted some time and eventually, despite having no clue where she was, she told him he made her sick and had the courage to leave the car. She met two drunken good Samaritans who stayed with her.'

Malik then reappeared in his car, acting as if nothing had happened and asking if she was going to get back in. She refused and the passers-by flagged down a genuine taxi to take her back to her friends.

Police were called and when the woman was examined they found bruising to her arms and legs.

Malik was arrested later the same day as a result of his number plate having been sent to the police.

His DNA was also recovered from the victim's clothing. Malik, who had denied kidnap and sexual assault, will be sentenced next month. He was remanded in custody and faces a significant jail term.

Judge John Milford told him: 'Doubtless you have been warned as to the sort of sentence you are likely to receive in terms of years.'
