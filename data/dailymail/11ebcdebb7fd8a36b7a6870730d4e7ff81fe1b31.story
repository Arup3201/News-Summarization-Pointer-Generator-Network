An 107-year-old man in Arkansas was killed yesterday after entering into a gun fight with a SWAT team.

The suspect, 107-year-old Monroe Isadore, had pointed a gun at the two people.

Police ushered out the two victims and Isadore barricaded himself in a room.

When officers tried to get into the room, Isadore shot at the door and so the officers retreated to a safer area.

A SWAT team was then called in and a negotiator tried to speak with Isadore.

When negotiations were unsuccessful, SWAT inserted gas into the room.
