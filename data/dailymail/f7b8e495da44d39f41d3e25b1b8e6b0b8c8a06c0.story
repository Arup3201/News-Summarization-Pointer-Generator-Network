Michael Heseltine said poorer countries like India and China are doing far better than Western states because their poverty means they have more to strive for

The economy is stalling because Britons feel too rich to push for growth, Lord Heseltine has suggested.

The Tory grandee said the wealthier a country becomes, the less ‘national will’ there is to ensure the economy improves.

The peer, who has just returned from a trip to India, said poorer countries like India and China are doing far better than Western states because their poverty means they have more to strive for.

And he made the claim that an economic recovery was not ‘essential’ for the future of the UK.

The former deputy prime minister’s claims invite accusations of being out of touch at a time when millions are struggling to find work.

But, asked in the interview whether it is essential that the economy improves, he said: ‘It’s not essential. It doesn’t need to. It can go on drifting down.

‘There is no God-given rule saying you’ve got to have a well-performing economy. It could be an indifferent economy.

‘It’s a question of whether the national will is there; whether we want it. And the richer you get the less imperative there is.

‘Maybe one of the problems of advanced economies is that people are sufficiently well-off they don’t need to drive themselves any more.

‘All these comparisons with China and India are ridiculous. I’ve just come back from India. You know why they’ve got to drive themselves – they’ve got real problems.

‘While in this country there are people with problems, the vast majority of people have standards which are not comparable with the Third World.’

Asked whether the problem is lack of desire to see growth, he told the Independent newspaper: ‘It could be. I don’t personally subscribe to that view but I don’t discount it as a possible thought.

Lord Heseltine said poverty stricken countries like India strive to drive their economy forward because they have 'real problems'

‘I think that there is in the nature of most people a desire to do something and to do it better, and do it to a degree of personal satisfaction.’

Lord Heseltine has just completed a report for the Coalition Government into how to promote growth in the economy.  Last week the Treasury backed most of the recommendations.

Deputy prime minister from 1995 to 1997 under John Major, Lord Heseltine is most remembered for his tussles with the previous prime minister Margaret Thatcher.

He resigned from her cabinet in 1986 in a disagreement called the ‘Westland affair’ which centred on the fate of the Westland helicopter company. Four years later his challenge to Lady Thatcher’s leadership ended with her resignation.

In the early 1980s he helped regenerate Merseyside after the Toxteth riots, and in the early 1990s he was asked by Mr Major to dismantle the hated poll tax.
