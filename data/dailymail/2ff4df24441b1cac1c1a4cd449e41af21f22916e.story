Andrew Woodhouse, 44, was today on trial accused of assaulting two raiders he found stealing diesel from his business

A businessman who attacked two thieves caught red-handed in a night-time raid was arrested after defending his property, a court has heard.

Andrew Woodhouse, 44, was today on trial facing assault charges on the two raiders he found stealing diesel from his business.

A jury heard how Woodhouse grabbed a fence post one was carrying as a weapon - and used it to fight back against them.

The father-of-five - who says he has repeatedly been a victim of crime at his gardening company - kept hold of the two burglars until police arrived.

But the court was told it was Woodhouse who was then arrested and accused of using excessive force.

The thieves ended up with £75 fines - but businessman Woodhouse could face a prison sentence if he is found guilty of attacking them.

Defence lawyer Andrew Taylor said: 'These thieves thought they would have nice easy pickings that night.

'Many people would have given up and just claimed on their insurance but Mr Woodhouse is made of sterner stuff.

'He showed stoicism, courage and fitness to chase them. One of the men was armed and went to attack him. He acted in lawful self-defence.

'He agrees the red mist came down which you can understand when his business has almost been wiped out by crime.

'If it hadn’t been for him these men 
would not have been caught. Where are we in society when a person cannot
 act in self-defence to protect his property. That is what Mr Woodhouse 
was doing.'

Woodhouse chased Kevin Green (left) and left him with two broken legs and a broken arm, the court heard. He then allegedly rugby-tackled Timothy Cross (right) and lay on top of him until police arrived

Kevin Green, 53, and Timothy Cross, 32, tried to escape into a neighbouring field with jerry cans full of stolen fuel, the court heard.

But Woodhouse chased Green - and caught him near their getaway car. The court heard he then attacked Green leaving him with two broken legs and a broken arm.

The court heard he then chased Cross before rugby-tackling him. He lay on top of the raider until police arrived.

Prosecutor James Wilson said: 'When he saw his hard-earned money carted off by a couple of ne’er-do-wells, he gave chase in anger intending to injure them.'

Mr Wilson described it an 'unreasonable and unlawful assault.'

He said: 'It was not reasonable self-defence. Mr Woodhouse lost his temper and went over the top.

Woodhouse denies grievous bodily harm and grievous bodily harm with intent

'He is a hard-working businessman but he has let his frustration get the better of him. He lost it.'

The court heard how Woodhouse gave police a full account of how he fought with the two raiders like a 'mad man'.

He said: 'I swore at the men and grabbed one of them, I then felt a blow to my hand and shoulder and began grappling with them.

'If it hadn’t been for him these men 
would not have been caught. Where are we in society when a person cannot
 act in self-defence to protect his property. That is what Mr Woodhouse 
was doing'

'I was pushed over and then I grabbed something from one of their hands which felt like a wooden fence post.

'I didn’t want to be on the floor with someone hitting me with the wood like that.

'I swung out like a mad man between six and ten times. I was just lashing out man, I was hitting as hard as I could.'

Woodhouse said he was 'gutted and sickened' to learn the extent of Green’s injuries.

Woodhouse was woken in the middle of the night by a text message telling him a burglar alarm had gone off at the tyre yard where he runs his business.

Married Woodhouse was in bed with his wife Lisa at their detached home in the village of Govilon, near Abergavenny, when his burglar alarm went off at about 12.30am.

Green and Cross (pictured) were charged with theft and later given £75 fines by magistrates

The alarm is fitted to his business premises on an industrial estate a mile from his six-bedroom £350,000 home.

Woodhouse drove to the premises where he disturbed two men stealing diesel from his machinery.

A court heard how his wife drove to the scene to help him and she called the police to come and arrest the thieves.

She told the court: 'I knew something was wrong when he didn’t ring me after leaving the house.

'When I drove there myself, I saw him lying on the floor with the second chap. He was holding him and shouting at me to ring the police.'

The court heard officers found Green lying injured under a blanket - and Cross claiming the businessmen had gone 'over the top'.

PC Aime McSherry said: 'I asked him what happened.

'He said: “I been nicking diesel and some bloke has beaten me up with a stick and broken my legs and my arm. I need an ambulance”.'

Green claimed he was left in 'terrible pain' - and that Woodhouse kicked him in the ribs and punched him in the face.

The court heard he is still using crutches ten months after the incident in March last year.

Woodhouse employs six staff including two of his sons at the family business, which was set up 20 years ago.

He had been targeted by thieves in recent years who took between £15,000 and £25,000 of machinery.

The court heard how he didn’t feel like officers had given him enough assistance when he had been the victim of crime.

Green and Cross were charged with theft and later given £75 fines by magistrates.

Woodhouse denies grievous bodily harm and grievous bodily harm with intent.

The trial at Cardiff Crown Court continues.
