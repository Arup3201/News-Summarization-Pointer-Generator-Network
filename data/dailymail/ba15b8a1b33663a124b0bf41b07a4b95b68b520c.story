Nathan Jones will again be in charge of Brighton when they head to Fulham on Monday night.

The former Seagulls defender was named interim boss in the wake of Sami Hyypia's departure just before Christmas and watched his side come back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Reading on Boxing Day.

Brighton have already held talks with some of the candidates on their shortlist to succeed Hyypia, with Tony Pulis and Chris Hughton reportedly the frontrunners.

In the meantime Jones, who was assistant to Hyypia and his predecessor Oscar Garcia, says he has no ambitions to land the top job on a permanent basis.

'What happens now is up to the board and the chairman to decide,' he said. 'I will plan for training and Fulham, until I hear otherwise from the board then that is what will happen.

'I have got no personal ambitions with regards to the situation here, but I am very proud to be employed by Brighton & Hove Albion.'

Former Premier League bosses Chris Hughton and Tony Pulis have been linked with the vacant role

Former Cottagers striker Darren Bent is set to miss the trip to Craven Cottage, the final game of his month-long loan deal from Aston Villa, with a groin injury.

Fulham have already changed managers this season to good effect with Kit Symons guiding them away from the foot of the Sky Bet Championship table following Felix Magath's ill-fated spell in charge.

Symons now has one eye on the January transfer market as they bid to make a belated run towards the play-off spots.

'I think there will be a couple of new, fresh faces coming in certainly,' he said.

'It's whether in the market there is the right player available, and for the right place. We're constantly looking and we aim to do so.'

Fulham will be without defender Tim Hoogland, who has undergone a hernia operation.
