Michael Keaton's Birdman won the Producers Guild of America award for Outstanding Producer of a Motion Picture.

The movie starring Keaton, Ed Norton and Emma Stone beat off competition from nine other films, including Boyhood and The Grand Budapest Hotel, to claim the coveted award, which is seen as a strong indicator to the destination of Oscar awards.

Alejandro G. Iñárritu, who directed the movie, said: 'On behalf of all of us, our only ambition was to make a risky and experimental exploration of the cinematic language, of an artist's complexity played by the incredible Michael Keaton.

'I feel humbled by this. All the films that are nominated have such an individual voice, the expression behind them, only the people who made them, could have made them."

The success of Birdman is considered meaningful in regards to the Oscars, as the Producers Guild of America's 6,700 members are also Oscar voters.

In fact, the winner of the top Producers Guild of America award has gone on to win Best Picture at the Oscars every year since 2007.

Meanwhile, The Lego Movie was named Best Animated Feature, even though it has not been nominated in that category at the Academy Awards.
