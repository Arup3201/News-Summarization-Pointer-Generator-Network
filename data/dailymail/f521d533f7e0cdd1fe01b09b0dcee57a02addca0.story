Australia's most decorated soldier has revealed he supports the Australian government's expected decision to join the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq.

Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith told the Sunday Times that the terrorists group's publicised beheadings clarified that they 'don't deserve to share the Earth with the rest of humanity'.

'All that does for me is reaffirm my belief in what we've been doing is the right thing to do because the actions of these individuals is inhumane and they probably don't deserve to share the Earth with the rest of humanity,' Cpl Roberts-Smith said.

He also stated that he believes 'what we've been doing is the right thing to do,' regarding the government's response to the terrorist group

'If you look at the language being used by pretty much every other country on Earth, I don't think they're going to be around much longer.'

The SAS veteran was awarded the Victorian Cross in 2010 for his actions in the Afghanistan war

The Perth born SAS veteran fought in Afghanistan on six separate occasions.

It was for his brave efforts in his fifth tour in 2010 that he was awarded the Victorian Cross after sacrificing his own safety for his endangered fellow soldiers.

'Here he took part in an assault against an enemy fortification, exposing his own position in order to draw fire away from members of his patrol who were pinned down,' the Australian War Memorial website states.

'Fighting at close range, he stormed two enemy machine-gun posts and silenced them.' 

The father-of-two has since retired from his military career and is back at university studying a Master of Business Administration.

However Cpl Roberts-Smith remains a deeply respected figure of the Australian military and was a key figure in the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of Anzac Day, earlier this year.

He was one of three Victorian Cross winners who launched the Anzac Flame's tour around the country before it is expected to feature as a centrepiece at Camp Gallipoli next April.
