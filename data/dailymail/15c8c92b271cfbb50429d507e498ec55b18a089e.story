A police dog has rescued a missing two-year-old girl a day after she wandered from her home in the bitter cold.

Brooklyn Lilly walked up to the German shepherd as it approached her in a wooded area close to her home in Tawas City, Michigan around noon on Thursday, WNEM reported.

The officer with the dog, assistant fire chief Jeffery Seyfried, wrapped up the cold and wet little girl in a sweater and carried her out of the woods, where she grinned for a photograph.

Brooklyn suffered a scrape to her nose, blisters to her feet and was missing a boot but was otherwise happy and well when she was taken to be checked out at a local hospital.

Safe: Brooklyn Lilly is grins after she was found in a woods near to her home by a police dog. She wandered away from her  home on Wednesday and was found 22 hours later with just a scrape to her nose

'It was a rough night, but the moment that she was found was something special,' Seyfried told Mlive.

'She was bundled up in her jacket and when the team walked up to her, she started giggling. She actually told one of the guys that she loved it in the woods.'

Brooklyn was last seen around 2.20pm on Wednesday when she somehow got out of her family's home while she was being looked after by a relative and wandered away.

Authorities launched a massive search on foot and from the air, but police said they feared the worst as she had still not been found by nightfall, when temperatures plunged to 39F (3.8C).

Fears: Brooklyn, left, was out in temperatures nearer freezing but survived overnight and was found by assistant fire chief Jeffery Seyfried, pictured right, an the dog from the Michigan State Police's K-9 unit

Heroic: The dog has not been named but was one of the 40 dogs working for the Michigan State Police, like the dog pictured above. As it looked for Brooklyn, the girl - who has grown up with dogs - approached it

'With this type of weather and with this type of length of time, it was hinging on not good,' Iosco County Sheriff Al MacGregor told WNEM. 'We're very happy of the outcome of this.' 

Brooklyn had walked through a creek and was wet from the waist down when she was found three-quarters of a mile from her home, WNEM reported.

Her mother, Tricia Cook, said that she had 'one strong little girl' and told the channel that the toddler has been enjoying a lot of pudding since she was found.

The girl's aunt, Alecia Cook, added: 'It's amazing. We really didn't think it would happen. After searching for however long they've been out here it's just amazing that she's still healthy and OK.'

The dog who helped find the toddler has not been identified but was one of 40 dogs in the state's K-9 unit. 

Scene: Troopers are pictured looking for Brooklyn before she was found miraculously safe and well

Relief: Search teams walk the search route on Thursday afternoon after she was found and taken to hospital

Saginaw police officer Douglas Stacer, who works closely with K-9 officers, said the bond between man and his dog made them a successful searching team.

'We read off each other,' he said. We've trained together, we live together, it's a partnership most people will never know. I know what he's thinking, he know's what I'm thinking,'

Tawas City is in Iosco County, about 130 miles north of Detroit.
