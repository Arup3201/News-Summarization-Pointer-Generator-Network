While some husbands get scolded for leaving up the toilet seat, this Queensland snake catcher made a rather more substantial slip up: neglecting to tell his wife there was a 1.5 metre python in the family car.

Sunshine Coast Snake Catcher's Richie Gilbert left the sizeable serpent bagged in the boot of the vehicle, but when it  slithered into the dashboard he failed to remove the beast.

When his wife Nat took the car out to meet some friends on Tuesday, she was met with a black and green python poking out from under the steering wheel.

'Naturally she wasn't thrilled,' Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia.

'I didn't want to scare her, and it was lodged into the dashboard. It had already been in there for three days of  trying to get it out. I figured it would stay put for one more night. I guess that's the way it goes,' he said.

'She rung me at 11.30, on her way back from a night out, and told me to get out there right now and get rid of it. She left the car there until the following morning.'

Dinner time: While he was diligent in bagging venomous snakes, Gilbert said he sometimes dropped the ball with non-poisonous breeds like the python

Gilbert said he was bogged down from the peak season, which has seen a surge of business over the summer months.

While he was diligent in bagging venomous snakes, Gilbert said he sometimes dropped the ball with non-poisonous breeds like the python.

'I'll be sure to be more careful from now on.'

He assured Daily Mail Australia that Nat has forgiven him for the blunder, even if there was still some pampering in order.
