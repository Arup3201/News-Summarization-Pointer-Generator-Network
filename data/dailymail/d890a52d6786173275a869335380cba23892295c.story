Referendum vote: Mr Cameron will allow Ministers a free vote next week when Eurosceptics force a vote on the failure to include legislation on an EU referendum in the Queen's speech

David Cameron is allowing senior Cabinet ministers to back an EU referendum Bill and vote against the Queen’s Speech.

Eurosceptic MPs will next week force a vote condemning the Queen’s Speech for failing to include legislation on a referendum.

The Prime Minister will be on a visit to the US but he has given colleagues a free vote on the issue.

Eurosceptic ministers including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, and even Foreign Secretary William Hague, are among at least 100 Conservatives who may support the move, sources said.

Labour leader Ed Miliband will today announce that Labour will not back an in/out referendum on Europe, in a move that will dash the hopes of many of his own MPs who think he should match Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold a referendum after the next election.

In a reference to UKIP leader Nigel Farage, he will accuse Mr Cameron of trying to ‘out-Farage Farage on Britain’s membership of the European Union’.

He will say that the Prime Minister is ‘wrong’ to have announced that an in/out referendum will take place and will insist that Britain must stay in the EU.

Although Mr Cameron is said to be ‘relaxed’ about next week’s vote, it will be unprecedented for members of the Cabinet to criticise the Queen’s Speech, which they are responsible for writing, in a parliamentary vote.

The situation has come about because the Coalition cannot bring forward a Bill to reinforce Mr Cameron’s pledge of a referendum in late 2017 or early 2018 after a renegotiation of Britain’s membership, since it is not supported by the Lib Dems.

But Tory Eurosceptics believe the party should underscore the commitment by attempting to introduce legislation, even if it is voted down by the Lib Dems and Labour.

Vote: Iain Duncan Smith and William Hague are among 100 Tory MPs expected to support the move next week

They have tabled an amendment that states that the Commons ‘respectfully regrets that an EU referendum bill was not included in the Queen’s Speech’. Though next week’s vote will be largely symbolic, it is expected to be followed by a Bill tabled by backbenchers. Downing Street sources indicated that MPs and ministers may be allowed to vote in favour of that as well.

TV presenter Des Lynam (pictured) threw his weight behind UKIP yesterday and said he had penned a song to celebrate.

The former Grandstand host revealed he voted for the Eurosceptic party in last week’s local elections, although he admitted it was an act of protest.

And – in a tongue-in-cheek reference to Ken Clarke’s description of UKIP candidates as clowns – he rewrote the lyrics to the Stephen Sondheim classic Send In The Clowns.

Mr Lynam’s new lyrics include the verse: ‘We used to be rich / Now we are not / But here at last there’s a chance / To stop all the rot / Send in the clowns.’

His backing is another boost for UKIP, which received around a quarter of the vote.  UKIP leader Nigel Farage pledged to lead a rendition of Mr Lynam’s song at the party’s next conference.

And it is thought the Prime Minister might vote himself in favour of a private member’s Bill on the issue which is expected to be unveiled within weeks, though it stands no chance of becoming law without Labour and Lib Dem support.

London Mayor Boris Johnson, Mr Cameron’s chief rival, yesterday said the Prime Minister’s approach was ‘completely right’.

He said: ‘What we need to do is to say to our friends and partners: “Listen chums, this thing isn’t working for either of us”.

‘We need a renegotiation. We need to look at the way the thing is managed.’

The London Mayor said he would only vote to stay in the EU if there was a ‘substantial improvement’ when Britain renegotiates its relationship with Europe.

‘If you get rid of a lot of the barnacles that have accreted around business thanks to European Union regulation and legislation over the last 30 or 40 years, then I’d be content to stay in the single market.

‘But if not, then we should be absolutely clear that we’ve got to be ready to walk away.’

Tory MP Philip Hollobone said that ‘a very large number’ of MPs would support next week’s EU referendum amendment to the Queen’s Speech.

‘There are 81 Conservative MPs who rebelled on the EU referendum issue last time. I wouldn’t be surprised if the number is in excess of 100,’ he said. ‘The Prime Minister is making it quite clear that he wants to have a referendum by the end of 2017, provided he wins. We have to hold his feet to the flames to make sure that comes about.’

Bill Cash, chairman of the European scrutiny committee, said: ‘We need a referendum this side of the general election.’
