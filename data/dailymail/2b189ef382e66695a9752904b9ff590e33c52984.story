In Wolf  Hall he plays the supreme man of reason, Thomas Cromwell. But today actor Mark Rylance reveals that he has a far more superstitious side offscreen.

The star confesses that he turned to the roll of the dice and an ancient Chinese divination technique to make decisions over his career – and credits the advice it gave for his 22-year marriage.

In an interview with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, Rylance says he ‘asked’ the 3,000-year-old ‘I Ching’ book for guidance in 1987 when he couldn’t choose between a career at the National Theatre and a part in Steven Spielberg’s film Empire Of The Sun.

Mark Rylance, who plays Thomas Cromwell admitted that he is very superstitious while off screen 

He said: ‘I turned to the I Ching and you just ask it “Where now?”

‘And it gives an answer. The answer it gave if I went to the theatre was community and that swayed it for me. I had never experienced community on film sets... And it was because of that decision I met my wife Claire.’ She was musical director at the theatre at the time.

Believers in I Ching – or ‘Book of Changes’ – solve problems in their lives by putting the result of dice throws into a hexagram, which can be looked up in the ancient text for meaning.

In the interview, which airs at 11.15am today, Rylance talks candidly about his belief in fate, saying: ‘I think there is evidence for consciousness that is not limited by our physical nature.’

Rylance, who could not speak properly until he was six, was the first artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre.
