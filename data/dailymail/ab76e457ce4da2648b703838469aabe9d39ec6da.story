It is the night that millions have been waiting for with excitement... and trepidation.

England’s footballers play their first game of the World Cup tonight in front of a global TV audience of three billion, 20million of them in the UK.

Perfect barbecue weather is forecast for much of the country ahead of the match in which Roy Hodgson’s boys will take on Italy in Brazil.

Gearing up: England fans preparing for the match yesterday outside the opera house in Manaus, Brazil

Retailers are expecting a £1billion  spending bonanza from sales of TVs,  football shirts, bunting, flags, party  food and drink.

But there are also fears that the tournament could lead to ugly scenes in some town centres thanks to a controversial decision to extend pub opening hours.

A third of those planning to watch the game in the UK are expected to be in a pub or bar, and police and paramedics are braced for a rise in alcohol-fuelled violence.

They point to a potentially toxic mix of warm weather and the fact that the Government has allowed pubs to open late to cater for the 11pm kick off. One leading medical figure, Dr Clifford Mann, said the decision ‘makes no sense’.

Thousands of extra police officers are being deployed around the country as forces put on extra patrols to clamp down on drunken thuggish behaviour.

The London Ambulance Service plans to run special ‘booze buses’ – which look similar to mini-vans – that can accommodate six drunks at a time. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it is treating tonight like a ‘mini New Year’.

Licensing laws are being relaxed during England’s World Cup matches after a personal intervention from the Prime Minister, so every pub and bar is free to open late without having to apply for a special licence.

Dr Mann, president of the College of 
Emergency Medicine, called it an unwelcome move which was likely to lead
 to violence and abusive behaviour.

The flag of St George will fly over 10 Downing Street for England’s World Cup matches, in a show of support for Roy Hodgson’s team.

Although the gesture is well-intentioned, Steven Gerrard and company may not welcome the prime ministerial endorsement – for they could now be struck by the Curse of Cameron.

The PM, who visited the England team at their Staffordshire training base before they left for Brazil, has been blamed for jinxing Andy Murray, Tom Daley and a string of other sportsmen and women with good luck messages during his time in office.

In an article in the BMJ he said: ‘The consequences of alcohol abuse are seen daily in the country’s emergency departments and manifest themselves as injuries, as well as acute and chronic illnesses.

‘This temporary relaxation of the licensing laws... sets a precedent that those with vested interests can use to encourage the exception to become the norm.

‘Those vested interests... must not be allowed to peddle the notion that sporting events are best enjoyed with alcohol.’

Retailers, however, were hoping to do even better than the last World Cup in South Africa in 2010, not least because of greater consumer confidence in the improving economy. Sales of widescreen TVs at Tesco have almost doubled ahead of the event.

More than 5,000 diehard England fans have travelled to the steamy Amazonian city of Manaus for tonight’s game. They have been asked to pay between £300 and £500 a night for basic hotel rooms that would normally cost just £40.

Hundreds more stayed in Rio and gathered on Copacabana beach. England’s players have been training at Manaus’s 46,000 capacity Arena da Amazonia stadium in 80F heat and 84 per cent humidity.

Incredibly last night there were still finishing touches being put to a stadium that should have been completed and tested more than a year ago.

Hodgson’s team are among the tournament’s underdogs. But their millions of fans back home will be praying they make it through  the group to at least the quarter-finals of the competition England have not won since the glory days of 1966.
