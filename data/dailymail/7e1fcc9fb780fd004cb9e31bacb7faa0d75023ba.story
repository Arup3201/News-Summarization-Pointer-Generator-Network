A 14-year-old girl who went missing on Sunday has been found more than 120 miles from her California home with a 24-year-old man she met online.

Leah Kritzer was found in San Diego on Thursday evening, a few hours after police released a picture of her posing for a selfie with the man she was believed to have left with.

A woman contacted police after seeing the picture, and told them a girl fitting Leah's description had been staying in her house.

The man Leah was found with, who has not
 been identified, told police he had met the teenager on an online 
dating website, and believed she was 19.

He claimed he had driven to Manhattan Beach, where Leah lives, to meet her on Sunday after they connected online. 

Detective Michael Rosenberger told Mail Online Leah had established profiles for herself on dating websites.

He added that the case was complicated, saying: 'It wasn't a case of a stranger in a van grabbing someone.'

It is not the first time the 14-year-old has run away to meet strangers from the Internet. In January, police found her at a motel after she disappeared from home to meet someone.

Leah's family feared she had been abducted after discovering she had been posing as a 19-year-old online.

After she disappeared on Sunday afternoon, her parents, Joe and Anne Kritzer, found a number they didn't recognize on her cell phone, which she had left behind.

Missing: Leah Kritzer's parents had feared the worse when their daughter disappeared while walking the dog

When they called it a 19-year-old man answered, and said he had arranged to meet their daughter after speaking online, but left when he realized she had lied about her age.

The couple first realized their daughter had gone missing again on Sunday when a woman called to say she had found the family dog Leah was supposed to be walking, wandering loose.

'There was our dog with the leash on and our daughter wasn’t there and she hasn’t come home since,' Mr Kritzer told KTLA 5, as he tried to hold back his tears during an interview earlier this week.

A
 friend later claimed to have seen the teenager walking back towards her house
 with an unknown man and her dog, shortly before she was reported 
missing.

Concerns: Leah's parents found she had been using online chat rooms to arrange to meet older men

Detective Sergeant Paul Ford told Mail Online earlier this week that the police police department had been checking her activity on social media accounts to see who she had been 
talking to and whether she had planned to meet anyone.

When she was found in San Diego, Leah told police she had not been harmed, CBS Los Angeles reported.

San Diego police are now handling the case. It is not clear if the 24-year-old found with Leah will face any charges.
