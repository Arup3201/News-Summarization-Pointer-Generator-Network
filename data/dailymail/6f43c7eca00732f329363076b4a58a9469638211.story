With its back straight and its head held high, he is the cockerel intent on walking tall.

Rather than scratching around in a farmyard and pecking at the ground like any normal rooster, this very special bird struts around bolt upright - walking more like a human.

Its strange stance and human-like walk has amazed residents in the Chinese city of Jinhua where the creature is kept in a zoo.

The rooster is likely to have suffered from osteochondrosis, which stops normal bone growth, at birth forcing it to walk upright more like a penguin.

Despite this, the cockerel seems to have no difficulty balancing as it shuffles along.

The owner of the unusual bird, Zong Jianping, said he bought it from a farmer in a village in Anhui Province.

Reports suggest he paid a massive 10,000 yuan (nearly £1,000) during a business trip last month.

But according to local news reports, Zong decided to send the three-year-old bird to a zoo - as he had no experience of keeping poultry.

Despite the huge outlay he said he was pleased that more people were able to see his bizarre pet.
