The Gibraltar Football Association has confirmed that the Estadio do Algarve in Faro, Portugal, will continue to serve as the venue for the nation's home Euro 2016 qualifiers.

With Gibraltar currently bottom of Group D after suffering heavy defeats to Poland, Republic of Ireland and Georgia, the GFA has revealed on its official Facebook page that financial and security concerns over continued usage of the stadium have now been resolved.

There had been rumours home matches could be played in London, but the GFA has now confirmed the team will continue using the Estadio do Algarve, with Germany (June 13), Ireland (September 4) and Scotland (October 11) all set to play them there in 2015.
