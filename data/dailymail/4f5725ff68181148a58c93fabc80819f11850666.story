The twin of a British jihadi bride arrested last week as she arrived back in the UK has told of her fury after missing out on a girls' holiday because of her sister's links to Syria. 

Jamila Henry, 21, was arrested at Luton airport after landing on a flight from Istanbul. She is thought to have fled the region after the breakdown of her second marriage.  

Her identical twin Jalila, who lives in Balham, south London, is a self-proclaimed party girl who has admittedly followed a very different path from her Muslim convert sister.

Jalila said while she and her sister were close as children they began following different paths as teenagers. Jamila (right) devoted herself to Islam while her party-loving twin (left) began clubbing late into the night

Speaking for the first time since her sibling's arrest, Jalila has told of her shock at learning the mother of one may have been living alongside the murderous terror group.

Jamila has since been charged with possession of an identity document with intent. At a hearing on Saturday morning at Westminster Magistrates Court she spoke only to confirm her name. 

The 21-year-old did not enter a plea. Her parents and sister were present for the brief hearing. 

In an interview published on the same day, Jamila's twin told The Sun's Rachel Dale how her plans for a girls' weekend to Amsterdam were scuppered by her sister's scheme.

She added she was disappointed with her sister's decision to return to Syria, but that the pair had followed different paths since they were teenagers. 

'She seemed completely normal. I don't know what to think, I can't believe she has treated me like this.'

Despite growing up in a shared bedroom in their Jehova's Witness mother's home in Streatham, south London, the twins grew apart as teenagers, she added. 

While Jalila became involved in London's nightclub scene, often staying out until the early hours of the morning, her more reserved sister devoted herself to the Koran. 

She had converted to Islam while at secondary school where 'it was the "in" thing to do,' her sister said.  

Jalila, who lives in Balham, south London, said she was disappointed her sister had returned to Syria 

Jalila (left) said her sister (right) described Syria as 'beautiful'. The young mother fled to the region after the breakdown of her first marriage to a Muslim Turkish Cypriot  

At 18, Jamila married and had a child in the UK. She and her husband became estranged and the increasingly devout youngster fled to Syria with their son.

There she is thought to have married an ISIS militant before returning to Britain in December.

Upon her arrival she was questioned by police over alleged links to the terror group but was never charged. 

She returned to the war-torn region alone earlier this year and was picked up by Turkish authorities as she tried to re-enter Syria. Counter terrorism police  picked her up at Luton Airport on Thursday.

Speaking of her sister's stints in Syria, Jalila said she thought fondly of the country despite its ongoing turmoil.

'She said it was beautiful... she showed me pictures of all the amazing food they made and the house they lived in. 

'God knows what was in her mind when she got up and left again. She promised she would never go back.'  

Last week the pair's mother said she was planning to meet with relatives to discuss her daughter's arrest. 

Sharmeena Begum was named as the first of four Bethnal Green Academy schoolgirls to have fled home to join ISIS 

Jamila was remanded in custody this morning following a brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court. 

Her case will be heard at the Old Bailey on April 7. 

She was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism but has not been charged.

She has not entered a plea with regard to one charge of possessing an identity document with intent. 

It comes after five teenage girls who took an interest in Syria were banned from travelling abroad amid fears more British youngsters are planning to join the terror organisation. 

The girls, two of whom are 15 and three 16, had their passports removed by a High Court judge yesterday after concerns over their alleged plans were raised by a local authority. 

The adults responsible for them were also stripped of their passports.  The previous day a 16-year-old boy from Brighton was also banned from travelling abroad following the deaths of his older brothers, both killed in Syria.  

Earlier three teenage boys were thrown out of the country after being picked up in Istanbul as they tried to cross the border.

Their British parents phoned police after the boys, aged 17 and 19, went missing. Their arrival back in the UK came as footage of three north London schoolgirls who had earlier left the country to join frontline militants emerged. 

In February Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria.

The girls were captured on CCTV in the UK and in Turkey where they are thought to have been ushered over the border by an ISIS 'fixer' who provided them with false documents. 

Sharmeena Begum, who went to the same school as the girls in Bethnal Green, travelled to the region before them. 

Messages and images on Jamila's mobile phone suggested she was planning to head to Islamic State territory. Pictured is an ISIS member in the Syrian city of Raqqa
