She claims she's the slimmest she has been since she was 14 and it seems that Holly Hagan is keen to showcase the fruits of her labour.

The Geordie Shore star proudly shows off the results of her diet and exercise regime - as well as her new clothing designs - in a fashionable photo-shoot.

The 22-year-old reality TV star models her own range for The Fashion Bible - a collection of jumpsuits, party dresses and checked trousers, which she says are designed for the 'every day normal girl' to wear.

The reality TV favourite is a huge fan of fashion and is often spotted rolling out of Northern clubs in glamorous get-ups. 

She does, however, believe her style has had a much-needed overhaul since shooting to fame.

She told MailOnline: 'I struggle looking at old pictures of myself, I used to think I looked great on a night out with my five pairs of eyelashes, skimpy PVC skirt and one leather glove, but in reality, I looked like a baby elephant!' 

Showcase: Holly, 22, says she's the slimmest she's been and is keen to show off the results of her healthy diet  

'Now I feel confident about my body, and I want other girls to feel the same about theirs. Its all about being healthy and positive about your body, and being able to wear clothes that YOU feel confident in. 

'I wanted to create a clothing collection that the every day normal girl can wear. 

'I've always been curvy and I've often found it difficult to find clothes to fit my curves. 

'I have worked closely with the team at The Fashion Bible to create a collection that is wearable and flattering for all shapes and sizes so there is something for everyone.' 

Day to night: Holly says she wanted to offer something for everyone in her new range so that includes more casual dresses and glamorous evening attire

Healthy approach: The young star believes in carrots before carbs. 'I've been doing it for so long now that when I eat s*** it makes me feel bad. I prefer to be healthy now,' she said of her new diet

The Geordie Shore star clearly isn't having trouble keeping the weight off since ditching fatty takeaways and boozy nights out in favour of lean meat and vegetables. 

The party-loving star opened up about her diet plan to MailOnline, saying: 'I have lost a lot of weight since I first appeared on Geordie Shore, I've been doing it the healthy and natural way just simply swapping bad foods for healthy alternatives. 

'I used to snack on crisps and chocolate, but now I stick to a piece of fruit or protein bar.

'Carrots before carbs. I've been doing it for so long now that when I eat s*** it makes me feel bad. I prefer to be healthy now,' she said.

'I am a lower weight now then I was when I was 14. I'm still not where I want to be, but I would like keep going.'

Confidence: The 22-year-old says she finally feels confident about her body wants other girls to feel the same about theirs

Holly and her best pal Charlotte Crosby are now the only two remaining originals girls following Vicky Pattison's decision to leave the show - and it seems Holly is keen to cash in.

As well as her fashion range, the brunette recently released her debut tome, Not Quite a Geordie, a tale of her rise to fame.  

Holly's collection is available in sizes 6-32 in selected styles, and priced from £8.99 - £44.99. 

Body confident: Holly has been showing off her new figure on Instagram and slipping into skimpy partywear from e-tailers such as wantherwardrobe.com
