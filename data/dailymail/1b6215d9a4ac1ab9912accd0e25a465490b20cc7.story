Sheriff's deputies who showed up at Elliot Rodger's doorstep last month to check on his mental health hadn't seen online videos in which he threatens suicide and violence even though those recordings were what prompted his parents to call authorities.

The officers also failed to check his 
apartment - something Rodger later revealed came as a huge relief 
because they might have found the cache of weapons he went on to use in 
the massacre.

Upon
 arriving at the apartment, the 22-year-old simply dismissed the 
situation as a misunderstanding and the officers left, noting that Rodger was 'polite and timid'.

By the time law enforcement did see the videos, it was too late - the well-mannered, if shy, young man that officers concluded after their visit posed no risk had gone on a deadly rampage.

Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover said the sheriff's office 'was not aware of 
any videos until after the shooting rampage occurred'.

Sheriff Bill Brown has 
defended the officers' actions, but the case highlights the challenges 
that police face in assessing the mental health of adults, particularly 
those with no history of violent breakdowns, institutionalisations or 
serious crimes.

'Obviously, 
looking back on this, it's a very tragic situation and we certainly wish
 that we could turn the clock back and maybe change some things,' Brown 
told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday.

'At the time deputies interacted with him, he was able to convince them that he was OK,' he said.

It's
 not clear why the deputies did not become aware of the videos.

Attorney
 Alan Shifman said the Rodger family had called police after being 
alarmed by YouTube videos 'regarding suicide and the killing of people' 
that their son had been posting.

Doris
 Fuller, executive director of the Virginia-based Treatment Advocacy 
Center, said California law has provisions that permit emergency 
psychiatric evaluations of individuals who pose a serious threat, but 
that was never triggered.

Rodger's family has disclosed their son was under the care of therapists.

'Once
 again, we are grieving over deaths and devastation caused by a young 
man who was sending up red flags for danger that failed to produce 
intervention in time to avert tragedy,' Fuller said in a statement.

'In this case, the red flags were so big the killer's parents had called police ... and yet the system failed,' she said.

Rodger,
 writing in a manifesto, said the police asked whether he had suicidal 
thoughts and he was able to convince them he was fine.

He
 said he was relieved his apartment wasn't searched because deputies 
would have uncovered the cache of weapons he used in the rampage in Isla
 Vista.

He said he opened the door to his apartment talking to a group of sheriff's 
deputies, terrified they'd take him to jail before he could carry out 
his murderous plans.

'I had the striking and 
devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning
 to do, and reported me for it,' Rodger wrote near the end of a 
137-page biographical manifesto.

'If that was the case, the police would 
have searched my room, found all of my guns and weapons, along with my 
writings about what I plan to do with them.'

He
 posted at least 22 YouTube videos.

He wrote in his manifesto that he 
uploaded most of his videos in the week leading up to April 26, when he 
originally planned to carry out his attacks. He postponed his plan after
 catching a cold.

'On the 
week leading up to date I set for the Day of Retribution, I uploaded 
several videos onto YouTube in order to express my views and feelings to
 the world, though I don't plan on uploading my ultimate video until 
minutes before the attack, because on that video I will talk about 
exactly why I'm doing this,' Rodger wrote.

In
 the final video posted Friday, he sits in a black BMW in sunset light 
and appears to be acting out scripted lines and planned laughs.

'I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you,' the son of a Hollywood director who worked on The Hunger Games says.

In
 his videos and writings, Rodger voices his contempt for everyone from 
his roommates to the human race, reserving special hate for two groups: 
the women he says kept him a virgin for all of his 22 years and the men 
they chose instead.

At least two other people who saw Rodger's videos before Friday compared him to a serial killer, through a message board on a bodybuilding website and the social network Reddit.

The rampage played out largely as he sketched it in public postings.

He
 said he would start by 'silently killing as many people as I can around
 Isla Vista by luring them into my apartment through some form of 
trickery.'

He said he would knock them out with a hammer, and slit their throats.

On
 Sunday, the sheriff's office identified the final victims as Cheng Yuan
 Hong, 20, and George Chen, 19 - both from San Jose - and Weihan Wang, 
20, of Fremont.

Hong 
and Chen were listed on the lease as Rodger's roommates.

Investigators 
were trying to determine whether Wang was a roommate or was visiting the
 apartment.

Around 9.30pm, the shooting rampage began and lasted about 10 minutes.

In
 the end, he shot and killed three others at random and injured 13 more 
either with gunshots or the BMW that he used as a battering ram against 
bicyclists and skateboarders.

Deputies found three semi-automatic handguns along with 400 unspent rounds in the car. All were purchased legally.

It
 was a series of social media posts referencing suicide and murder that 
triggered their concerns, according to family spokesman Alan Shifman.

Upon
 arriving at Rodger's apartment, authorities said he dismissed the 
situation as a misunderstanding and claimed he had no intention of 
hurting himself or anyone else.

'He was articulate. He was polite. He was timid,' Brown said.

His behavior also failed to 'meet the criteria for an involuntary hold.'

Rodger later wrote that he was terrified the deputies were only moments from discovering his plans.

'If they had demanded 
to search my room ... (t)hat would have ended everything,' he wrote. 'For a few 
horrible seconds I thought it was all over.'

From
 then on, he kept at least one gun and a few loaded magazines near him 
at all times so that if police did return he could shoot at them and get
 away.

'Thankfully, all suspicion of me was dropped after I took down 
the videos from Youtube, and the police never came back,' he wrote.

'It was all because of 
the videos. I must have expressed too much anger in them,' he added. 'I immediately 
took most of them off of Youtube, and planned to re-upload them a few 
days before the Day of Retribution.'
