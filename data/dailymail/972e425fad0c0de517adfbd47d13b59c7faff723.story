Experts were baffled today after video footage emerged of a glowing squid-like creature swimming in a harbour.

Stunned eyewitnesses filmed the strange, luminescent, tentacled object which was flashing a variety of colours floating close to the top of the water.

Videos of the strange marine mystery in Bristol docks have popped up on YouTube and Twitter with many claiming to have seen an 'alien'.

This bizarre sight greeted people walking along Bristol harbourside - described by some as an 'alien-like creature' floating underwater

Dozens of people were left flummoxed after spotting the creature and quickly grabbed cameras to snap it.

Some have even suggested that Bristol legend Banksy may have had something to do with the weird object.

Marine biologists admit they are baffled,
 but claim the footage could be a marine salp which had drifted off 
course by the weather.

Dr Steve Simpson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, said: 'This is either a very interesting animal or someone's very cool interpretation of a marine creature.'

One Twitter said: 'It's obviously Father Christmas's underwater sleigh.'

While another questioned whether it had escaped from Bristol Zoo.

Dr Steve Simpson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, said: 'It's very intriguing - I don't really know what to make of it.

'There is a possibility that it is a special type of jellyfish or a marine salp. It's very unusual and I haven't really seen anything like it before though.

'What makes it even more unusual is that fact that it showed up in the middle of a really busy area.

'There are various marine animals that have biological illuminating abilities and they are able to make themselves flash.

'It is entirely possible that it is a marine creature which has been brought into the harbour because of the storms or maybe it was trying to shelter from the stormy seas.

'We are currently experiencing spring tides too which may have dragged whatever this is in from the sea.

'This is either a very interesting animal or someone's very cool interpretation of a marine creature.

'It looks really cool - it's incredible. I don't know if it will make a return tonight but I'm sure if it does it will be met by an eager crowd.'

It has not yet been established exactly what the creature was and whether it was alive or not.

Some people have suggested that Bristol legend Banksy may have had something to do with the weird object.

Dozens of people were left flummoxed after spotting the creature and quickly grabbed cameras to snap it.

Alex Gordon-Lennox, 22, who was one of the many people to witness the strange creature, said: 'It was just floating down the harbour. I've never seen anything like it before.

'I only noticed it because it was flashing and was so bright. I was out with some friends that night so we watched it travel down the water a bit and then it just seemed to disappear.

'It looked a bit like a jellyfish or a squid or something. It was amazing.'
