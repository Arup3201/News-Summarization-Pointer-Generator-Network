Houston police searching for the parents of a newborn girl who was found wrapped in a Walmart bag on a city street last week released composite sketches of what Bay Chloe's mom and dad may look like.

The pastel renderings created by a well-known forensic sketch artist depict a man and a woman with facial features combining Chloe's traits, like her grey eyes and thick dark hair.

The Harris County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that the portraits are based solely on Chloe's photo and not on the description of any possible witnesses.

Mom and dad: An artist created these pastel portraits of what baby Chloe's mother, left, and father, right, might look like using age progression and combining the child's facial features 

Baby Chloe was found by a woman walking her dog near an apartment complex in Cypress last Tuesday. The child was wrapped in a Walmart bag and still had her umbilical cord attached.

Artist Lois Gibson, who has created thousands of composite sketches of crime victims and suspects over the years, was touched by Chloe's story of abandonment and decided to help investigators find her parents.

Sheriff's office spokeswoman Christina Garza said Gibson first did an age progression of what Chloe would look like as a young woman to deduce what her mother and father could look like.

‘It might just look half like one and half like the other,’ Gibson told the Houston Chronicle. 'I think I have a 50 per cent chance of the sketches looking more like one than the other.’

The artist conceded that such factors as weight gain, dyed hair and acne make the process less precise.

Gibson, who made it into the 2008 Guinness Book of World Records as the World's Most Successful Forensic Artist, has created age progressions in other cases involving children, but never as young as Chloe.

Gibson made a name for herself when in 2007, she created a portrait of Baby Grace based from a body of a child found in a storage container near Galveston. A woman in Ohio saw the image and recognized the victim as her granddaughter.

Officials in Houston hope that Chloe's parents will provide important medical and genetic information that would help her future adoptive parents raise her.

The newborn, named Chloe by hospital staff in Houston, Texas, is now a week old and even has her first tooth - which she showed off to photographers as she smiled for cameras on Monday.

She was found outside an apartment complex on Tuesday last week after a woman's dog picked up on a scent and led her to a bag, where she made the startling discovery.

Paramedics took the young girl, who still had about three inches of umbilical court attacked to her stomach, to Texas Children's Hospital, where she was listed as in good condition.

'She was very healthy… didn't have a fever,' Estella Olguin with the Child Protective Services told KHOU. 'Fortunately, she did not suffer from being exposed to the elements
that evening.'

Doctors believe the young girl was dumped just hours after she was born. They also think she was born slightly premature at 35 weeks gestation.

CPS is now looking for the girl's mother or father; Olguin said they do not have to claim the baby but that a discussion with them would be useful to identify Chloe's family's medical history.

'So the person who is adopting this baby can have some more genetic 
family medical background on the baby to be able to raise her with more 
knowledge or information about her,' Olguin said.

Chloe will be cared for in a foster home as CPS continues the search. A hearing will be held on her behalf on March 4, and a judge will decide her fate, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Her early tooth is a genetic trait and could be a clue to tracking down the family, doctors said.

Sgt Gordon Trott, of the Harris County Sheriff’s Office, said an unnamed woman walking her pet at around 7pm came across a Walmart bag left near the fence surrounding the Stonegate Villas Apartments in the 11000 block of Grant Road in the Cypress section of Houston, according to the Houston Chronicle.

According to Trott, the woman's dog 
picked up a scent and led her to the bag. At first, the pet owner 
thought that someone had dumped a dead animal, but when she opened the 
parcel, she was surprised to find a little girl inside.

According to officials, the child was
naked, but her body temperature was normal, suggesting that she had not
been outside for a long time.

Her umbilical cord had not been clamped, but someone made sure to clean her up after birth.

Officials with the Harris County 
Sheriff's Office Crimes Against Children Unit said they have few leads 
since there are no surveillance cameras in the area where the newborn 
was abandoned.

'If it had not of been for the 
resident that came out to walk her dogs, that child may have laid there 
all night, possibly would've died,' said Trott.

Law enforcement officials were taken aback by the mother's decision to dump the newborn on the street since Texas has a Safe Haven law which allows anyone to drop off a child at a hospital or fire station without facing any legal repercussions, Click2Houston reported.

Endangering or abandoning a child is a third degree felony in Texas and punishable by two to ten years in prison. If the mother is a juvenile, she could still face repercussions in the juvenile courts.

But if the biological parents come forward in this case, investigators from the Harris County Sheriff's Department will try to determine the circumstances leading to the abandonment and then discuss the case with the District Attorney's Office, a sheriff's department spokesperson said.
