Hillary Clinton remained hospitalized Tuesday for treatment of a blood clot in her head, as daughter Chelsea tweeted from her bedside that she was grateful to be starting the new year with her family.

Clinton is being treated with blood thinners to help dissolve the clot, which is located in a vein behind her right ear that helps carry blood away from the brain.

'Wishing all a healthy & happy 2013,' Chelsea Clinton tweeted Tuesday. 'Grateful to be starting the new year with my family.'

Former President Bill Clinton has been spotted driving to and from his 
wife's side at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Washington Heights for 
much of the past 48 hours, according to CBS New York.

In a statement yesterday, doctors assured it was not a life-threatening condition and assured she had suffered no brain damage or stroke.

'In all other aspects of her recovery, the Secretary is making excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery. She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family, and her staff,' Drs Lisa Bardack and Gigi El-Bayoumi said in a statement.

A clot occurs when a blockage builds 
up, either from partial thrombus (coagulated blood) or an outside 
compression. When the vein becomes blocked, the coagulated blood may 
extend to veins draining the area, which could lead to a lack of oxygen 
and tissue death.
