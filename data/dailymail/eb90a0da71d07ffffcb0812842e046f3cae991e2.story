Hailee Steinfeld looked chic and sophisticated this morning as she attended Peter Som's fashion show wearing an emerald lace dress.

Looking well beyond her 15 years the True Grit star joined a number of other celebrity guests on the front row, including Allison Williams, star of HBO hit series Girls, Olympic gold medal runner Sanya Richards Ross and socialite Olivia Palermo.

As she entered the space at the Milk Studios in New York's Meatpacking District a number of commentators applauded her wardrobe choice with the NY Daily News Tweeting: 'She's so grown-up'.

She accessorised the feminine frock with black heels, matching dark green nail polish and pink lipstick.

Allison Williams, who said she was there because Som was a friend, opted for a modern oxblood and leather creation and Olivia Palermo was seen in animal print shorts and matching heels.

Meanwhile athlete Sanya Richards Ross was fully decked out in one of Som’s lace numbers, she told Associated Press: 'I love fashion. It’s in my genes. If you saw my grandmother going to the grocery store, you’d think she was having lunch with the Obamas. We’re always dressed up.'

Muted floral prints, jeweled collars,
Sixties-inspired shapes and midriff-baring cutouts were key features of
Som's Spring / Summer 2013 collection.

The New York-based designer, who has dressed the likes of Michelle Obama, Scarlett Johansson, and Claire Danes is known 
to experiment with texture and print, and today he didn't disappoint with a range of playful designs.

Steinfeld, who has previously fronted
a fashion campaign for Miu Miu, has been spotted at a number of events
since fashion week launched in Manhattan on Wednesday.

On Wednesday she attended the Erin by Erin
Fetherston spring 2013 presentation at The Standard Hotel modelling a 
dazzling Erin by Erin Fetherston dress with a Jean pearl mica clutch 
from Edie Parker.

She was 
spotted earlier that night at the celebration of the fall installment of
the Shops at Target wearing a different outfit, topped with a pair of 
Louboutin wedges.

The Oscar-nominee will next be seen 
in Romeo and Juliet, in which she plays the title character alongside 
Douglas Booth in the leading man role.

She
is also set to star in Ender's Game, a sci-fi film with an impressive 
ensemble cast including Harrison Ford, Abigail Breslin and Ben Kingsley.

And her career simply continues to soar, as it was reported this summer she has been cast in thriller Dead Of Winter.

The film, to be made by music video 
director Anthony Mandler, follows a teenager hoping to bond with her new
stepmother during a trip to a remote cabin - but danger soon strikes 
with a fugitive posing as a park ranger.
