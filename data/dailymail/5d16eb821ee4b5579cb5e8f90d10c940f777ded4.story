Newcastle are preparing a new contract for midfielder Moussa Sissoko amid tentative interest from Arsenal.

The 25-year-old France international has been a pivotal figure in the renaissance of Alan Pardew’s side this season although he was sent off against West Ham on Saturday after frustration got the better of him in their defeat.

Arsenal want a defensive midfielder who can link defence with attack and provide energy to their side.

Everton’s James McCarthy is also a confirmed target of Arsene Wenger but both Everton and Newcastle have little wish to sell in January even if faced with substantial bids.

Sissoko still has four years left on his contract but Newcastle are happy to reward his form with improved terms. They are also keen to tie him down as Cheick Tiote continues to attract interest from clubs in Russia and a bid is expected for January.

Newcastle, meanwhile, are keen on Danny Ings of Burnley but expect him to see out his contract and are maintaining an interest in MK Dons midfield prospect Dele Alli who has been the subject of enquiries from Liverpool and Brentford also.
