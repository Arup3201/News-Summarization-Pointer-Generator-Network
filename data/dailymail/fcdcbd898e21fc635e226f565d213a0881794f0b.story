Black Friday sends bargain-minded shoppers into a frenzy each year, but it's not even among the four best days for holiday deals, according to a new study.

The experts at Savings.com analyzed more than 1.5 million deals offered by 25,000 retailers online and in store over the past five years, and found that the days with the most and deepest discounts vary according to what type of item you're shopping for.

The prime time to purchase toys for your favorite child this year is November 26, two days before Black Friday, which falls on November 28. The second and third best days are December 8 and December 19, respectively.

Best time to buy: Savings.com, a website that offers promotional discounts at retailers, analyzed more than 1.5 million deals over the past five years to determine the best days for holiday bargains

Fashion fanatics, meanwhile, should hold off on making clothing purchases until December 1, as Cyber Monday is the recommended day for apparel, followed by December 11 and December 18.

However, those in the market for tech gadgets have already missed their prime shopping opportunity. November 1 had the best sales for electronics, with November 26 as the second best day and Black Friday as the third.

But there's hope for procrastinators too. December 15 is the ideal day to snap up 'novelties', a category that includes popular gifts such as books, candy, wine and flowers. There are more bargains to be found in the days leading up to Christmas, with December 22 and 23 as the runners up.

Meghan Heffernan, a Savings.com spokesperson, told MailOnline that deals have started earlier and earlier due to competition, with holiday promotions now peaking six to seven days before Thanksgiving. 

'We believe we see items peak at different times based on proximity to Christmas and Black Friday and based on retailers leveraging the fact that lots of consumers are shopping for deals earlier in the season,' she said. 

Shop talk: Black Friday sales, such as this one at a Texas Walmart in 2013, may cause a frenzy, but new research has found that the annual event is not among the four days with the best holiday bargains

'For novelties and gifts, shoppers often get the best deals as they typically peak closer to Christmas. Many of these types of gifts are usually purchased for co-workers and often times holiday travel forces consumers to buy these items earlier.'

Although Black Friday, the day following Thanksgiving, is generally regarded as the biggest date on America's shopping calendar, recent years have seen stores begin their sales on Thursday night. 

Macy's and Kohl’s have previously led the way for promotions to start early - opening on Thanksgiving rather than Black Friday.

However, some leading stores have announced that they will not open on Thanksgiving amid anger that traditional time at home is being lost to shopping.

A Facebook page called Boycott Shopping on Thanksgiving and various other online petitions were formed to stop shopping on the holiday, and stores such as Costco and Nordstrom will now close so that staff can enjoy the day with family.
