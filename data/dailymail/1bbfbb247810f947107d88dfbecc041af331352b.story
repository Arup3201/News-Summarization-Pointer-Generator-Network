A fault to the public address system left Portman Road in silence on Tuesday night - but Ipswich’s promotion message was loud and clear.

They close 2014 just a point behind leaders Bournemouth at the top of the Championship after goals from Tommy Smith, Daryl Murphy and David McGoldrick saw off Charlton.

This result extended Town’s unbeaten sequence to 11 matches - of which eight have been victories - and made for a very happy new year for Mick McCarthy.

Though a glitch in the electrics meant no music could be played or announcements made, leading to a slightly surreal atmosphere inside the ground.

When the players emerged from the tunnel for the second-half, for instance, they were greeted by a ripple of polite applause more accustomed to a county cricket ground in the absence of any club compere, thumping club anthems or guitar licks.

But despite the relative silence, Ipswich once again showed their Premier League credentials, grafting and grinding their way past Charlton’s firm resistance.

Fitness was not an issue despite the punishing Christmas schedule. McCarthy’s men were tenacious, the first to every ball and predatory when their chances arose.

McCarthy saw no reason to alter the team that had handsomely beaten fellow promotion challengers Middlesbrough and Brentford in their last two meetings.

Even Tyrone Mings, linked with a January move to the Premier League, couldn’t force his way back in after recovering from his infected toe.

Charlton were forced into a change after Oguchi Onyewu went down in the warm-ups and Joseph Gomez replaced him in defence.

The visitors started the brighter and inside the first minute, Johann Berg Gudmundsson crossed deep from the right and Jordan Cousins, straining to get a clean connection, placed the ball into the side-netting.

On nine minutes, Ipswich came within a fraction of taking the lead. McGoldrick curled an immaculate 25-yard free-kick around the Charlton wall, only to see the ball cannon back off the inside of the post.

The frontman then showed textbook control to bring the ball down after Gomez’s clearance landed on his chest but the shot was dragged wide of the near post.

The hosts were marginally the better side and their reward came just after the half-hour. A corner from Jay Tabb was headed into the mixer by captain Luke Chambers and, after Daryl Murphy miscued his shot, it fell kindly for Smith to hook the ball in.

It was the defender’s fifth goal of the campaign and his second in two games after he rounded off that 4-2 win at Brentford on Boxing Day.

Charlton, who started the night nine points off the play-offs in mid-table, responded well and a pass by Cousins sent George Tucudean into the clear.

Sensing the advancing Bartosz Bialkowski, Tucudean slid to get a shot away and the sprawling goalkeeper blocked. The ball fell out to Gudmundsson but his lob wasn’t powerful enough and Christophe Berra cleared in front of his goal.

Ipswich came within millimetres of doubling their lead in first-half stoppage time when McGoldrick curled another free-kick onto the post, the ball bouncing out off the back of goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.

The first chance of the second-half fell to Charlton after the influential Gudmundsson pirouetted 25 yards from goal and fired a low shot that Bialkowski gathered.

It triggered the London side’s best spell of the game and Johnnie Jackson headed over from Tucudean’s right-side cross as the home crowd aired their frustrations. 

David McGoldrick completed the 3-0 scoreline late on for the hosts at Portman Road

They needn’t have worried as Ipswich doubled their lead just shy of the hour mark. Tabb’s cross found Paul Anderson at the back post and his drilled ball was flicked on by Chambers and McGoldrick’s diving header struck the crossbar.

With no Charlton defenders in sight, the ball bounced back for Murphy to nod home his 17th of the season.

The visitors didn’t surrender and Ipswich spent much of the closing stages pinned back. Berra had to be composed to clear off the line from Igor Vetokele’s sub-strength header.

In the final minute, McGoldrick scored the goal his stellar efforts deserved, running onto a through ball and finishing with aplomb.

And towards the end there was plenty of noise. ‘The Town are going up,’ came the refrain from behind the goal. You’d better believe them.
