A rare Nazi bling-ring once owned by Adolf Hitler has been sold at auction but for significantly less than was expected.

The 'Hitler Ring' is made of silver and was originally plated with gold, and features a ruby-encrusted swastika on its base.

It was auctioned in Maryland and had been expected to fetch at least $110,000 but only made just over half of its estimated price, coming in at $65,725.

The ring was made for Adolf Hitler by fanatical Nazi goldsmith Karl Berthold

Set on an elaborate base and inside a silver ball, the ring is made from solid silver and topped with a huge ruby.

Though an official certificate shows it was made for Hitler, we have no way of knowing if he wore it

'We are very happy with the result,' 
Andreas Kornfeld, vice president of international client relations for 
the auction house told the Baltimore Sun.

'It is very difficult to estimate objects and relics such as the ring, 
since there are, or have been, no comparisons on the market.'

The ring was purchased by an American collector whom Mr Kornfeld would not identify.

'We got many — hundreds of thousands — of page views on the item,' he said.

Mr Kornfeld said the auction house did not receive any complaints about the controversial background of the item.

On the ring is a huge swastika that is supported by other swastikas and 
swords. The piece is crowned by a large ruby and mounted in a silver 
globe which rests on an elaborate foot, also with a swastika.

The ring was sold by the Alexander Historical Auctions House in Maryland.

The jewellry was accompanied with documents testifying that it was made for the Fuhrer.

The ring was crafted by the master goldsmith Karl Berthold who was a 
fanatical Nazi and kicked Jewish craftsmen out of his business in 
Frankfurt shortly after the regime came to power in 1933 - long before 
laws forbidding them from working came into place.

He wrote to Hitler saying he had fired the 'Bolshevik-Jew servants' and 
was commissioned by a party functionary to make the ring for the Nazi 
leader.

The ring was found at Berchtesgaden, Hitler's mountain retreat in Bavaria, in 1945 by American troops.

One of the soldiers pocketed it as a souvenir before selling it on.

It had been owned by several collectors over the years, the last of whom
 died two years ago and whose grandson put it up for sale this time 
around is now selling it
The Alexander Historical Auctions House is famous for selling Nazi-themed militaria and artefacts.

Three years ago it sold the diaries of Auschwitz 'Angel of Death' Josef 
Mengele - the camp doctor who performed terrible medical experiments on 
inmates - that he kept while on the run in Brazil.

Another more common kind of Nazi ring is the so-called 'death's head ring' awarded by Heinrich Himmler, the chief engineer of the Holocaust, to officers he considered particularly loyal or courageous.

One such ring was auctioned at Northamptonshire-based JP Humbert Auctioneers in 2008.

It had been signed by Himmler (pictured right) himself and was dated to commemorate the Night of the Long Knives, when Hitler purged a section of his own paramilitary which he considered to be challenging his authority.

A second death ring was stolen from a museum in Berchtesgaden in 2005 and was thought to be worth between four and 40 thousand pounds.

The theft prompted a Europe-wide warning from police to collectors to protect their items after Hitler's own gold Nazi party badge was stolen just a few weeks earlier.
