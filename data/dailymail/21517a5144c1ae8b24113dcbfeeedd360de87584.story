A Chinese woman nursed a hairless and emaciated stray dog back to health after discovering him wandering the streets.

Lu found the malnourished pooch near her home in Nanning, Guangxi Province, China in 2012 - and said he was so thin that no-one would go near him.

The kind-hearted woman decided to adopt the stray, calling him Tai Zhang, and welcoming him into her life.

Before and after: Tai Zhang has gone from being dangerously underweight and bald to being healthy and having an enviable fluffy white coat

Recalling her first encounter with Tai Zhang, she said: 'It looked so sad and thin', adding that he appeared to be suffering from a 'skin disease'.

Pitying the animal, she immediately went home to fetch it some food.

From that day on, she would meet the dog in the same spot near her apartment every day and always bring it something to eat.

She said: 'No one in the community would approach it. Even other dogs would bark it away.

Sick: Lu, who adopted Tai Zhang, said he appeared to be suffering from a skin disease when they first met 

'It waited for me each day under my building, which touched me.'

Thanks to her kindness, the dog, a Samoyed breed, recovered and was able to put on weight.

He also saw his fluffy white coat grow back - and was pictured happily showing off his new look in Lu's apartment.
