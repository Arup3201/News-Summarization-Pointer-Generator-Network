The BBC has been accused of anti-Government bias after a documentary on police spending cuts failed to mention big reductions in recorded crime.

The BBC Two documentary Police Under Pressure painted a bleak picture of policing in Sheffield, with over-stretched officers struggling to cope with a rising tide of anti-social behaviour.

The producers of the programme, which was screened last week, posed the question: ‘With cuts biting ever deeper, is it time to accept that there are certain things the police just can’t afford to do?’

But senior Tories pointed out that the hour-long programme made no mention of the fact that crime has fallen since 2010, both nationally and in South Yorkshire, where recorded crime has dropped by 16 per cent.

The programme also failed to give any broader explanation of why police budgets have had to be cut as part of the Coalition’s drive to tackle the huge budget deficit left behind by Labour.

It was made by the production firm Rare Day, whose founder Peter Dale has close links to the Institute of Public Policy Research, which is playing a key role in generating ideas for Labour’s next manifesto.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It is very disappointing to see the BBC once again producing programmes that are distorted and lacking in any balance. 

'We all know the police have had to take their fair share of cuts following Labour’s great recession, but at the same time they have cut crime by 16 per cent and many front line police jobs have been protected by Chief Constables.

‘It looks like the bias may be down 
to the fact that the production company has very close links to Labour’s
 favourite think tank the IPPR.

'All the same, the BBC should know 
better and certainly it is out of keeping with one of its fundamental 
founding principles to be impartial.’

Fellow Tory Philip Davies, a member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said there was no place for such ‘one-sided’ documentaries on the BBC.

Mr Davies said: ‘I don’t particularly support cuts to the police budget myself, and I have voted against them. But the BBC has a fundamental duty to be impartial and balanced. It is unacceptable for it to be putting out one-sided, biased programmes.

‘I have no problem with them making a programme about police cuts, but they have to also explain why this Government is having to make these cuts to public spending and they should explain what has happened to crime.’

The documentary chronicled community tensions in east Sheffield following a big influx of Roma immigrants from Slovakia.

The presenter said the police were ‘under pressure like never before’, and said that in South Yorkshire ‘the entire neighbourhood policing budget is now under review’.

The entire programme is viewed through the prism of real term budget cuts totalling 11.5 per cent, which have resulted in a seven per cent reduction in officer numbers in South Yorkshire.

The presenter says parts of Sheffield have been ‘starved’ of police patrols, and warns that a senior commander ‘just doesn’t have the officers’ to cope with the scale of the challenge.

The documentary showed some police officers complaining about the impact of cutbacks. But officers were also recorded complaining that the main issue holding them back was a lack of legal powers to deal with behaviour by Roma behaviour that angered other members of the local community, but which fell short of the legal definition of anti-social behaviour.

The BBC last night defended the broadcast, which was watched by more than a million people.

A spokesman said the second part of the documentary, which was due to be screened last night, did mention the national crime fall.’

The spokesman added: ‘We are confident that these observational films following the work of South Yorkshire Police adhere to our editorial guidelines and we have received only two complaints from an audience of 1.2 million.

‘Peter Dale has an excellent reputation for producing high quality documentaries. He has had very limited contact with the IPPR and has had no involvement with their crime and justice policy work.’
