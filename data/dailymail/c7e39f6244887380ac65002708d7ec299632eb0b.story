Robots are being sent into drug tunnels used for smuggling narcotics into the US.

In Arizona, the Border Patrol has unveiled its latest weapon in the war on drugs in the form of the three wireless robots.

The camera-equipped machines allow agent navigate the tunnels remotely and investigate storm drainage systems that smugglers use to sneak drugs, guns and people across the border.

The agency is using the devices to keep agents out of harm's way as many tunnels can be poorly built and possibly collapse and lack proper ventilation.

Three 12-pound robots also let agents navigate an underground labyrinth in a fraction of the time it would take an agent to explore the tunnel.

And the devices can be used in tunnels and pipes where agents can't fit.

'If we find a tunnel, we like to send a robot into clear the tunnel and identify any threats, contraband, potential people with weapons, and let the agent know ahead of time if the tunnel is structurally sound,' said Border Patrol Agent Kevin Hecht, an agency tunnel expert.

The Border Patrol held a demonstration of the devices yesterday in the southern Arizona border city of Nogales, where dozens of crude tunnels have been discovered over the years.

The tunnels discovered in Nogales have generally begun in Mexico and have tied into the Arizona city's storm drainage system.

Nearly 170 tunnels have been found nationwide since 1990, most along the Arizona and California border with Mexico.

The tunnel robots have been in use by Border Patrol for several years.

But the agency recently paid $109,000 for the three new cameras with money from an asset forfeiture fund, which comes from the seizure of property in criminal cases, including drug cases involving cartel members, the Border Patrol said.

Two of the three robots will remain in southern Arizona, while the third is headed to southern California, where immigration authorities have used a tunnel robot for a number of years.

In November, police uncovered one of the most sophisticated drug tunnels they have ever seen.

The tunnel designed to smuggle drugs from Tijuana, Mexico to San Diego was equipped with lighting, ventilation and an electric rail system, U.S. authorities said.

Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327lb of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.

The tunnel, which zigzags the length of 
nearly six football fields, links warehouses in Tijuana and San Diego's 
Otay Mesa industrial area. The area is filled with nondescript 
warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.
