She wrote: 'At 7:03 PM on September 26th, we finally met Charlotte. We’re in love.' 

Chelsea, 34, whose husband is investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, announced the news online at midnight on Friday - four days before the expected due date.

She said: 'Marc and I are full of love, awe and gratitude as we celebrate the birth of our daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.'

And hours after the news became public, President Clinton made his own announcement, describing the new parents as 'glowing' and 'bursting with pride'.

He said: 'We are blessed, grateful, and so happy to be the grandparents of a beautiful girl, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, born on Friday evening, September 26, 2014.

'We are thrilled to be with our daughter and her husband as they welcome their daughter into the world.

'Chelsea is well and glowing. Marc is bursting with pride. Charlotte's life is off to a good start.'

Bill and his wife Hillary, who have gushed at length about their excitement at a number of public speaking events in the past few months, both reposted their daughter's announcement, made on her Twitter page.

Breaking the news: Chelsea said she is 'full of love, awe and gratitude' four days before her expected due date

Chelsea was last seen on Wednesday afternoon at the annual Clinton Global Initiative summit in New York's Sheraton Hotel, where she had been on her feet for three days straight.

Despite resigning from her position as a specialist reporter for NBC in April, the former First Daughter, who was educated at Stanford, Oxford and Columbia universities, continued to work full-time for the Clinton Foundation up until she gave birth.

News of the birth will come as welcome news to supporters hoping Hillary Clinton will run for president since the former First Lady said she would wait until she became a grandmother before launching a second nomination bid.

A spokesman for the new parents, Kamyl Bazbaz, confirmed Clinton had the child on Friday.

As a result of the birth, new grandfather Bill has bowed out of a scheduled appearance to lend a hand to a pair of embattled Democratic candidates in Colorado.

Clinton was to speak at a fundraiser Saturday for Sen. Mark Udall. Gov. John Hickenlooper was also scheduled to be at the event. 

Both Democrats are locked in tight re-election battles with their Republican challengers. He has been travelling around the country to help the party this year. 

On Tuesday, Chelsea appeared on CNN with her growing baby bump as she revealed they had decided not to find out the gender of their first child until the birth as they wanted it to be a surprise.

'There are so few mysteries in life…any answer is a happy one,' Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Tuesday. 

'So my husband and I decided that we would enjoy this mystery for the nine-plus months that we're granted, and we are eager to find out what God will have given us.'  

The name Charlotte dates back to the 1700s, and means 'freedom'.

It has long been a favourite among royals and political dynasties, and last year it was the 11th most popular girl names  in the United States.

Surprise! Chelsea and Marc elected not to find out the gender of their first child advance

The couple, who married in July 2010, announced that they were expecting their first child in April.

Chelsea and Marc never revealed the due date, sparking rife speculation in the last few weeks as her bump grew. 

On Sunday, Chelsea stepped out with her husband wearing a fitted white T-shirt that showed off her baby bump, accessorizing the look with a gold strand necklace.

The parents-to-be held hands as they strolled down the street on their way to a political event at New York's Gotham Bar and Grill. 

And the rumour-mill was sent spinning when Bill Clinton, who served as the 42nd US president between January 1993 and January 2001, revealed to CNN that the baby would come by next month.

During the television interview, the former U.S. President said: 'I hope by the first of October, I'll be a grandfather.'

Last week, Hillary Clinton also excited fans as she told a crowd at political steak fry in Indianola, Iowa: 'Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch. So don't be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage.

'I want to babysit any chance I get,' she added. 

When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.

'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders,' she added.

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.'  

Aspirations: For Bill and Hillary Clinton, their dream to become grandparents has come true 

Bill Clinton has achieved many of his political aspirations, while for Hillary, there are still more to come.

But for the couple, one of the dreams they have never kept a secret has finally come true - they are grandparents. 

In recent years they have often gushed over their desire to have grandchildren while their daughter Chelsea has mentioned her need to reassure her mother she would one day have a child. 

The former president was the first to speak of his ambitions for an extended family. During a conference in Vienna in July 2010, where he spoke about his bucket list, he said: 'What I'd really like to do, if I could have my wishes, I would like to live to see my own grandchildren.' 

Two months letter during an appearance on the David Letterman Show after Chelsea's marriage to Marc, he added: 'Hillary wanted this marriage because she wants to be a grandmother more than she wanted to be president.' 

Speaking in the March 2011 issue of Harper's Bazaar, the ex-Secretary of State admitted that she'd probably be an 'unbearable' grandmother, but she'd 'love' her daughter to have children.

She said of the suggestion: 'Well, no pressure, because I don't want to be one of those kinds of mothers. But obviously, someday, I'd love it.'

However, in an interview in Davos the same year her husband suggested there may have been more pressure than first thought.

'I'd like to be a grandfather ... I would like to have a happy wife, and she won't be unless she's a grandmother,' he said.

In September 2013, during an appearance on 'CBS This Morning', Bill was asked whether his wife would prefer to be a grandmother or elected to the White House.

'If you ask her, I think she'd say grandmother, but I have found it best not to discuss that issue. My goal is to be a grandfather. The rest is out of my hands.' 

During an appearance on the Racheal Ray show in 2003, Chelsea spoke about her diplomatic parents' 'unapologetic desire' for a grandchild.

'They would tell you without blinking an eye that it would make them the happiest thing on earth if I were to make them grandparents,' she said.

She added that she and Marc had decided to make 2014 the 'Year of the Baby' and urged the presenter: 'Please, call my mother and tell her that. She asks us about it every single day.' 

Bill even became a vegan because he 'wanted to see his grandkids grow up'

He adopted a 'plant-based' diet about five or six years ago, according to Dr Dean Ornish, a physician consultant to Bill Clinton and an adviser to Hillary Clinton for more than 20 years.

'I asked him why... and he said, 'I want to live long enough to walk my daughter down the aisle and to see my grandkids born and grow up,'' the consulting physician told the Huffington Post.

When Chelsea announced the pregnancy earlier his year, the couple took to Twitter to share their excitement.  

Hillary wrote: 'My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be! @billclinton and I are thrilled that Chelsea and Marc are expecting their first child!'

Husband Bill echoed her words, saying: 'Excited to add a new line to my Twitter bio...grandfather-to-be! @hillaryclinton and I are so happy for Chelsea and Marc!'
