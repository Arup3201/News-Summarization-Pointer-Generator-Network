Possible presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's health issues have been kept secret for fears they will ruin her eligibility to become president, it has been claimed.

The remarkable claim comes in a new book written by journalist Ed Klein which details the rocky relationship between the Obama and the Clinton families.

The excerpt on her health includes a claim from a cardiac specialist familiar with Clinton's condition as saying her clotting in the brain could have developed into a stroke.

In further excerpts of the book reported by Drudge Report, the author claims Hillary Clinton's health problems, which have included the blood clot between her skull and brain, were revealed in a trip to hospital after she fainted.

He wrote she had a track record of fainting and a tendency to form blood clots.

'She also suffered from a thyroid condition, which was common among women of her age, and her fainting spells indicated there was an underlying heart problem as well.

'A cardiac stress test indicated that her heart rhythm and heart valves were not normal.

The author added: 'She had managed to keep her medical history secret out of fear that, should it become public, it would disqualify her from becoming president.'

It made headlines worldwide when Clinton fainted and was concussed in an accident it was claimed occurred at her home in 2012.

Her health has also become a talking point in recent weeks as speculation continues over whether she will run for the 2016 presidency.

In defending his wife last month, former President Bill Clinton said it took his wife 'six months of very serious work' to get over her concussion induced health issues but she is fine now.

However, Clinton's statement inadvertently raised more questions about her health than it did to put a lid on the story.

GOP strategist Karl Rove recently called
 for Clinton to publicly release her medical records, although he shied 
away from questioning her health.

Meanwhile, Klein's book 'Blood Feud' has meticulously detailed the animosity between the Obamas and the Clintons - the two power couples of the Democrat Party.

Dating back to then Senator Obama's defeat of Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic nomination they believed was theirs, Bill has never forgiven Obama for allegations he made during that bitter campaign.

'I hate that man Obama more than any man I've ever met, more than any man who ever lived,' said Bill Clinton to a friend after Obama suggested he was a racist in 2008 according to Klein's book, excerpts of which appear in The New York Post.

According to an account of Klein's explosive allegations in The New York Post, Michelle Obama would sit in the evenings with her trusted adviser, Valerie Jarrett to gossip about Hillary over a bottle of Chardonnay.

They nicknamed Hillary the 'Hildebeest', in reference to the ugly and sturdy gnu that is often seen wandering the Serengeti.

In the run up to the 2012 election, President Obama's campaign team advised the sitting president that he needed to utilize the sure-touch of Bill Clinton if he wanted to secure a second term.

Loathe to do this, President Obama 
finally asked the former president to play a round of golf with him in 
September 2011, to ask for his help.

'I’m not going to enjoy this,' Bill told Hillary according to Klein.

'I’ve had two successors since I left the White House — Bush and Obama — and I’ve heard more from Bush, asking for my advice, than I’ve heard from Obama. I have no relationship with the president — none whatsoever,' Clinton said.

'Sometimes we just stare at each other. It’s pretty damn awkward. Now we both have favors to ask each other, and it’s going to be very unpleasant. But I’ve got to get this guy to owe me and to be on our side.'

The golf game was petty, tetchy and not without incident.

President Clinton
 immediately tried to claim the upper hand by reminding Obama that he 
presided over an economic golden age, while Obama was struggling to 
affect any change during the Great Recession.

Hammering
 home his point, Bill Clinton told President Obama that obviously he and Hillary 
would be running for president in 2016 and that his wife would be 'the 
most qualified, most experienced candidate, perhaps in history.'

This rankled with President Obama, acutely aware of any attacks on his relative inexperience on walking into the White House.

'And
 so Bill continued to talk about Hillary’s qualifications . . . and the 
coming campaign in 2016,' writes Klein as featured in The New York Post.

Deal: According to Edward Klein, Bill Clinton agreed to fully campaign for Barack Obama on the proviso he supported his wife in 2016

'But
 Barack didn’t bite. He changed the subject several times. Then 
suddenly, Barack said something that took Bill by complete surprise. He 
said, ‘You know, Michelle would make a great presidential candidate, 
too.’

'Bill was speechless. Was Barack comparing Michelle’s qualifications to Hillary’s?

'Bill
 said that if he hadn’t been on a mission to strike a deal with Barack, 
he might have stormed off the golf course then and there.'

A deal was struck nonetheless and Bill delivered a barnstorming speech to the Democratic National Convention, which threatened to upstage the president himself.
