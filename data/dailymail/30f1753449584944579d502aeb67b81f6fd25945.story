Lucy Crawford snuck in and out of privileged New York households for years helping pampered teens with their college applications

A top New York tutor has revealed some of the dirtiest tricks played by parents when trying to score their child a place at Ivy League universities.

Lucy Crawford worked as an independent college-applications counselor for 15 years all over the United States, and has revealed desperate measures taken by parents in over competitive New York city were the most shocking of them all.

Speaking to the New York Post, Ms Crawford let slip how the majority of these privileged parents set their children up to fail from the beginning of their education and then bully them into complete disbelief when it comes to the dreaded college application essay.

Ms Crawford said: 'Here the frenzy is amplified by money and power as it only can be in New York. Here, too, the opportunities for obsessive parents to break a student's heart seem sharper than anywhere else.'

The former tutor and author revealed how her students had such low self-belief they would sob in front of blank pages when trying to compose their applications, describing the process as 'hopeless' after their parents had done little to encourage their personal abilities.

Ms Crawford revealed how children are placed on the Ivy league fast track from as young as two when their parents employ consultants to deliver nursery school acceptances.

If the child shows any kind of academic weakness as they grow older, a tutor is immediately instated and if this fails the parents will try to identify a deficit in the child's capabilities and pass this off as a handicap to get them out of situations where they may fail, according to Ms Crawford.

Universities are chosen two years in advance, and are ordered in preference according to which top school the child's parents attended (this is referred to as a "legacy school") and then by where the family has most influence.

Universities like Harvard (pictured) and Yale are at the top of the list for pushy parents who will make up almost anything to secure their child a place

After schools are selected according to this code, the teenager is required to compose the dreaded application essay - which is where Ms Crawford comes in.

Because most of the teens have never had to do things for themselves in the past, the majority struggle with this ubiquitous task.

Ms Crawford says: 'Faced with that blank page, the students panic. They freeze. Their entire lives have been pointed towards this one test of their worth. Who wouldn't suffer writer's block? The parents yell. Everyone sobs.'

According to Lucy Crawford, the pampered teens of New York become overwhelmed when writing application essays because their parents don't believe in them. Posed by model

'From 2000 to 2010, more than 90 percent of my students were accepted at their top-choice schools. My name was shared among wealthy families who would not have dreamed of hiring one of the big college-application consulting shops; they wanted exclusivity, someone other students couldn’t have.'

Ms Crawford claims she was often requested to fill out false invoices so the wealthy family involved weren't caught out using her services.

But the dishonesty didn't stop there as she recalls one frustrated mother who, distraught her French son's English wasn't good enough for Ivy League education, forced him to state he was black on his application to better his chances.

'“My ex-husband, he’s not seeing the application, so we’ll say what we want. We lived four years in Senegal. Our name is exotic. So, we will check the box and say he is black "Why not?” she pressed me. “Can they ask for proof?”', Ms Crawford recalls.

The rouse however did not work, and the mortified boy in question was not admitted like so many others whose parents are left astounded and demanding answers when their money and power falls short.

Ms Crawford's experience has inspired her first novel, Early Decision, which is out this week.
