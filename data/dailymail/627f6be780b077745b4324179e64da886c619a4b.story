A £300million tycoon who has failed to pay a £450,000 fine was slammed by Britain's most senior judge, who said 'it seems there is one law for the rich and another for the poor'.

Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the Lord Chief justice, said multi-millionaire Philip Edward Day should pay the fine imposed on him for damage caused to ancient Cumbrian woodland.

The judge made the comments after he discovered Day had not paid the fine within a court-ordered 112-day limit.

Day is battling to clear his name and is challenging he £450,000 fine imposed on him in August for allowing workmen to decimate a beauty spot so a track could be built to his pheasant shoot.

Natural England took Day to court after a huge swathe was cut through picturesque Gelt Woods, flattening trees, churning up soil and disturbing wildlife on his land near Brampton, Cumbria.

Before the illegal felling, the area was sheltered by birch and oak trees. Mosses and liverworts grew on sandstone outcrops and birds such as pied flycatchers, redstarts and wood warblers thrived.

But by the time Mr Day's workmen had finished, the landscape – which provided stones for Hadrian's Wall – was a scarred scene of destruction. 

Lord Thomas told the Court of Appeal: 'We send people to prison, we do not wait for the outcome of any appeal - why should this be any different?

'It seems to me there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. It is really of concern that a fine of this magnitude has not been paid, in light of the destruction of part of the common heritage of mankind.

'There is no reason why the exchequer should not have had these funds - if the appeal is successful, they would pay it back.'

Philip Day admitted causing the 'devastating' damage near Edmond Castle, his Tudor-style mansion in Cumbria

Mr Day, who lives in Edmond Castle, a 19th Century Tudor-style mansion, said he did not know the work was being carried out and had not authorised it.

However, after Judge Peter Hughes QC ruled the offence was one of 'strict liability' - and did not depend on Mr Day's state of knowledge - the businessman admitted two counts of allowing unauthorised work to be carried out.

Mr Day was given 112 days to pay the fine, with a jail term of four years to be served in default, but his lawyers told Lord Thomas the payment had been 'put on hold' pending the outcome of his appeal.

Richard Matthews QC, for the tycoon, argued the fact the works had taken place on his land was not enough to attach any blame to Mr Day for what happened. 

He added the fine imposed on Day, said to be as rich as the Queen, was 'excessive', and that too much weight had been placed on the accused's wealth, with a £40,000 fine more reasonable.

Judge Hughes did not take enough account of the £30,000 spent on restoration works at the site, Mr Matthews also argued.

He said: 'There was the opprobrium of the criminal conviction, this is the loss of character.

'It is real, and would have been without the publicity and the judge's sentencing remarks.'

But Rex Tedd QC, for the Crown, urged the court to uphold the conviction and said the level of the fine was not excessive given the size of Mr Day's fortune and the damage to the site - which the judge had visited.

He said: 'The judge was in an unrivalled position to consider the extent of the damage to the site. We say the starting point is that there is no reason to disturb the judge's findings as to the harm actually done.

'There was a witness who described himself as being deeply shocked at what he saw and we say that the word 'devastation' was not an inappropriate expression in the circumstances.'

The Court of Appeal has reserved its decision on Day's appeal and will give its ruling at a later date.
