Jonathan Trott will make his return to cricket in Warwickshire's two-day friendly with Gloucestershire at Edgbaston on April 1.

Trott, 32, left England’s Ashes tour after the first Test in Brisbane with what was described as a stress-related condition following a traumatic ordeal at the hands of Mitchell Johnson.

But the No 3 is ready to make a comeback and will be targeting a return to the Test team.

Trott tweeted: 'Thrilled to confirm I will return for @CricketingBears vs Gloucs on 1st April. Thanks to everyone for such amazing support #youbears'.

And in a statement released by Warwickshire he added: 'I’ve been overwhelmed with the kind messages of support from players, coaches and fans over the last few months, and I’m really looking forward to joining up with Warwickshire ahead of the new season.

'We’ve got a strong squad that’s capable of challenging for trophies in all competitions, and I’m determined to play a big role and hopefully contribute to more success for the Bears in 2014 and beyond.'

The county's coach Dougie Brown said: 'Everyone at Edgbaston will be thrilled to see Jonathan return to training after the Club’s pre-season tour of Barbados, and take to the field at Edgbaston in the 2014 season.

'Having met recently, he looks in great shape and is certainly hungry to score plenty of runs for Warwickshire. He’s been a crucial member of the England set up for nearly five years and I am certain he will be back as England's No 3 in the near future.'

Disappointing: Alastair Cook's side were embarrassed in Australia, but Trott is focused on a return

When it was 
revealed that Trott had long-standing mental health issues during the tour Down Under, it seemed 
his career at the highest level was over.

But Warwickshire chief executive Dennis Amiss, who will serve 
as Trott’s benefit chairman this summer, said: ‘He’s still very 
hungry. He wants to continue succeeding for Warwickshire and England.’

If
 his comeback game goes to plan, Trott, who has been given permission to miss
 his county’s pre-season tour of Barbados, will play against Oxford 
University on April 7 and then the Championship opener at Edgbaston 
against Sussex the following week.

‘He’s
 doing very well,’ said former England batsman Amiss. ‘He’s had a great 
rest, which was very important, and he is raring to go again.

‘Cricket
 is his passion and I believe he has the qualities to come back, score a
 mass of runs for Warwickshire and get himself back in the England 
side.’

Out of practice? Trott has hardly featured for Warwickshire since earning his England contract

While it is 
undoubtedly good news that Trott is on the mend, England will have to be
 certain that the problem will not recur if he again faces the stresses 
of top level cricket.

They 
were aware of Trott’s earlier problems - and left him out of a one-day 
international against Australia at the Ageas Bowl last summer because of
 his condition - and handled his departure Down Under with great 
sensitivity.

Yet if he makes
 an immediate return to the international fold it may look as though it 
is permissible to quit a difficult, high-profile tour and return as soon
 as the going gets better, in this case when England face Scotland and 
then Sri Lanka early this summer before their Test series against India.

Amiss,
 who is undoubtedly speaking for Trott now, has no doubts. ‘I think the 
problem was essentially burn-out,’ he said. ‘The ECB have helped him 
since he has been back home. Everyone has given him a lot of help. Rest 
is the most important thing.’

Familiar pose: Trott will hope to get back to acknowledging centuries for England

Trott
 is understood to have held talks with Paul Downton, the busy new 
England managing director, to try to convince him that he will be fit 
for England this summer.

And
 a team who are starting from scratch after the worst Ashes tour in 
history will not lightly turn their back on a batsman with a Test 
average of almost 47 and a one-day average of 51.

Yet
 they will have to be absolutely sure that Trott is fully fit before 
they welcome him back, a process he can begin by scoring runs for 
Warwickshire in April.
