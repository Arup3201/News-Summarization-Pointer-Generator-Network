More than 100 Conservative backbenchers have written to David Cameron demanding legislation guaranteeing a referendum on Britain’s future in Europe after 2015.

The Prime Minister, who pledged earlier this year that he would offer voters an in/out referendum if he wins the next election, is under increasing pressure from MPs to put forward an ‘enabling’ Bill in this Parliament.

Several ministers and junior members of the Government are thought to be backing the idea, although only backbench MPs signed this week’s letter.

David Cameron's landmark promise of a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU depends on the being able to claw back powers from Brussels

Downing Street insists it would be 
impossible to introduce a Government Bill, as the Liberal Democrats will
not back a referendum.

But eurosceptic Tories say a Commons 
vote on the issue before the general election in 2015 is vital to prove 
the party means to honour its pledge – and embarrass Ed Miliband and 
Nick Clegg, who oppose the idea.

John Baron, the MP who organised the 
letter, said: ‘We are going to be looking for all opportunities to raise
this on the floor of the House. Over 100 Conservative colleagues and I 
have urged him to bring the enabling legislation forward in this 
Parliament.

French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have rejected Mr Cameron's review of Brussels' powers as a British 'political exercise'

David Cameron last year set out a detailed timetable for staging a historic referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.

‘This would address the lack of 
public trust. When people hear politicians making promises about an EU 
referendum, they don’t know whether to believe them.

'The legislation offers the chance to convince the electorate. The referendum promise has to be credible and believable.’

Mr Cameron sent shockwaves through 
Europe when he gave a guarantee of an in/out vote on our membership if 
he is Prime Minister after 2015.

He vowed to campaign for Britain to 
stay in – as long as Brussels agreed to renegotiate a looser, more 
trade-based relationship and return key powers to Westminster.

And he has insisted that a referendum
held by the end of 2017 would be a deal-breaker in any future coalition
deal with the Liberal Democrats.

A Downing Street source said: ‘There 
aren’t any plans for legislation this side of the election, as opposed 
to afterwards, since it’s quite difficult to introduce a Bill if one 
part of the Government doesn’t support it.

‘We have said that it is a red line 
for David Cameron. If he is Prime Minister after the next election, 
there will be a referendum in the next Parliament.’
