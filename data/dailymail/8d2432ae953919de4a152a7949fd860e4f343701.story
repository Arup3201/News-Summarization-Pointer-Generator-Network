A family of eight are fighting to save their property - after discovering that a planned high speed rail network could leave them homeless.

Widow Vikie Shanks, 54, and her seven children are set to lose out if their seven bedroom home is compulsorily purchased to make way for the HS2 line - just 130-metres away.

All the money from the buy up would go straight to the family’s mortgage lender - leaving them with no money to spend on another home.

They have now filed a lawsuit in the hope they can challenge the amount they will be offered by the new high speed London to Birmingham rail network.

Vikie said: 'I have been hit hard by the depression and with a family with seven children it is hard to keep up with payments.

'When my husband died I sat the children down and they were adamant they wanted to stay here. The happy memories with their dad are here.

'I promised them I wouldn’t leave and that the house would always be in the family.

'Bearing in mind I have four autistic children I can’t even move the dining room table without them having a melt down.

'I can’t and I don’t want to think about moving them out of this home - let alone having nowhere else to go.'

Home: The family have a strong emotional connection to the house in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, and are distraught that they might lose it

The large family have lived in the house, in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, for 25 years.

They formed a deep emotional attachment to the home after the death of husband and father, Paul, in 2007, which left the family clinging to the last remaining memories of him.

But they discovered the planned HS2 network high speed rail link between London and Birmingham will pass through their 13 acres of land - just 130-metres from their home.

Some homes on the train line route face being the subject of a Compulsory Purchase Order by the network - which pays an aggravated valuation of each house.

Before his death Paul took out a £600,000 mortgage on his house - but the family now say the house could be worth just £400,000.

Vikie said: 'The compensation scheme gives you the market valuation of the house, which then goes straight to your mortgage lender so you don’t get to see it at all.

'At the moment my house is valued at £200,000 lower than my mortgage - which leaves me with £200,000 left to pay.

'I would end up bankrupt without a home and with no ability to buy one - how can that possibly be legal?'

Vikie, who runs a corporate entertainments business, currently only pays the interest on the mortgage because she cannot afford to pay anymore.

Autistic Nikita, 14, Osborn, 13, and Pippa, 11, each attend special schools and due to the severity of their condition cannot be moved through fear of making their situation worse.

Difficult: According to their mother Vikie four of the Shanks children have autism and would find any move very traumatic

Circled: The Shanks' home could be demolished to make way for the HS2 rail link from London to Birmingham

Their worried mother fears that by losing the house she may have to look else where for somewhere to live, uprooting her children and losing the stability they have.

She said: 'It will devastate my children. I can’t imagine how it will affect them.

'I just couldn’t change their schools - it would be the worst thing I could contemplate doing, I just couldn’t think about it.

'I’m very anxious, we’re all very anxious. My life is tough as it is but now I have to deal with this as well.

'I don’t mind still having the debts and the negative equity but I need some where which is equivalent.

'How can it possibly be right when I’m going to end up in a situation where I will be homeless?

'The government should re-house them in the same type of property with similar debts.'The lawsuit, against Secretary of State for Transport, Justine Greening, was filed by her 21-year-old daughter, Jamie Shanks, who is receiving legal aid for the case, on May 22.

She said: 'This is our home and it represents 25 years of blood, sweat and tears by my parents.

'We can’t take our memories that the house represents with us. This is our sanctuary.'

A spokeswoman for HS2 said: 'We have advised the Shanks’ family that their building has not been identified for demolition or as being at risk of demolition in our assessments to date.

'According to the land ownership information we have obtained from Land Registry, the line does appear to pass through some of the land associated with the Shanks’ property.

'Until further design and planning work has been completed we are not in a position to confirm the extent of the land that would need to be acquired.

'We have advised the family that if it did become necessary to buy land which they own, they would be fully compensated for it.'
