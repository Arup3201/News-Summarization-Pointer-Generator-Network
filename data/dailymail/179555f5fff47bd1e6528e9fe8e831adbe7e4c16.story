Novak Djokovic eased into the third round of the French Open with a comprehensive 6-1 6-4 6-2 victory over Jeremy Chardy at Roland Garros.

The clay court showpiece is the only grand slam to have eluded Djokovic so far in his career but he looked in ferocious form on Wednesday as he blew away Chardy in just an hour and 31 minutes.

Chardy held serve in his opening game but when he dropped the fourth, the world number two never looked back.

Dominant: Novak Djokovic beat Jeremy Chardy in straight sets to progress in the French Open

No contest: Djokovic won 6-1 6-4 6-2 to reach the third round of the French Open

More to come: However, it is the one Grand Slam to elude the Serb and he will have his work cut out to win it

Djokovic was demonstrating all of his trademark athleticism to make it hard for his opponent but Chardy was not helping himself with unforced errors and the Serbian closed out the set in just 25 minutes.

Djokovic broke Chardy in the first game of the second but the Frenchman broke right back before dropping his serve again with a double fault to hand the initiative back to his opponent.

The rest of the set went with serve and Djokovic never looked overly troubled as he appeared to be going through the motions.

Djokovic made it five from five on break point in the opening game of the third and looked set to steamroller his way to victory but he handed Chardy a second serve as he attempted to break back and the world number 42 took advantage with a crushing forehand.

The run of breaks continued as Djokovic took the next and he was well in control despite letting out an almighty cry of frustration when sending a backhand into the net.

Djokovic dropped his first two break points of the match in the next but made no mistake with the third, a backhand pass securing a 4-1 lead and ending Chardy's resistance.

The remaining games went with serve as the rain began to fall on Court Philippe Chatrier and Djokovic eased into the next round.

Photographic memory: Djokovic's coach Boris Becker was paying close attention to the match

Team: Becker later celebrated with Marian Vajda (2nd L), physical trainer Gebhard Phil-Gritsch (2nd R) and physiotherapist Milan Amanovic

So close: Djokovic's best performance at Roland Garros came in 2012 when he was a losing finalist
