The fourth round of the FA Cup could be one to remember with Manchester United's encounter against Cambridge United the pick of the fixtures. 

FA Cup holders Arsenal will have to eliminate Brighton if they are to hold on to the FA Cup, while Chelsea could host fellow Londoners Millwall if Ian Holloway's side can defeat Bradford in a replay. 

There could be two all-Premier League ties as Southampton will host Crystal Palace if they can beat Ipswich at Portman Road and Burnley or Tottenham will entertain Leicester.
