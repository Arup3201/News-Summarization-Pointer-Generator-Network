Hundreds of homeowners will share £1million compensation from Manchester Airport after noise and fumes from a second runway slashed the value of their homes.

Nearly 600 homeowners will receive £1,500 each - 11 years after the runway first opened in 2001.

The payout marks the end of the long-running legal battle which has seen the airport pay out more than £9million compensation.

Payout: Manchester Airport will hand over £1million compensation split between 583 homeowners at the end of an 11-year legal battle

The 583 households in Knutsford and Mobberley who lodged claims will receive the new payout.

The airport will also pay the council tax precept, which is levied to fund Knutsford town council and Mobberley parish council, for one year.

This will be worth £117,702 in total - and will benefit every household in the area. Six local state schools will also receive a £1,300 one-off payment after the deal was struck.

Chancellor George Osborne, whose Tatton constituency covers the area, said the compensation payout was a 'good outcome' for property owners.

Airport chiefs had said they would not hand out any more cash because a legal time-limit for claims had passed.

Campaigners from the Manchester Airport Environment Network, led by Knutsford resident Jeff Gazzard, and Mr Osborne held talks with airport bosses to try and secure a fresh pay out to those who had not submitted claims before the 2010 deadline.

Mr Osborne said: 'Years of hard campaigning have finally paid off. I want to thank local people for their support and Jeff Gazzard for all his work - he has been a star. At last we have a fair deal for local communities.'

Mr Gazzard welcomed the compensation settlement - and said it would end a decade of campaigning.

'It’s an acceptable deal,' he added. 'We were totally reliant on the airport’s good will because legal timeframes for compensation had passed so this was a fair solution.

'I don’t think it is tokenistic but some people may be a little disappointed at the amount - they probably wanted a little more. We’ve taken extreme care to get this right and this now draws a line under the second runway issue.'

A spokesman for Manchester Airport said: 'The legal process for Runway 2 claims formally concluded in 2010. However, since then, George Osborne MP and Jeff Gazzard have presented us with a convincing case which showed inequity in the legal process.

'We have now agreed with them a final package of benefits as a goodwill payment.

'We hope that this demonstrates our commitment to work with our local communities as a responsible business and finally draws a line under this process.'
