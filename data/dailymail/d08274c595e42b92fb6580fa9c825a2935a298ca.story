Loving couple: Elizabeth Smart and Matthew Gilmour, in a Scottish kilt, were pictured walking hand-in-hand out of the temple after their wedding in Hawaii

New details are emerging about how Elizabeth Smart and her new husband Matthew Gilmour incorporated their respective family traditions into their tradition-filled Hawaiian ceremony on Saturday.

The 24-year-old bride, who made headlines when she was found nine months after being kidnapped at knife-point when she was a young teen, looked stunning in a lace boat-necked dress with a full, drop-waist skirt.

Mr Gilmour, 22, showed off his Scottish heritage with pride as he wore his dead father’s kilt and a boutonnière with blue thistle that had been flown in for the occasion.

To outside observers, a quickly-planned Hawaiian wedding may not seem fitting for the ever-traditional couple, but the location has a real resonance with the bride: it is the place where she and her family visited in 2003 shortly after she reunited with her family after her harrowing kidnapping.

‘I guess you could say it was kind of a refuge,’ Ms Smart told People magazine.

‘Oahu is a very special place for me, very different than what I was used to.’

The couple, who met while on their 
missionary year in France, married at an 11.30am ceremony in the LDS 
Laie Hawaii Temple which was only attended by very close family and 
friends.

In accordance with the religion’s 
teachings, the actual ceremony itself can only be attended by fellow 
Mormons who have been given a ‘temple recommend’ sign-off, which 
essentially says that they are viewed in good standing with the church.

Traditionally, Mormon brides are 
allowed to wear their wedding dress in the temple for the ceremony, 
though without anything covering their face or head which meant that Ms 
Smart would have had to take off her beautiful, flowing lace veil.

After the ceremony, which took 
approximately 30-minutes, the  celebration continued as the group- which
 only included 12 guests- went to the Turtle Bay Resort for the wedding 
luncheon.

The elegant lunch highlighted the 
cuisine of the region, as the group of immediate family and a select few
 close friends dined on island fish in mango-papaya salsa, Huli Huli 
chicken, teriyaki steak and roasted Molokai sweet potatoes.

Mr Gilmour and Ms Smart then took a 
boat ride amid the beautiful Hawaiian surroundings as men in native garb
 rowed and played the uekelele.

That evening, the party continued at a
 luau where guests were treated to a buffet-style dinner of Lomi Lomi 
salmon and Kalua pig as well as some instructional hula dancing.

While the Hawaiian culture was seen throughout the day, Scottish customs were scattered throughout.

One such instance was the toast that 
Mr Gilmour gave at the luau, where he began with the traditional ‘On 
behalf of my wife and I’ introduction, which was met by a roar of cheers
 and clapping by the group.

Throughout the day, Ms Smart and Mr Gilmour continued wearing their wedding outfits.

The
 bride finally found her perfect dress- after trying ‘just about every 
dress in Utah’- off the rack at Kleinfelds bridal salon in New York.

She certainly isn’t the first would-be
 bride to have luck there: the store is the hub of activity on the TLC 
reality show Say Yes To The Dress.

In
 order to look appropriate on her wedding day, Ms Smart had the dress 
tulle dress retrofitted with lace sleeves and a demure neckline of 
scalloped lace.

Mr Gilmour 
represented his Scottish ancestry- and his father, who died in 2008 
after a battle with cancer- by wearing his dad’s kilt.

‘I
 wasn’t surprised Elizabeth was ready before Matthew because there is a 
lot to putting on a kilt,’ his uncle Neville Henderson said.

Announcement: The first glance of her ring came on a February 1 appearance on Good Morning America where she told the world that she was due to marry Mr Gilmour

Reception: After the Temple ceremony, the wedding guests and happy couple had lunch at the Turtle Bay Resort

The groom’s mother Kay made sure to 
let the other men get in on the action, as she brought ties for Mr 
Henderson and Elizabeth’s father that matched the same tartan as his 
kilt. 

Young love: The couple met while abroad on their missionary year in the south of France

Though their wedding was clearly a 
start of their new life together, the couple have visited each other’s 
hometowns and plan to settle in Salt Lake City where Mr Gilmour will 
attend university.

After their missionary year, the then-friends realized that they were bound for more and began dating.

The sparks really flew when she 
visited him in Scotland and they visited historic castles, getting a 
true sense of his heritage.

He followed suit by flying to Salt 
Lake City to spend time with her. While there, he asked for her father’s
 permission to propose, picked out the unique sapphire ring, and asked 
her the big question while they were out walking near her house.

‘The thing that attracted me the 
most-at the beginning and now- is how confident she is, especially 
considering everything she has been through,’ Mr Gilmour told People.

Venue: The couple married at the Laie Hawaii Temple, the first Mormon temple outside the U.S. mainland

Secret: The Hawaii wedding was planned just a week in advance thanks to intense media attention

The wasted no time planning after 
they were engaged, and while they originally wanted to get married in 
the summer in Salt Lake City, they switched to the Hawaiian option due 
to the massive amount of unexpected  media attention.

Instead, they rushed to get everything together in less than a month after he proposed.

'Elizabeth's desire was for what most 
women want — to celebrate her nuptials in a private wedding with family 
and close friends,' said family spokesman Chris Thomas.

'After the story broke about her 
engagement and the media became increasingly invasive, Elizabeth 
recognized it was going to be impossible to have a traditional wedding 
devoid of distractions and unusual challenges outside of her control.

Captors: Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee were both charged with various crimes for her kidnapping 

'She decided…the best way to avoid 
significant distraction was to change her wedding plans and to get 
married in an unscheduled ceremony outside of Utah.'

Though she has become an occasional 
ABC News contributor, Ms Smart has been wary of unwanted media attention
 since she first made headlines in 2002 when itinerant street preacher 
Brian David Mitchell broke into the Smart home and kidnapped her.

He and his wife Wanda Barzee held her 
for nine months, during which she was continuously raped and was even 
married to Mitchell in a bizarre ceremony.

In December, Ms Smart spoke out about 
the ordeal, saying: 'He went straight from marrying me to raping me. And
 after that moment I couldn't feel more worthless and more degraded. It 
was the worse feeling I could have ever felt.'

He was convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault and was sentenced to serve life in prison in May 2011.

Wanda Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in a Texas federal prison hospital for her role in the kidnapping of the girl.

Now, after testifying at their respective trials and even forgiving Mitchell of the atrocities he committed against her, she is determined to move on with her new life, accompanied by her husband throughout.

The couple were spotted on the Monday after their wedding, buying groceries at a local store while they enjoy their honeymoon at the same hotel that hosted their reception.

The National Enquirer quotes an insider as saying that they hope to start a family immediately and aim to have their first baby by their one-year anniversary.
