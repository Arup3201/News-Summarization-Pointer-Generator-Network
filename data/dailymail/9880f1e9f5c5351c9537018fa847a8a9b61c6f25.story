This is the touching moment a former college football player took to the field again - to propose to his girlfriend during half-time.

Calvin Mills, 37, convinced the marching band for his old team at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to join in for the occasion, spelling out 'MARRY ME' in huge letters during the half-time show.

The spectacle continued as a huge gift box was wheeled in containing the diamond ring he used to ask for the hand of Brittany Ramsey, 30, during a classic between Southern and visiting Grambling State University.

He was handed the rock by Ramsey's 12-year-old daughter, Ajaya, who sprung out of the enormous box with the a smaller version in her hand, before clambering out herself.

He also asked her to be his daughter in front of the 41,000-strong crowd.

After making sure he had permission from the youngest member of the family, Mills said: 'Now Brittany, would you do the honor of being my life, my friend, and - most of all - my wife?'

After overcoming her emotion, Ramsey accepted the offer and the crowd erupted in cheers.

According to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, the Superdome stadium in Baton Rouge has special significance for Mills, who is a Southern alumnus and was a forward for the university team from 1997 to 1999.

The pitch's Jumbotron lit up with 'She said Yes!' after the successful proposal, and the band continued the celebration as Mills and his new fiancée walked off the field.
