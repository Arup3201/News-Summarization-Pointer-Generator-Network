From the reasons why men cheat to why 
it's a good idea to get married, video blogger Emily Hartridge's 
laugh-out-loud videos have become an internet sensation.

This time, it's all about boobs.

'Hello lesbians, perverts, anyone who appreciates the female upper body. This topic is just for you,' says Emily.

While Emily modestly admits hers are 'not the best example' of breasts, she's still 'proud of them'.

In Emily's video '10 Reasons Why Boobs Are Awesome', reason three is 'They're pretty fun for boys to play with'

Her first reason for why breasts are so marvellous is that 'babies get free food from them'. To demonstrate, her 'assistant' Chris asks for milk from her breats for his coffee. Emily then apologies to the camera: 'Sorry, that was really disgusting.'

Reason two is: 'bras are an amazing place to store things, so we don't need to carry a bag with us'.

She illustrates this with a scene in which Chris asks for cab money - which Emily takes out from her 
bra. He then asks for a bottle opener which she pulls 
out from her cleavage. She continues producing items such as an umbrella and a cheese grater from her bra.

In Emily's video '10 Reasons Why Boobs Are Awesome', reason two is 'Bras are a great place to store things'

Emily sells Chris a blow up quiff (even though he already has one) to demonstrate reason eight: Boobs have phenomenal powers to control men

Reason five is: 'Boobs can really help in a job interview... but only if the person interviewing you is a man or a lesbian'.

During a comical mock job interview Emily pushes her chest in Chris' face and pulls a sympathy face.

Reason six is defined as: 'If you're having an ugly day you can detract the attention form your face'.

Emily walks into a room with a stuffed bra and make-up smudged all over her face and Chris thinks she looks wonderful.

With make-up smudged all over her face, Chris fails to notice due to the effects of reason six: 'If you're having an ugly day you can detract the attention form your face'

1. Babies get free food from them

2. Bras are an amazing place to store things, so we don't need to carry a bag with us

3. They're pretty fun for boys to play with

4. Scientifically boobs are very important to keep a girl standing upright

5. Boobs can really help in a job interview

6. If you're having an ugly day you can detract the attention form your face

7. Only women get to have them

8. Boobs have phenomenal powers to control men

9. After a long hard day at work nothing is as comforting a resting place for our weary heads as the cushion of a bosom

10. Boobs are pretty good for getting you laid

Another reason is: 'After a long hard day at work nothing is as comforting a resting place for our weary heads as the cushion of a bosom'.

Chris relaxes on her chest, while Emily says: 'Dad, what are you doing?'

She names reason ten as: 'Boobs are pretty good for getting you laid'.

This is illustrated as she dances with Chris, knocks him out with a boob, then drags him up to her bedroom.

The description of her video goes: 'Hi, I'm Emily, I take a wry look at the top 10 reasons why... a weekly show that proves that everything in the world can be explained with 10 reasons. You might not agree with everything I say and that's fine, my only intention is to provide you all with some much needed light entertainment.'

After discussing the 10 reasons boobs are awesome, Emily then discusses some of the comments on her video and shows some funny outtakes.

Thanks to her outrageous honesty and knack for comic timing, Emily's videos have gone viral with previous posts attracting millions of viewers. 

Along with her own Youtube channel, the 10 reasons why series is also shown on the Huffington Post website. 

Previous posts have included '10 reasons why...Men cheat', '10 reasons why...You should date a younger man' and '10 reasons why... You should NEVER get married'.
