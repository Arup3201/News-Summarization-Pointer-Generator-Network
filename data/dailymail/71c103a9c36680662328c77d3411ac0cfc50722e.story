Benfica have completed the signing of of Brazilian goalkeeper Julio Cesar on a two-year deal from QPR.

The 34-year-old signed for the London club in 2012 but made just 24 appearances before a loan move to Toronto.

Cesar was seen as a major coup for the club when he was signed from Inter Milan.

He signed a four-year deal at the club, who were focused on preserving their Premier League status and more.

But Cesar was in and out of the team, in competition with Green, and the club were eventually relegated under Harry Redknapp.

The experienced stopper impressed on loan in the MLS before excelling in the World Cup at first, saving the crucial penalty that saw Brazil through against Chile in the Second Round.

However, a 7-1 mauling at the hands of Germany somewhat put a dampner on his tournament.

He will now hope to kick on with the Portuguese champions.
