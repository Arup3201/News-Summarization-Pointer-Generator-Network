Authorities continue to search for a 9-year-old boy and his father, who has been charged with internationally kidnapping his son.

The FBI says Jeffrey Ford Hanson of Seattle could have sailed with his son, Billy Ginger Hanson, to Hawaii or other Pacific islands.

It's not known exactly when Hanson set sail from Seattle with Billy. They were last seen by authorities August 28.

The FBI doesn't know where they went, but Coast Guard nautical experts say they may have traveled to the Hawaiian islands and beyond 'based on the boat and Mr. Hanson's sailing abilities,' according to an FBI news release.

The experts didn't tell agents how long it would take the sailboat to arrive in Hawaii or elsewhere, said Ayn Dietrich, FBI spokeswoman in Seattle.

Billy was supposed to fly back to his mother in Pennsylvania on September 4 - though the FBI says he never boarded the flight.

Hanson is accused of abducting Billy from Shilshole Bay Marina.

Billy was last seen wearing black knee-length surf shorts, with no shirt or shoes.

FBI agents in Honolulu on Wednesday asked Hawaii's sailing community to look out for Hanson's 1976 White Cooper sailboat named 'Draco.'

A federal arrest warrant was issued for Hanson in September. 

'When I talked to Jeff he told me they were going to Blake Island,' Billy's mother Joanna Hanson told KIRO in September. 'I love my son, and I want him back.'

Last month, a Seattle FBI news release said 'They could be heading toward Mexico or islands in the South Pacific; however, the possibilities are endless.'

The Star Advertiser described Hanson as 'a known drug abuser with a volatile personality.'

'Our focus is on helping the agents at the Seattle FBI recover Billy safely, so he can go back to his mom where he belongs,' said Tom Simon, a FBI spokesman in Honolulu. 'Hawaii and the islands of the Pacific have a vibrant sailing and nautical community, and we are appealing to that community to be on the lookout for this sailboat and contact authorities with leads.'

The FBI said it is also contacting authorities in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and nations in the Pacific.

Hanson has been described by the FBI as standing being 5'5" tall and weighing 160 pounds, and Billy Hanson reportedly is 4 feet tall and weighs 90 pounds.
