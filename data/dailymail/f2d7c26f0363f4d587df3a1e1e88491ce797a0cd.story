Britain's bloated aid and climate change ministries have gone on a multi-million-pound recruitment spree since the last election.

The Department for International Development, which dishes out overseas aid, has employed in excess of 150 extra members of staff at a cost of more than £10million a year.

And despite David Cameron’s austerity drive, the Government has found the money to take on an extra 264 staff at the Department for Energy and Climate Change, with the roll call soaring by more than a quarter since 2010.

Their profligacy comes while other Whitehall ministries have had to make drastic cuts to bring down the deficit, leading to frontline services being slashed.

Both the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said their staff numbers had to rise so quickly to meet government ‘targets’.

At DECC, the total has increased by 26 per cent from 1,022 in April 2010 – just before the last election – to 1,286 in April last year, official figures released following a Parliamentary question reveal. The increase is even more startling when compared to April 2009 when just 768 were employed at the department. Since the election, DfID has swelled its ranks by 10 per cent. The 1,619 members of staff in December 2010 had increased to 1,773 by December 2012.

Figures released in the Lords last week show that in 2010/11, the total cost of DfID’s staff bill was £93.4million. The expected 2012/13 figure will be around £104.1million.

The news will outrage Tory backbenchers who have called on the Government to scrap its pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national output on overseas aid, and abandon its obsession with wind power.

Priti Patel, the Conservative MP who obtained the figures following Parliamentary questions, said: ‘Families up and down the country making sacrifices and having their living standards squeezed will be astonished to see low priority government departments spending their hard-earned taxes on more staff.

‘The civil service needs to become more efficient and effective at deploying the resources it has. During these tough economic times government departments should be leading the way by reducing their sizes not taking taxpayers for granted and bringing in more bureaucrats.’

Three other departments – Work and Pensions, the Cabinet Office and Wales – have also seen staff rises, although this is because staff from abolished quangos went to work for the core department.

Critics said that if an organisation was worthy of abolition, its jobs should go too – otherwise people would believe the ‘bonfire of the quangos’ was little more than a damp squib.

A spokesman for DfID said that its 
extra staff were not bureaucrats sitting in Whitehall but people working
on the frontline in poor countries.

She
added: ‘DfID has cut 30 per cent from its admin budget. Since 2010 the 
department has undergone major restructuring involving recruitment of 
additional frontline staff to make sure our development programmes are 
delivered efficiently as we reach the 0.7 per cent target.’

A
DECC spokesman said: ‘DECC has a challenging and important agenda, and 
the posts that have been filled are necessary to enable us to meet those
targets.’

A Cabinet Office 
spokesman said that overall, the number of civil servants across 
Whitehall stands at 420,000 – a post-war low and down 15 per cent since 
the election.

Concerns: Justine Greening

Aid to Rwanda will be funnelled through charities rather than the country’s scandal-hit government, Justine Greening said yesterday.

The International Development Secretary said the UK will give £16million to Rwanda, after earlier halting the aid because of the central African state’s support for brutal rebels in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The money will not be paid directly to the Rwandan treasury as initially planned but instead to aid agencies in the country.

The announcement comes six months after Miss Greening’s predecessor, Andrew Mitchell, reinstated payments to the Rwandan government despite growing human rights concerns.

On his last day in the job he authorised £8million as direct support to the government, and diverted the other half to specific development programmes.

He acted despite a UN report last July highlighting Rwanda’s role in backing insurgents in DRC.

Miss Greening decided in November to withhold the money amid renewed concerns about Rwanda president Paul Kagame’s actions.

Violence in Congo has been spiralling, with reports of summary executions being carried out by the rebel M23 group.

Miss Greening said £16million would now be paid in to Rwanda but not through its government.

Some of the cash will also be paid into a ringfenced fund which will be divided among the country’s poorest workers.

Miss Greening said money would provide work opportunities for 545,000, support essential services, fund 1.8million school books and help 20,000 refugees in camps on the Rwanda side of the border with Congo.
