Swansea City are keen on Celtic centre-back Virgil van Dijk.

The 22-year-old is highly valued by the Scottish champions but Swansea are willing to offer around £6million.

Swansea are awaiting offers for midfielder Michu who has not travelled on the pre-season tour to USA but they will also offload Chico Flores.

It may worry the Swans, though, that Celtic No 2 John Collins insisted only a ‘crazy’ bid could persuade the club to part with leading assets such as Van Dijk.

La Liga outfit Sevilla have been linked with a £6m offer, while Southampton are also interested following the appointment of Ronald Koeman as manager.

Parkhead chief executive Peter Lawwell is adamant, however, that there is no financial need to sell and believes it would be best for Van Dijk to stay at least another season with Scottish champions.

Collins echoed that stance last week as the squad flew out to their pre-season training camp in Austria, stating that no offers have been made as yet.
