A motorist was charged by police after driving up Snowdon in a 4X4 - and then did it again just weeks later when his 'stubbornness and sheer stupidity got the better of him,' a jury heard today.

Craig Williams, 40, of Cheltenham, denies driving dangerously on footpaths and the mountain railway on September 3, 2011 - and then again three weeks later.

Outlining the case at Caernarfon Crown Court, where the trial started in Mr Williams' absence, prosecuting counsel Matthew Curtis said on the first occasion a Vauxhall Frontera was found parked 200 metres from the 3,560ft summit.

Mr Williams had approached police who went up the mountain by railway and confessed to driving the vehicle.

Mr Curtis said it was alleged that it was impossible for a car to be driven solely on the footpath.

'It would have had to go on the railway track,' he said, adding there was concern that the points mechanism might have been damaged.

He continued: 'Whichever way the vehicle was driven up it was dangerous. The greatest risk might have been to the defendant himself.

'The car could easily have slipped, overturned or gone over the edges.'

'In interview the defendant said he woke up early in the morning and decided to drive up Snowdon.

'He drove only on the paths and not the railway tracks.'

Mr Williams said he drove up the the Llanberis path and acknowledged the weather was severe and visibility limited, the court heard.

The vehicle was removed on September 8 and returned to him.

But on the morning of September 29 it was found abandoned on top of the summit complex.

There was some damage to the railway and summit path and the vehicle was emblazoned with signs advertising it for sale on eBay.

Glued to a window was a sign saying : 'I have made it to the summit' and another stating : 'Hello everyone and welcome to the highest point in England and Wales. My name is Trusty and I am a little legend.'

Mr Curtis said Williams denied driving the vehicle on this occasion. Williams claimed the Frontera had vanished while he was 'wild camping'.

A note was on a bed at a Llanberis bunkhouse where he was staying which stated: 'Beat you'.

However, Mr Curtis said on the night of September 14 the defendant was seen driving near to the Hebron station of the Snowdon Mountain Railway by an off-duty police sergeant.

He added: 'The prosecution say this was, on the part of the defendant, clearly reconnaissance. He was there to recce the mountain to help him perhaps complete the feat he hadn't perhaps achieved on the first occasion.'

The prosecution said by driving on the railway at certain points it could have caused damage with 'catastrophic consequences'.

The prosecution also said it was a 'deliberate and considered' act to gain further attention and complete what might not have been achieved the first time. It was Williams' intention to return and drive it down, it was alleged.

Williams had also allegedly bragged to a woman that he would go up again.

Prosecutors said the ascent was 'sheer stupidity' as he could easily overturned or plunged down the mountain

Louise Griffith, a cleaner at the summit building, said she saw Williams on September 28 and recognised him from the TV news following his first ascent of the peak in a 4x4.

'He said it took him about six hours and he didn't drive it on the railway track,' she said in evidence.

'He said the weather was terrible. The wind was blowing and he was driving sometimes on two wheels and he was hanging off the cliff with the vehicle.'

The defendant said if he got away with the first incident he would do it again, she claimed.

Questioned by defence barrister Brian Treadwell, Miss Griffith said : 'He was making out he was a cool guy.'

Aled Taylor, a retired national park warden, said : 'Around Clogwyn station area the risks would be quite dangerous to the driver himself plus to anyone else who was walking on that path at that time.'

It was a long way down to Llanberis Pass if the vehicle went over the edge, he added.

He was charged with an offence after the first incident and bailed. The prosecutor added that 'his stubbornness and sheer stupidity got the better of him' and he went up again.

The case continues.
