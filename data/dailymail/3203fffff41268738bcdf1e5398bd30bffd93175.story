Leeann Dempster has urged angry Hibs fans to focus on her bid to turn the ailing club around - instead of channelling their energies into ousting embattled chairman Rod Petrie.

In her first extensive interview since becoming chief executive at Easter Road, Dempster assured sceptical supporters that she would be given complete freedom to do her job, without interference from the unpopular Petrie.

And she cast doubt over Terry Butcher’s future as manager by refusing to confirm the Englishman would still be in charge of the relegated outfit when they kick off next season in the Championship.

In charge: Leeann Dempster has assured Hibs fans that she will be in complete control of the club

Former Motherwell CEO Dempster, who only began work as Petrie’s successor on Monday, insisted she would prefer to  hold formal talks with Butcher first before deciding which direction the club would be taking in a highly-competitive second tier featuring Rangers and city rivals Hearts.

Her arrival in Leith has coincided with the launch of a ‘Petrie Out’ campaign - fronted by a number of prominent former players and supporters’ organisations in an attempt to oust the 58-year-old from his non-executive role. A rally is planned for this morning outside the stadium, where Dempster is scheduled to meet a cross-section of fans represented on the Working Together umbrella group.

However, she ‘categorically’ rejected fears from supporters - who blame Petrie for the club’s relegation - that she will not be allowed to bring about the changes necessary.

Asked in an extensive interview what she made of the row that had greeted her arrival at the club, Dempster said: ‘It’s not been as I anticipated, let’s put it that way. It’s been a challenging first few days, quite possibly the most challenging a new CEO could face, but I’m not fazed by it.

‘We find ourselves in a very challenging position and we need to refocus, but it is what it is; I can’t change anything. I just need to get on with the job.’

In response to whether she would be allowed to conduct the changes she wants, she added: ‘I can be quite clear on that. I was running a football club, and let’s be honest a very successful football club, and when I was approached to come here that was one of my main concerns. Am I going to have the autonomy to go and do the job, the job that is required at this football club?

‘Let’s be frank, Hibernian hasn’t had the best on-field results in the last couple of years. It’s a matter of fact, we haven’t performed the way we need to. I saw an opportunity to come in and improve on that.

On his way? There is no guarantee that Terry Butcher will still be manager at Easter Road next season

‘I wasn’t going to walk away from a job where I had complete autonomy, the absolute support of the chairman to actually do the job that was required, the absolute support of the board to do the job required, to walk into another post where my hands were going to be tied.

‘I think I’ve got enough integrity, and I would certainly hope reputation, that people would know I wouldn’t do that.

‘I’ve got the ball now, the responsibility is on me, the focus needs to go on me.

‘The choices I make and the recommendations I make to the board are going to be the ones which are hopefully going to take the club forward and which I will be judged on.

‘To say that the chairman needs to go is, in my view, quite a simplistic approach and actually probably quite an unfair one.

‘I’m picking up the baton, if you like, and it’s me that is going to have to take that responsibility.

‘We’ve got a board of directors, we operate independently, and part of my viewpoint here is we have to start acting more like a football club than a corporate entity, and that is the direction I want to take us in.

‘Is it going to be my way forward? Categorically. I can be asked that question any number of times and it will be the same answer, and I have to be judged on that.’

Dempster was less clear on the future of Butcher, who was widely perceived to have escaped the axe despite presiding over the team’s relegation.

The pair met last week when a number of players were being freed, but at that point Dempster was still officially an employee of Motherwell.

She insisted that discussions with the Englishman - who arrived at the club in November when Hibs were seventh in the table - would not have been appropriate at that time.

The duo have since spoken on the phone but will meet in person next week.

Responding to a question on whether Butcher would still be in charge next season, Dempster pointedly failed to take the opportunity to firm up the former Motherwell and Inverness manager’s position.

She told Hibernian TV: ‘I met Terry for the first time in the capacity of him being the Hibernian manager last week when I went to the training facility. At that time emotions were obviously very high and relegation had just happened.

‘I was still CEO of Motherwell at that point, so no decisions or formal discussions could take place.

‘So, Terry went off to finish his family holiday and has since come back. We’ve spoken on a few occasions since and there are plans to meet Terry next week.

‘Once we’ve had that conversation and we’ve come to a conclusion on the direction of the club I can come out and talk.

‘But it was far too early to say I would do anything at that point and as my previous role was still intact it wasn’t appropriate either.’
