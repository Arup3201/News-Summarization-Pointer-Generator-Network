Health scare: Ted Turner was rushed to a remote clinic in Patagonia and treated for appendicitis

hospital stay in Buenos Aires he was 'admitted to a local hospital for 
observation' on Friday morning.

Clinic workers in Patagonia told Reuters that he was well enough to leave on foot.

'Given it is our policy not to comment on his personal health, no further details will be provided,' Turner's spokesman Phillip Evans told CNN.

He does not have a history of poor health and has remained physically active.

Turner is known for his love of the outdoors and he owns property in Patagonia.

The Ohio native is said to have 15 ranches around the globe, with the vast majority in the continental United States.
