England has reclaimed rugby league superstar Slammin' Sam Burgess, one of the four remarkable brothers who have made a new life in Australia following their father's tragic and untimely death from motor neurone disease.

Australian rugby league is in shock as the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) pulled off the coup, paying a rumoured £500,000 to buy Burgess out of his contract as captain of foundation club, the South Sydney Rabbitohs.

The news is also a blow to Australian girls, who have gone mad for Sam and his three brothers, who have a been as big a hit on the playing field as they have on the Sydney social scene.

The raid is a setback for the club's main shareholder, New Zealand-born Hollywood star Russell Crowe, who took a personal interest in hiring all four Dewsbury-born brothers to play in Australia, which has the toughest rugby league competition in the world.

However, the player's manager, James Erskine, said Crowe would not stand in the way of Sam Burgess's dream to play for his home country in next year's World Cup Rugby tournament in England.

Crowe went 'out of his way' to help the brothers, followed by their widowed mother, Julie, to relocate three years ago to Sydney.

Sam, 25, elder brother Luke, 26, and 21-year-old twins, Tom and George, have been a footballing and media sensation for the club, known as 'Souths'.

Tom and George have also been approached to play for England in the World Cup, but Sam is the only brother who is planning to switch codes entirely and leave South Sydney to play club rugby in the UK.

Julie Burgess now works as a teacher for private Sydney boys school, The Scots College, and has revelled in her new life in Australia, six years after losing her husband.

Mark Burgess, a rugby league footballer who played for clubs in Manchester, Nottingham and Yorkshire, was aged only 45 when he succumbed to motor neurone disease six years ago.

In a documentary made by Russell Crowe, Sam recalled the number of steps - 21 - he had to take when carrying his father upstairs to his bedroom while he was dying.

It was a journey he made so often that the number is still etched in Sam's mind.

The tragedy pulled the family closer together. When Russell Crowe head-hunted Sam to sign him over from the Bradford Bulls to South Sydney, the family soon followed and have taken well to life in Australia.

In the summer they go to the beach and were recently photographed in buff form on the sands.

In the winter, they play football. Last year, with all four brothers on board, the Souths club scored its best season in decades, narrowly missing out on making the grand final. The Burgess brothers formed one of the strongest forward packs in the competition.

Australian girls went mad for the brothers, who were snapped up by some of the country's most glamorous women.

Luke and girlfriend Yolanda Hodgson, who made the top 10 on Australia's Next Top Model in 2011, last year welcomed their first child, Grace Luca Burgess.

Sam Burgess romanced X Factor star, Joelle Hadjia, although the pair split last December.

Tom is dating Miss Universe Australia, Laura Dundovic.

Australians hearts went out to the boys when Fox Sports broadcast a documentary about the family, with footage of Sam recalling his father's slow painful death and footage of him visiting his grave in the UK.

The film also features Russell Crowe presenting a tearful Sam Burgess before his first game for South Sydney with a Rabbitohs membership card bearing his father’s name.

In the film, Crowe talks about how he admires the Burgess men's dedication to playing rugby league, and the special moment when all four brothers played together  last year for the first time.

It was also a special moment for rugby league's proudest football mother, Julie Burgess.

'This weekend I’ve got just one game (to go to) in the same place for the first time ever,’’ she said afterward.

Sam's decision to part ways with his adopted country comes as he is in England with his brothers for the funeral of their grandfather.

The 25-year-old advised Crowe that English rugby authorities had approached him to switch codes while he was in Britain for the Rugby League World Cup last year.

He told Crowe he was excited about playing for England rugby union's biggest tournament. He has changed his Twitter profile to: 'just a Yorkshire lad living in Sydney right now. I've got the best family in the world'.

Burgess has accepted an offer from an Aviva Premiership club — understood to be Bath — and his departure from league will be confirmed once financial terms have been finalised.

Sam has spoken of the debt all four brothers owe their late father.

‘He was bulky, really big, with wide shoulders, just under six feet,’ recalled Sam. ‘A typical front rower with big, massive legs, like a square. My mum’s 6ft 1in, so we have some good genes.’

Mother Julie, 51, acknowledges they are a close knit family and living in Australia has been good for them

'The boys are so close and they always have been,' she said.

'Luke has always been the bossiest, Sam the happiest and Tom did all his talking for his twin George, who is the quietest. Their bond is still the same. Losing their father in their teens was a traumatic experience and it has definitely brought them closer.

‘They really look after each other and they look after me now. We live within 10 minutes of each other and often get together for dinner, three or four times a week.'
