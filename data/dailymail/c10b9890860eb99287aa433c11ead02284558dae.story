Arsenal target William Carvalho has revealed he is desperate to move to the Premier League.

The Gunners failed with an initial offer £15m last summer for the midfielder after Sporting slapped a £30m price tag on his head.

The Portuguese club are ready to reopen talks with Arsenal willing to pay £20m and his agent Jorge Mendes is trying to broker a deal.

Carvalho told Portuguese publication Record: 'My dream is to play in England. I know some clubs are interested but my agent Jorge is looking after it and I am relaxed.

'Now my mission is to work in Sporting and they will be in charge of any transfer and my future. That is very important.' 

Talks between the two clubs broke down in the autumn after Carvalho was valued at £30m by his Portuguese team.

Arsene Wenger is open to buying reinforcements in the January window

But with Arsene Wenger taking Arsenal through to the Champions League knockout stages, where they face Monaco, the importance of solving their well-documented defensive problems have increased. Carvalho, 22, is one of the very few top international-class players who will probably be available in January. 

Sporting were eliminated from the Champions League by losing their final group game against Chelsea on December 10 and though they will be in the Europa League, they are willing to cash in on their biggest asset. 

Arsenal's initial offer of £15m two months ago was dismissed but the negotiations ended on friendly terms. Arsenal have been playing Mathieu Flamini in front of the back four with Jack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta out injured.

Carvalho can also play at centre back. The youngster played in two of Portugal's three games at the World Cup and was also linked with Manchester United, although they have since signed Daley Blind.
