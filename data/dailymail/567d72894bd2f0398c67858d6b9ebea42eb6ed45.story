He's known for his offbeat humour, and that's exactly what won over audiences when Adam Sandler took the stage at the 12-12-12 Hurricane Sandy benefit concert on Wednesday night.

The comedian grabbed the mic after Pink Floyd's Roger Waters and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder for a creative rendition of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah.

Below the spotlights at Madison Square Garden - before thousands who weathered Superstorm Sandy when it slammed the East Coast in October - Sandler had a few choice words to deliver.

'Sandy, screw ya!' echoed through the arena, inciting a chorus of cheers from the crowd.

Paul Shaffer played piano while the comedian earned belly laughs with his inspired lyrics.

Hearkening back to his Saturday Night Live days with a ribald rewrite, he continued: 'Sandy, screw ya, we'll get through ya, because 
we're New Yawkers.'

Bruce Springsteen & the E Street 
Band kicked off the star-studded show on Wednesday with a rocking rendition of Land of Hope and 
Dreams.

The band opened the concert with 
their patriotic 1999 hit, while music royalty from the Rolling Stones to
Kanye West, and several artists with direct ties to the New York 
metropolitan area hit by Superstorm Sandy, prepared to take the stage.

The acts are gathering at Madison Square Garden for a sold-out show to help victims affected by the disaster.

Before the E Street Band took the stage, the crowd was shown a documentary about the destruction left by Hurricane Sandy.

Springsteen got them up with a short rendition of People Get Ready and Wrecking Ball, which references his native New Jersey.

Jon
Bon Jovi joined the rocker during his set, and the pair brought the 
crowd to their feet with Born To Run before Billy Crystal took the mic 
from the stage floor, noting New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and New 
York Governor Andrew Cuomo were in the crowd.

Pink
Floyd's Roger Waters and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder followed, sending the
crowd into an uproar with Another Brick in the Wall, which saw a group 
of young dancers join them on stage.

The
dancers wore black and white shorts reading 'Fear Builds Walls', 
pumping their fists during a guitar solo, and taking a bow as the lights
dimmed.

The pair performed a duet of Comfortably Numb before Sandler took the stage, guitar in hand.

Later on, Billy Crystal again took the mic, introducing Kristen Stewart, who flew in from Los Angeles for the concert.

The actress, after urging audiences to vote, introduced Bon Jovi for another set.

Performances by Eric Clapton, Dave Grohl, Billy Joel, Alicia Keys, Chris Martin, The Rolling Stones, Kanye West The Who and Paul McCartney followed.

The 12-12-12 concert is 
being shown on 37 television stations in the United States and more than
200 others worldwide. It will be streamed on 30 websites, including on 
YouTube and Yahoo, and played on radio stations.

Adding some flair: Waters performs with a masked dancer

Theaters,
including 27 in the New York region and dozens more elsewhere, will 
also show it live. More than two billion people are expected to have 
access to the performance.

Proceeds from the show will be distributed through the Robin Hood Foundation.

The late October storm left parts of 
New York City underwater and millions of people in several states 
without heat or electricity for weeks. Sandy is blamed for at least 125 
deaths, including 104 in New York and New Jersey, and destroyed or 
damaged 305,000 housing units in New York alone.

Concert performers Bruce Springsteen and
Bon Jovi are native sons of New Jersey, where boardwalks and beach 
homes were ripped apart. Long Islander Billy Joel ('New York State of 
Mind') and New Yorker Alicia Keys ('Empire State of Mind') have 
signature songs about the city. Even Liverpool's Paul McCartney has a 
New York office, Hamptons home and a wife, Nancy Shevell, who spent a 
decade on the board of the agency that runs New York's public transit 
system.

Impassioned: Alicia Keys took the stage for a heartfelt performance

Moving: Keys, from New York, performed a medley of her hits

Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones wasn't in New York for the storm but has an apartment in the city that was flooded with some two feet of water, he said.

'Imagine you hadn't known it was coming,'
he said in an interview. 'It would have been pretty dire. I think it's 
good to do events to support people in the area where you're very 
familiar with. I mean, I've been coming here for a long time.'

Other artists expected to perform include Eric Clapton, Dave Grohl, Chris Martin, Roger Waters, Eddie Vedder and the Who.

Set-up: 12-12-12 will be available to all 114 million television households in the US and to more than 400 million television households outside the country

For a good cause: Every single penny from ticket purchases and donations will go to organizations serving the victims of Hurricane Sandy through the Robin Hood Relief Fund

It's
a lineup heavily weighted toward classic rock, which has the type of 
fans able to afford a show where ticket prices ranged from $150 to 
$2,500. Even with those prices, people with tickets have been offering 
them for more on broker sites like StubHub, an attempt at profiteering 
that producers fumed was 'despicable.'

Celebrities like Jimmy Fallon, Adam Sandler, Jon Stewart, Sean Combs, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brian Williams will also be on hand to tell stories about the storm and take pledges for donations.

The concert comes a day after the death of sitar master Ravi Shankar, a performer at the 1971 'Concert for Bangladesh' considered the grandfather of music benefits. It was also in Madison Square Garden.
