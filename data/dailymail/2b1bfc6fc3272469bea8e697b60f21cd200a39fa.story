A British port is in the running to dismantle the Costa Concordia, a mega-contract expected to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds.

Able Seaton Port on Teeside, near Hartlepool, has been asked to submit a proposal for the vast demolition project, which is expected to take 200 people two years to complete. It estimated value of the contract is more than Euro 300million.

The wreck of the stricken cruise liner is still stranded off the island of Giglio where it struck rocks and sank, killing 32 people.

Almost two years on from the tragedy, the stricken hull is almost set to be towed away from the Mediterranean holiday island

Captain Francesco Schettino was allegedly performing an ill judged 'salute' to the islander when the giant ship ran aground.

Almost two years on from the tragedy, the stricken hull is almost set to be towed away from the Mediterranean holiday island, the salvage team said.

Its destination is still undecided. A final judgement will be taken in March but some eight ports are in contention including Able Port on the River Tees, among others in Italy, Norway, Turkey, China and France.

Able UK confirmed that it was in the tender process and said that its yard had previously recycled both a French aircraft carrier and US Government vessels.

'The facility, including one of the world's largest dry docks, has full planning permissions and environmental accreditations to undertake this type of activity. The previous contracts were completed in October 2010 and employed over 100 personnel,' it said.

Altogether 12 companies have been invited to bid for the job of breaking up, scrapping and recycling the vessel

Italy’s environment minister Andrea Orlando told reporters that although it was the government's preferred choice that the contract go to an Italian bidder, it was not in a position to make any demands.

'Naturally the port of destination is not unimportant to us, for many reasons,' he said, adding that given the environmental challenges it was preferable for the ship to be towed to a port nearby.

But there are question marks over the suitability of several of the four Italian docks- which might need huge renovations to prepare them for the size of the task.

The 114,000-ton ship was wrested from the rocks in September last year in a complicated 19-hour salvage operation, the largest and most expensive of its kind.

More than 1,000 concrete stacks and six underwater platforms are being used to keep the vessel stable.

To tow the cruise ship away, Costa has rented for three months, at a cost of Euro 30 million euro, the Dockwise Vanguard, the largest semi-submersible vessel in the world.

Michael Thamm, chief executive officer of Costa Crociere, said: 'We are very confident that we can remove this ship within the month of June. This is not very far away - and then a great job will be done.'

Mr Thamm said he expected the cost of the Costa Concordia salvage effort to reach €600m (£496m) by the time it was removed from Giglio.

News of the tender came as Giglio prepares to mark the two year anniversary of the disaster on Monday with a mass and concert commemorating those who lost their lives.
