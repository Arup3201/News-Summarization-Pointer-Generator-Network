Cruel: Craig Curtis, 27, has been jailed for 18 weeks after he battered his dog with a baseball bat because it urinated on the floor

A cruel dog owner hanged his six-month-old puppy by its collar and then beat it to death with a baseball bat because it had wet the carpet, a court heard.

In what the RSPCA say is one of the most shocking cases they've seen, Craig Curtis, 27, strung Staffordshire bull terrier Bruno from his weightlifting bench after the pup urinated on the floor.

Curtis has been jailed after he 'went ballistic' and battered the tiny dog, then put its lifeless body in his freezer before dumping him later in nearby woodland.

Cambridge Magistrates’ Court heard Bruno’s body was found wrapped in blood-stained sheets by a dog walker who immediately called the RSPCA.

Officers traced the tragic pet back to Curtis, who lives in Exning, Suffolk, who was then arrested and charged.

He has pleaded guilty to cruelty charges under the Animal Welfare Act.

Sentencing him to 18 weeks in jail, magistrate Phil King said: 'Mr Starr [prosecuting] has described this as one of the worst cases he has ever seen and the bench must agree with him having seen the photographs.

'This is absolutely appalling. You are shaking your head and I think you agree with me.'

Curtis’ crime was uncovered when Bruno, a male brindle and white Staffordshire bull terrier was found in the woods on March 25 this year.

The RSPCA initally believed Bruno had been poisoned due to the large amount of blood around his nose and mouth.

But a post mortem revealed he had suffered fractures to his skull and died after being struck around the head with a blunt instrument.

Shockingly tests also revealed that Bruno was alive for a long period while the attack on him took place, and also a child could have been in the house at the time.

Robert Starr, prosecuting, said: 'This is easily the nastiest case I have come across, certainly the most violent and the most deliberate.

'This was a malicious, deliberate act. This man should not be left in charge of animals.'

RSPCA inspector Richard Lithgoe, who investigated the case, said: 'This was easily the most shocking case of cruelty I have ever seen.

'This is a horrendously violent man - I was so shocked at how ferocious and brutal this attack was.

'This poor young dog was victim to a senseless brutality and would have been in an extreme amount of pain.

The worst part is he was alive when this attack took place and so would have suffered a long, lingering, gruesome death.'

Jacqui Baldwin, mitigating, said there was a child living in the home and the dog’s behaviour had worsened and there were concerns it might go further.

'As far as he was concerned, the dog was ordinarily a well-behaved dog but it started to turn,' she said.

Ms Baldwin said Curtis had 'taken on board quite a bit of alcohol' since starting to suffer from depression and alcoholism, which had clouded his judgment on that occasion.

She said he had since taken part in alcohol and drug awareness courses and 'shows a substantial amount of remorse.'
