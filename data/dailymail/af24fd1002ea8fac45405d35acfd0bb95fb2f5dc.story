While Harry Kane was celebrating his first senior England call-up on Thursday, Burnley’s Danny Ings had to be content with a place in the Under 21 squad to face Germany and the Czech Republic.

Ings has emerged as one of the most exciting strikers in the country alongside Kane this season, and is attracting interest from both Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Real Sociedad as his contract at Turf Moor runs down.

Burnley manager Sean Dyche says he will be ‘amazed’ if Ings is not rewarded by Roy Hodgson soon.

‘I don’t think it will affect him not being included,’ said Dyche.

‘He’s said to me, “I think I’ve got a big chance”. He’ll just get on with it. I’d be amazed if he doesn’t get recognised enough to get in the main squad as long as he has the will and desire to train and continue learning, because that’s where careers are built.’

Meanwhile, Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey feels Charlie Austin was more deserving than Kane of a place in Hodgson’s squad.

‘He is doing it in a team that is struggling at the foot of the table and he has still scored quite a few goals this season,’ said Ramsey.

‘It goes to show that he is a quality player and he will shine wherever he plays.’
