Hugh Jackman headed to the gym on Saturday and got more than what he bargained for.

The 44-year-old actor went to Gotham Gym in West Village, New York, where a woman confronted him inside as he was working out.

Kathleen Thurston, 47, ran past the front desk in hysterics, crying and shouting that she loved the X-Men star, according to reports.

'The razor fell out of her hands when I stepped in between them,' Mike Castle, a trainer at the gym, told police.

Hugh asked the woman not to touch him, according to NYPD spokesman Sgt Tom Antonelli.

Kathleen left the gym as soon as security arrived.

She was arrested a few blocs away from the facility and charged with stalking.

'Here's a woman who obviously needs help so I just hope she get the help she needs,' the actor toldÂ CBS New York correspondent Carol D'Auria.

Jackman was reportedly shaken by the incident, fearing that the woman was grabbing for a weapon when she reached into her pants.

The New York Post reported that the woman's address is listed as a Harlem shelter for the mentally ill.

The Les Miserables star has had more than just one run-in with this stalker.

Jackman has also seen the woman outside his seven-year-old daughter's elementary school in Manhattan and outside his home in the West Village, where he lives with his wife Deborra-Lee Furness.

'I suppose for me, the primary concern is my family, obviously,' the actor told CBS New York regarding his stalker.

Jackman's next role will have him donning the adamantium claws again in James Mangold's The Wolverine.

The actor is currently beefing up for yet another turn as Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past.
