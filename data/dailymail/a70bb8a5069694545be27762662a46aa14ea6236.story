Driving ban: Alison Baker, 60, was allowed by a judge to attend the classes she used to run

A motorist who ran drink-drive awareness classes has been banned from the road after being caught three times over the limit.

But Alison Baker, of Pinhoe, Devon, was allowed by a judge to attend the course she used to run - which would see her ban reduced by a quarter if completed.

The 60-year-old had twice driven to her local petrol station to buy bottles of wine within a couple of hours of one morning last May.

But the garage cashier was concerned she was not in a fit state to drive on the second visit and told police, Exeter Magistrates’ Court heard.

Officers turned up at her home, and when she eventually answered the door she was so drunk she had to grip walls and furniture to stand up.

Baker had denied drink-driving but was convicted after a trial last month, before being banned from the road for two years yesterday.

In an account rejected by a district judge, she blamed the high reading on post-driving consumption and said she had downed one and a half bottles of wine in about ten minutes before the police came to her home.

Yesterday, Sonia Croft, prosecuting, said Baker was a trainer on drink-drive courses and should not be allowed her to attend such classes.

She claimed that Baker would know all about the course and gain nothing from it. But Vanessa Francis, defending, said this claim by prosecutors was 'spiteful and unnecessarily punitive'.

She said this was Baker's first drink-driving offence and it would be unfair to refuse a first-time offender the chance to go on the course. District Judge Stephen Nicholls accepted this request.

He banned her from driving for 26 months - but that could fall by 26 weeks if she passes the course by August 2016. She was also given an 18-month community order and told to pay £430 in costs.

Miss Francis said Baker was involved in drink-drive courses in the local area for three years - but was made redundant three years ago because of the rise in the number of privately-run providers.

During her trial Baker - who ran the classes for Devon County Council - denied using her intimate professional knowledge of alcohol units and driving to 'tailor her defence'.

She did not contest the high reading - 104mg of alcohol in her breath when the legal limit is 35mg - but claimed a defence of drinking after she had parked her blue Chevrolet Kalos car. 

Baker admitted decanting wine from bottles so she could hide them from her husband. 

She said she used alcohol for pain relief for arthritis and suffered problems with her knees, legs and wrist. The defendant said she drank herself into 'oblivion'  and would down alcohol until she passed out.

Baker hid the empty bottles of wine - placing some of them in equipment she used for her drink drive awareness courses.

She denied being over the limit, saying she only had two units of alcohol between trips, but admitted: ’I can't remember the police coming to the house.’
