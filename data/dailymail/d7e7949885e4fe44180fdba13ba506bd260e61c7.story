A toddler could have been killed after an e-cigarette exploded 'like a firework' inches from his head, his parents said today.

Alfie Worthington was playing in a bedroom when the e-cigarette, which was re-charging on a table, burst into flames and flew off 'like a Catherine wheel'.

His mother Frankie Worthington, 22, from Norwich, said the explosion could have killed her 20-month-old son.

She said: 'Thank goodness the table was in the way. If it hadn't been there in the way Alfie wouldn't be here now. That's the frightening thing of it - that took a lot of the blast.

Scorched: The e-cigarette exploded 'like a firework' and damaged the wall, carpet and table it was charging on

'The e-cigarette just exploded for no apparent reason. It was like a firework going off in here.'

The  mother-of-one added: 'It was on fire and I dialled 999 - the e-cigarette is just obliterated. It just blew up.'

She ran downstairs to get a bowl of water as her husband Grant, 24, pushed the bed away to stop the blaze spreading through the room.

'It was like a Catherine wheel,' added Mrs Worthington.

Escape: Alfie was playing inches away from where the device burst into flames

'It was just a white glow of sparks. I grabbed Alfie, who was screaming, and Grant jumped over the bed - he put some of the fire out with his hands.'

The e-cigarette had been on charge all night before it exploded on Saturday morning  and the couple had just woken up.

Mr Worthington, an engineer, said: 'If it had happened when we were out or asleep, heaven forbid.

'It could have been so much worse.

'The whole house could have gone up in flames.'

A fire engine from Sprowston arrived at 7.35am after Frankie raised the alarm but they had already put the fire out.

He said firefighters took thermal images to ensure the scene was safe while he's warned Trading Standards in a bid to prevent a future tragedy.

He said they bought the increasingly-popular e-cigarette at a shop in Norwich in August and it did not have any instructions with it.

'It was nasty and frightening. The room quickly became a ball of smoke. People need to be aware,' he added.

It came as  Linda James-Davies' Cardiff house was gutted by fire and she believes an e-cigarette charger was to blame.

The mother-of-two inspects her damaged possessions and says she is  convinced the device exploded while she ate beans on toast in her two-bedroom house

The mother-of-two was convinced the device exploded while she ate beans on toast in her two-bedroom house.

'All of a sudden the fire alarm went off,' Linda said. 'I thought it had gone off accidentally but when I opened my bedroom door the room was alight.'

The device was plugged in while the 56-year-old had a bath before her snack.

'I could see the fire was around the charger, which was plugged into an extension lead,' she said.

'That was where the fire was from. The fire officer said it was down to the e-cigarette when they put the fire out. My upstairs is gutted.'

In August a man was killed in Liverpool after a charging e-cigarette exploded and ignited oxygen equipment he was believed to have been using.
