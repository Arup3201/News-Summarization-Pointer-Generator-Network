A former Royal Marine soldier who was fired by Sir Alan Sugar on the Apprentice has pleaded guilty to punching a taxi driver while drunk.

Chris Farrell was thrown out of the taxi on November 22 after calling the driver a p****, Wirral Magistrates Court heard today.

The 31-year-old who appeared on the sixth series of the TV show in 2010 was on his way home with his partner after drinking a bottle of wine and a few beers.

The taxi driver said he had been assaulted by a male and female according to prosecutor Alan Currums.

He said: 'As he [taxi driver] approached the female he says he was punched in the face by the defendant.

'He said he was called 'a p****'. The taxi driver stopped the vehicle on the hard shoulder to call police.'

'The defendant had drunk a bottle of wine and a few beers but wouldn't say he was intoxicated. He said he was angry and upset with the driver.'

Chair of the bench Eileen Ashton fined him £400 to be paid within 28 days. He was also ordered to pay £150 compensation to the taxi driver and a court fee of £125.

The man who served in the Royal Marines for 10 years before becoming a businessman has previous convictions of drink driving, fraud and 'carrying an offensive weapon'.

In February 2009, he pleaded guilty to possessing an extendable baton and knuckle-duster which was found in his Merceds car.

Police were called to his home following allegations he hit ex-wife Clair and wounded her - drawing blood.

And after completing filming for The Apprentice in 2010, he was reportedly hiding in Spain after his former boss revealed she had fired him due to claims of fraud.

He was working on commission basis for Mortgages4Plymouth when Tricia Kennedy axed him. 

During his appearance in The Apprentice, Farrell said he was a sniper and he took 'that killer instinct across into business'.

Gerry Pachter who was defending Farrell said: 'Mr Farrell regrets his behaviour that night. He is very remorseful but felt the taxi driver had been particularly unpleasant. 

'He had been drinking during the course of the evening. Mr Farrell thought the taxi driver had been aggressive towards him and his partner.

'He recognises that he should've turned a blind eye. The taxi driver pulled up and kicked them out of the taxi - this is what got to them. It was dark and in an unsafe area.'

He added: 'The taxi driver wasn't badly injured and there was no hospitalisation.'

Mr Pachter said Mr Farrell works in a 'very important high profile unit' as a business manager at Port2Port Maritime Security in Salford.

Port2Port provides ships with armed security to fight pirates, using ex-Royal Marines and Army commandos.

Mr Pachter requested Mr Farrell be given a fine instead of a community order because it would be 'very difficult' for him due to his work commitments.
